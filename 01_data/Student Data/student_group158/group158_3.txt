only thing to say about this place...over priced & understaffed! I "Get" the whole covid thing but to understaff the place so much that you feel alienated or unnoticed...not cool!the only person was an employee on their lunch break I wasn't about to disturb her ,not fair/not right...& all I wanted to know was the wifi pw...😕< /text>

Great Pizza thin crust my preferred crust. Choose you sauce, cheeses and toppings with garlic roasted or minced is not considered a topping so one can add with added cost. Good flavor next time I am in the area I will be back👍👍👍👍👍</text>

Awesome Pizza. The best I have had in a very long time. I am so happy to have found this place. We ordered a Sun and Tribune and both were excellent. Will be back for more.<//Review>

<Review>Service has always been really slow here. I always come back because of the great pizza they make. They press the pizza dough on the spot. They probably should do this before hand because customers have to wait for this. I waited 15 minutes for my pizza even though there was only 1 person in front of me. A little inefficient in my opinion.<//Review><time>1549753158170< /time>< Rating>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>By far the best pizza I've had in the city. Because it's always super noisy and crowded in there (the Western Addition location) we always order a pizza to go. While the deep dish is super tasty (and seems to be a favorite of others), I'm actually a fan of the thin crust. If you're looking for a wonderful cornmeal crust pizza for a reasonable price, I definitely recommend Little Star Pizza. If you don't like noise and crowds, I'd recommend phoning in a pick-up order. If crowds and noise adds to the overall dining experience for you, then eat at the restaurant.<//Text>< Pictures>

This place is great-- it's like Zachary's only in the city, without the long wait time to order and tastes better due largely to the delicately sweet cornmeal crust. I would order the Little Star deep dish pizza. Yum!</Text>

Long waits on the weekend, but overall, the pizza is pretty good.  It's not the same deep dish pizza you would get in say  Irvine, CA due to it's texture and fillings, etc, but it's a different kind of good.  It's really filling too.  I eat a lot but usually 3 slices will do me in.  They have a small, yet commendable micro brew selection.  I recommend the  Irvine, CA as it goes well with the pizza.</text>

<text>Pizza Press is essentially Subway in the pizza industry, except much better. They have their own pizzas you can pick, or publish your own! Don't ever be shy with choosing how to make your pizza, it's pretty much endless. Only one thing could have improved my visit: having Diet Coke available instead of out. I won't take stars away though for it.
Please check them out and give it a shot at making your own pizza, you won't be disappointed!< /text><Time>1562608137041<//Time>< userid>

Paradise-like atmosphere. Come here on your weekend off when it's that perfect so-cal weather and have yourself a personal fresh made pizza and BEER, of which there are many choices, and you will feel ultimate relaxation (dining outside). A "daily" one topping pizza should do you good for just 8 bucks.</review>

<review>We ordered 'The Chronicle' added some grilled chicken, spinach, olives and red sauce to it. Tasted really good. Also we had this Metro chicken caprese Salad with some Arugula as a topping. It was fresh and nice. We had to wait in the long line, but it was worth it.< /review>< pictures>

I placed an online order via postmates 20 minutes before arrival. However, when I arrived at the location, my order was not ready. They only started it after I got there. I had to wait for another 30 minutes to pick up my order. That shouldn't have happened. I thought that placing the order online ahead of time would help to avoid the wait but it didn't. Very disappointed.<//Review>< Pictures>

The restaurant is not properly managed, no napkins, table and floors not cleaned after customers.

Today, when I walked in the Woodbridge location, I noticed two workers behind counter were cleaning floors and counters, sweeping floors and wiping down counters. I kept watching to see if they would put on new clean gloves before making food for customers, they DID NOT, but proceeded to make food with contaminated gloves. We walked out without ordering anything.

Probably won’t be going back anytime soon.

We’ve eaten there in the past and the pizzas are OK.</Review>

My suggestions for improvement: They really need to have at least 4 people working during busy hours.  1 making the dough (some should be prepped ahead of time cause this is a bottleneck), 1 on ingredients,  1 taking pizzas out, cutting and adding the finishes and 1 on the register. The guy taking out pizza and working the register at the same time slows down the process a lot.

I come during the evening time after 7pm and it's always so slow even though they have more workers available in the back, they have only 3 people actually working.

BOTTOM LINE: Great pizzas but hindered by an inefficient assembly</Review><name>Vinny<//name></record>

They burnt my pizza. Then when Yi came back to the register to pick up the pizza I had already paid for, I was rudely questioned about if I had paid yet. Then they made my other pizzas with the wrong toppings. Then I had to ask for cookies that weren't crumbled up because they offered me broken cookies. The restaurant was so messy and the tables were nasty and the floor was unswept. Definitely not a good experience and will stick with pieology or blaze instead< /Review>

Great place for pizza and beer with friends. Was introduced to the place during the Irvine half marathon last weekend and checked it out for lunch. A hidden gem right in Woodbridge Irvine.< /Review>

<time>1565922805096<//time><Rating>3< /Rating><Review>Great lunch place and decent dinners too! Pizza press is a build your own pizza place themed on early 20th century printing companies (think newspapers). You start with the size you want they 'press' a blob of dough into a pizza crust,  then you select the type of sauce (marinara,  bechamel,  or white/garlic), next you pick your cheese and toppings.  After that the pizza bakes on a conveyor belt oven, you pick your final toppings/sauce and you're on your way.  They have soda & juice for the kiddos and beer for the adults, and lots of it, whole counter of beers on tap.
The one downside to this location is that it's kid heavy. All locations are popular with the stroller brigade,  but this one is also next to the highschool.  Totally worth it though.</Review><name>Patience Kleine< /name>< Gmap_id>

I've been twice now, the first time service was okay and food was mediocre but not awful.

The second time I went I asked for a couple different ingredients, and the woman behind the counter told me they were out. I shrugged and said okay, but while my pizza was baking another customer asked for the same ingredients, and another worker was walking out to clock out, overheard the customer, and offered to go back and chop some ingredients for the customer.

It was still almost three hours before they closed, the girl just told me no because she didn't feel like chopping some more onions/mushrooms for my pizza. That's the last time I'll go there.<//Text>

We tried to get a pizza with pineapple and a cheesy garlic bread but they were out of pineapple and tried to charge us more for just a plain cheese pizza but than the cheesy garlic bread that had more items. And the man working the actual pizza press didn’t know how to make the pizza round and the man working the cash register didn’t know how to use it< /Review>

We tried this place as we got promotional offer on facebook (Buy 1, Get 1). If you had tried Mod Pizza, Blaze or Pieology then this place doesn't have any wow factor. Here pizza is baked in a conveyor oven unlike in other place where they bake it in pizza oven. I felt a bit let down as it didn't baked my pizza properly. So ask them to bake it for longer if you want a well baked pizza (they will put your pizza back in conveyor). Also I felt the base of their pizza was bit thick, so don't expect a thin crust pizza if you are going for their "Publish you own pizza".< /text>

Me and my husband ordered online since it takes forever to order in person (even when there's 2-3 people in front of you). Waited the half an hour and even hit Barnes & Noble before we showed up 5mins after it should have been ready. They hadn't even started the order! We sat around another 10-15 mins before they brought it out. Ordered at 6pm and they handed us the pizza at 7pm. My husband said he got an email saying they hadn't acknowledged our order after 5mins so to give them a call. Why, to remind them to do their job?? All the napkins were empty, there were no soda lids, the floor was a mess and it wasn't even that busy. The only reason I don't give them 1 star is because their pizza is good and they gave us a coupon for a free pizza. They need to get it together.< /text>

The food was very stale. The salad had very old pieces of lettuce in it which was disappointing. I did not really enjoy this location, but that just means I will not be coming back.</Review>

I have never been to a adult store, Alexandria was very sweet and helpful. She walked around with me for a little bit and answered all my questions. It was a very nice experience, and I will be telling my friends about Suzies in Stockton!< /Review>

I love this place. I can come here and they have everything  I need for all desires. I would absolutely recommend this location. Friendly customer service and helpful staff. They make you feel so comfortable about something so taboo.</Review>

I don’t believe in ordering toys online anymore, have before and they came broken, I’d rather spend a little more and make sure it’s 100% REAL! amazon/eBay they can sell fake toys, these are going into your body!

I have been going to their beautifully designed facility for 7 years, and have worked with so many professional, while at the same time warm-hearted, people.  It's a wonderful "village" atmosphere that the many bilingual employees add to immensely. Thank you, Petaluma Health Center, for seeing me through all life's ups and downs!< /Review>

Came in new from another state and Was treated with kindness and respect. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Even though I sort medical assistants on a sliding scale I was treated with kindness and understanding just as if I were in a private setting. Great staff, super great nurse and a nurse practitioner that treated me with dignity respect. How lucky I am to have found such a wonderful place!<//Text>

HILLARY POWELL is the most unprofessional doctor we have ever had the experience of working with. She lied during our recent appointment and said my husband has a “history of meth use” when he has NEVER used hard drugs in his life. When trying to tell her that the information she has is completely false and putting false info on peoples medical records is not only dangerous but illegal, she hung up during our scheduled phone appointment we waited for for 2 weeks. Did not even offer any type of help or information on the matter. We are currently in process of obtaining all of his medical records and contacting an attorney on the matter for falsifying documents as well as malpractice. Spend the few extra bucks and go to a private doctor that actually knows what they’re doing.

This place is a literal nightmare.< /Text>

We were waited for one hours nobody called than go back to the receptionist why nobody is calling than they said oh you need to go in suit c. I said that’s not my mistake we came 15 minutes before the appointment and we wait for more than one hour, are you kidding. All receptionist always busy talking, rude, unprofessional. All the time  on phones, talking about others dresses and coffee etc. it is just a joke.</Text>

I went in today, after which time my fever shot up 3 degrees. My entire body is sore and it takes effort to stay awake, which I was doing so I could get my prescription. Online pharmacy hours say they're open until 8. They are not. I double-checked my physical prescription and there are no pharmacy hours listed on the sheet. I probably shouldn't have let them give me a flu shot while I already have a fever and infection. So here I am with a fever of 103.7 and I have to go back to work the day after tomorrow with two fewer doses of antibiotics than if they could have gotten my my prescription the same day.

My bill was $200 for a 10-min doctor visitand a flu shot. The doctor didn't even seem to have time for me in those few minutes as she kept answering her own questions instead of letting me answer. The doctor gave me a 30-day supply of Zoloft and now won't let me renew my subscription. Having your body and brain get used to an SSRI and then withdraw from it is really terrible and makes one anxious and suicidal. I hate this place so much.< /Review>

I've been seeing doctors and using their pharmacy for 6 years, and at the risk of sounding too effusive in my praise: I LOVE this place. Thank god (and goddess) for this community resource. If I could complain about one thing and give 4 stars instead of 5, I would. But I have zero complaints. I've gotta wonder about the folks who gave PHC 1 star.
The pharmacy staff is particularly good.
It's places like this that make me proud to be a Californian.</text>

There is very little follow-up care and the moment they see that I have depression/anxiety, I get treated as though my symptoms are imagined instead of indicative of something more serious. I've been shuffled between departments, asked for referrals to an endocrinologist, but they will not refer me or give me the tests I've asked for based on genetic predispositions to certain autoimmune disorders that fit the symptoms I'm having. The OB that they shuffled me off to was so condescending and uncaring, she nearly made me cry during my visit. The day the front of my neck physically swelled up and I went in to have it checked, the doctor (who could hardly keep her head up or keep a train of thought because she was "sorry but she's very tired today") told me it was just anxiety... (I forgot that anxiety causes swollen necks. silly me.) When I left the exam room to use the restroom after asking for tests and being denied them despite the other symptoms and now the swollen front of my neck, I could hear the extraordinarily unprofessional doctor and nurse talking not so kindly about me and about how patients always think they know best. How dare I, a 27 year old woman with menopausal symptoms increasing in severity, ask for several different tests (rather than the ones I've already had 4 times) in an effort to get to the cause of the symptoms. I am extremely disappointed and angry. I may just be a patient but I expect to be treated like they care about my well-being during the appointments rather than making me feel like a burden because I tried to advocate for my health. I've never written a google or yelp review before but they've certainly earned this one.< /review><Date>1514753498521</Date><rating>1< /rating>< user_name>

Dr. Karl Greer Is A 100% First-Class Quality Abuse Of The Power, Rude To Others, Apathetic, Heart-Empty, Negative Attitude, Condescending Burn-Out Syndrome, Diabolical, Abrasive Callous Arrogant Monster That Quit Caring For All Patients A Long Time Ago In The Past And Only Does The Position To Be A Tyrant Which Needs To Be Corrected Immediately!!!
Dr. Karl Greer Is A Real Jaded, Completely Narcissistic, Totally Pompous, Cynical Tyrant With A Superior Attitude Demeanor That Enjoys Contradicting As Far As Using That Medical Education For Talking Down To Patients And Needs To Have A Last Few Words Continually Plus A Huge Lack Of The Humanity And The Last Person To Be Dealing With The Economically Deprived Community (Latinos & Asians Plus Whites & Blacks).</text>

Best medical care I've received anywhere. Everyone I've dealt with from reception, to billing, to my Doctor Carlin Chi, have been outstanding.
This is what medical care in the US could look like.
Very pleased, been getting care here regularly for 3 years.</Text>

<time>1461818958658<//time><rating>1<//rating><Review>I have never written a bad review about a place, but in this case, I cannot keep my mouth shut; I am enraged. I scheduled a physical for my almost three year old son because I needed his eyes checked, as I think his tear ducts do not work properly. But instead of getting anything checked, they asked me a bunch of questions for almost an hour and a half, even bringing in a psychologist because he seemed to be "acting out" and has a lot of energy. Ummm... Duh. He is a two year old boy, who yes, is very active, because his parents are very active.. There is something wrong with this??? My son is very healthy, respectful and a happy kid; he has a great life, surrounded by people who love him, and yet they act like he might have a mental disorder or need to be on drugs. It was an absolute joke! They made a big deal because he was saying no to them for taking his temperature, etc, like it was a bad behavior, but hello? he doesn't know you or what checking his blood pressure is, etc. These doctors were suggesting counseling for myself and my son, parenting classes, but NEVER gave me any answers to any the questions I had or even looked at his eyes. They NEVER examined him, but made him draw? Then they scheduled a second physical to try again in a month. It is all for extra money, a total scam by incompetent "doctors" who treat their patients like an assembly line and do not listen to your needs or what you are telling them. We will NOT be going back there. And I am going to call to make a formal complaint. All my previous experiences have been fine, especially for myself in women's health. But this experience was awful!!! They might want to consider having the doctors who work with kids be doctors who actually have kids or possess common sense.what has happened to healthcare and doctors that are in it for the right reasons and actually care about their patients?<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

I love the offices themselves, they are colorful, clean, and  roomy. A lot of wonderful competent people all around. BUT, everytime that I have gone there's always seems to be a slip up somehow.  One of the GYNO docs there seemed to have given me the wrong prescription which then also took 2 weeks to get it right, and one of the worst bedside manners EVER! Rude and Grumpy!! Or a nurse will promise to FAX a prescription for you, but never does. Or the billing in patient's portal is never updated, so you get charged over and over for the
same bill. The receptionists must be overworked or something--I have NEVER seen one of them SMILE! Anyway, I know they are trying to do their best, but something somehow  always goes AMISS. It doesn't function well as a whole. Definitely not a well oiled machine. I just went in there today and they were rude again and would not give me there appropriate charge for the same medicine.  BUT, the Rohnert Park Facility is way better!</review><Rating>1</Rating>< pictures>

<Text>They treat their patients like drug addicts, lack knowledge every gp should have, perform mandatory drug tests without permission - without even listing it in their paperwork. And if you are insulted when you find out and complain, the next time they see you the assistant will lie to get what she wants. Dr Chi was incompetent and condescending. She ignored complications from hyper mobility and acute pain and suggested I try yoga (dangeous for me) or acupuncture. (No more affective than a placebo) The nurse practitioner, Darcie was better and the receptionists were great. But I won't be going back. Not trustworthy.<//Text>< Pics>

I wouldn't say it's the best place, but if you aren't planning on staying in the area for long or you rarely ever go to the doctors (like me) this is good enough to get you by.<//Review>

Kinda a joke! Went in with a back sprain, been going on for 4 days and the NP (don't even know if they even have real doctors there) does nothing, checks of the back and tells me EXACTLY what I just told them!! It was a joke! No help and they DO treat people like drug addicts!!<//Text>

<Review>Wonderful team to work with. The arborist was great at explaining his recommendations. They are ethical, as there were several trees he recommended not trimming but rather  reassessing in 2-3 years. That tells me they are doing it right and not just for the money. I will definitely be using them for all tree maintenance from here out.</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

They did a great job. I was very concerned that my 50 foot tulip tree may have to come down completely but they found it was still viable. The tree looks much better and healthier. The shape is now more proportional.
Thank you and your team!</review>

There were 2 large Sycamore Trees and a large evergreen.   The team worked fast and efficiently to clean up.  The trees have good air now and we shouldn't be covered with dead branches for a while.</text>

I highly recommend Quality Tree Care!< /text><userid>101109375362431045768< /userid>< pics>

<Review>Having used Quality Tree Care for tree trimming and pruning and being very pleased, I decided to have two very tall and leaning pine trees removed.  Joe gave a very fair estimate and a reasonable date for removal. He is an arborist and informed me of beetle infestation. The day arrived for removal.  Andrew, the foreman was on time, as were all workmen.  All were very courteous. They began immediately and were industrious all day long,practicing safety and  cleaning at the end not only my premises but my neighbor who had given permission for branches to fall in their yard.  I give this recommendation without reservation.  You won’t be disappointed.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Protected the sides of the house and front windows with plywood, something other tree companies have never done.
Clean up was exceptional - like they were not even here!!
Highly recommend!!</text>

From scheduling to meet with Danny, to the crew that came out led by Andrew this company has exceeded my expectations! They were friendly, careful and efficient.  They also made sure that none of my plants were damaged and took care to move everything back before they left.  If I could I would give them 10 stars! Great job.<//review>

I had two sides of my yard that I cut back after 30 years and they did the stump grinding plus cut back a massive tree in the front.  I was shocked when only 2 guys showed up but Andrew was a rockstar and got it all finished and didn't leave a mess.  Like an idiot I had laid down new sod before the tree was cut and he even took care to not damage the new grass as they pruned the tree.  Will be my go to for tree work from now on.</Review><Resp>None</Resp><username>Rafal Preis</username><time>1604497771370< /time>< user>

< Review>
The guys over at Quality Tree Care did a fantastic job cutting done our pepper tree. We got several quotes from different companies, all of which quoted us at $200-$700 more than what Quality tree care quoted us. Very reasonable and competitive pricing. The main guy, Andrew, was very friendly and professional. Highly recommend! Will be using their services again in the future.</Review>

The three men who came to trim my trees had arrived early and I was not home.  I would have appreciated a call notifying me they were going to be early so that I could have been there when they started.  Quite a bit had already been cut (a little too high still.)  However, they were immediately responsive, reread the order, and did not hesitate to efficiently trim back the tree to requested specs.  And all with a smile!  Truly, their customer comes first.
These men were incredibly skilled at getting my "PG&E Hack Job" sycamore looking not just "normal, but terrific again!  They were always safety conscious, worked quickly, and also expertly pruned 2 trees in the back.  And when they were done, there was ZERO debris left behind.  ZERO!!  That was amazing.  I had beautiful trees and a beautiful yard again.
Look no further -- Call Joe at Quality Tree and get the job done on time at a fair price by professionals.  What a great job!  I will not only recommend them to friends, I will definitely be using them again.<//Text>

<text>The service provided was beyond my expectations. The two gentlemen doing the work were prompt, informative, efficient, and quality of work.

They did a great job with the tree and focused on clean-up (and verifies I was satisfied with both tree and clean up)

Will definitely use this Quality Tree Care in the future.</text></record>

<review>Joe and  his team have worked on our trees twice over the last few years - both tree trimming on our large ashes and removing a few dead trees.  We've had a great experience both times.  I've also emailed Joe with "tree questions" in between - and he's been kind enough to offer advice.  Highly recommended!<//review><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_id>

Great work, affordable, and reliable.  Staff come to appointments on time and  call the day before to confirm appointment. My only feedback for improvement would be a quicker response to work requests and scheduling after an estimate has been given. I sent an email request in late October, the estimate was made on 12/7, and they were able to complete work on 1/6.  That being said, I’m sure the response would have been immediate if one of my trees fell over.<//Text>

If I could of given more stars I would have!! I have talked with several other tree services in the area and Quality Tree Care has, by far, been the best. I contacted them on a Sunday evening (because that's when I was up researching) and received a text right away. Danny showed up the next day and quickly surveyed the tree I needed help with. He gave me a quote immediately & could do the work the next day. I was thrilled!! He even gave me a coupon discount I knew nothing about. BUT...what impressed me beyond belief was the voicemail I received after the job was completed. The fellows who were cutting down the tree found a nest with baby birds in it. They carefully removed the piece of the tree with the nest, placed that piece up on a stump and even took the time to create a roof type structure over the nest with some bark from the tree. My heart was sad that I'd removed the home of a family of birds but when I got home & saw how they had treated it with such respect & kindness, my heart warmed a bit. I covered the little house they created with some jasmine branches and happily watched mama bird return to her nest. Thank you so very much Quality Tree Care for your amazing service, to not just me & my old broken tree but for your compassion to it's feathered residents.< /Text>

Really a positive experience for me!

They gave me space to look throughout the store and then when I approached with a question they provided so much great feedback. It felt like you called up an old friend and they were genuinely excited to share the love of fishing with you. Thanks to John who helped me out and pointed me in the right direction. Definitely made a customer for life.<//Review>< pics>

<review>It's always a pleasure to Angler's Arsenal . I bought my first Accurate 2 speed and pole from Dave and now just helped me with my 2nd match up rod to another Accurate 2 speed that I bought from Turner's . their very inquisitive to helping the angler understanding what their using and great tips . so if your in Lakeside stop in and check the store out you'll walk out with better knowledge and understanding of your tackle and gear . thanks Dave</review>< Pictures>

There are 2 tackle shops that i go to in San Diego. Angler's Arsenal is one of them. I can trust the guys to help pick out tackle and gear, and feel confident in the choices made. Everyone is very friendly and not cocky a**holes like some tackle shops. Love these guys and rep them whenever/wherever i can.< /Text>

Many thanks for assisting me with a gift certificate purchase for my nephew for his birthday! I'm out of town, and he absolutely LOVES the store. Being able to purchase from afar is a huge help.  After speaking with the mgt. team there at the store over the phone, I heartily agree that Angler's Arsenal is by far and away amongst the most helpful and knowledgeable in the business.
We're up in Washington state and it was great to "fish-speak" and share happenings between north and south. I look forward to my nephew showing me the store on my next visit to SD!
Kudos and cheers!</review>

Great fresh water shop.  Cocky, but very knowledgeable staff.  Minus a star for cocky, which might intimidate novice fishermen.  Minus another star for "yes, we carry salt water tackle", when they only have some cursory salt water gear.  Not quite an arsenal, more like a quiver.  This is a predominantly a fresh water tackle shop.< /review>

<text>Angler's Arsenal is an awesome tackle store! I love visiting Capt. Cassidy to check out his new loot. Baja Fishing Convoys totally recommeds this family owned business!
Eric J. Cummings obviously is so new to fishing that he does not know you to not diss our family. For your information Mr. Cummins, all tackle shops have to watch what they put on the counter. Especially if someone unknown, like you, show up asking to look at stuff. People have walked off with gear in a split second.  Unless you formally apologize and delete your ridiculous review, good luck getting any help from any of us in the industry. You dissed a major veteran in our field. Oh and we dont call it being rude. We call it being salty ya rookie!!!</text>< pictures>

Shopping at Angler's Arsenal is the best experience I ever had at a bait & fishing tackle shop and quite possibly one of the best customer service experiences I ever encountered at ANY business! John Jr. and Jon the father and son combo who run Angler's Arsenal and Western Plastics (the company name for their custom plastic lures) are stand-up guys! I came in to Angler's Arsenal this weekend after having a disappointing day at one of the local lakes. I came here in search of some professional fishing guidance and some tackle suggestions. What I received from Jon was on point:* Friendly and more than willing to help answer my questions.* No short answers nor quick 'Yes' responses I've encountered at many other tackle shops.* In depth description of their custom-made plastics (Western Plastics).* Suggestions on bait that is working and how to work them.* I learned that they sell individual plastics which means you can buy onesies and twosies of 4" straight tail worms, 6" curly tail worms, 9" fat worms, 3" craw daddies, 3" flukes, 5" flukes, small frogs, large frogs, etc. etc.  in several color and pattern choices! (This is great because you no longer need to purchase full packs of plastic bait and you can 'sample' various items until you find what you like and what works best at your fishing hole!).I will absolutely be coming back to Angler's Arsenal for most, if not all of my fishing gear needs! Because of my incredible experience this weekend at the shop I will be telling all my friends about how great this place is and recommend they come see John and Jon to get great tackle, excellent service and fishing tips.<//review>

This B of A has the worst customer service. It is the closest bank to my home but if I have the option, I will always drive to another location. Dulce declined to help my newly adopted twin daughters because they were closing in 20 min. They had no one waiting for personal bankers so this is just not the customer service I expect from my financial institution. Drove across the street and the bank was also closing soon but actually got great customer service. So I will be moving my account from B of A as well.</review>

<Text>The people behind the desks are very helpful but the teller service is terrible. Maybe the customers require lots of attention. The wait in line is ridiculous. Not only is the wait ridiculous but this branch has been closed for weeks and when you try to make an appointment using the website it's impossible. It's also impossible to reach them by phone. I deal with 2 other banks and neither of them is as lame as Bank of America. I can hardly wait to get over there so I can close my account.<//Text><date>1611082547220<//date><userid>109258918468258592348< /userid><Rating>2< /Rating><response>{'time': 1611078099892, 'text': "Hi James.

The manager promised to call me in regards to a safe box that I had closed out over 10 years ago which I was billed and she never did and then I receive a large bill. This is unbelievable, One of the largest bank with not good staff specially at this branch and a malfunction system with no records but will bill you for it even when I was told that the safe box came with the account and was then closed when I closed my account. Then was promised that they will schedule to drill the box and will let me know to be there. Never happened, instead I receive a $512 bill and when called the customers service, they are telling me to go back to the branch, this will be my 3rd trip. All because of one person not know how to do their job correctly and their system.<//Text>

How can you staff this branch on a Friday afternoon with only one teller?!? Has the customer service at BofA really lost all that luster from it's glory days as one the world's largest and best banks in the business?!? I've been a business customer for many years and each time I go to a new branch I am finding the same thing: run down branches and skeleton staff. Very sad.<//Review>

Alison and Jessica are AMAZING!!!! Ana rocks too!!!  But 1 bank teller, no merchant line, and 1 bank teller on a Friday.. yes Friday!!!  I would think a bank would know this is PAYDAY!!! Maybe anticipate your customer's needs and staff yourself better?  Line is 15 people deep and nobody is happy.. Nobody.< /Review>

Every banking center strives to get the best score in customer service except this branch.... I am a retired BOFA associate & I was treated with unprofessionally, humiliation & disrespect by " Letitia  Reyes" the assistant manager... I even asked for the manager ...she didn't even bother giving me his name or business card.. It was a struggle getting her bus. Card< /Review>

<Review>This is by far the worst bank I have ever been to.   Bank of America is a horrible bank, but this branch is the worst branch.  They are super slow, horrible customer service, the employees stand around talking to each other instead of working even when the line is out the door, and there is NO MERCHANT LINE!  Worst branch ever.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.</Review>< pics>

I am or one of the ATM customers than one that goes in and as an ATM customer the location is a bit close to the closest streets and the freeway and the parking could get a little bit crazy sometimes.   Otherwise it serves as purpose for an ATM location.<//Review>

At 9:21 a.m. we were standing in line for 10 minutes and the long line that we were standing didn’t move an inch. It was a work day and there was only one employee there. Another employee came in 20 minutes late and started eating her food, though she was already late. I had to leave without being helped.<//Review>

First time customer and I had a great experience. The owner was very friendly and made buying what I needed a breeze. Fully recommend coming here for anyone looking to buy anything hookah related.

I called ahead wondering what the process would be during these times. He answered the phone quickly and informed me to park in the parking lot and call back so he can help me. We made our way into the store, and the options available are great. He had a wide variety of products and the store itself was nice.

He does curbside pickup and delivery as well. The owner obviously cares about customer service and making sure the customer is satisfied.<//Text>

I have never seen a person as a salesman to help and not push to buy something.
Thank you Sako for your help, he gave me a chance to try some type of things for my bong before I buy.

Called every where for the ”Optimo’s” Citi smokes came through I contacted them they answered in a professional manner. Initially called in but but they did not have what I wanted they ordered the items and had me pick them up. They also setup delivery for your items as well.<//text>

<review>I have been using oil consultants for too long. I was so happy to have met the best people out there. They tried so hard to make them the right people, in the right place, in the right time. They've taken their work really easy. Ok, highly recommended operation!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Gave cashier $2.00 and told him I'll get the change 13cents from the car. Went back with change and he refused to give me my purchase and said you never gave me $2.00.
What a liar. Money was on the counter with drawer open. You can see it I have posted the pictures. filled up gas worth $45 and got ripped off by cashier for $2.00. I told him to check the cameras and he didn't want to,also asked for his manage's phone number and he would act like he is dead and can't listen. What a jerk.< /Text>

< Review>
My visit was less than satisfactory. In a word "disappointing". On this very Sunday at around 4 o'clock I entered the store to an associate being very friendly with a customer and the customer being very gracious as to interrupt and end her conversation so that I a new customer cod be helped well after explaining that after a friend used my phone for a short while my SD was no longer mounting she took a look and RIGHT away she assessed that there was damage and that was probably the reason for the unmounting...naturally being shocked I asked what could be done about it...and right off hand she said that it required a special tool to remove the said SD card and that they at that particular location did not have this tool and that I would have to take it to a phone repair shop, all the while I'm looking at the tool she is talking about right UNDER HER ARM! Not being from the particular area I simply accepted my phone from her and walked out of the establishment with more nothing than when I walked in...i don't know if she didnt want to do the work or if she didn't  know ho1 tondonit but either way this is a very dissatisfied customer and I LOVE Metro PCS...I will continue to be a loyal customer but I will never step foot into this location.<//Review>

Very good customer service. I appreciate the information they provide because I understand what I'm paying for. I wasn't pleased about the activation fee they have but after the work they did on my phone and the apps I asked for to get installed I can't really complain about it. Big thanks to Juan and Fernando. They are amazing guys!< /review>

I cannot believe this plan I have with Metro PCS.  I have called three times to make sure it is not a mistake.  Francisco at the PCS Store in Santa Monica CA store took care of me.  The service I have works for me to call to and from Mexico.  This has meant all the difference in my life.  The price is so little for what you get.  I am a living testament to the really excellent service PCS is and I highly recommend them as a carrier.  I have called the store in Santa Monica several times with questions and Fernando was also a big help as well as a young lady.  I am bowled over with their service.  Excellent.< /review>

I was delighted how everything went out smoothly. I read the other comments and i find it confusing that people complain about a 20 dollar charge for a SIM card. Overall I would recommend this store to my friend and family.

My boyfriend had his iphone stolen and he bought a new phone and went to this metropcs to buy a new sim card. They wanted to charge $20 for the sim card + $20 for a transfer. I said we don't need to transfer anything cuz his line is already from metropcs.  But the guy said that was the deal. So i called another metropcs store that i usually go and they always resolve everything and the lady said i will just have to pay $15 for the sim card and that's it.
Some stores of metropcs have employee that act kind of weird and don't know how to resolve problems. I truly felt like the guy was trying to take advantage of me.< /Text>

Despite its looks and location, it's got one of the cleanest and nicest smelling restrooms! Beautiful faucet with evenly flowing water. And I'm only talking up their restroom so much because their food is actually just ok.</Text>

I got the zetton soy ramen which was nothing special besides being the restaurants moniker. The broth was a little to strong and just didn't blend together well. The chashu was good and they give you a decent amount especially if you order extra. The noodles were chewy but the ramen as a whole wasn't perfect but good for a ramen fix</Text>

< Review>
I lived in japan for about 2 years as a United States Marine. I missed the culture and the food, and honestly every time I enter in I'm always greeted with a smile by the staff and always given a welcome in Japanese. I know a tiny bit of Japanese and I try my best to respond in Japanese. (I hope the staff don't think I'm being rude :P). But anyway the food taste exactly as If I was back in japan. That's why they will always have me comeback again and again. Rated 5 stars.<//Review>

The noodle wasn't cooked completely, had some crunchy taste. The inner part of the pork on the soup was cold. The soup itself tasted awful, it was smelly. The restaurant was full with some gas smell.  I really don't recommend this ramen place.<//Review>

<text>First time visit.  Great customer service and big portions, with good prices.  Ramen noodles was smooth and good flavor.  However, the soup was bland and the habanero dipping sauce wasn't even hot. Chili oil tasted stale.  The meat wasn't fresh.  It tasted like it was prepared several days earlier and then warmed up with the microwave.  BTW: I don't think this is a Japanese Ramen restaurant because the wait and cooking staff were Latinos and they were speaking Spanish.</text>< name>

The Ramen is awesome. Order the spicy garlic TanTam. Ambience sucked. They had heavy metal and grunge playing the whole time I was there.</Review>

<text>It was finally open after coming several times at the wrong time, don’t know if it’s new owner or what but it wasn’t as good as before and now you get sat down with menu, get up to order and pay, get up again to get your ramen and  get up again for forks, hot sauce, water, to go container. Definitely not coming back...< /text>< pics>

My wife ate pork salt ramen and I ate bibimbap early this afternoon.

Both order taste good and the servings are geneous. Price is reasonable.
We share food as we always do.

If if you are around the neighborhood and crave for ramen, this place is a good option. Although I believe their original location in costa mesa tastes better, this place serves a decent bowel of ramen.

Tips: if you go during lunch hours 11:3 to 3 pm, you can enjoy a small bowel from a few choices for 2 dollars.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

There are a few different options and they all sounded great. We ordered 2 different types of ramen bowls and a wide order of the chicken fried rice. All of it was absolutely delicious!! Best fried rice I've had in years. The green tea wss also awesome, we ordered one hot and one cold and both were refreshing. Staff was very friendly and accommodating . Service was quite fast as well. If you like pho or ramen this place is a MUST TRY!!</review>< GmapID>

<review>Fantastic!! I just had the miso ramen. I substituted the pork broth and it was amazing! If I lived in LA, I'd be back at least once a week. Glad I gave it a shot.

The menu has an extensive list of ramen varieties, including Korean themed bowls and vegetarian broths. They also have donburi and Japanese curry options.</review><Rating>5</Rating>< Time>

<Gmap_id>0x80dd2ea7815c0247:0x2a465a172d025a2c<//Gmap_id><Review>Zetton on it!  Zetton on it!

Ramen Zetton, the popular Costa Mesa ramen shop, has a new branch nearby me in Cypress.  For their soft opening, Ramen Zetton has priced their ramen bowls from $5 - $7.  Being a ramen lover & not one to pass up a discount, I hurried down to Ramen Zetton, eagerly awaiting slurping up some piping hot ramen.

The traditional ramen condiments are well represented - chili oil, white pepper grinder, vinegar, red chili pepper & house made spicy miso chili paste.

The house made spicy miso chili paste has a definite kick to it.  Not for spice weaklings.

I went for their signature Sesame Miso Tantan ramen ($7, reg. price $8.50)-

The tantan ramen broth is thick, almost curry-like.  Adding the entire jar of spicy miso chili paste, the broth became almost akin to marinara.  Plus, a splash of vinegar, some chili pepper, a drizzling of chili oil, freshly ground white pepper & a splash or 2 of vinegar. The vinegar is what really kicked the flavor profile up a notch.   Hearty & rich, the sesame miso tantan consisted of a special blend of sesame & miso, chicken broth, green onion, ground pork & vegetable puree.  The ramen had a good bite to it.  My preference would've enjoyed them more al dente, but I was not disappointed with the wonderfully thick broth & juicy chunks of ground pork.  At $7, a delicious bowl that's a must get!

Not feeling soup today?  Ramen Zetton's simplistic menu also has various rice dishes & gyoza for your consideration.

Service was good.  I arrived a few minutes before opening.  The father of the owner of Ramen Zetton was running the place.  The cook called in sick & one from the Costa Mesa location was brought in to save the day.  My water was refilled on a couple occasions & I was even given containers of the spicy miso chili paste to take home, w/o asking.  Not a place for large groups, seating is minimal with a few tables, booths & bar seating.

Parking is in private lot.  Hard to spot from the street, Ramen Zetton is located behind Oodles of Noodles Pho Restaurant & adjacent to Poki Roll.

Hurry & get down to Zetton!  Ramen Zetton serves up soothing bowls of ramen that are priced cheaper than their competitors.  The sesame miso tantan ramen was a winner & I'm eagerly anticipating trying their other ramen offerings.  I can't procrastinate, though, as I want to take advantage of Ramen Zetton's soft opening pricing.  Hungry for soup? Check out Ramen Zetton!

Highly recommend!

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>Former place for Cambinos and Teriyaki Monkey Wave rises Ramen Zetton. If you've been to this location, you would know how small this kitchen and seating is. I would say it seats about 24-30 people max.  Lots of parking in the lot, near by Icon (For you craft beer people)

As for the Ramen, prices are still discounted for Classic ($5), Old School ($5), Special Salt ($6), Special Soy ($6). Of course, we tried one of each.  The noodles for the $5 are thinner (Chuka-Soba), while the Ramen for the $6 are thicker. The broth for the Classic tasted packaged, the Old school Shoyu had a light soy (my favorite) and the Specials had this Vegetable broth which was a bit too much I thought.

Non of the broth tasted in depth, unlike those day long tonkotsu broths but for what you get, it's okay. The chicken that does come with the noodle tasted like shoyu braised with sugar and that was just okay too. Kitakata is nearby, personally I would go there instead.

Service here with one person is pretty awesome I have to say, even with a packed house.
Yep check in gets you free soda currently.  I will have to make another trip to try the other noodles.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>The glam and reviews definitely tricked us on this one. The only thing that’s nice, updated and fancy is the entrance and check in section on the 1st floor. After that, once you hit the floor the rooms are on, you get a outdated motel vibe. Room, walls, floors are very outdated and basic, bed is horrible felt like mattress that was worked to the springs then given away.. Bathroom has a mix of both outdated and a little bit of updates but no space for amenities at all. To top it off the price you pay definitely doesn’t make you feel good about what you get.. I’m assuming it’s only high due to the airport convenience and so they can eventually renovate.. It has potential it definitely needs to be updated though. Not satisfied for the price I paid for. If it was more realistic and reasonable I would’ve understood and just had to have taken that L.</Text>< Response>

<date>1618730449123<//date><text>The hotel is very nice! The staff was very friendly, the hotel was very clean, and it was fairly quiet despite it's proximity to the airport. However, what made the experience less than excellent were two things:
1. Ordering food from the restaurant involved standing in a line for 15 minutes at the bar, because there were only one person taking the orders and another person making drinks (they were also going back and forth to the kitchen to grab orders). I was overwhelmed just watching them.
2. The restaurant menus in the rooms are out of date. So imagine you've settled on your order, and you're told that you must place your order at the bar because placing your order in advance (over the phone) for pick up is not an option. Then, you wait 15 minutes in line to place your order only to be told that your desired item is no longer on the menu and the room menus are out of date.  Finally, you only have a few minutes to try to find another item on the menu before the 10 people behind you become agitated because you're taking a lot of time with the only waitress in the entire restaurant. That entire system is a disaster.

I also noticed the front desk was understaffed. There's more than enough stations to remain socially distant.</text>< rate>

Common areas are visibly dated: carpets are frayed, trim is scuffed, dinged, and bent. Rooms are comfortable and have efficient and quiet air-conditioning system with easy controls. The bed was nice and clean but a little too soft for my taste. Bathrooms was  clean and updated. I had a nice walk-in shower.</Review>

<review>The hotel itself is decent. Nice modern look and the room was nice. Only 2 elevators worked so there was a long line to go up. The lobby was full of people coming in and out, front desk was not very pleasant. The lobby smelled loud, but hey what can you expect it's LA. We stayed at the Hyatt Regency last week on our way out and it was much nicer.</review>< pics>

<rate>3</rate><Review>This hotel was pretty busy when we went. The rooms were clean, the staff was nice and the beds were more than comfy! The only problem was when we checked in and went to grab our bags the police had someone surrounded in the parking lot! We were kind of blocked off until someone helped us get out. So, that was a little scary. The parking lot lot fills up fast you have to park on the street or pay for parking in the back of the hotel.< /Review>< pictures>

(Mary) the general manager very unprofessional very inconsiderate! sometimes it’s not what you say but how you say it.. I have reservations but my family & I just received confirmation that our mother will be released from the hospital Sunday morning So I tried to cancel my reservations for at least Sunday I spoke to another party that books they reservations and they stated (it’s up to the hotel to refund my money) i’m trying to figure out what the hotel will be losing if they refund me my money (absolutely nothing) my mother been in the hospital for 3 long months But God is good I will continue to be a Hilton honors member I just decided to step out the box Life happens and Somethings be out of our control a little compassion will take you a Long Way.<//review>

Pre-COVID, I used to always stay at this hotel on my trips to LA but it has really changed. No more bell hop, no more valet parking, no more house cleaning, etc. you now have to sign a paper attesting to all of these rules and regulations as well. It’s not the place it used to be. Also the crowd that is staying here now is very different and every hallway and room reeks of marijuana. I will no longer be staying here anymore.<//text>

What I didn't care for: Too many guest smoking weed. AC in room needs cleaning. Had to change rooms. No water pressure in either room, small showers, very small. Desk chair was too modern and uncomfortable. Can't buy movies on the TV. No microwave in rooms, no room service, no free parking, no breakfast restaurant. We stayed 6 nights, still waiting on guest services to fix the tv and phone in the room.</Review></record>

<Review>Positive: I like the fact that I could bring my dog, because my boarding plan did not work out.  They were very nice about that.  In fact, I had to book the same day after canceling my registration at another hotel that did not allow pets.  I would tell my friends. Negative: I had to get my toilet unstopped and it had not been used. They were very quick to come fix the problem after I reported it.</Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< rate>

The stay was good, our room was clean and so was the lobby. Check in and check out was easy.
There was a strong smell of marihuana everywhere though. I did have to call the lobby once from my room because someone was smoking marihuana either in the hall or their room and the smell of it was coming into our room. Overall a good stay. I will say parking is expensive $50 a day. We parked our rental in the parking lot behind the hotel for 17.50 a night.</Text>

The rooms have quite a contemporary feel which is a nice change from the usual Sheraton offering, and the hotel bars and restaurants are welcoming and nice too.< /Review>< Pics>

Don’t stay here if you want a decent shower.  This BS hotel installed water saver shower heads, you’d be better off using a squirt gun.  I’ll be asking for my money back and not staying here again until they fix the situation.</Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Such a horrible experience. All the parks in front was full. They make you park all the back in the back which is dangerous. Everything is extremely overpriced. 20$ for a sandwich and fries. Front desk did not pick up the phone once out of the 3 days we tried to call. They put us in a handicap room, with automatic doors, the door was broke so it took longer to shut so if anyone had plans on rushing through your door they will easily have success. Room was super stuffy no fresh air: every time you leave you will be charged additional cost to park their. I usually don’t do reviews on hotels but I had to. SMH I won’t ever stay ANY Sheratons every again, place was just overall creepy.</Text>< Pics>

Location is the best thing here. Rooms were okay. Biggest drawback is the smell. Plan to smell weed and cigarettes for the time that you are here. Before walking in, inside the lobby, inside the elevator, inside the hallways, and of course, inside your room.</Text>

<Rate>3</Rate><Text>I called for an upcoming trip and asked about the Club Floor.  It was explained the Club Room was closed for COVID but i could still book a club floor room.  I asked if I booked a regular room, what would be the cost to upgrade to the Club Room of reopened.  The receptionist on April 6 at 3:30pm said she would check and placed me on hold for 7 minutes.  After the wait, I redialed and asked if the price was available.  I was again placed on hold by the same the receptionist without saying anything.  After a lengthy wait, I tried one more time and there was no answer.  Maybe caller ID?  Anyway, it’s unusual for the Sheraton to have questionable customer service so I hope this is read by the hotel as I would like to continue staying at that location when in LA.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1617900666431, 'text': "It's truly disappointing to learn that your experience fell short of our usual service, and we want to apologize.

Not sure what happened to this property but covid hasn’t been good to it. As others have posted, the smell of marijuana is enough to knock you over. It starts from the moment you walk on the property to the time you get to the room. The staff is very accommodating but the guests that are staying there are not exactly business traveler, it’s almost as if it’s become a homeless shelter. I feel bad for staff that has to do deal with it.</review>

The staff were very nice. We were offered an upgrade to a suite. It was very clean and spacious. Two luggage racks yahoo. The restaurant was closed but you could order food to eat outside or in a public area. Same with the bar. All packaged in takeout ware. We were offered a wake up call. No Netflix. All the other Marriott hotels we stayed in offered Netflix. There was construction outside that started before 6 am. No fault of the hotel but you know. Parking was $50 a night. Crazy. I returned the rental car the night before to avoid that charge. For the price we paid for a night was a bargain. Would stay again.< /review>

Waited 15 minutes to check in. Was not told till I checked in (11pm) that the alarms tests would be going on from midnight till 5am. They could not produce room keys so had to wait for someone to unlock door, and when I went for ice I had to leave room unsecured. WiFi went out at midnight. Plus, in general, the clientele seemed pretty low class.<//Text>

Never experienced a parking set up like that before.<//review>< Pics>

We are returning customers to this beautiful island and hotel. The staff was still an absolute credit to this well run hotel. Nothing was too much trouble, and they work incredibly hard and always manage it with a smile! A big shout out to the day time entertainment staff especially loved the dance classes and all it has to offer. We will be returning for a third visit soon!<//Review>

Inexpensive hotel! I was surprised when I was able to get a room at a very affordable rate. The staff is very friendly, and the room is so big and comfy. This is very different from all the hotels I've used before. They have excellent customer service and work ethics. A very remarkable and solid experience. Thank you!<//Review>

Water pressure in the shower was really low, the couch in the room is almost unusable because the room is too small, there's construction going on right behind the hotel at midnight, and it looks like there's only one elevator operating because there's a huge line at the elevators. Would not recommend</review>

A great hotel with quick access to LAX!  The rooms are clean, and the staff is remarkable.  It also has one of the most impressive member lounges. Suppose you have a layover or immediate access to the airport; this is your place!<//Text>

< review>
The hotels itself looked amazing, I made the mistake to book the stay through booking.com and I picked the incorrect dates. While I called booking.com and also the hotel, no one could make changes to my reservation. This lead to me losing 600 for my family first trip. Booking.com said the manager Michelle asked them not to call them back that they would not make any adjustments and therefor I had to cancel my whole vacation with my husband and kids. I was literally In tears knowing  I had to cancel the whole trip and was now out 600. I don't understand why if my staynwas over 2 months out, why they couldn't work to get me at least the stay charged even if they had charged me a few dollars more. I was so disappointed and broke now with this amount out of pocket.<//review>

<text>Needed a place close to the airport and this place was available for about $100.
Overall the room was nice average has a small refrigerator no bath tub just shower (looked like they were recently remodeled)
Nothing special but exactly what I needed.
The reason I give a 4.5 (can’t add half a star)  it’s because I forgot my iPhone in the room and the lose and found kept it. I was able to locate my phone and they confirmed having it and all I did was pick up a few days later. That kind of customer service/ honestly on the house keeping is what gave them the extra start
But parking is ridiculous $50 a night in front of the entrance or 17.55 in the back but no in and outs</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Your parking rates are not competitive. Valet is less at a Marriott than self park is at your place. Due to the lies in your reply you lose 2 stars</text>

<review>Positive: The location was perfect for my flight arrangements, the room was really clean and comfortable.  The staff was really nice and helpful especially security. Negative: Yes I didnâ€™t like the self parking situation, it was really far from the entrance to the hotel there was no other way to enter.  When it starts to rain people are going to get really wet walking that long distance.</review>< pictures>

Sheraton deleted or Google deleted my review. So I'll add it again.

Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles Hotel
Hotel
PLACE DETAILS

Valerie Brown

18 hours ago
I never thought I would be giving the Sheraton a 1 star review. I have stayed at this hotel on Century for years. Whenever my family and I travel to LA this is the only hotel we love to stay at.

Our first trip in while since COVID, and we booked the Sheraton. The lady in the room next to us was screaming in the hallway frantically the first night saying someone was following her and she was crying and very distraught. We thought well, that's scary but it could happen to anyone, and at least security had come to talk to her. Later that night about midnight, she was screaming and yelling and laughing and being extremely loud. This was Thursday, Friday night same thing. I told my husband I wanted to move rooms, I'm a light sleeper and I was up all night again. Saturday morning, as we we were getting ready to leave for the morning, her and her room occupant start screaming and yelling and things are being thrown against our wall. There's tons of yelling she is screaming help, he's going to kill me, I hope you go to jail. I called the front desk immediately, and they said they'd send someone up. This screaming and yelling went on for over 45 minutes in to the hall way and back into the room, to the point we couldn't leave our room without having to get involved or into the middle of it. We called again and they said they never sent anyone the first time. She went running down the hall screaming bloody murder and he chased after her, finally security came but they were gone. They were physically fighting and destroying hotel property.

Finally when security came they banged down my door and accused me of being loud and disruptive and receiving complaints. I had to explain it was the next room over.

We were able to get a room change at that point, but to top all of this off, not one time did they bring us new towels, clean our rooms, or even knock to offer to clean our rooms. Were there 4 days, and not once an offer for fresh towels or taking out the trash or refilling our coffee. Further more, we needed an extra blanket which took over 3 hours to receive. I called it in at 7:30 to 8pm and didn't receive it until 11-11:30pm.  All very disappointing and frustrating and security could not have been more useless when there was a serious SERIOUS issue going on, that woman  could have been killed by her boyfriend or whoever that was and they didn't come, they didn't even try to help. Thats some serious liability they are taking on, especially for other hotel guests being put in danger. They just let this crazy scene unfold for over 45 minutes.

People were smoking weed in the halls and everywhere we turned we ran into issues. This hotel has gone down hill. We have always loved the convenience, amenities and top notch service we've received in years past.  I'm not sure if its because of COVID or bad management but this hotel is garbage.  We will not be staying here ever again.</Review>

Great hotel, nice clean rooms that are a good size. Hip and stylish decor. Very close to LAX, airplane noise isn't a problem. Staff is helpful and friendly.</review>

<Review>My family and I visit Los Angeles 3 times a year, for the past 8 years. This has been our hotel of choice all these year. We’ve watched it go downhill first hand. From service, uncomfortable beds and pillows. The dirtiness. The Starbucks is a hit or miss. Looks like the only thing this hotel puts money into is the lobby. Once you get off the elevator you’re at a Motel 6. After this stay we will never stay at this hotel again.< /Review><userid>109461243632579896566<//userid>< Response>

AVOID THIS HOTEL—YOU HAVE OPTIONS.  I used a third party service (hotels.com) to book this hotel and the hotel, even after showing them my confirmation and after they acknowledged through their office, refused to honor the reservation, put a deposit onto my card (as sated by the hotel clerk).  The problem was that the deposit was instead a charge and equaled the cost of the room.  No wonder the guy upgrade my room free of charge for my inconvenience.  The following week was spent doing several phone calls, getting false promises without results.  The corporate office is impossible to reach.  CLEANLINESS:  the lobby is absolutely filthy and the lobby and hallways are filled with marijuana scent—very unpleasant. The room was clean, but the toilet didn’t flush.  The elevators were dirty and stunk horrible.  FOOD:  Clerk said they don’t have room service or dining due to COVID and pointed to a vending machine that sold candy bars.  The Starbucks in the lobby was closed and may have had food.  SHUTTLE:  The shuttles run to airport every 15 mins, however the drivers allow for overcrowding and definitely put you at risk for COVID.  Never again will I stay at any Sheraton hotels.< /Review>

THIS HOTEL IS LIT! Lots of fun visitors around... makes for good people watching. The staff are epic and some of the nicest folks. Got upgraded in a major way to an Executive King Suite. Great deals on Priceline but it’s worth the cost, regardless. BOOK HERE. (ps, $17 daily parking in the back up Avión!)</Text>

Positive: Not happy with stay at all.  Lot of noise in the hall ways as well as service was bad with maintenance. Negative: The rooms TV didn't work when I first got there, and the phone as well, it took maintenance 1 hour and 30 minutes to come, and even after that the phone still never worked. I had to call from my cell phone to let front desk no that there was still issues< /text>

<text>Got a great deal online!

Very nice rooms with a great view.
We had a view facing north so we got to see the airplanes land.

The pool was not in service so we had to use Crown Plazas pool which was not all that..

Guest Services / Front Desk was excellent.
And everyone at the Hotel gave such a warm welcoming greeting whenever my son and I would walk by.

The Housekeeping on the other hand was a bit rude. Spoke to me in Spanish when obviously I'm asian and expected me to understand what she was saying, as soon as I tried talking to her in English she quickly announced " No English".
That incident was disappointing.

Other than that, I enjoyed this hotel.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0WB1fn6tvre5VCG_tBCb2UN9qQfqm73Q0N40Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe0NvnuHAjt2Ee5v-XFtOrs8Mgu06tB6R1uMXv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRRMWgLWjRR_Bv9MSbOSjn3JN6ejGOFsleCe5s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI-u5aOde4mk9KfYn7WJkOR5qd2UGVYvmoH_mc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7xm36rgS8JyzZKtE5UffBZoYseKglyXlPyPO_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiEbq6TwNVYVqo7oH-izYDzbMEggUurnhCs-4g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4DbkCyIl57YmVOKduqWN_49ImVYvob5cSMI7b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1583245075424, 'text': 'Pauline, thank you for your review.

<Text>The website says parking and there was no parking on site. It does not state that you have to pay and if the lot is full on site which is probably only 50ish spots. There's an offsite parking which is a block or so away that you pay for. Also, not stated on the website. After we walked across the street from the offsite parking, with all of our luggage, we were approached by several individuals that were trying to gain our attention. The hotel offered no security outside the hotel. So that was not a great start to our stay. Then when we were leaving the hotel, we got stuck in the elevator on the 14th floor! This was a very disappointing stay. We have stayed at Sheraton Hotels because we enjoy the environment. This was not a pleasant stay.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>Positive: The staff were exceptional, upgrading us to an even nicer room. The room and the hotel were lovely. Negative: Parking was overpriced, at $50. I ended up parking at a nearby hotel and walking with my bags a block, so that I only paid $20. I feel that parking should be included with the room.</text>< Pictures>

Not sure what the menu looked like for in-room dining.     Self park wasn't close to the hotel. 3 sets of doors on the side of the hotel that looked like you could enter weren't open.     Didn't change out tissue box.<//Text>< Rating>

Positive: I goofed when booking and had the wrong date. Management okayed me coming the day I intended. You really can't beat that! Loved the reflective bits in the wallpaper, catching the sunset. Really nice room. Negative: Nope!<//review>

A very classy hotel with lots of style..... meet new people---hang in the bar, poolside, in the lobby or even Starbucks. So many options then just being in your room. The food is good, so enjoy!< /text>

< review>
I've been there before. Property cleanliness is okay not as good asother Hilton group of hotels.

Later on I Booked through Expedia, a non refundable booking, I had an emergency and couldn't get there.

Called the  hotel front desk and ans they referred me back to to Expedia.

I called Expedia and they contacted the hotel to ask them to wave the cancellation fees (the full amount of money for booking in this case) the hotel refused to wave the cancellation fee and said that they were holding the room for me from other customers.

Can you believe it, it is covid-19 time reservation date is March 14 till March 15 happens to be on Sunday and the hotel claims that the lost money because they were "holding" the room for me.< /review>

This place is perfect. The lobby and staff are both extremely inviting and accommodating. The rooms are the perfect size- very clean and very up dated. They have complementary wine in the lobby. Beds are super comfy and I really dig the vibe.< /Text>

This is a family-friendly hotel! My kids loved this place every time we are here and they had so much fun at the pool. Their sandwiches at their restaurant were the best tasting sandwiches we ever tasted. The rooms were very clean and tidy. It has the coziest and best mattresses in all the hotels we had in the past.<//review>

<Review>Great hotel.
My family & I had a wonderful stay.
"THE LINK" is the name for their "business center". Nice spot in the lobby. Didn't care for it being close to the bar for my 7 year old.
Overall we had a good stay. Bellmen where friendly, too.

The room service robot was something totally new to me.
They place your snacks in the top of the robot (a lid) and it wheels itself to your door. That was very different.<//Review><Rating>4< /Rating><user>100481767075607969988< /user></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Visited for the first time, the staff was friendly and the rooms weren't bad.

Cons: I arrived with my family late night and the smell of weed and cigar was strong right outside.
If I pay $100+ for a room, I would assume the parking would be included.
The parking right in front the hotel was $33. There aren't many parking right in front the hotel. I mean, its a BIG hotel. There is an overflow parking lot behind the hotel.
I'd think those parking spots are at least included with the rooms. Nope!
If you go in and out, it's just over $2. If you stay there over night and not go out, expect to pay around $18.
I've stayed at other places that are smaller and better. I'd picked those ones over this hotel</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</Gmap_id></record>

<review>Right next to LAX airport. Very nice hotel, really nice rooms with good LG TV's. Because of my Titanium status I was immediately upgraded to an upper tier room on the concierge level which is in the 15th floor. Concierge lounge is 24/7 access and has one of those awesome cappuccino/latte/mocha/coffee makers.
I'll let my pictures tell the rest.< /review>< Pictures>

< review>
This hotel is extremely greedy for money. I didn’t get to stay at the hotel because of the shut down due to covid-19 restrictions. I called to cancel the reservation within 24 hours and they said they would work with me to see what my options would be. They Ended up overcharging me (more than the initial charge) and never got back to me about a refund for the original charge. I am still working to get this resolved after a month.< /review>

<review>The hotel is clean and new. The only thing bothered me a lot was people smoke pot right in front of the entrance doors. They should have assigned an area for smoking. It was really annoying smelling it in and out.<//review>< user>

The hotel is old (as are most in SF) but the rooms were nice with new-ish looking furniture and decor, and we barely heard any neighbors from our 6th floor executive king room.  What we did hear was a ton of street noise from Kearny/Sutter, even with ear plugs, so I will definitely ask for an inside room if we return.< /Text>

The entire facility seemed more like just a hotel rather than "The Sheraton." We believed booking The Sheraton would mean absolute contentment but now we have switched our default hotel chain. The front desk agent made us sign a document stating the parking fees are going up on future visits. That just made us realize we will not be ever staying there again.</Text>

<text>The staff at the Sheraton were great. The main issues were that the rooms are interconnected to other rooms with locked doors, meaning that sound easily travels through into your room. Our neighbors were literally screaming next door as we were trying to go to sleep early for our early morning flight. Just keep it in mind.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>This hotel overcharged me almost $100 and doing everything to try not to give me my refund. They said i checked in with an additional 2 guests which wasnot true because i went there alone but they keep insist on that i go there with 5 peoples. what happened is that they overcharged me on NOV 25, i checked in at the hotel on DEC 22, how could they foresee im gonna checked in with 2 more guests. They charged me for 2 ghosts 1 month before i even showed up. Is that make sense?</Review>< pictures>

The rooms are big and modern but you can hear the planes at LAX. The shower are nice as well just low water pressure. The food at Sheraton is really good. The only con was when we checked in the hotel on our floor had cigarettes smell but it was gone the second night. Overall it's a really nice hotel and big with great customer service.  I will recommend it and definitely will stay there again.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYnt7aJFHA9MaZQbtxeeOf34UUv3UBIdY46CmH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAdanuUlx7xdU8w35F3uB2O6K2qsvTZwL5qm4o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJjc370pyC-Hcz7iP8kkm7FSYTX9U5cVpOKgqc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7KYdPJM_TPtpWhY_voNnvDL3xvb9XtQUI9MIZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy8Oibz-orAY8ROLni7VrJmx2npMt-n2EFUxrf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipML4Mk8NtTXvwMt8a9fS2wopYX6NYfpkJm_5niB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

<text>Positive: Location to airport but that is it Negative: I have stayed at this hotel multiple times in the last couple of years, but this is the last time. My hotel room was subpar with torn carpet and no soap.  The van driver to the airport the next morning was extremely rude, I will take my business elsewhere</text>< Pics>

<Review>Good:  offer club lounge, location (very close to airport), microwave available, shuttle bus to LAX airport,
Opportunities for improvement:
1.  Breakfast food selection at club lounge (can really add some more selection),
2.  Associates at checkout counters in the morning (the date I left 630am, there were 4 customers tried to checkout, but only one customer service agent/associate).  People were in a hurry to go airport, and don't have time to wait.
3.  Rooms are old, need update.  It also show a lot of wear and tear.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>We booked two nights through Tablet Hotel and received a few additional perks for being Tablet Plus members. The only Hotel we didn't get automatically was the discounted parking but they resolved that during checkout once I reminded them. Kudos to Tablet for also confirming the additional amenities before we arrived as well.<//text>< name>

The moment we entered the hotel, the security staff and front desk were extremely accommodating. The ambiance at the lobby was comforting. I was surprised by the birthday cake that was made out of bath towels when we entered our room.  It was creative and thoughtful of them. The staff was punctual when we asked for assistance to connect to the hotel wifi. I strongly recommend staying here!< /text>

<Review>Nice hotel. Clean and updated. The concierge lounge very basic. Was upgraded to a large corner suite. Free shuttle to and from LAX. Gym is well equipped with cardio and combination of free weights and cable machines. Nice pool and hot tub outside. Private area. Front desk was helpful and quick to check me in.big bar and restaurant on 1st floor. Large diverse menu to meet most dietary needs, including vegetarian and gluten friendly. Overall nice hotel very close to LAX.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsjMyJN26HMXwvsgJjFh1XVPWP8L44sgpWA4Xz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrf6YAUOggOzZGd9qeC7e0ItHPKeWYLWaAp2c_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

<text>The best hotel in town! Truly comforts of your home while away. It is our usual holiday to spend on the beach. Not this time. We spend our holidays here in the hotel, as my friend referred to me. I am glad we did because the place was amazing. The kids love it. And the staff was very accommodating and hospitable. We surely come back here again for a future stay. The best!</text></record>

Don't get deceived because of the 4-star hotel brand. The room & view look good, but the service is at the bottom. We went to a room with a coffee dispenser & coffee bags, but no drinking water provided. We called for 30 mins and no one picked up the phone. At the end of the first day, the hot shower water ran out, and they promised to have hot water again in 30 mins, but we didn't get that until the last day we were there. Literally a terrible customer service, with negligent & rude staff. Will go to somewhere else with a better service next time we're in LA.< /Text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>The worst Sheraton hotel I have been into! They will charge you $50 each night for parking. Also, there is almost nothing in the rooms, I mean it is worse and the hostels!! No pen or notepad, just one towel, .... You need to call for all the necessities which were supposed to be in the room already! The last issue which was shocking was hairs on the pillowcases, I mean of course they changed it after I asked to, but come on this Sheraton if I wanted to deal with this I would go to Days Inn!</text>< Pics>

Everyone from this hotel are pleasant and helpful from the security to the concierge, the receptionists, housekeeping, and restaurant staff. Everyone made us feel so welcome. Although the hotel was very busy and full of guests in the lobby we managed to check-in and out with ease and staff were still smiling. Our room was clean, bed, and pillows are so comfortable! I strongly recommend staying here!<//Review>

Beautiful Hotel. The room was extremely clean, smelled nice and the beds were very comfortable.  The lobby was beautifully decorated for Chinese New Year when we stayed, and the restaurant was nice to eat at. It was too cold for our taste to check out the pool, but it looked lovely. The concierge was very polite and helpful, both with checking in and in checking out. The shuttle was prompt and the staff were helpful and courteous. All in all, a wonderful stay!< /Review>

I like the mattress, I usually can never sleep in hotels but this was a very comfortable beauty rest they had. Everything was very clean I only think the carpet should be cleaned more often.</Review>

Positive: The location was good and near public transportation. Negative: It was a bit of a surprise that this hotel charges an additional $75 deposit PER NIGHT. I covered it of course through my credit card but this was the first time I was ever charged a per night deposit.</text>

<rate>2</rate><text>Great price! However, hotel seems like a “weekend hangout spot”. Very noisy, guests partying at night no hotel staff available. Rooms and every floor smell like smoke even though it’s “non-smoking”. If you park at the hotel it’s $50, if you park in the back lot it’s $17 and they charge you every time you leave and re-enter.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>The staff is very patient and kind i booked my room threw Hotels.com and after I was charged they canceled my reservation due to a mistake on there part it took them 4 hours to refund me so I could get the room I booked when I talked to c.s. they could not rebook my room. But the staff at the hotel didn't rush me or treat me poorly. During this embarrassing, shameful process.  I ended up getting room and enjoyed my hotel stay GREAT PLACE TO STAY< /text>< Pics>

This hotel is located in a strategic zone of LA. The beds are comfortable and the room space is spacious. There is not enough parking and you have to pay valet parkig. If you go on a rest plan, notify in service desk during your check in because of the proximity to the airport, guests with early flights, set their alarms and be heard throughout the others rooms so, you can not Rest enought. The service was kind. You can go with family.<//Review>

As per the hotel staff two separate reservations were made and we had to checked out after the first night of our stay and check back in and go through the check in process all over again. It so happened My husband lost his wallet the next day and he didn’t have his ID this was an added inconvenience to our day.<//Text>

<Text>So sad to leave california but for the price of staying here it was worth it. Pros: housekeeping does their job and are helpful at filling any requests. No bed bugs. Room service surpurb. Pool and cabana area is beautiful. The downstairs bar and restaurant open until 12 midnight every night and is reasonably priced. Llendy checked me in and out at the front desk and gave me alot of hot cali attractions to check out on my stay here. Accessible to catch any lyft. Extremely close to the airport you have to be an idiot to miss your flight being this close. Free airport shuttle. Cons: low water pressure im from east coast and need a powerful shower at night before bed. Pricing at certain times of year.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcsnJ3aDnl5fkzUuGlQzQrsZKoi9vyVTbingtX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfZDRrxMcm29thpksOB-9YHf1dPS8XkWTy3cEn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWIrEr-rSBsWQ-m5TPboSFlLBG6QOZxfzxDal0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCqXRFB3zDvGhOn9QymLg7inKU_NCM2Jg7UboE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1555427130816, 'text': "Thank you for your positive feedback, Shaniece!

This hotel was extremely noisy we didn’t get much sleep between the slamming doors and talking in the hall that went on most of the night. We couldn’t call out on our phone to the front desk or for room service. I felt we should have had a refund or a credit. The manager offered me a cup of coffee! He said he would give the director my number and they would call me. I never heard from them. Place smells like a weed factory on top of it. For the price it fell far short a good experience!< /Text>

< review>
Never before, have I arrived at a hotel and felt so confused as to what to do. Due to COVID - valet parking was closed. There were cars parked on all sides of the hotel, behind the hotel and even in spots that were reserved. The traffic of cars coming in, made the entrance so clustered. We were told to park anywhere - but luckily someone came out of a spot and I was able to park. Once I got to the room, I went into the bathroom to take a shower, and the water pressure was very low. To make matters worse, I woke up the following morning to get something from my car, and there were 2 tow trucks outside. I asked someone what was happening, and he told me that they were towing cars who didn't pay for a parking permit. At no point during check-in did they tell us we had to pay for a permit to park!! So 1 hour before checking out, I had to pay $33 for a permit to prevent my car from being towed. I return upstairs to shower before leaving for the airport and there's no hot water - none! I will never stay at the Sheraton in LAS again. I was beyond disappointed with my experience in that hotel.< /review>

<Text>Amazing hotel! I absolutely adored every aspect the hotel had to offer, breakfast had a wide variety range to choose from, with the eggs locally sourced, which is nice to see smaller local businesses also being included. I really enjoyed my stay here. I wanna thank the staff who accommodated me during my stay here for she's very helpful and nice to talk with.</Text>< pictures>

Positive: The lobby was very clean and fast service. Negative: Parking was not explained before booking. Itâ€™s $17 per day and the location of the parking garage is at a long distance from the hotel. If you want to park in front itâ€™s $50 per day. Also, the TVs are very very outdated.</review>

Brilliant hotel to break a flight or hang out before or after a flight

Very close to LAX and our preferred hotel to stop at with kids. Clean and recently renovated this hotel has a great pool and hot tub.

The service was some of the best we have had in the USA!<//review>

We were instantly greeted by the doormen who assisted us in getting our things up to the room. The huge marble columns and glass front doors give this place an upscale, classy vibe. Once in the door we looked up to the tall ceilings and beautiful decor of the lobby. We were checked In and up to our room with in minutes. The elevators are easy to access. Must use key card at night to access guest rooms from elevator. Now beware to the room number as the signs are misleading and you will end up on the other side as we did. The room had an amazingly fresh clean smell when we opened the door. We had a king size bed with a couch as well. We had a pretty cool view of the city and was able to catch a few planes landing. The room was very clean and stocked with the necessities. Huge tv and coffee maker. But let's talk bathroom. Very contemporary decor but I love it. Stand up shower only with full glass doors. Super hot water and awesome shower head!! Bed was the most comfortable ever and made me sad to leave. My only negatives about here is that housekeeping is a bit intrusive as they entered our room several times both days, even when we had our sign up and told them we didnt need it. The other issue is that they charged us 12.00 for a bottle water when we only drank one at 6.00 a piece. The concierge was very helpful as were the front desk ladies. The gift shop is moderately priced and has quite a bit to look over. The restaurant is spectacular and I recommend the egg rolls!! Theres also a Starbucks inside which I only seen open once. They do have great baristas and great coffee. The pool was being renovated so we were offered acess to a hotel pool near by but we didn't use it. The hotel is right next to LAX in a great location. Busy busy place but if your traveling for leisure, business, or a weekend getaway, this is the place for sure.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I have stayed here in many occasions when I visit LA especially for layovers through LAX.  Ive always felt that this property is of good value and quality.  A lot has changed from my last visit 6 years ago and not for the better.

I was supposed to stay in LA for 3 days but decided to leave after one night.  I should have listened to some of the reviews here.

The moment I walked in the lobby, I already sensed a different vibe.  The moment I walked in the elevators, I smelled smoke and weed combined with chemical neutralizers to mask the scent.  it was strong and horrible.  I should have checked out right away but I was so tired from my international flight that I decided to proceed to my room.  The room had a smell but not as strong as the elevators.   However when you go to the bathroom where the main vents are, you will strongly smell it.  I had to close my bathroom door all the time and not breathe when im in the bathroom to avoid this.  Anyone who is health conscious should take this property off your list.

I tried to venture out to get some food and there were just creepy, shady and questionable characters roaming around.  When I walked in the elevator a woman had a portable electric stove and a small appliance and she told me she is moving in for awhile.  Long story short, this property has taken in needy groups of people who may need housing during this pandemic.  I applaud them for doing so.  I am all for helping the needy especially in this time of need.  However, guests like me deserve full disclosure.  I asked them before I checked in if this is true and they vehemently denied it.  That is an outright lie.  I am not appalled at their charitable actions, I am vehemently against their total disregard for paying guests to know what experience they may have to go through during their stay.  Im sure some guests are ok with it but some may not.  My biggest problem is the smell of smoke and weed that I have to inhale even in my room.  This is unacceptable especially for a non smoking hotel.  Please dont tell me that you fine guests who smoke in your room when these smokers are the homeless people who will not be able to afford paying the room let alone the smoking fine.  If this property wants to be a homeless shelter that is wonderful, I might even send some contribution to help but you cannot be both.  It is not fair for regular paying guests.

the one star is for the service I received from the lady in the front desk and the cleaning staff who really provide wonderful service despite the environment they are in.

The shuttle takes forever btw, I had to wait almost 30 mins before it arrived.  They had to call it and ask whats going on.  If you need something and you dial 0 from the room, you will either not get a response unless you have the patience to wait a very long time.

I understand that we are in a different world.  However, we cannot use this as an excuse to provide poor quality and expect guests to pay the same price.  There should be a balance in all this.  Sadly, I don't think I will be back in this property again.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><name>AlexisRF F<//name>< UserId.>

Had a wonderful stay here with my wife for our 14 year anniversary. The room was clean and the amenities were luxurious for an affordable price on expedia.com. Will definitely return for another stay as the beach and Hollywood are nearby.</text>

I stayed with my family and friends I have reserved three rooms for one night. The building is nice and Clean but basics things not available. The agent on customer service are terrible and have some attitude issues, especially the one who answering the guest service.
Hotel with this name is out of sugar and creamers !!! Or doesn’t have a microwave. when you call room service you have to wait 45 to an hour to be answered and  they show you an attitude. It was so frustrating for me and my family and I didn’t have a good impression on this place . this is the first time and last time to reserve in this hotel, yes the manager came and solve the issue. But having people of the front desk with attitude is not nice to service guests.< /text><user_name>Naji “naji alrashed” Alrashed<//user_name>< Rate>

Excellent.  A must stay when in LA. The Sheraton Gateway at the LAX Century Blvd.-Strip has been completely re-done. Top designers. All brand new. Including sleep enhancing healthy beds.
Best place to be away from home and to get the first true  feeling  of being a  Hollywood star. For every taste is something.  Quiet reading in a generously spread out lobby with comfortable seating, couches and tables everywhere.
Rooftop...private club....panorama view.
Top restaurant, top food at affordable prices.
Huge modern lobby bar: Under a super high ceiling held in light colors you'll run into people from all over the world and locals alike from all walks of life.  Relaxing at a beautiful quiet pool outside looking at the ever blue sky in Southern California lined with majestic  palm trees next to the stars in heaven... and much more.
Last but not least a dynamite staff that pampers you rounds the picture to a perfect circle.
PS: Better pictures are coming soon. What would you like to see?</Text>

<Text>I reserved a room for my son as it’s his first time visiting this city. He waited for almost 2 hours to obtain good room key! The room was paid for and we provided the night manager, Carmen all the information she requested. My son finally gets to the room to find it was not ready! A mattress from one bed was stacked onto another bed, used condoms and condom wrappers on the floor!!   My son checked out and went elsewhere. I am highly disappointed in the service and the condition of the room they expected my son to stay in!! I hope to receive a full refund back on my card within 24 hours!! I will also be taking this above the night manager’s supervisor!!</Text><Resp>None< /Resp><name>Janie Paulson< /name>< gmap_id>

While my room was nice and every staff member I interacted with was friendly and helpful, this hotel was much too crowded. Their pool is closed due to covid but that doesn't say much for the precautions they're taking during this pandemic because there are long lines of people waiting to pack into the only functioning elevator like sardines. It took ten minutes just to get on an elevator and  if I hadn't gotten on with 10 other people (elevator max capacity 3) it would've taken so much longer. Because of this and the god awful and terribly expensive parking I will not be staying again.< /review>

<Date>1606108936379< /Date><rating>1</rating><Review>This review isn't about stay but an experience even before the stay.  I made a reservation for myself, my bother, nephew and niece for the coming Thanksgiving week on 24th and 25th, I made this reservation though Expedia. But since we booked in last two weeks Covid cases have peaked and Govt of California have imposed a curfew and thus family got a little scared of travelling. We had plan to be in LA for two nights and followed by Venture and Pismo on our way back to bay area.

The hotel staff including GM have been rude, uncourteous and inconsiderate of my booking cancelation. I also felt that no one had intentions to listen or appreciate the new surfaced facts, answers from staff  were inconsistent too, one girl named Jennifer told she doesn't want to get fired by cancelling my reservation, another girl told me that as you have reached out to GM, which I did based on advise from the first girl, she won't cancel my reservation and have GM decide. Which to me appeared as if I did something wrong by reaching out to Gm with a humble note or request. End of the story GM called Philip Dailey sends me a cold email without even caring to call, with a sarcasm that he would like to handle all future reservations himself personally.

This experience completely altered by brand relationship with Marriot and Sheraton for rest of  my lifetime, and realized how demeaning the staff training and concepts like moments of truth have become over a period of time, and probably one must do due diligence of leadership behind these hotel properties. As values such as respect and empathy trickles down from top, based on how their staff is been treated and trained.

After the fact I checked their reviews and realized they have many bad reviews which they do not care about much. I have lost a small amount of $364.38 but please think twice before booking with this hotel.</Review>< Pics>

As soon as we got there we noticed that there were dirty towels in our bathroom. One of the towels under the sink it was so crusty we knew it had been there a while. They offered to upgrade our room but during this pandemic you don’t have room for error. We just try to get out for the day and enjoy ourselves in a room. Next time I’ll just stay home Because if they’re not going to clean exceptionally well then I might as well stay in my own home.</text>

Our daughter was bitten during a nap on the bed. Never left the room. Rooms not cleaned & amenities weren’t stocked upon arrival. We stayed here 8/9- 8/11...they took pictures of the bites changed rooms but nothing else was done to accommodate us. ****$33/night parking fee **** beware! No free parking, the alternative suggested by staff is to park at the airport and walk back to the hotel. The airport charges Everytime you move your car out of the lot. Our previous bad reviews were previously removed. The good reviews are paid for BEWARE!!!< /Review>

Great hotel with hard-working staff. However, there is no food or drinks at the executive club at 530pm. If they don't improve the club drinks and food in the evening then it's not worth the extra charge. I highly recommend this hotel however not the lounge club unless they improve the food and beverage options. Normally in a club, you get complimentary drinks during the day and evening. Nothing in this club during the day or evening. Only Tea, Coffee, Soft drinks and water. Fruit and chips. I have no idea how you would eat a whole organgr< /review>

After many years this is still a special restaurant to celebrate an event or a special evening. The main dining room remains formal, the food is exquisite, and the service is still astounding with just the right combination of thoughtful and well-trained staff. We have enjoyed many milestones here, and it is definitely worth the try!<//Text>

what a place. i found the Sheraton Hotel amazing. really nice and helpful staff. as we pulled up outside it was an instant nice feeling. the lobby looks very impresive this was a patern that followed through out the entire building. very nice bar with lots of indoor seating and a lovely garden with a pool. hot tub and more seating. even private little tent style areas with seating. toilets never far. starbucks on ground floor as you walk in. sadly this closes quite early think it closed at 6pm. but tea and coffee also available at the bar. lots and lots of rooms. our last night there was a private wedding party on in the function room. the room itself upstairs was quite awesome. very nicely decorated with two queen beds. sofa. tv. fridge. safe. toilet and bathroom. extremely comfy bed. had two great nights of sleep. a very stylish modern catered for all hotel in a super location close to LAX. we went for a walk around the area but not alot. just many different hotels and a mc donalds a couple of blocks away. couldnt fault this hotel at all. it was one of the nicest hotels i have ever stayed in. maybe im not high enough up the ladder of life yet but i felt like a million dollars here.

<text>We travel and stay here often as Elite Bonvoy members. I want to give a shout out to Terry at the bar. Terry is impressive, professional, and focused on delivering excellent service. He deserves recognition as he clearly sets an example of how each customer should be treated and served. Please consider Terry as a trainer if he already doesn't serve in this capacity. He sets the bar high! We will be back due to your great hires.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1583591009131, 'text': 'Thank you for the five-stars, and we are excited to pass along your compliments to Terry!

At check-in, I was told the gym was closed due to L.A. County rules which turned out to be a lie.   Other hotels nearby have open gyms.  I guess it is easier to lie to guests and blame the county than to say it was closed by choice.    Also, the pool is closed but the pool at the Marriott down the street is open.   Hotel food venues all closed.    Bonvoy lounge closed.   There comes a point where the hotel is just saving money and using Covid as an excuse.<//Text>

What a great hotel! Best hotel I've been in by far. So clean and the service was friendly. Rooms were big and very comfortable. The location and access to the airport was very convenient. I just didn't like that parking was $17 a day. Get a pass so you can go in and out for 24 hrs instead of paying each time you go out of the lot. You'll save quite a bit.< /Text>

I haven’t even stayed here yet but I have a receipt online in my email for the amount I was supposed to be charged and have contacted them for my 40$ difference but I keep getting told to wait. The third party I went through its been 3 weeks so I wanted to cancel with a full refund now they are trying to give me my difference but it’s to late bad customer service<//Review>< gmapID>

<review>Skelton staff and closed restaurant... had to walk to Hilton two blocks down to get hot meal. Their lobby Starbucks was open limited hours and also under-staffed. The businesses center had broken copier and I also had to go to Hilton for service. Finally, they had a large group of unruly guests and foul language used often including a fight in Sheraton parking lot. Won’t stay here again.< /review>< pictures>

Very nice rooms staff was friendly but didn't seem to know the cpu systems or something alot of complications and confusion about checking in. They gave the wrong info and that was multiple staff members. Also the hours of the gift shop and very short and the door was locked although it said open when I attempted to go in the first time. The Starbucks inside was also not great. They had one employee working the open shift and he didn't even make my drinks right. A shame.< /text>

My family and I had a great stay at the Sheraton. The staff was very nice and attentive. Anytime I called guest services they brought someone up right away to help. Our room was clean and spacious. Bathrooms were also spacious and had a great shower. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Parking rates are high but that is expected.</Review>

First time staying at Sheraton Gateway.  I was very impress from meeting the check-in staff.  They made you feel like an old friend whom they had not seen in awhile.  The hotel is beautiful in structure and personality.  This hotel aims to overwhelm their customers with comfort and an unforgettable experience.  It's location is excellent; a few minutes from LAX and free 24/7 airport shuttle.  In my opinion, mission accomplished.< /Review>

<date>1583366400000</date><rate>None< /rate><text>I've stayed at a lot of airport hotels (3 on this one business trip alone) and this definitely feels like an airport hotel. Even though it's a Sheraton, don't expect anything super fancy. You're getting a good, clean room with good service, but you're not getting fancy bells and whistles. You can also tell this hotel is a bit dated if you care about that sort of thing. 

Pros: (1) Close to the airport (2) Free shuttle will have you there in <5 min and runs frequently (3) King room was very large (4) Lots of outlets in the room (5) (Mostly) Friendly staff (see below) (6) Gym is large - lots of equipment options and also provides mats & foam rollers 

Cons: (1) Lobby is kind of small - don't expect a quiet place to work if you need to as everyone is hanging out in the lobby (2) Elevators are SUPER SLOW - I think only 2 out of the 5 were working so lines would be 12-15 deep waiting for elevator (3) When this was brought to an employee's attention, there was no attempt to remedy the situation - employee was very rude (rest of staff was very attentive) (4) Bar dining area service is slow - I gave up trying to dine here</text>< Pictures>

great room with nice view of LAX.
bed was very comfortable.
check in was quick and easy.
had to pay for parking, but that is typical for LAX hotels.
shuttle runs every 15 minutes 24/7   which is great for flights arriving late night.<//Text>

<Text>Great hotel in good location for overnight stay at LAX. Close to rental car drop offs. Close to food and Target. Culver City Mall is 10 mins by Uber. Theres a great Greek restaurant around the corner. We are in the Bar/Restaurant and the food was pretty good. We stuck to the club. sandwich and Cobb Salad. Waiting for Elevator was a bit slow but there was a Rams game that evening. I liked that the coffee table could be removed from the couch to make that an additional bed. Nice spot. No complaints.</Text></record>

<rating>None< /rating><Text>I chose this hotel due to location and the convenience of the 24h shuttle to the airport, which worked very well both ways. I stayed for a mere 7h at the hotel, checked in at night and had a very early flight. Spacious room, super comfy bed! But got a noisy room, with a connecting door to the neighboring room. And the proximity to the airport makes that the airplane taking off is also heard. But with earplugs, I had a good sleep! And again, the bed was amazing!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Stayed here when I've missed my flight. Great customer service. Stayed on 11th floor with the view of the airport runway. Bed is very comfortable slept really good even with the sound of planes taking off. Pro: I can watched and hear planes taking off. Con: I can hear planes taking off.< /Text>

It is just a few min. from LAX. A shuttle met me almost immediately of arriving at the curb. As to food service; the concierge lounge is less than optimal. The choices are poor, especially during the evening. In addition there is no drink service in the evening. The gentleman that works there is very efficient. The restaurant downstairs smell so cigarette  smoke and the service is not great, but the food is fresh and tasty.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Name>

The hotel is nice. The rooms are very nice and spacious. The service is definitely not in sync with the building. Non-attentive waiters. You are alone most of time looking around for someone to ask for whatever you need. You see them hanging around on the back chatting. A valet leaning on the reception counter cracking jokes loudly while customers are checking in. I am not talking about a 1 am check-in but at 7:30 pm on a Saturday. Total lack of seriousness. Also they changed the tip on a dinner check. It was wrongly calculated but in these cases you tell the customer, you don't just go and put whatever you want. It is probably illegal, too.< /Text>

The best full-service hotel within walking distance of LAX. Beautifully modernized rooms & bathrooms. Staff is kind & professional. Club lounge is nice added benefit but food wasn't extraordinary. I'll choose this property for my next stay near LAX.<//review>

<Review>I was visiting LA with my son to look at colleges. We had a great stay. Our room and the beds were clean and comfortable. We had an excellent breakfast with a friendly, attentive wait staff. The lobby, which was decorated beautifully for the holidays, had areas of quiet so that I could make work related phone calls. I would recommend this hotel and I would stay there again.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Time>

<text>I was very pleased with the hotel. I was there with my family (including young children) for a business conference. The staff was very accommodating, the food was good, and the hotel felt clean. My kids enjoyed the pool. My only issue was that in the club lounge there was a lot of pork served during our stay. We don't eat pork. I would have been nice to have more options. But overall, great experience.</text>< Pics>

It is really close to the airport and the shuttle service is great.  You can track the shuttles in the Marriott app... how cool is that!  The food at the bar is actually fantastic!  Prices are pretty fair too.  I’d stay here every time.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>My stay at this hotel was overall good.    The staff was very friendly and the facility itself clean and inviting.  While there I attended a convention for 3 days.  Comfortable chairs were provided and the venue itself quite nice with bathrooms close by.  Overall great experience.  The elevators were beyond slow which was surprising for a hotel the caters to large groups of people.  Parking your car overnight is $50 even as a paying guest.  The internet is beyond slow again surprising for a hotel that is supposed to be catering to large numbers of guests.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My room was comfortable, enough room to move around. Big bonus: the conference room wasn't freezing cold like in so many hotels. All the staff were kind and friendly. The food at the bar and in the restaurant was delicious and properly prepared.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6nWMnCyc4E7ZETU81qND8v8OWQOZw25DDtL8S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Whole hotel had no hot water for about 8 or 9 hours. Talk to the manager on checkout she was rude unapologetic and dismissive. Quite frankly it's pathetic customer service. Shows how valued I was as a customer staying there whenever transiting through LAX. Time to find a new regular hotel.< /Review>

Great spot. Has a nice gift shop. Starbucks. Full service bar. Nice breakfast buffet. Good gym. Clean well maintained pool and spa. Restaurant and bar seating flows into the outdoor patio around the pool which is a nice bonus! Lots of comfortable sofas and things. Gym is nice. Has the cool robot to bring you small requested items. Their renovation was well done and doesn’t feel cheap. The club offers multiple semi private seating areas each with their own tv; akin to a Ritz or St Regis club. Recommend this hotel.<//review>

< Review>
Came to town on personal business. Upgraded to executive suite which had a nice view of the pool and space to relax on a grey velvet like couch. Updated room and bathroom with modern design. Water a bit sulfury. But cannot be more pleased about the exceptional service - missing toiletries? Guest services handled it. They even have a robot butler! Concierge Lounge had a lovely breakfast spread with yogurts, eggs, cereal, fruits, pastries and oatmeal. Not keto friendly but appreciated. Evening spread was enormous- stunning veggie platter, hot dishes- steak fajitas and chicken enchiladas, sandwiches, cheeses. Coffees, waters, and sodas all day with some pretzel type snacks. I loved the spaces in the lounge and tv nooks. Great spot to get work done and watch planes. Gym and pool area also splendid. Lots of cardio, weights, and circuit. A dip in the pool - heated- was well deserved. Cabanas make you feel far and away from your average airport hotel. Luggage scales in the lobby also a nice perk to ease the mind of overpackers. Shuttle service impeccable. 5 minute from hotel to southwest. Coming in - with traffic less than 15 from baggage claim. Outstanding and dependable service. 20-40 minutes from Westwood/ westside  depending on traffic. Making this my LAX hotel every time.</Review>

A great experience at Sheraton. Very spacious and clean rooms with comfortable beds. Helpful and efficient personnel. 
Functional public spaces and lobby. Decent options for eating and a Starbucks coffee for quick bites and coffee. 
It can be a bit noisy from the aircraft during the day but nothing too serious (this applies mainly in the open spaces of the hotel). Considering the LAX curfew during the night, you can get a peaceful sleep.< /Review>

< Review>
We were scheduled to sail on the Royal Princess on 3/7/20.  The cruise was cancelled.  Sheraton LAX was one of the hotel choices "non-Princess travel booked" passengers could try and get a room at.  We arrived at the hotel hungry, and tired (we had been at the pier for 9 hours awaiting our cruise). We called ahead for our room.  Arrived and check-in was a breeze.  The room was beautiful. The bed was comfortable (blessed rest).

The only reason for 4 stars is the restaurant at the hotel was meh... expensive as all get out. Mediocre food - it was cold when it got to the table.  Two of three meals served.  Had to chase down the third meal.  Couldn't get a glass of water to save your life!  Had to beg to get the bill.<//Review>

I really liked this hotel. The room was great and spacious. It is literally 5 mins away from LAX airport. The hotel is huge. Bar down stairs where u can eat. There are also fast food restaurants and pizza places with in walking distance of this hotel.</review>

Negative: There were quite a number of unmasked young people staying in the hotel. Since the posting of no more than 2 people per elevator was not seen by many, I had to get out of the elevator as they piled in on more than one occassion.</text>

< Review>
My stay at the Sheraton Gateway was one of the best I've had.  Their staff were wonderful, their room was very clean and comfortable.  Even the clock had the time right (considering time changed just a few days prior to my stay).  I pay attention to the details, and they did not disappoint.  I would come back and highly recommend it to anyone that asks for suggestions when they come to Los Angeles.<//Review>

Good rooms, good service, nice food, all you need and more than you expect from an airport hotel

Rooms are very comfortable and are well kept, very silent (important because of the constant air traffic from the airport nearby)<//review>

Very nice hotel. We had an early flight, but they had a room for us. We had to pay a little extra, but it came with the executive lounge. I didn’t mind because it was a great value for what we were going to get.

The rooms were spacious. The beds were a little hard, but I could be really picky because my bed at home is super soft and amazing. There was the normal stuff as well as a fridge.

The executive lounge was the best. Great view and we didn’t have to pay for breakfast, bottled water, coffee or snacks. It was such a great deal and I HIGHLY recommend upgrading to it. It’s also a nice place to get away, especially if you’re at a large conference and need some quiet space.< /Text>

<review>I recently stayed at this Sheraton for a team training.  From my very welcoming reception at the front desk, to the quality of my room, I was pleasantly surprised.  My room was very clean and I enjoyed the updated bathroom and remodeled shower.  The beds were quite comfortable and the bedding was a very good quality. 

Most surprising was the friendliness of the staff:  again, from the stellar front desk clerk Leah to staff members I bumped into in the hallway, all greeted me with a smile and worked to make my stay very pleasant.  My group also used the meeting room facilities and the room was set up very nicely with coffee, tea, water, and cloth-covered tables.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>After flying home we had to spend the night in LA due to weather. Looked for a reasonable priced hotel with an airport shuttle and found the Sheraton Gateway. We were extremely happy with the price, customer service, room comfort & cleanliness. We ate dinner & breakfast at the hotel. The food was delicious. All staff were attentive & professional.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>The hotel is quite nice. The room is spacious and clean. Although it's a bit odd with only 1 complimentary bottled water for 2 of us. It's a room with 2 very comfortable queen beds. Small refrigerator, safe deposit box, Starbucks coffee and Tazo tea. 
USB plugs in the room, free Wi-fi but unsecured though. Everything is good except the AC unit being sooooo noisy.</review>< response>

The pool area is a particular highlight and the staff stand-out for their attention to detail, friendliness and efforts to go the extra mile.

Key programmers broke during check-in, no alternative way to check-in, so forced us to leave and come back later.   Don't allow yourself to be put in a room by elevator or service rooms, very loud.    Convention impacts ability to get to rooms during their breaks.   Big eating area but very sparsely attended.

Great place to be near lax! Really good breakfast spot a couple blocks away from the airport was a very nice find as well. I was close enough to walk to dollar rent a car also, mostly to enjoy the great weather instead of using shuttles or uber.</review>

From check in to check out my experience was one of the best I've experienced so far, even comparing my all-inclusive experiences. Oscar and the entire front desk was prepared and ready to handle me along with 300 of my fellow associates that all checked in between that Monday and Tuesday and they did it with no conflict or confusion. I used to manage hotels and I must say the culture and environment the staff shared made my experience very delightful. I was checked in to a room with a tub but realized with my broken leg that I could risk hurting myself in a shower so immediately they found me a room with a tub with no resentment or hesitation. Usually when you ask to change rooms they get made and give your a horrible room just for inconveniencing them. But they didnt, even though I ask to speak with Oscar they manger didnt hesitate to say no problem I'll help you. she got me in a new room and even came up to help me with my bags to my new room. I thank that showed true leadership quality. She knew Oscar was busy with checking people in and she stepped in to show support so that they could continue to work effectively. KUDOS TO THE ENTIRE TEAM.. Of which they all look like they enjoy working together.< /text>

Positive: The location and how close it was to the airport.  The staff was patient and very friendly.  It was big. Negative: Parking is a rip off because there is absolutely no where to park.  The first room we had was leaking water and the toilet was not working properly.  It was very difficult getting towels.  Trash in the hallways pretty much the entire stay.< /Review>

Positive: Location to airport Negative: This is NOT a 4star hotel! There is people in the parking 24/7  drinking and smoking weed. One guys was next to our car throwing up, the parking lot was filthy and smelled like Urine. The pictures are very deceiving. Hallways carpets is stained.< /review>

Positive: Room well appointed Negative: The place was out of control.  Doors banging, people yelling, music blaring, lady singing for an hour while knocking wood as a beat for an hour at 3 am.  I am a heavy sleeper.  I own a cannabis company.  On the 8th floor I could smell MJ smoke all night.< /text>

<review>Our stay would have been perfect if we did not wake up in the middle of the night to the smell of skunk weed. Room clean, comfortable. Food is great and service is excellent minus the fact that guest services didn't care about enforcing their no smoking policy on our neighbors.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Nice place unless you have an allergy. They have chemical doused Down pillows & comforter. Asking in advance for a defeathered room won't get you one. Prepare to arrive at midnight & be Un-accommodated and sick.<//Text>

Not as hospitable and excellent as other hotels.   My guest left a clothing item in our hotel,  asked the front desk if they could mail it, and they said no.   Secondly,  before we arrived a neighboring patron smoked pot in their room and stunk the whole place up.  Would you assign anyone around that room until that was taken care of?  They mindlessly did.< /Text>

This hotel recognizes your hotel status and responds appropriately.  It was a nice change.  I was not disappointed.  The entire staff, from valet to front desk to conceriege   to room attendants were all polite and accommodating.  What a great property.  The lounge food was not very good.< /Text>

When I first arrived at the Sheraton to check in I did not expect the disaster that was coming to me. I go to check in and am not able to park my car for 5 minutes! The valet man was so rude telling me “I better remember not to park here”. I felt completely disrespected. He also proceeded to give us wrong information to check in, causing us to park far and lug our bags to check in. Then I checked out of one of my two rooms the next day and they checked me out of both. Then I go to my room the key doesn’t work, we waited 15 minutes and finally someone came up to help. When we entered our room it was a mess. It wasn’t cleaned and was just terrible. We called the front desk, and they continued to be rude. I went down to speak to the manager and all she had to say was sorry, nothing else. Save your money and stay somewhere much better for the price!</review>

Mel in Guest Services is fantastic! She is very kind and compassionate. I was feeling under the weather and she sent met complimentary tea and honey. It was a small gesture but meant a lot.

Upon arrival we were greeted by Valet and told we given instructions about parking. At registration we were greeted by Anthony who asked us about our visit. I mentioned it was my first time in Los Angeles and I was celebrating my birthday with my husband. He got excited and shared that he would upgrade my room, provide sheraton club access for breakfast and snacks, and include valet parking. It was a luxury experience that I have only felt when I leave the country and go to a resort. Everything was pretty much included. The pool was warm. The cabanas were a nice touch and the jacuzzi was so relaxing.  The lobby decorations were beautiful and the interior design throughout the hotel was gorgeous. This was the best hotel experience I have ever had in my life.</Review>

Cozy rooms! The hotel is not loud at all, given that’ it’s across from LAX. A lot of food options in the hotel and nearby too. Recommend becoming a member so you can check in on your phone, request items on the app and more. Staff was very friendly. 10/10 would stay here again!< /Review>

Everything’s fine. Shuttle bus came very soon as I waited at the shuttle bus stand as well as the way off to the airport. 
The only concern is that the water Of the shower is not big enough. 
Also when I checked in, I wasn’t told clearly about the deposit they would take from my fee together. And wasn’t clear about when I would get the money back.
Rest are all good!<//review>

< review>
My stay at this hotel was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had.  The staff members were extremely friendly and helpful from the valet attendants to the front desk personnel to housekeeping.  The hotel is posh, modern and clean. It is a lively hotel with friendly people and fun activities. I had dinner at the bar on the first night and the food was excellent.   The Club Lounge was an added bonus that enhances the experience of the stay.  If you are visiting LA, stay at this hotel.  I would recommend avoiding staying in the downtown area.  I initially booked a room at an expensive downtown hotel and changed to this hotel within 30 minutes of  checking in there (because I was so disappointed and disgusted with the original hotel).  The change in hotels was by far the best decision of my trip.  This hotel was twice the space for half the price and with staff who were amazingly friendly and helpful.   Stay here!</review>

Negative: The fact that even though I had bought a room for longer than a day the hotel parking was not free. Also the "deposit" for $75 every day I stay is rather excessive. Other than it was okay.</Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>On day one of our stay at this location i was told on several occasions the hotel did not have any deposit or additional fees other then that of the nightly rate and taxes that would be charged to my account.       Immediately upon checkin i was advised of a $33 parking fee per night which was not mentioned on the company’s website or upon using my AAA member discount. Which the receptionist made no mention of this and again when i called customer service to update the reservation this information was not relayed to me. She actually told me several times no additional fees would be charged upon checking in. I woke up the following day Unknowingly i was charged the $75 incidental fee. I immediately called customer service and spoke with someone else who informed me of what the charge was and she stated she filed a complaint on my behalf and that as soon as we checked out the fee would be immediately refunded. After check out i called again and was told it could take 3-10 business days for the $75 to be returned to my account. My daughter was biten in her sleep and woke up from her nap screaming on day two of our stay. Someone came to the room and Took pictures of her face. Stated that it wasnt bed bugs and could possibly be a mosquito bite (due to covid 19 my 1 year old did not leave the room or hotel unless absolutely necessary) from day 1-2 she did not leave the room. After the report was filed for her face being bit while taking a nap. We moved rooms and she was then able to leave to hotel. Terrible communication between hotel staff. You get different information from everyone here. The only person who has made me feel at ease was the woman taking our report and photos of my babys face. I will Never stay here again! I am intending on reaching out to the Better Business Bureau!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</Gmap_id></record>

<rating>None</rating><Text>I have stayed in many hotels for work and leisure, but when I come to Los Angeles the ONLY hotel that I desire to call home for my short stay is the Sheraton Gateway Hotel. As soon as I pull onto the property I am greeted with smiles and a helpful hand by the valet team. The front desk clerks are also very friendly and helpful making sure my stay is rewarding. We are now living in a time where customer service no longer exists, but the staff of the Sheraton Gateway gets it and they go out of their way to make every guest feel special and important. Keep up the exceptional work and I will continue to call the Sheraton Gateway my home away from home.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>I didn't expect much when I booked the Sheraton but when I arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the warm reception by Coco at the front desk. I was treated as a special guest and my room was upgraded. The room was very comfortable and the stay was the best!

Nice for location and cost.  Shuttle drivers don’t stop without running into the road to flag them down.  Lol.  Half the floor smelled like weed.  It is an airport hotel but it is visible just how many in and out stays there must be.  Guests services were very helpful.  Food at the bar restaurant was exceedingly good.<//text>

<Review>Considering how expensive LA is was nice to find a hotel close to the airport that was priced right. This hotel is huge with nice lobby area with it's own Starbucks and full service restaurants. Breakfast is a buffet or alacarte it's not free but very good options. If you just want to relax and not step out, it's the place to be. Rooms are clean a bit dated but really cool for the price.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>This hotel is in a good location for getting to places near LAX, not a lot within walking distance. The lobby was nice but overall I don't get a sense that the room was the cleanest it could be and the rooms are a little dated. I hated the motion lights in the room. If you get up in the middle of the night to go the bathroom the motion triggers the entrance and bathroom lights and blind you. And tile floor was ice cold to bare feet in the bathroom.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Check in on my Bonvoy app was very easy, and my keys were ready upon arrival. Raul helped us with our bags and was so friendly and welcoming. Room was very comfortable. We just stayed overnight to catch an early flight. The airport shuttle was waiting when we came downstairs. Perfect overnight stay before flying out!</review>

<Text>Located so close to car rental returns and to the airport, that it only took 20 minutes to drop off my car and get to the airport. Being so close, I would have expected to hear airplanes all night, but the room was remarkably soundproof. The gift shop was very nice since I needed to pick up a few things, and the bar was very pleasant too. My room was the best room I have ever stayed in, as I was upgraded to an executive suite since I am a BonVoy member. I wish I could have stayed longer!<//Text>< Time>

I have to say that the staff at this hotel are friendly, helpful and accommodating. The only thing they need to work on is the smell of rooms and to be more aware of broken fixtures. My first room had a strange smell and was very quiet, but I couldn't stay there, due to the strange smell, but the hotel desk clerk made sure to accommodate me a better fresh clean room, but it had a broken mirror that didn't light up, but other than that it was fabulous and had a great view!</Text>

First let me say that the gentlemen at Valet Parking were great. The person that sticks out the most in my head is Mike. He is personifies what great customer service is. He was very professional and knowledgable about our needs. I would like to comment on the frequency of problems that this hotel has with its elevators. That is a major problem for the individuals who need to go up and down the elevator each day. Lastly I would like to say as a loyal Marriott member this hotel needs to up its services in the Concierge Lounge. This was by far the worse one I have been to. The is no meat options severed in the lounge during breakfast hours. How is this possible! The eggs were constantly cold and if I decided to pay the $20 something odd dollars to go downstairs to the lobby restaurant they serve the same exact thing but they throw in bacon and sausage. The Sheraton is much better than that. I probably won't recommend this Hotel to my coworkers when they come in town to stay for months on in.< /text>

<Review>If you are looking for a cost vs services, I would say this is the best place to stay around or near the LAX airport. The slightly higher cost is WELL offset by the location, travel as well as all of the extra services that the hotel and staff provide. My last two stays here were for business, but saved me the money I would have had to spend in transportation and other local services. 

Amazing people work here. They are helpful, friendly and go above and beyond just their jobs. Great place to stay if you have to  work or for vacation. 

The location is more than convenient being right by LAX and extra services for local attractions were present. I hope to be able to come back for a vacation next time. I will surely be staying here.</Review><username>SGrant< /username>< rate>

Extremely dissatisfied with my stay here at the Sheraton Gateway.

This hotel was basically like an upgraded version of motel 8. Perhaps I am spoiled with the amenities and hospitality found in Asian hotels, but there wasn't any toothbrushes, slippers or robes in the rooms. The hotel staff were not very welcoming or helpful. I asked multiple staff for recommendations on where to eat late night, initially they gave me a blank stare and then suggested restaurants that were already closed. No one offered to help bring my luggage to my room. The hotel smelled like marijuana around nearly every corner and in the halls on my floor. It almost seemed as though the hotel had been renting rooms to the homeless community of LA.

There was even a group of people filming a rap video in the entrance of the hotel (no social distancing or mask requirements).

With all of the covid-19 buzz going around, I expected a hotel with the reputation of Sheraton to have people sanitizing the elevator and door handles. I didn’t see anyone cleaning anything except for the carpet that laid on the ground in front of the hotel entrance.

For $170 a night I would NOT stay at this hotel again or recommend it to anyone.<//text>

Negative: They charge a $50 fee for valet parking but it¿s not really valet because you have to park yourself in front of the hotel. Otherwise you have to park a distance away from the hotel. The hotel smelled of cigarettes my entire stay. Dated hotel.< /review>

<review>Had to stay here because we missed our connecting flight due to a plane delay. American put us in this hotel and I don't have any complaints! The room was nice, the hotel is beautiful and the bed was super comfortable. I wish our food voucher was enough to cover breakfast though.< /review>< pictures>

Overall the hotel is pretty nice and clean. My room was pretty modern and clean. But...the room's walls were so thin that I could hear people snore and go to the bathroom in the rooms next door. The restaurant downstairs staff is extremely bad. I had to eat there 4 times and all 4 times were just bad service. Front desk always has a line. Always! Even at 1am! The guest service guy told me that they could not hold my jacket so I had to open my luggage and jam it in there. I've used guest services all around the world and never was told that they couldn't hold my jacket.<//Review>

This is a beautiful property, super convenient to the airport and at a great price point when we booked it. We had a bad experience when checking in: we arrived and there was no assistance with bags. This was forgivable because there was a crowd checking in. Dumb luck happenstance - you can’t predict a crowd checking in around midnight I guess. But after waiting in a long line to check in, reception refused to check my family in because I wasn’t present (returning the car). Again, midnight and everyone was exhausted. But protocol was more important than welcoming a guest. Every other service interaction we had was positive< /review>

< Review>
This hotel experience was a bad one from beginning to end. My plan was to have a comfortable, easy, close place to sleep between an event in downtown LA Friday evening and my flight out of LAX early Saturday morning. The hotel was not comfortable, the check-in process was a nightmare, and there was no room service available for either a late night or early morning snack. The restaurant that was supposed to be open well past my arrival time closed the kitchen early, and the front desk staff had no solution other than saying room service would be available “eventually”. The heating system in the room blew loudly and constantly all night and the noise from the hall where hotel staff were setting up for a conference the next day interrupted my sleep multiple times.< /Review>

Amazing.

Front desk staff efficient, and polite.
Room service was on time, the correct order and delivered by a charming employee.
It's very close to the airport, but NOT noisy.

<review>The lounge breakfast has been reduced to the "minimum required by Marriott" according to their F&B manager. This effectively drops them from a 4 star to a 3 star hotel based on hotelier standards. Plenty of other choices nearby include a better breakfast.<//review><Name>George Capen</Name>< Rating>

Anthony the front desk agent that helped checked me in was so sweet and informative. At the same time of informing me about what the Sheraton has to offer he also checked me in fast which was great. Anytime someone comes from a long travel we’d liked to get check in quick but also being informed to a great amount was awesome !<//Text>

To be honest, it was not that nice staying there and I was wondering was that a real Sheraton. The staffs there looked not that friendly and not helpful at all. They couldn’t solve any problems and told me that nothing they could help. I’m wondering if it’s professional or appropriate to say that to their costumers even though they didn’t try to solve the problem. Most horrible thing was that one night at about 12am, a lady opened my door and suddenly came into my room. Luckily my husband heard that and woke up. When the lady saw him she said sorry and left. I never met this situation before at other hotels. I felt really unsafe staying there. Anyway, it is not worth that money to stay at that “4 star” hotel like that. So disappointed about it.</text>

Horrible property that fell well below any standard you could hope for. The bathroom was incredibly small and their beds had no fitted sheet. Unfortunately due to my late travel time, I was unaware of the fact that they did not have fitted sheets. I woke up on the bare mattress and now my skin is breaking out. I will be taking this up with their management team however I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to my worst enemy!<//text>

I find it amazing that there are only two channels on the TV that are fuzzy, Fox News and fox Business. Maybe it's a coincidence, but Marriott does advertise on CNN. Everything else about the hotel is great. Staff Is really friendly, it appears to be recently remodeled and there are lots of amenities. Free shuttle service to and from the airport and a  Starbuck in the lobby. All in all the hotel is an outstanding hotel.</Review>

<Text>As a hotel that relies on transient guests, they should understand that guests are tired or in a hurry. The check in process took too long, did not have anyone taking elite members and they did not provide correct room on reservation even when expressly discussed during check-in. This resulted in necessitating a room change after getting upstairs to the wrong room. When youre choosing this hotel to maximize 6 hours of sleep time during layover, the lost 30-45 min  is frustrating<//Text>< pics>

PROS: 
•Location is literally at the main entrance of LAX
•Receptionist was wonderful 
•The room was clean overall
•The $75 incidental deposit was promptly released upon check out.

CONS:
•The old carpet and furniture dates the rooms
•Unauthorized charge - Someone else’s $79 meal was charged to my room. The staff told me they had canceled the amount upon check out but I was still charged that night. I had to file a dispute to get the money back. 
•The valet parking is $44 and very slow to retrieve my vehicle.<//review>

Very grateful to be given a free lounge access even though I’m just a good elite upon enquiring of the price (booked with points and no option of getting a lounge access). Had a nice breakfast at the lounge before heading to the airport. We were rushing to go back to the room after breakfast knowing that we had to catch the shuttle for our flight, when we came down there were three airport shuttle buses waiting outside!!!

Being retired we travel for leisure. The facilities have much more amenities than we need as a “base of operations” for our excursions around the city. Still the hotels are usually conveniently located for our needs, rooms are comfortable and the staff are very responsive. Therefore a Marriott or Sheraton is usually a part of our trips. It was a good choice by Delta to place us at Sheraton Gateway in LA after missing our connecting flight.</Review>

This place is the best for anyone who wants to stay close to the airport. They have a great shuttle service. We had a early morning international flight and choose to stay at Sheraton the night before, giving the traffic in la this is one of the best options close to the airport<//review>

<Text>Easy to get to from airport and staff very friendly. Food fresh and tasty and very generous in size. Carpet very worn in room but overall very comfortable. Must advise how to get shuttle as it was very confusing. We needed to go up escalators and then the trucklike bus can be flagged outside each terminal.</Text><date>1576454400000< /date>< response>

Modern and well managed property. I was never a fan of Sheraton but this location is pretty good. Cost for onsite valet parking is kinda steep - $55 per day..</review>

I had the pleasure of being checked in by a front desk employee named Leah. She was beyond exceptional. She made me feel valued, appreciated and important. My stay was amazing but Leah made the stay ten times better. I wish hotel staff were staff were more like her everywhere. Overall amazing stay.<//text>< Resp>

Though the hotel is very close to LAX airport it can be use for long stay. Being there you can feel at home with big spaces and very friendly personnel. It is easy to access the big roads and reach your destination easily. I was surprised on how quiet it is, you totally forget you are close to an airport.<//Review>

<Review>Thie staff here stands out and I fly for an airline and sleep in a lot of hotels. I have stayed here four or five times and without exception every hotel representative with whom I have dealt has been exceptionally helpful and friendly. I have had similiar individual experiences at other hotels but this is one of the very few hotels where this appears to be the baseline. From the front desk staff to the restaurant/bar up to Ms. Heidi in the club lounge excellence seems the norm.

The rooms are up to date, the restaurant food is excellent and the price is right for the value recieved.</Review>< Pics>

Service was better when sheraton was separate from Marriott. Don?t feel like they read your profile requests and see that you don?t want an adjoining room as it states or automatically upgrade based on status as they used too.</Text>

Customer service was not good at all! When I arrived, I called room service from my room and no one answered. After several attempts, I went downstairs to the restaurant only to sit at the bar to order and be completely ignored. I then left and ordered my food at the restaurant hostess station. The lady never even told me that my food was ready. I’m over it! NEVER AGAIN!!!<//text>

Overall the stay was not too bad. The toilet did back up but was quickly fixed. Rates were incorrect (I used booking.com) and had to be fixed. I was overcharged and still waiting on my refund. I was billed for parking fees (I did not bring a vehicle) but that was resolved. Rooms are nice and clean and quiet. I love the Starbucks! Hotel food below average. Most staff are very helpful, a few were very rude. It’s in a nice location and I like the pool area when cabanas are available (half of the time they are reserved).<//text>

I was so happy to see many of the former Sheraton staff members who continued to make this short visit most enjoyable.  I was worried about how the Marriot ownership would change or eliminate some of my Sheraton benefits.  New policies eliminated some of the former perks and some front desk staff did not state all the upgrades and amenities or gifts available to gold elite members.  Has Marriot eliminated them?   Anyway I love the hotel and plan to stay for 3 or 4 nights in May based on all my good memories and the great facilities .  The hotel  has great facilities, a terrific bar, and excellent accommodations .  It is well maintained and very clean.  I would recommend  more vegan options on their menus as this is LA.  Some live music would be nice too,  but I am returning in May because I love it.</Text>

This location met all my needs. The staff was friendly from the front of the house to the back of the house. The staff treated me as a guest and made me feel very welcomed. I noticed the effort they put into making sure I was comfortable. Thanks Sheraton for providing excellent accommodations and professional training to your staff. I would stay here again.<//Text>

the front desk, room servers, everybody that has face-face interaction with guest are very polite and nice. (of course their job requires to be)
Accounting department is a JOKE: I got extra charged on my card, have been transferred to accounting department and no one picks up, left several voicemails, no call back. called and yelled on the front desk employee, then she was able to connect to live accountant. all they did apologized for an extra charge with a promise of refunding. **be aware of when giving your card for a accidental damage". my company and I both would have been charged doubled if I never noticed the extra charge ($170) after three weeks of the charge.< /text>

This hotel has a music event until 5 am which they did not let their guests know at check in. We got in on a late flight and went straight to hotel. Thinking it would be fine as my Dad was getting medical treatment in the morning and it was a one night stay. The music event was on until 5 am and another room had a party going on. When I called reception they said sorry we can change your room but the event is on until 5am. It was late in the evening and they thought it would be easy for us to repack and move. Never will I stay at this hotel again!</text>

Positive: Its's normally a great hotel. Not so much anymore. The rooms are nice and comfy, and it's a great location for airport travel. Quick van service a good hotel staff. Negative: This hotel has become disgusting. People smoking weed everywhere, outside, in the rooms, in the hallways. Management doesn't I guess charge a deposit. The room will smell like people have been smoking in it, and it will come through the AC vents too.</review>

<Review>To be honest, it was not that nice staying there and I was wondering was that a real Sheraton. The staffs there looked not that friendly and not helpful at all. They couldn’t solve any problems and told me that nothing they could help. I’m wondering if it’s professional or appropriate to say that to their costumers even they didn’t try to solve the problem. Most horrible thing was that one night at about 12am, a lady opened my door and suddenly came into my room. Luckily my husband heard that and woke up. When the lady saw him she said sorry and left. I never met this situation before at other hotels. I felt really unsafe staying there. Anyway, it is not worth that money to stay at that “4 star” hotel like that. So disappointed about it.<//Review><time>1573634335791< /time><gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d< /gmap_id>< response>

Just what I needed after a long flight from Taipei and a good night’s rest before my next morning flight.
Although I chose this hotel for its convenience for an overnight stay, I would consider staying here longer in the future when I am next in the Los Angeles area.</Review>

Great hotel with friendly staff. Our flight was canceled so the airline booked a two night stay at this hotel with vouchers for food until we could could get a flight out of LA. The airline created some issues with the vouchers for the two night stay but the hotel staff worked with us to resolve the situation. They accepted a PDF from the airline assuring payment. The food was fantastic as was the room. The service in the Bar area was a bit slow which is the only reason I gave service 4 stars. The location is very close to the airport which really helped. Shuttles to and from the airport run constantly. Overall a very pleasant experience. Thank you so much.</review>

<time>1565913600000</time><text>The check in process was very unpleasant. There wasn’t really a Separate line for elite members. There were two Sheraton employee checking people in at what seems to be the busiest time while the other employee were hovering over. The person who checked me in rushed my check in process. I was eligible for a room upgrade which I didn’t get. She didn’t tell me about my parking options or dining options. I had to check in and come back down and get in a huge line to ask where to park my car.  I currently reside in San Diego and don’t really come to Los Angeles but I was in town because I had a friend visiting and she wanted to explore the town before we head to San Diego the next day. I was raving to her about my Marriott point and that I though I got us a nice hotel hotel but our experience overall was very unpleasant.  I wouldn’t pick Sheraton over a Marriott hotel again.</text><Rate>None< /Rate>< Name>

<Text>The best part of the hotel is that it is very close to the airport. I think this is extremely important for transit customers. The hotel service was also nice. Every time I needed something and placed a call to the operator, it was an immediate response. I just did not like how the rooms were not soundproof. I don’t mind the airplanes taking on/off all the times, but was not a fan of hearing slamming of doors in the nearby rooms. We even heard other people’s conversation, phone rings, etc. Thus, I personally will not consider to stay in this hotel.< /Text><Time>1555891200000<//Time>< resp>

Love this place!  I was looking for a hotel with the best rate that was close to LAX. I came across the Sheraton, and booked because it had a great price and shuttle that runs every 15 to 20 minutes that drops you off at the airport free of charge. It was very convienent and stress free. Just wish parking wasn’t so expensive, still great though.</review>

This hotel is very complacent. Many members of staff at the concierge desk will only go out of their way if they feel that a tip might be coming their way, otherwise expect contempt.

Receptionists on the whole were very good except an experience on Christmas day by a lady sitting at the Bonvoy Premium desk on the morning of Christmas day , who told me off like a headmistress of a school. I switched to another receptionist and she was a star , but bad experiences have a far bigger impact than positive experiences , that is why complacency does not help. Housekeeping staff are all great people- but the restaurant is awful very bad menu with limited choices.</Review>

The manager at this hotel is extremely rude and lacks people skills. If you are having issues with eve service then don’t expect any resolutions with this manager. They are so many other hotels  In the area with better rooms and efficient service</review>

Helpful and attentive staff, seemed like they love what they’re doing, went above and beyond. Room was a little bit outdated but it was very clean. Modern bathroom, white and fluffy towels, speedy internet. Microwave was available next to vending machine. Lounge was huge for an airport hotel and had everything I needed such as printer, hot food, etc. There was a nice pool with hot tub and gazebo on site. For an airport hotel, it’s above my expectation.< /Text>

The facilities are what I expect from a Sheraton - bar, restaurant, pool (outdoor), jacuzzi, exercise room.   The rooms are good sized, bed is comfortable.

<review>I chose this hotel because of proximity to LAX and because the price was competitive. We found the whole experience to be far above most other airport hotels we have stayed in.
The rooms are great! They are large and have great seating for a couple. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was roomy and attractive and functional.
Overall, this was a surprise and delight.<//review><rating>None< /rating>< Response>

I had the pleasure of staying at your hotel for the Best Buy Training Event. The catering staff that assisted with the even on both days was exceptional. Estella and the team were attentive and courteous. They helped everyone out with any and all requests. It is the second year I’ve gotten to work at your hotel and I am never disappointed with the service.</Text>

This is a nice hotel, very conveniently located right near LAX, and with a good airport shuttle service.  After I checked out, an erroneous charge ($8.49) was sneakily added to my credit card, and I wasn't notified.  I am in the process of trying to resolve this.  You can't reply to the e-mail address that the copy of the bill comes from (it is apparently bogus and not an e-mail address); since it was 10 days the Front Desk couldn't help; and I have to contact Accounting to get it reversed.  This system is poorly designed from the guest's perspective.  It is time consuming and inconvenient, when the hotel has made a mistake, and needs to be re-thought.</review>

It was only one night but the service and attention to detail was much appreciated. We also loved having a Starbucks inside the hotel which we conveniently bought before catching our shuttle to the airport. The only issue we had was the shuttle bus driver was a little dismissive of us and he ended up passing our terminal. When we told him, he just dropped us off at another terminal and told us to walk. It was about 3/4 mile walk...NOT at all what you want to do right before a cross country flight with a bunch of luggage. Thank God we were early. But other than that, we enjoyed our stay.</review>

I only had an overnight stay here but the room and bathroom were large, clean and comfortable, the in-room dining was delicious, and the staff were friendly and helpful. I arrived without any luggage and the staff didn't hesitate in providing me with toiletries or charging my phone for me when my battery was low. It was genuinely one of the best hotel experiences I've had and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again in future.<//Review>

<Review>Catching an early morning flight. The Sheraton made that early morning flight very easy. The staff was helpful with the luggage both checking in and out. And with an airport shuttle running every 15 minutes, there was no stress about getting to the airport on time. The staff was available to answer any questions I had and help with any needs. Will definitely be back.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Rate>

<Review>Our flight was cancelled out of LAX so we decided to stay at the Sheraton Gateway LA and what a great decision that was! There are a lot of choices near LAX but we knew Sheraton is class act.  Checkin was swift and our room overlooked the airport. Great sound barrier let us watch the planes but not hear them at all! Club lounge food was over the top, Starbucks inside the lobby and their gift shop are well stocked and wonderfully staffed. The price was very reasonable for such short notice, and they even have a free shuttle to the airport. We will definitely be back, thank you Sheraton!</Review>< user>

<Review>Used this location because my daughter had an early flight next day . Shuttles were great , I shuttled with her to drop her off and then caught the shuttle back to my car and checked out. Totally worth the nights stay to not have the stress of the morning 5/405 traffic from San Diego .  All hotel staff we encountered were very nice . Clean modern hotel , would definitely stay again.<//Review><rate>None<//rate>< Pictures>

Good hotel if you need to be near airport.  Transportation provided from the airport to the hotel.  The hotel is clean and the staff are friendly.  You are not near the beach or sight seeing.  There are ways to get transportation if you like to go sightseeing or to the beach.<//review>

We had to cancel our flight at LAX due to the travel ban. This hotel had a room and easy access for us to get to from LAX. The bistro was also open late allowing us to get food.< /Review>

Comfortable and clean rooms, very comfortable beds with excellent facilities. 

Great job and thank you to the team at Sheraton Gateway LAX for another comfortable stay.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<time>1550534400000<//time><Rating>None< /Rating><review>Outstanding hotel with fabulous food options available onsite.  This hotel has the usual, wonderful 4 star amenities, fitness center, pool, heavenly bedding, and comfortable rooms with comfortable seating, TVs, etc, depending on which type of room you choose.  The lobby is nice with plenty of elevators available so you don't have to wait long, and the restaurant and lounge options available onsite are fantastic.  The room service is pretty fast, all things considered and the food arrives hot, fresh, and service is professional, friendly, and with the right touch of hospitality.  This Sheraton receives my "Good" rating due to the self-parking experience which is quite a large city block away and you need to get a ticket from the front desk every 24 hours.  Also, I had one unfriendly housekeeping encounter.  All things considered, we interacted with maybe 10 or 12 employees whom we felt bent over backward to make sure we had absolutely everything and anything we needed,...JUST the way we needed or wanted it.  What a great experience.  If you'd like it to be "perfect", I'd recommend valet parking.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<text>It was great being able to get away for a day! From the moment I walked in to the minute I left, I felt like royalty! Didn’t pack a toothbrush? No worries the front desk has got you covered! Hungry for a late night snack? They got you covered! It is great knowing you can get away without ever leaving town and better yet, without making a dent on your pocket! Plus perfect location to go out and have a night in the city, then wake up and head to the beach for brunch!</text>< Pics>

< review>
I stayed three nights at the Sheraton Gateway (LAX) in October for a conference.  The room was wonderfully comfortable with a view of the airports departing from LAX.  I thought at first it was going to be very noisy, but it was not that bad and a great view at night with all of the lights on.  The room was exceptionally clean and the bed and pillows were very comfortable.  We had catered meals and snacks for the conference and the food was good, especially the coffee.  I would really like to commend the room cleaning staff and the staff that tended to us for the coffee/tea service and the catered meals.  These staff members were exceptional and assisted with each request or need quickly, with kindness, which I appreciated.  I would definitely stay here again.</review>

Stayed 3 nights for a conference. Room great and bed comfy. Only problem in room was the safe wouldn't lock. Housekeeping service rate and room super clean. Starbucks a big PLUS! A little disappointed with the guest services desk. My Roomate was from UK and needed help with finding train schedule LA to San Diego. I took her to the desk and she was told she could look it up on line. I was really disappointed to see 2 guys standing at guest services (not the check in desk) and not assist an international guest by going online and helping the guest. If they couldn't do it they should find someone who can. Parking cost too high. The restaurant food I'd say was fair. I ordered a flatbread w/meat & veggies and the edges were burned and the taste was unimpressive- very disappointing.  I brought hate boiled eggs for one meal/day and went to restaurant for salt and pepper. Shakers were gathered on a shelf near the bar and I reached for salt and pepper to sit down at the table and eat. The waiter kind of jumped at me and wanted to know where I was going with the shaker. Other than that- the hotel had a great overall vibe for being so close to the airport. I was overall very comfortable and would definitely come back.</review>

<Review>My main motivation for booking this hotel was to swim in a heated pool. So I called 3 days ahead of my intended stay and asked about the pool hours and whether it was heated or not. I was told that is was heated and that it was open until 10pm. I booked and we arrived, checked in, and realxed until pool time. We were told by staff that the pool was under renovation and that I could travel to another hotel if I would like to use a pool. Obviously renovation is a positive thing but staff being unaware of the status of significant perks is unacceptable for such a nice hotel. "The room was nice, gym was great, but I came so my toddler and pregnant wife could relax and swim in what they said was offered and I could have easily chosen a different hotel or stayed another night with my cousin.</Review>< Resp>

<Text>5 stars going out.  The valets were very courteous and the wait for the shuttle was not too bad leaving the hotel.

Two stars on the return...The story, upon returning was not as rosy.  The shuttle took a long time to get to the Southwest terminal (and it's terminal 1).  It took almost 30 minutes to get back to the Sheraton with an overfilled van!  There were other issues, but enough said.< /Text>< Resp>

<Review>The hotel no longer seems to want to attract Marriott elites. This used to be a good option for Marriott/SPG elites who were flying out of LAX. However, they recently downgraded service in the club lounge so that it is a bare bones breakfast in the morning and very limited appetizers in the evening. 
The rooms are adequate, if dated. Service at front desk can be a bit slow if you arrive at the wrong time. Cleanliness is okay — we found a pair of eyeglasses in our room from someone who had previously stayed there. (The front desk didn’t seem surprised by this when we returned them.) The housekeeper stopped by our room during our children’s nap to request that we leave at 3 pm rather than 4 pm since 4 pm was when her shift ended (which seems strange when Bonvoy guarantees a 4 pm checkout for platinum and above). 

Bottom line: we’d recommend this place if there are no other hotels in the area with availability, but there are better options for frequent travelers.< /Review>< pics>

The check-in process was easy and we were given early check-in which always starts your stay off right! The room was beautiful and so clean.  The bar downstairs is a bustling metropolis morning, noon, or night! As energetic as this was, it was also hard to actually use the "business center" because it was so loud and located right smack dab in the bar area. I would love for the business center to be located away from the bar and restaurant area, as well as to have a door to provide privacy. I couldn't find a quiet place anywhere to make a personal phone call.
But what I LOVED THE MOST was the workout center/gym. I went both days I was there - once in the evening and once at 4:30 am. Both times the room was filled with amazing machines, ellitipticals, bicycles, treadmills and more. Every single machine was clean and ready to go, along with bottles of water, hand towels, music, and a TV. The room has a lovely view onto the pool area. Any time I went I felt so safe and secure as there are monitoring cameras and a key scan at the door. Truly this workout stay made a great stay even better!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Been staying here every year, but no more. You can tell all the places where the owners cut expenses. The club breakfast no longer has simple things like juice, cereal, bagels pastries. The common areas such as ballroom, lobby are freezing cold with no heat. Ended getting sick staying here. Stay elsewhere.<//text>

PROS: Comfy bed, clean room, lots of amenities within hotel. 
CONS: pricy laundry $3.00 for each wash/dry (that’s a bit much!), staff should know the cost of laundry, but didn’t. Parking was $17.55. We left to go eat dinner and had to pay that twice for a 14 hour stay at this hotel. Self parking is quite a walk. 
RECOMMENDATION: if microwaves aren’t available in room, offer a microwave in a common area on each floor.</Text>

I came early as that was the only time my ride could bring me. Coco at registration was absolutely amazing! Welcomed me with open arms, then gave me elite status. Thank you all at Sheraton gateway LAX for being so kind and professional. 👍👍👍😃</Text>

Very nice establishment. I was there for an event only. The way it was ran was excellent. I was taking care of business and ended up staying when the break down/clean up crew came in. They were phenomenal! Talk about Teamwork makes the dream work. They broke that room down in nothing flat. I was impressed by that. Nkw once I stay there, if the rooms are anything like the ballroom, well 5 stars it is. Job well done Sheraton!!< /text>

Sorry have to give a bad review. There are so many better hotels at LAX, that actually have less stars. People, this is not a high standard Sheraton and I would put it in the 2 star range. Don't pay for the hype!</text>

Everything was fine. I really don’t have any complaints other the shower was cold every morning. But I got over it pretty quick. I was over for a conference, so I got to use two of your conference rooms, the lobby, the 15th fooor club room, the bar, the pool area, and the outside parking area (all these were relevant meeting areas for the conference). I had no issues with any of the rooms and thoroughly enjoyed my stay — just the cold shower. 4/5 stars from me!</review>

We stayed at this hotel for quite a long spell...great place with wonderful staff...but my wife incurred an injury to her knee while walking thru the parking lot at the front of the hotel at night. There was a dark colored plank of work separating the cars in the lot and she tripped on it, and damaged her knee. She was in a wheelchair for 2-3 weeks and we notified the hotel managers, security personnel, upper level vp's but nothing was done to compensate us for the inconvenience, pain and suffering we encountered. It's been quite a few months now and nothing's been resolved...the only reason I gave 4 Stars is because of the staff but the upper management has been negligent in handling this matter although we are ambassador elite clients...<//review>

Fantastic hotel. Great location minutes from LAX and the property is immaculate. 24 hour room service and the bar and lounge generally stay open until 1AM. Club level offers free continental breakfast and 24 hour access to refreshments, coffee/cappuccino and espresso as well as a nice place to lounge with friends and family to watch television or movies. The rates here are extremely competitive which earns this hotel 5 stars from a well traveled man.</review>

I only stayed one night between flights but found my stay to be most comfortable. The staff was inviting, the interiors were clean and felt up to date, and the rooms were well appointed, with adequate soaps, towels, a fridge (empty) and a microwave on every floor.

I would happily stay here again.<//review>

<Text>This is a decent hotel for a fairly economical price (for the area). It's right next to LAX with a shuttle to the airport. Parking is an absurd amount though, so since we just stayed one night and didn't need to come and go we parked at the airport's Park N Fly for less than half the cost of hotel parking. We're not afraid of walking so just hoofed it the few blocks from there to the hotel. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. The pool area wasn't great. The pool was heated, but barely, and there's one small hot tub with a max capacity of 4 people for an enormous hotel. I didn't have any interactions with reception, shuttle drivers, bartenders or housekeeping, so I can't speak to the staff, but being that I'm low maintenance and just needed a nice bed to sleep in near the airport this Sheraton did the trick.< /Text>< gmap_id>

The basic ourtesies offered to elite members are now non-existent. No priority check-in. No attention paid to room prefernces. Gone also are early check-in and late check out courtesies. Bathroom amenities are far inferior to competition. Cleanliness is an issue (towels, floors, etc.)

For a better stay, far superior alternatives exist. And they cost less. And they certainly would be a wiser investment in the future. 

I regret what Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles has become!< /review>

It's the city and an old building, so really nothing can be done to change this.  Fabulous wine and cheese in the evenings.  Complementary water bottles in the room :) Second night we moved to a corner suite.  Worth the extra money.  Great light and enjoyed the extra space.  Continental breakfast was good.  Location here is fantastic.   We loved all the little

<text>This property was an amazing property at one time and it is a shame how it has gone down hill.  The staff act like it’s a bother rather than their job to service the guests.  The bar area where I had dinner was so unprofessional I can’t even put to words how it tainted my meal.  The lack of care to customers and the only concern was them gossiping and giving one another a hard time.  They aired their dirty Laundry and a manager even hung out around there and didn’t care or was so oblivious that he didn’t see it. I had an issue with purchasing a movie and called the front desk and they sent engineering.  This poor guy had no idea what do to but at least he was apologetic.  He said he would hold restart to wait 10 minutes and try again.  I did just that and it didn’t work.  He came back up and stated that the system was restarted and that I should try another movie so I did and still nothing.  Now I have 3 movies on my bill.  I called down and asked for them to remove them and they said they did once engineering came down to tell them it wasn’t fixed.  Engineering came back up with 2 breakfast tickets and said that the location was sold out and that I could not change rooms.  He at least felt bad about the situation.  When checking my bill in the morning from my email I noticed 3 movie charges.  I called front desk and ask why they haven’t been removed.  The lady asked who told me they would be removed and I explained that the front desk last night and engineering since the movies never played.  She put me on hold for quite some time to speak to a manager.  She came back on the line and said ok I’ll remove.  An hour later I go down stairs to check out which I never do as I normally call but I now have no faith in getting an accurate bill.  I go down to check out and the front desk lady says the same total as before. I explained the situation and my call this morning and she wanted to know who I spoke to and who authorized the removal of the movie charges.  At that time the lady 2 registers down said oh that was me and I haven’t done it yet.  The person who was helping me released my bill so that the other individual could finalize by credit.  I should never of had to go through this as it should have been resolved when the system failed to work. 

Carpets in the hallway and in rooms looked dirty and tattered.  Sofas looked dirty 

I will not return as I don’t feel this property truly reflects the Sheraton brand name and standards.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Easy to find airport shuttle. Get to the hotel in just a few minutes. 
Smooth checking-in & out. The receptionist get us keys in just seconds.
Tasty In-room-dining. Delivered in a timely manner during dinner time. 

We requested dental kits & shaving kit prior to arrival, however these were not delivered. Also no bath robe in room, so ask for them before arrival if needed. 

Overall very pleasant stay.<//Text>

The room alarm clock went off three hours before we needed to wake up - 5:00 in the morning. Waking the children and no one was able to go back to sleep. The front desk didn't care about the inconvenience. The line at Starbucks was 30 minutes long because of a convention that was going on at the time. They were out of milk and cream and got half of our order wrong. They were very sorry about the wait and issues at Starbucks. However it was still frustrating.

<review>The guy at the front desk was way unkind. I was not satisfied with their guest services. Also I had two of the queen beds, but the set up for the bathroom was only for one person, one set so I had to call for more bath sets. 
The food quality for breakfast buffet was also poor unlike it priced pretty high. 
This was the worst experience from my past experience with Sheraton.< /review>< pictures>

Outstanding hotel for conventions and meetings or any large event.  No sight view, so don't come for that reason.  Food in the bar and restaurant was good but seating and service was very slow.  They didn't have enough staff working to handle the crowd.  Very close to LAX. Rims eye spacious comfortable and clean<//review>

What to expect? horrible nights of sleep like these 2.  I’ve always stayed in upscale hotels and I wanted to give the Sheraton an opportunity, disappointing.

Got locked out of my room because the battery on the door died. It took front desk, security, and maintenance 30 minutes to get me back in. Would be nice if they replaced the batteries before they died. I did learn how to break into rooms by watching maintenance do it. It is scarily easy.  Make sure to apply all possible locks when you start at a hotel!<//review>

<Review>This used to be my top choice for an LAX airport for the last 10 years.  particularly, as a titanium SPG guest, I enjoyed the breakfast at the executive lounge.  As of December 2019 the hotel has downsized a great spread to the equivalent of what you'd find at a Motel 6 continental breakfast.  I'll be switching to some neighbouring hotel unless I get word that that SPG service comes back.< /Review><rate>2</rate><Name>Saqib H. Qureshi< /Name>< Resp>

This property is conveniently located so close to LAX - only a couple of minutes away, and they have a complimentary shuttle. The place is spacious and clean and the staff at check-in were terrific. My room was super clean and comfortable with a nice view.

All of the staff were friendly and helpful - I was made to feel welcome the moment I entered the lobby.<//Text>

We stay at the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles Hotel every time we fly in or out of LAX.  We live four hours north of LA and like to stay pre and post travel. The staff is great, the rooms are very comfortable with all the amenities you need and the location is perfect.  We park our car in a nearby garage and we usually forgo the complimentary hotel shuttle and walk to our departure gate.  We will continue to look forward to our stays at this hotel.< /Text>

The bed and the rooms were clean. However, an alarm that I did not program went off at 3:30am. The front desk's response when told was simply to say they would notify the engineers. No apologies offer to make it right. Awful customer service experience.</Text>

I stayed at the Gateway for a conference this past week. Property was great, and a great location if you need to be by LAX.

The reason for the 3 stars: I waited for the free shuttle at Terminal 7 for 45 minutes - it is labeled "Joe's Parking Sheraton Gateway." The bus passed the pick-up spot 3 times; however, remained in the left lane (away from passenger pick-up) and did not stop or even slow down despite my waving it down. I called the hotel and they offered little support saying "they will try and call the driver." After paying for a Lyft and arriving at the hotel over an hour later, the front desk staff were unapologetic despite my frantically having to prep for a presentation in several minutes due to their delay.<//review>

The pool was under construction, and the elevators were overfilled in the morning — causing people to have to use the stairs which lead to the outside of the building. Other than those two issues, we enjoyed our stay.<//text>

I enjoyed staying at Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles 
Easy check in didn’t take much of my time. The hotel was close to the airport that is one of the main reasons of staying at the Sheraton. The room and bathroom was clean & spacious. The king size bed was very comfortable felt like I was sleeping in my own bed. That has never happen before. Up to date decor. Once I left the hotel I told my other half  We would rebook this hotel again. This hotel should have 5 stars. I recommend everyone to stay at Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles.< /Review>

<Text>Our room was very spacious. King bed was comfortable. Room & bathroom were very clean. We ordered room service, the attendee was great and the food also tasted wonderful. We would definitely stay here again! we had the view overlooking the pool and overall very impressed with the hotel. Check in/out staff were very nice. Location was great, only a 5 minute (free) shuttle bus to the airport.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

The bed was very comfortable. TV was good size with nice picture.  Walls seemed to be a bit thin as I could hear the noisy children in the next room.  It would be nice if all hotels put families with children on their own floor.  Restaurant food was very good.  Somewhat pricey, but not outrageous.<//text>

Very quiet despite being next to a very busy airport.  The shuttle service was awesome! Food was good at bar restaurant. Bathrooms are a little small, but it's not a "resort" destination so it's workable. We were upgraded to a suite and it was very spacious. The club lounge had light snacks and beverages.< /text>

<review>I have stayed in many hotels for business or school based trips and this has been an amazing stay, I don't hesitate to be able to say amazing many times. I loved my stay, as soon as we walked in I was able to see the level of integrity and dedication every employee has to the facility.Not to mention the room was super cozy and filled with tons of great view. I hope that if you stay here you try the best pretzel burger that their bar has to offer. Not to mention their drinks were super delicious!! In many ways this stay made me feel at home, thank you.</review>< rate>

The elevators are slower than molasses in a deep freeze and using the stairs was not a viable option so it was a lesson in patience. The location close to the airport was great. The food in the restaurants was very good but bring a fat wallet. It is very expensive. When a bowl of oatmeal is $12.00 an omelet for $19.00 doesn't seem so bad. Overall it was an enjoyable stay and a great place to have a conference.< /Review>< pictures>

Missed our flight so we checked in to the hotel around 10pm and went to our room to relax before going to dinner. Would be nice if hotel provided two free waters instead of one as there were two of us which is pretty normal. Went to dinner in the bar. Ordered mussels as an appetizer and some of the mussels were unopened and the the ones we ate were not very good. My wife ordered the port tacos which she picked some meat out of one and did not finish it or touch the other. I ordered the Solomon and it was over cooked and very dry. Did not finish and this was sad as we were both hungry. Waiter said every was fresh and wonderful and not helpful. He asked if were finished and we said yes and was surprised we did not eat much but took the plats and not once ask how our meal was. This is our only complaint everything else was wonderful.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

The elevator had a bit of a waiting line at night but all good.

Due to some very poor service given at the Costero Bar and Bistro the rating dropped from a 5 to a 2.  My friends and I were at Costero November 17th at 11:00 pm.  The Asian man (for a lack of better description because I didn't get his name) working the floor that evening didn't stop to take our orders.  Mind you we are all of color (African American) so yes we started to feel like it was some kind of discrimination due to how the man ignored us.   He pasted us by several times and wouldn't even stop to greet us.   So we had to stop him and make him do his job.   So we are sitting there for about 20  minutes watching this guy pass us by repetitively.  When my friend finally stopped him the server didn't want to take his order but he persisted.  We had to get up and chase down this server every time each person wanted to give him a order.  He had a attitude when if finally got to the table.   Mind you this place barely had any customers in it at the time so he couldn't use the excuse that he was busy.   It's too bad because the hotel is awesome and we had a great time, but one bad apple ruined all.< /Text>

<review>My first stay at a Sheraton hotel was perfect. I was upgraded to a suite which was fabulous. The room was spacious and well appointed. Power outlets and USB ports b the desks ( this should be an obvious place but many hotels don’t have it). The room had a refrigerator and a safe. The front desk staff was helpful, courteous and professional. The Sheraton Club lounge was well staffed. The food was excellent with several options during the evening reception. And the bed... super comfy. In fact, I missed breakfast because I decided to sleep a little longer! Overall my stay was fantastic and I look forward to staying here again. I’m glad I decided to try a Sheraton.< /review>< Pictures>

Great rooms and service. The suites are very relaxing.
Late room service - great when travelling in.
Small but nice pool area.
Regular and fast airport shuttle.
The Starbucks in the lobby is a real one - on the app so you can order ahead and it has the full menu.

If you have elite status watch the Concierge hours - breakfast finishes early!<//Review><time>1523923200000<//time><userid>None< /userid><rating>None<//rating>< resp>

<Text>Don't think when you say what time you will arrive that your room will be ready at that time !!!!
The above is the one main vital takeaway which had a huge impact on me on an otherwise great trip.  On booking here I was asked to say what time I would arrive.  I said I would be there at 7am.
Now considering the fee was over 1000 nz dollars for 3 nights I had I felt a totally reasonable expectation that I would gain access to my room at that exact time.
I arrived there from New Zealand after a 12 hour flight at 7am to be told I could not access my room until 3pm.  I said how I had made it clear I would be there at 7am but it was said that although you could say when you arrived it gave no guarantee.  As far as I'm concerned this should have been made clear for a hotel charging this much per night.
What annoyed me thereafter was that I accidentally drifted to sleep in reception and was told to wake up (fair enough).  I then saw someone asleep around the pool.  I felt that surely if I relax around the pool in my shorts and t shirt that going to sleep would be fine.  I was again told to wake up as someone next to me was as this was apparently 'a security issue'.  I felt given the situation this should have been okay.
The room was a nice room and a nice bed.  There was a little soap to shower with and a tiny shampoo and tiny conditioner.
The place seemed to have an ethos that rather than being anything special that you were paying for a privilege to be there.
The breakfast in the morning was nice but I couldn't help but wonder why on earth that wasn't included in the extortionate price.  An extra 30 dollars each morning.
I'm a vegan person and there wasn't any non dairy milk out so you ask for it and its then given in a glass.
The bar had one vegan option where I had a couple of burgers.  I feel the breakfast should have had some vegan protein sources, there were none.
Similarly I found it poor that outside the event I was at (virtual coach) taking place inside the hotel that the coffee outside did not offer any non dairy milk.
If I'd knew I could not get in my room when I arrived and the way the hotel was overall I would not have stayed there.  There are plenty of guest houses nearby I couldve stayed in for a 3rd of the price or less and just come over to my event.  Atleast I could have booked the night before and had a good nights sleep.
If you do want to go here at the very least don't assume your room will be ready when you arrive.  It had a huge impact on my energy levels.
Seeing 1076 nz dollars come out of my account today purely for the 3 nights stay makes me wonder where on earth that went to. A nice room and a nice bed.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1582730541734, 'text': 'Phil, thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

<text>I used my skymiles for this stay, so I can't really speak to cost. The hotel is very close to the airport and you can see planes landing. Of course you could hear them, but the noise wasn't a problem. Couldn't use the outdoor pool because it was cold, but it looked like a nice place to relax. The gym is nice. Didn't eat or drink there, but the bar has a huge screen tv that is nice to watch a game on. LA is a sprawling place with lots of traffic, so this hotel is close to some sight seeing places but far from others. Easy to get to Santa Monica beach.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

My husband and I stayed here for a 14 hour layover and it was great. The shuttle was easy to locate, it got us to the hotel in under 10 minutes, and check-in was a breeze even though we arrived at an odd time. Clean and spacious rooms perfect for getting a good night's sleep right before jumping on another flight. Food at restaurants inside was a little pricey for what you get but there are some other place to eat near the hotel. Overall perfect for a quick relaxing stay.< /text>

<review>Terrible. We got here the night after our wedding night to fly out for our honeymoon early the next morning. We slept for an hour before getting woken up by an extremely rowdy group of girls. We called down to the front desk 5 times before anyone came down and did anything about it. This process was over THREE HOURS. We had a conjoined room...we could hear them throwing up and yelling at each other. We were not offered a room change. Customer service was awful and extremely rude. Not helpful AT ALL.< /review><pics>None<//pics></record>

From the moment we arrived,  the valet staff were quick to assist us even though they were obviously busy. Even then,  they didn't rush us or make us feel unwelcome. On the contrary, they were friendly & helpful. Check in was also quick & easy. The staff here were also friendly & helpful. They have about six elevators so the wait there was never long. When we got up to our room we were expecting to find the bed took up most of the room. This wasn't the case. It was quite spacious, with plenty of room for a couch and a desk without walking sideways past anything. It was also clean and odorless. I've found most hotel rooms have an odor, as if trying to mask some kind of a smell. So, it was a nice surprise to find this room didn't smell and that added to the clean feeling. The restroom was one of the smallest I've ever seen, but it was modern and clean, and really that's all I ask for. We also had a few drinks at the bar, where again the staff was quick, and friendly. I'd like to point out, the hotel is "across the street" from LAX and I was not able to hear the airplanes from my room as I have in other hotels. I was quite surprised with that. Our overall experience was great. We'd definitely stay again.</Review>

I have been staying at this Hotel for more than  30 years on business visits to LA from Australia , its location is a plus but the staff especially the concierges always went that extra mile to help and assist in every way and the office staff were helpful plus restaurant staff. Love the space in the mini suites and the large suites. The club and the gym is a real plus.and the shuttle service to the airport.</Review>

Beautiful hotel, interior staff great! But beware of the valet parking attendants. Was quoted $17.00 to park overnight. When I received my cc statement I was charged $50.00. I contacted accounting and have been given nothing but the run around! Sheraton don't give me your canned reply of "our parking is comparable to all the hotels around us"! Be a leader and step up? To pay $50.00 for overnight parking when you pay $200.00+ for a room is outrages!!</text>

Positive: The room and the view Negative: We were in a room that shared a wall, I guess mostly used for families and we could hear everything from the people in the next room. Would try to find out if there are conferences happening and avoid this hotel if so<//review>

I did not stay here but I  came here for dinner and drinks.
The evening bar staff is amazing at making you feel important and comfortable. Even the guy bringing food from the kitchen was so professional.  Wow!
If the bar area and food service is this great I can imagine how great it would be to stay here as a guest.
They serve Stella.
Come here for sure.< /Review>

I arrived to a long line at the front desk (~10 guests) all lined up in front of the Gold/Platinum line. Nobody standing in the regular line. Status doesn't seem to mean anything here. When I went to check in, i learned that the front desk's system was down and that they couldn't find any reservations. No problem, they would create a reservation for me manually. SPG number doesn't go in because status is down (so i was charged for internet, no points for stay, etc...) and then at the end, front desk agent asks me to call Starwood to cancel the original reservation. I complain that hotel should take care of that. Front desk insists, so i go to my room and call. Starwood rep on the phone has no way to cancel reservation without charging cancellation penalty. I speak with the Front Office Supervisor Hossein, who tells me that I didn't need to call. The hotel staff is misinformed, but oh-well. No attempt to offer consolation. More waste of time. Checking out in the morning, front desk says they will email me my receipt. It never arrives. I had to spend 30 mins on the phone with guest services a week later to request the folio. Not my first stay at this hotel, but this place has really gone downhill.<//Text></record>

Property is ideally located for those who have to come/go via LAX. There are several problems that will vex the ultra-high business traveler. 1) shuttle service from LAX is spotty. My last trip had to wait more than 30 minutes at LAX for the shuttle. Taxis will refuse to take you to the Gateway property because it's a minimal trip. 2) most rooms need re-design. Can't work at the desk and see the full TV screen. 3) In-room dining really needs work, starting with a more diverse menu in all categories. Often the delivered meal has problems. Very frustrating.<//Text>

<Rate>None</Rate><Text>I have stayed at this hotel a few times. This time, there was a series of errors that makes me decide not to come back!
1. When we arrived, there were three large guys in black shirts who apparently thought their job was to be a traffic cop. They stood together and did not attempt to help the guests. We came in on the shuttle and had to unload our 10 pieces of luggage ourselves (party of three).... they saw us struggle and made it a point to turn their backs on us (only 10 feet away). I challenged them asking why they can’t hrlp. They said I called the bellman! Then they laughed.
2. Only 2 of the 5 elevators were working! The wait at the elevator was 40 minutes!!!!!! Totally unacceptable!
3. The beds were the most uncomfortable we used in recent memory. In San Francisco we stayed at a Four Points property and they were the best beds we’ve had in many years. Hard to believe these two properties are part of the same group.
4. There were absolutely no management staff around to talk to. That was a first for me at a Sheraton property.
5. The room size was way too small for our Lifetime Platinum status.
6. The club lounge was terrible; overcrowded, very limited food options, staff who do t speak English, food offerings always empty and people waiting, and this place even CHARGES FOR DRINKS LIKE BEER AND WINE!

WE WONT BE RETURNING TO THIS TERRIBLE LOCATION.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I can't even begin to tell you what your staff did for us in a terrible situation.   From the shuttle driver, the front desk staff, the amazingly comfortable room, the r
bar staff to the house keepers things could not have been nicer.   Special shout outside to Stephanie(first front desk impression) Kevin (server in the bar) and Coco (front desk).  What a phenomenal experience in what could be called the most chaotic 3 days.
All of the staff at this hotel are the epitome of sheer professionalism,  kindness and humanity.   I strongly recommend this hotel for a relaxing comfortable stay</text>< pictures>

One of the worst check-in experience ever! Came to the front to drop off my 2 daughters and wife at 1230 am with 4 bags. I asked for bellboy service to assist with my luggage. They told me he will be there shortly. After 15 mins he never showed. I asked the receptionist to call him, they told me he’s outside. Went back outside to look for him, but to no avail. Waited another 20 mins, I finally gave up and asked the receptionist to watch my 2 bags so I can take 2 at a time to my room. Wasted an hour before checking in and going to my room. Receptionist was rude and unprofessional. Will never stay at this hotel again!</Review>

The shuttle took a little time to catch, but the airport is a madhouse to maneuver around.
The front desk was very helpful and brite and cheery.  The only bad experience was the wait staff at the restaurant, the only was I could explain it is to compare them to Eyore from Winnie the pooh. We will not be going there to eat again even though the food was very good, the waiter can make or break a restaurant experience.</Text>

I would say that a bit of the outdoor area is starting to look rundown, other than that a well put together hotel, and very nice rooms.  Be cautious though, the hotel is very close to the airport so you probably will hear the planes while trying to sleep.  It is close to the downtown area, and also be cautious of the traffic around the airport when heading around town.  It's location is not the best for sightseeing.</Review>

My allergies were not taken seriously. I stayed here for a 3-day event and the first meal they gave me had me recovering in my hotel room for 1&1/2 days (from a swollen face, hives, and major fatigue).

The last day of the event, I had to send my food back 2x because it looked like they seasoned it (or it was cross-contamination). Either way, it's not safe for people with allergies.

Additionally, if you like a quiet room and privacy... I can assure you that you'll be disappointed by the paper thin doors that connect the rooms.

Given I was in my room for whole day (allergies!) I heard multiple conversations from the neighbouring rooms... I had to turn on music/TV to drown out the noise.</text>

It was a great stay and very nice hotel. Unfortunately I left my iPad in the room and housekeeping seemed to have kept it. Last update being on was a few hours after I left my room. I talked to lost and found and said they didn’t find anything. I left my number and the lady I spoke with said they the manager would contact me and never did.<//review>

<Text>My stay at the Sheraton Gateway LAX from the moment I stepped into the hotel was perfect which included my check in experience by Katherine De La Torre (best front desk employee I have experienced in recent hotel check in memory). Will only stay at the Sheraton Gateway LAX when in LA!

Sister property Weston LAX could take a lesson from the team at the Sheraton Gateway! POOR customer front desk experience, will detail another time!< /Text><name>AndrewJacobs</name>< Pictures>

The check-in service and friendliness of the staff was excellent for this stay.  Maricruz upgraded my room as this was available, and provided for a better experience for my overnight stay!  The restaurant is decent, and there is a gift shop with needed items for convenience.  The location is great - close to LAX.</text>

No customer service rude employees you have to pay extra for parking. 10$ for a small bottle of water, I don't understand all these fake reviews.

Trust me stay away many better hotels plus you have to park far away from the building. This hotel doesn't even deserve 1 star for this poor quality hotel i wouldn't pay 10$ per night....</Review>

<review>I stayed here for 3 nights/4 days for a conference that my company was hosting. For my first big event, the hotel staff and gym helped ALOT!! ESTELLA, who helped us in the Board Room, was so sweet, professional, and accommodating. The whole staff from the front desk, to housekeeping was  professional and friendly. The beds are a bit uncomfortable and too soft, as well as the pillows.< /review>< Pictures>

Hotel seems to be losing their focus. I've stayed here before and enjoyed my visit. This time the toilet had not been cleaned in our room, there were short hairs on our duvet, the bedsheets had a tear and the air vent rattled at night. Asked for balsamic at the restaurant and got soy sauce in a balsamic bottle. Found out after I'd poured it over my meal. Staff seemed disinterested when I noted these issues at checkout. Not sure I can recommend it anymore.< /review>

Always a wonderful stay at this hotel. Centrally located and close to everything downtown. Quick and efficient valet parking. Great food options within the hotel. Kind and helpful staff. The rooms are always impeccably decorated, minimal, and functional. We had a room with a small patio and fantastic view of the downtown skyline.</review>

We were upgraded to an "executive suite" which had a badly broken down bed.  The club lounge is limited in usefulness as it has no evening offerings such as yogurt or other snacks one can take to one's room for an early morning departure.  Also there was no bar in the lounge when we did a walk-through, unlike all other club lounges we have enjoyed.  And the lobby bar served us well drinks instead of the brands we had requested.  I noticed the taste was not what I ordered, and when I asked the bartender who had make my drink, he replied that they did not have my brand.  But he charged me for that brand!< /text>

*PRO
The Room was nice, very clean and professional.

*CON
The service of the restaurant is really slow; It took around 15 minutes to get my drink, i even got my food first, i had to get out from my table and and asked for my drink.
The price is high(understandable),
But the place is nice.</Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>First night was kept up from 11pm-2am with partying and huge groups of people coming in and out of the rooms. The doors are extremely thin and you can hear EVERYTHING in the halls. Even just regular conversations in the halls sound like they are inside your room. Called desk 4 times and nothing was ever done and they didn’t seem to care. Pool was closed to kids for an adult party and that was very loud. 2nd night was woken up again around 2am to someone knocking on the door across the hall obsessively for 15 min straight. You can seriously hear even the doors opening and closing next to you and across from you. Have never experienced the horrible noise in a hotel like this before. It was awful, never will stay here again.<//Review><userid>100926975290658078984</userid></record></dataset><record>

I returned to this hotel for 7 nights, based on the reasons I stated in my previous review. This time I was upgraded to an Executive Suite on the club floor, next to the elevators.

Note - the Executive “Suite” is not an actual separate-bedroom suite, but is a larger suite with an extended seating area for hosting perhaps 5-10 people in your room… as they stare at your bed.

Proximity to the elevator wasn’t an issue, I didn’t hear any noise, but this time I was facing the end of the north LAX runway, and did hear the planes a lot more. Primarily because the runway ends before the hotel, so jets spooling up their engines are directing the backwash/sound towards the hotel windows. Honestly, it didn’t bother me too much.

Hotel has undergone some renovations, and staying longer this time I took more advantage of the pool and the gym, appreciating those facilities. The gym now features one of those “vibrating” machines, but I couldn’t make heads or tails of how to use it.

Lounge continued to be excellent for breakfast and evening snacks, although every morning I took advantage of the Starbucks in the lobby before heading to the office.

I took more advantage of room service for working evenings as well, and the menu is the same from every Sheraton, with it’s healthy choices options. Food was always delivered quickly and as ordered, and certainly delicious! Even ordering pizza twice was simple, although I had to visit the lobby to pick it up as the club level is only accessible by keycard.<//text>

<Text>I had to be in the LAX vicinity for a few nights and I decided to spread my stays between the Westin LAX and the Sheraton Gateway. Before visiting either hotel, I had a preconceived notion that the Westin would be better, but after having now stayed at both I can attest that the Sheraton Gateway is by FAR the better option.

Check-in:
Prompt and courteous. There was a dedicated line for Marriott/SPG Elite members. As a Marriott Platinum Elite, I was upgraded to an Execute Suite and had lounge access.

Room:
The Executive Suite I stayed in was large, modern, and practically laid out. There were two TVs, a dining table, and sofa. Enough connectivity and USB outlets for me to do my work. My only complaint was how there wasn't enough insulting my room and the connecting room next door; I could hear a phone conversation from the person next door word-for-word. Part of this problem, I imagine, could be alleviated by the hotel installing door sweeps.

Club lounge:
Among the various Sheraton Clubs and executive lounges I've visited in North America, the Sheraton Gateway ranks among the best. The lounge was huge, with plenty of varying types of seating and more private areas to venture off to. During the day, the lounge was well stocked with beverages and fruit and snacks (chips, nut mix, etc.)

The highlight however was evening hors d'oeuvres - the hotel doesn't hold back in offering a more than decent number of hot and cold options. One night they had salmon penne pasta and finger foods, while another night (which happened to be Thanksgiving!) they did the holiday justice by laying out sliced turkey and stuffing.

I also have to mention the lounge attendants, who were extremely professional, friendly, and attentive.

Breakfast/Brasserie restaurant:
I had the breakfast buffet at the hotel's Brasserie restaurant. I would give it a solid 9/10. There was a good amount of options (the usual eggs, pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausage, etc.) as well as options like congee and potstickers.

Gym/Pool:
I used the gym and had a chance to look at the pool area. The gym was large and was well equipped with several cardio and weight machines. The pool area was clean and had free cabanas that you could rest on. This gave things a nice "Hollywood" feel - almost like you were staying in a downtown LA hotel.</Text>< time>

It doesn't feel like an airport hotel, the public spaces are well designed and comfortable. The guest room decor and design is very good. I travel a lot and stay in probably 30-40 hotels a year. I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel and would definitely stay here again.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><UserId.>None</UserId.>< name>

Sheraton do not provide free parking. The price of parking is really high, and you have to pay every time you go out and come back. Besides, the front desk is rude to customers.< /text>

<text>The hotel was recently renovated and is classy and modern. The staff are friendly and helpful. The food is very good, with a variety of food outlets at different price points. The location is excellent and centrally located if you need to be close to the airport, but also want access to the coast or downtown LA. I travel a fair amount and I'm very picky about hotels, but this one exceeded my expectations. I also appreciated the refrigerators in the rooms, with a microwave in the same space as the ice machine.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Convenient hotel very close to LAX with free shuttle running back and forth to the airport. I travel to downtown quite a bit and stay at this airport whenever rooms are sold out there. Nice large rooms with modern decor. Clean bathrooms round out the room. Club lounge with breakfast for those with access.</review>

<Text>Stayed here twice over the past year.  Horrible experience in both.  First, I booked 2 nights with them last year through a third party and when I checked in somehow it wasn't in their system despite me having the confirmation number.  Only thing they said they were able to do was for me to book another room on the spot for an insane rate.  It was very late and I decided not to bother looking for another hotel, ended paying 500$ for one night and had to hunt down the third party for a refund.

Decided to give them a second chance as the first time, it could be the third party website that messed up.  This time, I booked in on their website.  Came in to check in late into the night seeing theres 2 agents on the front desk; a long line of their Marriot Members and only 2 non members.  They were only checking in Marriot Members (these people were just flooding in) and us and the other "non member" were just standing there a waiting for 20 minutes despite us coming in way before most of the members.

Got the room, tired and grumpy.  Called the guest service for some toiletries, and below is our conversation:

Me: hi, are you able to bring up 2 sets of toothbrush and toothpaste to our room?
Agent: 2?
Me: 2 please
Agent: K *hangs up*
-A TOTAL OF 2 WORDS?? not sure if im grumpy or, but that is not great customer service in my opinion.

When the house keeping person came up to bring the toiletries, not a single word spoken, he just hand me the toothbrush and toothpaste and left.

Alright Sheraton *clap clap*</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Friendly staff and courteous service. However, travocity needs to be clear that the 75$ deposit is not included when room is booked. Could have been a disaster but for a friend who stepped in.<//Review>

We upgraded to the sheraton club floor and lounge access, this was amazing as it came with afternoon snacks such as fruit and cheeses as well as breakfast. The gym was awesome and very modern. Highly recommend< /review>

<Review>The staff was friendly and made me feel at home, great service all around. The room was clean  and tidy, from check-in to departure great experience. Have stayed there for years and do miss a good stakehouse like Shullas. But other than that will always stay at Shearaton Gateway LAX</Review>< username>

< Review>
Room had been updated with walk in shower.  Bed was comfortable and TV had high definition quality.  Avoid the Breakfast buffet unless it is part of room price because for $33 after tip it is a poor value.  Food was not hot.  Scrambled eggs too wet.  The cereal choices did not include any healthy choices.  The Bagels we're not sliced to all for toasting.  The coffee was hot and the service excellent.  Order off the menu.  It may be just as much but it will be hotter.< /Review>

<text>Super soft pillows and all around comfortable stay. Very clean room and the restaurant and bar stays open until 1am. I thought the prices were a bit steep , but I was starving and needed something in my belly. I had the ribs with mac and cheese.

I was very impressed by the Sheraton Gateway, convenient and easy to reach from LAX. Service and amenities were great. Made for a very comfortable stay during my trip to Los Angeles. The location made access to and from the airport very simple and a good central location for travel around the city. I’ll be back again in the future..</Review>

Everything was excellent at the hotel. 
 Room was spotless staff was friendly... But the parking is ridiculous !! They don't have their own parking area so you either have to pay an extremely high valet or park way in back of the hotel in a public lot and pay every time you go in-and-out !! Not a daily rate , but every time you leave its another $17...It was so frustrating to have my husband drop us off and go looking for parking after a long day.  Plenty of guest were complaining about parking.</review>

<Text>I decided to book this hotel as it was hosting a training I was scheduled to attend. The experience with the booking should've indicated that this would not be a pleasant stay. I booked through the hotel website and immediately found a better rate on another site. I filed a Best Rate claim through the hotel and had to battle to get it approved. Every staff member I encountered seemed to be in a rush and unable to attend to customer needs. As a result, 3 out of 3 meals I ordered in the restaurant were either incorrect or undercooked. One of the meals took over 45 minutes to come out and was undercooked. Not to mention that the hotel was totally unprepared to accommodate dietary restrictions. Our conference room was freezing everyday and could not be adjusted for comfort level beyond turning it off or on. The wifi situation was a frustration. There were 3 different connections: the rooms, the conference rooms and the lobby. And they often didn't stay connected. I contacted front desk to request something from housekeeping and as I was speaking, the woman hung up on me. Lastly, the floor I was on was quite noisy and I got the joy of listening to my neighbor's verbatim conversations through the wall. When I totaled up what I spent on this trip just on Starwood alone (hotel, parking, food, etc.) the value was just not there. I wish I would've stayed elsewhere and taken a taxi to the training. Along with other training attendees I have contacted the training provider requesting they find another location that is more customer friendly and cost effective. I can neither recommend this hotel nor say I would stay again.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This hotel provided a great little dedicated and well maintained area for dogs, complete with lush grass, plastic bag dispenser and bins. Can't say that for all pet friendly accommodation. Great room and also appreciated the office facilities and enjoyed the economy and convenience of twice daily buffet feeds at the Club hub on the 15th floor. Designed a lot like a Departure Lounge, Airplane nerds will love this venue for 24/7 plane watching!< /review>

I love coming to stay at the Sheraton Gateway in LAX. All but one customer service rep makes your experience something to brag about! When you pull in Mike at Valet makes you fee welcomed with taking great care of your valet needs and vehicle whether a Rolls Royce or a Toyota Prius. Juana, Evelyn, Monica and a few others (I wish i remembered there names) make your check in experience everything. The only person who makes it horrible is Maricruz with her horrible customer service! Orlando and Mark are awesome as well. If we tighten up the weak link i think this will be the all around perfect hotel!</Text>

I should add that the beds were comfortable. The staff seems nice aswell. The suprise parking cost was ridiculous though. The constuction started super early and the room is facing that way. The pool was closed down for whatever reason. Also the bathwater got warm but definitely not hot enough to have a hot bath. You can have a warm one. Maybe its just this room its possible parts of the hotel get better water idk.< /review>

My room on the club level put me close to food, water, coffee and the services I needed to check-in, work, sleep, teach, return and freshen up before getting on the plane.

I stayed at the Sheraton for six nights with my four year who would have liked to get a view of the city but instead recieved a view of the rooftop . Also my account/ checkout information was miscounculated countless amount, during this time I had to call guest services and be transferred. The roof was amazingly comfortable, food was great and employees were kind. If I would have stayed with out these minor problems... it would have made a huge difference.< /review>

<text>A good night's sleep is so important when traveling. So often, airport hotels are noisy due to loud ventilation and heating systems, as well as airport noise. There are rooms in the hotel that do not face the runways, and can be requested. AC/Heating unit also very quiet. Nicely redone property. Staff excellent!< /text>< rate>

It's clean and their staff is extremely helpful and friendly. Their pool is actually pretty nice and they have a gym that faces the pool so it's pretty refreshing. Location is extremely convenient if you're going in and out of the airport. I would recommend it to any traveler looking for a break for a comfortable place that won't break the bank.< /Review>

<review>Reasonable rates for a high end Sheraton.  Very modern rooms that are tastefully decorated. WIFI works great and reasonably speedy. Staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. If you look like you are looking for something they step right up to ask if they can help.  A very nice outdoor pool area that has nice shaded areas along with cabanas. Food and drink service extends to the pool area. The lobby bar has a great selection of local craft beers, wines and the staff are adept at making your favorite cocktail. The food keeps with the theme with a range of tasty small plates or you can order full meals from the restaurant and have them served to you in the bar.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1538753359657, 'text': 'Thank you for your compliments of our property and services, Neil.

I stayed over 2 nights.  Overall a nice hotel only reason I'm giving it this rate is because I had an issue the last day and I wanted to talk to a manager and I waited 20 minutes in the front desk without a manager showing up. I asked the front desk to please have manager contact me, I wan't contact by manager. This place doesn't take their clients serious if they make someone wait that long.< /Review>

Super close to LAX and a great place to stay. Exceptional service and location for business. I love that there is a Starbucks in the lobby, because it’s a great way to start your day. The rooms at Overlook Los Angeles international airport can be a little bit loud, and I prefer the rooms that phase away from the runways. They have a nice bar here that serves hors d’oeuvres and a very nice pool outdoors.< /text>

Overall was ok to stay for a night near to the airport 
But the room had a smell of damp
And the toilets were not fit to have a bath
No water in the shower.
Shuttle service was very excellent< /Text>

Had quite a pleasant stay at this Sheraton location! The room was perfect for my friend and myself. Got to enjoy the pool and hot tub, and then came in for a bite to eat at the bar. There's a nice nightlife atmosphere and we ran into a couple of celebrities which was pretty cool. Parking is $40 a night. Hyatt had parking for $15 a night and there were other garages across the street. They sell out so book in advance. The breakfast was great, but not free. Buy a breakfast voucher with your room, or it will be $28 a person as a walk in. 100% will stay here again.</Text>

< Review>
Do NOT stay at this hotel. I had a late check in (1 am) and I had to stand in a long line of people trying to book rooms that did NOT have a reservation. I needed to stay close to the airport and I choose this hotel because it was more expensive and very nice looking. However, it did NOT give me comfort. Once I finally was able to check in (past 2 am) I did NOT get any sleep. They put me next door to a group that was partying until 6 am. What a terrible experience.< /Review>

Newly remodeled rooms a big improvement! No tub, but a new shower. I was especially happy with the bed linen. Very clean, crisp & comfortable.
A long wait for the shuttle but the staff at check-in were very accommodating, as were the valet guys. I was also pleased with their long term parking, and valet guys. It was a busy time so there was a spike in the prices. A week earlier the room cost less.<//text>

<Text>The hotel and the view are absolutely beautiful. The rooms are comfortable. The Internet is fast. The shower is a little tight for more than one person, but it's lovely. A pretty view of the skyline. The food is over priced but the quality is spot on and I was satisfied with spending around 60 a day. The staff are lovely and if you park your own vehicle the lot is large and close. The shuttle to the airport is also a lovely convenience. Highly recommend.<//Text><user_name>Majesty Superbia</user_name><user>107155505543752339869< /user>< rating>

The airline cancelled our flight so we got a free accodomation there and we are very thankful for it. The tourism table however, very unsatisfied , as we told them we're on limited time and we want to see Hollywood and Beverly Hills during the day. The tour guide came late, didnt follow the outline on the brochure that were given to us, wasted two hrs in Los Angeles poor areas with homeless people on the streets. By the time we got to Hollywood it was night, you couldn't see the sign and we only had short amount of time to walk there. Beverly Hills was closed as well, all their stores were closed. Such a waste of $140 dollars USD we paid for two of us. And it's shady cuz they wanted cash only!< /Review>

Hotel is conveniently located near LAX.  The free shuttle is a great convenience.  The on-site restaurant is also a plus.  The food is excellent.  Meeting rooms are conveniently located on-site as well.  Swimming pool is a plus but, we didn't have time to try it out.  Elevators are always quick.  The robot that brings stuff to your room (things that you might have forgotten, like a toothbrush, etc..) is interesting.  I'd stay at this hotel again if I were to travel to Los Angeles on business again.<//review>

What a terrible hotel. We split 2 rooms in 5 family members. Both rooms bathrooms didn't have an exhaust. For a room with 3 folks, you can't get ready in the morning with bath door open for privacy reasons, so it was a pain to get ready and leave in the mornings.  The staff was not accommodating about this and I am sure the checkout lady laughed away my problem saying, I will report this to our engineer. Wow. Terrible experience.</review>

I made my reservation to spend the night before picking up my son from LAX early in the morning. Little did I know two months ago that I would have experienced two weeks of evacuation from the Thomas Fire before my trip down to LA. I was already nervous when I arrived after driving in LA traffic and when I got to the reception desk realized I had lost my credit card most likely at The Grove. They held on to my bags and directed me to my bank only 6 minutes away. It took an hour but I returned with my new card and checked it. They gave me a drink ticket for the bar. After taking my things to the room I planned to go have a well deserved drink. The room was such a surprise, very large, spotless, no awful cleaning supplies smell, and well appointed. The bar is lovely and the kind bartender made me the best martini! I can't get over how great the food is too. Had a wonderful night's sleep and they gave me a free breakfast coupon. The buffet has everything you'd want at a buffet. My son arrived on the Shuttle and off we went North. I would never stay anywhere else when at LAX! FYI I had just stayed at one of the Big Four on Nob Hill in SF and this was a better hotel!< /text>

I enjoyed my stay at this hotel! Great service! The front desk staff went above and beyond to accommodate me and my guest. We even got a free upgrade to a suite with free wifi since it was my birthday! Room was wonderful and we actually received fresh linen for our bed. The only complaint I have is our room key all of sudden stopped working on us after leaving it in our pockets away from our cellphones. It happened 4 times. I think they should fix that issue. Overall, great stay! Highly recommend!</Review>

The lines were Super long. I guess there was an event taking place.My friend who booked it, is a premier member and they gave us a room with a view to the parking Garage and that wasnt what she booked..The staff was just there and didnt really do anything. The upgrade, no complimentary parking, no food or beverage,just nothing. The pool was Unavailable due to an event there were having.We went to get our car only from the valet,the person who we gave our keys to actually Misplaced it. 😒. We were only staying for one night. Appearance-wise it was clean and whoever designed it had taste. I expected more from this hotel.<//review>

I normally stay at Marriott hotels. But two of the last times I stayed at hotels in the past year, I stayed in Sheratons in different cities. The Sheratons felt like I remember luxury hotels used to feel.  It seems Marriott hotels lost that. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were very nice and clean and the beds were very comfortable. The linen felt of high quality as well (the Marriott bed/linen experience is the same).  The place made me want to dress up rather than dress down.  I plan on staying at Sheratons more  than Marriott brands in the future as much as possible.<//text>

After a stressful evening re-organising a flight home, we booked a night at the Sheraton Gateway - our expectations for an airport hotel weren't particularly high, however we were very impressed, the service, cleanliness and amenities were faultless, which turned out to be a perfect stress free end to our holiday in the States.....and a special mention to the Shuttle Bus driver.<//Text>

<text>I stayed here one night and want to pay room charge with cash. When I checked-in yesterday I checked it is possible to pay with cash or not, counter said it's OK. So I only deposited by card. But this morning 9:00 AM I can not pay with cash. Because counter person says that she can't cancle card-deposit, only manager can do that. But manager is not there, will be 10:00 AM. I can't wait manager cause of my flight time. So I have to pay by credit card not with cash. Yesterday they said 'paying with cash is OK' but Today they say 'paying with cash is IMPOSSIBLE'. I feel bad this morning.<//text><Resp>{'time': 1565453716882, 'text': "We're terribly sorry to hear of your billing issue, Sedong.

<text>Really nice rooms, nice fancy lobby, restaurant was decent, location is insanely close to the airport so their free shuttle is great... you can't even get to a rental car faster, staff mostly friendly but not amazingly helpful with problems... there was no hot water for showers one morning and you'd think they would offer something when guests bring this up... 500 pts? Coffee? Still overall it was a good stay.

Edit: they contacted me after writing this review and offered points for the inconvenience... So in my book that gets the fifth star back.<//text>< pics>

The hotel is great. Super nice, clean, quiet, decent club room. However the restaurant was pretty bad. Food was mediocre, not even close to what they were charging for it. The service was abysmal, there was about a 1:1 ratio of guests to staff (I went at a slow time) and everything took forever. When I asked for the check, it took them over 20 minutes to complete that simple task. I'd stay here again, but avoid the restaurant.< /Text>

I requested a toothbrush set because in the lobby their is an advertisement that the "hotel robot" will bring anything to your door of simple toiletries. The instruction is to call the front desk and they will arrange. I called and they told me I could come down to the lobby if I wanted anything, I mentioned the robot and they said they were very busy... So why do you advertise this, and don't give an explanation because you are busy?? Really inattentive staff and maybe because they had a conference, but you can 't make excuses in any case. If you need more staff, hire them. There was a conference but does that mean we should expect bad service every time there is a conference there? I would not recommend this Sheraton to any business traveler. I was also not informed by the bell staff that there was a self park option as they had the hotel entrance set up for valet parking only... I found out from another guest. I also requested the hotel to refund me the valet fee but that isn't resolved yet. Other than this the hotel was good.<//text>

They charged me three times for one room, counted the other two as no-show, refused to refund me and refused to move forward with the investigation. When they gave me the receipt when I checked out, it shows only one room's charge so I wasn't even aware I was charged in extra. When I called to make the correction, they redirect me to accounting who almost never pick up and phone and kept telling me they are doing 'investigations' and stopped picking up the phone. This is the worst hotel experience I have ever had.<//text>

<Review>After reading some of the other reviews here, I was very nervous about staying at this property and would have cancelled if I had still been within the time period to cancel without penalty. Am I glad I didn’t!! Check-in was very efficient and easy. Parking valet attendants were friendly. The room was well appointed with what appeared to be new furnishings. When I called room service, I was greeted by name. Our food was hot and prepared correctly. We were not bothered by any noise in the hallways or adjacent rooms. When we left for the airport, there were two shuttles waiting; the drive to the airport was accomplished in under 10 minutes. All in all, a very pleasant stay, I will definitely stay here again when I need to fly out of LAX.<//Review>< Resp>

Walking in the hotel has a nice feel to it. Not much storage for the room my party stayed in. Also was short on towels. Overall though it was accommodating. Looking forward to trying the robot that delivers items you may have forgotten, such as toothpaste, to your room.< /Text>

Awesome place- we got a king suite and it’s huge! Staff are really helpful and i got the $25 a day upgrade for the Sheraton club that comes with breakfast& appetisers- definitely worth it. It was my partners birthday and we got a complimentary delivery of wine and food for him which was so lovely. The only thing I could ask to improve on is the speed of service- I had to ask for room Service 3 or more times every time I ordered something and it took about 4 + hours each time for it to come. Same with fixing my room key to the Sheraton club, took a few hours to get done. Other than that- amazing place thank you</Text>

I chose this hotel from my past Sheraton experiences had always been excellent. Upon arrival same excellent service, until I got to the room.
The room I was given was very noisy
I heard everything from people, doors to the planes etc. once I finally was able to fall sleep I was woken up by a bellman who had the wrong room.
I would not chose the Bloody Mary either this was the worst drink I have ever had tomato juice with a celery stock horrible.
Sadly 4:00 am comes early so much for a good nite sleep before catching a flight<//review>

I booked this hotel to catch my flight.  Free shuttle bus was frequently and the hotel is just next to the central bus station where you can take the bus to San Monica or down town.  Breakfast was great with wide varieties and options.  The room was comfortable and spacious.<//Text>

Convenient location to LAX and rental car hire depots. Room was clean, fresh and contained all the expected amenities. Room service menu and quality of food was excellent however expensive. Self parking a only short walk away and secure.</Review>

Visit in November 2018 Awesome place to stay rooms are very nice and their beds are so comfortable love staying there!! Only issue parking is extremely expensive $39.50 per day no discount even by u staying there so parking gets a one star.  I love this hotel but as of Jan 2019 now they are charging a ridiculous $350 cleaning fee on top of your hotel stay charge.  This hotel has become from a 5 star to a 1 star.< /Review>

<Rating>None<//Rating><review>I typically opt to stay at other SPG properties, when I need to be near LAX. Just "because"...I decided to give the Sheraton Gateway at LAX a try. The remodeled lobby and rooms are ultra modern, yet cozy. SPG recognition was very good, and the Front Desk Staff, were nothing short of great! Nice Club Lounge, too! It was a brief stay, but a good one. The only thing I noted was the hallway leading to our room needed a good vacuuming. (Perhaps a "partying group" on our floor, but it was a bit of an eyesore). Overall, loved it!< /review>< Pictures>

<text>The staff was incredibly friendly. It is an older building so there isn't any air conditioning but we were fine without it. Our room was beautiful, had a nice wood burning fireplace. Everything looked modern and clean. I believe they remodeled not long ago. The gentlemen at the front desk was so helpful. He gave us great directions, since it was our first time. You are right in the middle of union square so there is much to see and do close by. The only negative i have is there was no complimentary breakfast on Sunday when we got up. I checked both the 2nd and 4th floor as I was told and there wasn't even coffee out. That was a bummer, but overall we had a great time. We would definitely stay again!<//text><gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</gmap_id>< name>

The hotel is pretty good, overall my stay was pretty nice the place is calm the staff is very kind and always helpful
my room was always clean and I had everything I need.
The only inconvenience with this location is the parking lot, the location doesn't have a parking lot of its own so you have to pay a daily rate and park at a lot behind the property which is inconvenient if you have a family or kids; the hotel does offer valet parking lot with an extra fee.<//Text>

Very much enjoyed our two-night stay. Checkin/checkout professionally and efficiently handled by Mustafa and Tammy, who were welcoming and extended Platinum recognition. Small maintenance issue in our junior suite was rapidly taken care of by the friendly and capable Pedro Gonzalez from engineering. Club Lounge was nice (but you MUST extend breakfast hours to ease severe overcrowding in the 15 min before closing!), and, as always, Juan and Sharon (AM) and Heidi (PM) were a delight. Buffet breakfast in the dining room was ample and delicious, and Hector provided flawless, friendly service. You must be excited over your renovation, and we look forward to returning soon!<//review>

< Review>
After reading so many amazing reviews I was confident that  I booked  an incredible5 day   stay at the Sheraton LAX and couldn't wait to check in after my long 6 hour flight from NJ. Unfortunately I was highly disappointed when I arrived. See below a list of my disappointments

-Although I booked a king bed and paid premium to make sure I was comfortable I was assigned a Queen bed. I called the front desk and they claim the Queen bed  is their version of King bed. I was beyond frustrated because at the time I was pregnant and had to share the bed with my toddler and husband. In addition they should not advertise king bed if it's Queen bed

- I found a bottle of sunflower seeds in an old Gatorade bottle under the bed

- the toilet seat was never cleaned when I arrived and looked dirty. It was very obvious.

- I ordered room service and one movie for the first night. The hotel had the audacity to charge my card $500 the next morning. When I inquired about the reason for this outrageous charge they claimed they assumed I will
Order everyday  for my entire stay and they estimated $500 based on the fact that my intial bill was $100 and I was booked for 5 days

- the morning buffet has no variety is over priced.

Overall my experience has turned me completely off and I will never ever ever recommend this hotel. I couldn't wait to go back home. I traveled to go to a wedding and I didn't realize it was All star weekend so all of the hotels were booked and I couldn't change at last minute without paying over $2500 for 5 days Worst mistake ever</Review>

BEWARE, this is a 2-3 star hotel at most! It might meet some vague criteria to be called a "4 star hotel", but the quality of the hotel does not live up at all.

4.	Service:
Poor signage outside and no associates outside to explain where to park or explain anything.
The staff inside seem more interested in their personal conversation or phone than customer service.

5.	Décor:
The outside looks ghetto with cars randomly parked everywhere including along every curb and filling up any open piece of pavement even if it is not an actual parking space just so the hotel can maximize ability to valet cars and get more money.
The lobby looks ransacked as its practically empty with no furniture or art. The carpeting is dingy.
I got off on the 4th floor to what seemed to also be very dated carpeting and wallpaper. There was an attempt to cover up the smell of smoke in the walls/carpeting but ultimately made it worse.

6.	The room
Yes it was big, and it wasnt disgusting, but everything about it seemed cheap. It was subtle at first, but Pieces of furniture didnt line up well, the lamp shades were dirty, most pieces of furniture were a fake wood/plastic with peeling laminate.< /Text>

<text>Family had camped on the Rose Parade route New Year's Eve and we had a red eye out on 1 Jan. We booked a room to just have someplace to shower and relax before the flight. Although we were only in the room about 4 hours, it was so nice to have a comfortable bed and a hot shower before heading. We are platinum and they upgraded us to a suite so we had plenty of room.

Great experience at a Sheraton as always!</text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>None< /rating><review>Overall the hotel experience including bar, amenities and restaurant was extremely good but all of this gets somewhat lost because of one barking dog next door when I was trying to sleep.  Staff offered to move me but why not move the dog instead?Or maybe owners should not be allowed to leave their precious comfort or service dogs in the room.  After all, don't they insist on bringing them because they need to be in their proximity?  I know the real problem is society's mass insanity over pets and that is not Sheraton's fault.  When you lose sleep, you lose perspective  and blame everyone including hotel management.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d< /GmapID></record>

The hotel was nice. The meeting rooms too cold, the food in the restaurant was OK. The restaurant service was sorely lacking which was a BIG disappointment. Couldn't get refills & took over 20mins to get the check after asking 4 times. The manager tired to make up for it but the offer was for the day that we were checking out & after 4pm. Really?<//Review>

Excellent continental breakfast and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. Only thing that could use improvement is the staff at the front desk.

My stay at the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles Hotel was excellent. I was there for a seminar that was very long with short breaks and a short lunch and the waiter I had understood this and got my order, then my food, then my check quickly. And the food was very good. I have two complaints and that is that the buffet breakfast is overpriced  the television did not have HBO. 

The  buffet was good and a fair diversity but still overpriced. My room was always cleaned before our first break. The staff was very friendly and helpful.
Flying today is miserable at best. So, having an excellent hotel waiting for my arrival was a treat!<//text>

I was upgraded to a larger room and I enjoyed the time a the club lounge. There was plenty of warm food selection during breakfast and the attendant serving (10/5/14) was extremely helpful. She was doing everything she could to give customers the best service. The front desk staff during check-in could provide better service, no SPG recognition until I asked for a possible upgrade. The rooms are comfortable and large. Overall we had a pleasant stay<//Text>

The staff were friendly and the hotel is clean and modern. The only real down side is the food, which is horrible quality and way overpriced. We ordered room service for two guests, paid over $60 and the food was not edible. The Kung Pao Chicken was like a slimy, overcooked stew that was served over rice that tasted like it came out of a box. The salmon was served with a "shrimp fried rice" that was slimy and tasted like the shrimp were old. It was the worst food I've ever had in all the years I've been staying at hotels. I would NOT recommend the room service or restaurant.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>This hotel has the best staff and I enjoy how they pay attention to detail when it comes to remembering my name. From the time I leave the valet to the time I get to my room, I feel like a welcomed guest. Additionally in the mornings during the week in the club lounge, there is a gentleman there who always call me by my name and ensure that I am taken care of. 
I had challenges with my email and the newly appointed female manage which is well deserved took care of the issue. I thoroughly enjoy my stay every time. I have a conversation every morning with the operators when calling for my car. I think everyone should be recognized for during a tremendous job in customer service. Thanks Diana, Merly, Claudia, Rudy, Mustafa, Anca and the gentleman in the morning in the club louge!!!

<Text>I've been to many Sheraton and other hotels and usually receive great service but this location has been fairly disappointing, and below Sheraton's standards, in the majority of my stays. I'm writing to allow other members to appreciate it. The rooms are nice, and the sound isn't even bad albeit being close to the Airport. The walk is nicer and quicker than the shuttle unless you have too many bags to do it conveniently.< /Text>< user_name>

As a frequent LA visitor, I have the opportunity to stay at many Starwood properties in the LA area. This location is the best, by leaps and bounds. The proximity to LAX is great for travelers. With it's recent face lift, it is a very inviting atmosphere; whether visiting in the summer by the pool with a Mai Tai, or during the winter, next to the trendy outdoor heaters sipping a Hot Toddy. The best part of the experience starts with Robert and his crew for the service they provide at the front desk. They certainly raise the bar when it comes to information, details, requests, and SPG recognition. The warm welcome and professionalism is always the prelude to fantastic stay...every time. Quite simply, they know how to make guests happy and do great job at it.<//Text>

- continuous airport shuttles literally every 10 or 15 minutes. I don’t have to call for pick up. 
- great SPG recognition (they will upgrade you if they have a room)
- classier than most airport Sheratons (in the US) 
- club lounge service staff
- my expectations are always met

Thanks for (another) great stay!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Booked reservation through Expedia and called hotel because Expedia was not letting me cancel through there website. Front desk agent was VERY rude. Kept interrupting me and had the worst attitude. Let the front desk agent know his customer service was not too great. The front desk agent was not answering my questions and kept saying that because I booked with Expedia everything had to be done with them which I understand but I had a question regarding their policies and procedures which he didn't answer. Asked to speak with a manager and the front desk agent refused and hung up on me. Called back to speak with manager and he was great. He apologized for the inconvenience and said all the calls are recorded so he would listen to the call and coach the agent. The manager as well answered all my questions and he made my experience from horrible to not so bad. I would plan on staying here in the future but that front desk agent shouldn't work customer service if he doesn't know how to control his attitude.</Text>

Enjoyed a weekend here with my young son. Hotel was very clean and comfortable. The room was spacious enough for us and the bathroom was satisfactory. There was no tub so if traveling with very small children be sure to inquire about that if needed. We arrived at midnight and were able to still get food from the restaurant which was great. We were upgraded to the club floor which made me feel very secure since key access is needed. We were unable to access the club lounge, however our rate included breakfast in the hotel restaraunt. The breakfast buffet was somewhat limited for me, as I prefer more vegetarian options, however there was lots of fresh fruit and yogurts so I was still very satisfied. You can hear the airport from the hotel, however I didn't find this to disrupt our sleep. The location was also great; Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Downtown, Griffith Park, Runyon Canyon, and Beverly Hills were all less than an hour away.<//review>

I have stayed at this hotel almost 10 times in the past month when I come into town for business/pleasure. I have stayed at higher end more expensive hotels in the past while in LA and have completely been won over by this hotel. The best feature of the hotel is the staff. The front desk staff is very fast with checking you in and they are very friendly as well. Jose is wonderful at the front desk, very professional and polite. He knows exactly was good customer service means. The valet parking is full of warm faces who get your car promply and welcome you back every time with a smile. I loved the convenience of having Starbucks in the lobby where I would go daily and they also have a great staff! Another feature important to me that was a highlight was the gym. It was very clean, full of good equipment and being open 24hours is another bonus. Pool area is also very nice. Room service food was excellent as well.< /Text>

Welcoming, accommodating and incredibly comfortable, my stay for 4 days was great! Convenient location to airport, beaches, and business, this Sheraton took care of all my needs and exceeded expectations in wonderful ways. The concierge lounge was terrific and so worth the extra money with a beautuful continental breakfast++ and a great place to come enjoy hearty appetizers and a glass of wine at the end of the day. Service was top of the line. A don't want to miss is their restaurant Papparazzi where we had the most delicious tasting menu filled with fresh contemporary Italian dishes presented beautifully and paired with amazing wines. A great run hotel with top level service in every way!<//text>

I have stayed at this hotel for some 20 years plus! So I have seen the changes. And while some are good, some needs improvement. The 2 major areas are by the house keepers noise in the morning, and the breakfast buffet. On my last visit at around 8:20 am i was awoken to the house keeper knocking on all the doors of the rooms nearby "housekeeping-housekeeping" That needs to stop or at least not start until after 10 am. We are in the 21st century folks, have a report that shows rooms are checked out or vacant! The other area is the breakfast buffet. At $28 it is overpriced and should have additional items for kosher dieters like salmon lox. You will do better by selling that buffet at $19.

! will say that other than those 2 areas the hotel is excellent and the staff goes abaove and beyond to help. I will continue to recommend this hotel and look forward to staying again soon.< /Text>

I had a beautiful room on the 9th floor for a 3 day 2 night Christmas get a way. It is the last Christmas with our daughter as a teenager before she leaves for college. Her words precisely! We were very happy with our nonsmoking room until our room was flooded with cigarette smoke from a neighboring room. My daughter has asthma and it became very uncomfortable. My husband said that it would be okay. He left for the front desk to report our situation and it was not 10 minutes before he was back with keys for our new room. What service. They accommodated us as soon as possible. I was shocked that it was so fast. We spent Christmas eve and Christmas in our beautiful room. We had a wonderful holiday and the smoking won't even make it to our holiday memories. We will be back Thanks Sheraton Ocean Gate!!!!<//Text>

<Text>Nice rooms, comfortable beds, nice relaxing pool area and good food. The cons, room not that clean we found food under the bed, also you might have new guests coming in before you check out. They need a system to make sure rooms are empty and clean before assigning them to new customers.<//Text>< userid>

Great beds, room & silence, could have been a easy five stars but the last night we stayed there, our baby got sick and puked in one of the beds. Since we had a long flight the next day we did have to go the hospital to get it check out and on the way out I told the bell services to please replace the sheets and clean the bed. Got back from the hospital at 4 am in the morning and had to sleep in the corner of the puked bed, which was untouched.< /review>

hote was very comfy. The beds are sogood! Definitely a busy hotel however they definitely keep up and track of ensuring they get you what you need (house keeping). Club level is definitely worth it. Definitely would recommend!</Text>

The free shuttle there was quick and courteous, the concierge attentive and engaging, and the room was clean and inviting. Loved my entire short visit. Only marks against were the down computer during checkout and the strong smell of cigarette smoking from another room on a non-smoking floor, both out of the control of the hotel to be fair. I recommend the hotel based on my experience.<//review>< Resp>

<text>Beautiful hotel and amenities. Convenient for staying before or after a flight out of LAX. Nice pool area and great lounge with a wide variety of food choices.

Back in December 2018 my wife was making reservations at Sheraton next to Universal City. During this process she noticed she made a mistake and had reservations at wrong location. We called location and spoke with management who said too bad for you we will take your money because our policy states no refunds. So thank you for taking my money without staying there crooks!!<//Text>

WARNING. AVOID THE ROOMS WITH HAVE ADJOINING DOORS. YOU CAN HEAR EVERYTHING YOUR NEIGHBOUR SAYS. EVEN WITHOUT THIS WALLS ARE NOT INSULATED VERY WELL. 

Hotel has been completely renovated and the rooms are great as are the staff, but one thing I noticed during my stay is the hotel sales team are focused on large groups. In this case, you convention goers who as would any young person be focused on the meeting in the day and partying at night. I got a great upgrade to a suite, but what I did not realize was the room had an adjoining door. Well I can honestly say it was the worse case of sound transfer I have ever had in a hotel anywhere in the world. The noise began at 8pm. Teens running up and down the halls, screaming. Running into each others rooms. Then the adjoining room became party central. I put up with it until 10pm then called the front desk. I must have called 10 times and only twice did they actually answer. I let the call ring a FULL 5 MINUTES on one occassion and no one picked up. This was 11pm so I went down to the front desk. I expressed my unhappiness with the situation and wanted to move to another room but there were no rooms left that did not have this adjoining feature. Why for the life of me the hotel during renovations did not insulate and close off these horrible noise transfering doors is beyond me. It is obviously a problem because the staff confirmed it and as I was expressing my frustration at 11pm at the front desk another woman was in tears over exactly the same situation! This is a BIG problem for this hotel and I would remedy it stat. One room at a time. Get those adjoining doors removed. The staff were clearly as frustrated as I was. They have to deal with it everyday I was told!! Imagine dealing with something they have no control over daily when the problem could be fixed by management. 
Great hotel, great staff, good location near LAX. Just make sure you avoid any adjoining rooms upgrade or no upgrade. NOT WORTH THE AGGREVATION. I also think the sales team needs to be more selective about the age groups they focus on at the hotel. It is clearly a business oriented hotel and the sales team should be focused that way and not taking anything just to fill rooms. You will lose more Platinum and Gold customers that it is worth if you continue down this path. Just sayin.</review>

<name>highlandlassie</name><Text>I stayed two nights here while in transit at LAX. Outside the arrivals area you will find the complimentary shuttle bus. Be aware though that the Sheraton doesnt necessarily have their hotel sign on the front of the bus but on the side of the vehicle. The congestion at LAX airport is horrendous so keep your eyes open for your shuttle. 
At check in there were not enough staff members to check in the guests which resulted in a 10min wait. I was allocated an adjoining room which turned out to be a nightmare. I had two very loud female neighbours who probably thought they were the only people staying on the entire floor. The soundproofing between adjoining rooms is next to nothing. I turned the A/c up to full and it helped drown out some of their noise. 
I returned again one week later but this time stayed in a Club room without an adjoining room and it made such a difference. Breakfast in the Club Lounge was adequate.
The rooms are comfortable and nicely designed. The bed was very comfortable. Complimentary bottled water is provided. The lights cannot be turned off from the bed but must be turned off indivdually which is a bit annoying. Why not have a master switch near the bed?
I had the buffet breakfast once while I stayed there but I wasnt impressed with the quality of the food. It seemed to be more about the quantity than quality. There is a Starbucks cafe located in the lobby which turned out to be the better option. I would stay here again because of the airport proximity but make sure this time that I am not allocated an adjoining room.<//Text>< Pictures>

I attended a Learning Tree training session here.  Very nice room facilities.  The daily refreshments and food cart was great.  The environment was very comfortable.

If you attend a conference here, be prepared to pay $11 a day for parking... but you wont care because your company should be picking up the tab.<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Surprisingly great, reasonably priced when I was there and with a number of convenient policies.

Quite a few things to like about this hotel. The location, which is amenable for daily car rentals if you're so inclined and so very close the airport. It's actually also quite convenient for exploring a large portion of LA. Hollywood, beaches and various museums are all with an half-hour drive. There's a selection of restaurants and fast food very close by, and it's close to the airport (an airport shuttle runs frequently).

The room we had was fairly well appointed, with logical positioning of furniture and outlets. The room had plenty of space. Washroom had plenty of space to lay out items. TV was fairly modern (although not a smart TV). Lighting was good for a hotel. The view of the runway was great for planespotting. The airplanes are largely unnoticeable once you get used to them and there's a low noise period at night which helps.

The facilities in the hotel were well maintained. A good variety of equipment in the large gym. The pool area was very convenient for those rest days and the hot tub was relaxing to lounge in. We didn't have any food in the restaurant, but the food in the lounge was excellent. During the evening there was a good selection of food which reasonably serve as dinner. The lounge itself was very beautiful and never crowded during our time there. The hotel had microwaves on every floor which was very convenient.

Service was the only area where the hotel was a little weaker, it was good but not great.

Overall, I thought that the hotel provided excellent value, and I would definitely return if I were in LA.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1556293533801, 'text': "Thank you for your five-stars, Z. Cai. We look forward to your return and we hope it's soon!"}</response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Nice room. Nice location (close to the airport). Everything clean and comfortable. Only the personnel has some serious issues it seems. Halfway my stay an employee knocked on my door asking me to leave the room. In 4 days I have been 5 times at the reception to take care of things the staff did not understand.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>The Sheraton Gateway in Los Angeles met and exceeded my expectations as one of many older "at the airport" hotels. It is what it is - a clean, comfortable, and functional place to stay before a flight. However, it is evident that management really goes out of its way to care about the comfort of guests, the condition of the facilities, and the overall enjoyment of time spent here. I will stay here again if I have another early morning flight out of LAX.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Want to check in? Plan on waiting 20 minutes and forget about any SPG benefits while waiting. 

Want to order room service? Plan on another 20 minutes to for somebody to answer the phone, then an hour and half for food.

Want to call the front desk? Don't hold your breath, as they may not answer.

Want to listen to airplanes all night? Stay at the Sheraton Gateway next door to LAX.

I stay at SPG properties over 100+ nights a year and this is hands down the most poorly run hotel in the SPG family and grossly understaffed. They don't seem to care if you ever come back.<//Review>

Beautiful hotel with friendly staff and excellent food service. I attended through a special conference comprising nearly 700 community college students.  The conference went off without any problems and it was honestly a lovely experience.

The rooms are spacious enough, with basic rooms consisting two beds, TV with a good diversity of combined channels, and if you're on the right side, excellent views of LAX.

The food provided was delicious, the lobby was beautiful and check in (normally) should be pretty speedy considering the multitude of staff on hand.  I enjoyed my time here and I definitely recommend it.</review>

This hotel has beautiful rooms, wonderful staff, and an especially modern pool area - but for anyone flying out of LAX, the location is almost impossible to beat. The front desk told me to plan for 15-20 minutes from the hotel to my terminal; however, my shuttle was pretty empty so I was there in easily under 10 minutes. As anyone who often flies out of LAX knows, traffic is extremely unpredictable, so being able to stay at a hotel that is practically on airport property is invaluable. This, in addition to the overall great experience that the Sheraton provides, makes it a property I'll definitely be returning to.</review>

<text>I want to personally recognize Brenda Reynoso. During my last visit, my family joined me. As it is summer, after my business meetings, we were taking the children to Disneyland. During our stay, my daughter left behind her beloved bear (who has been by her side since she was 9 days old). "Bear" has traveled extensively with us over the years (my daughter is now 13) and we realized he was missing upon our unpacking at Disney. After repeated calls to Sheraton Gateway housekeeping team, I was not confident that the staff had or were looking for Bear. I contacted Micheal Washinton's office and was immediately helped by Brenda Reynoso, who was understanding, and sympathetic. After 2 days of non-responsiveness from the Housekeeping team (including the Housekeeping Manager) Brenda called me back within 20 minutes of our call, with news that she believed bear to have been found. She took possession of Bear, sent a photo of him to us via text (on her own personal phone) and then set up how we could collect him. She cared and it was obvious within 3 minutes of talking to her, that she was going to help and not just fuff us off as had been the case with every other person I had spoken to prior to her. Sheraton has a wonderful, customer service oriented, employee in Brenda. She should be recognized for going beyond her duties and making an SPG Gold member and her daughter very happy. Thank you!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<review>I stayed here one night to fly out on an international flight the next day. Catching the shuttle was easy at the airport and it's was a quick ride between the hotel and airport. My room did not include breakfast and I found it a bit pricey, so opted out. I did have the pizza at the bar, but I wouldn't recommend it. It tasted like a frozen pizza, but not the good kind. The wine was good. I also noticed someone's left overs in the fridge, so the cleaning staff dropped the ball on checking this. Other than that, it was a clean and comforatable hotel, however, they do not have a microwave.<//review>< Pictures>

Very convenient hotel for business and located very close to the airport. Nice lobby, clean rooms and lots of conference rooms for events. Food at the hotel was a bit pricey but that seems to be everywhere. They get dinged a star because the shuttle from the airport to the hotel was atrocious. Just kept driving by without stopping. After watching it drive by several times over the course of 30min. I just decided to walk(about 3/4mile)< /text>

The staff appears bias toward Black people.
Not cool. This is 2019 and not 1825.

The manager on duty was of no assistance in (at the least) trying to correct the wrong and the racial profiling we were subjected to.

For security, there are two tall, heavy males who look like bouncers in a club - VERY INTIMIDATING. The guys take it at random to "softly" follow you. - I'm spending MY money here to relax & enjoy the Sheraton. Your security staff causes me to feel like I'm in some store ready to buy some goods and the employee is WATCHING my every move.

Even the bellman "appear" to be soft racist. WOW!
Could not take it anymore.
WE simply up & left on the second of our four-day stay.

I travel quite often for work and out of all of the hotels I stay in Sheraton Gateway is by far one of my favorites. It's modern and extremely clean and the staff is amazing! The food at Costero is delicious! Thank you for a wonderful stay!</Review>

<Review>While waiting on the SPG Platinum line for not even 3 minutes, the Manager came out and saw we were waiting and personally checked us in to speed things along. As someone who travels frequently and accustomed to waiting in line for check-in, this was quite impressive.

While we had an early flight and did not have time for breakfast, we did enjoy the Club floor evening snacks and there was a good selection. The Sheraton Fitness Center is also quite good at this hotel.

I also was able to return my rental car and walk just 10 minutes back to the hotel without having to take the rental car shuttle or hotel shuttle. And the valet attendant was kind to let me briefly park my rental car while checking-in so I did not have to handle any luggage.

Thanks for a terrific stay and the impressive service.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>The room seemed recently updated and was modern and classy. The view of the city and airplane takeoffs were great because of the enormous windows. The beds and pillows are luxurious and the bathroom was nicely appointed. This was honestly the nicest airport hotel I've over stayed in and would recommend it to everyone who Emmys to be extremely close to LAX and the car rental return.</Text>< pictures>

Typical airport hotel with all the usual amenities. Moderately priced room rates but suffers from the usual attempt to milk everything they provide for cash, including the $28 breakfast and the $10/day high-speed web access. However they provide a $5 coupon for each day you waive the room cleaning.< /review>

The audio/visual team for the hotel was very helpful when he came to assist me setting up. The space if pretty nice. I needed a few copies of a part of my presentation and asked the concierge desk for some direction to the business office. Instead, the concierge took my paper to the back and made copies for me. I was really grateful because he saved me about 15 minutes that I needed to prepare for my presentation.

The experience of the conference has been good so far. The location is clean and the employees have been very helpful.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>After our experience here, we wouldn't stay at a Sheraton again. The room was nice, the food was good, bed comfortable, but our reservation  was screwed up and they didn't seem to be able to unscrew it during our entire stay.  It's hard to know how
much of that was baked into their system and how much was the result of an incompetent, overly chatty front office agent, but we wouldn't take the risk again on a company that appears to appreciate it's guests and their time so little.</review>< pics>

<Review>My overall experience was good though I was only there for 1 night, my expectations for frills and thrills were very low. I did however, have high expectations for the level of comfort I'd have during the stay. My bed was comfortable absolutely no complaints there but the shower experience was definitely not to my liking. The plumbing in my room needed some TLC, I had water around my ankles and the longer the shower of course it would've continued to rise so that was cut short. Though this was a downsize it's not enough to say I wouldn't give this hotel another try.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Our stay at the Sheraton Gateway hotel was an absolute delight. Free shuttle service to and from LAX and basically a 20 minute drive (if that) to most of LA's main attractions is why we chose this hotel, and it did not disappoint. The rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable, and if you're a pet lover they even allow your pet to stay with you! I would definitely stay there again.</Text>< Pics>

Great Customer Service from front desk Jenifer (jenifer or jessica). She went above and beyond, was super friendly, and provided great customer service and was very pleasant. As a platinum 75, I stay in many hotels and she really stands out from most of the standard check in process. The hotel and rooms are comfortable and have very modern and clean looking.</Text>

I arrived late to the hotel and the valet was full. I was told I can check-in and drop my stuff off at the first desk and the. Park behind the hotel. Fine, but the parking lot is across the street and not directly behind or connected to the parking lot. I tried parking in a row that was close to the hotel and was told by a security guard I couldn’t park in that row (no signage saying otherwise) so I had to place relocate to a much further back row—again not feeling safe. Walked along the side of hotel in poorly lite area.</Text>

This hotel is close to LAX (you could walk if you wanted), our room was clean and comfortable and quiet, despite the closeness of the airport. The staff was courteous and there is Starbucks in the hotel if you want something quick for breakfast. We ate the breakfast buffet one morning which was very good with a nice variety (although no made-to-order eggs) and it was kept freshly supplied. There is a shuttle to/from airport as well. One of the best features is the fitness center - they have several treadmills, bicycles,etc. and weights and a stretching area - very nice.</Text>

Apparently, being a platinum elite member does not matter to this hotel. Mostly, the front desk showed no level of customer service towards you as a platinum elite member. From the check-in process to asking for a voucher for breakfast, there was not acknowledgement nor appreciation for being a platinum elite member.

I am hoping someone from the Sheraton chain reads this to correct this for future platinum elite members who may be booking at this hotel.

Thank you.<//text>

Convenient for early flights out of LAX. As a platinumSPG member, I appreciated the room upgrade and club access.

This hotel is just chaotic though. There is always a queue for the elevators. The lobby is noisy. Ther was garbage left out in the hallyways and room service trays that weren’t picked up. Worst of all, the guests were loud! Lots of door slamming and shouting in the hallways all night. There were “working girls” in the lobby and I saw a few in the elevatirs. The hotel should manage the people on the property better.</text>

Large hotel very close to LAX. Big, comfortable rooms. Huge reception area. Expect there to be events on in the hotel every day. On-site Starbucks. Staff very helpful and courteous. Only disappointment was the $26 'grand buffet' breakfast which lacking in choice and quality at that price.</review>

< review>
Our stay at the Sheraton Gateway was very nice. We booked a room on New Year's Eve on a whim and for the price we got much more than what we expected. The rooms are nicely appointed with modern furnishings and our view wasn't too bad on the sixth floor. The only downfall and why would not give it five stars is the prison style toilet paper they use. It's a very harsh one ply that isn't even found in a Knights Inn (I'm told). Needless to say I was thoroughly disappointed when using that very necessary product. I wouldn't subject my worst enemy that kind of abuse. Aside from that it was a very comfortable nightd sleep. The airport was unnoticeable as far as sound goes and the hotel itself is very current, clean, inviting and loaded with friendly employees including Rimbi the robot who will bring small toiletries to your room. I highly recommend this hotel keeping in mind you should bring your own toilet paper.</review>

<review>Last night I needed a hotel close to LAX and decided to stay at this Sheraton. Though the hotel is not fancy, it is clean, and up to date. What set this stay apart from the many hotels I stay in was the service. 

When I checked around 10pm I asked for an early wake up call from the front desk person. As we were chatting I also explained I needed a good night sleep, and though he had already cut keys, took them back and said, "Let's move you to the quiet side". Not facing a runway. Sure enough the room was quiet and I got a much needed couple of hours of sleep.

It ends up, I woke up on my own around 5am for an early flight. Hopped in the shower and decided I would head to the airport early and grab some breakfast in case LAX was a mess. As I am leaving my room at 5:30, who is walking towards me, but the same front desk manager. He said they had a power outage that effected the phone system so he was coming to my room to provide a personal wake up call. 

This is the type of service that will make me stay at this property next time I am in LA and need a place by the airport.< /review>< pictures>

<text>This is a great overall hotel, and clean (i am very particular about this). This was my second time here. The hotel does a good job recognizing one's Starwood Status. It is very close to the airport which is beneficial when running a tight schedule. The renovated rooms are well appointed, a good number of electrical outlets, and reasonably fast internet access. I just wish the bathroom was a little larger.<//text>< pics>

<Review>The Westin has a better bar in my opinion, but in every other area the Sheraton is the better choice. New remodel is really nice, though I was surprised to see the huge new shower drain backing up so soon after being built. They may want to check those.

<Review>The hotel rooms were spacious, very comfortable, and nicely decorated. The room included a safe and mini fridge. The desk area in the room was too crowded for me to work at. Other negatives included paid WiFi and paid parking. Valet parking is available, and there is also a paid lot behind the hotel at around $18.00 a night. The proximity to LAX is great. There is a restaurant and a Starbucks located in the hotel.< /Review><user>106466794910654097981</user><name>Jennifer Archer<//name>< rate>

<Review>Happy to see lobby renovation complete. Mrs. Pichardo at Reception was welcoming and professional, Leonardo at breakfast efficient and kind, and Nicky and Miguel provided great service in the Club Lounge. Fitness Center well-appointed. Shuttle drivers from and return to LAX efficient and helpful. Overall, great choice if you arrive on a late flight at LAX, and/or have an early departure. We look forward to our return!</Review>< Rate>

<Review>We were passing through on our way to Aspen for a ski trip so stayed at this Sheraton for two nights. The SPG recognition was okay and staff members were mostly responsive. But to be honest, unless I am traveling through the LA Airport again, I would not stay here again, for several reasons. 1) the noise level at night was unacceptable! Have they not heard of German windows? Such problems are easily fixable but the property owner obviously decided to do nothing about it. Each time a plane passes, you feel this terrible noise. Had we not been jet-legged, I wonder how we could have been able to manage any slope at all. 2) the hygiene in our room was not acceptable, especially the carpet floor. My four year old found pieces of fruits under the couch and asked me “what is this, daddy?”<//Review><Time>1519776000000<//Time><Gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</Gmap_id></record>

<Review>This was the first time I had stayed at the Sheraton Gateway and I was pleasantly surprised. Although they are going through a renovation, they have not let their cleanliness and comfort slip like other hotels I have stayed at. The room was well maintained, the bed was extremely comfortable and I received an upgrade to a huge room without additional charge. The staff were all very helpful. The amenities in the room were 5 star! The reason for the 4 stars was the price of parking! $28 a day is a bit much. Otherwise, my stay was truly perfect.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1491350400000<//Date><Rating>None< /Rating><Text>This is a FANTASTIC property. I honestly believe if this property were located downtown or in Hollywood or the West Side it would be considered one of the best hotels in LA.

The rooms have been recently remodeled and tehy did a great job. If you can get one of the corner suites, I highly recommend as they are huge, with a separate area for dining / working, living room etc... 

The lobby has been remodeled and i really like it - much airer now. 

The pool is cool. And the workout facilities are top notch.

Finally, the exec lounge is as good as they good. Great selection of food and the staff working there is always terrific. 

Just everything about this place I like. This is a great option if you're staying in LA, or if you just want to spend the night for an early flight or if you have a lay over. 

Honestly, I think this is one of Sheraton's top properties.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<rating>4< /rating><text>Right next to LAX with a reliable shuttle service. Stayed on the club level, where the rooms have been renovated. However it was very easy to hear what was going on in the connected room and the hallway. Doors need to be updated for soundproofing. Food and drinks in the lounge were very nice and staff were polite and attentive. Being on the top floor, we could hear every plane land and takeoff with ease. I do think the benefits outweigh the negatives and would stay again.< /text>< Date>

<Review>Management does not appear concerned with keeping your business. Talking to the manager was a fruitless endeavor. The airline’s travel agency stated it would contact the hotel to give them the voucher code to extend my stay. I soon learned the next day this was not possible.

American Airlines lost my suitcase.. I was not able to make my flight to Hawaii either. Travelled 12 hours to Los Angeles just to have my trip to Hawaii cancelled. Very tired going back and forth to the airport from the hotel with a support animal to rectify issues the airline caused me.

I asked the manager if he could wait as I just got back to the hotel. I wanted to eat and feed my dog. He looked at his watch and said it was 11:06 and that I had time to go back to the airport and get the voucher . He said he was ‘instructing me..’ lol unreal

Can I add that the first night I stayed at the hotel, I was put into an adjoining room and was unable to sleep because of the people making a lot of noise at 3-7 a.m in the morning. Not cool after you’ve travelled 12 hours.

Their shuttle bus driver made a very unfriendly comment on the bus. He said due to the issues I was having while visiting the states was probably karma. Then he said, I hope you have a safe flight back (insinuating I have bad luck and hopefully nothing else bad happens to me).

Well a bad experience overall and the hotel did not help the situation

Airline put me up at the hotel after I said it would be too much trouble to transfer to a different hotel as I was already exhausted traveling.

In the future, when I make hotel reservations, it won’t be with any of the sheraton hotel chains. It will be with the Hilton or holiday inn.

I’ve just asked the airline to put me on the first flight out of here as I don’t want to stay at this hotel or in this city another night but unfortunately they can’t send me back until tomorrow.

Empathy is very inexpensive and yet some people working in leadership lack this basic skill. I would have even given you my credit card to hold the room as I was very exhausted going back and forth to the airport on very little sleep.< /Review><UserId.>107628330897110279835<//UserId.>< Response>

<user>None<//user><user_name>Tonester<//user_name><date>1507939200000< /date><rating>None<//rating><text>This is my 4th stay in this hotel, which has awesome location for airport travelers and also new rooms. 

Upon check-in, the staff could not locate my reservation. I had checked on my SPG app and also found that it had been cancelled. At the end I had to find my confirmation email, and provide my reservation for the hotel to get me a room. It took a while, which was not so pleasant as I had just got off of a 14 hr flight and it was almost 11pm. As the guest service team member took a while to resolve my issue, I double checked my reservation emails and confirmed that I did not cancel the room. So I asked again when the guest service team member returned to the front desk from the back, who cancelled my room? She said she did not know as the system does not tell her. Nonetheless she got me a room and my late check-out as a platinum member.

This time I had problems sleeping because of the constantly noise from airplanes taking off. After laying in bed for an hour, I called the frontdesk and asked for a room that does not face the runway. The front desk promptly complied with my request and it was a perfect evening after that. 

Breakfast was great, both the food & service. The valet parking service was great, I called ahead and the car was waiting for me. The valet team helped me with my luggage and it was a great stay altogether except for losing my reservation at check-in.</text>< pics>

Very nice Sheraton within walking distance of LAX. Perfect for overnighting to catch a flight. It has all you need on site. My room was very nice and quiet on a high floor overlooking the runway action in the the distance.< /Text>

Good location, comfortable room but the shower was below expected for a sheraton and despite the advertisement say parking available, they hide it costs $ 50/day, more than absurd it`s disappointing see a big company of hotels such as Marriot/Sheraton do not offer free parking, independent the location in the world. Politics of savage capitalism does not grow anymore. IT MUST BE REVIEWED ASAP.<//Review>

<text>Room was nice, check in was fine. However, I was awakened after midnight by very noisy people in the room adjoining mine. I know that is not the hotel's fault but my issue has to do with how the hotel staff reacted to my complaint. I called the front desk and was left on hold for several minutes. The person that answered "greeted" me with an abrupt "yes?" I told him the problem and he said "I'll send someone up" -- that was it. No "I'm sorry you were awakened/inconvenienced" or any other such courtesy. I never heard anyone "come up" to the room next door -- I waited about 20 minutes and never heard anything (no knock or phone ring) and then fell asleep. In the morning, I complained to the front desk about the incident and all she had to say was "wow". So, given there are so many hotels in the area, I will not be staying at this one again!</text><name>Caro17</name>< Pictures>

Overall this is a great hotel, ideal for a layover before a long flight. Is also perfectly located for easy access to Manhattan Beach and Santa Monica. 
My only complaint about the hotel is the restaurant menu. There are no staples that are normally on a room service menu, and are ideal for after a long flight, such as a club sandwich or spaghetti Bolognese. And the portions of the dishes that I ordered are small, specifically the salmon dish.</text>

<Rating>None<//Rating><Date>1372204800000<//Date><Response>None</Response><Text>The hotel itself is very clean and the staff is courteous. The bed mattresses are nowhere near as comfortable as I had hoped for, but the bedding/pillows were very comfortable. You could tell the rooms were older, but again very clean. I wished the sink/vanity were separate from the toilet and shower. Just makes it easier to get ready if you're sharing a room. The views are not very good. The pool area is alot smaller than what appeared online, but still very nice. I liked the Paparazzi restaurant at the hotel, it was very good and the staff were excellent. The hotel does provide a shuttle to Manhattan beach and the mall for a small fee. Other than that, there is no place within walking distance. I found some of the concierges hard to understand due to heavy accents. I'm not sure if I'd stay at this particular hotel again, only because of the location. I would recommend it to anyone who just needed a nice place to stay with courteous staff near the airport.< /Text>< userid>

Excessively noisy. Had to complain to staff. This is the 1st 4 star hotel I have stayed at that I can even hear anything coming from other rooms or hallways. So far 2 out of 2 days I have been woken up from noise before 730AM. Also, gift shop over charges. $10 for band aids, everything seemed to be 2 to 3 times more expensive.  COLD bottled coffee  for over $5, I normally pay $1.99 And Ricola cough drops that sell for. 99 are over $4. Parking sucks also. The only reasonable thing is The price for the room which is very nice.< /Review>

<Text>My wife and I stayed here for one night as a date night getaway. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and the room was comfortable. The room was very quiet even though you are right next to the LAX landing approach. We had a light dinner in the lounge that was reasonable and the buffet breakfast was quite good. I would recommend this hotel for business stays and getaways. Hotel is close to the South Bay and the Marina Del Rey.</Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_name>

<Rate>None<//Rate><review>Room and hotel accommodations were clean and modern. I opted for the 'Green program'; I am a big proponent of these environmental friendly programs. I do not have visibility of your take rate, but I cannot imagine a $5.00 coupon (for food/drinks or minimal loyalty points) is a great enticement for someone to consider opting in the program. If Sheraton is truly serious of helping the environment, I would expect Sheraton to enrich the program; i.e. free breakfast, or discounted room rates. I suspect Sheraton is reaping all the benefits of not having a room serviced! $5.00 just does not cut it.</review>< Pictures>

Lacks customer service. Although the location and hotel itself is good, various staff members need training on how to deliver good customer service. I had several negative experiences with staff members lacking basic manners or willingness to help. For example, I was told I had to wait one hour for hot sauce to be brought up to my room - seemed a bit ridiculous to me.</Text>

We chose the Sheraton Gateway for its proximity to LAX -- and based on other reviews. All we can say is that we were thrilled! Our room was extremely comfortable. The staff was OUTSTANDING! Yes, it's their job to be helpful, but every single individual we encountered was friendly and happy to help/answer our questions! We stayed at the hotel only overnight -- a waystation en route to our final destination -- and now we know where we'll be welcome the next time we're in town!<//Text>

Great hotel very close to the airport! It even has a little pool, though no one seems to use it. You get 5 pages printing for free, which is great for printing boarding cards, for example. They have a room service robot, which is really cool.</Text>

<Text>I was impressed with the quality of the rooms. The limited food options in the hotel made it hard for me as I am gluten free. The price for the food was also outrageous given the portion size and quality. Also the self parking although cheap is a little sketchy that you have to park so far behind the hotel, and walk quite a ways (especially if the weather is not good).<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Decently nice hotel building wise. But as a lot of others here have mentioned that, the staff at front desk along with others are quite rude and unprofessional. Staff here needs better training on customer service for sure .  One star because some of the staff. With Sheraton , I expected better service , not kids with uniforms.  But room and lobby looks nice. Parking is $37 a day. Meh over all not impressed. Would of probably gotten friendly service at a motel 6 or super 8 sadly .</Review>< Name>

<Text>I stayed only one night following a week of meetings elsewhere in CA, to catch an early flight home the next morning. The front desk staff was very friendly and made me feel welcome. They upgraded me to a corner suite (due to my platinum status). I wish I was staying longer to really enjoy the room and the other hotel facilities. I will definitely return to this hotel when my travels take me near Los Angeles. Keep up the great work.< /Text>< user>

<review>A shuttle that runs every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day, is a huge plus. On a layover from Hong Kong, being able to check out at 2 pm the next day was appreciated. Room was very clean and tidy. Front desk staff was pleasant. Snacks in the "club lounge" 5-7:30 pm were much better than expected, but only beer and wine. BUT..Room service did not deliver what I ordered, but at 11 PM I just accepted it. Stayed on the "club" floor on the top floor 15, but could hear furniture dragging on the floor above me. So there must be something above 15th floor. Furniture dragging was not too bad at night, but i needed to sleep in late from my Hong Kong flight. The noise above got bad at 7:30 AM and made it impossible to get back to sleep along with the constant sound of doors slamming, and housekeepers talking loudly in the hallways.</review>< Pics>

<Review>After traveling 30 hours i had a lengthy stay at LAX. The Sheraton offered a perfect day rate. The bed was excellent and i slept like a rock in a well appointed large room. The stand up shower sure beats the old bathtubs. The room service was okay, but $64 for soup and a burger and an hour wait is a little out of line, I advise caution. All in all, a great place to rest.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d< /gmap_id><Rate>None<//Rate><Date>1513209600000<//Date>< Pics>

<text>My only complaint is regarding the bathroom in the room. Upon arrival, the toilet in the had a clump of hair and what appeared to be urine in the toilet that was unflushed. The drain cover in the sink is tilted so you can see just how dirty it is. The toilet seat is very loose so that you can enjoy a small shifting attraction while you use the toilet. It made me really wonder if the room was properly cleaned, especially the bathroom, prior to my arrival.</text>< gmapID>

Very bad service. Under qualified employees. I'm staying here for 3 nights and so far, although it's only been one night, the hotel staff is careless. It doesn't seem like they care about their guests at all. Sink didn't work properly when we arrived. Then, when we had to pay for our parking and buy their guest parking pass (what kind of hotel charges for parking anyways?), the pass didn't work initially. It turns out you had to put in your original pass in first (which was expired) and then the new one. The parking lot isn't even behind the hotel. Do yourself a favor, save some money, and go to a different hotel. :)<//Review>

Airport shuttle was full every time it came to terminal to pick us up. After waiting over a half hour the only way we were able to get on one was without a seat. Very unsafe.

<Rate>None< /Rate><Review>I booked two rooms for a special occasion. I read reviews, but I had never stayed at the hotel and I hoped that the positive feedback I read would be true. Beginning at check-in, my expectations were exceeded and then some. The Corner King Suites and gorgeous! The rooms are big, the beds are wonderfully comfortable, the rooms are impeccably clean, the staff was friendly and helpful. You would not know that you are less than a mile from the airport, the room was serene and quite. The pool area was very nice -- the cabanas were such a nice treat for the kids in our party -- they felt special and important.
I would absolutely book another stay at the Sheraton Gateway and I will be recommending your hotel to my friends and family. Thank you!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Good Customer Service. It is located by the Airport so if you are a light sleeper you may want to stay at a further Hotel. The only 2 issue we really encountered were the parking there is a lot behind the hotel and if you are parking for the night it is $17.50 but not in and out. They advise you at the desk for check in that you can get a day pass (24hr from time of purchase) for $26. The other issue is be sure to let them know you do not want a conjoined room. You will be able to hear EVERYTHING your neighbors do. Overall very convenient hotel location wise.< /Text>< pics>

Impressive lobby and finishes in the room & bathroom. Could have been a little more neat in my opinion but overall nice. (Bed skirt was not aligned right.)
Valet is really pricey, easy enough to self park for $17 per day.<//Text>

We like this Sheraton because they offer the free shuttle to LAX, very convenient.
We arrived on Wednesday night to check in, our reservation a King Size Bedroom. The person at desk told us that the hotel was at full capacity and that we get 2 queen size beds. Already a bad start. I don't get why you have to make a reservation if when you show up they no longer have a room that fits your needs. A queen size bed for a person who is 6'4 means to sleep curled all night long if you stretch your legs will hang from this bed. We walk in the room, Room smells like smoke (it's a non smoking room) The room next to us, whoever was staying there was smoking weed you could smell it when we walked by.
They charge: $12.95 for 24 hours of basic internet.
Room service food not impressed for the prices. Paid $15 for a waffle. They charge $4.00 for delivery and a 16% charge ( you still have an option for additional tip )
I never mind the prices for room service and specially a place by the airport it's expected to be on the pricey side but the food is lacking so many things.

The outside of the hotel is trashed. When we walked in by the side there was empty bottles of vodka and tequila and plastic cups.

We have been part of the Sheraton point system since 2009 we have never gotten anything out of it.
I am very disappointed that big businesses like Sheraton try to give you crumbs for what you pay for. Other businesses will try to give you at least a muffin or something so small to show that they care. Don't expect it from Sheraton.

I'm giving Sheraton LAX a one start only because the service people are nice.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Very disappointed. I've never talked with such rude, impatient and unprofessional front desk before in any hotel.  House keeping service completely missed our room. I called front desk and get back this "It's 12:30am I don't know what you are trying to say".  The front desk is complaining about me bothering him late night?! Then I asked for more towels obviously we didn't have enough clean towels because our room didn't get cleaned. I hear a long sign after my request. I've been had good experience with Sheraton that's why I chose this hotel but probably won't go again. This hotel doesn't deserve it's price.</Text>

This hotel experience was one of the worst that I ever had. Upon arrival to my room I observed a wine glass outside the door. Next when we entered the room we then noticed Graham crackers on the floor. As I inspected the bed there was hair on two of the pillows. Clearly this room had not been cleaned. I expected more out of the Sheraton. I will never stay here again nor would I recommend it to anyone.< /Review>

Close to the airport, frequent shuttle service. Nice and quick check-in/out service, especially rushing to the airport. Great food and friendly service in the restaurant too.

Room is quiet, large, clean and neat but we were expecting some modern facilities just like other spg hotels, e.g. fridge, free bottle water, central/digital controlled lighting and air-con, weak shower faculties etc. Probably this hotel existed for a long time despite some renovations have been completed. 

Overall, a great experience and would come back next time.< /text>

We were told they were in an overbooked (not oversold) situation. I asked to be moved to another hotel and was told no as they were not oversold- only overbooked. After finally getting a room- it was not the room I had booked and paid for. I was given a key to the club level. I have not- in my years of traveling and despite having status for life, experienced anything like that. On top of it.

<text>Good hotel and sufficient quiet for an hotel so close to the airport. Large, clean rooms and friendly stuff. A point deduction because of the valet parking service: When we arrived they told us the self service parking is almost as expensive as the valet parking and with the discount he would gave it would be equal. Today we discovered the price of the self parking lot. It's half the price of the valet parking - after the discount...

The hotel offer shuttle to and from the airport every 15 min or so.

We were here due to our overseas flight got mechanical delay for 18 hours, we check in at 3am and thank god we were on the first bus load and got checked in fast. The staff was fast and friendly even at 3am!<//text>< pics>

The hotel was beautiful and clean, the bed comfortable and the staff nice. However, I would not go again and I wouldn't recommend it to others. The room I reserved was not available and there were apparently no other rooms with two beds. If I hadn't been checking in at midnight after a long day of traveling with children I would have gone elsewhere. We were "upgraded" to a corner suite and offered a roll away bed but we had four people, one still had to sleep on the hard couch and it took 45 minutes to get the roll away, which is a very long time after midnight. We were disappointed, all the luxury doesn't matter if we can't each have a bed.< /Text>

The hotel is ok to stay a couple of nights, reasonably priced. Good location if you want to be close to the airport. Rooms are clean.

However, you hear planes taking off from your room. The room service is mediocre and the laundry is completely overpriced.<//Review>

The desk staff was unequivocally friendly, the room was nice, the hotel was clean, and the soundproofing against the airport noise was outstanding. 

However, there were two rather big negatives:
1) The bar was refusing to use glassware (even though it was displayed in typical bar fashion), opting instead for plastic. To be served a $15 premium martini type drink in a plastic cup was ridiculous. The first time we were told no glasses were being used, the manager was nearby and he overrode the plastic dictum. We weren't so lucky the next day; it helped reduce our bar bill considerably, though. No explanation was given as to why they were substituting plastic for glass, but the bar was hopping and the hotel very full. I think they were pinching pennies on staff and their water bill, but that is just a guess.
2) The offer to "go green" by skipping maid service for a day is a sham. For years, we have "gone green" by simply re-hanging our towels instead of dropping them on the floor; now "going green" means you will not get your coffee in the room, the trash emptied, or have any other amenities refreshed; but the biggest effect is on another kind of "green": The impact on the paychecks of the housekeeping staff, as well as tip income, could be significant, and I do not approve of this type of business practice, especially considering the fact that this is not a budget hotel.<//text><gmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d< /gmapID><rating>None</rating><date>1496620800000< /date><username>RRanger</username>< userid>

<Text>I came into town for a workshop but the hotel was so comfortable I was almost wishing I had extended my stay by another night. I had dinner in the Paparazzi restaurant (bar). Carrie and Mario were terrific. Very accommodating and personable, and the food was outstanding. On Wednesday while I was waiting until time for my shuttle, Kevin in the lounge bar came by and made sure I attended to. You have a great staff there.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<text>The worst place to stay. Unless you are getting drop off here by shuttle or other way don't bother because they don't offer parking and the only place you can park is 2 blocks away and they don't even validate. Plus I ask if they would be responsible for any damages to my vehicle while I was park there and they said no.</text></record>

When I decide which airport to choose for stopover - I prefer LAX because of having this hotel.
I enjoy to stay here between long flights.
I like SPG lounge with views on planes.
I like LAX proximity. Sometimes I just walk there when bags are not heavy.
I will come back again for sure.<//Review>

Everything has been pretty good. There was a strange odor coming from our bathroom sink drain.  we did opt for valet since self park was $37 a night. My only complaint is that some times the wait for valet to get your car could be long. Rooms are pretty modern and updated. Stayed here for 3 nights and four days. I would recommend this hotel.</review>

< Review>
After months of looking around for hotels to celebrate my husband's birthday as we land in LA, i called Sheraton and booked the Sheraton Gateway Hotel.
Firstly i took the romance package which mentioned we will get wine and chocolate covered strawberries as we get in. We didn't receive that. Since it was a surprise i couldn't correct the front desk. After few minutes of settling down i went back to front desk and showed her the confirmation. She was very reluctant to call for the wine and chocolates as if she is doing a big favor. No apologies nothing. Then we waited for 3 hrs to get the wine and strawberries. All our evening plans had to be cancelled because whenever i was calling, they said its coming up, they are preparing the fruit as if they grew the strawberries and prepared the chocolate. Very disappointing. In this the surprise was wasted.
Secondly, while booking i requested for a birthday cake which had another story for which i had mailed earlier. Anyways i brought the cake myself and asked help of room service and concierge and delivering it to the room at midnight. The concierge representative that time was very unhelpful. When i brought my cake, his expression was "Thats it"... I was so embarrassed. Since it was only 2 of us i bought very small cakes so that food is not wasted. Anyways i was requesting him to bring up the cake to the room but at first it was so difficult to make him understand. Not sure if he had English understanding problem. Then he was going on coercing me to come down and get the cake myself. I tried to reason with him for room service since it was a surprise but then i was totally disappointed with the service and decided to take care of it myself.
Thirdly, the spa was so dirty. We went in to check and there was so much of hair and filthy. Looked like the water was not circulating properly. I took a picture as well in-case you need proof.
Fourthly, we had free WiFi included in package and the front desk didn't bother to let us know how to access. We were trying to login and it was showing a charge of around $12, then when we called the front desk, they said how to access. Not acceptable at all. Front desk should know what all information to provide to customers. Whatever is included int he package should be known to the front desk.
Fifth, the breakfast wasn't that good. There were varieties but not up to the standard.
Only thing i liked is the proximity of hotel to LAX and the STARBUCKS store.< /Review>

<review>From the time I stopped for the valet parking, the meeting Coco at the receptionist desk, everyone was helpful and went over and above. Thanks fr a great experience.

The only "unsatisfactory" which was the SPG recognition, because no one said anything about it. I also would have loved to know about the robot! So cool. It didn't effect my stay in any way. :)<//review>< rate>

I stayed at the Sheraton Gateway for 2 days. It was not a good experience. The 1st issue was the beds. They were as stiff as a board. I thought they put extra padding on these beds? I look and it was just an old mattress. 
The 2nd issue was the valet. They were extremely rude. One of them even tried to fight me because I would give them my keys right away. I called down to the manager but got no response. 
Never coming back.</review>

When we arrived at the Sheraton LAX, we were exhausted and looking forward to a night of rest before we headed off to Europe. When we arrived and went to the check-in desk, we were barely greeted by a very rude clerk. When I gave him my name for the booking, he looked at his computer for about two seconds and said, "Nope, you're not in the system." Baffled, I asked him to please check again, and got my SPG card out. "Yeah it's not in here, and that card won't help you," he said. He asked for the reservation number but I could not locate this; I stated that I found it odd they couldn't look up reservations by NAME, and he just brushed us off saying there was nothing more he could do.

We took a seat in the lobby and I proceeded to call my credit card company just to confirm we'd made the booking as we had paid in advance. After 15 minutes of phone calls, I finally got my booking number and proceeded to the desk. This time, we were met by a manager who AGAIN could not find our booking - even with our reservation number! By this time my husband was fed up and demanded to speak to someone else. We were presented with a senior manager, who magically found our booking after a few seconds of looking at the computer and suddenly declared us "Guests of the Day!" It seems they realized their mistake and this was a futile attempt to win us back.

There was no explanation given as to why the first two clerks could not find our booking, nor did either of the two apologize. The senior manager was very nice and did all he could to make us feel comfortable, including letting us know that he would be sending us a credit of 7000 SPG points to my account for our trouble. We appreciated this gesture and had a decent night in the hotel.

Well it's 6 weeks later and no sign of our points. Numerous emails to the senior manager have resulted in more empty promises from him to transfer these points. I have, in writing, his promise, but so far we've received nothing.

The whole experience has really put us off to the Sheraton and in Starwood hotels in general. We feel the "Guest of the Day" declaration and the promise of points were based on nothing other than making us happy in the moment - delivering on that promise has been another matter all together.<//review>

<Time>1476576000000<//Time><Rating>None<//Rating><text>I have stayed at this hotel 10-15 times in the last 3 years. This is my favorite LA hotel that is reasonably priced for LA. If you want an ocean view and a wallet gouge, try Le Meridien, or hip Hollywood flair and a wallet gouge try W Hollywood. 

I love this hotel. It has a great club lounge that is always stocked with soda, coffee, teas, snacks, etc. There is a hot breakfast in the club lounge every morning and appetizers in the evening. 

The staff are all amazing. The only time I had any issues, they immediately made it right. The last stay I was recovering from surgery and went to the hotel from the hospital. They were quick to check us in and it was great to recover watching the planes land, enjoying room service, and watching the newest movies. 

The only down side is that I always select make a green choice on my reservations and I just noticed that I did not get the points for that automatically. Some hotels you have to remind them at check out. I'm sure though when I contact them it will be fixed.

I noticed one review mentioned cigarette smoke. I am also super sensitive and I've never had that come up in all of my stays there. It must have been a guest in the next room or something as I've not had that experience.<//text>< gmap_id>

<Review>General Manager - Please accept my personal ‘thank you’ for your efforts which enabled me, while flying and without phone service, to make online SPG reservations for my wife. She reported that she her check-in was handled excellently. Never better! And, SPG allowed her to find a hotel and room quickly in an emergency.

 Thank you< /Review>< GmapID>

<Review>I would like to thank you for the good services that I had.  Everything was good until I forgot my lipstick in the room and I called the hotel to check it only 20’ after I left to the Venice beach, they said they’d call me back but never did.  And before I headed to the airport, I stopped by the hotel to get my luggage and asked if the housekeeping checked while they cleaning the room.  Took 15’ to talk on phone awith them and they said No.   It is really weird because I’m 100% sure I left it in the room.  I used it before I walked out of the room.  I wish I just Lyft back to room right away so I could get it.  It is my brand new lipstick and I am just kind of obsessed with the lipsticks, so it is just so upsetting when I had to lose it.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

< review>
Rooms were very clean, however needs an additional mirror area outside of the bathroom. The long mirror behind the bath door is fine, but no plugs and poor lighting so not functional. Only one person can get ready a t a time. Despite requesting a quiet room, we were woken up at 6:30a with a crying/screaming baby; and needed to attend a wedding that afternoon/evening. Restaurant waiter in the main dining was fantastic! Dishes are a little pricey but you do get a lot of food. We were only there 2 nights and did not see the "room needs service card" so our room was not cleaned. I later found out this card was inside of the black folder that I never checked. Thankfully we found a maid and she gave us fresh towels. Concierge needs some improvement.< /review>

<review>Lobby was nice, had a pianist playing most of the time, that’s where the positives stop. About $200/night, then $30-$45/day to park, oh and the continental breakfast that isn’t included in the room is about $20/person. Beds weren’t all that comfortable. Seemed like a basic hotel at a higher end cost. NOT WORTH THE $$$.< /review>< pics>

I recently stayed two nights at the LA Sheraton for a seminar. This building needs some updates. The ventilation system is very poor. My bathroom would constantly be full of cigarette smoke. I called the front desk to say that someone was smoking next door but the employee said that it could be from "anywhere in the building" It was so smoky and no windows open. 
The walls and doors are so thin that whenever someone down the hall leaves their room, the doors slam and it echos down the hallway. The last night, it was finally quiet until 10:15pm when the maid decided to clean the room next door until 11pm! 
The atmosphere was like an MTV show. If your looking for a quiet or relaxing place stay, this is definitely NOT the place.< /review>

Just stayed at this hotel while dealing with late night flights and it was a great experience.while some staff members were very unhelpful and just going through the motions two other staff members we dealt with were outstanding jose the night manager who helped us on the 2nd sept and merly on the 7th - 8th sept just so helpful
The rooms we had were very comfortable and mainly quiet (cleaning staff noisy at 8.30 am in other rooms)
Pool looked great as did the bar area, would be great as a 24 hour airport hotel to operate on a 21 hour cycle as some other hotels now do we arrived at 11.30 pm but didn't want to check out until 7pm the next day so had to pay an extra night, ( were offered 4 pm for a fee)on the 1st night stay the 2nd sept we had a early flight on the 3rd so only used room 6 hours so some extra flexibility would have been better, Westfield culver city 10 min drive,great shopping and restaurants
A big thank you again to Jose and Merly<//text>

The service at the front desk has slowly and noticeably depreciated in quality and efficiency. My last stay at Sheraton Gateway was at the end of August 2012, and it took me over an hour to finally check-in to my room. The issue started with me not being able to get access to the first room I was assigned. I mention to the woman ( will not be named) who checked me in that my access cards do not work, and I believe it was actually occupied because of the dirty dishes in front of the door and the noise I can hear from outside of the room. She assigned me another room, and as I had requested from the beginning, in not having a connected room to the ones next door, she promised me that the room will not be connected. My second time up the elevator led me to a room that was connected. I went downstairs, to remedy this situation (going back to the same front desk staff) for the 3rd try. Again, she sent me back up to a room that is connected. Normally I don’t have an issue with these mistakes, but her reluctance to believe that these rooms were connected irritated me. She insisted that in her system, these rooms were both unoccupied (from the first time) and not connected to other rooms (second and third time). By the fourth time, I requested to speak to the manager on duty.
Before the manager on duty (will also not be named on this open review) came to speak to me, the woman at the front desk begin asking the cleaning ladies to check the vacant rooms that was not connected on the SPG Club level. 10-15 minutes passed before they settled me in on the 5th floor- clearly indicating that there is an issue of (1) she (staff) does not know how to book a room that is vacant and not connected or (2) something is wrong with the current Sheraton Gateway System. Regardless of this situation with this staff and the system, I brought this to the attention of the manager on duty. I believe he offered to have someone bring me my luggage to my room, and to compensate me 4k points. I deny the help of staff carrying me luggage (and expressed my feeling that this should have been offered the second time, if not the third time they send me up to my assigned room). I also hope that the manager did not mean 4k points for my inconvenience that day; rather something more substantial, because 4k points isn’t nearly enough to even land me one free night at this hotel. Either way, I have yet to see any compensation in the points that the manager has offered. Overall, I am greatly disappointed with the performance of this hotel in their apparent decline of quality service at the front desk.</Text>< rating>

<username>Helpme< /username><text>I'm a SPG Gold member for the last three years. My recent stay was a really short one, for 4 hours. My flight was delayed and subsequently missed the last connecting flight home that day so I was forced to either get a room or sleep at LAX. After my experience there, I should've maybe saved $$$ and just slept at the airport.

I was greeted by the sweetest front desk agent. She got me checked in and I was on my way to my room. After I've settled down in my room, I proceeded to the bathroom. Upon entering, I noticed there was rubbish in the rubbish bin. When I lifted the toilet seat cover, I found paper soaking in the toilet. I quickly took out my disinfecting wipes and proceeded to wipe the bathroom down. When I tried to turn on the faucet at the sink, the hot water handle was literally coming off. Of course, I wasn't able to get hot water at the faucet. On top of that, the sink had stains in it, some kind of rusting which was strange since it was made up of some kind of composite material. As I moved about the bathroom, I found more water rusting stain by the door, bathtub toilet base. The bathroom was just disgusting. By now, it's 2 1/2 hours til I have to depart for my flight. So I decided to just suck it up and let it be. Under normal circumstances, I would've been out of there by now. Since the bathroom was so dirty, I wasn't sure if the bed was clean enough to sleep on, so I decided to sleep with all my clothes on.

All in all, I would never return to this hotel again or recommend it. I picked this hotel because its a Starwood hotel and because this hotel was much closer than the Westin to the airport.<//text>< pics>

You can not be shy. You have stop and ask for help. Once you do. In my experience. The service and assistance by the staff here is compatible to none.

<text>We were a party of four that arrived at 1:30a to find our room not available? I specifically called that day to confirm our reservation due to a delay in our flight - was assured by agent that the room would NOT be given away especially as we were arriving so late at night. NO roll away beds available - just 1 king bed. Two of us slept in bed and two of us had to sleep on the FLOOR. I can assure you that if it had been earlier in the day I would have walked out and found another hotel. But as it was so late we had no choice. As we were going to the room another family came in and had the exact same problem??? I really don't understand how this can happen at a hotel of this caliber? I will never book at a Sheraton again.

The hotel offers an exquisite restaurant which is open convenient hours, a club floor if you want to avoid the rush and have a complimentary snack or brink a beverage to your room, a large bar (in addition to the one in the restaurant) along with several other amenities. We were able to return our rental car the night before to save time and the shuttle took us right to our airline the next morning.</Review>< user_id>

One night I requested more towels and it took the staff about 20-25 minutes to bring them. I called back to the front desk 15 minutes after I requested more towels to make sure they didn't forget my request & the front desk didn't answer the phone. The staff not being knowledgeable is an inconvenience for customers. I asked two staff members about how does the parking work & neither of them could give me a straight forward answer. I feel as though employees should know how things operate being that they work there & I don't. Since the staff at the front desk couldn't answer my questions, I called the 1-800 number to see if they could possibly help, & the lady who I was transferred to was rude. The staff did not apologize for not being able to answer my questions, nor did they get someone else who could.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

The rooms were beautiful and I really like how they have a couch in their double queen rooms which is perfect to just sit down and relax. I also like that they have a Starbucks in the lobby so I can get some hot water and make some tea but they close early (4-5pm)

I really didn’t like their shower head it was so low flow that there was barely any water coming out.

Things to keep in mind: PAID WIFI 5$ for reg 15$ for high speed (free in the lobby)
valet is insane at 54$
There is self parking in the back for 17$a day but with no re-entry.
Breakfast prices are ridiculous and I guess that is to be expected. I ended up getting a Starbucks wrap because I didn’t want to leave and pay the 17$ parking fee to get back in.</text>

<rating>None< /rating><Text>Unfriendly front desk staff, very rude and not welcoming. I spent the previous year here for New Years and that was a wonderful experience. This past one was horrible. A simple inquiry at the front desk has to be broadcasted very loudly of why I couldn't receive a comp for breakfast buffet.

The club lounge had ultra economy food. The appetizers for New Year's Day was bean and cheese quesadilla, and bean salad as if they had an abundance of beans that had to be served somehow.

Asked guest service for a spoon as they did not have one in the club lounge and never received it at my door. 

Front desk could hardly be bothered and love to broadcast very loudly what you can and can't do without privacy to your questions.

Don't understand why they have sign for Massage next to their gym, but when you inquire about it there is this sarcastic answer like I should have known they don't have this service. (Why have a sign that says so, more importantly why doesn't anyone know why there is a Massage sign up.

Heat in room also jacked and blows cold air. 

Very poor experience!<//Text>< Pics>

Hotel and staff were great.

My only complaint is that my bill was never emailed to me, and the website receipt download function doesn't work for me.   There appears to be other people experiencing this same issue as stated on twitter.  Tried to call hotel about this problem and no one is picking up, will have to try again.  But right now I can't fill out my expense report.  PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE.</text>

<text>We only stayed for one night, but it was great! The room was very clean and the bathroom was amazing. I've had some terrible experiences with hotel showers but this was by far the best hotel shower ever. No joke. The only thing I didn't care much for was that there isn't parking on site. You either have to valet or park across the street and catch a shuttle or walk over. We got in late so it seemed a little sketchy to walk over. Luckily a shuttle was there to pick us up, but if it wasn't there, I felt pretty unsafe trying to cross a 4 lane street with no traffic light. Other than that, it was a great experience.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Dear Mr. Washington,
We are writing this review to inform you of the exceptional customer service and responsiveness of your staff members.
We were traveling from Europe and at the last minute our flight was cancelled. We promptly called the hotel to inform you, and Sara in reservation postponed our arrival with no charges.
At our arrival, after a long trip with our two young daughters the front office greeted us and was really great at giving us a room that could accommodate the 4 of us.

Hotel is very comfortable and staff really nice.<//review>

<Text>The hotel is undergoing a substantive reservation. There was absolutely no notice of this when I booked several recent stays.

The lobby is a mess. The elevators are tucked away inside plywood construction walls. Several were inoperable making early morning departures slow.

I had to remind the desk about my SPG options on check in, including wifi. Was offered an upgrade one stay which was appreciated.

In it's current incarnation, I simply cannot recommend the Sheraton Gateway, particularly with the wide range of options nearby. I'll revisit when the renovation is complete as the pool area is a great place to chill after a long flight. The staff at the breakfast buffet is also super friendly and should be commended.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< Review>
Shortly after checking into our room, we noticed a very bad smell in our floor's hallway near our room. I reported this to guest services. They indicated that a housekeeper would be up there to freshen up the area. I had to call a second time as the smell worsened and they assured me it would be taken care of. Finally, on a third call, I asked to be moved to another room. The third person I spoke with was very nice and promptly sent a bellman to our room with new keys. I had to return to the room for one more item. At that time there was a member of the housekeeping staff and also there were two security staff at the door of the person who was causing the issue. It was nice to see they were taking action to remove the cause. The security staff members were dressed very professionally and asked me some questions as I passed by. I felt confident that they would handle the situation. The new room was satisfactory although the bathroom door would not completely shut. The rooms felt clean and well stocked. Most of the staff at front desk was helpful - one, however, made us feel rushed as he was trying to get us out of the way so he could help an SPG guest who walked up behind us. Dining staff nice - we got an incorrect item, they corrected it right away. The housekeeping staff member I met in the hallway was very nice. The valet staff member out front was very helpful and friendly. The free airport shuttle was primarily the reason we chose this airport and it worked out well though we did have to wait a bit for the shuttle. But we anticipated this and arrived out front early. Overall despite the "incident" we encountered after check in - it was a pleasant stay, the food in the restaurant was good, staff helpful and friendly and the convenience to the airport would prompt me to recommend it and to stay again when I have the need to do so.<//Review>

Sad place to get stuck in. It has the amenities needed to appear like a good place but... The place is old and shows its wear and tear. The hallways to get to your room are dirty and smelly. The towels are old and could be replaced. The food at the bar is available for the late arrivals but many items were already unavailable. Gluten free and vegetarians stand little chance to get a decent meal. The salad looked old and unappetizing. Service was decent at the bar but the food needs improvement.
The beds were comfortable and you had plenty of pillows. The room was clean and could provide a decent rest for the weary traveler, unless you have to use their towels. A two star rating is all I could give this place.</Review>

Well the first stay here for an overnight stay to catch a morning flight was good.  Breakfast buffet was included in my room rate and it was good and Pedro a good waiter!  The second time (10 days later) I requested a high floor and Regretted it after getting to our room. If it hadn’t of been 12:45 AM  and we were exhausted we would have asked to be moved due to the smoke smell and the bathroom configuration.  The bathroom sink was just a small sink with absolutely zero counterspace, no place to put anything. We did have breakfast again and Pedro was again our waiter and was very good. We would stay here again just make sure you have a different bathroom.< /text>

<text>this ws my second stay at this hotel and it was just as pleasant as the first. I enjoyed the proximity to the airport and also to the freeways. the food was good but not worth the price. room service for 3 people was 150. dinner at Philipe for 3 people was 75. that would be my only complaint. My son did enjoy the pool. The parking is a little strange but it was reasonably priced.</text><resp>None< /resp><date>1398124800000<//date>< rating>

This is my hotel of choice for LAX stays and early morning flights to JFK. I was upgraded to a beautiful EXECUTIVE SUITE with a view of LAX.

POSITIVES: Beautiful hotel located close to LAX. Airport shuttle runs every 20 minutes 24/7. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The lobby is huge and spacious.

NEGATIVES: Shower has low pressure and the tubs are rather small. Overall even the bathrooms in the executive suites are small. The suites are totally not sound proof and I could clearly hear the conversation between a couple in the adjacent room. Ear muffs helped.

DINING: I ate at PAPARAZZI and the service along with the food was great. Beware of a lot of "Drunkos" who are sitting at the bar trying to muster up a conversation and showing you pictures of their "Model girlfriends'

STAFF: Very efficient and pleasing

OVERALL: Great choice for frequent travelers with early morning LAX flights.

This is truly a LAX favorite for me.<//text>

The friendliness of the staff was excellent. The cleanliness of the room was great as well but I do have a complaint. For the price I paid I expect things to be in slightly better condition in the guest rooms. The bathroom needed some repairs and improvement. When taking a shower I was standing in about 4 inches of water, it just seemed like it had been way too long since any remodeling had been done. Overall the stay was good and the staff was excellent.< /review>

<Text>Thehe entire staff is amazing especially the Hispanic girl with the red hair I'm sorry I forgot her name but she was amazing. She works downstairs at the front desk as well as on the 15th floor by the lounge. And there is a very bubbly African American young lady with light complexion who was also amazing. I had a few issues when I arrive in my hotel room on the 15th floor but it was all handled which I appreciate.<//Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< pictures>

<Text>It is hard to rate the amenities at the hotel as we only used a room for two hours; however, our experience with the Hotel has not been great. We paid for four rooms in full and advance, but our flight was cancelled and re-scheduled so we could not make it in time for check-in. Two emails were sent to the hotel to notify them of our delay and ask them to hold the room for us. One person in the party was able to make it the next day before the check out time. The situation was explained to the front desk and one room (of the four paid) was requested for two hours to shower and give back before the late check out time. The person at the front desk confirmed with the front desk manager and confirmed that the credit card would only be used for deposit purposes. In the end, the full room fee was charged to the credit card, so we have paid for five rooms to use one room for 2 hours. We expect the refund of the one additional room and have not received an acceptable answer.< /Text>< user_id>

<text>Hotel location is good. Customer service is good. My lady complains of wanting a bigger bathroom, but we both agree the hotel is good. The restaurant is above average and the bar at night is good She booked the room so at least it's not my fault. We both love the Starbucks in the morning. The barista has greeted us both with the happiest smile and good morning welcome. We looked forward to going down in the morning for our coffee and morning greeting. The morning concierge has been there for a while and is always so professional. This is a 4 Star hotel with 5 star service.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

The fact that it's closer to the airport is enough to get me in the door and the shuttle to LAX are fast and frequent. The design is a bit dated but gives you a feeling what it was like in LA 30 years ago. Nice pool area and bar. I've only eaten at one restaurant there and had the breakfast buffet. I'm going to skip that from now on. Wasn't that clean and the food wasn't at all worth the price. Otherwise great service and a decent place.< /Review>

However, the front desk staff were NOT very friendly, apparently my family and I didn't look well off enough to stay in this hotel. We were tired and obviously disheveled from being at a theme park all day. Anyway, the entire time during check in we felt we were rudely being looked down upon, 2 of the check in front desk employees were rudely looking at me and talking amongst themselves (clearly talking about me)! For this reason, my family and I will never be staying here again.</review>< Pictures>

I love this hotel. It is truly beautiful and located close to LAX. The club lounge was amazing. Good food.I was upgraded to a beautiful room and there was complimentary chocolate and a welcome card waiting for me in my room. I love the views of LAX from this hotel and you can view massive airplanes with weird names landing and taking off. The staff if very helpful and friendly. They have a airport shuttle that picks you up from LAX. I use this property for a quick overnighter before an early morning LAX-JFK transcontinental flight. Resting here energizes me upon landing in JFK. I LOVE THIS HOTEL so the non-member and preferred guys who did not give good reviews to this property I am truly sorry that you did not like this hotel. I truly think that you did not look at this hotel overall or did not give it a fair chance. But everybody is entitled to his/her opinion. HOTEL STAFF YOU GUYS DO A GREAT JOB. KEEP IT UP.< /review>

<Review>Our 2nd stay after 4 years apart and Sheraton never fail us! Bed is very comfortable. Counter and valet staffs are friendly. There is a laundry room and detergent can be bought at the gift shop. We stayed at the club room level which is open 24 hours. We are able to pop in anytime to get bottled water, tea and coffee. Only thing which need to be improved is the breakfast as they are serving the same food daily. Internet is fast. We were given a waiver off the room service fees as I feedback that toiletries, toothpaste and toothbrush were not replenish daily. Too bad, we didn't get to try paparazzi restaurant due to time constraint. Overall all, Nice and comfy hotel make our stay pleasant and memorable. Will definitely go back.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

My experience with this Sheraton hotel was exceptional. It had everything I needed to randomly explore all things LA; from downtown to the coast. The staff was friendly and kind with my needs; esp. the front desk who was most helpful in helping me have the best stay possible. I stayed for two nights. Both nights were undisturbed, as I had requested. The bus line was well within walking distance making exploring easy and inexpensive. The pool area was a bit small as advertised in their photographs; however, it was not crowded during my stay, so it didn't matter. I ordered room service on my first night, and the server was very friendly. The only downside of my stay was the washroom. It was clean; however, the toiletries were scattered about and not neatly kept. To me, it looked messy based on my other stays at other Sheratons.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying only a few days in the LAX area.<//Review>

Who is the lady that works in Starbucks in the morning. When your first trying to get your eyes open in the morning, and not really awake yet, it is wonderful to see a (BIG SMILE) on a servers face saying good morning, what can I get started for you. The smile was genuine. Was not forced or fake. I ask the front desk girl who she was. Ofelia is the name of the Happy Morning Starbucks girl. It just starts your day better.< /Text>

This Sheraton location is by far the worst hotel I have ever had to do business with. I have employees staying at this hotel constantly. If it wasn't for the group rate/block that I have to use, I'd definitely use other lodging arrangements. Calling here is a nightmare. I've been transferred to no less than 5 different extensions for the same request. Billing is a nightmare, requesting and receiving a credit card authorization is like pulling teeth. Once I finally get a hold of someone, I either don't get the email or get it days later. Even after a credit card authorization is sent, quite often my employees arrive and are told none are on file(even after I had called the previous week to confirm receipt). Other times they are charged on their own card instead, even though a credit card authorization is on file. The operator is normally short and transfers without even responding after I state what I need. The front desk staff are very friendly but often it takes 10 minutes or more before they answer after I am transferred. I book hotels weekly and deal with hundreds of hotels, none compare to this nightmare.</Review>

They are working on some elevator issues. The rooms are nice and relatively quiet. You can hear the planes in your rooms, though. Also all room doors slam and you will know when your neighbours are using them.<//Text>

<review>In overall I found that Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles is a Great Hotel, especially the staffs who have shown high integrity & responsibility and showed responsiveness to the hotel guests. Dec-18 I checked out of the hotel and accidently left my laptop, important documents, and US$ 3000.0 in the safe deposit box in the bedroom. Around 12 hours later, I just realized when I needed a laptop and I was outside LA already. I was worried and immediately called the hotel, but the staffs calmed me down, I spoke with the Chief of Security and he said that my belongings were safe and he will keep it. I came again the next day and happily got my all belongings back. Thanks to the Hotel Staffs in Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d<//GmapID></record>

I've stayed at this property 5 times in recent months and the facilities are good. The rooms are new and there are no complaints except for one: the food at the main restaurant sucks. Pretty much everything besides the steak is subpar. The worst of the worst is the Wagyu burger that I had twice (I have no idea why I decided to go for it the second time). I highly encourage the management to review the menu and taste the food themselves.

The room service is agonizingly slow. It took 1.5 hours to get the said burger. Not worth the wait.< /text>

<text>I am an avid traveller and a big SPG fan. I chose Sheraton Gateway for a quick layover between two international flights due to its proximity to the airport. I landed at 11:30PM and waited for the shuttle 20 minutes and finally after all shuttles had gone twice the sheraton/Joes parking shuttle shows up. The van is full and no space to sit. Once we reach the hotel, the people at the bell desk are chatting and no one comes up to help with luggage. When I reported this attitude to the front desk, they were very politely dismissive. I disregard this as maybe a late night thing. Next day morning, I had to catch the flight. I wait for the shuttle and the same issue. I eventually find out that they have outsourced the shuttle service to the neighboring parking service and they juggle between their clients and Sheraton's guests. This is not expected of a 4 star hotel. I am disappointed and would not recommend to anyone thinking of this as an option for proximity to airport.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Dirty sheets, used Qtips on the floor next to the bed, front desk never gave us a wake up call as requested. Never brought our Foam pillow or shaving kit as requested. Food from the restaurant downstairs was terrible for the price, just “Hotel Food” which is a shame in today’s world where most hotels we’ve stayed in this year have really stepped up the food game, Sheraton Gateway has not.<//Review>< resp>

This was the cleanest hotel I've stayed in ever. Usually hotel beds and towels have this nasty smell, but not this place. Everything in the room smelled legitimately clean which is the most important thing to me. Nice looking hotel with a bar downstairs. For parking, you can pay 40-something dollars for valet or $17 a day to park across the street. It had a beautiful clean bathroom and a flat screen tv. No free breakfast, but there's a Starbucks in the lobby. It's right by the airport but the planes didn't bother me. The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it didn't have a fridge and microwave. Other than that, I really enjoyed my stay and definitely recommend it.</Text>

<Review>Very good airport hotel.  My room appeared to have been renovated recently and included many outlets. Airport shuttle runs every 15-20 mins.  Breakfast in the lounge is very meager. I booked the most basic room and was upgraded to a suite as an SPG Platinum.  All in all, the stay was well above average for an airport Sheraton and a great value.< /Review></record>

He responds "Go ahead and use it". I asked "Is it free or not?" He just responded "Go ahead and use it". When I asked for the person's name, he hung up. This is unacceptable guest service.

I had to go do down to the front desk to get the free wifi added to my room.

<Response>None<//Response><user>None<//user><review>This hotel is virtually next door to LAX. Since I had a very early morning flight, I thought it would be the perfect location. I was greeted by guest services even before I arrived (via email) and then upon arrival. I felt very welcomed and valued. The Italian restaurant Papparazzi was wonderful, and although I was alone, I enjoyed the experience. If I have to fault the hotel at all, it is for the condition of the tub and counter in my bathroom, both of which were in need of refurbishment. But otherwise, the room was very clean and completely comfortable. If the sound of planes taking off during the night isn't a negative for you, I enthusiastically recommend this hotel. The shuttle service to the airport is great.< /review><gmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</gmapID>< Pictures>

Would have given a 3.5 if there were an option. The beds are comfortable, the restaurant food is decent, the rooms are pretty quiet (or no one was on either side of us), and the building is pretty nice but they're missing a few key features: WiFi in the rooms is not free, some electrical sockets do not work, no refrigerator in the room, and the shower pressure is low. We called for toothpaste twice and was told someone was coming but they never did; however, I won't count it against them because the front desk is very busy as it's such a big hotel. Great view of the city at night and many places to eat nearby. Not such a bad place to be. The hotel was paid for by work, so take it with a grain of salt.</review>

We have stayed at this hotel twice now after coming back from long flights to Asia Pacific and needed some down time for a day or two to get our body clocks back on track. Staff and service are excellent and any needs were met immediately. We would definitely stay again at this hotel while into LAX. We upgraded to the Club Lounge so easy walk on our floor for free breakfast and appies in the afternoon. Free internet was also included. We took the Ocean Express shuttle and went to two malls for shopping and also down to Manhattan Beach Pier. great service if you want to see some of the area but don;t want to rent a car.</Text>

When the water in the shower was turned on, black small flying type bugs appeared...
Worst Valet service I have ever had. For the price you would expect prompt service. I stayed 5 nights and each day I ended up having to get their attention to assist me, either they were talking to each other or two times no one was around. In fact one night no one was even around to take my keys. I went to the hotel check in counter and she couldn't find the workers either. I ended up just leaving my car. VERY frustrating and unprofessional.< /review>

<text>Staff is very friendly. The room was pretty clean besides the right area like between the cushions under the bed, etc. The bathroom was an ok size and the shower had good water pressure with 3 settings to adjust to. The best part was beds that weren't quite queen sizes but absolutely one of the best beds I've ever slept on<//text>< Time>

Great overnight stay. Room service was efficient and the food was great. Comfortable beds and room was neat and clean.
The only drawback was they wanted to charge me for the internet. I am a rewards member so was quite taken back with the $12.95 requested internet charge.</Review>

Arrived at the hotel on 21st September after a late flight from London. Shuttle bus arrived after about five minutes and we were greeted by a very effusive driver who "welcomed us to LA". Five minutes later we arrived at the hotel and all the check in desks were quickly opened so check in was very swift. Got an upgrade to a corner room on my Starwood Gold card. Breakfast, [included in my rate] was excellent with a good choice of fruit, fried breakfast etc. Check out was also very efficient.

Having stayed at LAX several times this is without doubt the best of the airport hotels. Combine a great rate for the room, including two breakfasts, $129, booked direct with Sheraton on the web and you cannot go wrong.

Everything above expectation so definately will return on the next LA trip.</Text>

Restaurant lives up to reviews. Ate in bar and service was exceptional. Exceptional! This definitely is not an airport hotel feel nor, for that matter, a typical Sheraton. Would highly recommend and look forward to coming back.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>Loved our stay here! We were on an 8 day trip, flew into LA, rented a convertible Mustang, drove the PCH to San Francisco and back down to LA for the last 2 days of our trip. We are SPG member so all but one of our stays were at a Sheraton. This was by far the best...we were treated the best and it was the cleanest and best all around out of all our stays! We were treated like stars! Upgraded to Executive Suite and free parking thrown in on top of that. LOVED the room, we ate at Paparazzi's in the hotel the night of my husband's birthday and the service was great and they even brought out a piece of tiramisu with a candle in it for my husband! We used out Starpoints so our stay was free all the way around ( other than dinner).
.We highly recommend this hotel and cant wait to visit again!< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Rooms were clean. Bathrooms were also clean but for stray hair in the shower. That being said, the shower had amazing water pressure. Food and drinks at the bar are A+. Food in the restaurant was just ok - wouldn't eat there again. Convenient shuffle service to and from LAX. Great view of airplanes descending on to the tarmac - Very cool!< /Text>

<Text>I loved that the hotel was 5 minutes from the airport. It was so easy for travel and I was pleased to see how close we were to the beach! The staff was so personable and helpful, we really felt like guests in their home. We got loads of help with our sightseeing from the desk, which really enriched our stay. The view from our room was awesome- we could see downtown LA, mountains in the distance, and I loved watching the planes come in. I especially appreciated the Green Room option to decline maid service for a $5 coupon per night. I totally support green choices and we were able to get a free item at the Starbucks in the lobby every day with our coupons. Such a great perk! We ended every night relaxing in the hot tub and chatting with other guests... how perfect! We really loved it and would definitely stay again.</Text>< Resp>

< Review>
Glad the renovations are progressing. Have not stayed in an updated room yet but am looking forward to the experience. It is the staff that make this hotel exceptional. Always friendly and professional. One of the best breakfast buffets around. Good Starwood recognition, too. Looking forward to my next stay!< /Review>

<time>1490313600000< /time><Review>What a treat not to have to wait but just a few moments before the hotel shuttle arrived at LAX to take me to the hotel. The room was very clean and comfortable. The meeting room was nice and was neither too warm nor too cold. My only issue was that the in room coffee maker did not work. Unfortunately, I forgot to report this. This slight problem certainly would not stop me from recommending this hotel to anyone else. I would be happy to stay here again.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d< /gmap_id><Name>Marilyn777< /Name>< Rate>

I wasn't expecting too much--just needed a place to crash close to the airport--so I was pleasantly surprised when I was upgraded to a large suite. I was supposed to meet some friends for dinner, but we ended up staying in and ordering room service instead, which was so much more fun! Thank you!</Text>

The hotel is located about a mile away from the airport, making it a very convenient choice based on distance. The rooms are also decorated nicely. The only issue is that the service was not very friendly. The front desk receptionists weren't welcoming and even showed a hint of attitude.<//Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Booked a one night stay for a concert I attended. At first, it was great. Based on my stay and the hotel itself, I would've given 4-5 stars. However, shortly after checking out, I noticed that the hotel charged me an additional $500 (mind you I prepaid for the room and my deposit had already been taken out when I checked in). I hadn't gotten any type of phone call, receipt or e-mail correspondence in regards to the charge. When I called the hotels accounting department, I was told that the $500 charge was to cover damages to the desk in the room. I didn't even use the desk. I used the bathroom to get ready in and the bed to sleep in for a short period of time. That was ALL. I went on to request further details in regards to the damage, because I knew for fact that it was not a result of my stay in the room. After waiting for a day, the associate who was helping me e-mailed me a photo of the damage. It literally looked like someone angrily took a knife to the surface of the desk. I was then told that if I wanted to dispute the charge I would have to contact my bank. I explained that I would not be contacting my bank because of their staffs incompetence. Clearly, upon the previous guests check out, the cleaning staff (or whoever) didn't do a well enough job checking for damages, so they decided to assume the damage came from me just so that they could get money out of someone. I totally understand if I were responsible for the damages. In that case, I would've brushed it off and taken the responsibility because I am an honest person. I asked to speak to a supervisor because it wasn't fair to have to go through a 30-day dispute with my bank to only hope for my money back that paid for someone else's damage to their property. Ultimately, and with a fight, I was granted a refund. But, I am completely turned off by the way this was handled. I would've appreciated being contacted by someone before $500 was wrongfully charged to my debit card without explanation and not being (basically) told to deal with it when I called to complain. Horrible customer service in that aspect. I will never visit this hotel again.< /Text>< pictures>

For the price I paid, this is definitely thee BEST hotel I've stayed in. Basically paid a MOTEL price for an upscale HOTEL room/experience. Location and surrounding area was perfect (safety wise). My family stayed in a corner king suite and it was clean and fresh upon arrival. Definetly would stay here again< /Text>

Staff is very friendly, facility is clean and organized everywhere you turn, house keeping is on point. Not really much to complain about, very decent hotel, overall

Edit: had to subtract a star due to on issue that I experienced 3/4 mornings of my stay... waking up to lukewarm water for my shower.  I've NEVER run out of hot water in a hotel before...</Review>

<text>As always the club lounge staffs amazing. The gentleman working in the morning is always very friendly and extremely helpful. I wish I could catch his name but he is always moving to fast. Front desk is efficient and friendly. I wish I could say the same about the valet. Valet is very slow and I often times find them standing around talking while customers are needing their vehicles. This has been an issue on more than one occasion. Overall, this is an excellent hotel and is very convenient to the airport.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I spent two nights here after flying out for a business meeting - which was ironically cancelled just as I landed, so I spent all my time at the hotel.

The lobby is spacious, with the front desk immediately accessible, and a dedicated line for flight crews given it’s proximity. I was immediately able to skip the queue in the Platinum line, and was given an upgrade to a larger room facing the south side of the runway.

Yes, the hotel is VERY close to the airport, nestled near the end of the north runways, and above the south. I had a great view to watch the planes taking off - as a traveller, I do enjoy that!

Noise was not an issue - the south runways were far enough way to be a dim humming, which I was grateful for and surprised about.

Standard Sheraton room - spacious with a sitting and working area, although it seemed to have an older TV cabinet more suited for a CRT TV (slide-out tray style).

Lounge was a fair size larger than a standard Sheraton lounge, and offered evening hors-d’ouvre and a continental breakfast. I always appreciate a lounge with a mini-fridge of water bottles, never drinking the tap water, and it was constantly being refilled. Food was good - and being at an international airport, also had some Asian food choices.

Internet speed was great, but the biggest features I liked were the gym and the pool.

Despite being an airport hotel, it has a sizable pool and hot tub, and great sunlight during the day. The gym is also more of a rectangle on the main floor, with the main cardio machines facing out a long row of windows onto the pool deck. No staring at the wall!

Highly recommend this hotel for an overnight at LAX, or even if you’re on business / visiting the south side of LA.< /Text>

However the rooms are a little on the dark side, poor lighting and even the tv was dark and that was after the technician came to look at it. The basin in the bathroom had a big crack in it, making it a breeding ground for bacteria. Staff were however very polite and attentive responding promptly for requests like soap, tea and coffee,etc. stayed here 2 years ago and I feel the standard was better then, to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt it could be because they were renovating the lobby but I don't think I'll stay here again.< /text>< time>

<Text>This hotel is as close as you can get to the airport without having to go through TSA but yet, rooms are quiet. Staff definitely improved since last stay. Check in was swift and pleasant with agent very very cordial. I wished I had the gentlemen's name but he was a superstar.

Rooms very clean with ample room for extended stays.

Pool area very nice but hot tub out of commission due to unsupervised children exploring.

The restaurant ok but note the food is good but just pricey. Parking consistent with other LA area hotels.< /Text>< pictures>

We spent one night on June 20th and LOVED IT!!!! The lobby Italian restaurant is AMAZING! And has a bar for a more relaxed environment or white linen table for a business/ romantic setting. The bar area is open and comfortable. To our surprise the hotel takes pets!!! Hotel has a shuttle that runs every 15 minutes to LAX. We usually stay at the Sheraton downtown for subway access but this is our NEW FAVORITE! Hotel is gorgeous! MUST TRY!!!<//text>

<Text>I use to love the Sheraton passing through LAX. My last experience was forgettable. The room smelled funny and I requested a quiet room as I had an early flight. I was placed in one facing the runway! The hotel was not even busy. I could also hear the pipes each time my neighbour used the shower and bathroom. I checked out early at 4am to catch a 6am flight on 03/27/13. There was no one at the front desk for 10 minutes. I guess he was checking out as well! When he showed up, he didn't even apologize or acknowledged me. Just asked if I wanted a paper bill! I guess if I didn't, I would have done the express check out! I will definitely look for other options on my next trip. Being an SPG member made very little difference.</Text>< Pictures>

It's tough to be an airport hotel, but the Sheraton LAX manages to do a great job and providing a full-service experience in a difficult environment. I love being able to walk directly from the airport without taking a bus, and the hotel has multiple restaurants, comfortable conference facilities, and an attractive gym and pool. Staff make every effort to be helpful. I've stayed at a few other properties along Century Blvd, but this one is easily the best.<//Review>

<text>Check-in staff were extremely helpful and provided options with regards sightseeing (Santa Monica), travel means and checkout due to my demand to meet an international flight. The room was spacious, clean and quiet; the pool refreshing and the overall experience worthy of comment. A great place to stay if you're travelling internationally but still have a short period of time to enjoy the local attractions.< /text></record>

<review>I attended a conference the weekend of September 28, 2012. Overall facility functions were really good. My interaction with staff was excellent; if they said something would be taken care of - it was.
Regarding room cleanliness - it could have been better: smudges on full length mirror, liquid/drip mark residue on bathroom door. All easily handled, as I carry anti-bacterial wipes for all hotel stays (remote, light switches, door knobs, toilet seat, etc).</review>< Pics>

Stayed for a night on May 23rd. Hotel is nice and rooms look good. Location is also great if flying out early. However, my room had a very foul smell, almost like a sewer or something. Very unpleasant. Thos was on the 14th floor, please look into it. Would not stay again as a result.</text>

<review>Renovation beautiful. Check in late at night efficient and welcoming. Room clean and comfortable. Club Lounge nicely redecorated, but, as usual, overcrowded in 30 min prior to breakfast closure at 9:00am (PLEASE extend morning buffet hours to at least 9:30, or, preferably, 10!). Shuttle service back to airport uncomplicated and courteous in spite of horrendous terminal traffic. Thanks - we'll be back!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<review>Starwood points used. We decided we needed a hotel the night before the airport, so left our Palm Desert villa a day early. So glad we made that decision, as traffic was nuts coming in to LA. Check-in was quick, room and sleep were tremendous, and using the Club Lounge for breakfast was a wonderful bonus (sometimes we get this perk at Sheraton hotels, sometimes we don't, for whatever reasons). The breakfast buffet was nice and varied. Check-out easy, and the free shuttle to the airport was appreciated. We would do this again, and stay here as well. Very convenient.< /review><Rate>None< /Rate>< gmap_id>

It was my first time to stay at this hotel and I would stay again the next time I am in LA area. 

If this is how SPG runs all their hotels I will definitely stay again in this property and in other SPG branded hotels. Overall the staff did the best to provide excellent customer service.</review>

<Text>The maid-staff on fourth floor was so kind and helpful! Thank you to them.
The young man at the Concierge desk in the lobby was so helpful to me, with a luggage cart, holding my belongings for an hour and a half, and helping to load my car out front. A perfect gentleman, I'm grateful to him.
Our meetings were in generally comfortable rooms; catering minimal but well-done but the decor was neutral.< /Text>< gmap_id>

We stayed at this hotel due to it's close proximity to LAX and our early morning flights the next day. We checked in on a Sunday 6/29 to get a good night's sleep and utilize the shuttle service the next morning.

Check in was fine - the front desk even gave us a complementary credit at the beginning to try the hotel ammenities....this is where the trouble began.

We had dinner in the hotel lounge (Rendezvous) and while the food was very overpriced, we accepted that for what it was ($$$$ for 2 kids meals, a split of a fish and chips, a house wine and 2 draft beers) but upon checkout, we noticed that the our portfolio was charged 3 times for the same $$$$$. We recognized the mistake before we left the hotel and the front desk supposedly corrected the error.

Unfortunately, the next day (7/1), the hotel went ahead and reprocessed the overcharge again. I saw the cahrge on my AMEX and left multiple messages for the business office with no reply. I finally spoke to the manager on duty last week and spent 20 minutes on the phone with him as well explaining the issue. He apologized and said the credit would be processed ASAP and I would receive an acknowedgement once it was corrected.

As of 7/16 at 937am local time - no credit - no email - no response - I had no choice but to waste even more time and contest the charge with AMEX but at least I know it will get corrected now and I would be stuck paying $$$$ multiple times for 3 not very good meals.

Dissapointing. This experience with the business office took what should have been a good stay and soured the entire trip.

CHECK YOUR PORTFOLIO CAREFULLY and check your statement to ensure you were not overcharged by the hotel.< /text>

Modern and lush. Airport shuttle runs 24/7 and the front desk folks were so nice despite my redeye jet lag. The bed was super soft (not good for those that like more support) but the room was clean, amazingly quiet (given the airport is right there) and the thermostat has a fan and cool setting for background noise. My only negative was the bathroom shower.< /Text>

This was the best stay I have ever had at a hotel! I was there for 7 nights, there were lots of phone calls from booking to departure and person to person communication while staying there. 90% of all communication was delivered with over the top friendliness and professionalism. The staff went above and beyond to make my stay pleasant and comfortable! The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. Cleanliness is the most important thing for me in a hotel stay. Gateway Sheraton met that need 100% and achieved top notch customer service too - you can't get any better than that!!< /review>

Pros: Friendly staff,updated rooms, shuttles to the airport. The only cons is an overpriced valet parking. Luckily you can use public parking in the next door building  for a third of that price.< /Review>

<rate>None< /rate><text>I stayed here on Christmas Eve and overall found the hotel to be really nice. I was greeted by Mr. Oberoi at the front desk & he couldn't have been nicer! After checking in, I did go to the bar to get a drink and was upset at the lack of service. I waited over 10-15 mins to order a drink and within those 10 mins I had to go and request a menu (which at first the bartender refused and said the waitress would provide it. The second time I went up I got a menu). I was fine with ordering my own drink as well but the bartender refused and said the waitress had to get my order. I did mention this to the manager on duty and he was nice enough to offer free food (which we declined).

Club lounge was very spacious with an excellent breakfast.

Overall this is a really nice hotel!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Usually I don’t have any problems. I love the rooms lounge decor food and staff. Unfortunately this last stay was not so great. The music at the pool woke me. I had to catch an early flight in the morning. I was told that I could come down and get a key to a different room and the move my stuff on my own. It was the customer service response I was used to at this hotel.<//Text>

We spent only one night at the hotel. Room was nice and very comfortable beds. The design of the hotel lobby and the gym and pool area was also nice. 
The food was way too expensive and Starbucks service was lacking. 

The noise level on room on floor 6 was terrible! You can hear people's conversations when they are in the hallway. You can hear the water running in the guest staying next to your room. Bring ear plugs and then this location is perfect!</Text>

I ended up having a delightful experience during my brief stay. The hotel was beautiful (hip, urban and fun) and my room was larger and nicer than expected.

<Rating>None</Rating><text>We stayed at the Sheraton Gateway LAX after a late flight from the east coast. 

Pros: 
--the checkin was quick, efficient, and friendly, which was great given the fact that we had two young children on the verge of collapse
--my SPG Gold status was recognized, and amenity offered
--the room booked was exactly as described, and the benefits were explained upon checkin
--the room was clean and comfy, and the beds great for us and our two little ones
--the club lounge was great, and had everything we needed for breakfast the next morning. the waiter there was able to get my kids some apple juice when none was left. the kids loved the view of the LAX runway!
--front desk staff was great on checkout!

Cons:
--the only con was the shuttle van. it took 25 minutes for it to arrive, which after a long flight from NY, and because it was 10p PT / 1am ET, felt much longer!!<//text>< resp>

The first night I arrived I ordered room service: hamburger with cheese, well done, with Cole slaw, The hamburger was still raw inside, came with fries, and no cheese. Bummer. I was too tired to send it back so I ate the edges of the hamburger patty. Dinner in the restaurant the next night was OUTSTANDING!!! Lambchops were magnificent and service excellent! Valet service and housekeeper fantastic!!<//Text>

I stayed at this wonderful hotel during a women's construction conference from Aptil 30-May 3. It was a lot of women from all over; but this Chicago native felt at home. The rooms had great views, very comfortable beds and an awesome staff. The other perks are the restaurants and Starbucks onsite. When I return to Los Angeles for fun, this is where I will stay with the family.<//Text>

I recently stayed at The Gateway (LA) location and had a wonderful experience. I had a unique situation where I was waiting for an extremely important piece of mail to arrive at the hotel. The concierge staff (especially Albert N.) were so attentive, kept me informed on the status of my mail, and hunted it down once it got delivered to the wrong department. Prior to that my credit card had been lost, and while I was waiting for a new one, the check-in staff accommodated me with a room, so that I could check-in with the rest of my group. Food and Drinks were great and the staff can't be beat. Thanks for making this East Coast girl feel at home!<//text>

Had a very good view of LAX and also the swimming pool. Nice king size bed and just okay amenities. The good advantage was the location and free shuttle service to LAX but the downside was only 2 functional elevators for 12 floors which was not practical at all. Well i think it is temporary due to ongoing renovations.</review>

<review>This property is the best LAX hotel because it has everything you need to meet what you are looking for. I have stayed at this hotel for a conference, solo, personal and regular business. It has a Starbucks and a full service restuarant. It has a bar and it has room service. It is large enough to have all these things, but it is small enough to meet your needs. I have probably stayed here 20 times and have stayed in each wing of the hotel with not problems at any one of the four wings.</review></record></dataset><record>

This hotel fit perfect and was clean & comfortable and recognized my SPG Platinum status for wonderful corner suite upgrade (though the bathtub/shower could use an upgrade). Johnathan at the front desk was fabulous and I loved his happy helpful attitude.

The club lounge was a bit disappointing, keys often didn't work, very limited items, and it was difficult getting staff attention for ordering drinks. However it was a convenience that suited our needs for quick coffee & light breakfast before heading out for the day. Evening snacks just as limited but we did grab some soft peanut butter cookies to take to room. . they were VERY YUMMY!

I'm still waiting to hear from Lost & Found regarding a Samsung MP3 Player that I left in our room (1401) & I've left a couple voice mails.

Overall it was a wonderful stay and will return next time in LA & needing an airport hotel.< /Text><Rating>None</Rating>< Name>

From the reservation agents, to the front desk staff, the bar & restaurant staff, housekeeping & the valets for your car....all are first class. I have traveled extensively over 25 years and this has been the best hotel travel experience, bar none. I'm recognized as a Starwood member from the time I make my reservation and throughout my stay and the staff pays particular attention to that designation.
Even if you are not a Starwood member, I have observed the staff and the first class way they treat their guests and are genuinely appreciative that you are staying at their hotel and exemplify customer service to all of their guests.<//text>

The location is very convenient to LAX. Great comfortable beds, though I feel the bathrooms needs a relooking.
The Paparazzi restaurant has a very nice atmosphere, good Italian food and excellent service from Oracio who recognizes his returning guests. Outstanding!
Very nice pool area if one has the time. Good roomy gym overlooking the pool area. Best LAX hotel to me, and it's a real pleasure to see the same staff every time I return. Friendly and good valet service.
The negative would be the lounge. Used to be much better. Running out of food 45 mins before closing time, not good.<//review>

<user_id>None</user_id><Text>I flew in from Atl, GA. My stay was going good, everything was fine until checkout. Front desk employee ran my card and said "declined". I had to pay cash for part of my stay, the reason being was that the hotel put a hold on my card for an amount almost 10x above the normal incidental fee which is $75 (which was more than the cost of my room). Long story short, I would have been stranded in Los Angeles, CA if I didn't traveled with cash. I was not able to use my card because of them. I verified with my bank to confirm it was the Sheraton Gateway. I will continue to be touch with a manager.< /Text>< Time>

I went to the restaurant bar inside after googling for nice restaurants near LAX. The hotel is clean and a bit unspectacular but the restaurant is nicely laid out and modern looking. I got the western burger and the girlfriend the cioppino and we tried the tuna and fries small plates. It was better than I thought it would be. Reasonably priced also.</Text>

I will never recommend this hotel. The staff is so disorganized and have no clue what is going on. Room service is horrible. I am a Vegan they sent me two meat dishes, back to back, and did not even offer to discount it at the end. They over charged me for food and could not find out the transaction number at the end of the day once i noticed my bill.They didn't have simple things in their rooms like a pen. The room was clean and comfortable. The venue itself is beautiful. I just would not trust this hotel with any information of credit cards. In addition, book this hotel for any your business staff members or future board meetings, they are too dysfunctional<//Review>

<text>I arrived at 4pm for check in. I asked the front desk for a single bed room and when I arrived at my room I noticed 2 beds, I also asked for a non smoking room, the room smelled like an ash tray. I called the front desk to ask for a different room and no answer. I paid for parking and the ticket that was given to me did not work. Needless to say, I left the hotel 3 hours after checking in and did not return!! And to add further insult, I was charged an additional 75 dollars for incident purposes. Al though I did not stay at the hotel....Charge is still pending 3 days later. I called the accounting department and the young lady that answered the call was unprofessional and rude! Worst customer service ever!!!!< /text>< Gmap_id>

What a stay! I have stayed here a few times before and been very satisfied. This stay was the best by far. It was like the staff knew that I needed a little extra attention. Everything I asked for was taken care of without complaint or delay. The stay culminated with the breakfast and it did not disappoint. Hector S. took care of me like I was at his house and he wanted me there. He was there to make sure I had a good breakfast and I did. I will stay at this hotel every time I'm in LA from here on out.<//Text>

<review>On the second night of my 2-night stay, my hotel room had a strong smell of smoke, coming from the vents, and perpetrated the entire room within an hour. The hotel personnel determined that the smell was from the vents. I was moved to a different room on a different floor. However, it is completely unacceptable that the ventilation system in the rooms are open to harmful and unregulated air and atmospheric pollution. This is supposed to be a non-smoking hotel. If there was such a strong smoke smell coming from the vents, I am worried about what else I might have been exposed to. 

This is a very concerning issue, but the hotel staff did nothing beyond 'apologizing for the inconvenience'. This is also unacceptable.<//review>< Pics>

It was a fairly good experience, but for the high price I expected way better. The lobby was lovely but the room was a bit small and shabby, although the bed was comfy. Room service was nice and the breakfast buffet was excellent. Parking was awful, expensive and located way around the corner from the hotel, which made walking with luggage difficult. All in all, an okay experience.</Text>

< Review>
I wanted to watch a movie on my TV the first night. It wouldn't work. It wasn't 12:45 in the morning. I asked the front desk person to send someone up ONLY if it was going to be fast. She said 3-4 minutes. I said are you sure, because if not I will start watching something else. 20 minutes later no person. I call back, she said he's with a guest and will be up shortly. Incredible. He arrives 10 more minutes later. He didn't know it was something wrong with my TV, so he said he had to now get his "TV Tools." The liar (lady) at the front desk said that she told him it was about the TV. When he came back, he said that she never told him about the TV. He stayed for 30 minutes and could not fix the TV. 90 minutes wasted, still no movies. I asked the technician to send someone in the morning to fix because I was going to be out all day. At 1 PM the next day no one had come yet. So I call liar #2, Merly. I told her that I was told that this would be fixed in the morning, but that it still wasn't. I said I was going to be out of me room from 1 PM - 6 PM, and to please have someone fix it. She assured me it would be fixed since there was 5 hours to do it. I arrive back in my room from a long day and again, want to watch a movie. STILL DOESN'T WORK. I call the front desk and the new manager gets on the phone — Liar #3 (name sounds like Tavares). He said that it was a Lodgenet problem, and that he had contacted them earlier and that they should be solving this any minutes. I asked to to call them and then call me back with an update in the next 10 minutes. He said he would. I call back insteand in 20 minutes, and he told me that someone is driving out with a new box. Would be about 30 minutes more. 1 hour later, he still doesn't give me an update, and there is still no box, and so I call him back, and he tells me that they're now not coming and that they will be there in the morning. The front desk staff is FILLED with liars. My TV was never fixed. Oh, and did I mention that I was in the Presidential Suite. Imagine how to treat people that are in "regular" rooms. I feel bad for them.< /Review>

This has been one of my favorite places to stay in LA. However, I have begun to notice a downward trend in the service and amenities over the past few stays. The club lounge used to be always open for a cup of coffee, or bottle of water or even just a spot to relax. Now, if you don't make it there during certain hours, you're out of luck. I definitely won't waste my money on a room upgrade anymore.
Our room this time didn't even seem to be prepared for our stay. Just two towels, and only one packet of coffee (decaf - yuck!).
Seriously, the shine on this hotel has varnished. It no longer stands out from any of the other hotels in the LAX area. Might as well go for the better price somewhere else.</text>

<review>The Sheraton gateway is a comfortable stay with the swimming pool, jacuzzi, gym, bar, and Starbucks! The hotel is located near the LAX airport and is about 30 minutes away from downtown LA. The room is spacious and clean; the service is attentative and the people are friendly. One other cool thing I liked was the option to go green, which basically was a tag you put on your door saying you won't change your towels and get the sheets change, and every night you do it you have the option to get either $5 towards food and drinks or 500 star points, and it is stackable! All in all this one for the books.</review><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

I noticed that guests would leave trash in the elevator and it would remain in there for a few hours.

I also noticed fruit flies buzzing in some of the rooms(8th Floor). My friends had some in their rooms.i did not have any in my room(15th Floor).

The waitstaff inthe Brassiere restaurant were very attentive!< /text>

The hotel is right next to LAX, and not a far drive from Venice Beach or the Santa Monica Pier. The staff was very friendly, and the room service/bar food was the best I've ever had in a hotel. We met some awesome people, including some of the builders/filmers for the X Games, and ended up staying almost an extra week because we enjoyed our stay so much. I will definitely be staying here again! The fitness center was nothing short of amazing and the pool was heated to a wonderful temperature so we could swim comfortably at night.<//review>

An incredible experience today at The Sheraton Gateway Hotel Los Angeles

What an amazing experience tonight! It's a beautiful story. I moved out of my Florida home This past weekend and spent the last three days releasing 14 years of stuff, memories, things, and the energies of Sage, family, friends, girlfriends, celebrations, and transformations..... The "stuff" we collect and gather is not so hard to release but all the memories and stories tug at the heart chords. I arrived back to LA and a few hours after landing had to bring William on an he long drive through LA traffic to play his hockey game at the Toyota Sports Center. I thought the game was scheduled for 7:30pm but when we arrived I found out it was for 10:30pm which meant I had like 3 hrs to kill.
After flying cross country I decided the best option would be to find a close by Starwood property and just hole up for a few hours in a day room. The Sheraton Gateway Hotel was only 3 miles away so William and I made our way over. When we arrived at the front desk the magic happened! One of those special experiences that is so unique to the Starwood brand.
Upon check in we were greeted with the warm smile of Dajuan. We explained our situation and he took the initiative to secure us a day room (which was later upgraded to a full room.) Dajuan's demeanor was so personable and warm. He made us laugh and feel so welcomed. As we talked we learned that we had shared a great experience about 6 years ago at the W Hotel in Westwood. I had hosted a fundraiser for Haiti with the cast of the show "The Office" and he was there working at the event. Small world! We joked and laughed about the great experience! Then he took the initiative to bring out Mustafa, the Director of Guest Relations. Mustafa had earlier in the day hosted a "departure party" for his Direct Superior that had his last day today. Mustafa shared on a very personal level how he got teary eyed when he made his presentation honoring his business mentor. Somehow that promoted me to share my experience of moving out of my home earlier in the day, and how emotional that was for me, and how appreciative I was to come and have such a warm friendly checking experience. It almost felt like I was coming home to my home away from home. I shared with them the experience of how that all the properties all over the world of travel to, even when you go to a country like Vietnam or Bali, the one thing that's always constant is the treatment and the experience of coming into a Starwood brand Hotel feeling so welcome and appreciated. No matter how strange the culture shock, the consistency of the brand and the respect that Starwood pays to the loyal Starwood members always makes me feel like I'm "home."
That led Mustafa to go even deeper on a personal level, and share with me his family's departure from Pakistan 15 years ago when I moved to this country and how difficult the transition was. When there's an opportunity to have a real human experience, a real connection of spirit and kindred soul, it makes me so proud to be part of Starwood. I just wanted to really take a moment to make a statement, that these two employees exemplify success! They are compassionate, sincere, and authentic. I know that they will have a long and prosperous successful career with Starwood, because they imprint all the other employees on the team and set the example. And as I am a 14 year platinum member and a four-year lifetime platinum member I know excellence when I experience it.

When I was a young man my Godmother Gave me this beautiful ceramic piece that simply said "home sweet home" and she told me... "Wherever you go you can simply set this by your bed... In any hotel room, or camp site, under the stars... Or in a house... And it will remind you that we are always home in ourselves" .... I can only say that we are always "moving" and the places and locations become our sanctuaries.... It is the love and the relationships that make a house a home... And so now I travel on. But I bring the love with me... To discover lands I have never seen and to explore places I have never been... Thank you Starwood for being my travel companion... The experience of Dajuan and Mustafa really made a huge difference in my day today. From leaving the place that I called home for 14 years to arriving to a temporary stop-over there and even just giving me two freshly baked cookies at check-in, reminded me of what my grandmother used to do when I would come to her house. When we know this love we can never feel alone again.

Best regards;
Mitch< /Review>

< review>
I stay at this hotel 3-4 times per month and I am consistently pleased with the overall experience. The hotel is well maintained. The fitness center is one of the better facilities you see at an airport hotel. The equipment is well maintained, which is not always the case with properties I frequent. The restaurant and bar staff are very friendly and always remember me and greet me with a smile. Juan who works in the Club Lounge in the mornings is amazing. He is very friendly and always remembers my name. When I walk in for breakfast Juan immediately brings me a glass of skim milk. I cannot say enough about the service provided by Juan. My only complaint is I need to get him to call me by my first name. Front desk staff is very friendly and efficient. The valet recently raised their prices which would be fine if the service provided by the valet was at the same level as the rest of the hotel. The valet is the weak link in the hotel. They are very slow and often times I am waiting to drop off or pick up my vehicle and the valet staff can be seen standing around talking to one another. I find it difficult for the hotel to justify the increase in the price of valet parking. I would be more tolerant if they raised the room night price since I see a greater degree of value with the overall hotel than I do with the valet.<//review>

<text>I was a bit hesitant. I never trust properties near airports, especially major international ones. I had visions of dealing with staff who've been yelled at by a few too many jet-lagged travelers, and fears of trying to sleep with the the constant roar of jet engines bombarding my room. Surprisingly, I found none of that. Even though I arrived at a time when it seemed every room in the hotel was being checked in, I never felt rushed or unappreciated. The staff was incredibly courteous and made sure I was well taken care of. When I got to my room I was astounded by how quiet it was. The scenic view of runways was all that there was to remind me of how close the property was to the airport. Well done, Sheraton Gateway. Well done, indeed.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Flying out of LAX the following morning, we opted to stay at the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles the night before our flight. The hotel is conveniently located in a row of hotels right next to LAX, and offers free shuttle service to the airport, making it a great option.

The hotel is huge, over 700 rooms. Not sure when the hotel was last renovated, but it appears to have been recently, as everything looked and felt pretty fresh. The lobby was an absolute madhouse, with lengthy lines to check in and multiple desk agents handling check-ins, but there was no one in the SPG Gold and Platinum check-in line, so thanks to SPG Platinum status, I was checked in and rolling in about five minutes. This is the first time I've ever actually seen the Elite check-in line used effectively, and I was grateful for it on that day. I wish I could remember the desk agent's name, because he was fantastic, welcoming and accommodating.

We were upgraded to a suite thanks to SPG Suite Nights, and the suite was a large corner space overlooking the airport. Plenty of room to spread out (even though we were only there for one night). My only gripe if I was staying long term would be the inability to close off the sleeping space from the rest of the room, because it was really just one huge room with a separate sitting area. I like being able to separate the living area from the sleeping area, but this really wasn't a concern for us since this was basically a crash pad before a flight the next morning. The room was clean and was appointed in standard Sheraton style.

Overall, we found it to be a bit pricey if we were paying rack rates, but wasn't a bad redemption with points. I believe this hotel is also a major conference center, and would work well for such given its size. If you're looking for a good place to crash before heading to the airport, this is a good option.<//review>

We requested a early check-in at 11:00 am, but when we arrived at 12:00, our rooms were not ready and the front desk staff told us that the rooms would be ready in one hour, finally we waited and checked in until 14:15, what a long waiting time for us (at least we should be noticed earlier for the unavailability of early checkin)....When we were waiting for check-in, we had lunch in a cafe in the hotel, but the cafe told us that we could not put the bill on our stay until we had got a room number...
Also, we dropped by the club lounge at 19:00, but the food at evening hors d’oeuvres was nearly consumed and no refill was made, we felt really disappointed about Sheraton in this trip in Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles, and we will not suggest our relatives or friends to stay...< /Text>

This was my second stay in this hotel. Staff was friendly and responsive to my needs. I had a problem with internet conection in the room, that was solved swiftly. I was in a Club Room, and may be only one robe and few bathroom amenities are not enough for this kind of room. The lounge in the Club Floor was comfortable. And the best of all was an Italian restaurant (I do not remember the name), inside the hotel, that could easily compete with good restaurants placed in Italy in food, wines and price.< /review>

<text>It took us 50 minutes to get on the shuttle bus at LAX. During the process, one shuttle bus even did not stop at the pick-up location.The bus itself was small and had to reject some customers. The worst experience ever. 
The hotel room does not have refrigerator. 
The room is clean. A small plus is the restaurant/bar which runs till 1am which is nice for airport passengers, and offers Chinese dumpling and congee in breakfast, which is considerate to Chinese guests here.<//text><userid>None</userid><gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</gmap_id></record>

We had to stay an extra night in LA because of a flight delay. We found this Sheraton was close to the airport and rental car agency. Check in was fast, courteous. He gave us a credit for a movie to let the kids watch. Room was clean. We were exhausted after a week of sight seeing and the room service was fast, good food. I was worried about being so close to the airport that it would be too loud to sleep. That was not an issue my family slept great. This experience turned out better than the hotel we stayed at for the rest of our vacation.< /review>

<review>If you're looking for a good night's sleep close to LAX, look no further. The beds here are very comfortable, the sheets soft and the rooms clean. The layout of the hotel means you can get to any room with just a short walk to the elevator. Shuttles run from the terminals every 20 minutes, though you can also get there with a $10 Lyft. If you're looking to relax and enjoy your hotel experience, this is probably not the ideal place. No tub in the room, and the shower pressure was too low. Internet speed was terribly slow, even with the paid performance internet (free for Marriott Gold). Then again, if those things aren't important to you, this hotel will work just fine.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>I am currently a lifetime Gold member and come to the LAX area often, for meetings at Los Angeles Air Force Base (I am retired Air Force). In the past, I have enjoyed the club lounge for a quick snack in the morning, which was available when I first became a gold member. Then you changed policies and only let Platinum members go into the club lounge. I eventually become Platinum, but due to recent travel reductions with my company, I lost that level last year. Up until my most recent stay (Jan '13), you provided to me as part of my Government reservation, a complementary b-fast buffet each morning, which I enjoyed. I only ate granola cereal, but it was nice taking my time eating and reading the paper. This past stay, I was told that you no longer provide a free buffet with the Gov't rate. Yes, your hotel is nice, but the amenities that I just discussed is what has brought me back, time after time. I hate to say this, but I'm rethinking my loyalty as you no longer offer what I enjoy. I will be researching different hotel chains to see if they meet my needs, which are very simple, yet very important to me.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Just wanted to say that the remodel that was done to the rooms on the 15th Floor and the Club Lounge are wonderful! The bed was amazing and the layout/look of the room is great!!

Also really like the Club Lounge and the view of the LAX airport/runway...nice to watch the planes take-off and land.

Really great stay and look forward to being there again soon!<//review>

The location here by LAX was perfect and the most amazing thing is that we could not hear the planes flying in and out. Any other hotel that we have stayed in that was near an airport our stay would be disturbed by sound of the air traffic. This was perfect because we were conducting business meetings in our rooms as well as a meeting room on the 2nd floor. The staff here is amazing, from the registration desk to the bellmen to the room service staff. We would recommend this beautiful hotel to everyone! The only difference in opinion between me and my roommate was that her bed was perfect for her but I wished mine had more pillowtop features than it did... but I am older and have more "owies" than she does... LOL! Thank you Sheraton!

Hotel is very easy to get to from the freeway. Room was a very good value. My only concern was the self parking. It's so far from the front lobby that I had to valet since I came in at night and didn't feel safe walking that far of a distance. It wouldn't have been that big of an issue if the valet parking wasn't so expensive.<//Review>

The staff was very accommodating and responsive. The lighting in the rooms was poor. The bathroom lights needs to be stronger. You could not see your clothes in the closet. The bathroom amenities were substandard.Towels were thinning.
The breakfast buffet food should be replenished frequently and one should never see an empty tray in the buffet line. The bagels were so hard and stale that they would break when you tried to pull them apart for toasting. The toaster should be replaced as it burns the top of the bagels most of the time.
Provide ear plugs as the jet take off noise is transmitted through the structure. Gym facilities were excellent for a hotel.<//Text>

<text>Nice environment, very expensive and everything costs to go in and out of the parking lot cost roughly 40$ a day. Also pur room was not cleaned good hope the bed spreads were. The chrome on the sink and tub were not cleaned, the sink was not clean and stained towels in the room. We paid to much for this stay and im not 100 percent happy more so 65%.

The rooms have very poor lighting also. The most upsetting thing is the bathroom door is always in the way since the room is to small. The suites are nice but overpriced for this location.
However the common area's space is wonderful and plenty of it. The buffet breakfast there is great! The The staff is extremely kind and accomodating. The location is great! The overall energy there is really nice, the restaurant Papprazzi is great formerly Don Shula's 347. The Pool area is wonderful. The biggest drawback to this hotel is the HVAC system, the air is always very chalk like in the guestrooms and really bugs my allergies, it seems like the system needs professional work.. I have complained about this repeatedly and nothing has been done yet! I do love this hotel overall great place to stay if you need to be near LAX. When this hotel was a cat 2 it was a great value for SPG points, now it is a Cat 3 or 4 and not a good value for points.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<text>I have stayed at this hotel a number of times and each time they screw up my bill. I get charged for things I did not get. I get mixed anwsers from different people. Self parking is a joke becasue the front desk either does not have the tickets or they give you the wrong price/information. This is the last time I will ever stay here. I will not recommend it to anyone. I have been part of the SPG family since 2002 and this is the worst hotel they have in there chain. To make matters worse, they do not care.< /text>< name>

<Text>I am sorry to say that we were very disappointed and very unhappy with our stay .
Our family of 4 were placed in a very tiny and extremely noisy room. Our children were up until 2:00 am because they could not fall asleep due to airport airplane traffic and neighboring room guess playing loud music. The house keeping staff was rude. Out toilet overflow and no one came to repair it. We checked out of the hotel and the toilet still had not been repaired. We were not satisfied with in house dinning. The food was horrible and over cooked. This was by far our worst stay at the Sheraton hotel. As former employees of the Sheraton Hotel my husband and I were surprisingly disappointed.</Text><rating>None< /rating><UserId.>None</UserId.>< resp>

I often frequent the SPG hotels near LAX, which is great cause there is four in the area and I always look forward to SPG status. I am so closed to Platinum so I have really just started staying at the hotel for no true purpose beyond upgraded status.

The sad thing is that after so many stays and so many dollars spent most of these SPG hotels do very little beyond offering you points. I have experience the true spirit of the program, however the norm is to stick you in a regular room call it SPG level and debate rather not if you can get the late check out...

My recent stay at this hotel was not that bad, thanks, but there was no room upgrade, no comp parking, just my gift of additional points which tend to be getting smaller and smaller compared to my first race to platinum...I stood in line at the "status-Line" and notice that no one pay attention to me or my facial expression of looking at three people get called before me...its annoying that the dedicated line is too busy calling from the general line...yet it is I who have choosing SPG to be and investment and have earned the status that I would like to be recognized for ...

not sure if this program gives what it was intended for, but looking at my AMEX monthly bill and I can assure that it takes..<//text>

Spent 3 Nights here. The room was average. The bathroom could use some updating. Very low showerhead and tiles were a bit dirty.

What prevents me from giving the hotel a better rating was the fact that on two separate occasions the Hotel Staff entered my room without knocking. The first time was a housekeeping supervisor who just walked in. The second was a hotel maintenance person entering on the day of my departure even though my DO NOT DISTURB sign was hung on the outside of the door.

I complained to the front desk staff after both occasions. The first time the front desk clerk was apologetic and offered me a complementary breakfast. The second time, the front desk clerk mumbled an apology.

Other than that the hotel was fairly nice- Food in the restaurants was above average and much of the staff was friendly and helpful< /Text>

My husband and I recently stayed here one night upon returning from Hawaii. We had stayed here before without incident and it is very close to the airport which is convenient and It's comfortable. The following day My husband checked us out at the front desk and returned the key and they asked if he wanted the Folio emailed and he said that would be fine and we received our emailed folio. Two days later we received three more emailed folios with two additional days and a couple of extra charges. I called and whoever answered the first time was NO help whatsoever and I was told to call back two days later and talk to someone in the accounting department because it was a holiday weekend. I ended up calling back later that day and was given a manager. After investigation I was told that housekeeping had said we were still in the room. But he would investigate further and refund and call me back. I did receive a phone call but they didn't leave a message so here I go again calling back. Once again on the first call I got someone who was totally uninterested in helping me and then when I called back again I was put through to another manager and then he put me through to someone else. They kept thinking I had made reservations for three night and I told them that my reservation was only for one night and that I have proof of the reservation. I was finally told that they took 12,000 pts out of my SPG account for the additional nights. I was not happy with that. Then I was finally told that they did have record of us checking out but that someone had checked us back in from the hotel. I asked about the housekeeping story and was told that housekeeping thought we were still in the room. Hummmm if someone was in the room it certainly wasn't us. Then they finally told me they would put my points back in with an additional 3000. And refund us. I'm still waiting to see if that happens. I certainly hope it does and I don't have to call again. Having said all that I'm a bit reluctant to use this hotel again because of this. So I'll probably use another hotel close by. I kept asking what I would need to do in the future to keep this from happening again and I was never given an answer.< /review>

This hotel has great rooms but isn’t good for children. When I checked-in it was past midnight, I had a overtired toddler in my arms and they didn’t offer anything to expedite our check-in. We had to wait around 10 min to get to the front desk. We also had to wait for the crib I called earlier to request. And now that I came back for my child’s nap realized they only left two towels, like toddlers aren’t people who deserve their own towel. They know there are three of us!< /review>

< Review>
I have stayed at this hotel the last three times I visited Los Angeles. Although the room was a tight squeeze on one of my trips (because I was travelling with my spouse and two children), generally the room is very spacious and clean.The staff is always quick to respond to any questions or requests. My last visit, the housekeeping staff actually had to come and strip my linens as my infant had an accident. Not only were they quick to respond but, made sure that I had everything I needed prior to leaving the room. The room service was also quick and courteous. I love this Hotel which is why it is my go to when visiting the Los Angeles area. I feel it is worth every penny. I am returning the week of February 18 and am anticipating the same stellar service. Thank you to all the staff at the Sheraton Gateway.</Review>

<GmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</GmapID><Text>Hello,

My last stay at the Sheraton gateway LAX was awful due to only one thing. Obviously there were one or two rooms next to me "721" that had heavy smokers in the rooms. I say heavy because I do stay in hotels in Vegas where the cigarette smell permeates but not like this. For some reason it was coming in the vent or something cause it was like sleeping next to someone smoking. I complained both nights but not sure what the outcome was. I can't afford to lose sleep when I'm on quick trips and have taken your property off my list of hotels in LA. I sincerely hope that you hear it from other guests and figure it out. 

Having said all that - you have a great staff and the F&B is great.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Best,

<Text>I ordered room service at about 9:00 at night. The meal took longer than stated to arrive (by maybe 10 minutes)-not bad in itself. But then the dinner rolls were microwaved--doesn't the kithcen know that microwaved bread is never a good idea. And, they brought the wrong soup. The server was a very nice guy but when I told him I ordered the split pea soup, he had no idea what that soup was. He said there was a soup that was thick and green and I said yes, that is what I ordered. He brought me the proper soup which was delicious. My sandwich was also delicious but the fries were cold and old tasting. The front desk was very nice as were both hotel shuttle drivers. Very quality staff overll. Just a disappointing meal.</Text><Response>None<//Response><Rating>None<//Rating><gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</gmap_id><pics>None< /pics>< username>

<pictures>None</pictures><Review>I had a meeting at this Sheraton, and got in to LAX the night before the meeting. The hotel shuttle bus was quick to arrive and it was a very short trip to the hotel. Check in took about 15 minutes with about 10 people in line served by 3 registration workers. The room was very nicely furnished. My only complaint is that these days, WiFi should not be an additional cost of $13 per day. A renown hotel like Sheraton should offer WiFi at no additional cost to its customers. My only choice for dining was the Papparazzi Ristorante. The lasagna was excellent, but the total bill ran almost $40 including iced tea and gratuity. The meeting venue was nice (Seminar Room), and the breakfast and buffet lunch spread was very tasty. Once again, the shuttle bus had me back to my terminal at LAX within 5 minutes. Overall, it was a very nice stay.</Review><userid>None</userid>< Resp>

<review>The Mega Partnering Organization came and bought 40 companies from around the world.
Guest speakers were Al Pacino, Sylvester Stallone, Ms. Mone of South Africa, Dr. Quebein and many more. The service was terrible. The wait time to be srved food was terrible. The attitudes of the staff were inadequate. I'm not exaggerating. I'm a easy person to get along with. But, even I lost my temper after 5 days of this treatment , when the average business owner flew more than 6 hrs. most flew 16 hours to attend.<//review><rate>None<//rate>< date>

This hotel is in a great location. The hotel staff, valet, restaurant, and fitness center met my needs. The standard room was neat and quiet; all the ammenities and fixtures worked. The only negative about the hotel is wireless internet is only available for a charge in the rooms. I would like to see that changed in the very near future. Overall, I had a great stay at the Sharaton Gateway Los Angeles.<//review>

<Rating>None< /Rating><text>The Sheraton Gateway has so much potential to be the perfect hotel for a business traveler, but it falls short on a few critical operational elements. While its proximity to LAX is unmatched, it takes forever for a shuttle bus to arrive at the airport. It is common in the evenings that one bus will be running while three sit idle in the parking lot. Next, there is a dedicated SPG line at check in but there is rarely anyone staffing the desk in front of it. The other one or two desks routinely process the non SPG members first while we stand there trying to get their attention. Finally, the internet connection in the rooms often do not work properly and the IT company help desk takes so long it just isn't worth the effort. These few issues mar an otherwise fantastic great value property with friendly service, spacious and comfortable rooms, and good food, especially the room service.< /text>< Pics>

Customer service needs improvement both over the phone and in person. They are rude and very disrespectful come off really a arrogant and domt want to help. When asked to speak to. Management they were ok promised to help resolve the situation and as soon as I left the state to come back to Canada the promises were reversed and broken. I will not recommend or stay here again not in th USA or canada I will let others know of the poor service as well. Very disappointing considering the hotel is very well put together.</Review>

BED BUGS!
We stayed overnight in this hotel and it has turned out to be a terrible experience. The hotel has a bad case of bed bugs. After sleeping on the bed overnight we started saw that we were getting small bumps and were really itchy. Staying at this hotel ruined our week vacation as we were very uncomfortable for the rest of the week. After informing the front desk of the bed bugs in the room I was told they would fumigate and contact us within 24 hours. A week later and we did not hear back. I called to follow up and there was no trace of my complaint. I was transferred to a house keeping manager that was very rude and said having redness and small bumps after sleeping in a bed is not enough of an excuse for it to be bed bugs. Please don't make the same mistake we made. AVOID THIS HOTEL.</Text>

<Review>Easiest hotel stay ever! Booked on-flight an hour before arrival, hopped on the shuttle to the Gateway, checked in, had dinner @ Italian restaurant Paparazzi (downstairs), nightcap at the bar and comfortably slept. Through out, the staff were very friendly and polite (especially at the bar with our weird requests!) This is how an airport hotel should be - efficient, smooth, and simple.</Review><rate>None<//rate></record></dataset><record>

Extremely poor service 
Arrived at the hotel on June 7, around 11:30 pm and there was only one person at the front desk for check in
There was a long line of 12-15 people waiting for check in and I was the first and only one in the SPG Gold & Platinum line. 
There were multiple guests calling management complaining and trying to be heard. After 20 minutes in line I finally checked in and...surprise! when we got to the room it was dirty!!! 
Back to front desk and after apologies, and the promise of a credit to our account, we got a second room
Today June 8, after all day long out, we came back to our room to find out that it was completely unkept, no fresh towels, no toiletries.
We called customer relations asking for soap and fresh towel, after 40 minutes nobody came to room and I had to go down to front desk again. They apologized again this time the manager and another promise of credit to the account.
We are experienced travelers and never have had such a poor service anywhere in the world 
Sadly we had the perception that nobody there were empathic with us or even care about the multiple problems and complaints.
Truly the worst hotel stay ever</Review>

< Review>
This hotel has potential to be so much better.

1) they charge a ridiculous amount for valet parking. Not great for residents with cars in a city where you need a car.

2) despite the fancy looking reception and reasonably high level service from front desk the hotel corridors (5th floor) smell funky and are crying out for a new carpet.

Although the rooms are a good size and there is a decent fridge and a TV which is just far too big. There are other issues.

3) The curtains don’t close properly in the centre and either side and this lets daylight in, not great if you’re jet lagged.

4) there is no kettle in the room, just a coffee maker which isn’t great if you want tea. Although Starbucks in reception were great at providing hot water. Inconvenienced yet.

5) the only mirror in the room is situated behind the bathroom door and in the smallest space of the entire room. Not great.

6) the pool is nice, the sun beds are a little old and there is loose gravel on the surface of the pool area which isn’t nice if you’re bare footed. There are a couple of big annoying trees blocking parts of the lounge area.

Positives are, good gym, decent equipment and open 24/7. Nice enough staff. good location to airport but with annoying parking cost and outdated parts of the hotel I’d stay elsewhere next time.</Review>

The exceptional service first started from the Valet service, when I arrived, Roosevelt Beasley gave me a professional, warm welcome, and for the rest of the week the valet team was fast,friendly and professional. It was also nice to see some females working valet. I will stay at this hotel again and I had a great time!</review>< username>

While my stay at the hotel was satisfactory, my experiences after leaving have been dreadful. When I arrived home, I realized I had been over charged for valet. When I called in to get this resolved, I could not get in touch with the accounting department. I left multiple messages over 2 weeks, none of which were EVER returned!! I then called the manager of the hotel. While he was able to take the extra charges off, when I asked for a new receipt for expenses , I was told that it was most likely NOT possible. He said he would call accounting and I would receive a call back. Yet again, I never received a call back from accounting or the manager. I just now called for a 6th time to the hotel, and only got a voice mail again. This is 100% unacceptable customer service.<//text>

<Text>Had requested a late arrival. Called from airport to ensure two reserved rooms were close to each other. Front desk stated they had reserved rooms next to each other for us. When arrived at hotel, they gave my husband and I a room 2 floors away from our kids. When I arrived to my room, bed was not made and not cleaned from prior guest. When I called front desk, attendant was annoyed at me for calling! It was midnight and we were tired. Waited for it to be cleaned. Then attendant refused to let us stay in that room after we waited and gave us a handicap room<//Text></record>

Hotel was pretty standard and clean. Check-in was fine other than finding an overnight guest has to pay $50 for valet and the self parking was a long walk in a dark area away and was still like over $20. I did valet and when I got my car back they had taken my lights off auto, which I never do. Then when I went to my car at the LAX parking lot after my flight my battery was dead. I then called the hotel and very politely asked if given the circumstances someone from their valet could come over (less than a mile away) to give me a jump. I figured they wouldn't, but instead of nicely saying "no" the lady got super defensive and confrontational about it. Saying stuff like "so you are assuming we turned your lights on" which yes that is exactly why I was calling with such a unique call, but if she just said simply "no we can't and sorry about the situation" it would have been 10x more professional.< /Review>

This use to be my favorite hotel near the Los Angeles airport.
My stay on Aug 1,2015 was awful. My first room had hair on the floor, hair in the tub, and hair in the bed. The room was filthy!!! The second room was dirty too. Hair in the tub and dirty sheets. Third room was clean. This hotel has new owners and it appears cleanliness isn't a priority.
This is the first time in 20 years of traveling I have ever ask to change room because the room was dirty.</Review>

Let me start off with the fact that I travel frequently both internationally and domestically. I understand that sometimes things go wrong or that you don't get the top of the line service every time, and that's understandable. I've stayed at this hotel a few times and each time I have had issues. I stayed once again hoping that my experience would be better. It started off well with the staff having a room for me early in the day. They were kind and welcoming. But that was the end of it. Here are the issues I encountered this stay as well as past stays:

1. The shower in my room would not drain. The shower would fill up about 2-3 inches and once it drained, it would leave stuff from the drain all over the bathtub. This has been an issue the last two times I've stayed.

2. I ordered the quiche lorraine and had tons of egg shells in it.

3. The shuttle for the hotel pulled up (I was behind it in my car) and it stopped in the middle of the valet area which did not allow me enough space to get around. It stayed there for at least 5 minutes while I sat in my car unable to use the valet. What's the point of valet if I have to sit and wait, especially if I am paying $28/night.

4. My tv frequently would lose video and audio. I would say it was every 5-10 minutes. It would turn off and then on again.

5. When checking out, I wanted to get an updated receipt. I stood in line for at least 15 minutes waiting. As I waited in the starwood preferred line, people were waiting in the regular hotel guest line. The front desk allowed 5 different people to walk up and assisted them as I waited even though I had been next in the starwood line for a significant amount of time. The lady in front of me who was being helped was allowed to stay on her cell phone the entire time slowing the process down significantly. Finally when I got to the front desk, the attendant said nothing to me at all, not even a hello. You figure that if someone was waiting in line for that amount of time, the attendant would at least provide a greeting. I asked for my receipt which took another 3-4 minutes. Now typically I am not an unpatient person, but I was frustrated at this point. The attendant handed me my receipt and said goodbye. One word. Not the service I expect.

I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.</Review>

<text>One of the many hotels located in close proximity to LAX. The outside doesn't look like much but it is very nice inside and the people who work there are pleasant. The beds are some of the comfiest I have ever slept in. My only complaint is the elevators and how long they tale given the size of the hotel.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><userid>108095595222624763007</userid>< name>

<Text>I made reservations for 1 night as we returned from Hawaii and had a layover.

I had called ahead of time to let them know we would not be arriving until late in the evening, and please hold our room, they stated no problem. We arrived at the hotel at 11:00 pm, and the girl at the front desk stated they were sold out and didn't have our room.

I was a little ticked! After about 10 minutes, she stated she could give us a king room, (I had a reservation for 2 double beds) I told her that would have to do, I was exhausted!

We get up to our room, there is trash in the trash cans, used candy wrappers on the bathroom floor, and when I got in the shower, there was not any soap, shampoo or body wash! Only a bottle of conditioner!

This is not what I expect from a Sheraton!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<text>DON'T BRING YOUR CAR.  The other reviews are right!  Parking is a joke.  Here's a tip:  Cars don't make sense here.  There is a free shuttle to and from the airport (all terminals) that runs 24/7 every 20min.  Use that to get to and from the airport.  You will pay more to park the car than to rent it!  One reviewer says that they wanted $28 per day but the actual rate is $38 Plus Tax!  I noticed that one guy was paying only $18 but that's still Way too much.  Now, if you need to go somewhere else, you'll need a car and once you have one, you don't have to stay near the airport.  You're free to go somewhere else and that car will pay for itself.  (Hotel is actually much Closer than the rental car agencies so you'll pass it on the way to get your car!)

The hotel staff was friendly and helpful.  Room was nice and clean but small and had no safe.  Typical high-priced internet that barely works.  Typical $3 bottle of water in room.  Breakfast was included for me but be careful if it's not included for you.  You'll pay $50 for 2 (not including tip) and since it's buffet, a couple might pay $50 for just two cups coffee.  Room rate was mid-priced (not cheap but not over-the-top) but they will get you for parking.  Remember:  If you have to have a car, don't stay here.  If you can get by without one, this place isn't a bad option.  As for the view:  You're a block from one of the busiest airports in the world -what do you expect?  You'll see rental car parking lots, commercial freight companies, and other rooftops.</text>< time>

Your vegan friendly food was amazing. Your staff went out of your way to make sure we had soy milk for our coffee in the lounge every morning(suggestion: have soy or almond milk be the default so they do not have to come out and pour this each time someone does not want cow's milk).</review>

This is only based on one experience but this may have the single best hotel experience I've ever had. The valets are friendly and generally awesome, they're not apathetic or just hunting for tips. They earn them. The front desk folks were fantastic and accommodating. The room was pretty impressive too, user-friendly TV and environmental controls, decent bathroom, comfortable furniture, and the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever been in! Room service made me feel like a celebrity and the food was awesome. Don't take my word for it and certainly don't let a crummy airport experience get in the way of having a great time in this place.<//text>

Only suggestion is that all your valet staff have suggetions to surrounding restaurants. We had to ask a few people to get information. But when we did it was a great recommendation.

<review>Typically I love gateway. This time no way
1. Mold on top of shower
2. Rust on shower head
3. Poor bell service
4. Waited in preferred line for 15 minutes while others were getting service
5. They gave me a room that had people in it after bringing all the luggage up to the room
Disappointing. My room was looking dated...

The moment I arrived at the hotel lobby there were 4-5 people ahead of me for check-in. While there were 2 staffs doing their job to accommodate as fast as they can, one staff was on the computer.

I'm amazed that the room did not have a fridge neither a microwave. Although, there was a safety deposit box for valuables, I can't believe that a fridge and a microwave were nowhere to be found! Maybe, my standards and expectations are set too high for this hotel? Please comment. Thanks.<//text>

Excellent rooms, friendly staff, great food, fitness center has a lot of equipment and should be an ideal place to workout. However, half of the cardio equipment are not working properly. I reported it several times in previous stays and it seems to be getting worse every time I visit. If this could be fixed, I would recommend this as the number one place to stay in LA.<//Review>

There was an issue with ants being in my room. I had to request a new one. The ants were all over the door of my room. I didnt realize it until I woke up one morning and my unfinished drink had ants around it. Ew! I got a new room, but the damn heat didnt work. It was blowing cool air. I gave up on trying to get another room at that point and complaining. I just dealt with it.</text>

<Review>We stayed here for just one night as we had early LAX flight. The hotel is one of the closer LAX hotels which makes it nice spot for late arrivals.. etc. The rooms are nice and seem to have been renovated recently. There is valet parking as well as self park with in and out for around $17 i believe. There is a nice hotel lounge perfect for a late night drink.

By far the only complaint we had is we tried printing out our boarding passes and it seemed to take forever at the nearby computer cluster but when we tried to print it asked for our credit card as if it were going to charge us for printing and when we asked front desk he said that shouldnt happen but didnt really provide us with resolution so we decided to print at airport next morning etc.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

< Review>
We arrived at 10PM at night after traveling all day. We were helped quickly and given our room key. Instead of a king sized bed there were 2 double beds. We had to go back down to the lobby and wait in line again to get the proper size bed that we had requested. The clerks comment was "I thought that room was a king". Normally this is no big deal but we were exhausted after a long travel day so having to take additional time was frustrating.
We had dinner our second night at the hotel at Paparazzi (sp). We had eaten there on a previous trip and enjoyed a very good meal but this time it was very disappointing. My husband had about 2 bites of his pasta and sent it back. He was offered another choice but he declined. We had expected a much better meal especially since it was the last night of our vacation< /Review>

The bar tender was very surly when asked what draught beer he had available. His response "only Pilsner" this I believe was all they had every night.
The front staff did not know how the local transportation system worked, i.e the buses and the Go Metro. I did explain them to him as I have visited your area at least 5-6 times.< /text>< Pictures>

<Rating>None<//Rating><Review>I have frequent this hotel nine times within a period of 60 days and this was the stay that ruined it all for me. I have always been granted club level access regardless of the floor, so shockingly enough I went to the front desk to asked if I could gain access, once becoming aware that I could not get on the 15th floor. I was told that there was a fee, and I stated that I was not familiar and this has never been the case previously, (my status is gold, but I am very close to platinum, and I had committed my stays to this particular hotel) the rep. told me to give the names of the employees who have given me access in my previous visits, I announced that my job is to pay the hotel and not keep track of who check me in (clearly he knew that was a question of disrespect) The employee took my card and swiped the computer, I added that the computer would show that I had been there a great amount of times, and SPG has plenty of options at the LAX area. at that instance my card was thrown to the ground, so I immediately requested the manager, the rep. storms off and slams his fist to the door, shortly after the manager someone whom I assume was the manager approached and was kind, but had no clue on how to appease or resolve the lack of customer care. In short I was forced to wait for a new hotel card to be program cause the manager refuse to just give the card that was on the floor near his feet I assume, all while the rep. stood there laughing, So this was reported to SPG and I was given a response from the hotel mostly focusing on the access to the club floor and totally avoiding the lack of respect. I responded stating that this was beyond free crackers and boiled eggs, I am now waiting for SPG to contact me. The rep. who did this had a bandage wrapped on his left arm (so be aware)</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</gmap_id></record>

One comment: The hot water system could be modernized. I arrived in the early afternoon, received a room at the end of a wing (1002), and had just warm water. The maintenance guy said to let it run for ten minutes. He was correct! But, with water scarcity as it is, that's not environmentally friendly.< /text></record>

<Review>I was expecting a standard airport hotel but what I received was anything but. From the moment we entered this hotel, it had a feeling of luxury and the staff attentiveness matched the feeling of luxury. There was nothing they could not accommodate and they did it with a smile. Even when we were getting ready to check out, the housekeeper offered us two bottles of water to take along with us on our trip to the airport. While we were here for only one evening, I look forward to returning and recommending to my friends.<//Review>< Pictures>

Oldish hotel, well located with an efficient shuttle system, but really outdated facilities. It is quite disappointing for a hotel with the Sheraton name on the front door.</Review>

My service I received was great. I saw some abrassiveness with the staff that could be tuned up. Remember these folks are your customers. Patience should be key. Having stayed in hotels all over the place, I was actually very surprised to see the errors that were made this past week. I hope management listens and has a staff meeting.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<rating>None</rating><Text>Ok hotel but considering that i had heard such nice things about it i was a little disappointed. Staff was courteous i guess but as the hotel is busy the service always felt rushed. Got one word answers to my questions and felt they had bigger and better things to do. Room was ok but felt old (as did the whole hotel). The chair by the desk had a rip in it and the bathroom could use a redo. But mostly just didn't feel as fresh and clean as the other starwood properties i have been to recently. I liked the outside pool area and cabanas especially with the fire going nightly. The inside bar is just a big open area with very little ambiance. I actually stayed here for three nights which is unusual for this hotel but as I was going to be all over LA I figured this spot was as good as any - in that sense it did work out. Overall was a bit disappointed I don't think I would stay here again if I had a three night trip and I would probably check out another one of the airport hotels to see if they might be better before returning to this one.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>I stayed here for 2 nights using SPG points, but I was given the option to ugrade to the club floor, which included evening snacks and continental breakfast. The first room allocated to me hadn't been cleaned! Although this was swiftly changed it was a pain as I had lots of heavy luggage to drag around. The pool area lacks privacy and has to be reached via the bar area.There is a frequent, free shuttle to the airport which is only a 5 minute ride away. I have stayed here many times and the hotel is in much better condition that others close by e.g Crown Plaza</text><user_id>None< /user_id><pics>None</pics></record>

<username>caity< /username><Text>I have stayed at this hotel before and had great service but this time it was different right from check in. I arrived by myself with three very large bags that were far too heavy for me to carry comfortably on my own. There was no bell person in sight to help out. There were two desk attendants and a line up when i arrived. Neither were polite or friendly and one was even quite rude to the guest in front of me when she stepped ahead before the agent was ready to deal with her. There were no explanations upon check in ("the elevator is there... the gym is there...") but I knew where everything was. They saw how much difficulty I was having with my luggage and didn't offer any assistance, just watched me awkwardly scramble to pick them up and barely make it to the elevator. When I arrived at my room with bags in tow, my key didn't work. I was so frustrated at the thought of having to haul these large bags back downstairs all by myself. I tried the card many times and no luck. Finally a staff member walked by, seeing I was having trouble with my key and bags and again didn't offer any assistance. I had to stop him and ask for help, at which point he was helpful in showing me that you have to bend the card and jam it in the door to open... that probably needs to be fixed and should be explained at check in. The room itself was clean and comfortable but I will question staying here again after this lack of consideration from all staff I encountered on this stay. i have previously had good experiences at the Sheraton LAX so this is unfortunate. There was one very polite bell boy who helped me bring my luggage to my car from the desk the next morning, which I appreciated.< /Text>< time>

<resp>None< /resp><review>The downside first: Even though the hotel has ample parking space, it doesn’t allow free parking for guests. So, if you are bringing/renting a car, you would have to pay 45$ + TAX + whatever you choose to tip for the mandatory valet “service” to park your car in the hotel compound or use a nearby parking lot for 35$ and walk back. They also have hourly rates.

The issue is nobody wants a valet service to park their car 3-4 yards away. This isn’t a downtown hotel, so the valet service is really unnecessary or at least it should have been optional. Most of all it should have been well explained on the website or during the phone call we had upon booking. Otherwise being told at check-in late in the afternoon, at which point we were too exhausted to do anything about it, felt like a gotcha moment which forced us to pay additional fee to park our car.

The hotel is nice and updated – we got a specious room and comfortable bed, but we had the duvet changed because it had small stains. It has a Starbucks, a cozy pool and Jacuzzi area and a lively bar with a good service. The location is very close to the airport which is ideal if you are transiting overnight but might feel far for shopping and the like. Since we rented a car, the location was not a deal breaker for us.

I would stay here again if I'm not renting a car.<//review><user_name>GAM</user_name>< Gmap_id>

<Review>From front desk to waiter at the restaurant, all the employees are extremely friendly and helpful.

I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times. SPG Platinum recognition at the hotel is really good. They proactively describe/explain all the benefits - I do not have to ask any questions at all.

Among those employees, the front desk manager and the waiter (who remembers me well) at the breakfast restaurant are the best. They just go beyond to provide excellent customer service.

One downside is their parking situation. It's not the most convenient location...< /Review>< pics>

They were in the middle of a huge remodeling effort and it was very inconvenient because of that. I would not of rated the hotel low because of that alone. The staff was very rude. I think they were tired of all of the issues. We had numerous issues with the parking passes and being double charged. While I was trying to get a double charge fixed the staff person told me I was out of line. She would not reverse the charges until I apologized. I have never been disrespected like that by hotel staff. Lots of choices in hotels near the airport. Steer clear of this one.</review>

Staff was attentive (shower drain was clogged when we arrived and they fixed it promptly), housekeeping staff was very pleasant and helpful. Walls are paper thin, particularly between adjoining rooms and there is no sound barrier on bottom of adjoining door. Our neighbors were quite loud and it was a problem. Lots of hallway noise also. Bathrooms need updating, shower was very weak. Room was small, but nicely furnished and beds were nice. Gift shop terribly expensive for even the smallest things (like stamps). Pool area and deck chairs were great. Jacuzzi is tiny but great for a party of 2. Onsite food/drink too expensive.

<Review>I was in the renovated room and it was good. The room is very well lighted and the renovation was very obvious as almost all the features are working well. However, prior to our checkout, the water was out. We were offered a new room but since we have a lot of luggage it was difficult for us to move to the other room. Also, the wireless internet is not working well which I would recommend that you make sure this feature is resolve for people who travel for business like me. Anyway, my overall stay was good and I will recommend the hotel.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

This is our second occasion where we have stayed at the Sheraton Gateway prior to departure from Los Angeles. One would hope that the first positive experience was no accident and that the second stay would be as trouble-free. That was certainly the case. If anything, we had a better experience because we were able to avail ourselves of the restaurant and bar on this stay. This is truly a class act of a hotel.</Text>

I expected more from a 4 star hotel that was represented. The front desk was rude at check in when I asked about parking. The tub didn't drain you had water up to your ankles after shower. The bed was not comfortable at all. Back parking lot was dark at night when you walked back late. Be sure to make revservation through hotel and not third party you don't get the same treatment as a first class guest. Thats why we were stuck in a room right by elevator and it sounded like a party in the hall all night when people came in. Didn't sleep well at all. We were celebrating our 20 year wedding anniversary so I was disappointed. All the other reviews were great so that made me even more disppointed.< /Text>

Horrible experience here!  Looks beautiful but their customer service needs serious work. This is supposed to be a non-smoking hotel but the guests were smoking like a chimney and the smoke was coming to my room through the vents. My complaints did nothing and when asked about my experience,  I told them again why it was not great and the customer rep offered me disgusting coffee to make the situation better.  I mean seriously coffee? I won't be back!< /Review>

At least the room is new, modern and comfortable. Unfortunately that isn't the only important thing to consider. The check in staff were dismissive, fake and did not recognize my status. There was an issue with my reservation and I was treated like an inconvenience. On my last visit here, I ordered room service and paid $75 for a dry burger and salad. It was not good and it was $75!!!!!! I also called "at your service" in the room and asked a very straightforward question and again was dismissed. You can have nice rooms but it's the staff who make this an awful stay...< /Text>

<rate>None<//rate><review>There was a long line and wait to check-in when I arrived after 10pm. Otherwise, the hotel stay was fine, for a quick overnight before catching an 8am flight.

However, the shuttle service to the airport was very disorganized - I'm not sure if this is the responsibility of the hotel or by a third party. The shuttle was late, and there were over 15 people in line. The shuttle could not accommodate everyone (I was the last to get on) despite people being willing to stand. The shuttle driver did not inquire about airlines and did not call out terminals. As I saw we were zipping by the terminal I needed, I yelled out "Aren't you going to stop at Terminal 2?" He abruptly stopped and to my surprise, I was not the only one who needed to get off! Considering the number of hotel airport shuttles I've taken in my years of business travel, this was totally unacceptable. So beware if using the shuttle service to the airport!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<rate>5</rate><Text>I have stayed here several times over the past year but never took the time to write a review.  I know how important reviews are to a business so my apologies for the delay.

I stayed there this past weekend.  The staff is good-looking, well-dressed, personable, nice and professional.  The hotel is clean and the rooms are spacious.  Starbucks is on the premises - a big plus for me!!!!  The breakfast buffet was great with nice selections.  Our chef (he's going to be mad with me because I forgot his name....bald guy) was very engaging and made our party of 4 some mean omelettes!  The club lounge has a great view and is very relaxing with ample snacks.

It's the best hotel in the area....centrally located with brand name stores nearby to shop.  I  love how the bar area is set up and how it opens up to view outside and you can feel the cool breeze. It gives you a feeling of being outside while inside - great atmosphere.  The pool-side cabana's (not sure if that is what they are called) are such a nice touch and allows for some privacy while being in a public area.  I love everything about this hotel.

The concierge was a pleasant man with so much patience. The waiters in the restaurant were all friendly.  Mark (manager ?) is so down to earth and personable and he made my weekend with the extra touches in my suite for my bridal shower. He went over and beyond. Besos!  The supervisor (Sasha) is a beautiful young woman, inside and outside. She is attentive, warm, and engaging with staff and customers. She was pulled every which way and handled each concern with individualized attention. She's always smiling and such a joy whenever I visit.  I have never stayed anywhere else and don't plan to. Please pass on to management what a great team he/she has as the face of the Sheraton. They are the first ones on the line and leave the first and last impressions for your patrons. I don't know how much is considered when suggestions are made but Mark and Sasha deserve a raise, commendation, certificate, award, etc....or whatever sort of recognition is done, because they represent what the business is all about - pleasing the guests.  They are a big part of why I refer people; keep coming back to your hotel and bringing more people with me. Outstanding job all the way around.  Keep up the good work.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1532624397984, 'text': 'Darlah, we don’t mind that it took you more time than you hoped to write such a thoughtful review of your experience with us.

After having some issues with the lack of availability for parking due to close proximity with the Airport, Jonathan (assistant manager) and Sasha (front desk) were able to give me a discounted rate. You may not know what kind of bad day I was having, but it was terrible. Once they noticed that I was having a hard day, they truly made me feel welcome, not only to the wonderful hotel, but also to the city of Los Angeles. Sasha even provided me EXCELLENT dining recommendations. 

And to top it off, the suite that I stayed in was by far the best I have stayed in during my time with staying at SPG hotels (and even outside of SPG to be frank!). 

I had an excellent on night stay and I will undoubtedly stay again at the Sheraton Gateway! 

THANK YOU SASHA S. AND JONATHAN.< /text>

My children were evacuated from the Woolsey fired last night.
This amazing management welcomed my children and grand children
They graciously allowed them to bring their small animals in.
As well as giving the free Breakfast.
They said the hotel is beautiful, clean and comfortable.

We stayed on the 10th floor in an executive suite. The suite was very spacious. However, we were not able to get any sleep due to all the strange noise in the middle of the night (from 1:30am thru about 5am). Hair dryer noise at 1:30am??? Sounded like from next door. Door slamming. Worst of all, we could not get out of the parking lot because their machine at the exit was not working. We had to park again and walk back to the hotel to get someone to help us. We ended up missing our flight because of this delay/hassle.<//text>

Came in late from Hawaii. Used SPG points! Near the airport & easy to find from the parking lot.. Wonderful Tuna Cobb salad - made at our request @ 10 pm. Rested well. Great work out room. The pool was sooo warm. Best swim I had in two months.</Review>

Near airport but noise and fumes are a concern.
Stayed on 2 separate bookings. Arrived for breakfast first morning at 9;30 after 11hr flight from UK the night before to be told I had to use Lounge BUT breakfast ended there at 9;30 which shows little recognition of caring for long haul guests with jetlag and need to sleep. No breakfast option before 6;30am so useless for early flights. As SPG Platinum I was expecting either Lounge breakfast or Dinning room but neither were open early for any sort of for breakfast. Lounge is poor and not that friendly.Range of food is very limited and one of the worst I have used. Made tea several nights and milk was either curdled or had run out. Other Sheraton/Marriott hotels near airports are more considerate to needs of guests who fly.</Text>

I have stayed at this hotel several times - both prior to its renovation and afterwards. I must say they have done a really nice job with the hotel appearance, especially the rooms. They have a very fresh, modern and comfortable feeling to them and provide for a great night sleep.

Sadly the part of this hotel that continuously misses the mark for getting an excellent rating is their front desk. It continues to be woefully understaffed at late hours and early hours. I checked in at approximately 11:00pm and there were only two employees working the check-in desk and eight customers in line. Further aggravating the situation was the two customers being attended to both had reservation problems. We were tired and just wanted our room. At no time did the staff acknowledge the long wait line. 20 minutes later we finally got our room. In the morning (7:15am) it was no better with only one person working the checkout desk. We finally had to leave without getting our receipt as we were going to miss the airport shuttle.

If Sheraton can fix this problem they'll get my excellent rating.< /review>

<Review>Our experience at the Sheraton is always great no matter where we go. My only complaint is the parking. If parking were available in the premises, I feel this would be the ideal place to stay. Paying $18 a night for parking is a bit much.< /Review>< pics>

<text>Somewhat disappointing for a Sheraton stay.

On the positive side, the location is very convenient for catching an early morning flight from LAX and the food from the Italian restaurant is fantastic. The gym is decent enough and the staff at the reception are friendly and efficient.

On the negative side, not all the concierge staff appear to be interested in helping out with questions. More seriously, my room was dark and smelly and the bathroom was not only poorly lit but could also use a good scrub. There were stains on the carpets, throughout, and the decor and furnishings felt like they were from the 60s.

This was my third of three consecutive hotel stays on the same trip. I didn't come with very high expectations. I was just looking for a nice and clean hotel room close to the airport. This one didn't exactly fit the bill.<//text>< Time>

We called ahead of time for our room to have items in it upon our arrival. The items were not in the room and there were no comments on file.
However, the staff went over and about to make sure our request was met and we received the items within an hour. We would highly recommend the hotel. It's one of the best Sheratons we've stayed at.</Review>

<Text>I reserved a corner suite at a prepaid rate about 4weeks before my stay date. When I checked in I was told that the hotel was oversold and they had no suite for me but offered me a standard room at a discount. Um, no...that will NOT work. Not only am I a platinum member who stays at ths hotel approx 15 times a year, but I prepaid my corner suite room! The manager was called and thankfully he rectified the situation immediantly. Instead of trying to place me in a standard room he upgraded me to a much larger suite, the Presidential Suite. My kids got a kick out of that. I think the employee should have not told me that they were sold out and sorry. If that employee did not know what to do in that situation he should have immediantly deferred to the manager.</Text>< Pictures>

I arrived to LAX late from Central America because of medical emergency en route, so missed my flight to Seattle. Airline had no room vouchers left, so at 2 AM I was on my own til I could fly out next evening. After not eating for 12 hours and being up for 24 hours, I took a chance by taking the Sheraton shuttle, hoping for a room as it was Friday night and most hotels were booked. At arrival, I was told they were oversold and there was no room. As I was leaving, Rudy the Supervisor approached me and asked if I'd mind a conference room and they could bring in a roll away. I was thrilled. I appreciated Rudy thinking outside the box and I was able to have a comfortable place to sleep and eat from their mid night room service menu. I was completely taken care of by the staff, and wanted to express my appreciation.<//text>

The first time I went down to get a new key, I stood in the empty line for non SPG folks as there were a bunch in the platinum gold line. rather than call on me to simply replace my key they skipped over me twice and the guy had a bad attitude. Keep in mind that I have stayed well over 80 nights with Starwood. I will not stay there anymore if I can help it.

<text>I've stayed at this property several times over the past 2 years, and it's never failed to disappoint. Rooms are in excellent shape, staff are always friendly and attentive, and gym was renovated last year to include new equipment.

As a Plat, I've been consistently upgraded to junior or corner suites.

My only complaint is that all the rooms are connecting, and thus, you can hear your neighbor (or his TV) quite easily. But I guess that's on par for airport hotels.</text><Rate>None< /Rate>< Time>

The hotel was great it's the staff that was terrible. Sad to say that the best interaction I had with staff was with a lovely housekeeper with broken English. She went over and beyond to make my room great. The one manager I did speak with did not have the management skills that was expected from "The Best Hotel on Century" He was VERY rude and spoke using a lot of hand gestures. I had the experience of working with a new staff of the front desk and I only knew that she was new because someone was watching her and I questioned it. Her service was very professional no idea she was new.< /Text>

<time>1426723200000<//time><Rating>None< /Rating><Text>The Sheraton Gateway at LAX is a busy hotel for a reason - they do whatever it takes to make sure you enjoy your stay. The Sheraton beds are ALWAYS comfortable and the bathrooms are spacious. The staff take pride into helping out guests whether your request is small or something really time consuming. I have stayed here more than 10 times and one thing is consistent - you will have a good night's rest and leave feeling happy. The bar is a great place for happy hour and Paparazzi is an excellent restaurant to have a business dinner. I have always used the extensive gym and outdoor hot tub at this location and find it a great way to end your day. The club lounge offers hot food and cold appetizers including the best cookies near LAX. Trust me on that one!</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Good location. We had to stay one night and was the perfect location. Near airport, comfortable, good value and free parking.

Didn't liked the price for wifi in room but if you stay upper floor you may get free WiFi from lounge.

Sorry for messy room picture but we are just leaving.</Text><user_name>Olimpiu Galani<//user_name>< gmap_id>

<Review>I have stayed at the Gateway several times over the past year. On our first stay, which was booked through a travel website, my business partner and I met some of the staff at the evening wine tasting. They were delightful and accommodating and reached out to us after our stay in a very professional manner.
Every time I have stayed here it's been a delightful experience and I highly recommend this hotel.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>We arrived in the LAX airport at 10:30pm and had a flight leaving the next morning at 7:30 so we called up this hotel and booked a room. My husband and I had been traveling for the last 20 hours and were a bit crabby, but the staff was still overaly nice to us. They first put us in a room that was conjoined with a conference room that was being used and it was super loud. We called to the front desk and immediately they switched us to a different room with no hesitation. We only ended up being in the room for maybe 6 hours because of our flight but the staff was very attentive and great to work with.</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

My husband travels weekly for business and is a platinum member. I had the unfortunate experience of missing my connecting flight and the airline lost my luggage. When I checked into the Sheraton my husband called to provide his number so that I could have a great stay, they did not put this on my file and the next day they refused to give me access to the lounge and late checkout on the grounds that my last name was not the same. Definitely my worst experience over the past four years when we have had great experiences at other Sheraton locations!<//Review>

I've had consistently good experiences at this property. Quick and efficient check-in by friendly and receptive staff. Rooms are comfortable with usual Sheraton amenities (Shine bathroom products, Starbucks coffee /Tazo tea, Sweet Sleeper Bed) and fairly well kept. Club lounge is also open 7 days a week with a great breakfast spread.<//review>

It was the first time in USA and the stay in Sheraton Gateway LA was a wonderful stay ,from location ,the reception,the concierge,the room service,club lounge.
i would like to thank specially YOLANDA and Evelyn from the reception for their great help and support when we found uncomfortable noise from the bathroom they were patient to change the room in less than 5 minutes and as a SPG gold member they offered me 7000 points as a compliment thank you .
I stayed in the same hotel 4 times in 5 weeks through Jan-Feb.2012 ,there was a complementary luggage storage ,that saved me carrying my luggage and goes around the states.The good thing also is the free shuttle to the airport.</Text>

< Review>
We arrived at 1 am at the airport and expected a short shuttle ride to the hotel. After waiting for 20 minutes I called the hotel and was told to wait as the driver would be there shortly. I should note that ALL other hotel shuttles had passed by several times by this point in time. 35 minutes later and no shuttle so I called the hotel again, only to be told that the shuttle would be there shortly; 45 minutes into the wait I tried calling the hotel only to be met repeatedly by a busy signal. I finally got through at 1:55am and was told that they were trying to locate the shuttle driver. I told them that I was waiting no longer and would take a cab at their expense (which I did). The short cab ride (0.5 miles) was $19 ($15 + $2/suitcase). 
At the hotel there were a number of guests at the front desk. While waiting for the manager to express my displeasure re the shuttle service, a guest at the counter chimed in that they had been taken to the wrong Sheraton and that the driver then wanted $5 to take them to the correct hotel (shuttle service is supposed to be free). Another guest beside me was very upset as he had just had all of his luggage stolen. According to the guest he had set his luggage down and either walked away some distance or turned his back and when he looked around the luggage was gone. According to the guest the security cameras showed a car pulling up, a person getting out, loading his luggage into the car and driving off; the guest was still waiting for the police to arrive an hour later.
The next morning we went to the Club Lounge only to be told that it closed in 5 minutes (at 9 am... no one at checkin had bothered to tell us of the early closing time) and that we had better hurry. At 9 am there were over a dozen people in the lounge with a number of guests arriving at the last minute. Despite the large number of guests, food was removed exactly at 9 am. I dont fault the staff as they have their orders but is management not aware of what is going on in the lounge as the guest requirements obviously are not being addressed?</Review>

Today My 15 year old Son and I arrived at 8am for a three day stay and Sherif was wonderful on finding a room for us for an early check in . While we waited they treated us to breakfast .  Shortly after breakfast Sherif found us a room and my son was fast asleep by 930.
The entire front desk staff was fun and pleasant. I have stayed here before and I will stay here again .  Thanks<//text>

This past month (Feb 2014) we stayed again at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel (LAX) because we had an early morning flight out of Los Angles International (LAX).. We rented a car in Palm Springs (our home town), drove to L.A., check in to the Sheraton Gateway Hotel and return our rented car two blocked from the hotel. The hotel has a free shuttle to LAX that departs every 15 minutes. The Sheraton Gateway Hotel employees are just wonderful, attended to every detail of your stay. We had dinner with friends from L.A. at the hotel restaurant, Paparazzi. It has a wonderful menu that has something for everyone. Our dinner waiter was Kerri Doyle, who attended to every detail of our meal. In summary the Sheraton Gateway Hotel (LAX) is a wonderful choice for an for an easy and delightful way to catch an early flight out of Los Angles LAX airport..< /Text>

Attended a workshop in one of their seminar rooms. Very comfortable chairs and excellent workspaces. Water was provided along with pens and notepads. Speaker could be heard well via their sound system. Parking is expensive, however, and cannot be validated even if eating in their restaurant. Wifi was also unavailable and would have been useful.<//review>

Hotel sold the room we booked and paid for leaving us STRANDED!! We booked and paid for this hotel 2 months prior to our intended stay. We specifically booked at the airport with a guaranteed late check-in as we had an overnight layover. After a 21 hour international flight, we arrived at midnight to a lobby of approximately 15 other guests who were all told the hotel had OVERSOLD THEIR ROOMS! Some had already checked in online! Hotel only offered a lower rated hotel a cab ride away. The airport shuttle just stopped picking up passengers leaving guests stranded! We didn't get to sleep until 4:00am. BEWARE! They will SELL YOUR ROOM OUT FROM UNDER YOU!!!</Text>

<review>Traveling with my 2 year old catching early morning flight. arrived at sheraton gateway hotel only to be met with rude customer service.  Unfortunately when traveling you are in other people's hands and the service really matters. Please train your staff at front desk on providing excellent customer service. Besides that experience the hotel is clean and nice. There are so many other hotels in area so having great customer service is what will bring passangers back.< /review><gmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d< /gmapID>< rate>

<text>This hotel works well for those who want to be near LAX. The friendly staff will go the extra mile to help during check-in, and as a Platinum guest, I have always been upgraded, an important aspect for me to stay repeatedly in a Starwood hotel.

Parking is expensive...and slow. But I found an easy cheap alternative: simply park on the street behind the hotel. This is free, and easy, if you only need to be back to the hotel at 10pm, and if you can be gone by 10am.

I did have two complaints. The biggest is that the elevators are very slow. Either some elevators are not turned on, or there are just not enough to meet the need of a busy hotel.

My 2nd complaint may not matter to many, but I am sensitive to noises, and the AC, especially on auto, will shut on and off throughout the night loudly. I think it is just an outdated system.

On the other hand, the AC does effectively keep the room cool as I like, and the black-out drapes successfully keeps the room dark.<//text>< response>

<text>Just needed to stop by to pick up some coffee from Starbucks. The Valet guy was cool and let me park on the side for 10 min to go in and get my drink. Felt a little pressured but nonetheless thankful for the gesture. Thanks Sheraton.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<user>112268574126267682789< /user><Review>If I could give less then 1 star thats exactly what I woukd give...we came out to visit for a show and from the beginning this was a total waste of hotel the parking is hard to find they do valet parking idk for what id they still charge you regardless if you are staying in their rooms. They also charge you parking each and every time you leave the parking area $17.00 (yes I understand its only 17 dollars ) but if your using your car to get around places you tell me if you would pay 17 dollars each time you go and come in and they do not validate the ticket either its just such an inconvenience. We tried canceling the hotel before hand and they absolutely would not allow it I don't see why not if we were calling a day in advance which it states on their website that ypu have to call at least 3hrs prior to arrival to cancel. Now to get to our room literally the elevator skipped our stop went all the way up and then back down and then we had to go up again I don't understand. And lets just say the Sheraton isn't such  a WOW place. For the price you pay. It was such such an inconvenience that honestly it made us late to part of the show we didn't bother to eat around there or inside oh gawd forbid we get charged an arm and leg for food. So we just left we didn't bother to stay its so upsetting when I booked no where did I locate any info about parking inconvenience and if there is well it must be in micro letters. Honestly folks if your driving in from out of town to LA and LAX and meeting friends whom are flying in from out of town just book your stay somewhere else dont even bother here. Just DONT! it was such such a waste< /Review>< Date>

The staff was very attentive and professional. Location is convenient to airport with occassional noise from air traffic but hardly any problem at all.
The facilities fulfilled my needs and the group rate was reasonable. Wifi free in lobby area was a plus.

Thank you for an enjoyable stay.

<Text>I was dissappointed with the service at the hotel. I requested a short late check out because I was presenting at the conference at the hotel and my session didn't end until noon, check out time. I ask for a half hour so I could change into travel clothes and was told no but I could purchase 3 hours so clearly, the room didn't need to be cleaned in the half hour between noon and 12:30.

A friend gave me his green points and I was told I couldn't use them at this hotel though I have done the same in SF. He lost the use of the money as, by the time I was told this, it was too late for him to use it. You shouldn't have different policies at diffdernt hotels in the same chain.< /Text>< pictures>

The food experience was as bad as I have experienced anywhere. The shrimp on overpriced shrimp cocktails was soft and soggy and tasted fishy. The chicken, burgers and virtually any meat was way overcooked. Few of the requests made to waiters to adjust or alter food ordered were actually done. "Dressing on the side, no peanut sauce, or whatever" was pretty much ignored. The food selection in the store was pretty weak as well. No fresh fruit or healthy protein bars or shakes.

The tempurature in the main areas of hotel, especially the convention facilities, were below cold and very uncomfortable When asked to warm up the areas no one could figure out how to turn up the temp. Probably held around 60. Froze even with coat on. The rooms were ok but everything except pillows seemed pretty worn out. Not really an experience that justifies payign so much for food and over $160 per night for a room.</Review>

I stay at this hotel regularly (at least 15 times in the past year). The hotel facilities themselves are great : good room size, clean rooms, amenities provided, great club lounge. The location is also wonderful - close to LAX and shuttles provided. The staff here is extremely inconsistent - there are superior staff members such as Brenda, Henry, and Jose that are great at SPG recognition and making your hotel stay wonderful. On the other hand, staff communication here is very inconsistent. I've called in for requests that are never answered, had my stays cut short by the front desk, been billed incorrectly, and am still awaiting make a green choice points to be credited to my account from over a month ago. Overall, this hotel is great for a Sheraton but extremely frustrating customer service with the staff has sometimes made the experience unpleasant. Finally, note that valet service is also very inconsistent - on multiple occasions it has taken over 20 minutes to get my car/car keys have been forgotten so the car was never picked up. On the other hand, most of the valet staff are extremely friendly and provide exceptional service.<//Review>

Its a beautiful hotel but its not a good place for long term guest on a business trip. You hear all the outside noise as well as the other guest. Their is no mini fridge or microwave. If you use the guest laundry, you should consider having your quarters prior to entering the hotel because the staff never has change. The washer doesn't clean your clothes and the drier doesn't dry them. The microwave on the 9th floor was disgustingly filthy the whole time I was a guest. I come to LA every month for two weeks and I thought this would be my hotel of choice but this was not a facility set up for long term guest. If your staying overnight or the weekend its a great hotel for that purpose only.<//text>

Whilst transitting through LA for 12 day-time hours we were able to catch a free regular shuttle to the hotel, book a 'day-room' of a good standard, take a rest , swim & dine.
On exiting LA with a one-night booking, we were able to pay for a late checkout at reasonable cost - (our departing flight was after 10pm). At all times the staff were courteous & co-operative.< /text>

Have stayed at the Westin and Four Points near by quite a few times, not sure why I never consider the Sheraton. Have to say that I was really impressed. The rooms are big and well furnished. Most importantly, the staff were extremely helpful, especially the valets and bell staff. I shall look forward to my next visit.</Review>

<review>STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE...Two laptops were STOLEN from my room! The staff did not bother to help in any way. They refused to take responsibility and treated the situation as nothing happened.

Also, on the second day of our stay, when we got back to our room there was a pair of dirty socks on the bed and floor that did not belong to me!!!

This hotel is well located to the beaches and good shopping areas of LA. It is very comfortable, the beds are great and best of all the hotel is quiet. There is some airport noise bur not enough to be a problem and the internal noise is minimal, no flushing toilets or running pipes. The bathrooms are a bit tired and small and the rooms could do with refrigerators and in room safes. Voucher parking located behind the hotel is convenient. We have stayed at this hotel a number of times and it has always met our expectations.<//Text>

Checked in late afternoon for a one night stay, and was given a choice of an accessible king room or twin room on the Club Floor. Suites were available per the website, but as it was just one night, I didn’t push it. I’ve stayed at this property several times over the years, and it’s a typical airport hotel.

The room is starting to show its age, but it’s clean. Water pressure was extremely low, and the bathroom is rather cramped. The walls are also a bit on the thin side; you can hear the murmurs of your neighbors while they’re talking. The desk has a lamp with built in power ports. However, I wasn’t able to get Internet (either wired or wireless) working.

The Club Lounge is open in the afternoons from 5:30-7pm, and offers cheese, vegetables, soft drinks, and one hot item. Just enough to snack on. Wasn’t there for breakfast, so I can’t comment. The room service menu is varied, and the food is actually quite good. The gym is spacious with lots of equipment, which is good, as it’s usually quite busy.

Not bad for an airport hotel. I’m not sure if I can stay here for an entire week though. But for one or two nights, it’s barely adequate.<//Text>

Hotel room was beautiful and quiet with view of planes taking off and landing. Great pool for sunning. The staff was very helpful.
I recommend to anyone wanting to get away from it all for a few day. No driving required as they provide airport shuttle.<//Review>

<Date>1504854965489</Date><rating>1</rating><text>My brother stayed here for 2 nights and everything was fine except the last night after taking him around the city on May 16 at 7pm ish. I stopped my car right in front of the lobby to drop him off and one of the valet attendants approaching us, i said to him i just dropping my brother off so i came out from the car, opened the trunk and handed the shopping bag to my brother. When i tried to get into the car, the valet guy (Jonathan) was holding the car door so i couldn't close the door and suddenly he slammed it very hard and it hurt my left leg. I opened the window and asked him why he was rude and i said "You work in customer service field, you should be nice to anyone" and he said "Next time do not stop here" and he pointed to an area like 20 ft from the lobby. He looked mad because i didn't not valet my car?? First of all...it's a LOBBY, no sign where to "Drop Off" and secondly there was no other car and i did NOT block or bother anyone around because i just dropped my brother off and it didn't take more than a minute. I called valet manager (Roosevelt Beasley) and left a message to call me back about this case but until now i haven't got any response. I will escalate this case to the corporate and report it to police to file a lawsuit. SHAME ON YOU Sheraton for hiring a very rude ill educated person. I no longer want to recommend this hotel to any friend or family.

PS to manager/supervisor: if you read this...please go and replay the video surveillance around the lobby on May 16 at 7pm - 8pm, I drove black Mercedes and you'll see how he treated me improperly.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>The stay and staff was ok. But the food was very disappointing especially for the high prices. The breakfast buffet was over $20 which would have been fine if the quality was there - it wasn't! We travel allot and in most hotels that we stay in for this price they offer custom made omelets, gluten free, and just an overall higher quality food and selection. We ate other meals there as well and they were OK - but NOTHING was good - it just wasn't terrible.< /text><UserId.>None</UserId.><rate>None</rate>< user_name>

I stayed in a hotel over 140 nights/year the past few years. The majority of nights have been at Starwood properties. This is my favorite places to stay because of the friendly staff the property is well maintained. The gym is one of the best hotel gyms for a hotel this size and the equipment is all in very good condition. The one complaint I have had in the past was with the service provided by the valet and over time the valet service has improved considerably.

I always look forward to talking with Juan in the Club Lounge each morning. He is very friendly and always brings me my morning beverage when I arrive.</text>

I was really excited to find out that I ended up with a corner room but boy was I wrong. At 11:00 PM during the first night, smoke was coming out of the fan and I was wondering if there was a fire, then I realized someone was smoking. When I called guest services, I was asked if I was sure it wasn't weed.

It took me another hour or so to get back to sleep because it took awhile for the smoke to dissipate, then I was woken up before 6 AM by the trash pick up. I was the lucky one who ended up with the crappiest room in the hotel.

The next night, I was woken up by two ladies speaking loudly in the hallway not knowing that there was a room at the end of the hallway. They were nice to apologize when I told them I was trying to go to sleep. Oh yes, I was woken up at 6 AM again by the trash pick up. 

The best part of my visit was getting to speak with Diane and her ability to listen and laugh with me. Although there were comical parts to my experience, I left tired with a headache and additional wrinkles.

In addition to Diane, another part of my visit that I enjoyed was the gym. I should have requested to sleep there instead. Something tells me I might have slept better.</Text>

Second time in the hotel. Staff is very responsive and friendly, room comfort in line with SPG standard, bev & food in the Italian restaurant downstairs better than expected! A very convenient location for flying in/ flying out though you need to expect 1hr+ drive to Beverly Hills/ Hollywood or downtown.<//Text>

We had a group event that needed meals in the afternoon outside of the normal restaurant hours. The food and beverage contact person was completely inhospitable, was aversive, and refused to work with us for what our group needed. The buffet set up for Saturday ran out of food for at least a third of our participants, and the kitchen did not make additional food. The hotel refused to work with us for either (1) the hotel collecting the money, or (2) us collecting the money and paying them after the buffet. They wanted guaranteed money ahead of time, and kept saying that was the policy. They would not work with us in a flexible manner for how our group operates.

This experience was so aversive I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, for any reason. I am reluctant for you to have any more business.

In addition, it was difficult to add more rooms to our block of rooms. People calling in for making reservations kept getting incorrect information, like only king beds available for future dates.< /text>

Operating on overload? Just gotta be close to the airport and get basics taken care of? Need quiet and privacy? No need for entertainment at this time? The Sheraton Gateway will serve you well. Bare bones works on a lean budget.

However, if you care to ask, it will be given unto you. Peace and quiet-thank you soooo much! The front desk staff ordered my down pillow. I got my scrambled eggs from the wait staff (a bit watery but I didn't say *hard* or *dry*, did I?). The cleaning ladies giggled a lot and were lovely about leaving my room alone.

Darn, I like fruit and nuts from the trees in the morning(more digestable)- not melon (afternoon) and pineapple (night time). Dark rye is my fav for bread, but nobody carry's it, do they? I would love brown rice instead of potatoes with my eggs: less of a gut plug. And well toasted English muffins are succinct egg sandwich ends for small eaters: not to be found at the breakfast buffet.

One of the cabbies took me through the *shop-a-holic* parts of town on the last day when I was so claustrophobic I could have screamed. (There is nothing to walk to- nothing in the way of small restaurants or shops). He was a breath of fresh air. That glitz life is not my scene so he took me to lunch in another district- a Iranian restaurant. Ahhhhh. Veggies and small amount of meat. Simple, tasty. THX for the relief! Get out of LA LA land, man. It's a choice. If I come back to LA, I want to experience the Ethiopian district for simple fun and food.

Was informed about the Fitness Facility only when I received a preferred guest card. Wish I had had the option to exercise daily in a district where there was nowhere to walk but in circles. Had little time to check out or benefit from this gym. Got no introduction to the Spa either.

Learned a lot about the hotel business. N-Q for your hospitality.<//Text>

I was stuck at LAX for the night so called to book a room. He gave me a quote that was lower than what I found online but he said he would match it. Put me on hold out of nowhere for a few minutes, came back on and asked if he could help me. Acted as if he had no idea who I was. Was extremely rude and said they were completely booked. Never have been so disappointed with hotel service in my life. Was stuck sleeping in the airport for the night.<//Review>

This is second time my dad and I stayed in LA for our short vacation.

The highlight of the stay: the club lounge and very helpful staff there.

The opportunity: the front desk, especially for the Elite Line. I would call it "Elite Jail", as it was much much slower than the regular check-in line.

Overall, a good stay.<//review>

<time>1444003200000</time><rate>None</rate><text>I just wanted to take the time to point out an exemplary staff member by the name of Diane. I checked into the Gateway Sheraton on Thursday, October 1, 2015 for a Christian Womens' conference that I attend each year. Friday morning when I prepared to shower I noticed the tub and shower weren't cleaned properly. I contacted Guest Services immediately. Diane answered the phone. She was extremely professional, polite and very understanding. She offered to send someone to my room right away to take care of the issue. I advised her that I had shower shoes that I could use for that morning. She said she wanted my stay to be a pleasant one and her number one goal was my satisfaction with my room. I was very pleased with her customer service and professional intuition. I am an SPG member. She offered to give me 2000 SPG points for the inconvenience. She asked me to please call back after I finished getting ready so that she could send someone to my room to clean the tub/shower and service my room. I'm completely satisfied with the exceptional customer service provided to me personally by Diane. Kudos for your great hire! I will return to that location again. Thank you and God bless!< /text>< Pictures>

Beware of room 323!
First the positives of the hotel- very close to LAX, prompt airport shuttle and friendly front desk and Starbucks staff.
After a long 5 hour flight from the east coast, I checked in on 3/29/17 and was given room 323. As I got closer to my room, I noticed a lot of commotion. I was surprised to see that right across from my room was a conference meeting room. There was a buffet food station outside and people were gathered around it and talking obviously. I could hear the chatter even with my door closed. It was a good thing that I had to leave for a tour, because if it was peace and quiet that I needed, I wouldn't have found it then.
After returning from my tour that evening, everyone was gone (thankfully). Later as I slipped into bed, I noticed a grittiness in the sheets. I got out and pulled them back to find cracker/cookie crumbs in the sheets. It was 10 pm at this point and that, along with the fact that I had already unpacked my things, prevented me from requesting another room.
I brushed off the sheets and tried to get to sleep. However, at 11:00 pm I was awakened by the sound of a vacuum cleaner outside of my door that lasted about 15 minutes.  I can only imagine they were cleaning the meeting room space and hallway floor. Then as if this wasn't bad enough, I was awakened again at 5:30 am to the sounds of clinging plates and metal warming pans.  As I checked out that morning, it appears they were getting the food station ready for that day's meeting.  I explained these incidents to the front desk clerk who gave me her apologies. She said that a manager would reach out to me (7 days later - not yet). I have never been to a hotel where the meeting rooms and guest rooms were on the same floor, let alone across from one another. My suggestion to the hotel is to turn that room into a storage space or prep room for the conference area (in addition to making sure the linen is crumb-free). To pay $200 for a room and have kind of stay is ridiculous.  The other rooms may be nice, but not room 323. I don't see myself staying there again.</text>

Very conveniently close to the airport. Shuttle is running every 20 minutes, but is not gigantic.
We had a great stay and it was perfect for our lay over.
Positive:
Close to airport
Renovated room
Big tv
All night room service
A robot will bring you necessary amenities (comb, shower cap)

Negative:
Sound insulation is not perfect. At 4am got a neighbor (think it was below) wake up call. 3 times over 15 minutes
Check in could be improved. Had to wait 15 minutes in queue

Global: would go again. Take a club level room to have snacks and fruits available all night long<//Text>

Overall, a nice property. Close to the highway and airport. Stayed there for work. However, there was one hiccup. There was dried blood stains on the bed sheets and the bedding. Obviously it did not come from me. The hotel staff promptly changed the sheets. Thats all I can ask for. Will stay there again.</Review>

Was given low floor, (4th floor?) room behind elevators and main passage way. Room was for disabled support, and looked like it had not been used that much. No power point available on desk - had to call maintenance, who also fixed the door bolt - he was very good. Shower was for disabled, so I was having to be down on my knees to shower, as there was no higher setting. Also shower rail broke three times and I had to put it back together. Overall not a great stay, and not normal for this hotel. I will be there with my family in Oct so hoping that will be better.

<Review>Stayed here on my way to and from Hawaii. The check in was easy and the room was ready and clean. The hotel is so convenient...just across the street from the airport.

<text>I am an Spg member (10 years+) and had booked a club room .
We checked in and it was as you would expect when you are a number. When we got to our room, keys did not work. We return to the counter for new key cards.pain when you have been on the road for ten hours/or a flight for 12 hours
Our room was clean (as you would expect)
Bath room although clean needed repairs and should not be rented out at the current rate until these are completed.
1/ the clear coat on the top of the sink bench has started to come-away around the sink (badly)
2/ Bath tap would not completly turn off with out really swing on it (which means constent dripping not to mention the waste of water.
Day two of our stay our key cards stopped working, back down stairs where the front desk person was not rude, but was curt, I also tried to arrange a late check out but she would not give me later than 2.pm, although I'm a Spg member. She also would not give me a new key as I had no ID on me.(did have another person there who could ID me, so the duty manager was called. New keys were programed and I was escorted back up to our room, Key's didn't work. I also ask the manager if he would arrange for a later check out the next day (4.00pm ) which he said would not be a problem and because of all the problems with the keys he would arrange for credits on my spg a/c later that day I checked by the front desk see if this had happened NO none of it had been arranged. I did get my late check out but not with out waitting while The front desk person want off to find out and was 3 or 4 min but seemed like 10.
This hotel is clean, close to LAX (very)
Price well
Staff (front desk) if not happy in your job do something you would like to do.
The bath room would not stop me from staying again ( I notifed front desk on checking out)
But the front desk service might

<text>I recently stayed at the Sheraton Gateway LAX Hotel. From the moment I arrived at the property, I felt completely taken care of. The valet waved my sister's car into a parking spot. What appeared to be chaos at first glance, turned out to be a well organized and efficiently run system.

The people at the front desk were very welcoming. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest, and was given a fabulous upgrade. Jonathon Tellez was very professional and courteous. As he checked me in, he gave me several options for my free upgrade. Mustard H Oberoi, the Director of Guest Relations, was very friendly, and offered more hotel services. He made it clear that the Sheraton team (including Rudy) was there to assist me. I am not a VIP, but the team made me feel like one. In addition to complimentary wifi, Jonathon gave us club lounge access. We enjoyed drinks from an espresso machine, and a nice continental breakfast in the morning (delicious fresh fruit, pastries, oatmeal, and/or hard boiled eggs). We were not around for the evening "treats"; however, I am confident they were delicious.

The room was very clean, comfortable, and well appointed. In addition, the bathroom was spotless with no signs of mold. Usually bathrooms and carpets are areas which show a lot of wear and tear, especially at airport locations. This hotel is the exception.

Anca checked me out of our room upon departure. Like the rest of the staff, she was very courteous, efficient, and professional. Within a few minutes, the shuttle bus came, and I arrived at my terminal within minutes.

Airport hotels get a tremendous amount of traffic, and they usually age poorly. One stay may be fine while a subsequent stay might be a mistake. This hotel is the exception. Over the years I've stayed at many Los Angeles properties, but I keep returning to the LAX Sheraton Gateway because of the cleanliness, location, staff, and value.< /text><name>Watravelfun< /name>< userid>

I personally was not a fan of this hotel. It’s very dated on the inside. Rooms are very stuffy. I had fruits flies or whatever hanging around in my shower. Thankfully I was only staying a night so I touched it out. Only pro is that it’s conveniently located near LAZ, I would not recommend this hotel for leisure trips and such.</review>

The hotel is clean and quiet. The staff is helpful. Housekeeping is doing a good job everyday. We have a good place to rest everyday during our vacation. Our flights arrived late in the evening and leave early in the the morning, so the location near LAX is very convenient.</Text>

My mother and I stayed here for one day due to a layover. She flew in from Korea and wanted to get some rest before getting on a plane again so we decided to stay at the Sheraton because it was near the airport. The facilities are clean and nice - your typical "nice" airport hotel. What made me very uncomfortable was the ignorance of the staff. I was born and raised here and speak English without an accent. On TWO occasions, I asked the concierge and the front desk some questions. I started off my conversation in English and ended the conversation in English. During this time, I translated some of the information to my mom. At the end, both times, the staff says thank you to us in Chinese and something else that I did not understand! If you want to say something, say it in the right language. Either train your staff to understand the differences in languages or just stick to English. No one appreciates it.< /text>

Update to owner's reply: Let's be clear that the breakfast offered is not prepared by a chef. Mushy oatmeal, cereal, yogurt, bread, jam, butter, store-bought pastries and underripe fruit only require someone to place them on the table, no cooking necessary (oatmeal being the exception).<//Review>< Pictures>

Everytime I swing thru LAX the Gateway or the 4 points are my two choices. for a couple nights.

This hotel gets kudos for the renovation is looking really good and for the most part a great value. 

Sadly this time the lobby help and front desk manager were simply TERRIBLE. I'm a 173 night going on 200 night Platinum, had my 90 year old dad with me. The manager didn't care one bit or go the extra bit. Lucky for me almost every other manager has served me with a smile. NO seem to be the only thing this manager could say, not even an apology or sorry I can't do, just a NO.<//text>

I stayed overnight after moving from another hotel in LA that was not quite what I was looking for. When I arrived I was greeted so sincerely by the man on the front desk (I believe his name is Rudy) he helped me with my bags, with what to see whilst I was in the area and with airport information.
I was on the club room level, the room was large and beautifully appointed.
I had a wonderful stay and will definitely be back again</text>

<text>Conveniently located near the LAX airport, the Sheraton Gateway was affordable, clean and very nice. The rooms were comfortable and spacious, while the amenities were also outstanding. I liked having Starbucks right downstairs as well as dining both at the bar area as well as the restaurants. The pool area and fitness room were also very nice. The only thing I would say was a little congested, but not at all a big deal for us was the parking. When we arrived, we wanted to self park, but the lot was full which required us to valet. Due to the events one of the days, valet was very busy and congested. Otherwise, our stay was very pleasant and I would recommend this hotel to anyone!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>Great place for our purposes which was to transit LA enroute to Hawaii and returning home. Ideal location, great service and good dining selections. We almost always eat at the bar location in that we arrive late and generally need only a small amount of food to hold us until the next morning. Great Chicken Quesadea.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I showed up, waited in line for check in for 25 minutes, and was then offered a room with only a pull out sofa - not the room I booked. Completely unsatisfactory. They had sold my room out from under me. So, while I'm responsible for paying if I don't show up, Sheraton Gateway isn't responsible for fulfilling their end of the bargain. I ended up not staying, but instead went to the Westin. Oh, one thing, I've got platinum status with SPG. Meaning I spend a lot of money with the company. Doesn't matter here. And the manager wasn't there, leaving the young desk clerk to take the heat. Just bad business, leaving me as a customer that will never be back at this property.<//Review>

Only hitch was wifi, expensive and my wife's company secure login protocols would not connect.
I was at hotel for hand surgery layover and convenience (no larger bounding happy dog, or two playful cats so I got some rest).
and it was better then being at home for comfort. Great airport layover place. Close to Santa Monica, Culver City, Venice etc</Text>< UserId.>

This hotel gets less than perfect reviews on Yelp, mostly due to airplane noise. Hello it's NEXT TO AN AIRPORT. Trust the reviews here. The staff is the best I've ever encountered, even at 5 star resorts. I don't know if they are a special breed or get paid $100k a year, but man are they happy and excited to make your stay the best it can be, no matter if you are in for a week or just a few hours.<//text>

<Review>It was our first time to LAX and we were extremely happy an impressed with the way the Sheraton Hotels front desk staff was very friendly, efficient and knowledgeable of the hotel and area. We were grateful for the way Martha from housekeeping kept our room very clean and tidy every day we were there. We feel Martha should be commended for her hard work ethic to the Sheraton Hotel.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I love the Gateway at LAX for it's location, comfortable beds, and most of all, it's staff, which is excellent.

Orracio in the Paparazzi is just the best. He remembers his clients, and it's why we keep going back! The food served there is very good, and they even have a cheese plate now, which is a great addition. A good GM named Roman, who also remembers everyone. It does not feel like an LAX hotel, they do such a great job.

Greg out at the bar mixes a good cocktail. He's efficient and one does not have to sit around waiting. A definate plus.

The Club Lounge. Hmmmm, now this lounge was known to be one of the best in the US. What on earth happened? It was also one of the reasons I, and many other colleagues would choose the Gateway over another hotel.

There's barely any food there, and at 6.30pm the other night, it was all gone and they did not bring anymore. Really? But they did up the price of that cheap wine one can buy up there. The lounge is one of the Plat benefits, and this has become a sad lounge. What a shame.

They also have a very nice pool area and a nice roomy gym.<//Review>

Checked in on a Thursday with a reservation using points for 2 nights. I was then paying for my third night. The worker who checked us in could not understand this, thus having me come back to recheck in. Actually I had to go to the front desk 4 times as they could not get things correct. It's funny on my last day there, I receive a letter under my door welcoming me with the amenities I would receive for being a Gold Starwood member..a little late .<//Text>

Service is horrible! From the moment we checked in the front desk representative was rude making a smirk as he said; "oh yes, you booked through priceline..." With a fake smile while giving us a look that said more than words. Once in our room I called twice to asks for a baby crib. Then later when I tried reaching guest services again they just wouldn't answer. Employees should be coached better and trained in customer service.</Text>

The first issue I had is that after the first night I had to come to the lobby, check out, and then check back in again because it was too separate reservations. I've never encountered this issue before, every other hotel has always linked the stays and kept me in the same room from check-in. There was also no platinum recognition in regards to upgrade. The hotel itself does the job, close to lax, nice gym, nice pool, decent rooms, but the front desk/and service line aren't exactly the friendliest of people, the cleaners however were always happy to say hi and ask your day was, oh, and the workers in the club lounge were great, too....all in all, a mixed stay.</text></record></dataset><record>

<text>We arranged for my stay to be paid by a company credit card in advance of my stay. This took 6 phone calls and multiple emails and despite being assured on the phone that everything was set, when I arrived the front desk had no idea about the arrangements. Another call from my company cleared this up. We regularly work with hotels, including other Sheratons, that accomplish this in one step. This particular location has never gotten this right and takes away valuable staff time from my company. Additionally when I went to my room there was a maintenance worker in the room fixing the tub. I easily got another room, but it seems that this is something the front desk should have known about before assigning the room in the first place. The actual hotel itself is very nice and comfortable. Your internal procedures, however, need improvement.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

Five times I have called, of which two were with accounting and despite assurance it would be added the last two credits are still not credited.

The service while I was there was your usual hotel service.
My problem with this hotel is the service I received after my stay. I left an item in the room and called several times to try to ask someone if it was found. I was directed to lost and found, who never answered the phone. Tried leaving a message and still a week later have not received a call. I began calling and asking for a manager, which didn’t help either. The phone rang for minutes each time. The last time I called I was given a very long email address to email lost and found. I asked if they could email me the email address so I could make sure it was correct. Of course, I was told no! The operator wouldn’t even the spell the managers name when I asked. I personally won’t be staying here again.<//review>

<review>The hotel rooms are asthetically pleasing but there is a horrible smell eminating from the water. My carpet was soaked upn arrival. There is a smell of sewage coming from bathroom drains. The HVAC system is very loud.< /review>< rating>

Great club room with access to a lounge on the top floor with round the clock amenities. Location is good but parking could be better (either expensive and slow valet, or self parking a significant walk from the hotel). Breakfast was good quality and liked by my daughter.<//review>

At that stage of the evening, with an early flight out, we were not about to pack up our stuff and request a room change (we just threw it away), but the room no longer felt clean. Otherwise it was a nice refurbished room with tasteful appointments. Exceptionally helpful and friendly staff member at check in - all the staff were lovely. Other small details: we would have appreciated a second bathrobe - I would have thought this was standard; if bottled water is prominently displayed with a sign saying "thirsty?" it should also state that it isn't complimentary. The gentleman who brought room service was very friendly and professional - the dessert was only OK. The free wifi did not work (the log in screen failed to load completely). I would have considered this a good hotel (I have always considered Sheraton an excellent brand), but lack of attention to detail and basic cleanliness render it average. With LAX hotels being something of a commodity, this one did not justify it's premium price.</review>< time>

The updates in the hallway and elevators look good. The rooms could use the same update. The matresses could use to be flipped or replaced in a few rooms. The staff is great, rooms are clean. They have installed a pull-up bar since my last stay. Well done ladies and gentlemen< /Review>

We needed a hotel for an overnight stay and the Sheraton was convenient and reasonably priced. The staff were very accommodating and took care of our requests of an early check in, wake up call and refrigerator in the room, even some milk for our breakfast since we needed to leave at 5.30am for an early flight to the east coast. The only downside was the lack of air conditioning in the room which was back to working order late in the afternoon.< /Text>

One of the better airport proximity hotels, I went from my room to my gate in under 15 minutes with a couple of strokes of timing luck, but that was exceptional even with good fortune. Bus driver was great, so was the efficiency of the front desk agent. Not much Platinum recognition, room was ordinary with a very dated bath with poor water pressure and Sheraton Club was very sparse - at 11 p.m. bottled water and a TV were the amenities. Lobby facilities are far too little to handle the number of guests and rooms. Breakfast was perfunctory in the Club Lounge. Location makes this hotel, it can use a number of updates, the lounge was almost comical but overall the hotel was a good price value to be completely fair. It was quiet as well.< /Text>

I stayed at this Sheraton for 6 weeks and was falsely accused of credit card fraud, they said they called the cops, after investigating, they realized that I paid upfront with my own card and they even asked for ID.  They didn't apologize for falsely accusing me.  The manage said, well even though we know you didn't do anything wrong, anytime there's a security issue we have to ask guests to leave.  They literally kicked me out at 2am due to an error on their part and still tried to charge me for that night.

They also lied to me and said that four cops came looking for me, which I knew was a joke or a case of mistaken identity.  The next day, my friend who's a police chief, told me to go down to the precinct as there may be a warrant for my arrest if the police did come looking for me.  So, I did and the cops had no record of a 911 call from them, nor did cops visit the Sheraton hotel at all on that day and that they did not have a warrant for my arrest!! I still don't know why they lied to me!! Are the people at the Sheraton Hotel LAX Racists?  The only thing that changed that week was my hair ( I got braids in my hair) two days before they kicked me out.This is ridiculous!  I would not advise BLACK PEOPLE to stay at this hotel!!</text>

I paid to upgrade to a more spacious, corner room. It was very comfortable and the furnishings were modern and fashionable. The bathroom, however, did not match the quality and attractiveness of the rest of the room. The shower/bathtub in particular looked like it had not been updated since the hotel was built. I've stayed in other rooms at this hotel, and they had the same problem.</Review>

We have stayed here for years, whenever transiting LAX. Always has been a wonderful experience! The corner suites are so comfortable. The colleagues are very attentive, Front Desk, Valet, Shuttle Drivers. Loss prevention team, ( we needed a wheelchair on arrival / departure. Two in room dining experiences, we're not as enjoyable as they should have been on our last stay. Missing items on two separate orders. Solved after waiting for them. We will certainly continue to stay here, and we highly recommend staying here. Anca at the Front Desk is so polished and professional! Perhaps you may want to add "transit LAX" , as primary purpose for the stay. Thank you.</review>

While I like the facilities at this hotel the staff always goes beyond the call to service your needs. I travel a lot and the staff at this hotel is one of the best I have ever had the opportunity to to be associated with. From the banquet staff to the front desk staff to the waiters and waitresses all excellent. Keep up the good work! Steve</Text>

I recently stayed at the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles for a company function. From the free bus service (the drive actually got out of his seat and helped with my bag!!), to checking in at 10am, to the front desk personnel, to the concierge staff, this hotel was absolutely amazing! It handled every single request I had (small and large) with a smile - I will definitely stay here again.<//Review>

For those who need to spend the night close to the airport, in a reasonable price.

Pros: The free shuttle service is from/to the airport is great; Very good complementary coffee.

Cons: The hotel is quite dated- requires serious redecoration; The room is not sound proof- We could hear the noise from arrived flights untill the early morning.</text>

I arrived at 11pm, after a long day of meetings on the East Coast, and the West Coast. I hardly noticed all the room service trays in the hallway as I walked to my room, as my goal was just to get to the room and rest. Arriving in the room to find an insect in the restroom is not what one expects, and may be explained by the overall uncleanliness of the hallways. I returned downstairs to change rooms. I was promptly given a new room, but without being told that the King Bed would now be two single beds. Being tired, I decided not to waste my time going downstairs again. The final point was when I asked why at checkout there was no complimentary water in the room, I was told that the $3 water was complimentary for Platinum Guests. This was fine, and I decided it was just a bad stay, and I would not take this any further, things happen. The only reason I am posting this review is I received a bill this morning for $3 for the "complementary water". I called, and was told to speak with accounting, which just seems ridiculous. I would stay as far away from this hotel as possible. Having spent over 500 nights in starwood group hotels, this one is by far the worst.<//Text>

<user>103038164230715936193</user><text>Very nice room, hotel is nicely updated. We had club floor access for this stay and that was nice.

I would have given five stars but my room did not have a fridge and we had to request one to be brought up. When the gentleman brought it up, he just set it on the floor next to the console instead of putting it inside.  I helped him put it inside and plug it in.  We also went to the club floor for breakfast on Memorial Day around 8:30 and found out they were not staying open later for the holiday. Which was fine, but at 3 minutes to 9, they started taking down everything so that anyone walking in couldn't even grab a Danish or ready-made fruit cup.  This was different from other locations where they've allowed guests to get the already prepared items and they just clean up after 9am.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< date>

There was no substantial difference between the 2 rooms. Additionally, the hallway was dirty with what looked like someone eating peanuts.

We arrived late due to plane delay. The 2am check in was speedy and sympathetic. We were upgraded to Club and given a late check out because not due to fly til midnight.
We had stayed in the hotel for 2 nights the previous month and appreciated again the clean rooms,pleasant staff, shuttle and restaurant..
Will definitely use this hotel again.< /Review>

<review>I have stayed here many times as I travel. I called down to the valet 30 minutes to checkout. When I got downstairs my car was not ready and I could not find the valet for 15 minutes. I finally found him and he expressed he was the only one on duty. He explained that they lost my keys and my car. I was in a hurry to catch my flight and ended up waiting for an hour. The Front Desk Manager was of little to no help. It turns out the keys were there all along and they put the wrong tag on them. I missed my flight, was charged extra money for a new flight, and stil had to pay $32 for valet. Not even 1 apology from the front desk manager. Buyer beware.<//review><username>RH612<//username><pics>None<//pics><rate>None< /rate>< Gmap_id>

<review>Guests should not be charged $20 a night to park at the hotel they're staying in.

Guests should not be charged $20 for a mini-fridge that lesser hotels would have in the room for free.

Room amenities were minimal. Beds, shower, TV, and very little else. Fine if you're staying for one night before flying out of LAX, not as good if you're there for a weekend convention.

Will not stay here again.</review><resp>None<//resp>< user_name>

<Text>J'ai sejourne avec ma femme dans cet hotel dans le cadre de mon travail et j'ai ete tres surpris des le premier jour de ne pas avoir de coffre dans la chambre ce qui parait un minimum dans un Sheraton. La receptionniste m'a propose de mettre mes valeurs dans un cffre a la reception et m'a dit que l'hotel etant vieux il ne disposait pas de coffre dans les chambres (argument un peu léger quand on sait que les coffre se pose dans la penderie sans travaux).
J'avais reserve un package incluant le Valet parking + petit dejeuner et chambre de luxe. Les voituriers mettaient jusqu'a 10mn pour recuperer notre voiture qui etait sur le parking de l'hôtel. La chambre n'avait pas de peignoirs et nous avons demandes un soir des cuillères, nous avons recu des couteaux et fourchettes et a l'heure qu'il est nous attendons toujours les cuillères.
Le personnel dans l'ensemble est tres serviable et agreable mais mettre une enseigne Sheraton meme Gateway sur cet hotel est une blague.< /Text><Rating>None<//Rating><Response>None</Response><username>ChristopherC<//username>< pics>

<Text>I brought my family to LA and booked at the Gateway. We had a memorable stay as a family and, as always, the staff made us feel right at home and were so kind to our young daughter. Although this was my fifth time to be at the hotel this year, it was our first time staying there as a family and they realized why I have told them how comfortable I feel when I am away.
My subsequent business trip two weeks later was another great experience and I look forward to my next visit in the coming weeks.< /Text>< UserId.>

Best gym in area for hotels. Unfortunately, guests feel free to hold conference calls while walking on threadmills and speaking. Hotel needs a no cell phone policy in gym and/or more considerate guests.
Otherwise, hotel has a good location by airport, shuttle from airport, good food, nice staff. Continental breakfast/Starbuck's comes with room.</Review>

Everything about this hotel is quite efficient and attractive: rooms and the Costero Bistro on premises, with one exception: the hotel shuttle.  We were assured the shuttle left every 15-20 minutes. After an hour there was a mad scramble for Lyfts to get to the airport. For a hotel — a good one — that serves LAX, this should not happen.< /Review>

<review>I was undecided on which airport hotel would stay at on my recent trip to LAX. I received an e-mail blast from DL to receive 1000 bonus miles from Sheraton. That sold me, 1000 extra points and the reputable name of Sheraton. Neither the person checking in or checking me out would accept my DL Skymiles number, they only wanted to talk about their SPG. Now I have to work with DL to get the additional miles posted. Time and extra effort that I shouldn't have to do.< /review>< pics>

<rate>None</rate><text>Nice hotel with pretty great staff. Had an issue with the transportation service, though. The shuttle drivers work for another company (they share shuttles with a parking lot), and are not the nicest. The first shuttle driver just drove past all of us and didn't even bother to stop, and we had to wait for another shuttle. So we ended up having to wait over 30 minutes to go less than a mile down the road.

The next morning the shuttle driver was giving a passenger a hard time about which airline he was using. It was obvious the passenger did not speak English, but instead of just looking at the guys boarding pass, he just kept repeating, "which airline, there's more than one". "Which airline"? He would then shake his head in disgust and repeat his question.< /text>< Pics>

However, first two days housekeeping did not pick up used glasses from room and did not leave any replacements as well as no additional bath/hand soap. Had to ask for wash cloths on the third day also. The pillows had no support at all. Staff brought pillows, but they were all the same. Ice machine on my floor was out of order entire four day stay. Also at checkout, staff member neither asked how my stay was or thanked me for staying there. Not usual Sheraton.</text>< Pictures>

Unfortunately, the front desk staff is completely inept. Every time I check in, it takes ~20 minutes for 4-6 staff members to check in less than 10 guests. This trip, we asked for 2 keys, only one of which worked. The next morning, I tried to get the keys re-coded, but I didn't have my driver's license (as I was just leaving the fitness center). The desk clerk said that security would meet me at the room and would give me a key. I even double checked with her to confirm that security would give me new keys. When security met me 10 minutes later, I received no keys and was told that security can't make keys. As a result, it took a third wait in the front desk line to get working room keys.<//review>< pics>

great stay. just what I needed close and close to the Ocean Express bus to the beach. sweet deal. great eating places Manhatton Beach.
the only downside is people smoking at the pickup area of the shuttle but at hotel and folks smoking at the pool and when we were their was a ton of kids screaming and hollering so we didn't get a chance to use it.. weird having pool right outside of the bar area..</text>

<review>We stayed 2 nights & took a city tour. It's close to the Airport, with free wifi, breakfast & shuttle bus services; quiet room with comfortable bedding; lovely food from the Restaurants; front desk staff (especially Juan and Jonathan) offer great service as an SPG member. I also received prompt attention from UK and esp.Singapore Office.
It could do with refurbishment, which will be undertaken soon.< /review><Date>1395187200000</Date>< GmapID>

<review>A lovely, contemporary, union hotel. The spaces are elegant and well maintained.

Located a few hundred feet from the entrance of LAX (Los Angeles International Airport), the eight hundred room hotel provides a free airport pick up service,, 24 hours a day.

The elevators are fast. The facilities, including a pool and exercise room, are well maintained.  There are several restaurents and a bar on the first floor. All are beautifully decorated, with servers, who are knowledgeable and friendly. The meals are well prepared and presented.  Whenever possible, the chef will prepare dishes to your dietary requirements.

We stayed in the Executive Suite. The two rooms have lots of comfortable furniture, a safe, coffee machine, super comfortable king-size bed and a couple of sixty inch televisions.

The modern glass and black steel bathroom, has a large walk-in shower and good lighting. My only complaint: the toilet paper roll is difficult to reach.

This upscale suite includes access to "The Club" on the 15th floor. In the middle of the day the club offers a selection of snacks, an assortment of coffee drinks, teas and soft drinks. In the morning breakfast is served. There is no charge for this comfort.

Alcoholic drinks are available in the bar on the first floor.

The hotel is ADA compliant. Parking is expensive.<//review>< pictures>

This is a solid airport hotel. Much better than most. Good Platinum recognition with an upgrade to a suite of some sort -- really a very big room with a couch and table... very small normal bathroom though.

I used the lobby area to do some work. The lobby area is well setup for people to meet, converse or get some work done. i left my laptop case there and later went down to look for it and it was gone. Called lost and found and luckily it had been found by a hotel employee and was promptly returned to my room!

The reason why I was using the lobby was that the internet in the room was painfully slow, and was very fast in the lobby. I called tech support on the internet and was transferred to the offsite vendor who walked thru a script, including asking me for a contact number -- wouldn't you think that if you had just been transferred to them from the Sheraton Gateway, they would know the phone number to call if they had to call you back -- they did "reboot" the local router and the service did "improve" although it was far too slow, hence heading to the lobby, as I didn't have the time or the patience to talk to someone in a call center, rather than someone in the hotel who might have been more equipped to handle the problem.

Had a breakfast in the Brasserie the next morning. Ordered off the menu. Service was good, but I'd have to say that the food was only just OK!

Anyway, I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again for a quick stay if I needed to around LAX -- would venture further out for a more extended stay.</Text>

We stayed just 1 night so we could catch our flight home the next day. The hotel is very close to LAX with the shuttle bus to Terminal 2 being less than 5 minutes. The shuttle ran regularly with no issues. I had rented a vehicle from Budget for our trip and after dropping the family off at the hotel I returned it and I was able to literally walk the 1 block back to the hotel. The outdoor pool has a fire pit and a few fire lanterns that really added to the environment. Lastly, the hotel obviously has high efficiency noise reducing windows as you seldom and barely heard planes. Only negative was that as a gold member I was not upgraded or even placed on a Starwood Preferred Guest floor. Disappointing though not the end of the world. Overall, good stay for our purposes.< /Text>

I arrived at the hotel late at night and was exhausted. The person that checked me in was so kind. He saw how drained I lokked and offered me a free drink, which I needed. The room was very nice, accept for the dirty towel draped over the showe curtain. It was clearly dirty.</text>

<text>The staff were really friendly and very accommodating.  We requested a rollaway bed and they brought it right away, even though they never told us it would be an additional charge it was worth it.  The wait staff in the restaurant was friendly but didn't seem to know how to accommodate a large crowd.  We also had to pay a small fortune to park for 2 days...way more than what the sign said and we couldn't get out without paying more than double.  That was the main disappointment.  The rooms are nice and very comfortable.  I actually had a great night of sleep while I was there.</text><Time>1436252703543</Time><username>Heather Hurst<//username><Gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</Gmap_id><Resp>None</Resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user>

Their beds and pillows are the best quality that I have ever experienced at a hotel. You get four pillows on your queen size beds. We felt like queens. The food and staff were excellent and the men that parked our car when we arrived at the hotel were excellent too.< /Text>

<Rating>None< /Rating><review>Location: Right by the Century Boulevard. Very close to LAX (about one mile to most of the terminal). The hotel provides a complimentary shuttle, which runs every 15 minutes. However, the shuttle is shared with an airport parking facility by the hotel and I could hardly recognize the shuttle before it ran past me, twice. I ended up walking from Terminal 3 for about 15 minutes to the hotel, not bad at all. The hotel is also close to the famous plane spotting location in-n-out burger, with 15 minutes of walking from the hotel.

Check-in: Professional staff. Although they could not check me in before 3pm, I got to check my luggage with a concierge. My booking is a club-level room, with request facing the runway (to be exact, the south runways 25L/R). They seemed to run out of room of my choice, so the agent proposed a corner room with "city view" and ensure me that I can see the plane landing. I ended up taking the room. It did not disappoint me since the north runways are where most heavy planes take off and land and it was a joy to be able to watch them from my room.

Room: spacious, clean, recently refurbished with a fresh smell of new furnitures. The "city view" is much better that it sounds, with a full view of downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica in distance. Again, you can see planes on final approach to runway 24R and many of them are jumbo jets. Walking out side of the room you can see planes touching down and taking off on 24L/R. The window glass and wall are high quality sound proof, so you would not likely be bothered by heavy jets flying by. The bed is very comfy to me as in most Sheraton hotels I've stayed in. I like the 50 inch TV, definitely bigger than those in many older Sheraton hotels. The internet is not the fastest that I had in SPG properties, but good enough with 5mbps. If your booking does not include Internet, it would cost $12.95 each night.

Club: To get to the club floor and club room, you either book a club-floor room, or you are a SPG platinum member. This club is very spacious, almost twice as large as a traditional Sheraton club lounge. The club has a row of window seats, facing runways 25L/R, perfect for aviation geeks like me. This Sheraton club offers daily breakfast, all-day snacks, coffee, tea, soda and bottle water, plus an evening appetizer. For breakfast, there were hot eggs, pastries and fruits (no potatoes or breakfast meat), with an alternative of congee. For evening appetizers there were no meat either (I've had BBQ chicken wings at other Sheraton clubs). For me, I do not eat a big breakfast and eat a small dinner, nor do I care what to eat. Thus I am OK with the club food, but it would be much nicer if one meat option was provided for breakfast and dinner.</review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d< /GmapID></record>

Horrible service and the charges you see in the end. And then at the reception for every justification you ask this girl Alexia has a response that she doesn’t know. For every thing you ask her she had no answer. We asked the laundry to be boxed half of the clothes were given in the hanger and they would still charge us as a whole! We asked for something from room service they would ask you to wait for 45 mins !!! Absolutely rip off. For the parking they told us 49 usd for the valet and so we decided to do self park then one of the guys from the valet comes and offers a rate of 30 usd. Looks like there is no professionalism and transparency. Anyone is charged anything.
Ridiculous!</Review>

The hotel appears very nice from the outset, but the customer service is among the worst I have ever experienced. The women working the front desk were incredibly rude and were not at all helpful when there was a miscommunication between the booking agency and the hotel. They were annoyed with any questions we had and were not willing to assist in any way. Absolutely would not recommend!</review>

<text>I expected the LAX Sheraton to be a shining example of the Sheraton family of hotels. I was disappointed. Right as I walked into my room it was clear that the bathroom had not been cleaned correctly in some time. The smell of mold was pervasive through out the room. Went down for a drink at the bar and was swarmed by fruit flies due to I assume lack of cleanliness. Then at 3 AM when I woke up to get ready for my departure I had about 2 minutes of lukewarm water before the shower turned cold with the tap turned all the way to hot. 3 AM is not a high demand time for hot water. I am due back in LA next month and I will not be staying at the Sheraton Gateway.<//text>< Pictures>

<user_name>MJ430</user_name><review>My visit was from 4/26-4/30 and was quite disappointing. It was my first time staying at the Sheraton LAX, and will more than likely be my last. The lone bright spot at the Sheraton Gateway LAX was the staff, who helped me out quite a bit. The rest of the experience wasn't what I expected. I had constant issues with wireless internet access on the 12th floor, contacted IT support and didn't get a follow up call for 6 hours, which is unacceptable. The pool and hot tub were closed, and no one notified guests about that until I got a notice in my room the third day of my stay. The rooms were equipped with flimsy plastic cups instead of glasses. I had to be moved to a differente room because of a leaky faucet in a sixth floor room. Major improvements need to be made for me to go back.</review><Time>1336003200000< /Time>< Rating>

Upon packing and checkout we noticed that it was missing and my daughter inquired about it at the front desk and was told that they would check with lost and found. It must have been taken out on May 31st, probably by the maid. I also lost my last days supply of vitamin which I had put in a wrap tissue which I left on a face towel with other toiletries. We checked out early June 1st and when I got home late Saturday and called the hotel and was referred to lost and found but nobody answered the phone. Can you see if you can find this glass. It was a momento from my daughter time spent in Boston.

room was great, good value. Great location. Staff polite.
Shuttle service a problem: first shuttle was standing room only; they would not take us, next shuttle (15 " latter) equally full but packed us like sardines and got us there. Boarding pass printer did not work.< /Text>

WARNING, LOUD JACKHAMMERING GOING ON IN THE HALLWAY ALL DAY. LONG. I COULD BARELY HEAR THE PERSON AT THE CHECK IN DESK. EAR PROTECTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED! The place is crazy-chaotic outside at valet parking, "self" parking isn't even on the premises (though I was told when I called the hotel to book a few days before that it was on the premises!) and still you have to pay for it. Worse still was the shock when entering the lobby: it's almost pitch dark in there! What kind of supposedly upscale hotel chooses to make its lobby look like Purgatory's warehouse? Gray, and gloomy and no luxury feel at all. Plus you have to walk way to the back of the building to get to the "front desk" for check in, which is really two tiny desks that look and feel more like TSA check in counters only less lighted. The walk to the elevators was completely maze-like and then you have to squeeze into this strangely shaped tiny area to get to them to get up to the room levels. Once there, things do not get better. The room was also very dark and gloomy. There were not enough towels provided. No extra blankets. NO REFRIGERATOR! There were two bottles of water placed neatly on the desk for you but watch out because if you're tired and thirsty you might not notice until you open them that you will be charged for them. The bathroom was very tiny and the tub old looking. Oh and a couple of times I tried to call down to room service or front desk and no one ever answered. There were one or two nice staff people and that was about it. Several things I was promised about the hotel and about my reservation turned out not to be true. How do you book a reservation and boldy lie to the client? I just don't get that. Also, shouldn't a business be required to tell you when you are booking in a place that will be having jackhammering going on so that you can opt to book elsewhere?? Really, just not a good hotel *at all*. The only thing it has going for it is that it is close to the airport. Seriously.< /text>

Although the room accommodations and the hotel features are acceptable, the customer service definitely needs improvement. At checkout I spoke to 2 different hotel representatives regarding my charges, and I was specifically concerned about the prepaid portion. I was given a receipt that showed the correct charges. However upon return home I realized that I was charged for an extra day. I contacted the hotel and I was told that the accounting department was closed and that I would need to leave a message or call back tomorrow. This is unacceptable and I am not at all happy with the service.</review>

I cant comment on this hotel too much as it was very much a transit hotel between flights.  The shuttle bus at LAX isnt the easiest one to spot - and we actually missed the first one.  But the bed was comfortable, the room was quiet and the shower powerful - that was all I needed after a flight from China before an internal USA flight.</text>

Receptionist is helpful & professional. Room is clean but a little bit musty smell. I'm impressed by their complimentary water, seldom hotels can do this in US. I am also supprised the free coffee they offered in room is Starbucks, that's so unique. There're free suttle buses run between LAX & hotel every 15 Mins.</Review>

Great location of hotel next to LAX airport for those needing a quick arrival or departure; however, this and other Sheraton's I have stayed seem to need updates/upgrades to their room decor and bathrooms. The bathrooms are poorly lit and the showers slow to drain. I've stayed at 2 different Sheraton's during the last month and both bathrooms smelled like mold. The pink/red mold on the shower curtain was clearly visible so not sure why those aren't replaced regularly by housekeeping. Surely it can be seen and smelled. Other than that, this particular hotel location worked out great for us as the shuttle ride to the airport was less than 5 minutes.< /text>

The LAX Sheraton has to be about the best-run Sheraton in the Starwood chain. From a very nice SPG Gold upgrade from Arlene upon arrival (on a promotional rate) to the excellent service in the Basserie, the LAX Sheraton could give a lesson in service to plenty of other hotels. The facilities are well maintained, the rooms are comfortable, and the staff is first rate!< /Review>

We stayed for a small company meeting. Stay was very good, restaurant/bar were excellent, and their service was excellent. Booking a meeting room prior to arrival took 6 phone calls. After 9 phone calls I have yet to receive my folio and be charged for the stay, meeting room and restaurant charges.</Text>

<Review>This hotel is in a very convenient location for travelers. Easy access to freeways to go Downtown or Santa Monica. I think the club level lounge could be upgraded a little. I know it is just hor d'oeuvres, but the quality and selection at the happy hour could be better.</Review>< resp>

I weighed between Westin and this hotel, and chose this hotel because I found a few reviews mentioning that the meals are great here. I booked a room on the club floor with additional charge because I wanted access to the club lounge to finish some work. However, the hotel was going through a renovation and a temporary lounge was set up in two hotel rooms linked together, the food in the lounge was way below expectation, and I wasn't provided a room on the club floor for some reason. The only thing that I was satisfied with was the staff. Besides the staff, everything else was disappointing. I'd recommend to check whether the renovation is over before you book this hotel.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Great hotel, comfortable rooms, and good service. The main complaint that many have is the expensive parking. $30 for valet, come on. Downtown LA I might understand but not at LAX. The self park is further away and is a private company so you pay separately. Had too much luggage to use the self park.
Golds need to be upgraded more often and respected more.</text>

< review>
I had 2 different reservation confirmations which the hotel refused to merge and required me to come down to the desk to check out and check back in. I found that to be an extreme inconvenience, as I was scheduled to be in a conference all day and did not want to stand in the check in line at the front desk a 2nd time. Had I known that (before my arrival), I would have cancelled the 2nd reservation and extended the stay on the 1st reservation for the 2nd night stay.

Because this simple request was not honored, I began to scrutinize other things during my experience. After encountering the rude associate that checked me into the hotel, I noticed that every other associate was great; however, I did find rust in my room's bathtub and holes in the wallpaper in the room.

I am a Starwood member; however, I was not greeted by name or acknowledged as a member.< /review>

<review>While my room and amenities were good, my experience trying to get to the hotel using their complimentary shuttle has turned me off of this property forever. While the phone recording and website say to expect a shuttle every 10-15 minutes, I had to wait over 30 minutes for one to arrive. About halfway through, I had called the hotel to see if there was a delay or if they knew what was going on. I was first transferred to dispatch where I stayed on hold for a few minutes listening to the recording that all dispatch agents were busy. When I gave up and called back, the operator said to just take a taxi and ask to be reimbursed at the front desk. Mind you, that would require me to leave the shuttle area and wait on the taxi line, but it would be most unfair to the taxi driver who was probably waiting hours for a fare only to come up in the queue and have a $5 ride half a mile away. I expressed my frustration and the unfairness of that proposal to the operator and asked to speak to a manager at which point she said “I can’t deal with you” and hung up on me. This was a totally unacceptable response from someone in customer service. Once I finally got on the shuttle bus, it took another 30 minutes to circle the airport and make its way to the hotel after picking up and dropping off a number of other passengers. I will note that the hotel co-brands its shuttles with a local parking lot. So don’t expect to see the traditional Sheraton branding colors and the logo is somewhat diminished compared to the parking lot. This is a missed opportunity in my book since many of the other hotel chains don’t share their shuttles with off-site parking lots. I explained my experience to the manager on duty and he was apologetic regarding my experience and said it wasn’t the type of service they strive towards. Based on my platinum status I was upgraded to a nice corner suite, which would be nice if I was staying longer than a quick overnight. Overall, I can’t recommend this hotel unless they fix some of their shuttle logistics. The only reason I stayed at this hotel was based on the proximity to the airport and ease of access to a complimentary shuttle. Given the main reason I opted to stay at this hotel was the biggest issue, I doubt I would stay again. I would rather stay at any of the other hotels that had shuttles constantly passing me like the Embassy Suites, Sheraton Four Points, or Hyatt Regency.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Positives

Prompt Shuttle from Airport.
Room looked recently renovated, was clean and in good condition.
Room Service prompt & efficient

Negatives

Poor internal soundproofing - can hear loud discussions from the next room.
Bathroom small & grim.
Platinum recognition non-existence - with a dash of dishonesty from the front desk as well.

Basically gives off the typical airport hotel vibe - they don't care if you come back or not. Which pretty much sums up my feelings.<//review>< Name>

The first night I had what sounded like a child jumping around on the floor above me (I was in 1076). Other nights were fine.

The food service in the lounge continues to deteriorate drastically. It is ridiculous to think that a businessman would not be offered a full meal in a 4 start hotel like the Gateway. My associates and I have taken to finding other places to get a decent meal. The bar staff are as always terrific.<//text>

Check in was smooth, and we were able to check in early. The rooms were comfortable and follow the Sheraton standard. That is what we like about the Sheraton is that you know what you can expect and they don't fail to measure up. My only complaint is that in a hotel of this calibre, can they not use real glassware in the rooms. The plastic cups just don't match the setting. Plus it is more waste.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>The hotel staff, from the front desk personnel, to the business lounge attendees, to the bar/restaurant personnel, perform their duties admirably.
My sore point with this hotel continues to be the menu. Since it has been revamped for Costero, the dining selections for hearty entrees have diminished considerably. I limit the number of times I eat there and have also started staying at other hotels in the area based on the unsatisfactory fare.</Text>< userid>

It is a nice clean hotel. I am diamond on delta and that makes us some sort of status at spg. It is very inconsistent who recognizes that. They went ahead and gave me club access but the key didnt work. The woman at the desk said my delta diamond was not on file (i checked my profile and it is) and made me go back up stairs to get my phone and prove it with my boarding pass. then she told me i needed ID which was also back in the room and wanted me to go back to that. They need to figure this out or it is not worth staying at spgs.< /text>

<text>I have stayed in this hotel twice this year. The reception personnel at checking in needs major training. To me is it not what you say but how you say it that makes the difference. Their attitude is take it or leave it and they lack tact . I booked and paid for a corner suite that included Internet and Breakfast. In the rush of things I overlooked changing my reservation from 1 person to 2 and by the time I checked in I was handed one breakfast voucher. I inquire as to why I was given only one and their response was because I had made the reservation just for one person and if I needed another voucher I would have to pay another $30 Dollars. This was ridiculous because the breakfast buffet was only $22.00. I then said well If I give you back my one voucher then I can get to reduce my stay rate for $30 and the response was sorry I can't do nothing for you. Either pay the extra or beat it. This is the second time things go wrong with this hotel which I am planning on staying away from on my future business travels.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Have stayed @ this hotel regularly when in LA area. Staff greetings are always with a smile. Always treated like I am welcome and expected to return often (which I do). Any complaints or exceptions(few, if any) are handled promptly and with highest urgency. Service is excellant at desk, bar, restaurant, lounge, housekeeping and all with a smile and greeting. This is my chosen location whether business is downtown or near airport due to stellar service.</text>

Friendly staff, nice spacious lobby/seating area. Rooms look relatively new. Meeting spaces are huge and the break out spaces have natural lighting which is a plus. Pool area is a bit small<//review>

- had to change rooms when our room was flooded by the smell of marijuana smoke coming through the bathroom vent - turns out the guy next door was smoking in his room. He got fined, we had to pack up our family and change rooms
- when calling to complain of smoke, the attendant said she'd send up security and then hung up before we could ask for another room - with a newborn and a two year old we were not sticking around - I had to call back to speak to someone else to change rooms
- changing rooms is tough when you're working hard to maintain schedules while traveling, we didn't have 45 minutes of flexibility to change rooms. We also trace with a lot of stuff with two young kids so it's a major production to move once you've gotten settled
- the only person that apologized was the bellman that helped move our bags
- Mac and cheese at dinner for our 2 year old was $12, my wife's order came out wrong - twice
- there were no wash cloths in our new room - making it tough to get our kids cleaned up at bedtime
- we called for a kettle which we needed to boil water for formula - th person answering thee phone was very rude (a bit of a pattern here) - it didn't come, we called back after waiting two hours to follow up
- I had to try three treadmills in the gym before finding one without garbage left in th cup holders

The good:
- parking staff and bell staff were friendly
- the serving staff in the restaurant were very friendly as well
- rooms are pretty nice, just like in the pictures
- noise in the room isn't bad considering proximity to the airport
- Starbucks in the lobby!
- well equipped gym with plenty of treadmills and there equipment</review>< Name>

<review>I have to start quoting one of the reviewers: "This is hard for me because I love Starwood and I love the Sheraton brand (...). I am fortunate to be a Starwood Platinum Member (...), so it is with a heavy heart to have to bring a complaint to the public view". Just some more: I travel a lot - at least once weekly, and I use many hotel brands, mainly across Europe (of course Starwood is my favourite brand). So I have quite a good knowledge what does "good enough" standard mean. And my expectations are not very high - I just want to have a clean and quiet room and friendly (not "intrusive") staff.

I was positively surprised with the special line for SPG Gold and Platinum (it does not happen very often), and that was generally all. The receptionist seemed to be tired, she recited the welcome lines, never asked for the amenity I want to choose. Fact - there were a lot of coming guests and one could be tired, but the next day another receptionist behaved more or less the same way - also having problems to print the invoice with my company details. I have asked for the scales to check my luggage weight - this is airport hotel (bthw. I was surprised that in Sheraton there were no scales in the bathroom). The guy from the concierge seemed not to be happy with my request. Basically I do not need to much warmth - but I would expect something more from Sheraton staff.

And from the airport hotel one would expect better noise insulation - here I can give the example from one of the competitive brands hotel in Zurich, where windows are very vell protecting from plane noise.

I wouldn't be honest not mentioning positives: very clean room, good bed quality, nice lounge, very helpful valet parking staff and convenience in terms of airport distance. So if you need a convenient and price-efficient hotel close to the LAX airport - that might be a good choice.< /review>< Pictures>

While reading many positive reviews of this hotel, it was a pleasure to confirm that this is a perfect airport hotel and the best choice given its proximity and very qualified staff. The Club Lounge is quite nice and added to the comfortable stay.

Thanks for a terrific stay and we will return.<//Review>

<Text>We had flown from Australia and bring totally jet lagged tried to get an early check in. One staff member not very helpful then Coco took over. Her professionalism and friendliness were exceptional I actually think one of the best reception staff we have ever experienced. 
However the new menu in the restaurant was awful. My steak was overdone and when I mentioned how it was terrible I was told it will be noted!! Won't eat there again.</Text>< GmapID>

The staff here is awesome, from the front desk, guest services, restaurant to the valet staff; I have no complaints.

The hotel can improve in a few areas - the noise from neighboring rooms can be excessive and the restaurant prices are on the high side. I have experience very loud neighbors late into the eveing and rowdy guests walking thru the hallways. The walls are very thin and you can hear everything. Possibly a notice to guests to try to courtesy of others and refrain from letting doors slam shut would be helpful.

I ordered dinner ONCE and it was tasty but not worth the huge price.

Overall, I selected this property because the pros clearly outweight the cons, but if the property is looking for an A+ I would invest in soundproofing the walls, moving the beds away from neighboring doors, or at minimum try to house rowdy airport layover travelers away from the business travelers.

<Review>The overall stay of the hotel was good. The valet services or should I say the aparking even for valet is not ample for the guest. Example there were so many cars to park and to get for the valet staff that I on several occasions get my keys and got my car my-self just to leave the hotel. The staff were overwhelmed with the volume of cas to hadle. At 35.00 a day the services and parking need to be supurb.</Review><rate>None</rate><name>Bigtime</name></record>

Great location and offers free shuttle to the Airport,  room had a bad smell and housekeeping are stingy with the amenities, sugger, coffee water and soap.
The free wifi is a joke it only lasts 30 minutes. Front desk could smile a little.< /text>

I chose this hotel because it was close to the airport. The location is very good for that. It is also quite easy to find, since you have to drive everywhere in LA anyway.

The staff were great. My status was recognized and I was upgraded to a mini-suite. I had a great view of the runways and the sunset. The room was quiet and the bed was comfortable. Everything looked recently updtated.

I ate dinner in Paparazzi, with a colleague. It was fabulous!! The wine list was quite good and very reasonably priced. (Although, it would be better if the years were included on the list, instead of having to ask to waiter, who needed to find someone to provide that information.) The dinner itself was wonderful. Definitely more than I expected from an airport hotel.

I will definitely be returning to this hotel, as the restaurant alone places it above all others on the airport strip.</text>

I was given an accessible room (even though I had not requested one, and I'm clearly not in need of one). I checked in around 10pm, and, with a 4:30 wake up call looming, I wanted sleep more than I wanted to go a few rounds with the front desk to get moved.

The other issue I had was with the cleanliness of the bathroom. It looked as if the housekeeper had cleaned it halfway and forgot to finish. There was no shampoo or soap, only a bottle of lotion, and the bath mat was in a wad on the floor.

As a Gold SPG member, I expect more.</Review>< Time>

Maintenance staff responded and released both after their traumatic experience (daughter no longer wants to go in lifts) but there was no apology or recognition by other staff. Even when we mentioned at reception.

The hotel is a great location for LAX. There is a shuttle that comes by to drop you off at the airport as well which is handy. The room was clean and comfortable. My only complaint, which knocked my star rating down to 3/5, is that I asked for a 6am wakeup call and I didn't receive one. The front desk staff who checked me in wrote it down but I guess it didn't get processed. Luckily, I set my own alarm just in case but if I hadn't have done that I would have easily missed my flight in the morning.<//review>

I have stayed in several different hotel establishments as I travel frequently on business. I have never been to a hotel where I had to ask for assistance three times before anything happened, the elevator would not work for every floor, and the bathroom facilities made me feel dirtier when I left than before I went in to freshen up. I understand that this hotel is near LAX, but there needs to be some type of standard so that I don't feel like I'd rather sleep in the airport than at this hotel.</review>

It was amazing to see the first Sheraton at major airport LAX offering the Dim Sum during the breakfast at Club Lounge. It offers two steamed dim sum and Congee with few side dishes with it. Please go there and stay at Club Lounge to enjoy and taste the new items during the breakfast.<//Text>

We stayed here for one night. It's the right price and a good place to stay for a quick layover. The bed and pillows were not comfortable. Pillows too hard/stiff and bed too soft. We did receive an upgrade as SPG members thankfully, as the hotel seemed crowded and that it might have been busy on other levels. We just wanted a good nights sleep for one night and a quiet floor which we received. The receptionist at the front desk was very nice and she is the one who gave us an upgrade without asking.</Review>

If you have a short amount of time in Los Angeles and don’t have time to go downtown, this is the best hotel choice as it’s right next to LAX, is close to the forum, not far from Venice Beach, Santa Monica, Marina Del Ray, etc.< /text>

チェックアウト時には追加精算は不要とのことで、メールで領収証を送ってもらうことを了承したことが災いし、足を踏み入れてもいないレストランの朝食代を請求されることとなりました。
当日中に誤請求をメールで指摘しても返答なし。帰国後にSPGの日本サイトから問合せをしてもレスポンスなし。
誤請求はミスとして許容範囲だが、指摘に対してレスもしないというのは論外< /text>

<Review>I have stayed at this hotel many times over the years....now in late middle age, it's sagging a bit. Housekeeping is superb, the lobby is especially dated, and the soundproofing could get a boost.
The staff aims to please. Shuttle into the airport is especially frequent. Restaurants are within walking distance: a rarity for both LA and an airport hotel.<//Review>< Pictures>

I had booked a room for our wedding night online. When I asked if I could check in early I told them of the wedding. The staff immediately upgraded us to a corner suite, gave us free valet service and had a bottle of champagne with chocolate strawberries delivered to our room all on the house. They also let us check out late at 3:30. Very cool and unexpected.</review>

For the price I was not super impressed. There was no mini fridge and there was a gross odor coming from the sink. The bed was comfy and I didn't hear plane noise at all. BUT the front door was thin and we could hear neighboring doors slamming no problem.< /review>

<review>As usual the room was very nice, clean and comfortable. It seems that the hotel struggles with being consistantly great. I stay at least every other week and some weeks are perfect and some are not close. My last couple of visits were not as good. Standing water in tub on one visit, no folio on checkout and a suprise in the club lounge that the drink prices doubled from one week to the next.<//review><name>starwest</name>< rating>

This property is located in a nice location close to the airport, but feels a little dated. Upon entering the room, the lighting is insufficient and dim. The mandatory valet parking (or optional self parking for a fee across the street) can also be somewhat taxing after a long flight.

The service, on the other hand, is wonderful. Especially Mr. Samuel Li at the front desk who arranged a nice room upgrade for me, as well as found ways to make the long wait for my room less unbearable.< /text>

<text>in fast 50 Jahren und Hunderten von Hotels die schlechteste Hotel-Erfahrung aller Zeiten.

Ich habe am letzten Tag meines Aufenthaltes dem Director of front office operations" und seinen ebenfalls anwesenden Assistenten
Ernesto gebeten, meine Kritikpunkte zu notieren und mir per E-Mail zuzustellen, damit ich erkennen kann, dass die Verantwortlichen ihre Probleme kennen und demzufolge lösen können. Ich habe ihnen bei der Gelegenheit auch klar zum Ausdruck gebracht, dass ich einen Nicht- Erhalt des E-Mail als Nichtverstehen der eigenen Probleme und als Geringschätzung eines Kunden betrachten muss. Leider ist - wie zu erwarten war - kein E-Mail eingetroffen. Ich verzichte an dieser Stelle auf eine detaillierte Auflistung aller Probleme, denn das würde Seiten füllen. Herr O. S. "Manager of..) wird Ihnen bestätigen, dass das erste dieser Probleme war, dass ich - zusammen mit 2 Geschäftsfreunden, die ich eingeladen hatte - am 2. August um 0045h im Hotel meine vorreservierten und bezahlten Zimmer beziehen wollte (wie gewohnt) und die Auskunft erhielt, dass die Zimmer anderweitig vergeben waren und man keine mehr für uns hätte. (Zu Ihrer Info:
Ich hatte meinen SPG-Ambassador bei der Reservation gebeten, dem Hotel mitzuteilen, dass meine Ankunftszeit kurz vor oder kurz nach MItternacht sein könne, je nach Ankunft des Fluges bzw. der Abwicklung der Immigration. Sie hat mir bestätigt, dass dies weitergeleitet wurde und entsprechend von der Hotelreservation gespeichert sei...)

Wollen Sie von der Fortsetzung der Nacht und von anderen, in den folgenden 5 Tagen aufgetreten, teilweise haarsträubenden Problemen hören?
Dann rufen Sie mich an.
Bitte nehmen Sie sich ggf. Zeit, es dauert
eine Weile.
Freundliche Grüsse

I stay here often when on business travel. It is usually always busy however the hotel is very nice and I never have trouble getting to my place of business or the airport. Noise from the hallway or outside is never an issue. The food is good. I will say here anytime I need to travel to LA for business.<//Review>

<Rate>None</Rate><text>I have stayed more than 20 times in this hotel. I really liked it before my last stay. The atmosphere and welcome has radically changed. I am platinum and I usually got a suite upgrade. I totally understand that when the hotel is full of course you cannot have it. At the check in the receptionist told me that "due to renovation" he didn't have any suite available for one night. Then I have checked three times on the website and until 10Pm you could book different suites. I do not like lies. I paid 240USD which is not a cheap price. The espresso machine was broken at the lounge, poor breakfast selection (compare to the other times). There is more SPG option in lax and I will choose another hotel next time that will care more about preferred/repeat guest. Very disappointed and sad.< /text>< pics>

The Sheraton is one of the best within the spg club. Heracio, bartender at the Italian restaurant, which was just excellent by the way, gets the highest rating from us. Kind, helpful with questions about the surrounding areas, catered to our every request, and his service was top notch. He is an asset to your hotel.<//text>

i requested a 4 am wake- up call upon check in. Before retiring i called the wake up service with the one working phone in my room to confirm my 4 am wake up. I also set the tv alarm.
no one called ever!!! nor did the TV turn on.
luckily i awoke spontaneously at 4:10 and made my flight.
so the hotel gets an F on a very basic service<//text>

I stayed there twice during the weeks of Nov 28-Dec 1 and Dec 12-15, both the times it happened and hence thought of writing a review.

Everyday room cleaning service wouldnt replace your soap/shampoo/moisturizing lotion etc and you have to ask for them.

For 3 days I was left to use the same soap (which is considerably smaller).

Why do I have to call the room service every night to get a bath soap. Ridiculous.

Another issue is with the Receipt. I was hoping to reduce the paper waste to ask for an email receipt.

The receipt never arrived, I called the hotel 3 times and their account department never answers the phone or replies to call back... i didnt expect such kind of service from them..</Text>

SPG recognition here is excellent. Everyone made this stay very pleasant. Great attitude everywhere, and that usually comes from Management down, so someone is running this hotel very well.<//review>

I Just flew in from Mexico and checked into the hotel at about 11pm. My flight to Singapore the next day is at 9pm. I asked if I could do a late check out and was offered 1pm.

I clarified saying that I am a gold member and I understand checkout is at 4pm for gold and I was hoping to get a 5pm or 6pm check out.

Was told by the check in staff 4pm check out only for Platinum and Gold members does not have this privilege ? I am confused and will check with the manager tomorrow.

If Gold member is not being recognized in this hotel, then unlikely I will come back</Text>

<Date>1423872000000< /Date><Text>Upon arrival (in the SPG line) it took a little over 15 minutes to check in. Once in my room I went to the club lounge and they literally had NOTHING ( it was about 10:30pm). Upon leaving the club lounge I went back to room to get room service. I called the front desk, room service and guest request line and for 8-10 min of this on all three lines no one answered. I finally get through and order pizza. They told me it would be ready in 30-35 min. It took them 55 minutes and it was literally cold. I called back they brought me a new pizza and it was the wrong kind. I finally just lamented and ate a pizza that I didn't want. By the way it was now 12:30 in the morning. I will not stay here again and suggest that others don't either.....if they can help it.

I wouldn't recommend valet parking, either. They're usually understaffed, take longer than they'll tell you to get your car, and calling down to request the car is a 10 minute process, too.

This is a great get in, get out hotel if you like staying by the airport and just need a place to sleep. If you're looking for a true SPG experience - nice hotels with courteous staff and a feeling of elegance away from home, I'd stay elsewhere. The airport culture really ruins the vibe of this could be great hotel.</Text>< Pics>

<review>The Hotel overall was very good, the only issue is with check in and out. Very slow in this area, at one stage when we checked in there was 2 staff for about 12 individuel people waiting to be checked in and I did not find them very pleasant and they did not to look at people when dealing with them. They could maybe smile as well. But overall location and standard was good and pick up and drop off very good and quick.</review><user_id>None< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

This Thanksgiving I needed a hotel for my wife and two daughters because they were dropping off a college friend at LAX. They arrived late, around 10:00PM. Upon arrival the valet did a great job taking care of the car and giving me a piece of mind. The club floor room was great and the location perfect.</text>

I usually stay at the 4 Points Westside. They were sold out so I chose the Sheraton as their self parking was less cost than the nearby Westin. There should be a disclaimer on the hotel site stating that self parking is 1 block away in a public airport long term parking lot. Most of the open spaces are a long long way from the hotel. Plus guests are required to walk a block down a dark street to reach the front of the hotel. I did not feel safe and would not let my daughter park in the lot by herself. Absolutely no security. The in and out pass given by the hotel worked once, then it didn't work anymore. I had to pay to get out. The hotel took the amount off my charges, but it was annoying. When I brought the car around to check out the valet told me if I didn't come back in 15 minutes, they would charge me for valet. After all this, I had a few choice words for the valet. Self parking is $18.00. Valet is $33.00. Total rip off.
At check in, I was told that an upgrade to Club Level was $30.00 even though I am SPG Gold.
The room was clean although there was no free bottled water. The internet was faster than many hotels. The staff didn't seem to care much if I was happy or not.
There are plenty of other choices on this part of town. I would not return to the Sheraton Gateway. If someone doesn't mind paying $33.00 for valet parking or dealing with a staff that doesn't seem to care, then by all means stay here.</Text>

5 elevators, and still a 20 min wait. No bottle opener, corkscrew, or cutlery. Pillows were Devine. Valet service on the run. Good just a little too deep dried for my liking.< /text>

Stayed here in November before a trip from LAX to China. Location to the airport was a prime factor (and it is close) but parking and ease of access is difficult. Since we had a late night flight we decided to keep the room the next day so we could do some sightseeing before we left, then freshen up before the flight. Hotel agreed to this for a modified room charge. The night we were to leave the hotel was very busy with private parties; after we went to dinner hotel wouldn't let us park our car for 15 minutes to get our bags without a $6+ fee, then they tried to charge us twice for the extended room stay. We got the room charge straightened out, but it was a hassle. Additionally, hotel does not have, or did not have available when we were there, a cafe type restaurant where we could get a quick, moderately priced meal. The surrounding neighhborhood is also seemingly devoid of such places. Front desk was no help in this regard.< /text>

This used to be my hotel of choice when travelling thru L.A.. Over the last few weeks I have noticed a decline in quality of service and care. After my last stay, I decided to consider other hotel options for my next trip.
Upon arrival and check-in, the front desk staff seemed hurried and overworked. Rather than the friendly welcome that I used to recieve the check in was rushed and impersonal, even though there was no line waiting behind me.I am guessing that this quick process contributed to not receiving the wake-up call that I had requested. I have also noticed that my long standing Gold status no longer gets me the upper level room or extra amenities that it used to. Nothing major, but it was the attention to personal detail that used to keep me coming back.
That said, the staff in the Paparazzi Lounge continue to exceed all expectations in professionalism and service. The experience at Paparazzi remains the primary reason to stay at the Sheraton LAX Gateway. Be sure to stop in and tell them that Steve said "Hello".< /Review>

I was parked at the airport parking lot next door, but Google Maps thinks I was actually in this hotel. So if I say that I do not have anything negative to report, would that be a legitimate posting? Since I don't have anything to report anyways?</text>

<text>I was not able to have breakfast in the Club Lounge last week as I normally do every day because of how crowded it was every morning. Someone decided to cut the overall eating area in half and remove the tables from the west end of the lounge. This effectively crunches nearly all of the guests into half the room. Poor design/decision. I hope others will complain and this unfortunate situation will be corrected.< /text>< Pictures>

This hotel is well located, but service was mixed in guest attentiveness. While room was clean with good FF&E and generally comfortable, bathroom counter had peeling finish. Also TV was smaller than generally found elsewhere. Concierge lounge was heavily used and poorly staffed given the level of patronage. Offering was ordinary. Restaurant food ordinary and overpriced.</text>

This hotel is average at best. The staff is very nice, but the rooms are tired, the mattress in my room was sagging - the ac very hard to regulate the temperature in the room.
Bathrooms are small - the door opens into the toilet - towels have definitely lost their fluff -
tv channels sometimes cut in and out so you could not watch a program without interruption.
for location and a quick in and out into LA is is ok - no recognition of gold status, granted I have not stayed at many spg hotels this year, but still it would have been nice to hear 'thanks for being a gold'</Review>

The hotel is very near LAX and if you don't have too much luggage, consider walking to the hotel. The shuttle did not drop me off at the main entrance. The first room they gave me was not prepared and I had to return to front desk to get another room--all of this was around 1:15am and I was very tired after a long flight. They did offer comp services though for the inconvenience which was nice.</text>

The hotel is really good. Location is perfect. Only issue is the access to food as there aren't many options within walking distance. Ate at Paparazzi, which was recommended by the person at the check in desk--no surprise. Problem is food is way overcooked. My seafood appetizer and the halibut and the risotto were cooked at least 5 mins too long and were dry and chewy.<//Review>

My sister ate at the restaurant and ordered the beyond burger (a vegan meat substitute) and they gave her a real meat burger and she ate it and didn’t find out till after. This is the worst mess up you could make. Horrible service and we are really disappointed with the kitchen/wait staff. We will be taking with hotel management.< /text>

<review>I wasn't greeted as a SPG customer and the room I was given smelled like it wasn't very clean. We were kindly and quickly moved to a new room but then the tv didn't work so we had to call for service to help with that. It had been unplugged. The first 2 nights reservation were made with SPG points and the third I paid for. I had to go down on the 3rd day to check out and check in again which was a bit of an inconvenience. Overall the room was okay but not what I expected of a Sheraton. Would not recommend this hotel.<//review>< Pics>

<text>I stayed at this location twice, before and after a trip to the Dominican Republic. This hotel is a standout. At the beginning of the trip, once I had gotten thru security @LAX, at 5:30 am, I realized I had left a laptop computer in the room. In a panic, I called the hotel, explained my predicament, and was connected right away to the bellhop who had assisted me earlier that morning. Mr. Williamson checked my room, and sure enough found the laptop on the bed. I hopped back on the airport shuttle bus, went back to the Gateway, where Mr. Jorge (sorry I didn't get your last name) was waiting for me at the concierge desk with the laptop. I immediately hopped on to the same shuttle and got back in time to catch my flight to Miami. What a great staff!< /text><resp>None</resp>< Name>

I have been staying here for many years and have never been disappointed. It's pretty much what you would expect from a full service Airport Hotel.</review>

This is an average hotel pretending to be a nice one. The "buffet breakfast" is horrible (even when it was free with our status. Whatever you do, do NOT order a latte from the restaurant, it's from a machine, in a tiny cup and ridiculously priced at $5.40. Also took over an hour (and three phone calls) to get the baby crib we requested before checking in.</text>

< Review>
Upon entering the facility I was very impressed with out open and updated the lobby area was for a hotel so close to LAX. Rob at check-in was absolutely fantastic and did everything he could to ensure I received an upgraded room.

Overall I was quite impressed with the service of most staff and quality of the hotel, but was extremely disappointed in the valet and room service.

As requested at check-in, I called down 15 minutes ahead each time I needed to take my car out, only to wait an addition 5-10 each time. Once my keys were misplaced and the other two the valet staff informed me that the front desk never called them about my car and that it was a frequent occurrence. For a hotel so closely located to LAX where people are coming in and out and generally in a rush, you'd think they would have this system down. I realize that they're busy down there, but absolutely ridiculous that there was no sense of prioritization upon realizing they they had made a mistake.

I ordered room service one night with a 45 minute delivery which was expected. What wasn't expected was that several of the food items I had ordered were not fulfilled. I was informed that I'd have to wait another 30-45 minutes in order for them to complete the order (would have been after 10:30 PM) and ended up just snacking on what was delivered and leaving the facility (forced to use the slow valet) and finding a meal elsewhere.

Would absolutely stay again due to its proximity to LAX and being one of the nicer SPG properties around the airport, but would likely not valet (or expect a 20 minute wait) and definitely no room service.</Review>

Wonderful hotel. Clean rooms, trendy but not in an overwhelming/offputting way, friendly/well-trained staff, good airport location with cool views if you like that (yet very quiet in the halls and outside the windows), free airport transportation, good food.

When we arrived, were greeted warmly and friendly. Everything was good, size of room to amenities, everyone was very friendly and couldn't do more, we only stayed one night, heading to Hawaii the next day. Only neg was cost of food at the restaurants , extremely high, but maybe because this is LA, would stay there again.<//Text>

I was staying at this hotel on Nov 30 - Dec 2 for the Frequent Traveler University. On Saturday morning, there was a broken pipe outside the hotel so the hotel had no running water for 6+ hours. The management and GM were very honest and explained that they were working on problem and had it finished before Saturday night. The whole staff and bar tenders were all very friendly and professional. I loved the view outside my hotel of the LAX runway.<//review>

<Text>I stay at this property many times a year. Conveniently located to LAX and to freeway! Great staff who often remember me and my preferences! Great SPG lounge!

But ... being awoken at 6:40 am to someone steam-cleaning the hall carpet right outside my door ... NOT good and NOT appreciated!

It's the only time it's ever happened, but that's not acceptable at any hotel.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Very close and convenient proximity to LAX airport, including a free shuttle running every 15 minutes. Not much by way of walkable businesses nearby. There are a handful of eateries of varying quality within 2/3rds of a mile, but not really a bustling business district. But for a quick stopover to rest up during our 9 hour layover it was a perfect solution. Longer stays would probably want a vehicle or an account with a ride share service.

Our room was clean. The on site dining was decent faire. There is a Starbucks on site too. While we were there the elevators were always in high demand. I don't know if one or two were out of service or if it's always this way. But we were always able to squeeze in, though a couple times we witnessed others opting to wait for the next one.

There is a small amount of airplane noise, but not objectionable, particularly given the convenience in proximity to the airport. Mostly the sound registered on my mind first as "are those airplanes?" ...and later not noticeable.

If I had another long layover after an international flight and wanted to get some rest I would stay here again without hesitation. If I were a tourist spending time in LA I wouldn't consider proximity to LAX reason enough to forego staying closer to interesting parts of the city (which this is not). If I were in town just on business and my meetings were close by, sure, this place would fit that need well too. The hotel is great, clean, well run, well decorated, and everything you would expect of a big brand hotel in a large city.

For my use case it was also ideal, and I suppose the next time I have a 12 hour flight followed by another couple hours of flying, if I'm unable to get the flights close enough together I will intentionally book them far enough apart that I can do a stop-over here to sleep off some of the jetlag. I was able to arrive home in much better shape than if I had pushed through without rest.<//Text>

  Very disgusting.Then after that I found a bug in the bed witch it wasn’t the one I was laying in it was a extra bed that I had and when I brought it to stuff attention they said they couldn’t do anything about it because the hotel was fully booked witch I know it really wasn’t.The staff attitude was very sad considering the fact that my family only book with the Marriott.I wish things could’ve been different because I love you guys but i  was treated so bad.<//Review>< Rating>

<Review>I am a diabetic and requested a refrigerator in my room, when I made my reservation. I was told I would have one. When I registered, I was told that I had one in my room. I got to my room, no refrigerator! I called down and was told one would be brought right up. I went to dinner and came back, no refrigerator!! I called again and the person on the phone said one would be brought up. I explained that I was previously told that and the man put me through to the manager right away, without even discussing it with me. I know why the manager was an outrageous man.
He told me that refrigerators were on a first come first serve basis and that they were out. I asked him what hotel he was going to purchase a room for me, or was he going to move me to a luxury sweet with a refrigerator? He then started back peddling and said that he would go to housekeeping and look. He said he would call me back in a few minutes. 30 minutes later, I finally called him back and he told me that one was coming.
I explained that no one until him had said that a refrigerator was a first come first serve item and that medical necessity played no part in the process. This was 10:30 pm and with the frustration, I could not get to sleep until 11:30 - way to late.
The next morning, I discovered that I had been charged for the refrigerator (which has never happened in any hotel after explaining my medical need.) I went to the front desk where I was assisted by a very nice young man named Paul. He immediately reversed the charge and gave me some starwood points. He also told me that the hotel policy was that if they could not get a refrigerator, that a bell hop would be sent up and that they could store the medicine in a refrigerator down stairs. (Why hadn't the manager the night before told me that?) Paul also put me in touch with the manager, Mary. When I told her the story, she confirmed the policy that Paul had told me, and said that they never charged for refrigerators on medical necessity.
All in all, the manager soured my taste for your hotel. I would appreciate a response to this. During the entire process, he never apologized for my inconvenience.

The next night I had another problem.

Your staff alwaysed corrected my problems, but I still had problems.

Thanks,

Doug</Review>< Pictures>

The room, staff, amenities were fine, I stayed one night prior to flying to the east coast. My biggest disappointment was the shower/tub. We had to stand in ankle deep water to shower, the drain was very slow. It was late and I didn't want the hassle of someone coming to the room late so I mentioned it upon checkout. Also there was a light out near the door. The room itself met expectations.</Review>

<Text>I waited one hour for the shuttle. I, as well as other guests were angry at the indifference of the shuttle driver. He passed us by on a few occasions and was apparently laughing at us. I hope he gets fired. I finally made it to the hotel and it took 45 minutes to get my car, even though this was 2 am and there was little activity at the hotel. To think I have chosen this hotel in the past for it's convenience! Please get your act together!< /Text>< UserId.>

Upon entering my room, the bathroom soap was already used. 

When I went to use the phone, the red message light was on so I called to retrieve message so light would turn off. There were no messages so I called the operator only to find out there was a phone "upgrade" and some phone lights will never turn off. My phone was one of them. 

To top it off, someone proceeded to unlock my door and walk in 20 min after I did. The front desk had checked him into my room by mistake. As a woman traveling alone, that's a real life nightmare. 

Man went downstairs to get a unoccupied room and I called front desk. I was offered 7,000 points for my trouble. When I checked out two days later, I asked about points and they had no record of that. Luckily the person who checked me out was a woman, sympathized with my situation, and gave me the points that were promised. 

I will never stay at this property again.< /Review>

<name>Smith Leong</name><Text>this hotel earned their 2 star rating thanks to their location and spacious room. Else it would have been a big fat zero. My room does not have a "do not disturb" sign. After calling multiple times to get one and getting it wrong, they finally managed to get me one which they soon remove it and come into my room and clean it up while i was away. When i questioned the front desk, not only was the guy unapologetic, he simply put it that there's "A CHANCE" that the other guest took it away this the room service team went into the room. I was too lazy to argue. Agree to disagree, but guess what? 2 days later they came into my room again despite specific instruction to NOT come in!!! To top it up, their room service provides very lousy food and they have one of the worst in room internet ever. Avoid at all cost unless u love house keeping, eating lousy food and do not need internet cause u still writes letter and send it out with a pigeon.</Text>< gmapID>

Great staff and service. Our room which faced Century Blvd was noisy due to planes taking off, noisier than we recalled from our past stays. Maybe the winds or weather had something to do with the louder aircraft noise. Front desk moved us to a quieter room which helped. Management said that the upcoming renovation will improve the sound proofing for those rooms. Otherwise loved the pool, exercise room, and club lounge. We prefer this hotel over other Starwood properties on the west side of Los Angeles.</Review>

The reason I'm a SPG member is the consistency, you know what your going to get. Like umpires you don't notice him until he screws up a call or has a inconstant strike zone.

The Sheraton Gateway is that consistent umpire.<//Text>

Our first room smelled like someone smoked out. Called the front desk and the guy was rude about it. My husband talked to the front desk and we got moved to another room. The overall cleanliness was meh. The toilet in our new room looked like it wasn't cleaned with urine stains all over. For being a Sheraton hotel it was disappointing.< /review>

The staff was very helpful and pleasant. I was concerned about noise in the airport area, but that was not an issue. Even in a suite however the next door rooms on both sides could be clearly heard in conversation. I wish they had real glassware, but they did bring us some to use instead of plastic when we asked. Minimal electric outlets were the only other issue. The room was a nice size and the view was pleasant, the furnishings were fine also. We found it a convenient drive to various parts of town.< /Review>

I enjoyed my stay there however when I checked my bank account. I was not aware of a $75 hold. Nothing was said when I checked in nor when I checked out. I called to ask what was I paying for and she responded saying it was a hold and would be back on your card in 72 hours. Well here it is Tuesday and I checked out Saturday morning and I still don't have my money back into my account. Other than not being informed of a $75 hold the stay was great.<//review>

There are so many other Hotels you can choose from, so don't choose this one. No free parking, Valet is 50$ or parking a block away and walking with your bags is $40. No free wi-fi. Pay 15$ per day for wifi. No visitors parking. They will have to pay about 3$ every 15min. I got my room for 110. In total the hotel stay was 170 + 70 dollar deposit. Stay in another hotel.< /Review>

The room was wonderful.  We were disappointed there wasn't a fridge in the room,  but understand most fly-away folks wouldn't need one. We were hoping to use the pool after dinner, but there was a party happening and we weren't comfortable bringing our kids down to play in the water in the middle of a party.<//text>

<review>Didn't have the room initially that I reserved. Finally gave us one which was for handicap. Stain on bed. Empty lotion bottle on floor.  Room service ordered and partly incorrect. They don't refill your Soap and shampoo unless you call, even if it is empty.  Will use other hotels next time. The lady at check out asked how our stay was and i said it was OK, not great. She replied ok and didn't ask why. Hope this helps.<//review>< Rate>

The fairly recent renovation of the valet/free airport shuttle stop, and lobby make this an even better place to stay. The star of the show is one of the managers, Jonathan. For many years, he has gone out of his way to make sure that we have nothing short of a perfect stay.< /Review>

I mentioned this to them in person and via survey 2 years ago. There guestrooms have shower floors that are dangerously slippery. They have no texture, there are no safety bars and there are no anti-slip mats. I dreaded taking showers and desperately clung to the metal door frame to keep from falling. It's a ridiculous situation. I wonder how many people have slipped, fallen and been severely injured.< /Review>< response>

I was a little disheartened to find the sprinkler head in the bathroom was corroded and painted, thus creating a fire hazard situation. The HVAC vent didn't work in the bathroom. The bed had a sinkhole on the left side. All in all, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, it was just the above mentioned items that made what's normally a wonderful stay, less than par.I was told the hotel was going to undergo renovation starting this week, so I hope the sprinkler heads will be inspected and replaced as necessary.</review>

I don't typically comment on hotel stays, but the cost to me and my company did not match the quality of the room. It was over-priced by about $200 per night.

The staff was quite lovely.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Just acceptable. One of the pillows on my bed was not down and was really lumpy. Had a connecting door despite requesting a room without it. Key card automatically stopped working at 12 noon despite having late check-out. Room service was well below par.< /review>

The reason we chose this hotel was because we had planned to meet with a group at the pool, it was closed the entire stay. Staff gave us no reason for the closure. Asked for a call from the manager and we never recieved one. The room was dirty and over looked an alley. The only thing we enjoyed was the workout room. Not used to such poor treatment as a SPG guest...</text>

<review>The hotel DOES NOT FREE WIFI, how can the Sheraton claim to be 4 stars but not have free wifi? My friend got the deal on this through Hotwire and we felt jipped that it said "free wifi" only to find out that it does NOT. The hotel is close to the airport but any decent food, shopping or things to do are quite far and require a car. The rooms are clean, nothing special about it though.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1541003071021, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback, Lani.

<text>I stay here often and I do like the hotel. Staff is very good and helpful. The one downside is that the condition of the hotel is deteriorating. I often of late find problems with the rooms...with 24 nights spent here in the last 6 months, I have been in alot of rooms. Need to improve awareness of properly working room features...otherwise I find the hotel very convenient and definitely recommend. One slight observation is that they do treat plantinum members well, although I slipped to gold this year and I definitely feel the difference!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>3个月前入住过，因为感觉不错就带领了10位家人和朋友再次入住了，大家觉得都不错。正逢中国农历春节入住，浓浓的节日气氛让人感觉耳目一新，颇为感动，可见酒店在迎接中国游客方面下了一番功夫，是远道而来的中国游客一下子没有了距离感。
特别值得称赞的是shuttle bus 司机主动帮大家提行李，information desk 耐心解答都非常有专业和敬业精神，值得讚赏！</Review>< rate>

<username>GQ00< /username><Review>Our family spent our thanksgiving vacation in California and stayed in different Starwood properties, and the stay at the Sheraton LAX was unpleasant. The staff at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel was unresponsive and rude. Upon arrival, the check-in staff impolitely asked me, "last name" without any greetings. During the 15 minute check-in process, the staff would not give any advice about staying at this hotel such as the airport shuttle service, and did not mention any of the benefits of a Club Room, and no smiles whatsoever. The staff even asked us to provide more documents than we should.

Normally I do not like to write any negative reviews (and reviews in general), but apparently the check-in staff at this hotel was tired of talking to hotel guests, and was not satisfied with the job. The property has great features but the customer service needs improvement.< /Review><Rating>None< /Rating>< gmapID>

I took the shuttle from the airport which as stated in the phone was only about a 15 minute wait. Upon arrival I was told that my reservation (through Priceline) had been cancelled because the card on file had expired - I got no notification from Priceline whatsoever. I was able to redo my reservation with Sharaton pn the spot but was told I'd have to pay $75 on top of the original price. The next morning after checking, I got an invoice from Sheraton and all I had been charged for was the original Priceline amount. I am very appreciative of this! The rooms were nice - bed was super cozy! And the towels were very soft. Despite being close to the airport, the sound of planes was pretty limited. I did have a room that was adjoines to another, which was a little nervracy. The lock was on my side, so it was fine. The walls within the hotel seemed pretty thin because in the morning I could hear people in the hallway talking, someone knocking on neighborimg doors, and at one point the person in the adjoining room throwing up. Having a Starbucks so close (in the lobby) was really great in the morning. Overall l, my experience with this hotel was very lovely.</text>

The hotel has some real strengths but also some areas which need improvement. It seems that this particular hotel is an older hotel and there had been some revamp done in the past. The lobby is nice and has Wi-Fi capability (although it was hard to connect to it at times). Restaurants are adequate and there is a Starbucks and a hotel store on premises. Starbucks prices seems higher than prices at a regular storefront Starbucks and the prices at the hotel store are truly eye-popping. The personnel/staff are very attentive and professional - one of the hotel's strengths. With regards to the rooms, I've booked a traditional King twice so far and notice that the actual main room is all right but it's strange that there is not a room safe to lock away your valuables - you have to bring them down to the front desk to store. Alot of hotels have this simple feature. The room also does not have a fridge which is inconvenient if you want to store and chill water and drinks. The ironing board was truly old and stained. The bathroom appears not to be renovated and is quite old. I had a low pressure toilet issue on my second trip and while maintenance tried to fix it, I was always a little worried about the plumbing. Didn't have the same issue during my first trip but did notice mold on the ceiling at that time. They really need to revamp the bathrooms. The hotel also does not go out of their way to let you know about two really good features - (1.) There is an Ocean Express bus that will take you from a stop near the hotel to Manhattan Beach and some shopping malls and back again for a $5 round trip ticket; and (2.) according to a card in a drawer by the bed, you can get a $5 gift food certificate for use in any restaurant/coffeeshop at the hotel if you choose not to get your linens and towels changed (have to hang a special notice on the doorknob before 2am the night before). Also, you can print out for free your airline ticket at a public computer and printer in the lobby but it's a bit hidden and near the hallway towards the gym. One of the best features of the hotel is their gym. Alot of good equipment. Free shuttlebus to the airport is a great feature.</Text>

When you have to just rest and get away from the craziness of airports, delays, travel nightmares...the Sheraton Gateway LAX is the gateway to rest. The staff is super friendly and I found them bending over backward to make sure I was comfortable and had all my needs met. I was exhausted, beat and feeling low but this place was a sanctuary for me from the tempest that raged outside. All I needed was a quick respite and this hotel was more than accomodating to that need. I will remember this sunny island next time I fly by, most certainly.</Review>

We needed a hotel for to go to for our 12 hour layover at LAX and this was perfect. Our flight arrived in at 6:30 a.m. And by the time we got to the hotel we were extremely lucky our room was ready. Everyone was extremely helpful and nice< /text>

<user_id>None< /user_id><text>I booked my stay for a conference at the hotel two weeks in advance. I asked the booking rep if there is a refrigerator in the room, she said "yes, every room has a refrigerator in it, I will also put your request in the notes so you can be sure to have a refrigerator in your room.
On the day I arrived, as I was driving I called and asked the hotel front desk about my parking options as I forgot to ask at the time of booking. I was told the valet prices versus the lot behind the building. So as I pulled up to the hotel I asked the valet how far of a walk it was from the cheaper lot. They said "oh it's very far and you have to cross the street" so I parked valet. (Just to find out that the next driveway 50 feet away on the same side & same block is the cheaper lot.) WOW!
After check in I find out that not only do I not have a refrigerator, but it's also $20 extra. I got on a waiting list and didn't get one during my whole 3 night stay despite asking often.
Another issue was housekeeping. My first room was not properly cleaned. The tub had a hair on the edge as well as the soap dish had a hair but not from one's head, both from previous guests. The bathroom mirror frame had splatters that looked like toothpaste and paint. Remote control had a thick layer of dirt & dust across one row of buttons. I asked to switch rooms. Had to wait a while for that because they would rather clean than switch you over.
My second room had a bunch of dirt splatters on the bathroom light switch as well as a brown stain on the white bed skirt. I didn't even bother to complain about the second room.
My room keys stopped working and I had to reset them. As I was checking out I had a room charge of $6 for two water bottles in room that I didn't touch.
Over all I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a peaceful, pleasant stay.<//text><Rate>None< /Rate><Time>1365984000000</Time><Gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d<//Gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures>< user_name>

stuck in LAX for a day, i was happily surprised to enjoy a nice, fairly premium experience at the sheraton gateway. details are nicely executed, staff pleasant, abundance of lobby space/meeting space, good sized fitness room and pleasant enough pool area. my only below average mark goes to the bathroom. the shower/bath was old, pressure weak, and shower not properly working. otherwise, all around As.< /Text>

Always an excuse, need for apology,  slow response times from management,  getting an answer to an in house call to front desk almost impossible,  love the location,  but the entire staff could use customer service training. There are a few staff members who are excellent at their jobs, but very few.<//Text>

The staff were friendly. Liked that the hotel was situated between airport and beaches. The pool area had a fire pit for the cooler evenings and comfy chairs to lounge in. The downside - people left too much garbage in the hallways on the floor we stayed on. There was also the constant loud slamming of doors.<//Review>

However, on the second night, they have a large party in the room next to me and I call down at midnight and they say they will send up secuirity and I call back at 2:30AM and tell them it is still going on and very loud. So, ok, I don't get much sleep, so when I check out the next morning the nice gal says she is sorry is says she will apply 10,000 points to my account.

<text>This place leaves a lot to be desired. Seems to have very poor management.  Would reccomend them work on communicating between staff members. Called ahead for a simple request of allowing someone to check in before I arrived, for some reason there was confusion regarding this once I arrived. Long story short, the two days there and interaction with the staff clearly showed me they are not one of the better Sheratons.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>I am a longtime SPG platinum member. I rarely write compliments into a website, but I wanted to compliment Ms. Mary Banzon who is duty manager at the hotel. She was extraordinarily helpful to me on a recent booking mishap. She went out of her way, with follow-up calls and made everything right. It is with people and staff like Mary that makes a business successful. If you are staying at the hotel and need help, she is really a wonderfully customer-focused manager.

Very disappointed with service. Needed information late at night so called front desk. Woman was short and unpleasant. It's hard to believe that a hotel such as this lets such unwelcoming people represent them.
Also, needed urgent help for door lock issue with our room and it took over half an hour to get someone to come. Would not stay there again.<//Review>

I have stayed at this hotel in the past, and was actually looking forward to this stay. So many things went wrong this time, it was very disappointing. First the room key didn't work, not a big deal, but a dark portent of things to come. Then the internet service was out, though hours of "work" from the Sheraton tech staff. I had checked in early so I could work on my laptop so this was VERY disappointing. Then the electricity went out which in turn caused the phones to malfunction. When my family called, they were told my line was busy, not that the phones were out. I believe that I should have been offered another room when staff realized the internet was down. They knew my situation. Very unfortunate.<//review>

The hotel was perfect location to LAX was at our terminal with in minutes. Friendly staff and great beds like always. Only complaint is we had 2 rooms and 1 got a backed up toilet while the other had a backed up sink.

Other then that stay was great for 1 night<//text>

<Review>I was really surprised by the location of the hotel parking for the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles. The self parking area was over 2 blocks from the lobby entrance. What really disappointed me, however, was that when I mentioned this to the person at the front desk, the individual tried to tell me that this was the same as all the other hotels near the airport. Having stayed at other hotels near LAX, I knew that this was not true. For a business traveler, I would not recommend this hotel due to the parking issue unless you are planning on using taxis during your stay.<//Review>< Pictures>

<date>1533660437458< /date><text>The hotel check-in was smooth after waiting for 10 hours plus for flight that ends up being delayed 15 hours. The LATAM airline provided a voucher with breakfast. The check-in staff didn’t explain any details about the conditions (perhaps they were tired too because it was close to 1 am). The room was spotless, clean and spacious.

The buffet breakfast at the Brasserie was nice but the waiter was pretty agressive and borderline rude. When I tried to sit on the patio, he was dismissive. Since then, I noticed that he was trying to make guests take the buffet option instead of a la carte (citing the slow service without saying how slow).

The manager Mike needs to commended, however. He went out of his way to help guest’s needs when the above-mentioned waiter said with a threatening tone that there was no breakfast included in the voucher (when there was in fact some values). The scary and uneasy feeling left by the waiter was relieved thanks to the manager. Thank you Mike!< /text>< user_id>

This is my third stay at this hotel.
My son is attending Loyola Marymount University and it is less than 5 minutes away. It is centrally located to both North and South destinations and very easy to get to. Facilities are great, and staying on Club level was gerat for breakfast and snacks.< /review>

<review>After a long day of travel and delays I arrived at the hotel along with what appeared to be a very large number of delayed travelers with vouchers in hand. I walked up to the SPG desk and was immediately helped.
After an upgrade and extended offers for points I found my room very comfortable and inviting. The staff was very professional and made me feel glad to be done traveling.<//review><GmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The bathroom was dirty, and mold in the shower.
When I called for any type of service, I always had to call more that one time. And a simple request at 10;33am, was not completed when returning at 9:27pm, and to top that, the staff clearly was not happy about having coming to the room to take care if the issue. The staff clearly made me feel like me requesting anything, was me doing something wrong, and I was a horrible guest.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Check-in is pleasant and relatively quick. The service and food at the restaurants in the hotel was excellent.

It is a great place to hold conferences because of the shuttle service to/from LAX and the abundance of rooms of various sizes together with the great service.</Review>

5 star staff - no question there, otherwise sadly lacking, everything seems dated, I had a special rate which was $109 plus taxes and I can get a better hotel in the UK for less than that.
Rack rate is somewhere north of $219 + tax.
Paying for a name and sorry to say, not as good as it should be.
Staff are excellent and will go the extra mile, if it weren't for the quality of staff........</Review>

Just ok! Initially paid $120 ish for basic king rm. Decided to upgrade (for $50 more) in order to enjoy a few extra amenities on the club level floors (i.e. continental breakfast --which consisted of mostly pastries...there were boiled & fried eggs, toast 4 bread, coffee, oatmeal and a scary looking hot item that I'm unsure what it was-- also free wifi...yes you'll hv to pay for access to their wifi in their regular rooms). I also valet parked for $49 nightly. It was colder in LA the night of Oct 13th and 14th...only the cold air initially worked in room. Had to request twice for someone to fix AC unit so that heat wld blow out. The room was nice except 1 of my pillows had brown stain on it...so wondered if it was even changed from previous person (the bathroom was nice). I doubt I wld stay here again. They do provide shuttle service to/from airport.</review>

<Review>Worst hotel I've been to. First off, what kind of cheap hotel charges for $17 for parking for one day? And $44 for valet. When we arrived, the water in our sink wouldn't go down. So we had to call for help, and when the employee came, he was rude and not responsive. Then when we tried to buy internet access (yes, they charge you for that too), they put us on hold for 15 minutes. For simple internet access that costs $13 a day. They try to get you with the "fanciest hotel in the area" scheme. Sure, this area isn't the best so obviously this sad excuse for a hotel is going to be the "fanciest" here.<//Review>< user_name>

Like all hotels close to an airport, you pay for your convenience with noise. I had them switch rooms twice but the runway noise was still so obnoxious I ended up sleeping on the floor in the bathroom.< /Review>

I prepaid for this hotel by reserving on spg website, and then upon checkout, they decided to charge me another 50% of the room charge. 

When I called them to rectify this, the accounting department was unreachable. By the 4th time I called back, finally the front desk decided to tell me the accounting dept was closed, yet they forwarded my call anyway. If you knew nobody was going to be picking my call, at least have the courtesy to tell me so i don't have to keep calling back on the same day!<//text>

< Review>
If I can do less I would do it.. I’m not that person who like to complain about everything and this is my first review all time..
the front desk staff are very rude and disrespectful (Sunday, January 7th, 4:15pm)
I had a simple question and they didn’t answer my question and with no asking me they transferred me to a Starbucks!!  I called the front desk again to ask why they did that to me and they said in a RUDE language                   (that because I don’t have answer) !!! Really a front desk employee working for a big name like a Sheraton and doesn’t have an answer of their own voucher!!! Plus they hang up the phone in the second time.. really!!! This what I get being their guest!!!

Sorry Sheraton I will never book with u again.< /Review>

<review>We arrived after a very long flight to find that our room that we had prebooked had been cancelled! Could this have been due to an oversell? We were given an upgrade and the room that we stayed in was pretty good. We we then embarrassed when we tried to charge to our room because we were not asked to provide a credit card at check in. In saying that the hotel is in a great location, nice rooms and public areas. Pool area could be maintained better by cleaning the ashtrays that are left on the tables on a more regular basis. Would we stay here again, probably.<//review>< pics>

The hotel & SPG disappointed me by not having my confirmed room ready... even after I personally contacted the hotel and SPG before my morning arrival after long flight from Australia. I even reserved the room for the previous day to ensure it would be available. That's why staff got low score for meeting my needs.</Review>< Pics>

Personnel were very attentive. Rooms were very nice and clean.
Only negative was the valet parking. We stayed one night and after picking up the car on the day of departure, it looked like the car had been parked where the sprinklers had been turned on. Water marks were all over the car. For $28 a night this was not what I had expected. Next time we stay, we will definitely self park.< /Review>

I was waiting to check-in next to the SPG status sign, but apparently on the wrong side of it, since a person who got there after me and did not have status was invited to check-in before me. I was then told my corporate card had a "hold" on it and couldn't be used. I found out the next day that there was no hold, and charging my hotel to my personal card will now cause me grief with my company. I requested a receipt and was told it would be emailed to me. I assented to this (although I would prefer a hard copy) however as of 4 days after my stay I have not received a receipt. I guess I'll have to waste time getting in touch with customer service just to get a receipt for my stay. Altogether a lot of extra work created by poor service at the front desk.</Text></record>

The hotel was fine but it offered nothing special. Wi-Fi was expensive and in and out and parking was either $50 for valet or $20+ to park in a shared airport lot half a block away. Has a Starbucks in the lobby and an In N Out a few blocks away which is nice. Great location if you want to be by LAX, otherwise it's only a decent location.<//Text>

Location was beautiful. However, the banquet service was subpar. It took a very long time for everyone to get their entrees and I never received my dessert when other people did. Also, I asked for coffee service and never received it. The venue was beautiful and was easy to access.</text>

1. Clean outside of windows in order to see the great view. Windows are filthy.
2. F&B prices are way too high. Other local hotels are much cheaper. Lower prices mean more activity in the lobby/restaurants = more fun.
3.The club is really a beverage outlet since the free food part is pretty lame.<//review>

Slow check in process, waited at least 20mins to get my room. Staff at bar counter didn’t even know you are here and had to ask for menu. Asked another staff who did not serve me initially for checks (because I couldn’t find the staff who served me initially), but was given cold shoulders! Terrible service!

The biggest problem I had with the hotel is the claim of "High Speed Internet Services". I am a computer systems administrator who works remotely so the internet connection is crucial to me. The internet connection was so slow that I had to miss two days of work, 8/16 and 8/17. When I called to ask about this I was told that a 2.0 Mbps connection was all I could expect. 2.0 Mbps may have been "high speed" in 1990, but in 2012 that connection speed is outdated and completely unacceptable.</review>

The rooms are nice and the amenities are nice but if you want to eat breakfast without it included with your room, it will be pretty pricey. The jacuzzi is a little small and the pool is not very deep. The rooms (at least mine) come with a free bottle of water each day.< /Text>

I have stayed at this hotel approximately 7 times in the last 8 years and I would highly recommend it for a stay near LAX. The hotel has been refreshed in the last year or so and it looks great. Be sure that you schedule extra time for the shuttle as tha LAX loop can move slowly at nearly any time of the day.<//Review>

One of the matresses in the room was in need of replacing. The maid service did not replenish the towels or bathing products even though I left the towels on the bathroom floor. I was staying there with my two children. It made it inconvienent. The lobby staff was great.<//text>

<rating>None</rating><resp>None</resp><user_id>None<//user_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>From the top:

I called their central reservations line because my SPG Starpoints account had gone inactive. First call: I was waiting for 17 minutes before I just hung up. Second call a little while later: I was holding for 15 minutes before I just gave up. Ended up making the reservation online figuring not getting the points was better than spending anymore time on the phone. Apparently checking in itself was supposed to reactivate my account, so we'll see.

Check-in was a breeze. I was able to get a higher floor away from the elevators as requested, which was also nice.

Room was wonderful, clean and comfortable, especially their bed (which Sheraton is known for).

Had a bite to eat at their bar, the sandwich I ordered was delicious! Chicken, provolone and avocado. The fries were only warm, so I didn't eat them. The manager asked me about it and apologized and comped my soda, which was fair.

Here's where things went wrong: When I turned on the shower, the water pressure was very low. I then noticed that a large amount of water was still coming from the faucet, so I fidgeted with it until it stopped, which did seem to help, but I still felt like what should have been a 5 minute shower turned into 20. I called the front desk to see if it was normal (we are in a drought) and they said they didn't think so. I just shrugged it off as I was clean, so didn't see the point in having anything done except telling them they should have engineering check it out before the next guest.

Then, there was the noise level: After 9PM, I could hear constant knocking in the hallway. I want to say that I thought it was housekeeping, but at that time? As this is a hotel airport, I realized that they probably do turn over rooms at all times during the day and not just between noon at 3? Their door latches are quite loud too. I could hear doors closing clearly at least 2 rooms down constantly

What completely ruined my stay: I only paid for a hotel room because I wanted to be refreshed upon returning home and that wasn't going to happen at my friend's home on a futon. I needed uninterrupted sleep. I put the "Quiet Please" sign on my door, unplugged the alarm clock to use that outlet for my cell phone to wake me at 9:30 a.m.. I went to bed at 1 a.m., allowing for 8.5 hours of sleep...until the alarm clock that had been unplugged for at least 6 hours at that point went off at 5:30 in the morning. To say I was confused by being woken up at that time by a strange noise coming from an unlit, unplugged machine would be an understatement. I was so confused, I must of hit the snooze button half asleep, probably believing I was dreaming. Until it woke me again a little later. I couldn't get back to sleep for a while after I turned OFF the alarm clock. Right as I managed to go back to sleep, MY cell phone alarm went off. I was SO exhausted. Just to make sure I wasn't losing my mind, I plugged in the alarm clock long enough to change the alarm time to a minute ahead of the actual time and unplugged it. Sure enough, it went off. Upon checkout, I took the alarm clock down to the front desk, showed the guy there the dark, unpowered alarm clock and waited a minute and it started going off.

The nice guy helping me apologized for the problems I had and said he was going to credit my SPG account 4,000 points. I don't know what that means! A free night? Half a night? Honestly, I was so tired at that point I didn't care. I just wanted to get home ASAP considering I was dead on my feet.

Thankfully, their airport shuttle was prompt and took me to LAX. Unfortunately, I was twice as tired as I was BEFORE my stay here. I know I got a great deal price-wise for the night, but I still ultimately ended up paying money for a bad night's sleep. :o(</review>< Date>

We called about our Wifi quite a few times and finally the gentleman said he added it as we are SPG members... never got Wifi. Bathroom was dirty: toilet seat and tub and trash can already had trash in it. The person answering for the front desk was not very patient or nice and when we realized that our wifi was not working (STILL) we opted to just go without rather than call again. We could also hear the people walking around above us... that was a first. It's also dissapointing that in a world of $2.50 Uber Eats/Door Dash delivery, Sheraton room service costs 16.5% of charge plus an extra $5 non tip fee. I could have stayed at a Best Western if I wanted this type of experience, only difference is that it would have been cheaper.< /Text>< Pics>

Desk service good,  room nice, but shuttle bus service from airport spotty.  Waited over 30 min for a shuttle, and it was completely full when it reached me at terminal 7.  Meanwhile Marriott had seven shuttles in the same span of time.</Review>

Stay somewhere else. Internet is bad, service is bad, decor is bad, feels like a dungeon. They even charge for the bottled water in the room and there is no refrigerator. Aside from all that the hotel is currently under renovation which leaves dirty common areas and limited access to what would be the restaurants and bar in the hotel. I can't imagine how it could be worse. Stay somewhere else.<//review>

My business associate and I had a great time staying here for a weekend convention we were attending. The staff was superb and the homeliness was great. There was an unfortunate event with the water supply at the hotel had to be turned off for the majority of a day due to a water main breaking. The staff was very courteous and was giving out water bottles to anyone who needed it -- they even gave away the water that was for sale in the room. The staff was very apologetic during this event. I would go back to this hotel just because of the great way the staff handled the situation.< /Review>

< Review>
Worth it for the cost, but the blanket on one of the two beds had not been washed and was clearly recently stained and dirty. Otherwise all was fine. I notified the Front Desk and they were willing to send Housekeeping up but it was late at night, so I slept in the other bed which was hopefully clean.</Review>

Had a really quick stay there, about 7 or 8 hours only. Bar was fine, with good food. Room was really good and staff was great (had a small issue only partially caused by me).
Thanks!<//text>

<text>Stay was generally pleasant, room was comfortable, check-in smooth and efficient. However, after check-out, I realized that I was charged an Internet Fee in error. The fee was supposed to be included in the rate. After several calls and e-mails to Sheraton Gateway LAX and Starwood, and after almost five months of follow-ups, I STILL HAVE NOT HEARD BACK ABOUT MY DISPUTE. I would get emails to pass the buck around and toss me around to Starwood or Sheraton, and at one point, was even directed to a completely different Sheraton in a different country. This experience has completely soured me with Sheraton and Starwood. It is a shame because in the past I have had generally pleasant experiences with Starwood properties. But the inefficient and total lack of response to a simple dispute is just unacceptable.< /text>< user_id>

I was both surprised and pleased with the helpfulness of the staff and the pleasant manner in which I was greeted each day. The service went beyond my expectations. the rooms were spacious, comfortable, and attractive. I will certainly plan to stay at the Sheraton again when I'm in the area.</Review>

No parking unless you want to wait for valet. Parking lot is behind hotel and is packed. Took 20 minutes to check in. Long line at front desk. Fire alarm went off in the middle of the night, twice. Toilet paper roll was wet. Yuck! Staff was nice.<//Review>

I was put in a dirty room with trash from the previous guest and urine on the bathroom floor. When this was brought up to the concierge desk, they didn’t seem shocked about it at all and their apology was less than sincere as well! I would also agree with another reviewer on the food not being worth the price at the restaurant.</Text>

<review>The web site for the hotel was not easy to navigate, was vague in the amenities offered, no complimentary breakfast, furniture in the room looks good but very uncomfortable to sit in. The internet was was difficult, a lot of proxy errors when trying to use it for work. $3 for a bottle of water, come on, most places that is complimentary. Bed was not very comfortable, bathroom was dirty, I realize you are in business to make money, but when I can go elsewhere in the same area get better service, clean room, amenities are better, such as evening reception, morning breakfast, both complimentary, chairs that are both inviting and comfortable to use I will go elsewhere in the future.< /review><UserId.>None<//UserId.><username>DLL1< /username></record></dataset><record>

<name>EM2131</name><review>Had an overnight layover in LAX from an international flight so I booked this hotel to get some rest before my next leg. Unfortunately, I didn't get much rest.

No shuttle for the first 40 minutes I waited (supposed to run every 10-15 min) and then when one did come by it just kept driving by. Had to call the hotel and request a shuttle stop for me and the several people also waiting. Finally, after an hour and watching several other hotel shuttles stop several times, our took us to the hotel.

Exhausted, I checked in. Received an upgraded room which was great. Unfortunately, the walls are so thin I couldn't get much sleep. There are paper thin walls and then there is what this hotel has. I woke up several times thinking people were in my room because I could hear the conversations so clearly. 
Not sure what the value of the club was. It doesn't offer anything great.
Only plus was the restaurant was open late and the food was good!
In the end, with the lengthy shuttle wait and constant noise, I didn't actually get much rest.<//review>< Rate>

This hotel is big, so it lacks personality, and it appears to have been some time (if ever) since the rooms were upgraded. The rooms are fairly comfortable, but the bathroom is very small and totally dated. Airport noise is present, but it didn't bother me...think twice if you don't like jet engines.

Platinum received room on club level, nothing else. Club was large but food was mediocre. Adult beverages are available for $$s.< /text></record>

<review>Hotel was fine, and in fact I have used this for my groups twice in the past. Unfortunately this time there was a party on my floor with yelling and doors slamming until 2:30am. As an SPG member, I usually have complimentary water in the room, but none this time. I also asked for a room near an elevator, and ended up with a room very far away. By the time I lugged my 3 bags there, I was too tired to do anything more with it. Staff was great, bed comfy and my last suggestion, add OWN TV (Opray Winfrey Network) in your CABLE line-up!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

We stayed at the hotel for three nights.

Got upgraded to a corner suite, which was spacious. One flaw though - there was only one TV for sitting area and the bedroom. The positioing of the TV was difficult.

Club Lounge was great. Staff was helpful.< /Review>

The staff was very friendly, and always greeted me with a smile. This is one of the best beds I've ever slept on!! The internet is very hit or miss, and over priced.

<Time>1530906189281<//Time><Rating>1<//Rating><review>Your staff had no idea how to answer any of the questions we had and we were not given an overview of hotel amenities at check in.  A front desk agent did not know what an itemized receipt was, nor did she know what a hand towel was.  The bell staff and concierge did not know how to answer simple directions on how to get to a local grocery store and gave me an attitude when I asked for a map of the area.

We were at the event for a conference and had to haul our heavy boxes to our room without assistance of a bell cart because the bellmen wouldn't trust us to bring it back.  I run a low-funded nonprofit and we could not afford to pay a bell person.  My husband and I have worked in the hotel industry for years, those bell carts are some of the least expensive out there.  It was ridiculous that we could not use one for 10 minutes to drop off boxes of heavy items.  We worked at a high-end Hilton resort with 1400 rooms and bell carts worth more than double the worth of the ones at Sheraton Gateway and they were lent out to guests without issue.

Speaking of boxes, if you are going to have conferences in your hotel, you really need to have a pack and ship center.  We shouldn't have to go online, make an account, and then pay a ton of money to print the label at your establishment.  If nothing else, your shuttle should be available to drive us to the local Marriott to ship the items.

On top of all of this, we had to change our room the second day because there was a maggot infestation in the bathroom.  Four people were sent up to my room with no idea of what to do about it.  The first came up when I was not in the room and I had a message on our machine that they didn't come in because we "had a dog".  At check in, I verified we had a rabbit, not a dog, who was penned when in the room and informed the maintenance staff before leaving that they can come in and that the rabbit would be with me downstairs.  I eventually spoke to a manager and had us moved; however, by the time we packed up our stuff the room was given away to another guest so we had to wait for another reassignment.  This time, we were moved to a room that was not up to standards in accordance to the hotel's contract with the Animal Rights National Conference, as our bedding was made with down, aka murdered animal feathers.

"Live plucking causes birds considerable pain and distress. Once their feathers are ripped out, many of the birds, paralyzed with fear, are left with gaping wounds—some even die as a result of the procedure. Workers often sew the birds’ skin back together without using any anesthetics.

That’s not all—buying down can also support the cruelty of the foie gras and meat industries because many farmers who raise birds for food make an extra profit by selling their feathers as well. At the slaughterhouse, many of these birds are improperly stunned, which means that they are still conscious when their throats are cut and they are dumped into the scalding-hot water of the defeathering tank." -PETA

Speaking of the conference, when we arrived neither the concierge staff nor the kitchen staff knew of the vegan options offered so we had to order in from another restaurant after a 12 hour day of traveling. We checked in with the conference leads a few days later and they told us that your staff should have been up to date on that information by then.

Oh, and can we talk about the unreliability of the wifi in the meeting rooms?  We bought the code to use at our booth to make credit card transactions and we used up all of our cell phone data because the internet would not hold up.

Finally, your checkout policy is weird.  Most hotels let the guests fulfill the checkout process within an hour of leaving the room.  We were told we could not do this and had to rush to hand over the keys on the way out. Very inconvenient.

If you are going to stay here, be sure to ask for an inside room.  Otherwise, you'll hear planes landing the entire night.

I've stayed at sketchy motels that run better than this hotel.  We will not be staying here again.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Most convenient for returning on rental cars and you wont be late for your flight unless--Zzz

Down Side- Location of the hotel is at the airport area so the air around is polluted with jet fuel sheers and also would encounter some minimal oil sheers if you are driving around the area. Not Too Bad.</Review>

A friend was joining me for the trip so I called a few days ago and changed my reservation to 2 beds. when checking in the agent did not reconfirm room type so we got all the way to the 1st room assigned and realized they had checked us in a King. I had to return to the lobby at 9;00 pm after a 2.5 hour drive from Palm Springs to get another room.

Also, I meant to notify engineering but the water nozzle in the shower did not work properly. When you slid the lever to the right to turn from tub to shower only 1/2 the water can from the shower head, the rest ran down the drain (room 1075). Also the shower did not drain very well.
Other than those items, we had a nice stay and the staff was nice and friendly.

<text>Please keep in mind that you are in the "Hospitality" industry.
Hospitality was unsatisfactory / poor.
Food "Service" was delivered by less than customer service staff.
Considering the overall poor service from most of the staff, I would conclude a problem with management. Moral that low and thoroughly weighted throughout the staff only directs my review towards management whom set that tone of less than hospitable.</text>< Pics>

<text>The prices for food and drink are outrageous. The food was OK but not exceptional and did not warrant the price. Several of my fellow attendees volunteered the same remarks. The price for Starbucks coffee was almost twice what I have typically paid. I guess they believe that they can charge a lot if they have what they perceive to be a captive audience.</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I had my son's wedding in this hotel. We had a room which had dirty towels on the floor and a messy used bed upon entrance!!! I called the room service at least 6 times and after waiting and disconnecting and transferring so many times, they screamed at me rudely that their system shows the room has been cleaned!!! So, I was lying that there is wet towels in the bathroom's floor with messy beds, apparently!!! Nobody believed me, nobody.... I gave up.... I asked for toilet paper in all my phone calls for the whole stay time but nobody cared.... I gave up again... I had to get in the hallway and find a cart and take one... It made me so angry and upset, knowing it is my son's wedding at this famous hotel and this is how they treat us...   When I found the manager, he told me he will help me in my next stay at this hotel...  Help me? Help me what?? The room was supposed to be with breakfast and they refused the breakfast and at the end they offered a simple breakfast for all this frustration. I will never ever use Sheraton in my future trips, never, very bad experience....< /review>

When I booked the room I specifically paid for a corner suite and a few days before I talked to the staff and I was assured they had blocked a high floor view with a runway view. But when we showed up all the had was a suite on the 3rd floor or a standard room on a high floor. Very poorly handled by the check in agent until the manager came out and at least adjusted the rate. Over all very disappointing. The club is also a joke, the staff is super rude. And when asked for ice their reply was the ice machine is broken. :( Needles to say that we stayed there about a week before and the ice machine was still broken. Overall a very disappointing stay. Staff indifferent.</Text>

I stayed in room 637 and found some conditions not up to par. The toilet seat was ready to fall off, the hot water handle and attached pipe were extremely lose which made it hard to operate, the mattress was far past it's usefull life. I was either on a peak or in a valley and it squeaked a lot. The desk chair was very dirty. The hotel is very nice, just not this room.</text>

I'm not a fan of big hotels, but we enjoyed our stay here. The rates was reasonable for the convenience they had offered. The breakfast buffet was a delight & the service was exceptional.<//review>

Evening food consisted of a frig. of bottled water. Front desk said there is 24 hours snacks. 'Evening food' means until 7:00pm. They should say 'no food after 7 pm" at front desk and online.Other guests were also complaining because they were disappointed there were not even 'peanuts'. Night staff did give $30 credit right away, but when checking out, morning staff had 'attitude' and challenged the credit. She did give it to me in end. Club Floor breakfast was some boiled eggs, yoghurt and various rolls. Not much for paying so much extra money. Will try not to stay here again, but was close to LAX and did not hear airplane noise.</Text></record>

<Text>It's my go-to-hotel whenever I need to stay near LAX. As an SPG Platinum, I'll usually get an upgrade to whatever they can upgrade me to, without a hassle. Their club lounge always has a decent selection of food & beverages. Their fitness centre has plenty of and a variety of equipment for most workouts. I've never had to wait long for their regular airport shuttle to/from LAX (and they're as close as you can get to the terminals). Easy to get to/from with their location on Century near Sepulveda. Their turn-down service is a class act, when one returns from a day of meetings to find his room ready-to-crash---lights dimmed, curtains closed, duvets pulled back, chocolate waiting. I like that their corproate rates include valet parking, as self-parking there is indeed a p.i.t.a. As long as Sheraton Gateway LAX keeps up the good consistency, I'll consistently stay there.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Although I select this hotel for its proximity to LAX, it is a great choice in every way. The restaurant, bar, and fitness center are great amenities, and the Starbucks in the lobby is a great way to start the morning. I have stayed at this hotel several times and will return for future trips to LA.< /review>

Not bad...but wrong hotel. We meant to book the one hosting the meeting. Nice if you need to be close to the airport, but a $40 Uber ride about everywhere bc there are no regular Uber’s. Just UberX and pool. So being that far was not a plus if you are there to explore. I swear I spent $300 in Uber’s in 3 days. No room service, no mini bar, but clean and ok other than that.</text>

Although the hotel has had a full renovation, the menu leaves a little to be desired. I travel and stay often at the Sheraton Gateway but the menu in the restaurants is stagnant and overpriced. The food is good quality, but if they would offer a special every once and a while, it would give some variety for the many who stay on a regular basis.</Review>

<Review>How do you get entered into the wrong room in the system but your key works on the right room. Why are people trying to get into the room TWICE. Why is the AC turned off completely with the inability to turn it back on so you have to call the service desk after dealing with it all night. How is it I spend 72 dollars just for a SMALL dinner and two drinks and the waiter only claim to my table once to ask if I needed anything having sat there for 2 hours. The food is overly fancy and pricey. I couldn't get a simple scoop of ice cream or chips and salsa at the bar. The billing was a mess and after spending a half an hour, I had to leave and continue to deal with the mess over email. I would not be staying here if I did not have to.</Review>< Pictures>

Outstanding service and great staff. My only issue and they are addressing was 5.5 Mb/Sc Wireless speed.

<Review>Upon arrival we are told that they were overbooked and our room had been sold. We would have to stay in a smaller room than we ordered. We were offered no compensation and told that we would need to switch rooms tomorrow. We came back in the morning to switch rooms and were told by a different employee that we should have been offered compensation. She then upgraded our room and gave us 40 dollars of credit. Their policies seem to depend on who you talk to.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

The front desk had SPG line for Gold and Platinum, but no one was there to help. The agent did not help me with priority either during check-in or check-out.

The phone didn't work properly in the room.

There was no mini-bar or fridge in the executive suite.

I think I wasted my money here with the stay.<//text>

<review>Let me start by saying I travel and stay at the Sheraton Gateway frequently. Overall this is a great hotel, close to LAX and the locations I need to visit during my time in town. However, they are going through some renovations, which I can appreciate as the hotel was starting to look a bit aged. This particular visit has been less than stellar, with my room being a total mess when I checked in and the construction is still ongoing at nearly 9pm.< /review>< Pics>

The past stay wasn't good. I had to press clothes for the next day but there was no iron. I called housekeeping (no answer). The front desk said they'd send one up. I stayed up an hour - no iron. Called again. They said they'd get one to me right away. Another 45 mins passed and no iron. I checked out the next morning and the front desk offered 2000 pts and a weak apology. Weak solution/apology for attending a meeting in wrinkled clothes.</text>

Our stay was marred by some deficient facilities: Our toilet became plugged (I can't remember the last time that happened to us in a hotel room), the desk lamp burned out, the iron didn't heat up, and the shower was lukewarm with no water pressure. With the exception of the shower (which we didn't mention for we were rushed to check out), the staff was great in replacing the bulb and providing a new iron. Other than these issues, the room was nice, the bed was really comfortable, and the WiFi was reasonably fast.< /review>

<text>I arrived at hotel around 0200 when the check-in system was turning over for the next day. I had to wait about 30 minutes for my room. Although I understand the situation and the check-in agent was great about it, I find it unacceptable and very inconvienant, At that time, after a long day/night of work all one wants is to get to the room and relax.</text>< pics>

Notified the front desk again and they arranged for the rest room to be cleaned. Next morning tub still did not drain - original problem was never fixed - Poor maintenance and service.

Also - $22 breakfast buffet without a chef attended omlette bar? - Way over priced.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Overall, the room was comfortable and clean. There was an issue with doors slamming all day and night, in the hallway. I was close to the Club entrance, so it may have been those doors during the day. The club snacks were so-so, and we had to pay for alcoholic beverages, which was surprising to me. Otherwise, it was fine.</review>< Resp>

The concierge was unhelpful and reception unreasonable. My bill was 100.48 and I gave 120 but the receptionist could not find change so I had to tell him that I will forego my .52 cents change when he could just easily could have said don't worry about the .48 cents!! 22 dollars for breakfast is very steep especially when our kids only had a drink and cereal. Some serious rethinking on Sheraton to do!<//review>

Right near LAX...I could see the planes land from my 3rd floor window. would be nice if they had a more affordable restraunt on-site, but other wise, really great place. Oh and they have a $5.00 shuttle shop there. The shuttle takes you to the beach :)<//Text>

<review>NO FREE WIFI but everything else is good with the room. nice spacious and has a cool magazine. the reception girl is not that friendly. but she is hot so maybe that is why she was unfriendly . because the airport is right across from the hotel, you can sometimes hear the planes coming in on the runway, but i sleep with earplugs so i didnt hear a thing :)<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d<//gmapID></record>

We were concerned about noise from the airport, but the room was very noise-proof. They even comped access to the concierge lounge, which was a real plus for us. Parking is a problem, but we discovered an all-day lot right next door and parked all-day each day for half what the hotel wanted for valet parking on-site and we could even see the car from our room!<//text>< pics>

Staff was very helpful and personable during my stay, particularly Ms. Diane Cheek, who went out of her way to make us feel welcome.

I do think food prices are too high in hotel restaurants. Only the prices at the Starbucks located within the hotel are comparable to food avaiable at commercial places outside of the hotel.<//Review>

Upon checkin we were assigned a room, unfortunately it was a double queen room instead of the king that was reserved. The desk resolved this by sending keys up to us, although that took several minutes. It would have been faster for me to go to the desk, but I appreciate the effort to save me the trouble. The staff at this location make every effort to resolve any issues.
The tub was very slow to drain, but this seems to be a typical experience for me at this location, it is unsettling to stand in deep water while showering.
Thank you for a nice stay, considering we arrived just after midnight. The quietness and comfort of the room fit our needs perfectly.<//Review><Time>1395100800000<//Time>< Resp>

When I checked out at 4am the bill had more than $400 in errors. The manager promised to fix them and email me a revised bill. Since I had a plane to catch I agreed. I received the "revised bill" and none of the charges had changed.
The restaurant in the hotel is very over priced and the food is average to poor.
Walk next door to the Other hotel to eat. good food reasonable price.</Review>

I have stayed in this hotel a few times before and always liked it. The hotel is going through some remodeling and the valet, rooms, and some of the services did not seem well prepared. 38.00 for a valet that did not answer the phone from the room and a wait of close to 20 min for my car. REALLY?, and you charge for that? Room had torn wall paper and beat-up and torn chairs. I understand that the hotel is remodeling, but I paid the same as I did the previous visits and expect the same quality of room and service.< /text>

We were staying at the Hotel and decided to go to the Marina. While we were there, a dog attacked my wife and we had to go to the emergency room. When we got back to the hotel, we told the front desk that we had to cut our stay short because of my wife's injury. Mustafah, of guest realations, found out and literally chased us down as we were going to our room. He apologized for our situation and offered us a complimentary desert or beverage at the Hotel restaurant, also received a 30 dollar discount on the room. We just want the thank Mustafah and the whole staff at the Hotel for all there concern. The Hotel was excellent and clean rooms with a excellent restaurant experience, with Hime our waiter.

<text>Attending a conference there, I had no other option for lodging. With the room charges of $137/night (convention rate, room tax, and tourism "assessment" ), I was disappointed that there was no complimentary coffee in the lobby, overpriced restaurants, no free internet access in the room, or free parking. The room had outdated décor with some peeling wallpaper, and the bathroom was small. This is not what I expected from a Sheraton-- my stay at another hotel when traveling the night before provided much more comfort (as it guaranteed), and it was more affordable.<//text>< gmapID>

<review>Staying in on the Club Floor I expect a high quality of service. I did not receive cleaning service until I requested it and there was no reason given for not cleaning the room. So it appeared that housekeeping just forgot. Poor quality of towels was also a concern. When checking in there was no explanation of internet service given and I had to call twice to get an understanding of whether I had to pay or not.<//review><rate>None</rate>< pictures>

< Review>
I'm gessing that this was about my eight stay in the past year. I've got a client about 14 miles away; needless to say, I pass quite a few hotels to get to this one. Here, I am treated well - and my impression is that it's not JUST because I'm a regular. The fitness center is fabulous, with windows that open and through which you experience actual sunlight. If you're lucky enough to have access to the Executive Lounge, well, that's nice too. The rooms are well insulated against noise. The only small bummer is that there isn't a hotel-owned parking lot that can be charged to the room folio.</Review>

Charged my card for a reward stay after I had checked out and confirmed $0 on my bill!! Told me they put me in a room with two beds even though there was only 1.. when I called to get a rollaway they told me it would be $25 even though it was their mistake and I am an SPG platinum.  I called to get the charge fixed, left a message, nothing got done and they didn’t call back.  I think they’re trying to cheat those using points for a stay, BEWARE!!

***update***
They’re fighting me and my credit card company now and forcing us to produce documentation when they clearly have the same documentation.  They wanted me to contact them which I made several attempts to do and they never responded.  Steer clear of this property, the management are scammers and extremely unprofessional.  This is coming from a Starwood platinum member for reference.

***update 2***
They still won’t respond to my calls or emails or messages sent from Marriott corporate to address this debacle.  They can’t or won’t provide me with a copy of my folio and they’ve made it impossible to dispute by providing falae documents to my credit car company.  So they stole 10,000 Starwood points AND $$ for one nights stay.  DON’T STAY HERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!! Management completely lacks integrity.  If they wanted to make this right they would have reached out to me long ago, instead they ignore me.</Text>

<Rating>None</Rating><text>Two Things I always pay attention to when I first check in to the Hotel and into my room -

1. Front Desk Associated does he/she look like they enjoy assisting Customers.

2. Room Cleanliness

For the most part, the Front Desk Staff was good to us however, the next morning, I went up to one of the Male Front Desk Associates and he looked angry and actually answered a bit angry when I asked him about what steps are required to take my vehicle out of the Self Park Lot. He had a bit of attitude and sounded a bit sarcastic/irritated in regards to my question.

Also, the night we checked in when we got to our room, my girlfriend decided to take a shower and the tub was stuffed up water to her ankles. Fortunately, the staff responded to our needs and took the necessary measures to fix it right away.

The last reason, Self Parking is a bit of an inconvenience. I don't like how far out it is and the fact that Sheraton Getaway shares parking with others. Our clean car also got some sort of brown spots all over the car not sure if it came from Palm Tree in front of vehicle.

Other than that liked everything the Housekeeping and Waiters!</text>< pics>

<review>We were checking in late at night and there was a long line to check in. There was only 1 person helping at the reception. I saw more people in the back but they wouldn't come out to help. We were not happy as it was late at night and tired. It seems all of the people waiting in line were getting tired of waiting. We were disappointed this visit but the room was nice.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Hotel is close to the airport with a shuttle that runs 24 hours a day every 10 or so minutes so this is convenient. Concierge was also helpful. Rooms, service and amenities were average.< /Text>

On request, staff brought us a refrigerator for the room, and de-feathered the bed, both very promptly. Also cafe/bar staff were very helpful and flexible when we ordered a late-night meal.

On the other hand, parking staff were very particular about how long our car could stay downstairs before incurring a huge overnight charge, and not pleasant about it.< /text>

I have had a rough day and expect to have a great night at sheraton LAX. I called the guest service and ask for free wifi access code. He mumbled the password. I was asking for clarification and he shouted to me at the phone. This is truly an unacceptable behavior in highly service industry. This should be improved by Sheraton so that other people would not experience this.</Review>

The staff was friendly but the wait to check in was long. There were 2 staff checking people in and then one decided to walk away to make the wait even longer. The room was nice but the phone next to the bed was broken and the bed was extremely hard. The convenience to the airport was great. Having the ability to take a free hotel shuttle to LAX was nice.
The outside noise was loud even in the evening.</text>

< Review>
This is not one of the better Sheraton properties. Our room was dated, handles falling off closet door, bathroom needs updating. Self parking is OFF PROPERTY a block away. It seemed very unsafe and I am surprised Sheraton would send their guests to such a facility. No instructions were given by front desk how to use the facility and get the hotel daily rate. Next day we valet the car and was told a reduced price and when we checked out they did not honor the rate we were quoted, The valet manager spoke to us at length and made as feel as the he didnt believe us. The lower rate was honored but it work and a uncomfortable obtaining it. If you need to go to the front desk prepare to wait. Most times it is understaffed. Even when I was in the SPG Preferred section it made no difference. The front desk seemed indifferent and called other guests ahead. Each time at front desk was a min of a 5 min wait. I made the hotel aware of my experience and Mustafo (office manager) emailed stating that some points would be credited the next day. I replied to his email and he didnt respond. When the points did not arrive a month later I emailed Starwood corporate and the points were added to my account. I wont stay at this property next time in LA. The best thing about this is the club lounge. Its better than most and staff very friendly.</Review>

I have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have enjoyed all my stays. This stay however, was not as enjoyable. The power went out due to a storm...I get it that the staff couldn't do anything to fix that, but the aftermatth was one excuse after another....I couldn't get connected to the internet when the power came on...the excuse was due to the power outage. Then I had no hot water in my room...guess what...that was blamed on the power outage as well. I find it hard to believe that a hotel with boilers heats their water with electricity instead of natural gas. Then during breakfast I heard more staff blaming this and that on the outage. Give it a rest!!! I had to take a cold shower since I was not offered a different room.<//text>

On initial check in, I was unable to enter room. Keys did not work. Second night, went to the excellent hotel restaurant for dinner, returned and unable to enter room. Again called Guest services and Security was quickly sent up to let me in room and I was informed I would have 2000 points added to my account for the inconvenience.<//text>

One of the worst hotel experiences I ever had, rude registration lobby employees. Even though I have already prepaid through the Orbitz online booking service, I was told that I have to wait until the system is back and running.  I mean,  I just got off from a long flight and needed a bed right away.. and when I tried to  cancel I couldn't because they said there's no refun.. the service was terrible,  but to be fair the room was nice, clean, and comfortable< /text>

<Rating>None<//Rating><text>The good is that the staff at the hotel seems very friendly and I had no problem with them. Shuttle bus was easy enough for both going to and from hotel, and seems to run every 15-20 minutes.

Unfortunately, that's about it. Rooms were very small (smaller than NYC hotels) and the lighting in the room was terrible. Showers are small, and the shower-head was at my chin/shoulders which meant you needed to squat down to wash your hair. (I'm average height for a male). They did have the curved shower-rod which gave a bit of shoulder room, but it's still extremely cramped.

However, the real kicker is that food prices at the hotel are embarrassingly high. There is a markup on top of the standard hotel markup. There are not many food options nearby, so you are captive to the hotel, which is probably why they can get away with such a high markup.

Club lounge was fair. Attendants very nice, evening spread ok (there was one hot dish), but the breakfast is embarrassing. Food quality fine, but the only protein is hard boiled eggs, no hot items besides oatmeal.

For a very large hotel, you'd expect more. Absolutely a shame since the staff tries very hard, but decisions by management (room layout, pricing, etc.) mean the hotel gets a bad review which ultimately hurts the staff by influencing bookings.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<review>This hotel was fine for a quick airport stay. Biggest negative is soundproofing is poor and noise from others opening and closing doors and moving around their rooms was disturbing, as was the air conditioner which went off and on and was quite noisy - room got too warm and then too cold. Also, no fridge or mini bar in room - first hotel we've stayed I for years that didn't have one and amenities weren't great. Lobby was also quite noisy. However, the room and bed were quite comfortable and clean, and the staff was extremely courteous and accommodating - when we called to say the people next to us were making very loud noise and banging doors, security was up in minutes. We would stay again if we needed a hotel near LAX, but do feel there is room for improvement.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Avoid this hotel, I booked double bedroom and received a single room when I checked in. I asked to get one more bedding, there is no one left. Close to airport and highway, very noisy.< /Text>

< Review>
So after staying here and feeling pretty unhappy about the stay I decided to let a few days in before I finally decide if I should drop a review or not. Ive decided that the services and overall experience was pretty bad so I have to leave a review.

I arrive at the hotel after a full day of driving from the bay area to meet up with some of my friends who drove from Texas. Our arrival time was about midnight on the date of our reservation.

-checking in-

>Upon reaching the front desk the clerk was noticeably in a bad mood or a hurry or something.
>I try to stay out of her way and just provide my ID and credit card.
>Clerk says in a snappy tone that I am not 21, therefore not allowed to check in.
>I explain I was not aware this specific sheraton had a check in age of 21
>She calls her manager, who also seemed to be in a bad mood told me go somewhere else
>I explain its been a very long day and I just want to rest
>they dont care
>I ask what options do I have
>They tell me either I bring someone whos 21+ or they will cancel and refund my reservations
>I remember I have a friend who is 22 and I tell the front desk I will be right back to get my friend
>amazingly the clerk snapped at me saying how I cant bring someone random off the streets into the hotel.
>I didnt pay much attention to her and went to get my friend
>fast forward 20 minutes and the clerk finally goes through with my reservation but she tells me the room that I had requested for (a double queen) is no longer available.
>(i thought online reservations guarantee the room?)
>clerk offers a single king room
>I explain how we have 5 people and that wont work
>clerk doesnt seem to care and has a take it or leave it attitude
>having no choice I take the room with a rollaway bed
>clerk did not ask for SPG member number

-parking-
>$17 a day for parking
>parking lot is in horrible condition and finding a spot is not guaranteed.

-room-
>room was clean and overall nice
>flatscreen TV had screen problems that made the picture very very dark
>room service request for extra blankets take an hour to arrive
>cramped room for 5 people

-checking out-
>we decided to cut our trip a day short and leave a night in advance because of the inconvenience and discomfort.
>check out clerk was helpful and things went smoothly

Now im sitting here checking my credit card statement and there is an extra $75 from the hotel that was not included in our original room bill and I have to go figure out why theres yet another charge.

-bottom line-
I cant say I recommend this hotel for various reasons. If you are only staying here for a layover or transit I believe that will be just fine for your needs. Avoid if you are coming here for a vacation or getaway.<//Review>

<Text>By far, the worst hotel Ive stayed in.  My partner and I had two Macbooks stolen from our room on June 17th and Sheraton LAX is doing nothing to compensate for it. I highly suggest for anyone looking to book this hotel, to look elsewhere. This is worst than staying in a MOTEL.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

This hotel is clean, has a good airport shuttle service, pretty good workout facility and has a trolly near by to take you to Manhattan Beach or other locations. This is my favority spot on quick lay overs in LA. Breakfast in the morning is pretty good although I wish that it started earlier.</Review>

Its a Sheraton but it feels like a cheaper four points. The lobby is a sterile 1970s lobby that has outdated poorly designed 70s features. It echoes, is uninteresting and cold. The rooms have a mismatched collection of cheap furniture and finishes. The bathroom sink and counter is really awkward because you have to work off a lower counter and search under the elevated sink to find things. Its as though they ran out of money and didn't have any way of making it nice so we're stuck with what we have. Its such a shame too. The previous hotel needed some updating but this version is far worse than before. I have options. I won't subject myself to such an ugly, uncomfortable experience. 

By the way, I tried to get a receipt for work and couldn't get one unless I went to the front counter or called to have someone email it separately. No other way to get it. I called and no one answered. No telling when I will have that.

First of all - Anca at the front desk, is amazing. She was friendly, professional, attentive, and very prompt.

I stay at this hotel frequently, and unfortunately this trip I had to spend Thanksgiving at the LAX Sheraton Gateway. I found it extremely insulting that their signage indicated they were "so thankful" to host guests for a Thanksgiving dinner. For $50.00+ (including 20% tip, tax, and a non-alcoholic beverage". Fifty dollars?? Of course they're thankful for the people being forced to pay that in honor of the US Holiday.

I listened to a man and woman tell their three children that they couldn't afford to have Thanksgiving! I was disgusted. And make no mistake, this was not a hearty sized meal. It was of average proportion, with dry meat.

I overheard the waitstaff joking of the food quality and portions sizes with respect to the Amount being charged to the guests. With the other employee commenting "everything around here is closed, 'they' know what they are doing."

This is unacceptable and SPG Corporate should address this price gouging event.

Please search YouTube for Gateway Sheraton Thanksgiving - I will be posting a video of my bill and the meal that I received.</text>

I've stayed at Sheraton LAX many time before so know the hotel well. Did not expereinced "WOW" factor in customer interaction at the time of check-in and during my stay. Would appreciate if hotel could meet customer expectation especially for repeat customers.

Mattress spring noise was very notable.</review>

We were unable to get sodas in the morning, just tea and coffee, neither of which we drink. The lady was in such a hurry to clean up at the time of closing, she was pretty much taking your filled plates off the table. The breakfast buffet in the restaurant was subpar in comparison to similar hotels. But it was easy on and off the freeways. We enjoyed our stay.<//text>< pics>

Overall I have been pleased with this Sheraton location & stay there often. However my last stay was horrible. Mostly how the situation was handled. This was a 1 off situation and not typical of this location. During my last stay 1) upon arriving it took over 45 min to get checked in. This was due to an issue with their system being down to create key cards. 2) I wasn't given a key to get into my room. I had to wait another 20 mins for someone to come to my room & let me in my room. 3) Since I was NEVER given a key for my room, I couldn't leave and use the clubroom or the gym. 3) I was told I would get a key but was NEVER given a key. 

As a business traveler where my time is very valuable this was a HUGE inconvenience. I understand things happen but it's how you handle it. The team was basically like there was nothing they could do and treated me like "deal with it". The staff in NO WAY was apologetic or tried to appease guest for the MAJOR inconvenience this system outage cause. I did find it ironic that the system that takes my credit card/money of course wasn't down!< /review>

We last stayed in this Hotel in 2008, but on our recent overnight stay we were terribly disappointed. First of all when we arrived with five bags there was no-one to take our bags or offer to bring them to our room. Secondly when specifically requesting an early check in at time of booking as we were arriving from a 14 hour flight and would only be staying 15 hours we were told that there were absolutely no rooms available and with an unpleasant attitude from the guest assistant. Thirdly the room confirmation states that it has wifi... this is also misleading as it requires an additional surcharge.

On the other hand the room service was extremely fresh and the beds very comfortable.

In the future we will not be choosing the Sheraton Gateway unless the customer service improves out of sight.< /Review>

The hotel exterior looks really nice and is misleading to the quality. If you want a good night sleep then you shouldn't stay here. If you want to be able to walk to the airport then it is close enough.
The bed was uncomfortable as well as the pillows too flat. Sheets were over starched and felt like poster board. 
It is not well sound insulated for proximity to airport. You will hear people talking in the rooms next to you and all the way down the hall. You will be awoken by airplanes, neighboring rooms and doors opening and closing. 
The adjoining room door was not even secured with a lock, only a safety latch.

You could tell the bathroom was recently updated as the tile in the shower had grout spots hardened up all over which was not comfortable to step on. The cabinet drawers were falling apart.

Restaurant was horribly slow and the food was sub-par for the price.

Front desk staff and concierge were horrible. Very inefficient and not helpful. The concierge had no information about restaurants or events happening close by.

I recommend this hotel for outdoor activities since you won't have to be at the hotel.<//review>

I have stayed with Sheratons a number of times and specifically this one a couple of times. The towels are old and stained (I wash my car with softer towels). I asked housekeeping for fresher towels and the replacements were just as bad. The second day they didn't give me washclothes (found out as I was getting in the shower). The Internet was down frequently and specifically at night when I needed to do work.< /review>

<text>Recently spent a night on the Club floor the night before flying out of LAX. Booked the 14-day park-and-fly package, and it was a glorious choice. Made it for evening hors-d'ouevres which were also glorious. Shower had awful pressure, and the included liquid soaps didn't work, but the room itself was so wonderful that we didn't care about that small detail. Would always stay before flying out of LAX.</text>< pictures>

This hotel went out of its way to make me feel very comfortable, and finally made me understand why I am a Starwood member. This hotel treated me like a VIP, and gave me great service all around.

My only issue with this hotel was the Paparazzi Restaurant. There were 8 of us dining. 7 of us got out food, but 1 person, got the wrong dish ordered....and they didnt get their food till everyone else was close to be done. Then when it came out again, it was OVERCOOKed.......just not a good experience with the restaurant. But the hotel and the staff outside the restaurant was very good.<//Text>

We arrived and check-in was smooth. We self-parked the car as valet was $45 a night and self park was $17. The parking is across the street in the back of the hotel which as a female can be a little scary.

 The food choices are underwhelming. The bar or the Brassiere are the current restaurants. They do have a Starbucks that also sells food. Prices are typical for a hotel. The tuna poke was outstanding and is currently a special. Noodle soup was too salty, hamburger nothing special, onion soup served with croutons instead of toasted piece of bread. It made the soup soggy along with the fact it was also very salty and I like salt. We stayed on the Club level and had a great view. 

The room was nice but we had issues with the sink water which tasted like sulfur. We did complain and they adjusted are bill. They said there plummer is being renovated so it could be from that. We also had someone open our door during the night and they were going to check videos to see what happened. We received a credit and points for our inconvenience. 

The club was o.k. Breakfast eggs were barely warm, same with the egg rolls served as hor d'oeuvres. They had a machine that made lattes and other specialty coffees. Facilities there were very nice but they don't have a microwave there to make food hot and they weren't so accommodating. I asked for a plastic cup and they said they didn't have even though they have in the evenings. These are minor things but shows some of the frustration although minor. I believe with the renovations some of the issues will be resolved. 

 Internet was included by staying on the club level but we couldn't get internet in the seminar room. The company sponsoring the seminar would have had to pay additional for internet. This in this day and age is antiquated. Most hotels today provide free internet everywhere.<//Review>

Suite was fine, nothing special, but aggressively priced. Service, even on a slow night, wasn't great: bell hop took a while. Overall, however, despite minor issues, it's a great place to spend the night before an early flight.<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Will never go back. Wherever do I start?
1. The valet parking staff sternly warned us that we were not to leave a car for more than 10 minutes in front of the hotel while we checked in or we'd be charged the valet parking fee - which is somewhere between $22 and $35 depending on what kind of deal you get. Mind you, there's no temporary parking area to leave your car other than the valet.

2. The room we were given had a bed that was so old the impressions of a thousand guests before me were obvious. The bathroom had black mold in the tile grout. There were plastic wrappings around the smoke alarm and the sprinkler system. (I'll post the pictures if I'm allowed here...)

3. We were assigned another room. Asked a staffer with a badge and a radio which way to go to find it, and he said, "I really don't know," and walked away. (Apparently staff was told: "Beatings will continue until morale improves.")

4. Second room key didn't work. Sat in the hall with our luggage while my spouse went downstairs to inquire at the main desk. By the way, there are no chairs in the hall or by the elevator. Good thing I'm not an old lady or handicapped.

5. Was given a THIRD room, which looked okay, and indeed had a comfy bed and reasonable bathroom. Only problem was that the desk chair was ripped, big time. Nobody noticed this before? I have pix of this too!

6. Spouse was given a restaurant credit for our many troubles, which we appreciated. However, when we went to use this credit, we were told that the restaurant was closed. This was 6 p.m on a Sunday night, and it's kinda standard to eat dinner 'bout this time. Was there another place where we could get dinner, we asked? Nope. That restaurant was closed too. Only option was to eat dinner in the bar during a large pool party. Lots of people stared at us while we ate at our tiny round table. Upside was that the food we did get was absolutely delicious and the staff was nice. Kudos to the chef.

7. Parking for this hotel, if you don't do the very expensive valet, is around the back in an open lot, about a block away from the entrance. That means you should probably leave your luggage with the valet (oh look, a tip!) if you don't want to schlep your bags quite a distance. The entrance to the parking does NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT SHERATON, so you must be psychic to figure out if this is the assigned parking area which we'd already paid for. There is a parking structure across the street from the hotel but this is NOT where you should go.

I'm not usually a big complainer, but there were so many fails at this place that I felt I must WARN YOU TO RUN, don't walk, to another place.<//review>< pictures>

Good location right next to airport, friendly, prompt, but crowded shuttle. Busy hotel with conferences, meetings, and constant flow of passengers in and out. If you need something for a night or two in LA area, can't beat it. Good club lounge.<//Review>

During our stay in LA we booked the four points which was extremely small and outdated - we quickly upgraded to this hotel which was very clean, spacious and the staff was extremely friendly, nice and accomidating. I had 1 slight problem and when I contacted the night manger the problem was fixed in 10 minutes with the managers apoliges. I highly recommend this hotel<//review>

< review>
Checked in on a Sunday night hoping to quickly get to sleep. Didn't know that there was going to be a loud party in the pool area till 10:30 PM. Got a room on that side of the hotel, and could hear the music pretty clearly until it finally shut off a little after 10:30 PM. When I called to inquire about the level of the music, at first I was told it would be done at midnight, and was hung up on. When I called again, the time had changed to 10:30 PM, and was hung up on again.

Woke up around 2-3 AM both nights I stayed to the strong taste and smell of cigarette smoke in my room. I think somebody was taking a smoke break near an air intake or something. Worst experience I've had at an SPG hotel by far. Also undergoing renovations, but aside from the valet being understaffed or overworked, I didn't notice any problems due to the renovation. I absolutely won't stay here again.< /review>

I had a couple of meetings in LA and wanted to stay in a hotel near LAX. The Sheraton was perfect for this. The free shuttle bus between the hotel and airport runs every 10 mins or so and made travelling to and from the airport very easy. Inside I found the hotel to have professional and (extremely) helpful staff, comfortable and clean rooms and fantastic facilities around the hotel. The restaurants offered very high quality food and the pool area was nice to relax around. Even though the hotel is so close to the airport, you could barely, and rarely, hear noise from the planes. If I was to find any negative it would be that you had to pay for WiFi in the rooms, but this is a really great hotel. I will definitely stay again.< /Text>

<Review>The front desk staff works really hard to make sure that people feel welcomed and well served. The lobby is nice and there is a very convenient free shuttle service to LAX.

It is clear that this hotel has been around for a while. Although they have kept up with all the changes that Sheraton requires, greater investment is needed to get the hotel to where it should be. For example, the light shade in the room had been torn and would not sit properly on the light. In trying to adjust it, I noticed that several other people had tried to do this and there where many holes in it where others had tried to make it work. This is a small thing, but it points to a lack of care.

The rooms seemed clean and the beds were comfortable.

I would return because of the service and the access to LAX.< /Review>< pics>

< review>
This started several months ago when we attempted to reserve a room for a handicapped individual. Multiple phone calls still couldn't ensure that one of the occupants of the room would have a handicapped accessible shower, let alone the requisite refrigerator that was absolutely necessary. Two occupants were to use the room, both elderly women and one more handicapped than the other. It turns out the roll-in bed that one was expected to sleep in would be difficult for a small person to to be comfortable in, let alone an adult with back problems which were extremely exacerbated after one night spent on the bed. Fortunately, an astute member of the staff suggested a room change after multiple complaints about the telephone (see below) and the guests were transferred, including the refrigerator. The problem is that the refrigerator was not plugged in at its new destination, thereby ruining the contents.

The telephone at the first room only worked intermittently, as callers were unable to get through, despite the fact that neither occupant left the room the first day that they stayed in the hotel and they never realized that voicemails were being left. Complaints to the front desk were only addressed on the second day when a staffperson physically went to the room.

Finally, the valet service attempted to charge a 'fine' the final day (which was the price of one night's parking) because they claimed that they had not been informed of the room change, despite the fact that they managed to charge for the prior 3 days in the new room!<//review>

I stay here frequently as an airline crew member. The rooms are very nice and the restaurant and bar are great. Front desk staff is not customer service focused and they are always understaffed no matter what time of day you check in. There was a planned water outage for maintenance which they knew about several days in advance.There was no verbal notification by front desk staff, and no attempt by staff to make it right. Staff does not seem to have authority to make decisions or solve problems. Night manager, Joaquin, did not try to solve the problem and said it "was above his pay grade". He also did not inform the front desk manager, Mary, about our complaints and inconvenience.< /Review>

Rooms were dated and dirty.

Club room offered nothing worth while to platinum members. No happy hour or good food.

Local gift of a "cookie" was a joke.

Should open their breakfast earlier 0530.

Staff did not treat platinum member any different then other members.<//review>

As a preferred customer, i was asked if i wanted to upgrade to a king bed, of which i said yes. Was given my room and never told it was a handicap room, which i should have. I had a shower that didnt have a shelf for my toiletries, counter to small and had to put a towel on the floor and dump makeup items there, not given replacements by maid for lotion etc.< /Review>

The room was average; sadly, there was a problem with the toilet. A slow flush is not ever acceptable in a basic hotel room. The service did not correct the issue. I am glad the toilet did not overflow.
The parking was awful. It should have been clear at booking that there is absolutely no self-parking. I was shocked that I had to park at a lot behind the property that was accessed by coach or walking down a dimly lit street.< /Review>

Nicely renovated hotel with a 24h lounge. Lounge had snacks but ran out of water at 10pm. Rooms are clean but the two rooms I booked were somewhat loud from the airplanes. One room was upgraded to an executive suite (I am Spg platinum) which was quite large and had a dining table which was nice as we had last minute thank you cards to finish. Good thing I am not too light of a sleeper as I was able to sleep through the noise despite the sounds of the planes landing and taking off. Parking is expensive here so I parked a block away at quikpark near the Hyatt regency.

A good airport hotel which is very close to terminal 1 if you wanted to walk it. Airplane noise could be a potential problem though.</text>

If you are SPG Platinum member, this hotel really offers and looks after the members well even from the moment you are waiting for check-in. Platinum has the priority when standing in-line from Platinum only check-in stand. The service is fast and staffs are courteous full of smiles.</Text>

During the day the front desk is overstaffed, they're almost tripping over each other . And not very interested to resolve problems if you have any.

In the evening you'll be lucky if someone is behind the desk or picks up the phone.

At 260 USD / night, thats a bit steep , considering the service provided.

Rooms are clean and comfortable, only minus point would be that they're not soundproof if you have noisy neighbours ;-)< /review>

I arrived after driving for two hours wanting just a shower and a nice dinner before a quick sleep and a trip to the airport at 4:30 am. When I got to my room, It had not been cleaned from the previous resident. Trash cans full, bed unmade, dirty towels in bathroom etc. It took 45 minutes to get my room cleaned since they had sold out all of the rooms - obviously my reservation had been given away. The housekeeping staff had my room listed as occupied - but I wondered why the room still had not been cleaned.< /Review><date>1341446400000<//date>< Name>

<Review>I have had many stays at this Sheraton over the past few years and generally the accommodations were better than I found on this trip. The room was on a low floor, at the far end of the hallway and there was very loud music playing outside from a hotel event that made getting to sleep difficult. I had a very early flight in the morning an did not want to waste any sleep time changing rooms. Also as we walked to the room there was a veritable obstacle course of room service food trays on the floor.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Everything with the hotel was fine, but the parking situation was a problem and caused both frustration and delay.

I stayed for 3 nights, and was given 2 passes for parking. Twice upon using the tickets to check out of the parking lot, I was given an error by the machine. Once I was able to call via the intercom and get buzzed out, but on the final day when trying to leave for a meeting, I was told to go back inside to get a new card, only to have the front desk tell me that the card should work and that I should try it again, only for it to fail again when I went back outside. Hotel needs to find a better solution to this, like using your room key, especially when they are charging it to the hotel anyway. The hotel was fine, but based on the parking issues alone I will be staying elsewhere on my next visit to Los Angeles.</Review>< pictures>

They are super rude and unprofessional. I just needed a parking validation. My company is paying big money for the conference room and they are supposed to give a parking validation. But I'm in line and they keep ignoring me and letting people behind me check in first. What the hell?!!?!  I'm still a customer!!  Totally unprofessional.<//Review>

<text>Had to request higher floor as a gold even though it's in my reservation preferences . They were reluctant. No club access , SPG at your service questioned me why I wanted an extra sheet and set of towels when requested , airport van driver dropped me at Terminal but never got out of his seat or asked if needed help with bag and I tipped him when I got on the van.< /text>< pics>

The room smelled like hot wings..gross. Talked to Eddie again who was very put off by our not liking the smell of hot wings. Gave us a room on the preffered floor (thought we were already a member for signing up for the club) same room only cleaner. Ate a ok breakfast 4 $20 at the breakfast bar but was told it was $10. Ask for the 14th floor only and skip Eddie if u can cause he really is tired .< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Upon entering the room we were overpowered with a strong BO smell. It never really improved. The shower drain was clogged and we finished our showers in 6 inches of water. Throw in a fire alarm and multiple intercom annoncements, man what non-restfull night. Thank goodness my two kids slept through most of this disaster.< /Text>< pics>

Each time WiFi was complimentary, this time I called the desk inquiring about free wifi and I was told it was not provided. I told the person that it was always provided in the past, but he was adamant that it was not included.
I really find it outrageous that wifi is a cost item. $13 for 24 hours when the stay is less than 12 hours is unacceptable. Does Sheraton really think I need to spend that amount of money just to check my email?
You really do need to rethink this outdated policy if your want my return business.</text><user>None< /user><GmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d<//GmapID>< name>

i went to go park & sent family up to rm,

i got a call from my mom telling me this,
i called the front desk, they said come get different keys to new room, my mom went down & got new keys to rm 335 & they worked, when i got to room i called my wife at home to let her know we were in, she asked about the rm, i told her it had 2 beds but no couch, she was very upset because she had specifically talked to the man & he told her that it was a rm w/ a couch which was needed. i was traveling w/ my 90 yr old grandmother who was already in bed asleep when i got to the rm so i was not going to wake her up and move again. i can't believe it is so hard to get it right, very frustrating, 3 times is certainly not the charm & it didn't seem to matter to anyone at the front desk, but there sure wasn't any problem w/ my bill.

<text>I researched great pools and restaurants at hotels near LAX. Paparazzi at the Sheraton came up so I called to reserve a table for two to surprise my husband. 7 pm on Sunday was confirmed by hotel employee Jose. I then booked our room for our 24 hour getaway.

We arrive to be "greeted" by a very rude valet who would not let us unload the car and check in. We had to park right away and shlep our bags quite a ways. (No free parking for hotel guests. $33 + per day for valet. OUCH!)

We check in. Room was average. No fridge. Then find out Paparazzi is closed on Sundays. When I called the front desk to ask how this could be, the hotel employee offered NO sympathy. Then a manager listened but offered no help.

We went to the hotel bar for our "fine dining" experience. The staff was very inattentive. I ordered an entree salad with no tomatoes and it came overflowing with tomatoes. When I picked them off, there was barely any salad left. It was disgusting.

The next morning, we got ignored by several waiters as we tried to order breakfast. I asked for a drink menu. The waitress barely spoke English, did not know what a champagne split was.

Long story short, the staff was rude and didn't seem to care about making our experience extraordinary in the least. We won't return.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

The good part is the hotel is very close to LAX airport, and surely you can enjoy a sweet sleep there. However the lounge is poor, almost nothing to serve. As a SPG100 Platinum member, my room didn't get upgraded, it was a little bit disapointing.<//text>

<text>The hotel has clean rooms and good location right at the airport. Down sides are forget walking to get anything to eat unless you like subway every night. The food at the restaurant / bar inside the hotel was not that good. Wireless internet was very slow to the point of being unusable. I asked the staff to give me a hard copy of my bill under my door and instead they emailed it to me.< /text><Pics>None</Pics></record>

I've used this hotel on numerous occasions over many years whenever I need to stay in the LAX airport area and it can't be beat. The location is fantastic, the rooms are always first class, and the staff is attentive. This stay was no exception.<//text>

<review>The convenience of this hotel is the proximity to the airport and also just two blocks from Hertz car rentals. I recommend this hotel but if you are looking for a better SPG one then stay at the Westin LAX.<//review>< Pictures>

I will start by saying that we will Not be returning to this location. We have stayed here for the last 5 years each year getting worst but out last visit was the worst.
We like this Sheraton because they offer the free shuttle to LAX, very convenient. But other hotels around offer the same service.
We arrived on Wednesday night to check in, our reservation a King Size Bedroom. The person at desk told us that the hotel was at full capacity and that we get 2 queen size beds. Already a bad start. I don't get why you have to make a reservation if when you show up they no longer have a room that fits your needs. A queen size bed for a person who is 6'4 means to sleep curled all night long if you stretch your legs will hang from this bed. We walk in the room, Room smells like smoke (it's a non smoking room) The room next to us, whoever was staying there was smoking weed you could smell it when we walked by.
They charge: $12.95 for 24 hours of basic internet.
Room service food not impressed for the prices. Paid $15 for a waffle. They charge $4.00 for delivery and a 16% charge ( you still have an option for additional tip )
I never mind the prices for room service and specially a place by the airport it's expected to be on the pricey side but the food is lacking so many things.

The outside of the hotel is trashed. When we walked in by the side there was empty bottles of vodka and tequila and plastic cups.

We have been part of the Sheraton point system since 2009 we have never gotten anything out of it.
I am very disappointed that big businesses like Sheraton try to give you crumbs for  what you pay for. Other businesses will try to give you at least a muffin or something so small to show that they care. Don't expect it from Sheraton.

I'm giving Sheraton LAX a one start only because the service people are nice.<//text>

My phone was broken and I missed a wake-up call (when I complained about this I was told that phone had rung and that someone had come to the door. I am a light sleeper and don't believe this was accurate). After missing two messages from my husband, I complined and was told that someone would come to my room. No one came. Then the next day I again missed two messages from my husband; when I complained staff came to my room and I was told that the phone line was not working . Each night I had to request a wake-up call on the second line. I addition, the bathtub did not drain and the toilet seat was broken. The food choices were OK, yet limited; despite the room service charges on the bill, the waiter who delivered the food, told me that I needed to fill out the tip. I told him "no" as it was on the statement. He looked at it and pretended that he didn't know.<//review>

This hotel is handy for its proximity to the airport and ease of transport to Santa Monica Pier, Venice Beach and surrounds, on the metro. More complicated location if one wants to go to Downtown LA without a tour company.
Room was average and smoke smelly - which was addressed promptly and the room was appropriate for the price paid.<//Text>

<review>I booked the room at the last minute and I encountered a couple of inconveniences. When I first arrived there was no area to park unless you wanted to valet. There was not even an option to park temporarily to check in and figure out what options were available. I parked across the street in the banks parking structure. During the process of checking in I asked about parking options. The options were valet, I believe was $35 or using a parking lot that was used for airport travelers that was a little more then a block away. There was a voucher pass that was explained to me in the most confusing way that I ended up returning. I ended up using the airport parking and still had to pay to get out of the parking structure that I parked in to check in.

After parking and walking back with my luggage to the hotel, I went to my room. King sized bed, tv, ect.. The room was really nice. The bed on the other hand was uncomfortable and I found it difficult to sleep on. I am not a picky sleeper so for me to be uncomfortable there had to be an issue.

The bar was nice, reasonably priced drinks and the food was good.

Overall I dont think that I would stay at this location again, mainly the parking issue was the biggest factor and the most inconvenient.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>The hotel has great lobby, restaurants and location. The room was horrible. The chair was broken and stained, the window was very dirty (never saw so dirty window), bathroom sink backs up overnight for some reason and needs unclogging in the morning. As usual, you have to pay separately for just about everything, the paid parking lot is across the street behind the hotel (does not even belong to the hotel). The cost of stay comes to about $250 per day and it is not worth it, not even closely.<//text>< pics>

<Text>The hotel was overall ok, the room was clean and the places to eat in the hotel were good.

The glitch came on checkout day. We had our room until 12pm, we went back to it around 11am, and found we had been checked out and our room given to someone else.

The staff was very apologetic and assigned a new room and gave us a late checkout time free of charge.</Text><Name>Ashlan<//Name>< GmapID>

I stayed 4 nights here due to a convention I was attending nearby. This Sheraton doesn't offer the standard SPG basic membership things like free water bottles. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, which is convenient, since the LAX area is pretty barren. Staff was helpful/nice. Only a few things bothered me;

- My shower/tub was clogged
- My toilet was constantly running
- The connector door in my room was weird and was a weak point for noise. I shoved a towel in the gap of the door so I wouldn't hear everything my neighbor was doing
- (This last point is NO fault of the Sheraton's, just the area) There is no food nearby! Other than fast food and hotel food (which we all know is I overpriced for the quality)

Overall, not bad. The $14 wifi is a little silly though.</Review>

<Text>I made a long trip from South America to Singapore. The hotel is well placed, near the aiport, for a night stop. It has all the amenities I like, and I was treated accordingly to my SPG status. Met my expectations, and price was OK for me.< /Text>< GmapID>

<text>We stayed here because we had an early morning flight, and they offer a free shuttle to the airport, which runs every 15 minutes. We turned in our car the night before to make the morning less stressful, and to avoid the ridiculous valet parking fee. Value for price was acceptable, but we do have a few negative comments. First, we made our reservation through the 800# and our rate included free WiFi. This was confirmed as we checked in. However, when we checked out, we had been charged $12.95, which we had some pushback getting them to fix. Second, there are soda machines but no snack machines anywhere on the property. Third, we went to the bar to have a drink. Ordered two Gin and Tonics and two Draft Beers. The bill came and it was $35! WOW! Finally, there is nowhere to park your car while you check in if you are leaving immediately or turning in a rental car. The valet insisted on taking our keys, even though we were only going to be inside for 5 minutes. After checking in, we came out and it took them 5 minutes to find our keys. There needs to be a lane or a few parking spaces that can be used for this purpose. Overall however, would choose again.< /text>< Time>

Not a pleasant experience especially the catering carts were rolling out from the kitchen early in the morning. The noise was even louder than the airplanes. Although the tobacco smell was gone in the third day, we are very surprised Sheraton will offer the room to a SPG member.<//review>< name>

<Text>Although the lobby and bar area are attractive, the rest of the hotel just did not measure up. The room was simply average. And making it unsat was the fact that the shower did not drain properly. Towards the end of one's shower there is a 4 inch deep pool of dirty water in the tub. Prices are much too high for this average quality hotel: A cosmopolitan cocktail in the bar for the ladies is $14! That's more expensive than NYC. And the $24 nacho plate used that cheap unnatural-looking velveeta type cheese. Seems a little chintzy.< /Text>< pics>

Front desk service very accommodating, allowed me to check in early. Room was mostly nice, although there was a very questionable stain on one of the chairs.  The pen that came with the room was also broken -- it was surprising to me that something this simple could be overlooked.  Outdoor pool is nice and thankfully heated.< /Text>

I could not believe that this hotel has a priority check in sign for Gold and Platinum Members, but in practice, it is not working the way supposed to be. I was waiting for more than 8 minutes, and all other guests behind me got checked in at regular line but I was still waiting for someone to help. I wonder why should have the priority check in sign for Gold and Platinum Members but it is not working at all in this hotel? It is meaningless to have sign there.<//Review>

<review>I am a big starwood fan and was a little disappointed with my stay. I used my starwood points to book a night and that was an absolute waste. This was the first leg of my husbands and I honeymoon 2 days in LA - 6 days in Fiji then back to La. Clearly when we return to LA we wont be staying here. The room (Bathroom) was dirty upon our arrival, red stains in the sink , yellow stains on the towels, aweful water pressure for the shower. We later ordered room service which arrived COLD. Also when I checked in I informed then it was a part of our honeymoon and requested the club lounge floor, I was denied that request even as a spg member because I didnt select the upgrade online. I later asked if we could at least lounge in the club lounge until our flight left and the answer was no the manager would not even come out to acknowledge me. I will say the highlight was the restaurant our waiter was amazing and the food was pretty good, they even found margarine for my toast because I had a dairy allergy. One of the managers did comp my room service, but overall I will clearly be finding somewhere else to stay where rooms are clean and spg members are valued when I return from fiji.< /review>< Name>

On my stay I expected to feel more comfortable to use all features the facility offered, however the pool was not 24hrs as they said at first when I checked in and there indoor restaurant closed way too early as well as there bar. After a long flight I was hopeing to be able to stay at the room and have full accommodations very disappointed with this facility.< /Review>

Checked in for a three-night stay & the front desk personnel were very courteous & professional. The facilities was very inviting especially the pool area. The room was great & we were able to control the temperature which is important. Throughout our stay 1) the card key did not work which is an inconvenience because I keep on asking the front desk to replace my card key & the issue was never resolved the whole time we we there although we were given some SPG points back; 2) the ice machine on our floor or the floor below us did not work for two days; 3) parking is offsite and could be an inconvenience for guests who do not wish to valet park. When I registered into the hotel there was no parking available & the shuttle bust drivers were very rude to my wife who waited in the standing car while I checked-in. Also if the parking lot charges $11 for 24 hours Sheraton charges $17/day, if the hotel doesn't own the lot would have been nice to get a discount. Also the bar munchies were stale, I could have spent more money. Overall our stay could have been better if the issues I brought up were addressed, I doubt I will stay here again.<//text>

I've been staying at this hotel since 2006 and I must say that It has come a long way in improvements and needs of customers.

The staff at this location is what makes this hotel so great and it is one of the reasons that I only give it my business when I travel to LAX.

I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants R&R.<//text>

Parking is horrible! It rained while we were there. It was a walk to get to hotel. Beds & bathroom were clean, but not the most comfortable bed. We were spoiled at the London the first couple of nights we stayed in LA. Meh.</Review>

Shower head broken, given handicapped accessable room with wooden seat in tub when we did not request such room. Staff seemed quite aloof and not interested in a couple of vacationers passing through who would not be roaming the halls drunk and making noise at 3 in the morning like the folks using the ice machine next to our room. Room was prepaid, yet was charged 43.95 when all I had charged was the internet service, Horrible exprience. Would have been better served at a low end chain.</Review>

From Mary, the manager, on the phone when I called ahead, the Gregory, at the front desk when I checked in, to Jorge, the bellman, to Julie and Diane, in Guest Services, our arrival could not have gone more smoothly. As an individual who has traveled more than 3000 nights in my career, I rarely have such unmitigated praise. Bravo!<//Review>

Due to negative reviews I was hesitant to book this stay. I must say I was extremely pleased!! The hotel was clean , well appointed and the staff were both attentive and extremely friendly . The parking is a bit expensive and challenging if you don't valet but overall this hotel is highly recommended .< /Review>

Had a horrible experience with the hotel valet when they parked another car in front of ours on purpose. When we confronted them, they said they did it because we stayed parked there too long. LIttle did they know we had a 2 year old with the stomach flu that we were trying to rush up to our room and get settled. The front desk person didn't even look me in the eye or care about our situation at all.
Room service staff was delightful, but the food was cold, dry and average. The first morning we had a beautiful fruit plate delivered and the next morning we ordered the same thing and got a bowl of chunked fruit. Manager of the hotel didn't seem to care and offered us a "free movie" to make up for all of our troubles.</Review>

At time of check in i was told everything was set they just needed a debit card to hold a $75 deposit so they did it then the next morning i call my card balance to find out that Sheraton gateway had pulled $217.40 from my account. When i called them they said they made a mistake and they would refund the card on Monday so It's now monday and my bank says they have not even released the money and the hotel says they have now we are going through a despute with the hotel so we can get it settled because they refuse to let the money go. On top of it all when we got to the rooms there was no refrigerator or microwave just disgusting coffee and overpriced water bottles. Hands down worst hotel ever if you stay here be aware<//review>< pics>

<Name>PassiveSmoker<//Name><review>I thought that booking a non-smoking room in a 4-star hotel would allow me to rest before a long air travel. I was completely wrong. The moment I entered my room, I felt a smell. I was so tired that I wanted to shower and get in bed. It want until 2 am that I called the front desk to ask why do I still breathe cigarette smoke. They said that they would check and find out. Needless to say that nothing changed. I am sensitive to smoke. I had a stuffy nose until I left the room in the morning. I could hardly sleep 2 or 3 hours before my almost 24 hour travel. When I mentioned this at the front desk, all I got is that they will relay this to their manager. I waited to see if they would reach me with an explanation or an attempt to make up for this horrible experience. Nothing. I am sure I will get a response below saying "We are sorry for your experience and we would hope you would allow us to make your experience much more pleasant in the future". i am sorry but you will not have that chance and I urge anyone reading this to strongly reconsider, if you are looking for a smoke-free place to sleep.<//review>< Pics>

We have been staying at the Sheraton Gateway LAX hotel for many years, every time we go to LA.
We like staying there because the hotel is always well kept, the proximity to the airport is very convenient because we normally arrive after a long flight and depart to another destination to come back again< /review>

Sadly stayed only for one night, just to transit for my next flight, but during that time, hotel accommodations were very good, a nice room for the guests, I've tried the restaurant named Costero, the tast was Ok and a bit overpriced. Attention of both (Hotel and restaurant) was exceptional my only complain is that the Airplane noise taking off that can be heared clearly, hotel is beside the airport but you can do best to reduce outside noise. I would come back, definitely!!!!! I recommend this hotel.</Text>

<review>The manager was very apologetic when his staff hung up on me multiple times when I called the front desk for help. Very frustrating. Then I buy a daily parking pass for 17 dollars before I am ready to use it because the guy at the front desk told me its starts from the moment I use the card not purchase it. Not true. Started from the time of purchase so not only did i pay the front desk 17 dollars I also had to repay the parking garage since my ticket expired .< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d< /gmapID></record>

<text>Hotel was clean, and very quiet for being next to the airport. However, very disappointed that as a Platinum guest I was put in a room next to the elevator and ice machine and was kept up all night. On top of that, it was a handicap accessible room and had no bathroom counter, had to place my toiletres on the floor the whole stay.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Over the weekend of my stay, the hotel experienced a water outage for an entire day. Though inconvenient, I was pleasantly surprised by the quick reaction of the hotel staff. From my perspective, they did all they could do to make the unfortunate situation more bearable, while repairs were being made.< /Review>

I came to the Sheraton Gateway LAX to plan a large event as they have significant exposition space and relatively low room rates. This property was recommended to me by my travel agency as it has been updated recently by the guy who did the SLS Hotel on La Cienega in West Hollywood.

I confirmed that my dates were open and met with the entry level salesperson as the hotel had what I needed for my group which would have taken over most of their conference space and upwards of 300 rooms over a few days. This was a Monday and I was promised a bid by the next day - Tuesday. By Wends - I had to call to check on the bid with no answer. I heard nothing again until Friday when I was assured a bid was coming. It never came.

I called the property's General Manager, Michael Washington, and then heard from the Director of Sales who brought in the A-Team for a meeting. She confirmed dates, consulted with the security people on issues about the show, talked about how to show cars (part of my show) and showed me the inventory at the show. She sent me a bid complete with spelling errors and missing details. It was very much of "what we can't do for you". I asked to go over this with her on a phone meeting 1.5 weeks in and an 11:30 Wednesday meeting was set. I called the number at 11:30 and no answer. I sent an email. I heard nothing from the Director of Sales until I called her again at 3:30 that day. She starts in with the what we can't do for you and her favorite line "Let me be honest with you" which she stated easily 10x in the call. If she's being honest with me at that point does this mean she's lying the other times? Stay tuned... the story only gets better.

Remember the GM? He never returned my 2 phone calls. Friday at 4:30 I hear from him with the Director of Sales on the phone to say "we are renovating our space and can't accommodate your event". Really? You made that decision in the two weeks since I reached out to you? No you didn't. You just wasted 2 weeks of time working with your hotel.

If you are planning to host an event and want professional service - RUN don't walk from the Sheraton Gateway LAX. My father always used to say in companies "the fish stinks from the head down" and you can see what you get from the Sheraton Gateway LAX. Lies, misinformation, bait-and-switch pricing (the first salesman offered me a group rate $20 less than what the director of sales offered" and more.

Buyer beware.<//review>

<Review>I have to be totally honest with you and tell you that as a Platinum Member with over 60 nights stayed year to date with Starwood Properties, I was insulted that I had to use points to pay for this stay. I surprised my 8yr old for her birthday and took here to LA and wanted to stay near the airport so we would not have to fight LA traffice the morning we left. HUGE MISTAKE! Not ONE thing went well at this hotel and I feel cheated. I waited to cool down after the trip and decided to still write this review a week later. I guess service wasn't very important to the staff there Labor Weekend or they were pre-occupied by the number of guests there but I'm not sure I would ever stay there again even if it were free. #customerservicematters</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Lots of construction going on. We booked a club level room, but they said that level was closed and put us on another floor with a makeshift lounge, then later I was on the elevator with guests who were going to the actual club floor. Staff in lounge were dreadful. I couldn't get a Diet Coke to take to my room and had to wait for 10-15 minutes while the attendant went somewhere to get a very small glass of wine. The room was dark and dingy with tears in the upholstery and it smelled funny. Overall, it was the worst SPG property I've ever stayed at.< /Text>

When I arrived on July 13, after unpacking I sat to relax for a few moments to watch TV but found it not working. After crawling around to seeing if I could find connection problems (unsuccessfully), I decided to call the desk or housekeeping to report the problem. The phone was also not working! By them I had to depart for an appointment and reported the problems to the front desk. By the time I returned late that evening, the problems had been solved. The next morning, I went down to the hotel exercise facility (it is great!) and after the workout I found that my room key would not permit access to the 15th floor (my room was 1566). I went to the desk and was told that the magnetic striip was the likely problem and a new key was made. HOWEVER, since I did not take ID with me to the gym, I had to wait for security reasons to be escorted to my room. The desk clerk called for assistance and I/we waited a full ten minutes or more before someone finally responded. Once we got to the room, he just opened the door and let me in without any check of credentials so I don't see the point of a security escort. The upshot was that I was late for my first appointment that morning. This was unusual because I've always been very satisified with my Starwood experiences, but this was definitely a disappointment.<//text>

<Text>I love to have a drink or two but was astonished to learn that you allow patrons to walk around the lobby and use the elevators with drinks in their hands. My wife and I checked in as we have in the past, got on the elevator and were joined by an intoxicated man with a full beer in his hand which he proceeded to spill on my wife's jacket. No apology and when she complained he called her a b---ch. i followed him to his room 15th floor and reported it to security; they said nothing could be done because there is no policy against drinking and roaming around the building. Won't stay there again if this policy stays in effect.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>It was a mixed experience. The first room they gave us had a real bad smoky smell to it. So we requsted another room. It was almost 11 pm and we had to take all 6 of our heavy luggage to the 7th floor. The person at the reception himself came to show us the new room and helped us with one of our luggage. He saidhe was sorry and promised breakfast delivered to our room the next morning as a courtesy. Next morning no breakfast. so we went about our business. Next day morning, i called front desk and explained that we were promised a complementary breakfast. She forwarded call to manager. I left a message but no one called after 1 hr. so i called again and finally got manager. He said he will see what he can do. A few minutes later a bell boy showed up with 4 breakfast vouchers. So eventhough breakfast was not delivered to our room, we enjoyed a fantastic breakfast buffet using the vouchers. No complaints about the second room. A bit less spacious. But it was clean and quite. we had two good nights sleep. I would have given them 5 stars if they got everything right the first time or second time. We would go there again.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Walked in the room and the bed looks like someone used the bed; open bar of soap in soap dish; tub don't drain; shower head was loose and spraying at hose connection; coffee maker was filled with water - who knows how long it's been in there; floor was dirty; no spare toilet paper - just had enough for 2 uses; trash can had used and stained tissue and toilet paper - use your imagination what the stains were.

I"ve stayed here twice. First time I was unhappy - the room was untidy. I gave it another chance. Maybe it was just an anomaly. It was worst the second time. See above. I'll never return to this hotel again.<//review>

The room on the 15th floor was fabulous and the Club lounge was perfect. This stay was a stopover on the way home from Russia and it allowed us to "catch our breath" before the last leg home to Hawaii.</Text>

When I booked the room, I specifically told the representative that I will be checking in at about 12:30am because that was when I arrived and I was ensured that should not be a problem.
Upon arrival to the hotel, I was not allowed to check in unless I pay for another night which is absolutely unacceptable because why should I be responsible when your staff gave me the wrong information.
The staff are not helpful at all and the bathtub was clogged.< /text>

Receptionist was unfriendly and non cooperative and unwilling to listen . We stayed three night one night of which our room was not cleaned. We had a visit and the hotel was using the handy cap parking locations for Valet parking and were charged $30 for a short time time valet parking. Very dry and unwelcome staff. Also, recently I stayed at your facility in puerto Vallarta ,Mexico and had a similar experience with the service.<//review>< pics>

We arrived late at night and as such, did not have much time to check out the hotel and its services however the car valet services did stand out both in the execution of the services as well as the overall deportment of the valets. I have never seen car jockeys wearing business suits and fedoras and first wasn't sure who they were, only clueing in when I noticed that they were all wearing identical suits and hats and rushing around opening car doors and quickly moving cars in and out.</Text>

<review>I love the physical plant of this hotel, the well designed rooms, friendly and competent housekeepers and well maintained facilities. I hate the unprofessional, unpleasant front desk. I was the first person in the Gold/Platinum check in line and still waited twenty minutes while three different attendants plus a manager futzed with others (nonexistent) reservations. I finally had to raise my voice to get some service. I finally had my keys tossed at me and was "dismissed". Not a way to treat your best customers. I would go back only because it is nonetheless the best of all airport hotels at LAX.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Staff was rude (everyone we ran in to), under trained and generally arrogant. Tasmania the front desk supervisor is too busy managing ineffective staff that I guess she has no choice but to be rude to guests. Rooms are old and haven't been remodeled since the 80's. Hot tub was filthy. Lobby bar charges $5 for a cup of regular coffee. Club room on 15th floor had awful breakfast selection and closed too early. Do not stay here.<//text>

<review>As a platinum spg member I expected a decent functional room. My room had only one desk outlet and we needed several. The Westin we stayed in last night had outlets on every lamp base and a power strip on the desk. The bath door would not shut properly and the toilet bowl is a few inches shy from the door making it a tight bathroom. The bathroom also smelled like a sewer as if it wasn't vented or didn't have a p - trap. The beds were not great either. The first A.M. shuttle to the airport was a bit late. They sent one shuttle when clearly they needed two shuttles to help the line of people who needed to catch early flights out of LAX Wednesday morning. The shuttles were small vans. There were taxi drivers soliciting passengers offering ten dollar rides to the airport as we were all standing outside waiting for the shuttle. Meanwhile there was a larger shuttle which was waiting for hotel corporate only passengers - which could have given all of us a ride - it had zero passengers. Hello, where is the customer service manager ?<//review><time>1405400948133< /time><UserId.>116925486178419395798<//UserId.>< GmapID>

While I stay at this hotel a lot and am a platinum elite member, this say was problematic. I was to stay 4 nights starting 1.28.13 yet my plans changed such that i had to check out Wednesday morning 1.30.13. My reservation was on flexible rate basis.
However I was and have been billed for all four nights and depsite repeated attempts to get this corrected we can not get a real person to call and fix it.<//Review>

Check out line was really long and management did a bad job of recognizing the problem and correcting. When I raised issues, staff was defensive and not appreciative of customer service issues. I also had problems with valet staff. Restaurant staff was great but front desk staff was generally very mediocre and appeared poorly trained.< /text>

The shower drain was VERY slow along with tattered old towels in the bathroom. The food service at the bar was slow, the pool area was not neat.

It should not take over 30 minutes just to check into a hotel, especially when you are a corporate member. This wasn't just a one night problem; the line was crazy the second night I was there too.</Text>

<text>Have been very satisfied staying with Starwood hotels, but can't stand the points program. They choose to penalize me for booking through Expedia. Guess I would rather book through Expedia than get SPG recognition, but it doesn't make me any less bitter...< /text>< pics>

<date>1394409600000</date><text>The bathtub had soil type soot in it when we checked in and each morning (plumbing issue). It was disgusting. I mentioned it to the front desk staff when I checked out, but he didn't make a note of it. I mentioned it because hotels should rely on the comments from their guests and I don't feel like my comment was even recognized. It is not my room, nor my pipes, so it although it was a problem during my staff, eventually it will be your problem, I suppose.< /text><user>None</user></record></dataset><record>

<review>very rude room service. I did not have any towels (except two small ones to dry hands and face) in my room. I called the room service. He was very rude. He did not deliver for ~ 15 mins. I had to dress up and go downstairs to request it personally.
Parking is a disaster. You pay ~ 17 dollars to park in a distant parking lot. It is a good 10-15 mins walk one-way. The only other option is valet parking. It costs 46 dollars.
No internet. You need to pay for it.
Rooms don't have refrigerators and quite small for a king-size bedroom.</review><Time>1496905283478< /Time>< rating>

<Text>To many noise at midnight, around 12:00 AM started to open and close the doors and to many noise in the hall, I call to the front desk and after 10 minutes was ringing the telephone they answer me and I reported the success and they answer to me IM SORRY, but they do not do anything until about 1:30 AM, I call several times but never answer me again the telephone.
Then around 8:30 AM Im went down to the front desk and I request to call with a manager but nobody call him and the only answer was WE SORRY, and after I was insisted with my complaint arrives the security personal to take me out, but in the NIGTH TIME NOBODY DO ANYTHING for that nooises.
After in the night IM REQUEST TO GIVE ME THE TELEPHONE OF THE SPG INTERNATIONAL TO PUT MY CLAIM, and ride a way answer me a manager and try to deal with me. But the deal do not give us back our rest.
I'm think about the noises was like a bad girls, and maybe the night personal was involved.
That was the reason they do not do anything and do not want to answer the telephones.< /Text>< username>

I would recommend the other two SPG properties by LAX,  but not this one.
The front desk took way too long , in spite of the fact that my partner is a Platinum SPG Member.  And Security was resentful the entire time .</text>< user_id>

I decided to stay at the Gateway Sheraton because a conference I was attending was here at a special discounted price. I will NEVER stay at one again.

The customer service was terrible. I don't mean bad and needs work, but terrible. I have never been treated like this before.

As I walked in, I was greeted by a man to check in. At first he was nice but was coughing ALL over the desk and not covering his mouth.. gross. Then I went to pay on debit since I wasnt traveling with my credit card and read in my email that I could do debit. He had no idea how to process this so he told me I could charge a credit card from someone who wasnt staying here as long as I got there email. I decided to give them my boyfriends email and started spelling it out for him. He immediately got VERY rude and said “I ASKED for you to WRITE it down!” so I asked for a pen and he just threw it on the counter. Not impressed and completely taken off guard. I then called my boyfriend to transfer him my room cost so he could pay it on his card. The front desk emailed him the proper forms and told me to go sit and wait because he had to deal with “real customers.” I felt very talked down to because I wasn't wearing a suit like the men behind me and he said I wasnt a “real customer” .. What does that even mean? Because I hadnt paid yet? My boyfriend then didnt understand some of the information being asked so I asked if someone could call him and explain it. The man then went to tell his supervisor to ask her to call. 20 minutes later she finally called and walked him through the form. My boyfriend told me it was all good to go. I sat there on the couches for another 30 minutes waiting for someone to grab me to check me in (meanwhile no other customers were at the counter) and finally I went up and asked if the form was complete. The manager rudely told the man that she had printed it off (like he was supposed to just know). The man proceeded to get the sheet and put the information into the computer. He then charged me an extra night which I caught right away and he didnt actually believe I paid when I booked online. Then checked and realized I did and mumbled some stuff under his breath. He then asked how I was paying for the $75 incidentals and I said with the credit card. (since I only had debit) and he said that couldnt be done. I then spoke up and said “You KNEW I only had debit! Theres nothing I can do about this because you didnt charge the card!” (which I admit shouldnt have done but I was getting very frustrated after all of this. He then told me there was an ATM which he decided not to let me know before I went through all the credit card hassle. I went and took out $80 for him. I then asked to speak to his manager (not knowing it was that rude lady from before). She came up to me and I expressed my disappointment in their quality of service and she quickly defended herself by saying “Well I have other things to take care of too.” Which I totally understand but you would rather help a guest who JUST walked up to the counter before you help the one who has been waiting over an hour to get checked in. Just terrible. She apologized insincerely so I just left it and went to my room. I then got into my room and realized I had no wifi so I called down and asked if it was complimentary. Apparently I have to pay $12 a day to get wifi where in my email says “Sweet Sleeper Bed, 32 Inch Flat Panel LCD TV, Wi-Fi Internet..” So I asked why it said that in there and she said “Just so youre aware of the service we provide. It is extra money though” So my question is, do you charge extra for your beds? Or Tvs? Why put it in there and charge extra. Just completely taken back. I then went and sat downstairs in the Lobby for 2 hours to work on the wifi and decided to just go up and pay the $12. So I asked to pay for wifi and the guy at the desk informed me that it was complementary and he just had to refresh it but it should be working now. Such an inconvenience after I even called. Poor poor service. Everything was just going wrong and VERY unimpressed. I have 40 of my clients coming down for this event and I will make sure to tell them all my experience and I know I will not recommend this hotel or stay here ever again. Even if it were free. Customer service is number one and this hotel has none of it, as far as I can tell.<//text>

They overbooked the night I was supposed to stay but they set me up with another hotel down the street. I was pretty upset they didn't have a room for me even though I had a reservation, but they did handle the situation well so they get some point back for that.<//text>

<text>I was disappointed that the room did not have a refrigerator or an exhaust fan in the bathroom. The Concierge desk was often unattended. $30 per night for valet parking. Wireless Internet was so slow that it was often unusable and when the front desk was ask about it when checking out admitted that it was a known problem. Then why charge at all??? For a Sheraton it was pretty disappointing<//text><user_id>None</user_id><pics>None</pics></record>

<text>Chose to stay in the hotel since we had an overnight layover on a flight back from Asia. Excellent location, very close to airport; lobby area, sheraton link area and lounge area stylish & welcoming; pool area & cabanas pleasant and a nice feature.

<Text>I recently visited the Sheraton Gateway LAX for a whirlwind 18 hour trip to LA. Upon arriving to the property, I was promptly greeted by a very cordial valet. In fact, every time I pulled up, the valets were so friendly and an ideal first impression of the hotel. The front desk was slow. Both agents I encountered were very friendly, but didn't move with any sort of urgency, instead demonstrating uncertainty. When I took a shower in the morning, the tub was very slow draining and in my brief shower, about an inch and a half of standing water accumulated. I mentioned this to the front desk when checking out, so another guest did not have the same experience and was apologized to and offered a meager apology with some SPG points. All in all, the staff was friendly and wanted to make sure I had a good time, but recovery and urgency was lacking at the front desk.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

No one cleaned my room for 3 nights and I called several times and they couldn't figure out why my room wasn't clean after house keeping confirmed what time to arrive over 2 out of the 3 days. They over charged my credit card and I'm totally unhappy as a spg member. No one has returned my call yet and I left several messages with a supervisor!<//review>

<time>1369008000000<//time><Review>The carpeting in the hallway, at least on the 3rd floor, looked pretty old. The hallway carpet, at least on the 3rd floor, looked like it needs to be cleaned; dingy and dirty. In my opinion, the breakfast buffet was over priced.

After I checked in, I decided I would go to the lobby lounge/bar to have a meal and drink a beer or two. The lounge did not appear as though it was busy; lots of staff and approximately 10-15 customers. However, it took approximately 15 minutes before the waiter approached the table I was seated. After ordering, 1 beer and a meal. The waiter promptly returned with my beer and a small container of snacks and he left. It took me approximately 20 minutes to consume the contents of the small snack container and half of the beer I ordered. Since placing my initial order with my waiter, he was nowhere to be seen. The number of customers present at the lounge increased to approximately 20-25 people. Since I had not yet received the meal I ordered, had an empty snack container and half a beer, I decided I would like another container of snacks to consume with the beer. Since my waiter was nowhere to be seen and since my table was in close proximity to the bar (approximately 7 feet,) I made eye contact with a bartender, held up my empty snack container, requested more snacks, and began to watch a televised sport event. After approximately 7 minutes, I noticed, not one had responded to my table to provide me with another snack container. I made eye contact with the same bartender that I previously requested more snacks from and requested an update on the snack refill I initially requested. The bartender then pointed to a small snack container on the bar near another customer, abruptly returned to his duties of tending bar, and made no further eye contact with me. From his nonverbal cues, I surmised he expected me to leave the table I was seated at to retrieve the snack container I requested.

My waiter whom I initially placed my order with returned to my table with the meal I ordered; approximately 10 minutes after I retrieved the second snack container from the bar. Approximately 55 minutes lapsed between the time I entered the lounge, ordered and received my meal. After my waiter presented my meal, he disappeared again. I finished eating my meal within approximately 15 minutes. During this time, my waiter never returned to my table. The only other time he did return, was at the time, I noted he was walking up to the bar. I then flagged him down, and upon his arrival at my table I requested the check, which he provided within 7 minutes, approximately. Upon paying my bill, I concluded I would never return to that lounge again. The lack of customer service I experienced was unacceptable; that's an understatement.< /Review>< user>

we were with 6 persons and i made the reservation through the Lax booking service, which i thought the hotel supported.
when we arrived they told us we could not get sheraton points.The rate we paid saved us about $10/pp.You were supposed to match it and we were to get our points.
what can you do to rectify the situation?< /review>

I checked in this hotel at about 10pm after driving from Las Vegas. When I got to the room I smelled a mildew smell and was turned off. Then to discover the shower wouldn't drain. I called front desk asking for another room but I was told they were negative for the night. I then asked for my money back which they said they couldn't do. I was so unhappy I packed up and checked out. I went down stairs and all of a sudden they had another room avalible but it was too late by then. I was told I was going to get a credit to my account for the inconvience and that was thursaday. Today is wed. and still nothing. I will now be calling my credit card company. Not to mention I paid for parking for an hour!< /text>

The most ever worst experiences with Sheraton! We booked it from Expedia. They give us the top floor facing the airport. It is very noisy inside the room. You can hear the huge noise made by the landing planes every a few minutes. Yes, LAX is a quite busy airport. It feels like you are beside a giant motor engine. The water runs really slowly in the shower that I can hardly wash my hair.
The reception is neither nice nor patient. I asked them if we could change the room for the following couple of days, they were very reluctant to answer me and the answer was to check later. No breakfast, no free wifi. $12 per day for wifi.
No free parking. There is a very expensive public parking behind Sheraton and you can get one day ticket from the hotel, charging you $17. It is quite annoying that we don't know it when we first checked in and later came to know it from the managing people in parking lot. The 1st day ticket got invalid within 24 hours and the reception was very rude when I consulted them about it.
The room is very small, less of equipment, even without electronic boiler to get hot water! The TV channels are also quite limited with very few. I can't imagine this is a famous hotel.
I would not recommend Sheraton for travelers.
I personally will never choose Sheraton.</text>

When I checked into my room it was not ready for guest. Spoke with housekeeper on floor, and front desk. When I checked out nothing had been corrected. I will never stay in this hotel again. Thinking about disputing the charge with American Express. Called to speak to Hotel Manager, put on hold and disconnected twice.<//review>

Great for layovers or early flights.  Mediocre service includes lousy $6 lattes from a crap machine in the restaurant. Pick this place only when the rate is good.<//Text>

Really comfortable rooms, but parking is $17-$48, and WiFi is $12, so they really go for the extras here. Drop your rental first if you're staying here!</Text>

I was about 3 doors down from the elevator bank and could hear what sounded like people talking loudly right outside my door. I opened the door and stepped out to check it out and ask them to please lower their voices since it was 4am. I found out they were at the elevator bank at least 40 feet away from my door and around the corner. My preferences list that I would like a room away from the elevator due to the normal dinging and noises associated with an elevator. I didn't think those would be a problem 40 feet away.

I contacted the hotel and was hung up on the first time I tried to speak to the front desk. The second call I talked to the operator and she said a manager would get ahold of me that day. By 8pm I still hadn't heard from anyone so i called back and they offered 2000 points. I asked if that was what a good night's sleep was worth (not even half of the points it would take to stay at that hotel). I asked if that was the best they could do to keep my business and the lady responded that was it. I said to keep the 2000 points, I just won't be staying at their hotel any longer. There are other SPG hotels in the area, pick one of those.

Also still waiting on my digital receipt.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

In the last six months I have stayed at this hotel three times and there is always some sort of renovations. It's getting boring. Now the bar/restaurant area is being renovated. Very inconvenient and the prices are still high.< /Text>

< Review>
I wrote on the Starwood survey how bad this hotel was and in short this is what I listed. I usually get a response from the hotel but they never responded to my comment. So for you Starwood members; Do not stay here: poor staff: rude and poor attitude. Worst parking: Get ready to walk far as they provide LAWA over 100 stalls, and dirty bed sheets: check the sheets before you sleep on them.< /Review>

<review>This hotel does not maintain SPG standards. The room smelled like body odor and the only reason I did not complain while I was there because I was so busy with work, I had no time. In addition, the remote buttons for the TV were stuck and the sink did not drain, and would bubble up on its own. The body odor was the most offensive issue however. Staff very friendly however.</review><rate>None<//rate>< user>

<Name>Owen11</Name><time>1404345600000</time><Rating>None< /Rating><review>I have stayed at the Sheraton Gateway on many of my trips to LAX, I stayed on two occasions this June..As usual your service standards, from front desk check in to checkout were of the highest order, I felt that most facets of my experience at The Gateway hotel were very good, but I feel I must point out to you and management of an area that is starting to deteriorate, and that is the club longe experience..on both occasions during my stays in June there seemed to be little or no attention being paid by your staff to dress standards, or codes of dress adopted by some of the guests.. In particular the appropriate shoe code that management has seen fit to post a sign at the entrance to the lounge..It is quite clearly displayed, and quite rightly so. However, it is being blantantly ignored by a number of your guests( fortunately in a minority) I find bare feet in a lounge such as yours during cocktail hours, or while eating food is there quite disgusting.. Unfortunately I must point out that one of your staff members that works in this lounge obviously does not care either.The person I refer to (a female) worked on both the Sunday evening shift and the Monday evening shift (5.30 to 7.30 p.m) on the 29th & 30th of June 2014. At all times she was there she paid no attention what so ever to people walking around without the appropriate footware!! She can not say she did not notice them, as on a couple of occasions she spoke to these people when they asked her questions..To be very frank I was extremely disappointed to see dress standards that I saw whilst I was a guest in your lounge, and even more so to see that your employee in this instance did not care either, but a line must be drawn TANK TOPS, & NO FOOTWARE is not appropriote to a hotel with such high standards as the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles..
Thank you for your time..< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

We noticed a dry snot (with blood) was attached to one of the sheets. It was disgusting. We were already exhausted and very late to change the rooms. So we called the manager and the only thing the hotel did was to say they were sorry. Nothing was done to compensate this. I have already started telling to my friends and neighbors, and will continue to write. I've been to much smaller hotels in smaller towns and have not seen this before.</Review>

We (my daughter and I) tagged along with my husband as he was here for work. We had an amazing experience. Our first experience as we pulled up was only valet parking. I really didnt want to pay the extra money but the valet attendant was so personable, and helpful, it just made me feel like I didnt have to worry about dragging luggage from a park and fly across the street by myself and trying to keep track of my 5 yo. The Bell Hop, Giovanni, AMAZING! From the time we took our luggage out of the car I didnt have to handle it. He took our luggage and said to go check in. It was nice not to deal with it and my child while checking in at the same time. So kind, patiently waited for us. Best well- mannered bell hop I have ever experienced. All of the house keeping ladies on our floor (15) were amazing and helpful. The Club Lounge attendants were all amazing as well! Thank you for keeping ourbellies s full with yummy food and treats! Soda and espresso bar too. Overall, I give this hotel 5 stars Thank you evwryone</Text>

Was upgraded to a large room. Paid parking was behind the hotel unless you were willing to pay for valent which was about $45. 

The Club lounge was small, and the choices were really limited.< /Text>

we were in LA for less than 10 hours...over night stay

Typical experience of a hotel by an airport....high traffic levels, insufficient staff numbers at reception. Those working were excellent

Room was OK - it was room for people with disabilities....the bathroom shower was not in good shape....</Text>

<review>Helps to have gold status here so they give you club access on the 15th floor and rooms on 14th or 15th levels.  Great hotel, great service. Valet parking is ridiculous at $42 a night but its right by LAX. Definitely good for business people.< /review><pics>None</pics><username>Diana Park-Alford< /username><userid>117992015701185225531</userid>< Resp>

terrible stay last time, overpriced and no respect for platinum members. Lounge serve the same food over and over again, cant it vary? I will no longer recommend this hotel. Front desk was rude and constant request for corporate ID, why bother making the reservation ahead. Need new management, the bar is quite good but expensive.< /Review>

First off the website is very misleading, it said free parking, so we booked the room then my husband called to verify our reservation which is when we were hit with the $30 a night parking fee. Very upsetting and all that was offered is $50 towards a future stay, good thing we can use it at a different property. Parking is only $17 if you pay at the gate directly, and the lot is a block away. Check in was a lengthy process. The clerk checking us in had to make a phone call like she couldn't find our reservation, she also didn't speak up or clearly so we could understand her. The room was decent but they charge $26 a person for breakfast. We did not pay that for blah hotel breakfast. Luckily Starbucks is in the lobby. Walls are super thin, sounded like someone was being murdered next door, a lot of banging on the walls and loud thumps on the floor.
Other than that it was ok. At checkout, two clerks were carrying a conversation, did not address us even though both looked at us. My husband had to say I need to checkout. The woman talked fast and over him as if to get us out of the way. We hadn't even walked away before she went back to her conversation. very rude and unprofessional. Will never stay here again. Would have been better off at the holiday inn down the street. We expected more from a Starwood property.<//review>

<text>It was such a great stay at this hotel. I wasn't expected very much cuz i though it's just an another airport hotel but I was very surprised. We booked at the Sheraton Downtown Hotel at first for our LA trip but we changed to this hotel cuz we were going to have the rental car and the car parking itself is $40+ a day at the downtown Sheraton. So, we decided to stay at the Sheraton Gayeway which is still 4stars hotel with the good reviews plus the cheaper parking and great complimentary buffet breakfast. It's totally the winner if you are going to have  the rental car. You can go anywhere in LA within 30-45min Max 1hour but it's worth it you can throw everything you need into your car and you don't have to deal with waiting the public transportation. Free wifi, free breakfast, nice big pool, and a hot tub, everything there make us so pleased and everyone there were very nice, friendly and responded very quickly as well. Don't be hesitate and think too much. This is LA and it's way better than your expectations for the price. Trust me I'm a kind of very detail person always looking for the best one with a great deal and this is the one.<//text><GmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d< /GmapID><response>None</response><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>Upon check-in I approached the gentleman behind the desk (around noon on 6/16/2013). He told me (Gold member) and my co-worker (Platinum member) that it was too early to check-in but he would be right with us. When he was finished with the guest he was with, I explained that we requested an early check-in. We were both just discussing how customer oriented the staff is at this Westin but we were both a little turned off by his comment. Nevertheless, he checked us in.

When I arrived at my room (575) I pulled back the bedspread and the sheets were all wrinkled (fitted and top). The sheets are pressed at this hotel and should not be wrinkled. This indicates to me that the sheets weren't changed and the bed was made with the old sheets from a previous guest and made to look like the sheets were changed. I asked Housekeeping for a new set of sheets. The housekeeper in charge of my room kept telling me that the room was just checked by the supervisor. I suppose that the supervisor does not check the cleanliness of the sheets or that he/she has the same sub-par standards as the housekeeping staff changing (or not changing) the sheets.

I travel all over the world on a regular basis and have only experienced this type of short-cut done at hotels here in the United States. I have never had this type of experience in European or Asian hotels. It happens about 30% of my domestic hotel stays. It's a direct display of laziness by the employees and supervisory staff and should not be an acceptable practice at any hotel especially an SPG hotel.</text></record>

Very bad service. Basically not enough staff. Be ready for long, long, waiting lines at registration or if you have an issue. Parking is far away, and they push you into buying their valet service. Rooms would need a bit of renovation too.

Avoid this hotel.< /Text>

Maybe large corporate sponsored employees expect this form of shakedown, but the weary traveler who runs a small business like myself does not! This hotel will nickel and dime you to death for a night of sleep! $75 deposit for incidentals, $40+ dollars (per day) to valet your rental car. $4 for a Coke at the gift shop. Did i mention that your own LTE data may not work well here (hmm, wonder why?). So you will probably have to pay for hotel wifi too! Bring lotsa cash because your going to need it...oh wait, they don't like cash here, only your credit cards will due!< /text>

Except Valley parking fee of 41 bucks, my stay was perfect. There is a self parking too which costs you 17 bucks and around 10 mins of walking back and forth.< /Text>

Staff at the valet parking is not so friendly. Fast service at the front desk. Room is clean but I am so dissapointed when my reservations says I have free WiFi but when I tried to connect it says I have to pay! No way! I wouldn't choose this hotel if their internet is not free. So I ask the staff at the front desk and he gave me free WiFi for the rest of my stay but only for 1 device!<//Text>

Overall, this is a nice hotel, convenient location, friendly staff, comfortable and quiet rooms. A couple of downsides include: (1) insufficient/inaccessible power outlets near bed (a complaint about most hotels); and (2) mold on the bathroom ceiling from condensation.</text>

I am very disappointed with this facility. My boyfriend and I arrived at about 1:30am and the receptionist could not even locate our reservation. The we were delayed because their Key machine was out of order, then once that came back up we go up to our room and our key doesn't work so we are forced to go back downstairs to then come back up and get the smelliest room I have ever stayed in so we contact the front desk for assistance and are told that they are sold out and we would have to wait for the next day. Suddenly, we get a call to the room that we are indeed being changed rooms...so much for "sold out".
The next day we didn't even get our room cleaned and later realized that they were charging us extra for reasons they couldn't even explain AND they were charging us for two vehicles in the valet parking when we only had one! This made our trip very unpleasant and undesirable :-( Absolutely terrible.</review>

<text>I have stayed at Sheraton facilities several times in the past and found them, as a rule, to be underwhelming but this hotel is definitely the bottom of the pile. From having to check in twice for the same stay, the beat up looking room and the toilet that just would not function, I can only say I was disappointed.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d</GmapID></record>

It's good to see when an airport hotel doesn't rely on a location alone. Quick and friendly checkin and great room with phenomenal airport views (club level). No noice from airplanes at all and the club lounge was great. Not one of the best out there and breakfast lagged, but ok.</text>

I stayed at your hotel on Aug. 5.
I want to tell you about terrible night at the stay.
My room was on the 4th floor.
Many people talked loudly, even screamed around the hallway and the elevator hall.
They seemed to get drunk.
I think they were a group which I watched at conference hall next to lobby.
It lasted until 3 A.M.
I called to the staff thru the phone #0.
But I didn't receive apology or accept any guidance.
When I tried to go to the front desk, many drunken people were in the elevator hall. So I counldn't get the elevator and came back to my room.
I couldn't get a sleep well, so I was very tired.
It was a nightmare.
I came back home and had a bad memory of your hotel.<//text>

<review>So the rooms are really nice an comfortable, I give this an ok rating simply because there is no free parking, no free Wi-Fi seriously the most trashiest of hotels have free Wi-Fi... everything is at an up charge you pay to park, and if you want to exit and return to the out door parking lot that's kinda far from the entrance you pay... all these extras make this place not that great of a value.< /review>< pictures>

Beautiful hotel and quite pleasant. Airport noise level was low, even on the side facing the runways.</review>

<Date>1375740092160<//Date><gmap_id>0x80c2b6d4e2d10a59:0x8fc3dc08704b5f1d<//gmap_id><review>My family and I normally stay at a Marriott or Hyatt; I have only stayed in two Sheraton hotels and have to say I am not impressed! Exhausted, tired kids, and checking in at 10:30 pm. My first impression of the Sheraton Gateway LAX has a distinct smell of bad musk cologne. I kept turning around trying to find the guy that would dive into the much cologne until I realized it was the hotel! When I walked up to the Front Desk the agent did not even look up and greet me. She just stared at the computer screen and asked for my driver's license and credit card - I felt like I was at the DMV. I just stood there waiting for her to look up (which took a few seconds) and then asked her if she even knew what I looked like.  I expressed my disappointment with the last Sheraton I stayed at the night before and was hoping this one would be better. She did express her regret that our last stay at a Sheraton was not a good experience, apologized for the lack of a greeting and offered me four free breakfast buffet vouchers.  I thought that was nice of her.  She asked if I was parking a car and I said yes I was packing a rental car.  She stated there were three options; the first one was a onetime self-parking of eleven dollars, the second option was an in and out self-parking for seventeen dollars, and the third was valet parking for thirty-three dollars.  Thirty-three dollars a night for valet parking... really?  Well, I took the seventeen dollar option and was given a card to use. What I was not told by her was it was not an access card into the airports long-term parking (it appears they do not have a parking lot themselves) so my card was eaten by the machine and I had to wait twenty minutes for an parking attendant to arrive to fix it.

When I finally arrived to room it appeared clean except for the carpet which was dirty and stained. It was not until I climbed into bed and found three type of hairs in-between the pillows that I had an issue with the room - one being a pubic hair. I called down to the front desk to see If I could get the bedding changed and was transfer to another person that agreed to send someone up to the room to take care of the issue. I waited for thirty minutes with my sleepy son until I hear a knock on the door. In walks a guy with two pillows, lays the pillows on the bed and say "okay?!"  I asked if he would change the bedding and he responded with another "okay?!" and turn to leave. I asked him again to take care of the situation and he finally realized what I was asking him to do. His response was to brush the hairs off the bed and onto the floor. At that point he says "okay?!" I told him fine I will deal with other peoples hair and said "okay".

The shower was old and the showerhead was calcified.

The downstairs concierge seemed to never be at the desk when needed.

On the plus side:

Internet was free
There was no "resort fee"

You get one small free bottle of water - three bucks if you want the big bottle! - LOL

The breakfast buffet was good for being free - I would not spend twenty-four for it!

The staff was nice but disorganized and seemed to be just waking up, even though it was about 9:30 am.

The bellhop was friendly and helpful

The shuttle two and from LAX is great and runs every ten minutes.< /review><Rate>1<//Rate><pics>None< /pics><Name>John Stewart</Name><resp>None< /resp><UserId.>106240114588113991738< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

I usually enjoy staying at Sheraton's but the staff were rude and unhelpful. Knocking at 9am, not bringing shampoo after calling for some. They don't understand the benefits of SPG gold member. They tried to charge me for their constant dropping wifi.< /Text>

<Review>My stay at the Sheraton was the biggest disappointment to my weekend getaway. THe water coming out the bathroom faucet had an odor like sewage. The television malfunctioned all weekend. The billing process caused my account to be overdrawn which was due to the front desk not informing me of their billing process. ALL UNACCEPTABLE!</Review>< user_id>

< Review>
We had our worst experience with this hotel and it was an absolute nightmare. We originally stayed for 5 nights and then wanted to book an additional night the following week (since we were leaving for a cruise). We simply asked the front desk to book the additional night with the exact same add-ons we had before when we last booked (eg breakfast, wifi, number of beds etc). They gave us a confirmation and we thought we would be on our merry way. However when we came back from our cruise we were told that we did not ask for breakfast and that we would have to pay extra for it which made no sense since the lady we spoke to for the second booking assured us that the exact same add-ons had been included.

Also when we asked to speak to the same lady we spoke to before in order to sort this out, we were told she was not here....but we later literally spotted her working a couple meters away. When asked why this was we were told she was on her lunch break, but it was around 6-7PM when this happened...

Worst of all, when their front desk supervisor, Gregory Yanez, came out to speak to us he was extremely abrupt, rude and did not show any sympathy. He acted like we were the ones that did something wrong and after giving us our "options" he simply walked away without a second word. When we called him back he explained that he was being "direct." This makes no sense as this is a hotel and we were on vacation, not at a drill camp, there was no need for him to be excessively direct. There was absolutely no customer service involved and we felt like we were being blamed for their mistake. We will no longer stay at this hotel when we visit LA anymore.< /Review>

I have stayed at this hotel several times and always had a good stay. I recently stated here from August 16th - 19th. I had problems from the moment I arrived. When I arrived there was a party going on in the hotel which had been going on non-stop from Friday. There was no where for me to valet my car. I had to drive around the corner at 12:30am to park in a car park. You would think the hotel would keep some parking spots on a Sunday night for business travellers. I had the bellman take my bags up while I parked my car. During that time the door must have closed behind the bellman latching the security bar. When I came up to the room I was unable to enter. It took three phone calls to the front desk and 20 minutes later for me to get it. If this was not enough I asked for a wake up call to catch my early morning flight on my last day and I did not receive it. How can an airport hotel not deliver a wake up call? I filled in an online survey for the hotel, however I am still waiting for a reply!<//text>

We got to our room to find a condom wrapper in the trash, a condom box in a bedside drawer, and an apple in the fridge. Now we have been waiting outside our room for about 10 minutes now for someone to clean this room. Negative stars!< /Review>

This is a nice, 4-star hotel located right next to LAX. Airport noise was minimal, the rooms were clean and updated, the tv was 50", which is above average when compared to most hotels, the staff was friendly and helpful and the hotel has an airport shuttle 24/7, making it a great place to stay if you need to be at the airport early in the morning as we did.</text>

<Review>So for those of you who travel a lot this hotel will not allow you to keep luggage at the hotel for a week or more. This a dealbreaker especially if you are platinum guest. Not only was I denied but the bell hop were almost rude about it. so I was rude back in grand Platinum fashion. That hotel just lost thousands.</Review>< Pics>

I really donot satify your your service.I reserved the Sherton Gateway LA with breakfast included shown in attached reservation letter.I checked in Nov 26 and check out Nov 28 and stay in room 525. But I received bill from Sheraton Gateway and charge me 66.40 USD for breakfast.That's very strange and ridiculous.
I have ever talked your reception in Nov 27 night,she said she will cancel breakfast record . But today I received the bill as attached,the hotel charge me 66.40 USD for breakfast .< /review>

Location near the airport
Breakfast is not good as Sheraton hotel
Staff sometimes doesn’t do what you asked for
For example I asked to bring the Robot Robi to get shampoo and the reception replied that the robot maybe out of service and we will let you know wether it is on or out of service and then no body replied to me they just ignored what I asked for.<//Text>

First, there is no designated drop off at the front of the hotel. The valet "allowed" me to park temporarily, less than 20 minutes, to check in and/or unload. Second, the parking was on the back side of the hotel, about a block away, with the only entrance I knew about being at the front of the hotel. Other than that, the hotel seemed excellent, however, too inconvenient for a family of four.< /review>

Hotel: There was a young latin woman at the front desk who acted with a lack of professionalism.  She should have been working instead of chit chatting as well.

Lounge: There was an older caucasion gentle man at the bar along with an older latin gentleman, both were very polite and courteous. A blond woman with an accent was very pleasant.

Restaurant: A tall french manager along with a latin bar tender who was wearing glasses were both courteous and helpful. There was a short asian woman who was a server at the restaurant, I beleive she is no longer there and thank God because she acted with such a lack of respect and professionalism.
Dinner meal (steak) was good. Dessert was very good. Breakfast (buffet) was good.

Parking: They lost my keys. They were courteous.< /Review>

<response>None< /response><review>I had a corner suite, handicapped accessible. I asked for a refrigerator to house my medications.  When I arrived no refrigerator. called housekeeping, told would cost me 50usd, advised I neededitfor medication, told same price.I said no problem, I would pay. Still no refrigerator.  Discovered room has a few mistakes in it.  I couldnt find the drawer space near bed. Had to go clear accross room for a waste basket.  I asked for roll in shower, but it has a wierd lip trick to keep water in, this would be hard to roll accros or step accross for people who have had a stroke with any leg paralysis.  Its purpose was to hold water in but the shower curtain is at the same parallel location so a tremendous amount of water covered the whole floor.  The light switch is placed to the back ofthe sink.  It is hard to reach, please move it to the outside of the bathroom or on back of closet wall in bathroom.  Also no warming light.  The room is large and you get cold trying to dry off.  There are no switches for the lighting from the bed.  the closet rods are too high, there is no in room safe.  I think that you should rethink just how small the sink is no room for toiletries.  the amenity package of toiletries was horrible, I say again horrible.  You are a Sheraton, a premier hotelier and your amenities come from a 7/11.  I travel every week and I have had better amenities from Motel 8.  The front desk was great and the maids were great.  Had to ask for more towels everyday.  Also It would be great to teach the maid staff that washcloths should be placed in the tub/shower area.  You should do yourself a favor andput yourself in a wheel chair or better yet ask a group of handicappable people to come and showyou how what you have done doesnt work well.  Also you had no hoya lift for the pool...As a training exercise have your engineering staff sit in a wheelchair and try to get around in the hotel.  You will be shocked just how difficult it is.  I will also leave these very comments on hotel website so others can see my review.  Thanks for what you did do well.< /review><user_id>107915435242065522411</user_id><Name>Luis Manuel<//Name><rate>3<//rate>< Gmap_id>

At first glance I was only mildly underwhelmed with my room. I referred to it as "cottage/executive" and thought it was a quaint little space. Once I got settled, however, the filth in the room became glaringly obvious. There were stains on the desk chair, dark handprints on the telephone and a hole (presumably a bullet hole) in the windowsill. The bathroom was worse with a dirty and shockingly outdated shower and the hairdryer was simply propped in the corner - no bag to cover it, and no shelf to place it on. This is my second unsatisfactory Sheraton experience and will be my last..</Text>

<review>I've stayed at several Sheraton hotels recently and I must admit that they been sub-par or average at best. I noticed online that the Gateway had been recently remodeled and had mostly good reviews so I decided to give Sheraton one more try. I'm so glad I did! This was one of the best hotel stays I've ever had. EVERYONE I encountered was friendly and accommodating, the bed was super comfortable and I loved the gym, pool and hot tub. Hats off to the entire management team and staff members for a well deserved 5-star review. I spent 4 nights there and didn't want to leave.

In this review I'm going to address some of the things others brought up here on TA so hopefully you can make an informed decision.

There is a free airport shuttle that runs every 15 minutes making it fast and easy to get to/from the hotel. If you have a car, the hotel promotes valet parking. For self parking, drive into the hotel entrance and head straight back past 98th street and you'll dead end to a privately-owned airport parking lot. They allow Sheraton guests to park there for about $14 a night. You will need to pre-pay and then will get in and out privileges during your entire stay. Warning, the lot fills up on weekends (I arrived on Wednesday so had no problem). I noticed they were turning folks away on Friday/Saturday. There is 2-hour street parking on 98th but you'll get a ticket if exceed the two hour limit so be warned. Valet is expensive -- I think around $24 a night -- about $10 more than self-parking. There may be other parking options nearby but you would need to check with hotel staff.

I arrived at 1:30 pm and being an SPG Gold Member was hoping I could get an early check-in and a complimentary room upgrade. In my recent stays at Starwood properties Gold members don't get decent upgrades so I was pleased that the Gateway recognized my status and upgraded me to the Club Floor (Top Floor, 15th - with Key Access only). I was able to check into my room early but immediately noticed that the air conditioning was making a funny dripping noise (which was pretty annoying). I called the front desk and they sent an engineer up. At first he said I would need to change rooms but he was able to fix the problem after all. I received a follow-up call to see if I wanted to change rooms and I declined. Great service, no problem.

The club lounge was really nice, very large and had a great view of the LAX runway. The lounge has a good selection of fruit, cereal, bagels and juice for breakfast as well as complimentary snacks for dinner. Beer and wine can be purchased from 4-8 pm for a nominal fee. During the day you have access to the lounge where you can work, watch TV, read the paper or get an espresso. A computer/printer is also available for use at no charge. I was able to print my boarding pass there.

The lobby/entrance of the hotel is really nice and features free WI-Fi. Lots of people were hanging out in the lobby with friends, work colleagues or on their computer sipping a glass of wine. Very fun vibe. It has a W feel to it without the annoying drunk/party crowd.

For me, the highlight of the hotel was the gym and pool/hot tub. The gym is big and has a great selection of modern equipment. As for the pool, it was like I had it all to myself. It's also open really late which is a big plus! The pool area has comfy lounge chairs, large daybeds, FREE heated cabanas (great for socializing at night) -- the space is very relaxing and well thought out. My only complaint for the pool area is that smokers hang out there and blow smoke all over you. I wish they didn't allow smoking in the pool area.

The rooms are nice, updated and have great beds. Housekeeping was really friendly and did a great job servicing my room. I only wish there was a safe, fridge and iPod connector in the room. The bathroom was small and a bit dated but functional. I too experienced problems with drainage in the bathtub (as others here have mentioned). The walls are pretty thin and the first night I got awoken at 4 am by some really loud folks in the room next to me. It was really annoying but they must have checked out as the next 3 nights were really quiet. I love that fact that the room was totally dark with the curtains closed. Pitch black... great for sleeping.

We had an amazing dinner Saturday night at the hotel's restaurant called Paparazzi. It's unique Italian food with a twist. With the tip and a bottle of wine, it came to $190 for 3 of us so it was pretty pricy but the atmosphere and food quality was great. Our server was also very efficient and friendly. He explained several dishes to us and how they were prepared. Be sure and get the artichokes as an appetizer. Amazing presentation!

I wish all Sheraton hotels were like the Gateway. I will now look for Sheraton hotels that have been recently remodeled. Many of the older Sheraton hotels are in pretty bad shape. They did a fantastic job with the remodel on the Gateway and I HIGHLY recommend this hotel. The service and friendliness of the staff really stood out for me.

Congrats on a fantastic job Gateway... I'll be back!<//review>< Time>

Rooms were huge. A little cold but that made sense considering it was for a huge bachata festival. The parking situation kinda sucked. Parking was $17-20 with no reentry even if you were staying.< /Review>

<text>Let's get things straight. This hotel is great to stay at if you want to wake up and go to LAX the next morning. No problems there. No problem really with the room either other then a few things such as while the website said Sleep number type beds, mine were springs and not anything amazing. Plus the bathtub wasn't cleaned so yea, bleached that thing after the bath had weird floaty things in it.

The thing that pissed me off is that I paid $34 for valet parking for one day - whatever - BUT - my car was JUST WASHED. The next morning they brought it out DESTROYED from some hard water sprinklers!!! They never even put the car in a garage! They just left it out to get white spots all over it. NOT COOL. I had to run to the airport so had no time to complain.

I'd like my $34 back... AND A CAR WASH! Sheesh... Lame..</text></record>

It was really disappointing and frustrating to hear that i was provided access to the lounge to only find out that I wasn't and I won't be granted because of my status, when every single time in the past in this and other spg properties I was granted access without questions. Also, I have delta crossover benefits that they couldn't associate at the time of reservation for some reason unknown to me. Overall, disappointing experience and I won't be returning to this property again.</Text>

Rooms are fairly nice, and decent size for a hotel near the airport. Prices at the bar are with the usual up charge, but what's odd is that the self park is actually more expensive than the valet.< /review>

Hotel offered little for the price. Rooms were dated and the internet was not included with the rate. The internet was the slowest of any hotel brand I have used and you want to charge for it.</text>

Worse service ever. Paid for Valet and they didn’t even bring the car, they asked us to walk to it. Had just got off a 16 hour flight from Doha and signed the check and forgot the credit card, waiter was extremely rude about it.< /text>

<Review>After a long day I went to the bar to have a drink and order dinner. Greg the bartender was unwelcoming to the point I felt uncomfortable and made for a negative experience for the evening. I had to ask for service each time. I don’t recommend anyone frequent the bar after a long day. Unnecessarily uncomfortable and unwelcoming.< /Review>< pics>

去酒店时，半夜12点，由于堵车，shuttle bus没有停靠在我们的航站楼，连续两辆都是这样，害得我们走到下一个航站楼才上车。离机场很近，非常方便，房间也不吵。15层的早餐很好，有中式的点心和粥，味道也不错。我有一个晚上，叫服务员送拖鞋，两次都答应，但是没来，还是第二天早上跟前台说的才送上来的。一层大堂吧不错，有中式餐饮，还有室外部分，可以吸烟。<//Text>

It is conveniently close to the airport and rental car facilities. The downside is the constant jet noise if you are a light sleeper.</review>

I was charged for internet service. As a platinum member, this is complimentary. Now I have to spend time calling accounting at the Sheration Gateway to remove the charge. I really think you need to train your staff on this as this is not the first time this has happened.< /Text>

The worst hotel ever, there are insects in the shower place. Bad and dirty hotel. If you can go to another hotel if you can. Also, they charge you for the parking lot. No free parking 👎 my room was 822</Review>

We first got into a room and started unpacking, and I saw a spider on the curtain! I'm terrified of bugs but decided to kill it instead of actually calling someone up, it was already late at night at this time. The walls must be very thin- because during the whole stay I could hear music playing from the next room which was really distracting. My cousin who stayed in the bed closer to the door commented that she had trouble sleeping because she could hear the slamming of other doors in the next rooms. Since it's so close to the airport there didn't seem like much to do nearby.< /review>

I'm from Canada and I always hear that California has a water problem. If that is the case, then you need to reduce the water pressure and/or install new shower heads. Every time I took a shower I felt like I was emptying a lake. I talked to the receptionist and she said that they had installed low flow shower heads, but that people complained. We need to put the planet ahead of our personal desires.<//review>

Had an early morning flight so to ensure i got up in time in case my mobile failed i requested a morning wake up call, the hotel staff recorded my details yet failed to ring me at 4am and my mobile unfortunately had lost battery.
The response i got was who did i place the call with and that they apologise for the inconvenience...this inadequate response resulted in return flight to london being lost< /Review>

Waited at check in near midnight for literally more than a half hour with a queue forming behind me. Staff all disappeared behind door and did not come out until I called the hotel number to let them know there are people waiting. Staff appeared unapologetic, blaming computers problems. Very unpleasant experience.<//Review>

<text>Subpar service.  My flight was cancelled to LA and they did absolutely nothing to help transfer my reservation over to the next night or even let me use their facilities to freshen up.  Not their fault my flight was cancelled but other hotels have gone much further out of the way to make the best of a miserable situation.< /text>< Response>

This time this the roomwas less clean, there was a problem of faucet factory and the bedding creaked it's a pity another time of front it was very well. The valet parking lot is too expensive, the catering service Sunday evening is pitiful, the waiters are overwhelmed and the orders are badly taken we hope to be lucky enough(have the opportunity) to know the renovated rooms because in spite of posters in the hotel we have never had new room.<//Text>

Room was clean, but even though 4 people were staying in the room, there were only three towels. We asked the front desk to bring more towels, and they took forever to show up. No fridge and microwave.< /Review>

When I checked in I was asked if I wanted bonus points or other amenities - no one told me that meant that my room would not be cleaned - and my bed would not be made - that was fixed and housekeeping was right on top of the clean up - once they knew of the problem

When I turned on the TV - it didn't work - one of the line on the phone didn't work and on my last day there was a bug in the shower -

Engineering fixed the TV quickly but the phone was never fixed -

when I told the front desk about the bug - they didn't even apologize -< /Text>

The airport shuttle is a partnership between the hotel and an adjacent parking lot company. This is the second time the shuttle has been very late to pickup at the airport. I had to call to find out about the status of the shuttle; very frustrating to see the other hotels' shuttles regularly passing by. Food portions are small for the price.</Text>

Service is lacking and management does not seem to care about constructive comments.This extends to lack of attention to status. No offer of upgrade or any comments thereto.

Hotel shuttle takes a lifetime.< /Review>

<review>I was dropping off family members staying here in order to catch an early flight the next morning. The valet staff didn't help unload luggage(I did it all, whatever). I also had to specifically request a bellman come get the luggage that I had set on the curb after the valet staff told me they "couldn't be responsible" for the luggage because they were too busy with helping all the cars, even though they gave zero service to the family members I dropped off. Slightly annoying.<//review></record></dataset><record>

We waited for a while to finally see someone from inside to come out to help. ( somehow staff saw people were waiting but no one came out to help until one of customers requested!)
And it was disappointed that when there is a line created specific for spg preferred guest so we waited there considering we are the member but yet we were waiting along with the regular line and were asked to go regular counter when our turn was up.

Then it took them a while to locate an available room based on what we booked.

There were an human error on room assignment. And then we finally were directed to the right room and realized they were still rushing the cleaning process.

And then next morning, the hotel employee accessed to our room without knocking. He shut the door when he realized we still in the room but I went after him because I tried to figured out if it were another double booking instance but then happen to learn he is the mechanic related position in the hotel.

Mattress was worn too so it was not comfortable.
We booked this hotel due to location. We stayed here the first night of our vacation and will stay here again the last night of our vacation. However, after the first time experience, we are not excited the fact we have to return this hotel.

Every once a while, some of these instance happens. We were just out of luck to experience them all together in one stay when we were exhausted from the travel.<//text>

When I entered my room my bathtub was half full of brown water and faucet was leaking. there was also a stain in the bedrooms ceiling to indicate that the room above at one poinr may have had the same problem but could have been painted over and was unsightly. Maint. was called and he stated that it was not only my room but the room next door. when it was complete as I took a shower the shower drain was not fast enough to drain so about 1 inch of water pooled.< /text>

< Review>
So we booked a deluxe room at this place for which they billed us 600$ ...this place charges 50$ per day for parking, there is no free WiFi and the breakfast is 26$ + taxes per head, the rooms were average, the only good thing about this place is the proximity to LAX....the staff wasn't welcoming at all....for a Sheraton with 4 stars this place is a disgrace....we shortened our stay and left for an AirBnb that was one third the cost and completely loaded.</Review>
