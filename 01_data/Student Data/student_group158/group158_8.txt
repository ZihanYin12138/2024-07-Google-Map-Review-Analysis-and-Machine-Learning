My first appointment was on a Tuesday for my dog with a growth on
his leg.  Dr. Mandel found it to be melanoma and called me after hours
to give me the news.  This was on a Friday.  On Saturday (her time off)
she arranged to have him seen by a visiting specialist on the following
Friday because of a heart condition my dog has and will need to
be addressed before the growth can be removed.  She also fit me in
to her practice for tests to make sure the cancer has not traveled.  Dr. Mandel truly cares and wants to give the best possible care
for your pet.  I truly can't thank her enough!!  My doggie has a much
better chance of getting through this because of her!!  Her staff is
great also!</review>

<text>They lost my dogs medical records for the la say two years. Then told me i must have changed my name, or the $150 i spent September of 2020 was for heart worm not for actual vet services. When it most definitely was because my dog was sick.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

JeffPark takes awhile, most likely a  result of  lockdown, and a bit pricey but Dr. M is the best and you get what you pay for.  Bailey was one of her first patients 9 and a half years ago, just six months old and could fit in the palm of your hand.  She wouldn't be here now without her.  Saved her bacon more than once since.  I'd go as far as to say with Dr. M you get several vets in one, with her extensive degrees and training.  Love our chats.  Staff is great as well.  The best for your furry companion.</Text>

It is so gratifying to all of us to take care of a patient over time and identify, diagnose and treat the problem and make them better. Moreover, that long term relationship with Bailey and her "parents" is special as well.  Glad your girl is doing so well!!! P.S. Yes, the COVID lockdown does make veterinary practice more challenging. Thank you and all our patients and clients for their patience and understanding during these times.

<Review>I like the people here but it shouldn't take 2+ hours to examine a dog. He wasn't traumatized and that's a good thing but I left 3 hours between that appointment and another one and almost didn't make the second appointment. I also think a pet owner HAS to be allowed in despite COVID, for a first visit.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Excellent vet and staff. I always choose a vet just based where I live (I never do any research) so I am really lucky to have found this place.  I’ve lived in 4 different cities since getting this cat, so I’ve been to 4 different vets. This one is by far the best. This vet is really good with my difficult and grumpy cat, and you can tell she really actually cares. Her staff is wonderful too. I feel grateful to have found them, and if I move again, I will continue to come here.< /Text>< Response>

<Review>Excellent care !  I just adopted a tiny deaf white Persian kitty who has had multiple medical problems her whole life.  Many requiring surgery and many needing long term care. Daisy is frightened of anyone touching her, and any vet care at all is just plain hard to do. Her Persian fur was the worst matted mess I have ever seen.  These are the folks that were recommended to me and was I ever pleased. We talked in the room and developed a plan of care before Daisy was even handled. Then with precision we started, Dr Mandel gave a little sedation that was easy and gentle on her system to begin with and then did all of the needed tests and ended with removal of all of her mats.  They were so deep that she had to shave her down to pink! Then with gentleness and care she held Daisy until she awakened from the sedation and I took her back.  If you want good care and a deeply knowledgeable  Doctor to care for your pet.  This is the place !!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I have a 15 year old cat who has always been terrified to go to the vet. His sweet personality would change and he’d get so scared that he wouldn’t let anyone near him without trying to attack them. It was extremely stressful for both of us. I felt helpless when I discovered a lump in his tail, fearing he wouldn’t let anyone examine him without causing him great stress.

But Dr. Mandell (The Cat Whisperer) ❤️ was so sweet and patient with him. She even got him to take treats from her hand, and I was shocked! He was able to get examined and also received the surgery needed, and she treated him with care. I felt a lot of peace in trusting Dr. Mandell and staff with my cat and I’m very grateful for all their help! I won’t take my cat anywhere else! ❤️</Review><gmapID>0x809ad14d52540d63:0xf7a394464258b5c5</gmapID>< rate>

Dr. Mandell is wonderful!  She cares about each of her patients and clients.  She has vast experience and the ability to run tests in-house, and she will help you decide what is right for your pet even when the decisions are tough.  The prices are very reaonable. Highly recommended!< /Text>

Our pitbull was very difficult with the Dr so they asked if we could leave him with them and they would give him a sedative and check his ear infection. Went great and would recommend them if you live in the area!</text>

<review>I'm sure a great place but after what they did to us I'm disappointed in there live for a pet. . It seems more about money,  I took my cat in 12 min before 6 pm cuz my cat seemed as if he'd been poisoned so we rushed in and were told because staff would have to stay over 6 pm we were gonna get a walk in emergency charge and seemed to not really want to see our baby,  they told us it would be best to go some where else , it's pretty sad when some one comes in desperate to help there animal and it's about money and them wanting to go home over a animals life.  And my animals are regular customers and had been seen there before for there shots but our vet was out so the other would have to step in. . NOT GOOD BUSINESS.. YOUR SUPPOSE TO CARE MORE ABOUT ANIMALS THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY DID. :( SAD we found another place that was closed but had no problem looking at with no charge and told us what to do. . They cared and it showed.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x809ad14d52540d63:0xf7a394464258b5c5< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The Dr. claims to be the dog whisperer and will not let you make a choice in your pets care. As she put it, "I'm the "veterinarian." We went in for head congestion and was told it could be heartworms. She also proceeded to squeezed my dogs treachea to prove tracheal bronchitis. Yup, she will gag if you squeeze her trachea. I asked her if we could treat the congestion first, before ordering tests and she insisted on a heart worm test and xrays. The doctor walks in very combative and thinks she knows it all before reading the chart or discussing the symptoms with you. After she hushed my dog and pressed her fingers on her to supposedly "calm her down", I lost all faith in her. My dog wasn't doing anything, instead, looking at her while she imitated Cesar Milan by pressing her fingers into my dog and shushing her over and over. When I thanked her for her time, she asked how much I expected to spend. I looked at her and said I wanted to treat her cold and if that didn't work we should then do more labs. She was offended that I had an opinion about my dogs care. She is crazy and money hungry, don't go there. Before walking out she let me know I would spend more money going to the VCA.< /Text><userid>104617417012145311622<//userid><Name>K Guerrero (KAG)</Name><GmapID>0x809ad14d52540d63:0xf7a394464258b5c5</GmapID></record>

This is the best Vet clinic ever.... I do TNR (trap neuter & Release) in my neighborhood & I brung my Socsy & Sammie for their shots & Emergency checkups. This has been the BEST Vet ever. I was even given a opportunity to make payments once on an Emergency for my very Ill cat Socsy (15 yr old tux kitty) with Hypothyroidism & is on hypoallergenic hydrolized protein that costs $56 biweekly. It gets expensive but since I come ever two weeks. My cat is still alive & I appreciate Dr Mandell ... Had it not been for Dr Carroll Mandell Socsy would be Dead he was so sick, I didn't know how sick he was.. she saved him. DR MANDELL also performed the spaying on Sammie & gave me a deal on the E -collar. I love this clinic its the Best.. so clean , & the nurses are so gentle with the babies  (kitties)
I'm stopping by today before closing to get Socsy's Hypoallergenic food...
I know I won't have to wait long. Everyone is super nice may God Bless them.< /text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>Be careful taking your pets here! They're more interested in selling services than your companions well being. They wanted to hospitalize my puppy for an upset stomach after testing negative for parvo. When I declined hospitalization they wanted to charge me $115 for blood work but could not tell me what they were testing for. Customer service leaves a lot to be desired as well. I had to stand at the desk for way too long without being acknowledged by the receptionist while she spoke to a vendor on the phone. Total waiting time in the room was almost 2 hours. This does not include a 20 minute lecture by the vet tech about what a bad puppy owner I am. They wouldn't even let me out of the room to pay for the services, made me wait while they ran my card. And even asked me not to let Stella's paws touch the floor on the way out! I went to another vet in Sacramento for a second opinion. He advised me to feed Stella rice, cottage cheese, yogurt and canned pumpkin for 2 days. Add chicken the 3rd day. And begin mixing in her puppy food after that. He also advised administering pepto-bismal with a syringe to settle her stomach and mix pedialyte with her water for dehydration. Wish I had gone to him first. I would have saved almost $100 for an unnecessary fluid IV (which I practically had to administer myself) and an anti-nausea injection. I wonder how many clients would have followed this vet's first recommendation to hospitalize my 7 week old puppy. And to the vet tech with the pit bull with skin allergies and neurotic Labrador that destroys your furniture when you don't exercise her because she's afraid of the rain who lectured me.....please read this. "The primary and most important time for puppy socialization is the first three months of life. During this time puppies should be exposed to as many new people, animals, stimuli and environments as can be achieved safely and without causing overstimulation manifested as excessive fear, withdrawal or avoidance behavior. For this reason, the American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior believes that it should be the standard of care for puppies to receive such socialization before they are fully vaccinated." I would add that many skin problems in dogs are caused by stress that can be alleviated with proper exercise. And your lab wouldn't tear up your furniture if you exercised her daily (and that doesn't mean a simple walk around the block when the sun is shining) And who ever heard of a Labrador being afraid of the water??! She's afraid of the rain because you never take her out to play in it! But what do I know? I'm no vet. But I don't appreciate the lecture or the attempt to extort my hard earned dollars for unnecessary and psychologically damaging treatment like leaving a 7 week old puppy in a cage overnight because she's slightly dehydrated from a mild case of a sore tummy. I will never set foot in this establishment again and I would advise anyone reading this to seek treatment elsewhere<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I recently purchased a new car and was anxious about where I would get my windows tinted. My experience with Jet Black was pretty stellar.

1) I called the (510) phone # and spoke to an agent who got me scheduled in less than 5 minutes (also was stoked to discover this location here in San Fran.

2) Showed up and was greeted by the branch manager, Ibrahim, who showed me the different tints, a visual/physical demonstration with a heat lamp to show climate response, and a total.

3) Walked over to Gus's Community Market 3 blocks away where you can sit outside and enjoy coffee or pass by the time (which is amazing because Jet Black does not have a seating/waiting area).

4) Returned 2 hours later to an awesome job.

Cost ended up around 350 tax included-- keep in mind I chose the Ceramic tint versus the other tints (which looked also pretty stellar).

Overall, amazing job to Ibrahim and the staff. Appreciate your services both in the detail as well as making the process as a customer enjoyable.< /Review>

<review>I went to one of their other locations in Walnut Creek about 6 months ago and they did a pretty good job since then got a new car and moved to San Francisco and found out they have a new location so I was like oh cool I already know their name. Then I looked online they had a deal on their website got the whole car done for 140 bucks. Want to use their other location I had a group on but I'm pretty sure that what I paid with the deal on their website was a better deal than the Groupon. Of course that deal was for like the cheapest kind of thing they have I guess they have three different grades you know the top one being ceramic I got the cheapest one, and my car is hella dark you can't see inside it. They did a great job... Thanks jet black< /review>< UserId.>

Had my Avalon windows done. Ibrahim was super helpful in the details of the job. Got hooked up and even got to tour the city while waiting. Jet black tint was recommended to me by a friend. I had a good experience and satisfied with the work.< /Review>

Initially, I was pleased to get a same day appointment. The call center was very nice and efficient as were the in person staff at this San Francisco location (at 1st). TL;DR: double quoted wait time, mess left inside car, trunk and no mask usage by staff / don't clean equipment before/after customers.

I was quoted 1.5-2 hours work time. I had even upgraded from a partial tint to tinting the whole car (still with same quotes time). I didn't receive my car back until 3.25 hours later! I came in at 2 hours and noticed they'd just began working on my car despite saying there was only 1 car ahead of me. I was scolded by the manager for coming in w/o being called - likely b/c of this discovery. He said it'd be just 30 mins. That turned out to be an hour later.

I had my car detailed just before I came - there was water all over the floor and floor of my trunk, stains all over the door paneling and dirt tracked into driver's side floor.

Also, the manager and staff working on cars did not wear masks or gloves. Even when the manager came into the office, he'd only wear one as he entered the office. The salesperson signed paperwork after touching his mask and had me use the same pen.

ZERO apologies for the delay, no compensation offered despite me tripling the original service I asked for. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone!< /text>

This place is good if you want a horrible tint job and your car glass scratched! Hard to tell in photos but all 4 windows of my brand new 2021 charger are scratched! All workers aren’t wearing mask or gloves. Was quoted $149 tint but the kept insisiting to get the ceramic tint which I did, I paid for the most expensive tint and the work done was horrible! Even I can do better. Tint is full of dust and air bubbles. Lastly the worker quoted 1 hour and a half but I waited 3 and a half.<//review>

Came in today.  Had to use my friends profile since I don’t have an account. But I would like to express my experience here. I have gotten tint plenty of times. I know the bubbles go away eventually but there’s lots of dirt!! I can feel it in the film!! Also one large line on back windshield which I believe is a crease.

Never  👎. Terrible work.< /text>

I did my 2020 Rav 4 here last month and the job was absolutely amazing, the reason I gave the review after one month is because they told me it took 3 weeks for the water spots and tiny bubbles to go away but I didn’t believe them but as I waited, they went all away and it looks beautiful< /Review>

I did my 2020 Rav 4 here last month and the job was absolutely amazing, the reason I gave the review after one month is because they told me it took 3 weeks for the water spots and tiny bubbles to go away but I didn’t believe them but as I waited, they went all away and it looks beautiful</Text>

<review>Really bad job tint, my tint has bubbles in it and it's also poorly cut and fit in my car and not to even mention had me waiting until closing with another 2 people that also got a bad tint job, never going back or getting a tint job from them.<//review>< time>

< Review>
I dropped my car off here they called me 2 hours later and told me my car was done , when I returned to the place my car was still parked in front of the binding untouched I asked they guy why they called me if it wasn’t done , he said he’ll get on it now and it will be done in 30 mins after a hour and 30 mins of waiting he brings my car out with the wrong front tints ! then he offers to redo the tints just to still do it wrong again ! At that point I just left but never will I ever come to a place like this</Review>

Great location for tinting your cars guys . Rafi is a professional guy,super friendly,he is educated person, he has a lot of explanations about there work quality and materials they’re using. I got their vortex ceramic film and it’s super cool make a new face for my car. I definitely go back there with my new cars.<//Review>

BEST chicken wings I've ever had. The coating on the wings remains perfectly crunchy underneath a super flavorful sauce. Look around and you'll see that every table orders the wings. The lines are long on weekends though, so expect a wait if you go.<//text>

Pretty mediocre, it was a bit pricey for just okay food. We ordered 2 different items and only the sauces had flavor, the noodles and chicken/beef were pretty plain. The grilled scallions were inedible so had to toss them. The beef and chicken strips are pretty dry and all the flavor comes from the spices so that was a disappointment. The yakult mango drink was great. Cashier wasnt rude really but just...totally indifferent</review>

< Review>
Not so many restaurants have spicy grilled fish. We decided to try here. Even my friends warned me the service was really bad. However, the service is surprisingly ok. People are friendly and helpful, just the cashier’s English is not good.

We are seating a patio seat, it’s not really comfortable but the weather is really nice.

Recommending the Kingfu grilled fish, it’s so flavorful and tasty. It’s really big portion can feed two people.

The pork ribs dry pot is not so good, the ribs are really dry with barely any meat.</Review>

I tried the grilled fish too. The fish is not but but a little salty. Definitely don't order that for two people!!! They told me that the fish is for two, however, I think that is good for 3 people.</review>< pictures>

<review>There are better places with better service then here. Perhaps my experience was bad, but at least the food was good enough. I enjoyed my rice and drink. My meat was a bit rubbery.

This place was so trash all the way around. The service was rude and they don’t label there food. It all looks like garbage which should have been an indicator. The food was so horrid we had to throw it out after one bite. We brushed our teeth but the taste still lingered. The chicken was hard and chewy and beef was like paper and lifeless. The rice was more of a soup. Everything was disgusting. DO NOT EAT HERE.</review>

<Text>New Taiwanese spicy beef noodle place in town. I just had to try. It seems like the old Hen House moved to Albertsons place on campus and Kingfu moved in their spot. I tried their signature dish, beef noodle soup, with knife-cut noodle. When I witnessed the chef stretched out the dough to make noodle I knew this noodle should be awesome. I was right about the noodle. The noodles were doughy and flat to my liking. Their broth on the other hand was bit flat and their chunk of beef was average. We also tried their green onion pancake and it tasted like it was just cooked prior and reheated before they serve.< /Text>< pictures>

After dining at this restruant, ordered the Braised Chiken over rice, I had serious stomachache. After I went to bed, things got worsen, I go to restroom to try to release my stomach, but suddenly a huge pressure from my stomach pushes all the food out of my mouth. I throw up the food, along with blood colored liquid. I will report this to Orange Conty FDA. This restraunt is so terrible!</text>

Not sure how they stay in business. Their Spicy Brisket soup tastes like toxic mixture prob MSG and something else. These people have no idea what quality food should be like. I would not give this kind of food to my dog in fear of poisoning him.</Text>

<Review>I don't want to say they are racist but I think they might be. I went at night to eat and they said they were closing so I walked away. A minute later I noticed them serving another customer who was also Chinese like they were. They only serve customers who are Chinese I guess. Oh well, I guess they are racist then.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Place was not neat at all, trash can was full and rift in front of entrance. Food was nothing to impress at all, we asked for Chaomin steak and the flavor of the noodles was just like any other, so was the "steak" (poor flavor)
We had a whole plate left over and since, even tho the food wasn't that good, I was not going to waste my money (which to me was a lot, $25 or so with the mango smoothy, which buy the way was the only good thing in my order) when my daughter went to ask for a container to go, the cashier totally ignored her and even turned his back at her to continue his conversation over the phone.
I went and got the to go container and even tho the cashier was nice and friendly I was already desapointed at the food, the place and the service.
Definitely not in my list of places to recommend and even less to re visit.  The only good thing about this place is that they close late and if you're really really really reaaaaaally! Starving and really really reaaaaaally have no other choice whatsoever, than this would probably be a "good" option. As for me, I'd  rather go get a 7/11 hot dog...<//Review>

Customer is really not the king here. I was in there just to buy a drink. MThere was no one at the counter. Staff member just beyond the cashier station did not want to charge me for my drink and kept me waiting, untill the cashier apperared after a lengthy period.</Review>

Nor so good. I did the steam tray. Kung pow and greasy eggplant. I mean spicy, but oh it was greasy. Eventually I found a couple peanuts in the grease is the chicken. Worst part, the beer was lukewarm.< /review>

We ordered two dishes: #1 KingFu Braised Beef brisket soup with tri-colored noodles and #8 "Secret eight treasure" hot sauce with knife cut noodles. The beef brisket soup was ok, a little bland and tasted like instant-noodle soup base, nothing special. The tri colored noodles felt under-cooked, hard, and clumpy. Definitely not the Taiwanese comfort food I was craving.

Then the secret eight treasure noodles... first I'll say the knife cut noodles were done pretty well... but that's about the only good thing about the dish. First it came out as a soupy noodle, I expected dry noodles mixed with the sauce based on the pictures. Putting "secret eight treasure" in a soup base is probably one of the silliest things I've seen. The whole appeal of secret eight treasure is the contrast in textures of each treasure from the crunchy peanut to the soft bean curd. Putting it all in a soup for hours on end resulted in a bland mush that had 0 contrast. And I'm pretty sure there weren't "eight" treasures in that soup... felt more like 3 or 4, and then there weren't even very much, maybe just a few spoonful and the rest was just the same bland watery soup base. Overall, very disappointed with the dish and would never order again.< /review>

We'll be sure to take your feedback on the Secret Eight Treasure into consideration moving forward, too, because we want to offer only the best to our customers. Truly, this isn't the real Kingfu Master standard, and we hope we'll get the chance to prove that someday. - The Team at Kingfu Master"}</response>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Their fried noodles are unpalatable batch. I might as well go to the supermarket to buy a pack of instant noodles and cook it myself. The blood is unpalatable. It's very unpalatable. Don't buy
The service attitude is average and it’s not very good. I have eaten several times before. The grilled fish is delicious and the big sister at the counter was also good. Today’s service is very poor and I have never seen it before.

I'd rather go to the supermarket and buy a packet of instant noodles and cook them myself. Mixed sauce noodle tastes very bad!!!!!!!!! Don’t buy it!!!!
I've been here a few times before and the grilled fish was delicious. And the waitress at the counter was also nice. Today, the service was really bad!!! It was another woman new there.

他们家的炸酱面 难吃的一批 我不如去超市买一包方便面自己煮了吃 血难吃 超难吃 贼难吃 Don't buy
服务态度也一般般 不是很好 之前我也来吃过几次 烤鱼很好吃 而且之前那个柜台大姐也不错 今天这个服务就很差 之前也没见过 总之炸酱面超难吃

(Translated by Google) Half an hour after my boyfriend ate their home yak chicken rice, suddenly the stomach began to vomit with severe pain. He has already complained about the alarm. It can be unhygienic to such a degree. I suggest that you should not consider it for your own body. How much nausea can make people have sore stomach pains. Really a business without a moral bottom line.

(Translated by Google) The service staff inside really has a very bad attitude. There is a man with glasses who feels bitter and hatred every day. There is also a thin woman with long hair who has never seen him laugh and the boss will not look at it Is it rated? There is only one tall waiter in this shop, which is very good. No other waiter has a smile on his face. There is no smile, no smile, I really don’t want to tip, now I will never go again, but it must be To come back and evaluate, ask them to collapse as soon as possible, or the boss should rectify the service attitude of the clerk.

里面的服务人员真的态度极差,有一个戴眼镜的男的,天天就感觉苦大仇深的.还有一个瘦瘦的女的,长头发,就没见他笑过,老板就不看评价的吗?这个店里只有一个高高的服务生,很不错.其他的没有一个服务生脸上有笑脸.没有笑容,没有笑容,真不想给小费,现在我再也不去了,但是一定要回来评价一下,请他们尽快垮掉,或者老板应该好好整顿一下店员的服务态度.< /review>

<review>So I looked on Google and read the reviews so I was very skeptical a visiting. But I looked passed the reviews and come to find out this is by far the best plasma donation center I've seen in my 7 years of donating. First off all of the staff are super nice and great at their jobs. They comfort you they feed you and they hydrate you. They are very understanding when it comes to certain situations. Also the wait time is not as long as people make it seem because the experience is so great. Everything is fast and efficient and you meet some great people at this location from staff two donors. They compensate you with cash instead of a prepaid debit card. And on your first visit they tell you it's going to be 4 to 5 hours but usually it's only an hour and 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on how many people are there. The only thing is that it's so far if you are on public transportation in coming from Mid-City San Diego but it is fully worth it once you get there because the experience is amazing everybody is so nice. I even seen a you familiar faces that transferred from another location to work here so that made me feel even more comfortable. Big shout-out to this place and great job at what you do keep up the hard work. Sincerely Jonathan usher Raymond 🙂</review>< pics>

< review>
The nurses here are awesome. They understand that you are in for a long wait your first time, and do a great job getting people in as quickly as possible. Evelyn was the nurse who helped me my first time, and she's as amazing as she is gorgeous! Fast and friendly and I was done with my screening and on to my physical. I've gone a few times since my first visit, and the staff has always accommodated patients properly. I even got a fast pass because of a clerical error on the FDA's part. So even though it wasn't their mistake, they did what they could do fix the issue and not make me wait any longer than I should have originally. Minerva and Lucy are both very precise with the needles also. I've never had an irritation even when using the same arm back to back. Thank you so much guys!< /review>

<text>The place is a nightmare.  I went in at 12 30 PM and didn't get out until 7 o clock.

The lady notified me it's a "christian" facility so they have that weird passive aggressive religious thing going for them .

All in all I wasted my entire day surrounded by a bunch of morons who'd rather wait 6 hours for 25 dollars then go work for the day.

A good portion of these people are unpleasant and have an offputting demeanor.

I wont be going back it is a big waste of time<//text>< Pictures>

<text>Horrible place to donate. Incompetent staff. Lazy, unhelpful people, including management. Huge waiting times. I waited 5 hours my first time and they still wouldn't let me donate because my blood pressure was about 104 bpm.  I highly discourage you from donating here. If your blood pressure is even a half point over 100 they wont take you in. Nowhere else even cares. Anywhere else you can pound 18 monsters right before going in and they'll take care of you. Not this place. Dont waste your time. I tried 4 times to donate here and every time they turned me away for one reason or another.<//text>< Pictures>

It's so freaking dumb that they pick up all these Mexicans from across the border do donate and you get pushed to the back of the line. Its ridiculous.  We are the ones living here. So if you dont have mail in San Diego you cannot donate but u can live in Mexico ??!! Dude we live here our money is being spent here it's more expensive to live here. It's not fair completely unethical.</Text>

They shuttle people by the masses from mexico. How its legal is past me, but its not worth it. 2-3 hour wait times everyday. Nobody speaks English except the people that work there. Smells like a gutter and the techs suck at putting a needle in the right vein.<//text>

The facilities look really nice but their customer service makes it not worth it. That's unfortunate. I was really hoping I could donate here. Sent me away the first day because they said I had to make an appointment, so fine, I made one. I arrive and they tell me it will be at least a 5 hour process because they are understaffed. I told them I was fine with that, so they took me to get a vein check. They then proceeded to quickly deduce my veins were too small and send me away! Now, I donate at Biomat all the time and have never had any problems. I would have loved to donate at Scantibodies but it just didn't work out.< /text>

I called the plasma center to get information about donating plasma and spoke to a lady named Jasmine. She was very sociable and friendly, and comforting when I voiced my concerns. I signed up to donate and they told me all that was involved and even reminded me to eat a good breakfast beforehand. Unfortunately, I had to cancel the appointment later, but overall I was very impressed with their customer service.<//review>

<Name>Aly Kat< /Name><Date>1533283496373<//Date><rating>1< /rating><text>Terrible experience, left very upset with this place. I have never donated plasma before, I requested an appointment through the online system. I received a call right away booking my appointment for the next day at 7am. The woman that booked was nice and gave me the rundown of what I needed for my first time. I live in Imperial Beach. I drove the 20 miles to get there by 7am. I brought my 1 year old son in his stroller. When I buzzed in at the gate to get through the handicapped gate (the main one was a revolving door) I was denied, without an apology, through the intercom. "No one under the age of 18 is permitted."
I asked "Is there anything I can do? I commuted all the way from Imperial Beach."
The girl dismissively said no and clicked.
I can't imagine plasma donation being any different than a doctor's visit, where children are allowed. If I would have known, I would have arranged for childcare. NOWHERE ON THE WEBSITE DOES IT SAY YOU CANNOT BRING CHILDREN NOR WAS I NOTIFIED BY ANY REPRESENTANTIVE.
It was a complete waste of my morning and the little gas I had left in my tank to get there.
Work on your professionality and advertising.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80d958533fd6e267:0x18df514ded84b260< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Being a donor at Scantibodies Plasma Center is a wonderful opportunity to help save lives and supplement your income. I started donating last month and feel the rewards of being able to help others and also provide for my family. The facilities is super clean, the staff is friendly and it only takes a few hours a week. I am grateful for that this plasma center has blessed the community of El Cajon.< /Review>

<Review>This is the cleanest and nicest plasma donation facility in the universe. Everything is new and nice, and there is a lot of people working here. I usually don't wait long to donate as a returning donor. Octopharma is a dump compared to here. There is security here, nice people, and they want you to be there, and they pay cash! Love this place, and I drive several miles just to donate here for a faster donation, amazing restrooms, cash, and better customer service.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Thought this would be an easy way to help out and get a bit of extra cash for doing so. Completely regret it, it's been a miserable experience.

I had a 1:30pm appointment. After an exceptionally long wait (four and a half hours), they decided I couldn't donate because my vein was small.

That's one of the first things the nurse checked when I arrived.

It took me four and a half hours to not donate for something they should have screened in the first 15 minutes. And then, after the nurse said I would still be compensated...  I received a mere $10. After 15 minutes of arguing to try to get paid the $40, they added on a $5 Subway gift card.

There's other donation centers in San Diego.  I suggest using those, and NOT Scantibodies.</Review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Zero stars honestly. I walked in as soon as they opened Saturday I believe it was 6:30 am. I spoke to a gentleman at the front desk because I had a couple questions and he’s just standing there looking stupid not saying anything. He had to go find someone else to answer my simple question, why are you at the front desk and you don’t know how to do your job? They had me read all these papers and sign all these things. Told me my wait would be about 3 hours because apparently they have a bus that’s brings people in from god knows where and somehow it bumps me down the list. About 40 min after I sat there they told me I couldn’t donate at all because my I.D had expired on my birthday 2 days prior. Mind you my I.D was the FIRST thing they asked for smh just a waste of time, found another plasma center who doesn’t mind an expired I.D, it’s still me it’s still my I.D with MY picture on it. These people are just ignorant. I recommend Biomat off of 70th street in la Mesa or hell EVEN octapharma on duke street yes I said it!</Text>< pictures>

<review>Horrible place to go. So not come here a this place discriminates against homeless people. We're all human, we all have blood in our bodies, we all have/ or used to have a place to call home. I had everything you needed for this place (driver's license, social security card, and mail that I picked up from my mother's house in which I physically don't sleep at but still get mail to and still consider my current residence.) No where on the website does it say anything about stereotyping, but they definitely did with me and that really shut down my "go out and get it" ego. As a 27 year old who is out on the streets with little to no help, because I don't like being helped I'd rather earn my money, it's hard enough getting up everyday trying your best way to survive by doing things that are legal like donating plasma, but after trying over and over to do right and getting turned down just to donate plasma which would in the log run help save a life, win win situation, I feel very hopeless now like why try so much to be turned down all the time. I had my head up high walking here from the trolley hoping to have money for the bus on the way back but now Im physically, mentally, and psychologically drained from this place. In conclusion, this place discriminates just the same as saying women can't be president, nothing different. Thanks for listening.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><name>lance christian<//name>< Time>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>It's almost like the staff hates their job so much that they'll shrivel up and die if they don't project it onto whomever walks in their doors.

Everyone is seemingly going through the paces, with the exception of maybe 2% of the staff. The disgust of dealing with the public is palatable.

They have 30+ beds for drawing plasma, never more than 10 are filled at any time.

The pay scale is shaded, the sign-in kiosks are dilapidated, and there is very little regard for the nuance of human interaction. You will be made to feel like trash, whether you're there to save lives or get yourself through the week.<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Although the wait is sometimes long, ESPECIALLY the first time, expect it to prevent being angry about it. It seems most of the negative reviews are from those that hate the wait or were rejected due to this place having standards which are completely reasonable. Long story short, don't expect to be in and out or assume you'll even be eligible.
The staff are mostly very friendly and I've had multiple pleasant small talks with them. (Shout out to Tony, Lily, Betty, and Minerva!)There IS one I don't like very much but shall remain unnamed :)
The establishment is very clean

The things I dislike:
-the annoying guy they play almost every time on the t.v. in the waiting area describing what they do and how you're a hero. Not that he's wrong but watch it once and you'll know what I'm talking about. Bring headphones or you're wait will feel longer.
-the temperature is kept at about 0°C (freezing). I believe it's for preservation reasons but still lol. If you're sensitive to cold BRING A BLANKET.

well that's all I can think of. Despite the negatives I still give this place 5 stars due to the good it does, the friendly staff, and of course the extra money in my pocket< /Review>

Tried going there to donate after finding out that they offer more compensation than Octapharma only to find out that their employees are too incompetent to file descriptions of my 5 tattoos, all of which are well over a year old. Apparently they have no way to keep photo documentation, so employees are required to describe donors' tattoos in detail, which posed no issue at Octapharma, but I was turned down simply due to laziness.
After reading previous reviews and my personal experience, I can only imagine that what happens in the front reflects what goes on in the back and I would recommend going elsewhere to donate.< /text>

I've been coming here for awhile & this is the WORST plasma place i EVER been to. Their racially bias, all the hispanic workers do is call the mexicans. So if you're hispanic you should love this place. I set a appt & im still waiting a hr & I get called after people who just pop up. Their system on picking individuals to be called is very flawed.<//Text>

< Review>
I strongly advise not to donate plasma here. I tried to donate on Friday April 20th, 2018. The phlebotomist got me started on the plasma donation and I felt like I was having a reaction and very weak to where I wanted pass out. I told the phlebotomist I wanted to stop the donation 4 times and he said no each time. It states in the rules that I can withdraw from the procedure at any time!! I will be filing a lawsuit against Scantibodies!! You will regret it if you donate!!! Will be posting this review everywhere else to let people know< /Review>

<text>Clean, nice people, wifi but no internet connection. Arrived at 12:30 left at 3 after being told I don't qualify due to a question. I'm sure there is a reason for the policy but the question "have you ever been with a man sexually EVER...EVEN ONCE" i feel is an unfair question to de-qualify you. It says answer honestly....not if you need/want to get paid</text><Resp>None<//Resp><Rating>1<//Rating><user_name>Bryan Harris</user_name>< userid>

This used to be the best plasma facility in sd but the record keeping in regards to your pay outs is broken.  The burden of proof falls on you if you have a complaint about the fact you were not paid what they owe from the machine.  The referral program is also unreliable and staff avoid recording there fact you were referred unless you physically bring someone in yourself.</text>

I had called to set up an appointment as a first time patient and the lady sounded like the had the phone in her mouth. She was very hard to understand and English clearly wasn’t her first language. She seemed to be getting upset that I didn’t understand her and hung up on me. I didn’t even get to make my appointment.<//review>

<Review>Customer service at this place is an absolutely horrible miserable experience! Personally, I think these people are racist. Seems that way if you're white. If you're white and gas money is what you're trying to get here, don't waste the gas you have going to them. Being perfectly healthy and they still come up with every excuse they can to turn you away.< /Review><UserId.>115460083079132673407< /UserId.>< pics>

<gmapID>0x80d958533fd6e267:0x18df514ded84b260< /gmapID><review>2 reasons why I'm only giving 2 stars. #1 I find it disgusting that the equipment from some one just donating don't get cleaned up rite away. For example, I come in to only sit next to some ones used machine with wires all intact still...gross and unsanitary. #2 my APPOINTMENT was at 10:15 and here I am waiting to get poked at 11:32.... This is the LONGEST wait I've ever had at a donation center.
Update: Sept 28th 2017
I'm honestly considering going back to octapharma. They are just as clean but sbi is nicer. But the wait time is unbelieveable. Especially having a appointment, you still not actually in giving plasma untill 2 hours later. Its insane. They have 5 deskes open for the finger prick and only 2 checking in while other employees look like there bored and stupid. The only reason I come here is because it's closer to home but after this appointment, I'm going back to octapharma< /review><Date>1506613811469< /Date><UserId.>117487611107514588442</UserId.><name>Faith, Benjamin and Kaleb Medina<//name>< Pictures>

<Review>So where to begin. Left my car to take shuttle bus from san ysidro to El Cajon save some gas. It turned out to be an all day adventure. I'm new to this facility yes it's clean but it's so slow I checked in at San Ysidro at 1130 got signed in by 1209 started process of check in its now 1325 and was in informed can't donate because I go thru octapharma my donation day is today there but can't donate here till Monday so just left now stuck in El Cajon waiting for shuttle back to my car hopefully not to long so I can get to octapharma ... so for my readers clean yes staff personable but so slow set yourself up for all day trip ....<//Review>< Pictures>

Staff is friendly and not to mention they have a shutel bus to sanysidro. If you reside, in south bay. This is a super advantage. On top of all this its a clean environment. Vending machine are extreamy cheap for those who have the munchies. And if you find yourself complaining... Well shame on you because it is free money. Just keep in mind to make pleanty of time for your first time, it could take up to 4 hours</Text>

I arrived at 9:50am with a friend  turned in all my paperwork and was not told that my POA was not acceptable till 12:45. Then they decided that they would accept it but didnt tell me this until 1:30 when I went back up to ask a question. THEN they decided to register me, pricked my finger and marked me and at 2:20 when I finally saw a Dr was still turned down because of a surgery I had back in 1997. Complete waste of time AND Gas!  They seem to be making so many changes that they are dropping the ball on training and basic screening process.< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I had never had any problem with scantibodies since they have always treated me very well and they are kind, the problem is that last Wednesday I made an appointment for transport and to donate today on Saturday and when I arrived it was my surprise that it did not appear on the transport list and consequently I could not attend and I lost my appointment. The "call center" does not recognize that it is wrong and I do not schedule my transportation. I realized today that they were also wrong with 3 other people who also missed their appointment. This is very unfortunate. Pay attention to that, there are many people scheduling and they are wrong to schedule and worst do not recognize it. I already lost my tomorrow and maybe no action will be taken about it. Very bad attention Julio learn from this and surpass yourself.

Nunca habia tenido ningun problema con scantibodies ya que siempre me han atendido muy bien y son amables, el problemas es que el miercoles pasado hice cita para transporte y para donar hoy sabado y al llegar cual fue mi sorpresa que no apareci en la lista de transporte y por consecuencia no pude asistir y perdi mi cita. El "call center" no reconoce que se equivoca y no programo mi transporte. Me di cuenta hoy que tambien se equivocaron con otras 3 personas mas que tambien perdieron su cita esto es muy lamentable. Pongan atencion en eso, hay mucha gente agendando y se equivocan al agendar y lo peor no lo reconocen. Ya perdi mi mañana y tal vez no se tomen acciones al respecto. Muy mal atencion Julio aprende de esto y superate.< /Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Terrible experience, they take too long and the nurses are bloody and do not know how to inject, they only hurt you and they no longer want to pay you for any little thing!

Terrible experiencia, tardan demasiado y las enfermeras son sangronas ni saben inyectar nomas te lastiman y ya no te quieren pagar por cualquier mínima cosita!</text>

<text>Bought a rear axle off a low mileage truck in mid November. Oddly enough it only lasted 10 weeks, even though original lasted 200K. First thing they asked is when I bought it. When they found out it was still under warranty for 2 weeks they tried to convince me it was my transmission not working. The next guy I talked to on phone claimed I may have used the wrong gear oil. I did not. He also suggested I add limited slip additive and give it a couple weeks, just enough time to run warranty out. Of course I told them I wanted a refund, but when they found out I didn't have original receipt they said I couldn't take it back to them, even though I knew what vehicle and what date I purchased and had record of it on my card. Also they didn't have the returns with  receipt only policy posted anywhere in their business. Don't waste your money here, there are reputable national dismantlers that stand by their products.
PS
After Subways response I feel it is important to clarify. They did not offer to look at the part, I did not agree to take it in. They told me they wouldn't refund or exchange without a receipt. Obviously they can look up the purchase as they have stated in their response. But they choose to not stand by their warranty instead. You're reviews on good parts mean little. How you handle a warranty says alot about you.<//text>< Pics>

{'time': 1579278377086, 'text': 'Mr Ruiz:  our 4 1/2 stars from nearly 100 other reviews state otherwise. In addition, your review is factually inaccurate. After research, it was discovered that you purchased this item on 10/16/19, not mid-November. This equates to 30-days of our clearly stated 90-day warranty. Item #1 on our receipt clearly states: "1.  This  receipt must accompany all claims and returns."  Additionally, during your conversations with our staff, you once mentioned the the replacement differential was doing the same thing as your prior differential. Also, with limited slip differentials, it is imperative that the proper fluids and additives are used, which we were attempting to verify. And the last conversation was for you to remove your differential to bring in for evaluation, which you failed to do. Your warranty was in effect until 1/16/2020 (after the date of your negative review), but you chose not to cooperate within your warranty period.'}</Resp>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>I purchased a 2006 6.0 powerstroke engine from subway on 6/25/19. Had the engine resealed as stated for warranty purposes. The engine was professionally installed at a reputable shop in Roseville ca. I have since put 1771 miles on the truck since I got it back. It’s been having some drivability issues so I had it inspected thinking it was something minor. Upon inspection it was found that a lifter has come apart causing it to eat away the camshaft. I spent 3697$ on this engine that has only lasted 1771 miles. They basically told me sorry about your luck and thanks for your money on the phone today. I would recommend not buying anything from these guys. I wasn’t even asking for a full refund. Possibly just an exchange or something even though I have over 7k$ worth of receipts for parts and installation besides the initial cost of this junk engine. It still runs fine at this time once warmed up but the oil system if full of material from the camshaft. Once again I would not do business with these guys at all. What a huge waste of money.<//Review>< pics>

You were in need of a 20-plus year old plain steel wheel. One that is a bit odd and difficult to find. Our had a little surface rust. Which is common with steel wheels. Our $60 price, which we offered to you at $50, was the lowest price in greater Sacramento per our parts locator, with the next lowest price nearby being $100. We have since sold those wheels.

<Review>I was looking all over for a 2008 Dodge dually long bed in white. Subway had one and they sent pictures of it to my email for me to look it over. I liked it and wanted it so I called them back and we talked. I was going out of the country in a day so I offered to send them 1000$ Non refundable to hold it for me until my return. They agreed and I gave them my cc #. I called them on my return and I arranged a time to get the bed and they suggested that for an additional 100$ they would remove my bed and replace it with their bed and do it all right there while I waited. I worried how I would do what they offered to do in my yard and without a crane and decided for 100$ to let them do the swap. Best $ I ever spent. Once there I also found a rear bumper for the same truck and bought it also. They installed it too. What nice folks. Since then, I have continued to call them for other parts and also for a 12 inch x 12 inch bed floor to patch a hole in another bed that I have. They always seem to come through even with odd or strange requests. I will go nowhere else but to Subway for future parts needs. Thank you Tony for your help and look forward to future purchases with Subway. If only all businesses could be so good to work with!<//Review>< Pics>

Found some hard to find lock cylinders for a Chevrolet Avalanche at a great price after Dave returned a email with 5 minutes of my request. Fast, efficient and easy people to talk to. I'm sure they will be shipped to Minnesota in the same manner as above! Added info 03-20-2016 : parts showed up better than described, fast even to MN and best of all no surprises or issues.... Thanks again Dave

< Review>
Went in to Subway Truck looking for some tires for my Ford F150 truck, asked for 265 75 17 tires, Dave at front desk told me he had 2, I went back to the yard to see them and 1 was a flat,  as I was walking back I saw other tires that I was interested in,  I asked Dave if he has other sizes that might fit,  he said no, (even though I saw them in the yard and there was also more in the show room).  I told him that I saw tires in the yard but he insisted he didn't have any,  he didn't want to double check or go back to verify. It seemed he wasn't interested in
making a sale,  i would not go back there again,  rude customer service. I don't recommend them.  Save yourself a headache.<//Review>

<text>DISHONEST THIEVES THIEVES THIEVES!!! So I called Subway Truck Parts for a Transit connect air cleaner box and talked to Brad, he said we have a complete air box. I go to pick it up, so while I was Robert brought out the air box complete. I also needed a fender that they had so me and Robert went to the yard to see the condition of the fender and when we got back in to the front desk, I see the air box is missing the air flow sensor with the torx screws left half way screwed in and I see the sensor with the same stock number as on the air box I just bought on the desk behind Dave (sales person) so I ask him "isn't this supposed to be complete with the sensor?" He says "No we sell them separately" I ask "isn't that one from my air box?" He insists "NO THEY LOOK JUST LIKE THAT" AND TURNED AROUND AND FLIPPED THE SENSOR OVER SO YOU CAN'T SEE THE SAME STOCK NUMBER AND SAID "WE HAVE ONE IF YOU NEED IT"
DEFINITELY WILL NOT TAKE MY BUSINESS BACK TO THEM!!!!!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

My names Carlos and I live in Illinois. After searching all the local yards here for a Cadillac Escalade roof rack all the yards were asking for way to much very expensive. I came across Subway Truck Parts online and they shipped me the Cadillac Escalade roof rack for WAY LESS than anywhere else. Final price was cheaper than anywhere else. I emailed with the owner (Brad) he always emailed back promptly. Very very helpful after all was said and done I received my part in 1 week and I am very satisfied. Will do business again price was so low I thought it was an error. Around here they want 300+ I paid less than half that. Thank you guys< /review>

Called at 11:30AM to check on a jack for a 2002 Ford F-150 truck.  After waiting for the party on the other end to check availability, he came back on the line and said they had it.  He asked me if I had $10, and when I told him yes, he said to come and pick it up.  I told him I would be there after lunch.  I arrived at the store at about !:30PM and told the person at the counter what I was looking for and he had to check stock, and ended up going out to the lot to get one. When it came time to pay, he requested $50, and I told him what had transpired with my phone call about the price, and he said they never sell them that cheap and wouldn't honor the price quoted on the phone.  I didn't have the name of the person that I spoke with (my bad), and no one in the place would say that they had spoken with me, so I left and won't return, and will tell all of my friends about the incident.  A true case of bait and switch.!!!</Review>

After looking around in Rancho Cordova dismantler for a specific a/c control unit and having no luck, I came across Subway Truck Parts online. I called and they had the part I needed at a really good price. Every time I order from them, they always have the best deals. I will definitely contact them when I need parts.<//Review>

After searching for platinum escalade esv side step for few weeks i head no luck than i called Subway Truck Parts and Jeff sold me exactly the part i need it and even matched the color so no need to paint it. What was even more impressive is that the owner left his desc and went to the yard to find and show me the part, what a pleasant experience . Thank you Subway!!!   I will always call you guys first.

They have a huge selection on website, but a part what I looked for wasn’t in stock. website said the part in stock. fix you website and keep it update, please. I waste my time.< /Review>

<text>Great price and really tasty bowls. It is located in LAB Antimall.
The ingredients seemed to be very fresh. The only thing they were not sure if the fish they have wild caught or not..
The place is clean and has a great vibe.
I'll definitely stop by here again next time I'll be in the area.<//text>< Pictures>

This is a pretty decent poki spot. They are pretty generous with the topping. For example, Avacado is included with no extra charge. Fish quality is decent. Portion is good. Probably would come again. The parking is free valet parking.< /Review>

One of the best poke bowl joints i’ve been to. Generous servings (way too much for me) and very fresh ingredients with really good selection of sauces. Location is convenient, just a 5 minute drive from South Coast Plaza and walking distance from Mitsuwa japanese supermarket. Highly recommend this place< /review>

This is my favorite poke spot.  The fish is always on point,  and the servings are generous. I love the octopus here. The toppings and sauces are pretty traditional (not as wild as some places),  but the end product is exactly what I want.</Review>

<Review>Healthy poke bowl place that offers a variety of toppings at no extra charge... unless you get extra scoops. They don't charge for avocado! They have a really high rating on Yelp, but I'd probably go to another poke place instead as their sauces lack flavor< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEwLn2S1tmCC4sZwbZJZb48bHiPJnWfL61nkCb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

I love this place! The fish always is good quality and the sauces are supreme. I have a tendency to mix my sauces together, I typically like the original house sauce, with spicy miso, and roasted jalapeno teriyaki. So yummy!</review>

<GmapID>0x80dcdf1bcfc160eb:0x3afdd224638f2d7c<//GmapID><review>To be honest, I came here because on Yelp I saw that if you came and wrote a Yelp review, you would get 50% off your next poke bowl, but sadly that deal does not exist anymore.

I got a regular bowl with three fish, but the bowl size was much smaller than other places and was kind of disappointing. When I came, there were only two workers working to serve, so the line was rather slow even though it was super short. By the time I got to pay for the order, two more workers had come, but I have to say it was disappointing to see the line move so slow. After the line cleared, the number of workers went back down to two. Can definitely see this being a problem later on.

In addition, while ordering my bowl, they ran out of ingredients and had to wait for people to make more. Definitely felt they were short-staffed. However, I was very happy I didn't have to pay more for toppings and avocado like some other poke places. Taste wise, it was fine, just like any regular poke bowl.

Parking was a struggle because it is located in The Lab: the Anti-Mall plaza.

All in all, it was an alright experience and I've definitely had better for the same price. Wouldn't go out of my way to come back again, but also wouldn't mind if I did.</review><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

The place here has fairly standard poke.  I really like the wasabi mayo sauce.  I think it gives a good kick without being overwhelming.  The large size is very hefty and would definitely fill you up.<//review>

The food quality is great. They do charge for adding extra of anything. Parking is extremely challenging during peak hours. If you get the poke salad with the original sauce, that could fit almost any diet (except original sauce has soy sauce which has wheat)<//text>

I really liked the Anti-Mall---a strange whimsical place for shopping and dining. The poke was very good but the toppings were a bit limited to what I've seen from other places. The yuzu pepper sauce was my sauce of choice. I was very happy to see that the price was under $10, while I have been used to paying $12-$15 for similar bowls at other places.</text>

<Text>Nestled deep inside "the lab" Calipoke draws loyal regulars.  3 or 5 smaller scoops will be fresh with a lot of poke variety.  Seating will be easy fo find, as this isn't the place to spend more than 15 minutes refueling.  You won't feel stuffed, but will definitely be content.</Text><pics>None</pics><Name>Daniel Harbatkin<//Name>< userid>

Pretty typical poke place, similar to all of the others starting to pop up. Only difference was avocado and crab are included in the price (at no extra charge). Mine was a little bland and my tuna still slightly frozen on the inside which led to every fourth or so bite having an off-putting, biting into a popsicle-like sensation. If a group of coworkers or friends was going I'd definitely join them, but wouldn't go out of my way to visit this particular place, especially due to the terrible parking over at The Lab.< /text>

<Review>Calipoke is my favorite poke place in the area and that's really saying a lot because there's quite a bit of competition for poke in Orange County. I always have a good experience at this restaurant but today was exceptionally great which is why I decided to leave this review. There was one girl and one boy working and they had me in and out of there in less than 5 minutes. They greeted me very politely and were just so pleasant. They asked me all of the questions that I presume they are told to ask but it didn't feel like they were reading from a script. On top of the excellent service the food is incredible. When I tell people about this place I like to say that it's a great place to go to when I need a sushi fix but don't want to spend a ton of money. Highly recommend this place!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<review>This is a great pokeplace. It's one of my favorite spots in OC. Their portions are great and their food is always fresh. It's unfortunate that their parking situation is so bad. If you're looking for other great places with better parking then check out Poke Sushi in Orange, and Pokenometry in Anaheim. 👍<//review><Name>Christian Hammad< /Name>< resp>

All these cookie cutter poke places are starting to feel very Chipotle if you know what I mean. If you don’t I’m saying they are vanilla, bland, unauthentic. Does that mean they aren’t good? NO. In fact they make tasty items. For rea mah broddah.

Most people who have been to Hawaii have never had poke the way Hawaiians eat poke. We grow up with this notion of Waba Grill and Flame Broiler where everything needs rice and veggies and protein. Poke when made for events a side dish, when eaten personally it’s a meal, but they don’t garnish it like all these places do. Poke is really more of a seafood salad. Poke came from workers on the dock cutting fresh fish scraps and mixing with local ingredients. They didn’t get the choice cuts, but when it’s fresh you have very little taste difference with all the sauces and seasoning they use.

What’s great about each new poke place is they doing slight variations. Like this place offers free seaweed salad (wakame) the very traditional Japanese salad we all recognize. They use biodegradable bowls, so they are trying to be environmentally forward and conscious. The rice stick, so my notion of salad is sounding a little more understandable, right? They currently offer a combo upgrade with miso and a drink with check in/review (though I think this is a limited offering).

They offering your standard fish like tuna, salmon, but what I really like is the scallop. I wish they had inamona (kukui nuts), offered oyster sauce, had limu, ogo or any other seaweed offering (not just wakame, nori, furikake). I like the avocado and garlic chip offerings, but the crab was bland and without sauce a detractor. Wish they had sambal chili offerings and were more authentic, but that’s slightly different. The salmon and yellowtail are consistent and fresh. I like that they offer ginger and that it’s so customizable. The sauces are a little tame, so err on the over side when asking for sauces. Their hot sauces also do not have much in the way of heat, if that’s your thing. I wish they had more citrus based or sauces with citrus notes. I like getting my sauces and seasonings on the salad and rice and not on the fish so much.

It’s not that busy, decent amount of seating, clean décor, unmuddled with decorations. Staff is friendly and you can get as much of the sides as you want, but the fish is a little lacking in amount. I like to get my poke salads with a quail egg or oysters, but no one around here really offers both at a “poke” spot, just Japanese places with a poke item. Value is on par with other poke in the county, that is to say slightly overpriced. I’ll come back because it’s the nearest place to my work if I need a fix, wish they kept the old menu and did poke as a split because a fish only offering would be a great snack to go along with their old menu. I really like the octopus.

The wave is upon is and “authenticity” is not something the masses care about, just me. Come get your Lab Poke here. I gave up on ranking poke places, they are all good, the value is always going to be a point of contention. Socal Poke is almost not even Hawaiian anymore. It’s interesting that most places at the lab are good, but not great, really lacking a few things and this is no different.</Text>

This is another build-your-own poke (BYOP) bowl place that has the formula for poke down to a science.  The portion sizes here are good and so is the fish. They also give you a few free extras that other places charge for, like seaweed salad and other toppings to go with your bowl.

In any case, here is the process: choose your base (white or brown rice, salad, or chips); then pick three or five scoops of sashimi to be piled on top (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, scallop, octopus, etc.); then sides of imitation crab and avocado; then finally various toppings including green onions, masago, wasabi, ginger, and garlic chips.

They have many different sauce options, including the standard soy sauce, spicy mayo, and others.  I was able to mix sauces here, which was excellent - other places don't always let you mix sauces for some reason.  Like my tip said, adding ponzu to the spicy original makes it pop.  It's really good.</review>

I wish they had more toppings and were not so  opposed to put a lil "extra" of a topic without telling you right away that there is a cost associated with it.< /Text>

<Text>One of my favorite poke places, however, parking is terrible around lunch and dinner times due to sharing a small parking lot with the rest of The Camp. And around 5 pm, half the spots are coned off for valet parking< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I've been here 3 times and the first two times were great, I had this younger lady do thread my eyebrows and I wish I could remember her name. But she did a great job. This last time I went in and it was awful. I wrote down my name and number and waited in my car because usually they ask you to wait outside until they call your phone. I waiting for 50 mins and finally decided to go in and see if maybe I put down the wrong number. I went in and looked at the check in paper and saw that they were taking in customers that signed in after me! They crossed my name off as well. So I told the lady I have been waiting outside for almost an hour and that I thought I was supposed to get a call. She was rude and didn't apologize. Instead acted like I was in inconveniencing her! She then took me and did my eyebrows in a rush. Didn't ask me how I wanted them done. She took off way too much and tweezed the beginning of my eyebrows and made me bleed. I was so upset because I got them done for my engagement pics and had to use more makeup than usual to make them look better.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

If I could get my eyebrows done elsewhere I would. Unfortunately, this is the only place open in my area right now. The employee asked my friend to wait outside even though we were the only two people in the waiting area. On top of that, she argued with me when I explianed to her that they should change their store hours online to reflect their new store hours.< /review>

Fast, friendly, reasonable price. Did my eye brows the way I wanted. She greated me and asked how I wanted my brows I showed her a picture of the shape I wanted. She asked if I like them thick or thin I said medium she did exactly medium. I'm shocked someone actually did them the way I wanted. I will become a regular!</Text>

This was my second time here, and I absolutely love this place. Both times, Geeta took care of doing my eyebrows, and she did an amazing job!   Great place to get your eyebrows done! I love how she always does my eyebrows I would highly recommend to come check out this place..</text>

Lady was really nice and so was the place. I feel she messed up my eyebrows i do have a mole on my eyebrow so i understand its a little more difficult to shape them but i literally had 5 months of growing eyebrows to work with. Im also bleeding in about 3 places because she took a couple pinches of my skin off. and 8$ was NOT worth it ive always paid 5$ ans got way better results</Text>

Place is nicely stocked. Only reason for 1 star is the owner/manager who is a mean aggressive rude lady. Learn to be more pleasant towards your customers.< /Review>

<Text>Dean's is a great little market that has very good prices on many, eclectic produce, canned goods, fresh foods and more. They also have a deli. The quality of the produce us usually very good, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. My only wish is that they had more organic items, both in the produce section and other goods. I really appreciate this business and try to visit at least once every week or so.< /Text>< date>

Great small store that has most of what you need. We always go there for seasonal fruits as they are very good quality and ripe. They also have Dean's Produce in Millbrae and that one seems to have more variety on some food categories.< /review>

I really really really love Dean's produce! Small little neighborhood grocery store with a good amount of healthy lifestyle options and great pricing. I only go here for all my produce. Cheaper than competitors. The only negative thing i can say is if you buy organic berries expect to eat them the same day or following morning. Every time i get berries they are bad after 24 hrs. Its okay i still love this place and they have friendly owner and staff!</Review>

<text>Similar to late Milk Pail of Mountain View. My new favorite shop for groceries.

Good variety of fruits and vegetables with imported European foodstuffs at affordable prices.

For non-produce groceries, it is a 5-star.
For fresh produce, it is a 4 star for variety, but everything is perfectly ripe. So don’t expect Berkeley Bowl-type selection.< /text>< Pictures>

Almost always has fresher, cheaper and more of a selection of produce than a store such as Safeway. The parking is very limited in front but try the more accessible parking in the rear, which is also a good place to park your bike. I often don’t see the price of an item I want and must ask about the price during check out. Mini deli inside as well.</Review>

I love shopping at Dean's. Their fresh fruits and vegetables are terrific. They are so busy that all their produce turns over very quickly. Plus, they have high-quality imported products I haven't found elsewhere. An example is: I love this particular brand of honey, I haven't found anywhere else, that's soooooo good. Yum</text>

<text>Great for inexpensive produce that always looks nice and fresh, plus a few other things. Dry goods like rice, beans pasta and lentils. Milk, eggs, some deli meat. Imported sweets. Olive oils. Jam. Jars of veggies. Dolmas. Sardines and other canned fish. Honey. Some breads and pita.

Cheese selection is mostly ethnic and most cheese you might expect to find in a typical American grocery won't be found here. It's been cool to try some of these that I have never seen before.

The only thing that I stay away from is the shelf of snacks in clear plastic tubs. The twice I tried anything from there, both times the items were already rancid.<//text>< Date>

Dean's San Mateo is a "must place to stop" for vegetables, fruits, and another's items. Dean's prices are unique at this site as well at the Milbrae store. Great quality of vegetables and fruits really hard to find in any store around San Mateo. Seasonal fruits are always display at the store. Highly recommend to stop by at Dean's Produce. Enjoy the visit!!!!!< /review>

<Text>One of three terrific groceries in a 2 block area on 4th Ave, Dean's has a great selection of produce, nuts, and dried goods, a wide variety of Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, and Central European-styled foods, and other items that don't overlap much with offerings from other nearby stores. The large selection of inexpensive spices is particularly pleasing if you are tired of tiny $7 bottles from McCormick. There's even a great assortment of flours and grains from Bob's Red Mill.<//Text>< pictures>

Very competitive prices, fun selection, excellent produce, and in a downtown location. I’m regularly surprised by the prices. Nice, clean place.
There is also a convenient back entrance that leads to the parking lot across from Central Park.< /Text>

High selection of produce, very quick and easy to go in, grab produce, and get out.
Avocados are usually just ripe enough for use the same night. Tomatoes, carrots, and onions have all been good quality here so far. Would buy other produce here, will shop there again.</Review>

Dean's offers amazing deals and hard to find items. Their produce is always fresh and delicious, good selection of local products and cheeses. But the best selling point is their large selection of imported items at very low prices.  If you love to cook this is a great place to find higher quality low price spices and imported oils.< /review>

Great prices and interesting selection of European and middle Eastern products.  Careful of the fruit, I have had apples, nectarines, yam and avocados that looked good on the outside but were rotten in the middle. Probably better to stick with produce in season.<//Text>

My new favorite gem.  They carry salted cod at a dent price that is hard to find anywhere on the Peninsula.  Lots of fresh produce and middle eastern world treats.< /text>

The vegetable are really fresh and they have vast verity of fruits too. We walked in just for checking the store first time since we moved to San Mateo recently only to end up purchasing our weekly grocery.
They also have indian masalas from some brand which saved us a trip to Indian store and they are priced reasonable. Counter service is pretty fast so we don't have to wait too long.

Only problem is being little cramped and lack of trolleys (both could be related).</Text>

< Review>
Lots of healthy organic items in this small market. Great for those who wants a local family market rather than a giant chain. Sometimes their prices (especially for organic food) is the lowest that I can find in the bay area. For example $1.99 for organic driscol strawberries while its $3.99 at trader joe's and $4.99 at whole foods. They carry a lot of spices and oils of just about every variety.</Review>

Dean's produce is a unique shop thats like an international market and produce shop combined. They have tons of international foods from various ethnic backgrounds.

I like buying the locally produced honey from them, locally produced honey is best for fighting allergies.

The prices are pretty reasonable, and the quality is pretty high, though you can find better prices for some things at the mexican supermarkets.</text>

<Review>Can't make it to the Saturday's College of San Mateo Farmers Market? Go to Dean's Produce. They have a vast organic and  conventional fruits and vegetables selection. I like that they sell Asian veggies that I can pick and choose from. Seasonally they carry lychee, variety of mangos and papayas. Nothing is pre-bagged. They also have a cool olive bar to choose from. They also carry Russian, European, Mediterranean food stuffs. Lots of different breads, chocolates from all of over the world. And the best thing of all everything is reasonably priced!< /Review><Name>Karen V Chin< /Name><UserId.>108453675463629554167</UserId.>< rate>

< Review>
Part of the City's network of privately-owned public open spaces, Maritime Plaza is a large lawn on the top of the complex's parking garage. Stairway entries from both Clay and Washington Streets. To the north, a pair of bridges span Washington Street and permit access to the Golden Gateway mixed-use residential development, which also includes publicly-accessible passive open spaces with views of the nice modern architecture from the mid-1960s.<//Review>

The setting was lovely and soothing. I experimented with black coffee and bread. The coffee was delicious. The bread is sweet and fluffy, and there is even toasted and flaky bread, but it is all delicious. I wholeheartedly recommend this establishment.< /Text>

This bistro was proposed to me by my neighbor. Thus, I went here yesterday to have some espresso before I went to work. It brought me joy and unwinding by the presence of the spot. It was truly sweet when I drank their espresso, which I generally preferred the most. So in case you're worried or need a rest, go to this coffeehouse!<//Text>

Among the remainder, you are the best! What I like about this coffee shop is that when it comes to coffee and pastries, they've really got my taste. It's not so sweet, and it's just perfect. You deserve to be remembered by many! Expect me to give all my colleagues a recommendation for your service and go here again. Oh, thank you!</review>

<Review>Very disappointed. Order an americano coffee. Took then long time to prepare. They fill the cup with too much water. We asked for heavy cream (they said they have it) and gave us half and half. Not sure if this is worth $10 for just two cups of coffee. In addition, too much waste. For a cup of coffee they included an additional cup and a sleeve.< /Review>< userid>

Saw this coffee shop while in line across the street at Milk. Out of curiosity I stopped by to try their coffee and saw that their pastries. I bought their chocolate chips cookies, banana nut bread. The coffee was fresh and the pastries were fresh and delicious. Great service...<//Text>

I am actually addicted to their matcha latte. I think about it all the time. I have had one dozens of times and every single time it has been perfect. Never even a dud. That is impressive. I love you Lamill. (Also their pastries and breakfast sandwiches are great, too!)< /text>

This is where I intend to finish the majority of my paperwork. This location appeals to me because of its coziness and atmosphere. It was so peaceful and relaxed, and it wasn't too crowded. This is my absolute favorite spot on the entire planet! Strongly suggested!<//review>

Worth the wait! The line moved quickly too. Food is inexpensive but still quality. Spinach & Feta quiche was delicious, as were the sandwiches (especially the Chippewa). The sticky buns were pretty good but probably wouldn’t order again. My boyfriend and I ordered a lot of food (clearly) because we wanted to try so many things. After reading many reviews, I decided we HAD to try the Birds Nest. I don’t like grits or poached eggs but this meal changed my mind. It was very unique but still a great combination. I would definitely order again. So happy we tried this place!!</text>

Uh, cute and pretty. In a coffee house, exactly what you need. The decor is really relaxing, with a small little outdoor seating area. Glad you have them in the neighborhood.</review>

<Text>Loved this boutique! We were looking for famous LA things to do and found this highly rated cafe. We even noticed there was a parking lot in the back which made things ten times easier.
We got a vanilla latte with oat milk and a strawberry croissant and both were extremely delicious. My lattes are usually perfect when a little bit sweet with bitterness as the aftertaste. I can say, this really hit the spot.
The croissant was superb! I love a good pastry that's flaky and perfectly warmed up with my coffee. The vibes in there are super aesthetic, cute and posh! I felt so fancy sitting there eating my croissant haha. The atmosphere is calming and bright inside! Loved it.<//Text><time>1598493599855< /time><GmapID>0x80c2c73bc7571135:0x4f635800aafb2b34</GmapID>< Rate>

Cute space, locally owned and run. Supporting a great tasting and excellent service establishment close to Los Angeles in the outskirts of Glendale. Tea and fancy sandwiches with sweet treats. I saw a cute fancy kid birthday on the patio with prince and princess treatment. Locally made food. They even were accommodating to my finicky diet. Delightful tea space. "Please come back, this is YOUR home", so inviting to have such nice service and gratitude.< /Review>

This is my favorite coffee shop to visit. Freshly roasted coffee they can make with their own homemade coconut milk if you want. They have lovely staff, very friendly and helpful. You can get non-coffee drinks too. I love the place so much! Perfect!< /Text>

<review>Great atmosphere, excellent drinks, and friendly staff are a good combination for success! Add the commitment to serve and this is a venture I can endorse without a reservation. The drinks are fairly priced and you can certainly tell the difference in quality. I will definitely come back for another tasty coffee!< /review>< pictures>

I experienced a very ignorant situation at this location.  I’ve been walking my dog down this route and came across LAMILL .  I was very excited to have my cafe con leche.  I was very fortunate to have met the owner at the location at the Beverly center , very nice , and LAMILL , in my opinion has come very close to the taste of Cuban coffee.  We were very sad to see LAMILL leave the Beverly center , and you can only imagine my excitement to have come across the actual coffee shop.  On Sunday 02-07-21 at 7:10am, I placed my order for my morning coffee .  It was set to pick up at 7:20am.  I stood in front punctual , and when I realized the coffee wasn’t out , I approached the “pick up “ spot in front.  As I stood there , the Cashier came out and went directly to the 2 white men waiting at the register .  I didn’t say anything and waited to not come off rude and impatient .  He then turned , walked straight into the establishment and didn’t even ask if I needed assistance .  He was already inside when we made eye contact and I was sure that he was going to come out and ask  me if I needed help. As he was making the coffee just ordered by the two men waiting, an Asian man pulled over and made his way to the pick up spot.  The cashier came out with the two coffees and handed them to the two men that ordered , he turned around and asked the Asian man is he needed help .  At the moment it struck me , I was being discriminated against ,and I understand I’m not the average LAMILL customer but the cashier could’ve made everything less obvious .  I was very upset by the whole ordeal that I yelled out “hey I’ve been waiting for my order” and finally the cashier asked me for my order info.  I really couldn’t believe it.  I normally stay away from establishments such as LAMILL because I feel like I might encounter some sort of discrimination, but I felt comfortable to become a customer because of my experience at the Beverly center .  I will no longer be purchasing at LAMILL coffee and just wanted to share my experience so that, hopefully, LAMILL can take my experience to better train its employees on making better choices.  I did not get the cashiers name but he’s was tall, white , long blonde hair, with glasses.  He didn’t even apologize or spoke to me after handing me my coffee.  I didn’t drink it.</Review>

Great place for breakfast! Filling and great prices. I had the Eggetarian and it was really good! I would of like the poached egg cooked a little less but it was still delicious. My friend had the bird's nest and I tried the grits and they tasted great. Cute location, we got a table by the window and we could people watch. They also had seating outside. I would go back on my next trip to Savannah.< /review>

<text>**UPDATE** the manager was super responsive and genuinely concerned. I emailed him this morning letting him know I had read his response and just ordered again through Postmates. He made sure my order was perfect this time! I'm actually drinking a HOT salted caramel latte, and it's fantastic. I ordered the breakfast sandwich this time but have yet to try it. Not feeling like eating after my 2nd Covid vaccine yesterday. But, I'm sure it's good...it looks really good, and I hope to eat it later.

As I stated in my original review, the food and coffee is really good! Their roasted potatoes are probably the best I've ever had at a restaurant, and the bacon is really smokey, thick and crisp. Since they list the brand of bacon they use, I have gone online and will purchase it. It's expensive but worth it! Lastly, my latte was really good. Strong but not overpowering or bitter. It's about the same price as Starbucks, so I recommend going there instead, as Starbucks has really lowered their coffee standards over the past few years, in my opinion.

**Original Review** The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because their potatoes, breakfast burrito and coffee are actually really good...if you actually get what you ordered. I've ordered 3 times using postmates and have only received the correct order once. It was not a Postmates issue, it was an employee at LAMILL issue. The latest screw up that led to this review is I ordered 2 HOT salted caramel lattes. I was really looking forward to it, but what arrived was iced coffee. I double checked and I did not order iced coffee...I can't stand iced coffee...we don't drink it. So, I waited 45 minutes just to throw my coffee down the drain. I doubt I will order from here again, which is too bad because if you can get the correct order, they actually have great food and coffee.< /text>< Rate>

<text>The best with this coffee shop is they have books and magazines available for everyone who wants to read while having their coffee. They have accents, too, with the preparations for their food. They serve also pastries and bread. I had Croissant this morning partnered with my Latte. It was a perfect combination!</text>< Time>

<review>They do have quality control the entire process of their store, with their beans being prepared and roasted in their coffee roastery. They also make a large selection of quality teas and lemonades using their own syrups. When the coffee was served to our table, we do really expect a good taste of it and we're very happy that the taste was more than what we expected.  Something for everybody here!<//review>< Pics>

Californian food here - delicious. Nice location to meet with family. The bill was appropriate. If it wasn't far from my work I would come by more.</Text>

<Text>This coffee shop near me is one of the best places to get coffee. A bit pricey compared to other coffee shops but you get what you pay for.  Baristas know what they're doing and they're passionate about their craft. This coffee shop also is very well-known for its hospitability. I would highly recommend this place to everyone.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>It's one of the best places here in our town! The atmosphere is fantastic with an amazing, friendly staff. They would be able to serve us the coffee flavor that we wanted. I mean they could serve the desired taste that we wanted. I would definitely come again, and I will recommend this place to everyone!

This place is perfect!  The food was delicious, the venue is so pretty, and the owners are incredibly sweet and friendly, not only very accommodating but paid attention to food allergies.  These women make you feel pampered!  Would definitely come here again, especially for a special event like a baby shower or birthday party, or a fun lunch!</Review>

Crispy on outside. Tuna melt was amazing according to hubby. Fries were hot and flavorful. Bread for sandwich was delicious. The pastries in case all looked wonderful. I would have loved to try a croissant. All the food that was coming out from kitchen looked fantastic.<//review>< Pictures>

A cup of coffee with friends turned out to be quite an experience! We stopped at this coffee shop on the way into town for a coffee, saw the menu, and decided to drink. The service was good, the coffee was great, and the ambiance was excellent. I wish we could have returned for another coffee, but we are only here for a couple of days.</text>

<text>Their pastries (which are sometimes on the dryer side) and other desserts cookies are all just ok, but those are sourced from another place.  Service is attentive and standard. Tea, coffee, and espresso drinks are tasty and come out promptly.  Great quality so you get what you pay for. I'm meticulous about my chai tea latte a so I didn't love it, but it's not bad either. Just not my cup of tea.  Their breakfast burrito was surprisingly very tasty, has a nice little crunch from the potatos as well as great flavor.  But it's a great spot to go if you need coffee, ac, the option of indoor and outdoor seating with a nice ambiance so that's what you're paying for. It is clean and has a modern, upscale feel so it's great for meetings. That's what I keeps me coming back.  It's a treat.<//text>< pics>

I went to this shop yesterday because I was told by my friend that this is the best. Good thing that I came here and ordered coffee and food. The waiter was very accommodating and nice to me. Besides, the coffee and food that they served were delicious and OK. Eventually, this shop greatly helps my morning filled with energy and happiness. Thank you!</text>

Great atmosphere, amazing coffee; truly a necessity for every Saturday morning!This is a great stop for coffee when you’re in need. I loved the business and pleasure. It’s great to have three drinks in front of you on a Sunday morning. The staff is incredibly friendly and the atmosphere makes the experience even more memorable.<//review>

<Text>Cool space to hangout and grab a cup of Joe. When you first walk in you will be blown away by how large the space is. You will also see the menu written on the wall. I went with he Cold Brew and enjoyed it a lot. It had a nice taste and is super smooth. There isn't too much sitting room, maybe 20 seats total. We were able to sit in the hallway looking at the roaster which was cool.<//Text><user>112537946201941063844< /user><time>1582113080962< /time><rating>4<//rating></record></dataset><record>

One of the favorite local cafe. Best vanilla latte, mocha, milk tea hands down. Only down side is the very limited always full parking space. Their food is great also.<//review>

This is a very interesting place in downtown. I love trying new breakfast places so I popped in on a random Wednesday morning, no wait. The staff is extremely friendly, welcoming, and accommodating. I ordered the cinnamon French toast, it wasn't the best French toast I have ever had but it was good French toast for the price and environment. Good place to just come in and have a bite to eat, not gonna lie there is a lot of people watching to do in this place which makes it a little more appealing to me as well.<//Review>

It takes you a minute to find the place; it's pretty hidden. The area around the coffee shop is a dump, but the coffee shop itself is pretty cool! I was impressed when I saw that they process their coffee beans! It's excellent quality coffee, and the employees are pretty friendly.<//review>

One of the best Coffee Shops in LA, especially for students. For LA circumstances, this coffee shop is good arranged. The price list is good for LA and the staff is friendly at all times to me. It may be raff to find a table located next to an outlet.

What I like about this place is people come here to hunker down and work, so it is super conducive to getting stuff done. There are lots of tables spread out over three areas and a choice of patio or indoor, small, intimate table or long communal table.

The coffee is good, as is the music, which is just loud enough to notice, but not so loud it distracts you.

It's not the cleanest space, through. The first cup the barista offered me had a ring around it, so I asked for a to-go cup.<//text>

I can't say enough good things about this cozy neighborhood coffee shop.  The baristas are true coffee artists and put love into every cup they make.  The pastries are a must try, no matter what eating restrictions you normally put on yourself.  Also, the avocado toast is the best in town!</Text>

We were recommended to try their Da-Hong-Pao Chappuccino and Sri Lanka Ceylon Cha Latte by the friendly staff, WOW!!! We were blown away by how tasty the teas were. While most other tea places we've tried simply pour the pre-made tea and mix with whatever flavor cream or toppings, this place actually freshly make their tea, then mix in the add-on's. We can taste the real flavors of the tea, we also love the environmental paper cups! Will be back again for sure.<//Text>< response>

Cute little cafe tucked behind the corner. Their house made dirty Horchata is yum, and their flat white was one of the better ones I've had in LA. Bonus points for the great vibes and workspace set up for you to jump on your laptop and finish that report or paper due ;-)</Review>

Take it from some one that eats avocado toast every morning— this restaurant has the best avocado toast I’ve ever had in my life. This boutique is super cute, it has a great atmosphere and aesthetic to it. All of the workers are always super kind and helpful. The coffee is amazing, juice is fresh, pastries are delicious. Everything about this place is spectacular.< /text>

Their iced vanilla latte is simple amazing. One of the biggest reasons why I come here so much is that there's free parking downstairs! And it's such a spacious area with multiple outlets. Great to study and drink coffee! Their barista, Joseph, is really knowledgeable (he knows what he's doing!) and super friendly. I came here three times and he remembered my name.<//text>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>Oh Lamill, so pretty but so expensive. They include a 12.5 % “service fee” that you aren’t warned about and end up tipping on top of. No one knows where it goes... but the food, coffee and ambiance are great - and despite having paid over $12 extra for bacon & avocado on a breakfast sandwich i do still come work on my laptop here.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Oh so pretty. Why wasn't Silver Lake this awesome when we lived there! Probably because we'd spend tons of money and never eat at home. Food here is fresh and service relatively quick for fresh food. Parking is tight but managed to get a spot every time.<//text>

I had the black sesame latte with soy milk and it was very light in sweetness (perfect), had that distinct black sesame taste, and a subtle hint of espresso (decaf...I know, what's the point of decaf, right?).  Never had black sesame as a latte, but I would definitely order it from here again!<//Review><gmapID>0x80c2c73bc7571135:0x4f635800aafb2b34< /gmapID>< rate>

Great lighting for those who love great lighting. Employees are awesome, genuine, and respectful. And swift at that too! The coffee is delicious! The people nice and wise! 5 stars! One of the best coffee shops I’ve been to. Seats comfy, like I said also lighting. What else do you want? Haven’t tried the food so dont @ me. You got a lake near by too! Great spot!</Review>

<Text>Yummmmm. Came here Mother's Day Sunday and it was busy but we managed to be seated within three minutes or less. I got one of the specials with the pork chop and gravy. It was good and worth it! 14.50 for the plate but that is like one of the most expensive things there. Everything else is reasonably priced. Service was awesome. Will come back soon :) five stars from me.< /Text>< Pictures>

First off, if you the tall slender barista is in, you are in for a show. Her constant and non-stop banter with customers about pretty much anything is is both endearing and entertaining.

High quality coffee and brunch options here. Great location, parking in the back is a little tight but as walkable an LA cafe as you could ask for. Comfortable, clean and tastefully decorated dining area. I had a latte and tried a pourover, both were great. Avocado tartine is top notch. Friends ordered a traditional breakfast and the honey yogurt. The potatoes were really tasty! Also, the yogurt and/or the honey has a really nice orange blossom flavor that raises the bar a bit. Quite expensive, but recommended for a pleasant daytime meal.</Text>

Possibly the best coffee shop in Los Angeles. Great baristas, three different sitting areas. Great for meeting up with friends, for doing work, and for playing on the internet while pretending to do work.< /Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I write for a music and coffee blog called Crooners In Coffeeshops, in which I interview local musicians at local coffeeshops. My writeup reflects the positive experience that I encountered at LAMILL Coffee on our interview date.

East L.A. is chock full of adorable cafes and Lamill Coffee Boutique is by far one of the most spacious and versatile in terms of menu offerings. To start off on the visual aspects of the shop, Lamill commands attention from the moment you set eyes on its bright red exterior, and only exceeds your eye’s expectations with grand lighting fixtures, decadent golds mixed with rustic neutrals and pops of blue, and gorgeous black and white scenes along the walls.

Lamill’s food and drink menu is just as eye-catching as its visual appeals with an array of options for all. There is a clear focus on healthy, organic recipes with a fair amount of veggie-friendly and gluten-free options to choose from, including special seasonal items that are made to pique your interest. Their beverage menu consists of well-picked single origin coffee roasts, teas in every color, and beloved recipes. Like their food menu, they also offer wonderful seasonal options for visitors to enjoy. I myself was intrigued by the Honey Orange Cortado, and while I wish that they also had it in latte form, the little espresso cup certainly packed a flavorful punch.< /Review><name>Heather Allen</name><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< GmapID>

<Review>🍜 Food: nice selection of tea and coffee, you can also grab some pretty authentic European pastries or order a more consequent dish like a classic grilled cheese and tomato soup or a parmesan kale salad.

👩‍💼Service: order at the counter, which is a little surprising considering how upscale the place looks. The staff serving the food are always very nice, but I unfortunately always felt the counter employee to be a little snobby.

🏠 Atmosphere: something between kitschy and classic European boudoir that gives the space a very grand look, which is kind of nice and different for a place where most people bring their laptop.

Take it from some one that eats avocado toast every morning— this restaurant has the best avocado toast I’ve ever had in my life. This boutique is super cute, it has a great atmosphere and aesthetic to it. All of the workers are always super kind and helpful. The coffee is amazing, juice is fresh, pastries are delicious. Everything about this place is spectacular.<//Review>

Order at the counter and take a number. Coffee was ok, but they never brought my food. Nobody was clearing tables so even after going elsewhere for lunch, my number and coffee pot were still on the table where I had left them.< /review>

<username>Cayce Beckett<//username><Gmap_id>0x80c2c73bc7571135:0x4f635800aafb2b34</Gmap_id><Text>Amazing to read reviews here. "They have outdoor benches but not full tables FYI." Are people high or just vacuous?  They do have  'full tables' (what does that even mean?) but NO 'outdoor benches.'  Anyway, pour overs are tasty if you choose the right beans from their selection. Food is a tad expensive, but quality costs and its on par with the area. This is my local so its odd to me that tourists sometimes drive here. Guess its the occasional celebrity, but still, there are great coffee spots all over LA. Although, I CAN say that it opened way before all the imitators did and set the bar high. Worthy of a visit for the eclectic French decor and taking in the Silverlake vibe.<//Text>< rating>

A little overpriced but after a walk around Silverlake it's a nice place to stop for a bite and some coffee. It's conveniently located, clean, clean bathrooms, decent if not a little bit small parking area, and friendly staff. Vegan and meat friendly options available 👍 Had a generous amount of greens to go with my omelette and my brother's burrito 👍<//Review>

<review>Super pricey, but amazing spot. Delicious fresh breakfast options--- wish it was more affordable. $6-7 for a 12 oz almond milk latte is just too much. Although amazingly delicious. Love the atmosphere, and the decor. Quality is top notch, but just too pricey for me.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Rating>3<//Rating><user_id>102044146384749699357</user_id><date>1431158583522</date><gmap_id>0x80c2c73bc7571135:0x4f635800aafb2b34<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

By far the best coffee shop around. The quality of beans and light roast make for an excellent cup of coffee. I tend to go for the single origin coffees, which allow you to really taste the bean specifically. the food is also incredible here which is very rare for a Coffee Shop/ Cafe.< /Review>

LOVE Lamill. Great coffee and food. However, their bagged selection of coffee was very, very low and I did not have much to choose from to purchase a gift for a close family member, so I'm hoping the one that I chose will be one that he likes.<//text>

<Review>I don't recommend fried chicken sandwich. The sandwich bread get soked. The chicken was not white meat.   The brown meat smelled unpleasant. I couldn't eat half of chicken. Its waste of money.

The americano was  good.
The service (serving guy) was good.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

But either way. Like the feel of the place. The only thing I would note is that there is parking behind the place for just this place. I did not know that so I parked on the street kinda far. So I would keep that in mind of going on a weekend. And if you park on the street, pay attention to street signs before you accidentally get a ticket.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

This coffee is great - on the brink of too bitter, but delicious.  And, It's definable packed full with wake the hell up!  I always find it amazing that there is always such a long line in here.  Where do these people come from?  I wonder, if, like me they are traveling from a far (from Cagiest) to get this delicious coffee in the middle of no where.</Review>

This place is too pricy. I ordered an iced latter with non fat milk. They charged me "12.5% of service fee" of it. It's too much. I have never experienced like this in LA, even in NY.
If it was amazingly great coffee, I would never complain about it. But, seriously it's insane.< /Review>

<pics>None</pics><text>We end up at this place because the location is great. But the furniture is so strangely arranged and the chairs are oversized so it feels crowded and full even when there are only 10 people there. I guess what I'm trying to say, is that the food is lovely (expensive!! like, very expensive!)  but the space could feel much cozier with a few adjustments. Replace the arm chairs-at-table thing with regular wooden chairs and you could fit twice as many people and wouldn't have to deal with the constant bumping of people "sneaking" by you. At least half the tables are occupied by a single person on a laptop. If I ran the place I'd make some seating specifically for "working" guests. On e large table with a bunch of plugs etc.</text><Rate>3< /Rate>< Gmap_id>

The only beef (figuratively) that I have with this place are the food portions. You can't really get full (as a marathon runner) without buying triple of everything.

However, if you're on a diet, as people in LA are wont, then you get a really delicious sampling of food. The leek soup or the clam soup are standards here. Also, the flank steak salad is made with really fresh ingredients.

Best of all is the coffee. If you need to laptop camp and can keep up with buying a coffee every two hours, this place is for you. It's not crowded during the day on week days. I'm sure they'll love your business.</text>

<Text>It was OK. A cool place in a trendy spot to meet a friend and people watch. The staff were decent but the girl who took my order looked like she didn't want to be there. When gratuity is included (plus I tipped extra on top) the staff could at least try to appear as if they have some energy. The food was average, not bad but not great and the coffee was the same. I asked for it extra flat and it still had a ton of foam on top and was luke warm at best. Gave it 3 stars purely for the atmosphere, that's the only thing this place has going for it. $27 for a breakfast burrito and a latte. If it was outstanding it'd be worth it but it really wasn't.<//Text><gmapID>0x80c2c73bc7571135:0x4f635800aafb2b34< /gmapID><pictures>None< /pictures>< rating>

I loved my white sangria! My first experience with it was at #happy hour and it was $4 but anytime before that it's $8. It's delicious but definitely not worth that.  Especially when they pack so much ice inside that its the first thing that hits your lips!  The food I tried here overpriced and was not that great. The warm donuts look alot very than they taste!</Review>

I really want to love this place because the food and coffee are delicious, but the service was terrible.

Our party had to stop the hostess and wait staff to ask them to serve us for everything.
-Seating
-Taking our food orders
-Refiling our water glasses
-Delivering the check.

We had to waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaait forever before our impatience forced us to react.

If it was busy then i could have been sympathetic. but there were open tables everywhere.

Our waitresses demeanor was unfriendly and unwelcoming as well.

This isn't cheap fare either.

I won't say this place should be skipped, because the food is very very good.  However, don't show up hungry or in a hurry.< /Text>

A friend recently told me of a place on Silver Lake Boulevard called Lamill Coffee Boutique. So I decided to pay it a visit. When I got there, I was amazed, it was so stylish and had a unique take on what a coffee café should look. It does serve tasty and high-quality coffee. I had some of that. I also found out that they serve tea. Now if I want to have some coffee or tea at a stylish and unique place, I know where to go – Lamill Coffee Boutique.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

I didn't feel like this was a coffee place. I felt like it was a brunch restaurant. The name seemed misleading. They had a good coffee menu, with a large selection (various beans, brewing techniques, etc.), but I definitely felt out of place with my laptop ordering just an iced green tea and cinnamon roll, which were good if pricey. The brunch food at other tables looked good. Wait staff acted like I was an inconvenience and didn't seem interested in serving me, but it wasn't like there weren't open tables. Other people on google+ are reviewing this as a place they just go for coffee. If that's the case, I don't get the wait staff's attitude.< /Review>

They should call this place “for here or to go” because after coming here twice a week for five years, that’s the only thing they’ve ever said to me. Guaranteed: slow, impersonal, sloppy service. No one behind the counter knows what's going on. Only thing keeping it afloat in a sea of great coffee houses is a lucky location.<//Review>

Ok this is a MUST VISIT site. The velvet blend coffee is some of the smoothest tastiest coffee I've ever tasted.... and I don't drink coffee! My wife loved the taste and I even enjoyed the sip I stole. We had the donut holes which were warm and delicious cro-nut tasting clouds of taste bud tantalizing heaven. Served with a whipped cream these are amazing! Busy place but yet never felt like it, you still are able to slip into your own little world here. The servers were very attentive and beyond polite. Simply loved our visit.< /Review>

So expensive, but good food and coffee. Good people watching. Don't know if it is just me, but find the chairs super uncomfortable. People love working here.< /Review>

Its a very small or "cozy" place... The food is good but I was expecting a little more of a portion for the price. Not a bad place tho and definitely a good place to stop and grab coffee in the morning!</review>

All the Lucy items excellent. But it's a coffeehouse folks. In that they excel. Choose your own form of coffee preparation whether it's press, clover, vacuum...your choice. But leave room for the Affogato!</review>< pictures>

By far the best truffles i have ever eaten.They are around nickel to quarter sized, made fresh daily and they have around 20 or so different flavors.  I had a free second to talk to the chef and he says he never stops experimenting with different flavors.They even have vegan truffles.The red wine and the white chocolate are my favorite!</Text>

<Review>They started adding a service charge here to help pay the bussers and people cooking food etc. Instead of putting the service charge on the customer maybe pay them higher wages instead? They are already charging an arm and a leg for their bland coffee. Do I really need to help them pay their own employees? Isn't that why I'm being charged $5 for coffee that costs about $1 to max $2 for materials and labor? The labor is included in the cost of their items. Smart way to increase their costs to the customer by saying that the service charge is for their employees, but when you think about it, it should be included always and just should tell the customer the total charge price instead of sneakily adding a service charge. Very deceitful. Never going here again!<//Review>< pictures>

I'm actually a fan on the service charge because it takes the guess work out of tipping. Lamill has very fair coffee prices and rad people who work there.

***This is the first time I’ve ever reviewed a place. Service was pretty bad. Not a friendly group. The food is over priced. Not worth it. Unless you like coffee. Save your money and grab a bagel somewhere else. Feel bad about posting this, but they did me wrong.<//Review>

Such a very nice and unbothersome place for coffee, a great reprieve from to-go only shops and seen-and-be-seen cafes. And of course, the coffee's great and the service is restaurant-level. Great place to settle in for a long caht or to get some reading/work done<//Text>

Milk fascists. If you have milk allergies, sensitivities or think an iced matcha would taste gross with whole milk don’t come here. They also only do an iced chai with whole milk- I used to love the chai here and would drive across town to get a few. but will throw up now if i have it. what a bummer! Change this and i’ll go back to loving you lamill and give you five stars. aka milk blackmailing you #sorrynotsorry</text>

<text>I live here even though I have a Nespresso machine at my house. I find my self here at least once a day grabbing a dirty chai and then chatting with the staff. This truly is a great neighborhood staple.

Would recommend Lamill to any one and every one I know. Great for any accusation. Be it a meeting or date night.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Pretty solid coffee spot, even if I can't decide if they are a coffee shop or a restaurant!

Heard about Lamill through the coffee grapevine and came in to do a little bit of work and sample their drinks. Had the espresso and a cappuccino. The cappuccino was pretty good- good milk, didn't overpower the espresso. The espresso wasn't anything to write home about, unfortunately. Crema was a little thin and it tasted just a tad bit sour. Nothing terrible, but it didn't strike my fancy.

Service was attentive, even though I had my head in my laptop 60% of the time. Pretty cool, shabby chic decor in a quieter part of Silverlake.

Three stars for now- can't wait to come back and try their food and get the whole experience!< /Text>

LAMILL is a very unique place and it's a staple of the silverlake neighborhood but I feel like there really could be a little more education on all the many many, and believe me there are _many_ ways they can prepare you coffee. Simply put, if there is some sort of obscure or historical/traditional/classico style of making coffee you know about or want to try, this is that place. However I think paying $13 for a french press that pours out to serve two small cups is outrageous and I'd rather stay ignorant and just go to Starbucks. But I am also inclined to believe that the typical person who would actually enjoy the seriousness that LAMILL brings to coffee would also chase me with a pitchfork for saying the S-word. C'est la vie!< /review>

<text>Orange Infused Cappuccino = Delish.
Pumpkin bread = meh.

I tried to order two different pastries but somehow they were out of all of them, so I settled for whatever was left which was the pumpkin bread. It was very meh.

Service was pretty good and the ambiance was fun and bustling. I really enjoyed the coffee despite the high price for the small cup.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

I go to Lamill pretty much on a daily basis. They make the best soy latte's in all of Silverlake. The staff is incredibly  friendly. Just started trying their breakfast and so far so good. Their egg benedicts are really tasty as well as their pastries. Their outside seating is preferable since their chairs inside are extremely uncomfortable unless you are sitting in a booth. Unfortunately the sit down service can be hit or miss. Of the several times i have been there for breakfast, the service was great all but one time. But that one time was so horrible that we felt compelled to complain to the manager. Hopefully they have taken care of this problem because its a great spot to grab a quick coffee or some breakfast.< /text>

Lamill Coffee is famous on Instagram and my two teenage daughters wanted to visit. I recently uploaded the review on my blog and found that their receipts has 10.5% Service charge BEFORE Sales tax(9%). Not to mention 10.5% Service charge on top of TO-GO order. I checked online and found "When this preset service charge or "mandatory tip" is added by the retailer to the customer's bill, it is subject to tax."
Is this place worth paying the mandatory tip and sales tax on top of it? Not to me.
They should not place a Tip Jar next to the cashier because they charge service charge on a to-go beverage as well.
There are tons of alternatives for Lamill in LA area with better food, pricing, parking and service.</Text>

< review>
LAMill reminds me of a fancy boutique hotel lobby, and I definitely mean that as a compliment. Great place to meet up for coffee/tea, or take your laptop and do some work on your own. It's usually pretty quiet so not the best choice for a big group dinner or anything. Another possible use for LA Mill: taking care of a Craigslist transaction like the laptop-purchase I witnessed in their sidewalk dining area, ha! A bit expensive ($6-9 for an individual pot of tea) but the specialty-ness of it all makes it worth that. Nice servers who aren't overbearing and street parking is usually available along Silver Lake Blvd.</review>

Honestly... I only bought something here because my friends wanted to get something from MILK, I needed a place to park, and you could only use their lot if you were a customer.

Strange place, Lamill. It's like... a sit down restaurant. Except it's not a restaurant? But it is? You have to seat yourself. And you can't get a pour over to go? But you can get espresso to go. And they have menus? I don't quite understand it. Whatever.

One of the best vanillattes I've had! Not too sweet and adequately creamy. The vanilla flavor wasn't too strong, but it was definitely there, so they have that goin' for them.

I'm super bitter about the prices though. $5 for an 8oz vanilla? Like. That's ridiculous. I've had my fair share of $5 lattes, but for an 8oz?? Really? My heart cried. I still bought it... but I probably wouldn't go back because of that.

(And this is pretty irrelevant but they have the coolest to go cups.)</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
Pretentious and expensive. Food is mediocre at best. You will need a new root canal after that first bite from the avocado toast.
If you order an omelet it comes with no bread, to order a side of bread that's an additional $4 for 2 pieces.</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is one of the spots that I do not want Japanese tourists to know. Hongkong milk tea is delicious. It's close to Griffith, so it's a good place to wait and relax at this restaurant from sunset.
There is a free parking lot (no time limit!) That can be stopped rarely in LA, about 8 cars, the WIFI is solid, the toilet is clean, it is too crowded and there is no seat at all, so it is a perfect cafe .

(Original)
日本人観光客には知られて欲しくないなぁというスポットの１つです。Hongkong ミルクティーが美味しいです。グリフィスに近いので夕焼け時からこのお店でまったり待ってというのにいいと思います。
LAでは珍しく8台くらい停められる無料の駐車場(時間制限ない！)があり、WIFIもしっかりしていて、トイレもきれい、混みすぎていて席が全くないということもないので完璧といえるカフェです。< /Review>< name>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>(Translated by Google) Many local people come here to buy breakfast and often have to line up. Came a few times and waited for about 3-5 minutes. The taste of the coffee was good. The waiter's attitude was not bad. He would come and ask if he needed any assistance. I chose to sit outside because the echo in the space inside is too large. The public security here is good, and the environment is clean, it is a pretty good place to stay.

很多當地的人會來這裡買早餐，也常要排隊。來了幾次，大概要等3-5分鐘，咖啡的味道中上，服務生的態度還不錯，會來詢問自己有沒有需要協助的地方。我選了外面的位置坐，因為裡面空間的回音太大。這裡的治安不錯，環境也乾淨，是個蠻好待著的地方。<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2c73bc7571135:0x4f635800aafb2b34<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>
