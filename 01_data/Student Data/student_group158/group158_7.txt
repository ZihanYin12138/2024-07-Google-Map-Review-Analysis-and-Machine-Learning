This rating is based solely on their service. They were great when I was making my purchases, but I didn't hear from after I made my payment of $5900.

1. The manager stated he would send me an email receipt. I never received one.

2. He said it would take three weeks, but most likely it would come before then. It took  three and a half weeks which I am not mad about it. However, I NEVER received a single call from them. After i called them on multiple occassions, were we able to decide on the date of shipment.

3. On the day of our shipment, the sectional was missing... I called them the day of bc we were suppose to receive the merchandise from 3 to 7. They came at 7:25 pm on a Saturday. When I called them the day of shipment, I didn't hear about about our sectional being delayed.

Ill never do business at wyckes again. I am stunned with their terrible after care service. We have guests coming this upcoming week with no sectionals to sit on. Thanks wyckes.

Edit: this is getting so ridiculous.. it just makes me laugh. We received a bedroom set without the bed frame... haha really?<//Review>

<text>Good spot for custom furniture in a variety of styles. The salespeople are not on commission, so there is no high-pressure selling here and they can tweak any of their designs to exactly fit your measurements, fabric choices, and other design criteria. Considering most of what they do are custom orders, the pricing is reasonable and the turnaround time is good.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Super friendly and helpful staff. Every person I dealt with was incredibly gracious and easy to deal with. I had a huge order and they patiently worked with me for several hours on several occasions. Can't say enough nice things about the employees!< /Review>

The gentlemen at Wyckes were extremely helpful and friendly in helping us pick out a custom couch. They are very willing to work with any budget and provide great service in their products. They weren't pushy in helping us find the sofa and gave us a great deal on a fully custom sectional</text>

Great prices and casual no pressure sales staff, we had a great experience!
The salesman was knowledgeable but the best  part is he allowed my husband and I to spend a lot of time in the mattress department laying on beds without pressuring us or bugging us.
After spending many hours trying to decide on which mattress we wanted we finally made up our mind. Ever since this mattress was delivered we have had much better sleep with no lower back aches, we couldn't be happier.<//review>

Worse shopping experience of my life. I bought some furniture from this store and changed my mind less than 24 hours later, and they said it would be a 30% restocking fee. That means if you my a $2000 couch, they don't even have it in the store yet, you have to pay $600 to cancel the order. Ridiculous! Ok, I guess I'll just buy it. Wait, there's more. The sales guy also said the furniture I bought would fit in my car, if I took it out of the box. What he didn't tell me is that it would void the warranty. Then it turns out that it doesn't fit in my car after all. So I was told the wrong information and wasted hours of my time and my hard earned money on this total scam of a store. Please do yourself a favor and shop at a furniture store that doesn't have terrible customer service and unfair policies.<//Text>

To start from the beginning, I don't leave a negative review, BUT I had to share my experience, which was earlier today, a recliner living room set was $1699 and underneath the total was a price for each piece, and here the associate/partner approached and ask whether I need help, and I made the unforgivable mistake by asking "what the $1699 includes?" I received the look of "are you stupid" and was told "what do you mean? Then, checking a bedroom set, and a mattress, asked for the total price, and a discount of $100 off all the purchase, the associate/partner said, I can't do it, then I added "can you think about it for a couple of minutes?" I received the same look, and he literally yelled at me and said "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?". Let's say, I am not smart, and made no sense, but this is not a customer service, our stuff was going to cost $3350, but I took my money to living spaces and got what I needed, was a great customer service. My advice to Wyckes Furniture, you are a small local store, and customer service is number one in a successful business...
Thanks< /Text>

I called Wyckes Furniture Fountain Valley and asked if they had the Norah Collection. Saleslady said they did not have it on the floor and I could order online. I have never ordered online but I had already purchased the same sofa and loveseat from Wyckes furniture before so I trusted their word and ordered online. Received furniture that looks nothing like my sofa and loveseat AND were DEFECTIVE!!! I emailed and called the Fountain Valley store within 48 hours and their store policy says refunds within 72 hours. Richard, the manager,emailed me and he said to take photos of the furniture with tags and send it to him and he will get back to me. I called the store several times,no answer, until finally Austin answers the phone I told him that I had received defective furniture and emailed the manager, Richard and he never called me back. Austin said that Richard was boarding a plane out of the country as we spoke and he couldn't call him or text him and he would forward the email to the owner Scott Smith and the owner would call me back. I waited another 4 days for Richard, the manager, or the owner to call me back. Noone called me or emailed me back.I filed a dispute with my credit card company.
Months later, Richard Carillo the manager at The Fountain Valley store offered to replace the defective furniture they sold me for another set of my own choosing. The results are pending our going to the store to choose the furniture.< /Text>

Thank you Wyckes Furniture for my power reclinging sofa set. Brandon and Austin were awesome sales associates they explained everything i needed to know about the set and let me be alone for a minute to try it out. They were not pushy at all. Definately coming back when its time to get my mattress. I read some of the other reviews to make sure that Wyckes was legit but like most of their positive reviews state they are indeed awesome. I didnt see any reason why they would havr negative reviews ither than maybe its not them but more that the consumer was picky. Thanks again Wyckes.<//text>

I had made an appointment because a bridge I had gotten 2 yrs ago broke.  Dr. Latham and his staff always make my experience there very pleasant.  As I was talking to one of his assistants she shared how much she enjoyed working there and said Dr. Latham is a man of integrity and is very kind.  I agree.  The atmosphere in the office is alway upbeat and stress free.  When paying my bill, he had made a generous adjustment, which I greatly appreciated since I am on a limited income.  I will be paying it forward.  Blessings, Joyful Betty</Text>

<review>The staff at Latham Dental is amazing, starting with the front desk where check in/out is friendly and efficient and where it's obvious they follow strict cleaning, masking and distancing protocols.
Ally is the BEST hygienist ever. She is super thorough, but gentle and always goes the extra mile with her patients.
Dr. Latham is fantastic, hands down. I'm one of those people with a pretty strong phobia of dentists but thanks to him I don't dread going to the dentist anymore.  He is super patient and kind. He will give you all the options available to you without hard selling you on the most expensive one. He pays close attention to how you are feeling/doing every step of the way. You are in the best hands with him.<//review>< Pics>

Great dentist, great staff, reasonable rates for cash customer with no insurance, has a yearly affordable membership for major work when needed to reduce costs, allowed to just see hygienist for a cleaning on 2nd 6 mos visit to save $, inviting environment, 5 min from home, easy parking in shopping center. Happy camper!<//review>

I'm very happy with this dental office. Everyone here is friendly and professional. The hygienists and dentist are thorough and make you feel comfortable as they work. They are honest and trustworthy, quite the contrast from a nearby dental office I tried previously that attempted to convince me I needed some costly treatment. The wait time is brief and scheduling is easy. I would HIGHLY RECOMMENDED this dental office!</Review>

<Review>I've been going to Latham Dental for nearly fifteen years.  There have never been any issues of any kind. His staff is always delightful and fun, yet highly professional, and he is so kind and caring, so thorough, yet not ever pushy. He is a "Let's watch and wait" type of dentist, rather than one who is looking to line his own pockets via unnecessary procedures.  Love this place!!</Review>< Pics>

<review>Latham Dental is by far the best dental office I’ve been to! From the moment you walk in, the front office staff greets you and makes you feel welcome. The receptionist, Samantha, is extremely helpful and goes above and beyond especially when answering insurance questions. In addition, Dr. Latham and Dental Hygienist, Ali, are amazing! They’re extremely thorough and make going to the dentist a pain free experience.</review>< rate>

I would like more attention to protection from Covid 19. There were 2 unmasked clients in the small waiting room. The hygienist was unmasked while she took me to the room and conversed with me, putting on her mask only when she began to work on me. In order to put credit card in device I had to come close to the unmasked receptionist . I have no complaint ,as usual , with the actual procedure.<//text>

Recently my 13 year old daughter needed to have a tooth pulled to allow the new tooth to come in. She gets anxious with any type of shot or bloodwork and Doctor Latham did a great job of talking her through the procedure, setting her mind at ease,  explains to her  what it would feel like and what to expect. My family has been going to Dr. Latham for several years and have found him and his staff go out of their way to provide excellent service.< /Text>

I always have a good experience at Dr. Latham's office.  His hygienists are top notch, very thorough yet gentle when they clean.  It is easy to get timely appointments, and if there is ever a problem with any of the dental work, they don't stop till everything is right.  Always fair and friendly!<//review>

Not all hot pots taste the same. They're different depending on which region of China they're from. Place is nice most especially at night, the ambience is perfect! I'm glad i tried this place out.< /review>< Pictures>

Simply wonderful Chinese food.
It Worth the price.
It is all you can eat...  But it is soup.
You choose beef or fish, pork and many other options.
Then you serve yourself begetables... Everything in a electric hot pot right on your table.
Yummy 😋🤤🤤😋< /review>< pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Blossom Season Hot pot is a great AYCE place. Their out door dining is very pretty looking with fairy lights and flowers and also safe. It isn't wrapped in plastic and has a lot of open air. Not at all like outdoor but indoor dining. They take your temperature before letting you in and you have to wear a mask when getting the sauces and AYCE vegetables and side dishes.</text>< Pics>

be careful with the spicy broth..
it is very spicy....& no replacement to broths you order w/o additional charge.  We had to remove some into other bowls and then have him added a our mushroom broth into it....it was a somewhat of a fix.< /text>

They don't have as many options as other places I've been, but what they have all goes very well together so I'd say its quality over quantity.</text>< name>

< Review>
A place that offering unlimited food and soda which has very good prices in my opinion. I am surprised for their hotpot because it can up or down to the broth, and we can get the food easily. About the food, I don't have any recommendations  because overall is good. Also, this place sometimes has people to sing on live which make the place more comfortable and fun too. I may come here more often because it is the place to get unlimited soda and food here.<//Review>

Clean and the vibe inside is good. The decorations for halloween look really nice. I love way the pot is set up. It's a square pot machine where you can raise the food out of the soup. Meat quality is good. The noodles were also good.<//Text>

This place is so cute!!!  AYCE hot pot.  They have soda and veggies/sides in the fridge for you to grab.  The sauces are also grab it yourself.  The only thing you order from the server is the meat.  Their presentation of the meat is awesome, and makes you feel like you're eating at a fancier place than an AYCE place.

Also, I love that there's a button to strain the hot pot!  That way, you don't have to go digging around for your items!< /text>

This place is horrible if you go here to eat with your kids. After I told them that my daughter is 12 years old. The guy went to front desk and after a while, three of them came to my table to ask to show my daughter’s ID, I asked them what ID I need show, they said ID to approve that my daughter is 12. I told them the kids here in US only have passport, no other ID except birth certificate which no one will bring it daily. Then they ask when is her last birth day , is it already pass 12? And they are keeping saying this is their policy that need ID to approve. The front desk lady even keep saying she already put her into computer to charge as adult, is that hard to change on her computer?  I feel so uncomfortable that everyone from other table looked at us, seems we are lying in front of my kid. I said fine to look all my photos to try to find something, luckly I found her passport. When I go to show them, they give me attitude saying They already change her to kid price, just stop showing them, and they protect busy not even apologize , keep saying they are doing their job to ask ID. Very bad experience, will never go there again. We never been asked ID for kid in any restaurants in US. They made us feel we are lying in front of kid!!!!<//Text>

They are very hospitable here . Gladly greeted me.  They have by one beer get 1 free. The veggies are in a refrigerator so you can get-up-and-get as much as you want. On another side of the restaurant they have French fries, wings, noodles , cucumber, rice , all the sauces you can get up and grab as much as you like. Try it... the spicy hot soup medium is really spicy. Ian and Carter were extremely hopeful.

<Text>love the soup base, and electronic pot which rised the food on.surface.  o you dont have to searching your items in hotpot.  meat dishes has a lot of room for improvement.  most of them fallen apart after cooked.  Veggie dish are stored in a glass cooler; however it caused huge traffic and inconvenient during peak hour.
soft drink also includes in the price, wish it can be serve at colder temp or with ice cube on the side.<//Text><user_name>Winston Chen<//user_name>< GmapID>

<rate>3< /rate><Text>The general concept is good (flower hot pot place... I guess??), but the execution was and is terrible. They've got the unique interior aspect down, but the safety and efficiency of customers kinda seemed to have gone out the window.

We came for dinner and it was pretty busy. We jotted our name down on their Yelp Wait list and waited about 20 minutes before a table opened up for us. We got the AYCE option and ordered their mushroom and mala soup. This is where everything just got tedious and annoying. Their side dishes (napa, fishballs, veggies, mushrooms, etc.) are piled into a tall industrial refrigerator where only one person (two if you squeeze) can stand by the door to get items. The top shelves are also very tall so if you're average to short, you'll have to tiptoe with possibility of tipping and spilling the top containers over. Then you also have to prop open the door with your hips because it doesn't have the option to hold itself open AND because each door only allows one person at a time, a line starts to form into really awkward areas of the restaurant where staff are carrying and rushing hot soup around (there was more than once where there were some major spillage the night we went because of this). It's dangerous and don't see how they don't care about the liability. LOL.

Then you have the snack and sauce bar, I don't know why it was designed and placed in an area where it was so narrow that no one can really walk pass from behind without bumping into the person trying to get sauce. You guys have so much room as a restaurant and ya just HAD to squeeze the sauce bar.

We ordered a few meats like lamb, beef and beef belly, but all of them were dry and chewy (like it had been badly frozen).

Overall, not my schtick. I was never a fan of ACYE, but the boyfriend wanted to so I obliged. This place is mostly for meat eaters in terms of getting the value out it. It was a waste of money for people like me who only ate their vegetables since they charge $27.00 per person for AYCE.</Text>< Pics>

Zanzibar is a chill above average (for price center) restaraunt. Decent selection if you are not concerned with your health and you eat meat. There is plenty of seating that can accommodate groups of 5 or more. It's an ideal location to host a lab lunch or host some visiting  academics.

The Zanzibar combo ( soup, sandwich and side )  is the most well rounded option. The staff here are the coolest in PC.<//text>

<Text>A really nice place to go that feels like it's off campus even though it is not. It's cozy, the menu is nice, and it's a bit removed from the bustle downstairs. Not the cheapest, but perhaps the best place to grab lunch on campus if you want to treat yourself a bit.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<Response>None</Response><Text>Food is always pretty good and the waits are usually pretty quick both to order and to receive food. It would be nice if there was a bit more normal table seating for larger groups though. The outside area is pretty nice, but can be high traffic depending on the students, also there aren't always umbrellas for shade.< /Text>< rate>

My friend recommended this place even it's a 45 minutes drive for her. It took me almost an hour to get there from another part of town and I have no regrets. Linda is such a warm and honest person, very sweet and welcoming. She recommended not to cut my daughter's hair and to wait, I truly appreciate her honest opinion and advise. She was very generous and sweet, a very pleasant person to deal with. Thank you, Linda!< /Text>

< review>
It was my first time to try dyeing my hair. I was thinking about the grey color but concerned about if it would harm my hair a lot. Cuz I heard that if I want that color, I need to bleach my hair before dyeing it, which might lead to damages to hair and scalp pain. One of my friends recommended me Sunny Day, which is a perfect and professional hair salon based on his experience. I made an appointment with hair stylist Young a day before. I was still worried about the bleaching process, but Young is super nice and thoughtful. She asked how do I feel, does my scalp hurt over the whole bleaching and dyeing. That made me feel much more comfortable. Though bleaching does hurt a little, the result is way better than what I thought!!! My hair was not damaged even a little bit of it!!! I highly recommend this hair salon and the hair stylist Young!(Tho I believe other hair stylists here would also be great!) You won't be despaired if you come here😄< /review>

I love Sunny Day People Hair Salon
Jake Neal! I go to Alisha for cut and reddish/auburn color and she does such a great job in making it look like my natural color. I always have a great experience there from the receptionist, to other staff through Alisha. Also, the fact you can book appointments through text message and they're open on Sundays for pretty much full business hours is a huge plus. Go here!<//text>

<Text>They charged an arm and a leg to color my wife's hair and only did the top. When she got home and pulled her hair up it was all untouched underneath.  For $270 I would expect the entire job to be done not half of the job for 2X the normal price, total rip off!!< /Text><Time>1591414837764</Time>< rate>

I would highly recommend this place for Japanese hair straightening! I've had my hair straightened here twice (once by Young and once by Julie) and both times they did an excellent job. Their prices are reasonable and the service is great, too!< /review>

First time trying out this salon and the first thing i really appreciated was the honesty from my hairstylist. I wanted to get golden highlights but I had 4 different colors in my hair which would not be possible to do over what I had so they suggested a second visit in order to get the exact look I wanted.</Text>

The hair colouring was good. Could have used more color on my hair but the result was good.

I had a good experience but my friend had a bad haircut experience here. He went for a faded cut and a part of his beard was gone. The lady who was cutting men’s hair refused to cut my friend’s hair. Idk why though.

I am not sure if I will go back here because I found other places that offer a better customer service at a better price range.<//text>

I highly recommend this place and Young to anyone that needs a new haircut or a new hair style. I really needed a good haircut and style after not going to any hair salon for a year, and I found this place through Google and Yelp, and I cannot be happier to find this place!

First, Young looked at my hair and recommended different types of styles that would fit me well, and helped me with the decision. She did a fantastic job! Following her suggestion and advice, I got the magic perm to straighten my frizzy hair and a beautiful cut in shoulder length! Three hours of styling did not feel like 3 hours and it was fun!

Again, highly recommend Young!</Text>

I did Japanese Hair Straightening, very expensive. Did the instructions of not washing hair for 3 days after the treatment. I only used organic shampoo and conditioner.Then after 20 days, my hair got curly on top. I think my money got wasted, I thought it's going to be worth it.<//text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Prior to Sunny Day Hair Salon, I always had my hair done somewhere else because I was comfortable there and didn't want to look for a new stylist. However, after my family members received a series of great hair cuts from Sunny Day, I figured I should just try it out.

Julie is amazing. Now I'm really particular about the different styles I want. Once I find a picture I like, I'm dead set on it and only want it done that way. However, Julie is really great at giving advice and knows what looks good on different face shapes. So, she'll give you her thoughts and advice but if you really want it done your way, she'll do it for you.

I recently got highlights and showed her a picture of how I wanted it. I was pretty resistant towards her recommendations so she gave me what was in the picture. It didn't really turn out how I wanted, so I went back and she fixed it for me perfectly. She explained that the reason why I couldn't get the effect of the highlights I wanted in the pictures was because it was too light and not natural for my hair. So in the end, the advice she gave me for my first appointment was to prevent something like this from happening.

She's someone that you can trust and knows what she's talking about, so I highly recommend her and the rest of the ladies at Sunny Day!</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<text>Each stylist has their own style which is really cool... every time I come in I get a different stylist who I always let them freestyle my hair cause I trust them with it. My particular hair is straight, thick, Asian, male, so your mileage may vary. No matter what random cut they give me, it always comes out looking good<//text>< username>

<Review>5 stars for excellent service and excellent staff! I came in for a last min hair straightening treatment an hour before closing and my hairstylist Young still took me in. She was so friendly and kind! The process took past closing time and the entire staff stayed behind to take care of my hair without rushing the process. I've had a nightmare hair straightening experience from a different hair salon where they damaged my hair to the point it caused breakage. But here Young and Julie took care to make sure my hair would stay healthy with an additional Hair Botox treatment which is magic by the way. It's an additional cost but worth it to keep your hair healthy, shiny, and fuss free straight. It's definitely worth the price tag to wake up everyday and not have to spend more than five minutes on my hair.
Overall the staff was incredibly friendly and I can vouch for Young and Julie's talent and passion. They want to make you feel beautiful and I left feeling just that way. It was a great experience and I will definitely be back!< /Review>< Pictures>

I've been coming here for a few months and I love it. Julie is really great. She knows the newest styles and would recommend what would go great with your face. She will straight up warn you that it won't look great. She is basically a mom with hairstyling skills.< /Text>

<Text>I highly recommend Sunny Day People Hair Salon.
Julie has been cutting my hair for years and she does an excellent job every time.
Julie is professional, and also friendly, but most of all she listens to what her client wants.
She spends a great deal of time on hair and I never leave the chair until she and I feel everything is complete.
There are 3 other stylists and they all are talented and genuinely care about offering great services.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Been going to Sunny Day salon for over a year and the service is great! I come here almost every month to get a haircut from Kathy. She is very friendly and great at what she does. She also makes great style suggestions for her customers. I always leave the salon satisfied with my hair. A lot of my friends also come to this salon and they are satisfied with their service.
Most definitely recommend this salon!< /Text>

The first haircut was great, the second was awful, and the third time I left after having to wait for 20 minutes past my appointment time without any offer of assistance. The haircuts may be good from some stylists but the customer service is horrible unless you know the owners personally. I would recommend going to a different salon where you and your time is valued.< /Review>< pics>

<text>The staff were nice, but I was not happy with my haircut. It looked nothing like the magazine page that I gave the stylist to use as a reference. When I requested my stylist to cut more of my hair to match the photo, she refused to, saying short hair would not look stylish. I am guessing she was more conservative and didn’t approve of girls having short hair, but the magazine I was using was from their salon, and had a bunch of women featured in it with cute short hair styles!

When I walked over to check out my sister’s haircut, we both chuckled because even though we gave our stylists different reference images, our hairstyles just looked like “mushroom heads” (that’s what people literally say in Cantonese to refer to a medium length bob).

In conclusion, if you want a place that will do a standard haircut, go here. However, if you want a more personalized haircut, go somewhere else.<//text><Time>1534293824286<//Time><Response>None< /Response><pictures>None< /pictures><Rate>2</Rate><gmapID>0x80dbff96a39b07ff:0xadb66ab6fe4a23ee< /gmapID>< user_name>

< review>
Got hair straightening done in April and it only lasted 2 months. Not worth the very high price I paid. Young was the one who did my hair but Julie kept making her assist other customers while I waited longer than I had to that day. Julie was the one who did the flat iron part of the process and was not meticulous about it.  That is probably why it didn't last very long. Waste of my money and time.<//review>

<Text>Here’s the best hair salon in San Diego! The place is very approachable and nice. Especially, Katie is the best. She kindly recommends good hair care products, and teaches me about the hair styling tips.< /Text>< Rate>

<review>I have been coming to Sunny Day Salon for  last 10 years.
What I like this salon is that they have a wonderful facial estethian, hair color specialist with first class coloring product and the best manicure/pedicure specialist.
I like the fact that I can have three excellent services at once in the same place. One seamless service. What a good business model.
Excellent service !!! I have been happy for last ten years!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Found this place on maps. Had great reviews on Google and Yelp so I decided to check it out yesterday and I have to say that I do not regret my decision. Katie was my hair stylist. I told her that I wanted a cut to get rid of my split ends, that framed my face, and thinned out my hair and she did a fantastic job. I would definitely return for another haircut in the future​!<//Text>

I had a really great experience here with a digital perm. I just came knowing that I wanted that "natural and wavy" look but didn't know what kind of perm would work with my hair. Luckily, I didn't have to know! They knew the perm that would work well for me and would give me the desired look, and it turned out amazing! It'd better than I could have hoped for!</review>

I'm embarrassed to admit that my hair is as stubborn as its human. Because of that, Julie and her assistant spent nearly an hour on me, patiently, from hair wash to styling with a smile on their faces the whole time. More importantly, Julie first asked me what I was looking for and then constantly checked with me to make sure that I was comfortable with the length and what not. Clean salon and professional hair stylist. Definitely a great find in San Diego area.</Text>< Pics>

This review is looong overdue, but I had a great experience getting my hair treated, cut, permed, and styled by the wonderful Katie! She was so friendly and patient throughout the process and I am so pleased with the results. It's been almost two months since I got my digital perm and treatment, and my hair still looks great. Looking forward to going back for more treatment and cuts in the future!</Review>

<text>I saw a hairstyle that I really liked but didn't know how to explain it to the stylist. So I took a screenshot of the hairstyle that I wanted and showed it to Katie at Sunny Day. Not only did she cut it exactly like the picture but she did so by taking my face and head shape into consideration. Katie was very professional, courteous, and efficient. I recommend Sunny day and Katie 100%.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I have been coming here for a couple years now. Julie, the owner of Sunny Day Hair Salon never seems to dissapoint me. They have great services here, all friendly and well mannered. Starting from face products, to varieties of hair colors, and even pedicure. This place has always been the place to come to when I need a new hairstyle and a place where I can look amazing! I really love this place!!!!< /review>

<user_name>Eh K< /user_name><Response>None< /Response><Review>This is a way overdue posting.  After coming here for the second time I had to post something.  Young stylist has saved my hair!!! My daughter and I were visiting San Diego in April during spring break and wanted to get our hair done.  I was little hesitant due to an experience in Bay Area but my daughter persisted... and it turned out to be a true blessing !!To make long story short, a stylist in the Bay Area burned my entire hair (to the root) and since then I have been cutting little by little to recover.  Hence I was very hesitant to goto any salon for month!  But my hair was way pass due for care and my daughter wanted to get her hair done so I took a chance with Sunny Salon.  To my amazement Young gave my hair the look I have been dying for.  I had the hair treatment with Asian straight perm.  It came out so well that I refuse to go to any local salon.  This is my second time here and I plan to come back.  I highly recommend anyone to test her out.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< GmapID>

First of all she is so careful to her customers. As far as i remember, i could not give much requests cuz they also another customers behind me. But she was not. She listened to carefully whatever i requested. Second she is really skillful. I dont know much about styling so i need communicate a lot whenever i go to hair salon. But she gave feedback in detail and gave me wonderful service. I seriously recommend this person. YOU should go meet her if u  care abour ur hair<//Text>< Pictures>

I have been looking for a good hair salon eversince i moved to san diego 6 years ago. After 3 years of search i found this hair salon. I've been coming here for almost three years now and have gotten personally befriended with the hairstylist named Katie. She's always been wonderful and very nice everytime I go. There hasn't been a single time when I wasn't satisfied. Katie has been always very thorough with hairstyle advises. I strongly strongly recommend this place!! Check this place next time you to do your hair!!</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Katie's hair is very nice and nice. As I was a side job, I couldn't decide how to cut my hair every time, but it was good to tell me in advance that some cuts would be fine and easy to manage later. Thank you for letting me know how to clean or dry my hair after shampooing.

케이티선생님께서 머리 해주셨는데 너무 친절하시고 잘 해주시네요. 제가 옆머리가 드는직모여서 항상 머리 자를때마다 어떻게자를지 결정을 잘 못했는데 어떤커트가 괜찮고 추후 관리도 편할거라고 미리 말씀해주셔서 좋았습니다. 샴푸 후 머리손질이나 드라이 하는법도 알려주셔서 감사했구요~ 다음에도 또 방문할거같습니다.<//Review>< Rate>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It will cut as you wish and will advise you not to be too extreme. It's also priced at $ 30, so I didn't feel the need to try anything else.

<text>(Translated by Google) Find Katie on Sunny Day. Many hair designers say that my hair is a bit tricky, but this is the only person in San Diego who cares for my hair.
I'm not going to brush it.

써니데이에서 케이티를 찾으세요. 많은 헤어디자이너들이 제 헤어를 많이 까다롭다고 해요 그치만 이분은 샌디에고주에서 유일하게 가장 제 머리를 잘 다루시네요.
솔까말 여기말고는 안가요.< /text>< Pictures>

This place is the one I like best. I go to a lot of restaurants but to this restaurant I  constantly return again and again. The crew is very amicable and the cooking they offer is so tasty. I never decline to have a decent dinner here. Highly recommended.<//review>

First time ever visiting this spot and I was pleasantly surprised. Their food is actually pretty good. I didn't dine in, but the place looks like it's always buzzing with people so I assume it must be far more popular than I thought. I got the nachos, my kids had some rice and beans. This places packs a good rice and bean, not bland like others I've been too and the nachos were packed. Definitely will be stopping by again to try the other items on The I menu.</Text>

I remember when this place was Chano's back in the day. The food was very good. We're from Covina and stopped to see if food was good. Met people from El Monte that came in for the same reason. They loved their food too. Great job! Very nice staff.</Text>

<text>First and foremost reading negative comments is not a good thing. All these comments are prior to me taking over. I can assure you since I have been in charge there have been changes for the better. The food especially is much improved. I am constantly working on making Chano's a better place for you to enjoy. Realistically nothing can ever be approved by 100% of the public but I work hard to come close to it. I have a motto, "I am better then Burger King" meaning I will make anything anyway you want. So please stop by and give Chano's a try again. Thank you< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< rating>

< Review>
The only reason I gave it one star was because, without a single start it won't be posted . All I wanted was a carnitas burrito the meat tasted old it had more rice than anything else, well except for the tortilla. Extremely disappointing , maybe they had an off day , but when the salsa was bland. It's hard to think anyone would like the food here<//Review>

There were two cooks and a cashier on Tuesday 07/10/18 at 7:30 pm.  One of the cooks was on a break and the cashier was taking money an then touching the food without washing his hands or wearing gloves.   That was my first and last time there.  I asked for money back and left.< /Text>

There are two things you should order here. One is the breakfast burrito. It runs you about $5. It has eggs, cheese, pico de gallo, beans, and your choice of chorizo, bacon, or veggies. Personally I order it without the beans, which can sometimes be a bit overbearing. The burrito comes with chips and salsa.

The second thing you should order are the carne asada nachos which run you about $7. These are the freshest, best tasting nachos you will ever have. Just the right amount of chips, meat, cheese, some mystery sauce, guacamole, and sour cream. They aren't your typical nachos flooded with nacho cheese, they use fresh ingredients, which give a different look and flavor to the nachos.<//review>

<review>I promised I'd give a 5-star rating when I found one equivalent to my favorite in Japan. This place is it! Been there twice now, both times were great  massages. I'd suggest getting the hardest pressure you can tolerate - it helps blood circulation, which promotes healing. I highly recommend this place!<//review>< name>

My wife and I had our first Thai massage at the Bangkok Day Spa. We had a couples massage and thoroughly enjoyed it. They were very communicative and always checking in on the pressure. They were very good and you can’t beat the price. Highly recommend!</text>

It’s hard to find a good massage, it’s kind of a shot in the dark when you go someplace new, but Bangkok Day Spa did not disappoint. Staff was friendly and my masseuse was a veteran. She (Lily) adjusted and applied the right amount of pressure throughout the massage and I left feeling very refreshed. Would go back!< /Text>

<text>Definitely AUTHENTIC Thai Massage. They offer a range of services such as specialty and combination massages, aromatherapy, body scrubs, etc... The people there are very warm, professional, and very helpful with my questions. When I got my massage, I requested for medium (since the scale was for soft, medium, or hard). Let me just say, the experience was perfect! Versus the typical Asian massages that I've gotten throughout the years, the massage I got here was just what I wanted! I actually dozed off at some point out of total relaxation, and fell dead on my bed as soon as I got home. Lol. Definitely will come back to try on their other services :)<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

And also prefect price with a good massage. Hard to find at first because it was on the second floor and on the side of G st. But address is 4th avenue. So a little bit lost at first.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>I am new to San Diego and after all the moving my back has been killing me!!! So I started calling around trying to get an opening and finally stumbled upon Bangkok Day Spa. I couldn't have been more happy with the environment, the massage and the price. I told the lady what was going on and the issues I was having, and told her to do what she needed, so she did a Thai and Swedish combo and I feel like a million bucks!!! I will definitely be back and highly recommend this establishment<//review>< name>

<text>I went to take advantage of Groupon’s discounted rate the other day. However, on my appointment, I discovered that this was not your typical traditional Thai Massage rather deep tissue or Swedish massage. The masseuse just massaged my back, neck, and head—spending much time on my scalp. I was immensely disappointed with the service and the experience.< /text>< Pictures>

The masseuse I got this time was amazing. I told her about my problem area and she really knows her nerve and muscle anatomy. She really focused.<//Review>

< Review>
I have been here for a massage twice so far, and there were several inconsistencies both times.

As soon as I arrived for my initial appointment, the lady at the front desk took me directly to the room to get undressed. There was no introduction, no paperwork, and she did not even ask me about any specific problem areas. At one point, she started using hot stone which helped to mitigate my sore muscles. I felt that she didn't really incorporate many Thai techniques; it felt much more like a Swedish massage. She did stretch me for about a minute towards the end and gently pounded on my back with her fists for 10 seconds; other than that, it wasn't much of a Thai massage. She also ended the session 10 minutes early.

For my returning visit, I had a different massage therapist named Jiji who did a fantastic job. My visit with her was definitely 5 Stars. She inquired about any problem areas and made sure to focus on those areas. She incorporated many Thai massage techniques, and she spent a reasonable amount of time stretching me out in several places. Unfortunately, she didn't use hot stone or tiger balm like the previous massage therapist, but her technique was so good that I didn't really mind. She also went the full 60 minutes. Jiji was very sweet and asked me if I was ok every single time she heard a crack, which happened several times during the massage, and boy did it feel good. My only complaints would be that the room was cold and Jiji stepped out a few times to grab hot towels- those should be accessible in every room.

Great deal with the yelp check in too. I'll be back to get another massage with Jiji.</Review>

Samantha Gillespie is very informative, cordial, professional and on top of things. She is thorough, precise, and attentive to detail. I greatly appreciated that and especially Samantha’s timeliness in getting back to me and getting multiple tasks accomplished quickly. I was a Regional Sales Manager for a Fortune 500 company for 20 years and I would have hired Samantha in a minute! She is great at what she does. Great Job Samantha and keep up the nice work. Thanks again for being so pleasant to work with. SureCo has a keeper in you.</Text>

I worked with Kevin Parson who set me up for the best dollar-for-dollar coverage for myself and my family. I chose the PPO coverage. Kevin took the time to coherently explain my options. He understands the product and is not just reading a script.
It was so good I had my sister sign up with Kevin and now she is saving thousands of dollars and has better coverage than before.
Kevin Parson is a true professional. I highly recommend calling him if you want better Healthcare for less than you pay now!<//review>

<time>1621433168466<//time><Text>I just received notification that my credit was hit with an unpaid medical bill because SureCo didn't pay the $86 bill.  We have discussed this issue with our rep and member services several times.   Everyone told us when we discussed it that an office visit would be paid, however, it didn't get paid.  Now this scam of a health insurance company has damaged my credit which I am in the middle of several business transactions that will be impacted. The lack of follow through and attention to detail is poor.  The damage this has done to me is unknown. I will advise anyone that the system doesn't work for wellness and routine like it was sold, maybe catastrophic works but I would not trust it. This is the second member sharing group we've been burned by.  Now I have more than just my family impacted, my employees families could be impacted because SureCo didn't pay a routine bill.  Unacceptable and has brought no value to me and my family.</Text>< user_name>

< Review>
Laura Clement has been very professional and has not missed a beat with prompt responses and doing what she says she will do.  She has been a pleasure to work with while establishing our insurance, and I look forward to our continued relationship by having a contact person I can easily reach should I have questions.< /Review>

<Review>I worked with Laura Clement and was totally pleased with my experience.  Not only did I end up with an affordable health care plan for my family,  but most importantly for me, I felt I understood the product I was purchasing.  Laura listened to my situation, answered questions thoroughly and helped me to feel confident in future interactions with her and the product.</Review><username>Suzanne Wilkins< /username></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Tim Roman was extremely helpful and knowledgeable when we signed up with UHSM earlier this year. We had contemplated switching from "traditional" insurance to a Medi-share plan for a couple of years. Tim was able to promptly answer all of our questions and alleviate our concerns. Shortly after we made the switch, Tim followed up with us to see if we needed any help. Then recently my husband had to have unexpected surgery and Tim was a huge blessing to us. He seemed to personally care about our situation and helped us navigate the process. He also told us he would be praying for a successful surgery which gave us a lot of peace during this stressful time. We have been very impressed with Tim's knowledge, professionalism, promptness in his replies, patience and compassionate attitude.< /Review>< name>

I worked with Richard Kuo over the phone to set up my health insurance coverage. He was polite and sounded energized over the phone. Working with him was easy, and he walked me through the entire application process in a way that made it easy to understand. He highlighted coverage areas and explained how they would specifically benefit me and my insurance needs based on the information I provided to him. The plan he selected to talk about was exactly the type of coverage I was looking for and was within my budget. All of my questions were answered well and in a way that made it easy to understand, highlighting examples of how different components of the coverage worked. If you are a Christian looking for health coverage that is affordable, I recommend giving SureCo Healthcare + Technology a call, and working with Richard Kuo if you can.</text>

I immediately connected with my broker Danielle, she answered every question I asked. Danielle also listened to all my concerns and found coverage that fit my needs and budget. Danielle made me feel like family and my needs mattered.

Richard was able to help us find an affordable health care plan that was right for us. He was very polite and didn't pressure us into anything more than what we needed.  This will save us money over our previous health insurance plan. They have good values and beliefs. We need that in today's world.<//text>

I have been working with Lesley Bazant and now Micheal Martinez for quite some time and they are wonderful! Very personable, easy to talk to, they fully explain everything so you're not surprised once you sign up. I have recommended them to a few people because, even if you don't wind up signing with what they find for you, you know that they tried their best to help you find the best deal! They always work with me and are always honest about my options and help me find the most affordable options.<//Review>

and took a lot of her time making sure the application process was done correctly. Ms. Parkers Kindness went a very long way today.
We highly recommend Jolene Parker if you are in need of Insurance Coverage.<//Review>< pics>

I am very impressed with the service Tim Roman has provided me.  I was laid off my job on 3/31/20 due to the COVID-19 crisis. Since I couldn't afford the exorbitant  COBRA health benefits offered by my employer, I checked on line for Covered CA information and located Tim. He was personable and provided  credible, accurate and timely information so that I could get low cost health insurance that same day. He is very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions.  He  also provided information so that I could secure dental and eye care insurance as well.  The invaluable services he has provided helped relieve my fears of being uninsured as I continue my efforts in trying to secure employment during this difficult time.  He has been the bright spot during these unprecedented times.<//text>

< Review>
I 'm 62, and  I was shopping for health insurance after separation from my job. I'm thankful that I came across SureCo just by chance and the person I talked was Jeff Gracia. He explained various options over the phone and emailed me various health care options via email.  He let me sink in everything at my own pace.  When you are shopping for health insurance you will come across various people who will pressure you in buying their product. It was quite different from SureCo and Jeff Gracia. I had to go back to SureCo and Jeff Gracia because I felt they were most knowledgable most sincere in their effort to help me than anybody else during my health insurance buying process. I want to Thank Jeff first, and would recommend anybody who is looking for health insurance to talk to Jeff at SureCo.</Review>

A family crisis required me to move immediately out of state to be closer to my daughter and her family. I needed health insurance fast. Tim Roman found a share plan that fit perfectly for my budget, family and needs. His care, patience and competence were a welcome relief to a difficult life event where I did not have the bandwidth to deal with one more thing! He helped navigate an overwhelming situation in the world of health care to find a product that works for us. I highly recommend TIM ROMAN.< /text>

Going from group health insurance for 33 years to now figuring out what’s best for both me and my husband is hard but Steven made it easy. So thankful our paths crossed!< /review>

Look out Flo, Jeff Garcia is my Insurance Super Hero!
This gentleman’s ability to take the seemingly age old problem of health insurance coverage and make options accessible as well as easily understood is incredibly appreciated...</Review>

<text>There are several things I like about SureCo.  The first thing is my insurance guy Tim Roman - what a kind and patient man.  He understood my frustration in getting insurance since I had always had it through my jobs, I never had to get it on my own - he walked me through it step by step.  No pressure and I like the fact that he checks on me to see if this level of insurance is still working for me.  The second thing I like is I don't have a copay for my prescriptions and I take a lot so anywhere I can save is a bonus.  I have even had some surgery and my insurance covered all of it except for a few hundred - it wasn't even that good with my work insurance.  I am super pleased all the way around -- thanks Tim for being my guy through all of this!!</text>< Pics>

Please take my advice,  do not sign up for UHSM health sharing through SureCo.  The model seems nice, and they model it after traditional insurance, although they do make you understand it is not insurance.  I was a member for 9 months.  The cost is not cheap.  They would not cover my shingles shot, nor would they allow me to apply the cost to my "member share".  Additionally, they say they cover the cost of wellness visits, mammograms, etc.  However, they would not pay the Radiologist's bill on my mammogram read, even though the facility I went to was in-network.  This is called balance billing.  It is not legal in my state, but of course UHSM is not subject to any regulations.  Additionally, they would not even allow me to apply my out-of-pocket costs for the Radiology read to my "member share".  Finally, since January of 2020, the UHSM member portal has not been functional, so you can't even look up your Explanation of Benefits online.  You have to wait for them to mail it to you, which they delay for as long as possible so that you do not know that they are not going to pay for a covered service in full.< /Text>

For anyone that has been looking for more affordable medical insurance. At 60yrs.old I had to start buying private health insurance. Anyone that has knows how unbelievably expensive it is. For 2yrs. I have been checking into all my options.  I decided to try UHSM  ministry. They offered somethings the other sharing programs did not.Today I had to use Telemedicine and within 20 minutes I was speaking to a Dr. and he called in a prescription. I was immediately contacted by a case manger. It went so smooth with no problem. All covered under my policy. I am paying half the monthly premium that I was. Sign up was very easy all over the phone.  This is who I signed up with Micheal Martinez at Sure co healthcare. He was very patient and explained everything to me and walked me through the application process over the phone. He got  in contact with me to make sure things are good with me after I was signed up. This has been my  experience with  UHSM and I am very satisfied.< /Review>

I’m so appreciative of the time and explanation that Jaemes B spent with my husband and I. He was thorough and answered our many questions. He kept us informed and returned our phone calls when he said he would. I will gladly recommended Jaemes  with SURECo to others that are looking for a sharing plan to meet their medical needs.

Bryan Black was awesome. I recently lost my job and need to find affordable health insurance. Bryan was very patient and kind during this process. He helped me find affordable health and dental insurance. I am grateful for his help.</Review>

I can’t say so much good of this company when they sale you a health insurance and they trick you on adding a another incident insurance on top of the other one my mistake was that I never reviewed my contract when I sin my paper work ..... this happened December 2016 is 2019 is been 2 years gearing charged $43 every month with not founding out just found out this month and that was only cause my husband got a overdraft on his account . I try fixing it and speaking with the person that had originally sold me the insurance but my luck hey did not work her any more ... thanks MARK GREEN 🖕🏻great job .
Is sad that just to make more sales there willing to trick people this way . Now I have to some how pay my husband $1,036. Dollars little by little trust me I know that I might not get my money back but . I will leave make sure everyone that watches this review hope that they see how dirty and scan-less they are .<//Review>

<Text>Cool little shack on the side of the road and there’s a tree right next to you.  They fortified the walls outside the patio area... probably because it’s on the side of a steep mountain and they don’t want people falling to their deaths.   So not much to look at but still a pretty cool place for a quick bite to eat.  The coffee is unique and the French toast is heavenly.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Fair prices and the food is good.  Biscuits and Gravy for breakfast is very good.  Also, we like all of their sandwiches for lunch.  There is a couple that runs this place and he is the waiter and she is the cook.  They are both very nice and they are really nice to kids!</Text>

Service was a little slow but definitely worth the wait. Compliments to the chef!! Yum! I will be returning on my next trip to tahoe.< /Review></record>

Fantastic place to stop for breakfast or lunch after filling up the car. I had the waffle breakfast and it was prepared very well. The over medium egg was perfectly cooked which is something that rarely happens in my experience. The bacon was lean and crisp and the waffle was one of the best I've ever had. It looked perfect with a crunchy golden brown outside and hot fluffy inside. It also tasted good enough that it was the first time I've eaten a plain waffle without wanting to add butter or syrup.</review>

<Text>4th of July we stopped to order food to go. While waiting for our food, we went in line for the restroom. After our food was ready, the owner started, pushing us out and saying "to many people you have to go out, you can't use the restroom". While all this was going on, customers where in the restaurant.  Three people sitting at a table being served and a Family of 8 outside in the patio. He rushed us from the time we walked in to order, he wasn't friendly at all. As I was standing in line I thought, "WOW he's Blessed with a restaurant off of Kyburz, going toward Tahoe", I never give a review. However 9 days later and it still bothers me how he was trying to push me and my Son out the side door, because he had locked the front door. I will never stop here again. I sure hope the owner reads this.'</Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>This place is terrible. The guy crushed my foot with his foot. The breakfast said it comes with country potatoes, but he never gave us any. He then charged us an 18% service charge without mentioning it. Never coming back. Place was profoundly disappointing.

<rating>5< /rating><text>Local. We have been coming here for years. Very nice couple runs the place who work very hard. Cook is great. The only downfall is the people wanting to use the bathroom. This restaurant, like all of us who live here in the mountains, are on a septic system, folks! Septics need to be drained and that costs $$$$$. Don’t post negative reviews because you don’t take precautions such as going where there is a pubic toilet or bringing a potty bag that you can buy on Amazon. And don’t go in front of our cabins!< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Good breakfast!  Only annoying thing was the people who poured in trying to just use the bathroom.  This is a small cafe on the road to Tahoe, has signs clearly posted restrooms for customers. Like those of us who live up here they are on a septic system.  It cannot support massive numbers of people who forgot to pee before leaving Pollock Pines.  The poor owner had to finally lock the door. People were irate at having to buy food too use the restroom.  Every place between Pollock Pines and Tahoe has to charge to use the BR!  It's not a RIGHT to go in and use a private businesses BR. The food is ample, fresh and good.</review>< GmapID>

<text>We enjoy meeting for breakfast at the Silver Fork Cafe on local rock climbing trips.  The food is good and there are plenty of options.  The owner is a tad grouchy as there is always one person bringing in their own drink.  Nevertheless, we appreciate his home grown business and want to support him.  It's always a good way to start a day of rock climbing, with a good breakfast and conversation among friends.  We will visit this restaurant every time we are in the area.< /text>< pictures>

<text>Clean place, simple menu. I guess it's reasonably priced but burgers and sandwiches don't come with fries or sides so it ended up being a little spendy.

The minute we stepped into the place, a man came over without serving or asking us what we'd like to order, instead, he just said "the restroom is not available for use". We felt so strange and tried to explain to him we just wanted to order some food instead of taking the restroom, the man kept saying no restroom out loud, there were a few other customers sitting in the place with a shocking face, the man is crazy! Don't come to this place unless you want to try this type of service!< /text>

Solid place to stop on a drive. Reasonable prices and cheesy omelettes. My companion said the hash browns were excellent. Attentive yet quirky owner/manager adds to the charm of this spot.< /review>

Grumpy owner, small portions with a BIG price!

I didn't order a drink so he charged additional 15%

Even has a hand written note on cash register stating "Some Customers 15% Service Charge"

Keep on driving, Don't Stop Here!<//Review>

<Review>I was in the area with my girl visiting her mother, and we wanted something to eat on the way back.  I ordered us two philly cheese steaks and lemonades.  He comes back with our order.  All the sandwhiches had on them was a tough and chewy thin piece of sirloin with lettuce tomatoe.  I asked for cheese. Instead of giving it to me he said that the philly doesnt have cheese on it. ...what? It was weird but i wanted to be cool in front of my girl.  I ask for the check. This guy not only got our order wrong but he charged me for 2 rib eye sandwhiches! The bill was 30 bucks! And when I brought it up he said ok ill charge you one philly cheese steak and one rib eye.  I was so angry I just paid it and left. HORRIBLE service.  I will not only never go back but Im going to warn everybody.  The guy straight up scammed me.< /Review>< pictures>

Just a note: this place is open only for breakfast and lunch. Saw it on the way up and stopped on our way home, but it was just after 3, so no luck. L Closes at 3. Hopefully next time.<//text>

(Translated by Google) It is delicious, but the boss is older, '' I can appeal to young people !! ''

맛은 있으나 사장님 께서 연로하신 게'' 젊은 사람들한테는 어필할수 있을런지!!""< /Text>

Aaron has excellent customer service everytime I go in to order my daily coffee. He knows exactly what I'm going to order and smiles if I ask for something to be customized. He is hasty and quick when working so that is very important to me as I'm always busy. I look forward to being serviced by Aaron!<//review>

Went to this Starbucks on 7/25 around 9am. The white chubby lady refuse to complete my order because it was for postmates. They said only corporate Starbucks can take postmates orders. I asked why they had sent me there if that was the case, and she said because "Postmates is stupid".  I then get a notification from postmates saying that "merchant cancelled the order because they were to busy to complete the order." SMH< /text>

I brought my nephew in from out of town to check out a Frys. All I found was a shell of its former glory. Though there is some really nice under the sea decorations and fish tanks around the inside of the building. I'm not sure if the building was a different store before. They have very few good electronic items but the rest just looks like third party or swap meet type items. wondering if they rent out shelf space now?< /Text>

<text>I'm afraid the covid-19 pandemic is the death knell for Fry's Electronics. Went to the store in August and found nothing but cleared shelves. Even the warehouse side of the store seemed empty. Did not have a single electronic item that I wanted, and the employees all seemed apathetic and unconcerned. One guy at one register, even though there was eight people in line. Took a half hour to check out. I hope I'm wrong, but I honestly think Fry's Electronics is checking out.< /text>< time>

But when I popped in the day after Christmas to get a keyboard adaptor, the normally bustling store was deserted. It was eerie. But they had the same huge collection of everything electronic at great prices. .<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Sadly as of Feb 24 2021, the Fry's electronic store has closed permanently.  Both of the store locations in Arizona and the rest of the US has permanently closed.  Even the online ecommerce has shuttered down. Frys was one of the last remaining big chain electronic stores where you can get everything you need to build a computer, or any electronic parts, etc. Now its just Best Buy and Amazon.  Arizona needs at least another choice.  Where is Microcenter when we need one? Microcenter should open at least one store here in Phoenix.</text>

<text>Talk about empty. What they have looks like a swap meet inside. Needed 4 of 1 kind of item. Had to get 4 different items and modify them for project. Good place to go if you need gloves masks or gallons of hand sanitizer. No one is there so it is a safe place to shop if you don't need to buy anything.</text>< Pictures>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Rating>3<//Rating><review>Man....such a legendary store but...

It's just so sad right now.

Big aquariums, huge statues even bigger parking lot.... But no people?

No inventory?

No employees?

Fry's will always be my favorite electronics store.

However the pandemic hit fry's HARD, I can't believe I am about to say this but right now I would rather go to best buy....

Hopefully fry's will be back to normal after the pandemic.

Pros:

Big store
Nice decor
Big parking lot

Cons:
No inventory
No employees
No people
No noticeable sales

Why go to this fry's when you can just go to best buy and get a better deal and price?

Will alter review after pandemic.< /review>< gmap_id>

Having isles that are very thin on stock or completely empty isn't a great shopping experience. Such a giant space makes it feel like a ghost town when there are few customers and fewer employees. The merchandise checker wasn't even there at the exit.< /text>< Name>

Fry's electronics used to be a great store to find all kinds of goodies. this place is pretty much been stripped bear and doesn't have much to sell. The other day I was in there and quite frankly there was one or two people behind the counter and the rest of the store was devoid of any employees who could help answer questions. Really too bad it used to be a great store.</review>

Awesome and beautiful store. Really sad to see it so empty. So much better than shopping online in so many ways. It is actually inspirational to browse all the products that you otherwise never even think to seek online.< /text>

<review>Empty.  Like a ghost town.
No employee greeted or said a word.
The ground nearly caved in walking on it.  My fiance and I tripped over it and we are not clumsy types.

This place sure has gone down hill.  And to imagine this review was 5 stars 2 years ago.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Atlantis! I would personally go here to spend my time at the many aquariums they have throughout the store. The detail that these individuals put into their store themes deserves all of the credit! I only wish they would wear togas! Did I mention the fountain? Beautiful!

The atmosphere can not be beat. Fry’s has something for the whole family. The workers are polite. There are infomercial finds, lighting displays (literal electricity), games, make your own, and so much more.

The only negative experience I have had out of the hour long visits was at the restaurant inside. The worker didn’t want to help me, so I decided to spend my money elsewhere.

Check out this beauty... and be sure to look up at the light fixtures!</Text>

<text>Normally, I love this place. But due to COVID, the shelves were empty, if not entirely removed from the floor. When I asked one the employees if they would be going out of business he said "Probably". If they survive the pandemic and return to what they used to be, I'll highly recommend this establishment. There are always better stocked than most Best Buys. As well as offering a far wider selection of electronics and related items in general. Not to mention, a staff that actually knows what they're talking about in their respective areas. I hope Fry's survives.<//text>< pics>

Courteous staff when you can find them. Startling lack of inventory only enhances my nagging concern that Fry's will go out of business. Are they janky? Yes, but Fry's is my happy place. No other brick and mortar carries the kind of stuff they do, and Fry's' low prices are legit. I have a lot of business to conduct with Fry's, and I hope you'll support them too.< /Review>

Went with two asus routers AC Raptor ac 5300/ Asus ac68u and Motorola modem under my extended warranty  on 12/7 to San Marcos Fry’s after ASUS wanted me to send them the products. I went to where I purchased all my electronics with the extended warranty. Like everyone says it was a great store in the past but when you have two un professional employees such as Andrea Williams and Tom Gamboa at this location things need to be shared  for others to know.  No follow up as stated within 48 hrs. I walked in and the store is a ghost town. The two employees have zero customer service skills.  I have also Facebook messaged the Corp office for a call back. I highly recommend no one to wasting your Precious time at this location or Fry’s electronics in general. No one is there to assist you but  seating in the back office collecting a pay check- Tom Gamboa. No one in the service area= Deadsville.

Hope this helps< /Text>

<Date>1543617721501<//Date><rating>3</rating><Text>The store is very nice, lots of neat and useful low priced items. No help staff at the front door today, which is not a big deal except I hurt my foot and it pains me to walk and was looking forward to using a electric cart to go around the very large store. I could understand having only one or two available however this Fry's does not have any available. I think they ought to invest in one at least to say it is in use.
My experience itself was good. I found cool item I was not there for and really like it.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>Amazing store! In Austin, Texas, same store has a grand piano inside and outside. This store has humungous fish tanks everywhere. They contain tropical fish such as Dory. This place worth visiting. As for the store shelves, they are full of unique stuff, which is typical for any Fry’s store.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrXJNPebiwE-ZL0rN1ZcRHY6OA6OAYKp2EOPvt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-As55IvihIUnl-yGdRUanzjpRI9QTlGDjHJxi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1sr20rzON14cszHnpyjqmME5IsWPKfSuV-i_E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnTiX4wo9Yw6SO9ZeG51YmA2gnkyywUtXUdPfo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOScYG7W5DhsZDd6OLzuXC1541978ynPHox3SiO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVRliD54q6hjFfh_sFVIxNwHheRCo7bDPNzpb5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtudRP1vYi2yp66AT_v6X4w-kWOX6wuIpI-WGi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4rwrmbcYakjkcbVuaOmbxktn0YlPzp8zNVoFe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuiurxCKOP7-IgZz-t0xZhh4r7j33KSj3FHDC0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZVDLfOl816ueKnW1VACjJ5YOwON9PdVvktN8J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLGUPwb7uAAP6PPu1HtDXojiXWmph-F4dJQhbs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIsizLL_7bsli73BQ3TqEZdUDx2pDww7lvVLHL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOd8WIu6KS_KJkHjfP52AvH-Hw8tYikSnSEqGcS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfJLmgHcHa3Zy4uaPmcf_YtZRilzCcLh7YmIbz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9</gmap_id></record>

I can usually find any electronic device that I need. This time I had to drive a little further, since my store was sold out. But they were nice enough to call San Marcos and they were able to put it on hold for us. It gave us the opportunity to visit a new location.
Every Fry's has a different thyme. I think this was inspired by Atlantis... With lots of aquariums! Very nice.
Fry's Electronics... you need to open a store in the (Inland Empire) San Bernardino, CA area!</review>

<Review>Went here for an iPhone case I needed in a hurry instead of a large blue and yellow establishment...what a waste of
time. Their phone case selection and cleanliness of this phone case area was embarrassing. Other parts of the store seems clean and stocked but man that was sad to see Fry’s electronics fall
So far from grace. At least they had some cool design to look at including a cafe with fish tanks for walls.<//Review>< Rate>

<Review>This Fry's is AMAZING! The Atlantis theme is so beautiful! They have these giant fish tanks with some beautiful  fish. Very relaxing to look at while having some coffee in their deli. Went looking for a TV and was mesmerized with the store! They do for the most part only carry super high quality TVs' but it's nice to see in real time what's hot. We were not bothered by salespeople which is a major plus!< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsvZUOBbNewk4gq389YapOudQ3lpe0GH_w4MM_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgSRSvPAxj205j46GlRVFob0hCh4R6Jwb4fZn1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnUzb4LcOhQMXu8orTIx6ZM4a52AB9fVohKNTK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

This used to be an amazing store. Now most of thier products are drop shipping items. Sad to see whoever did all their buying change so much. Please bring back reputable products! I also know COVID-19 ruined a lot of businesses.<//text>

Empty shelves throughout the entire store. 15 cars in the parking lot. I could hardly find a staff member. No customers. A ghost town. A staff member told me his future with Fry's is uncertain. Clearly brick and mortar is going away due to online sales.<//review>

Went here for an iPhone case I needed in a hurry instead of a large blue and yellow establishment...what a waste of
time. Their phone case selection and cleanliness of this phone case area was embarrassing. Other parts of the store seems clean and stocked but man that was sad to see Fry’s electronics fall
So far from grace. At least they had some cool design to look at including a cafe with fish tanks for walls.< /Review>

Under normal world circumstances I love Fry Electronics. However when I stopped by for a few small electronic repair items the shelves were bare. The store resembled an almost empty warehouse. Needless to say but I was disappointed. Hopefully they get their supply chains sorted out sooner rather than later.</Review>

<Review>I don't really understand it but this place has an incredible nautical theme. I'm assuming that it used to be an aquarium or something because it has some really elaborate decorations that I've never seen in other Fry's. Beyond the cool decorations this place has basically any electronic thing you'd ever want at a decent price. Make sure to stop here.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVjAmcADw-p6E8gqGnbzuVlGKK3FcIv49j3GhB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzyil4-QMegsjPx-52sxwmooUgKpaHYS7UcKh9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoZ-XZpFSgI_QNitKM9k5MNNvgprOEU7FB5Xz6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><rate>5</rate>< Name>

I felt creeped out just being inside and was not rewarded for showing up with any products I would ever want to buy. This store was dirty, empty, and poorly lit. The store was huge with almost no products on the shelves, and the few that were there looked like they had been there for years. It felt like I was walking down a dark alley the whole time I was inside.< /Review>

Lose a star for feeling like pulling teeth to get anyone to help you or answer questions, but the staff do know their stuff and were able to answer all questions that I had. My father in law who I went with asked for help finding something for screen mirroring options and he wad shown chromecast, the employee told him "this is what we've got" and just walked off. Another star lost for that. Employees are too busy talking to each other and do not seem motivated to be proactive with you, as highlighted in the other reviews below. So some improvement needed with customer service. They also have a small smoothie and coffee shop at the center, a well-maintained cylinder aquarium near the entrance, and overall a nice visual appearance to this store.</Text>

<Review>Absolutely awesome I had a great time the staff was knowledgeable in each department.
the environment is just a lot of fun to say the least
the layout of the store can be a bit confusing at times and can be somewhere overwhelming if there's something in particular you are looking for but if you're not bothered by this then you will most definitely be captivated by one of the many display items or interesting things they have while searching for whatever it is you are looking for definitely a fun experience but I wouldn't recommend it if you were trying to get in and out!</Review>< Pictures>

Wow. This place use to be amazing to visit. A warehouse of all electronics. It was truly a good shopping day in my book. However, now I entered the store but it was reminiscent of the grocery stores in Florida when a hurricane is coming. The shelves were bare and the place was empty. It's a shame but by the look inside, I couldn't imagine they will be around much longer</Review>

<text>A continous lack of inventory has turned Fry's from one of the happiest places on earth into a sad vacant cavernous space, that simply does not have wjatever it is that you are looking for.  After hitting a home run with their original mix that spanned everything high tech with the snacks to help out, they kissed just about every significant change in the retail space since.  First (and i. So many ways still) they missed the move to internet retail.  Missed the buy online and pickup in store symbiosis, the maker move... and so many more.  I have been there recently in search of PC parts, cable modems, car stereos, even a washing machine.  In all cases they didn't have what i needed... or even anything close.  I think o bought a USB C cable.  Which was nice, but I'm not sure you could even find that now.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Absolutely terrible store! Zero customer service, it’s a massive store with only 5 personnel working. Half the shelves are empty and very limited selection of TV’s. The store is poorly taken care of and looks like it’s falling apart. The floor is very cheap and half of it is not glued down. Do not go to this location!!< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
This place was a large empty building with less to offer than Walmart, seriously.  I used to shop Fry's in SD but haven't needed to make a trip in a while.  I went here for an OS and new Solid State internal drive.  The shelves were empty and the young man working the counter said to shop at Best Buy.< /Review>

I'm surprised that they are still open. Shelves are 95% empty with many aisles completely closed. Been like this for months. What a shame! This used to be my favorite electronics store. San Diego location is the same, nothing to sell and no one working there who appears to care about customers.< /Review>

Not what it used to be. Had not been here in a while and I was shocked when I got in. Empty shelves, no products on display, very limited selection. Demo rooms were gone. Very sad to see the current state of brick and mortar retail.</Text>

<text>Shelves were empty, staff few and far between. Wish we had turned around and left immediately. I was sold out of date and incorrect components, after two return visits they did fix it. It's such a shame, visits to frys used to be exciting and full of wonder, now its just sad.< /text>< pics>

This is an awesome Fry's location. I really liked the Atlantis theme of the store. The fish tanks are great!

Good section of items. Everything appeared to be in good order. Restrooms were well maintained.

The online price matching makes Fry's a great brick-and-mortar store to support for your electronics purchases, and this location is a fun one to check out!</text>

< Review>
Not restocking, but not going out of business? Incredibly empty, devoid of stock and customers. What things were there didn't make for much of a selection. There was an exhibit on desk/computer chairs and my Mother seemed to find a drain plug for a kitchen sink, so if you came to an electronics store looking for that, problem solved! Also, many speakers and karaoke machines, some of both bluetooth compatible. Really, if you're looking for anything, I advise anywhere else.</Review>

<review>This store is on its last legs and gasping for air.  Barely anything on the shelves, yet they cannot consolidate it to a smaller area to shop, so in typical Fry's fashion, you walk one end to the other to find one thing.  I was there to use an old gift card and wanted to get it done before they were closed for good, but 2 hours later I found one device I could actually use and got out of there as fast as I could.  It's sad and the end of an era.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>Rather depressing to see the state the store is in these days. Used to be crowded at all hours with a great selection of everything.

Last few times I've gone the selection has become less and less, they seem to be cutting back on the employee hours quite a bit as well, as it was a nightmare to find anyone able to provide assistance.

The associates I was able to track down were extremely helpful and knowledgeable, and basically bent over backwards to help me find the cables I was looking for.

Still a great store, just feels like its slowly getting phased out by its competitors.< /review>< username>

Fry's used to be a good place to get electronics, like computers and digital cameras, DVDs and music. Then, in a misguided attempt to be all things to all people, they expanded too fast into large appliances, furniture, and other hard goods. Music and movies, not so much. This Holiday season, the store is VERY poorly stocked, with very little merchandise to sell. One almost thinks they are going to close the store, they just haven't said so yet.< /Text>

It's like radio shack on crack. So many things to look at. If you are a gadget geek or just love electronics...this is the place for you. Each store has a theme, this one is the lost city of Atlantis so theres water stuff around the store, with a massive aquarium.</Text>

It's looks like the store is closing. Parts of the store are empty, most of their products are outdated, and they don't have a lot of customers. On the other hand, if you need something to do around this area, you should visit this store. The ocean/water themed decorations are very interesting. It's seemed more like a museum than a store to me. They even have a theater and many aquariums.< /Text>

It's a huge electronics store with a section for everything and plenty of great sales, which is awesome enough. But there are also fish tanks by the entrance and in the walls of the cafe, which is a great place to get a fresh smoothie. Stop by the massage recliner section to "test them out" and it's not even a Fry's anymore, it's a tropical vacation.< /Text>

They look like they are going out of business. No inventory in a Huge store. I got some line about the trade war with China and getting different suppliers bit they look done. Too bad. I enjoyed Fry's in the past.<//review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Was excited to go there today and take my daughter.  they always had my components i needed for DIY electronics projects it was sad to see everything gone. no video cards. no components. not even any video games. even the staff was scarce. I finally asked someone what is going on. he smiled and replied "i don't know what you mean" like nothing was going on. At least my daughter and i got to see the Fish and Jacobs ladders one last time. Its sad to see the end of an era. I used to spend hours wandering around looking at practically everything. RIP Fry's you will definitely be missed.<//Review><Time>1573432922841< /Time>< gmapID>

Empty shelves throughout the entire store. 15 cars in the parking lot. I could hardly find a staff member. No customers. A ghost town. A staff member told me his future with Fry's is uncertain. Clearly brick and mortar is going away due to online sales.< /text>

I just needed a simple USB to USB C cable. I went to BestBuy and was told I needed to order online and it would be brought out of the store within an hour. I didnt have time to wait around so I went to Fry's on Bent. I was able to walk right in, get my cable, and I was out the door. Thank you Fry's!< /Text>

What happened? Fry's has always had a huge selection. Great for when you wanted to see things in person. The shelves are bare and it looks like it's closing.</Text>

Another one bits the dust. It is there but really shouldn't be. They have not restocked any items and are telling everyone they are changing vendors (for 3 months now). The fish tanks have not been cleaned in a while and might be considered cruel and unusual punishment for the fish.< /Review>

This used to be the place to go if you liked building your own computer. Store was mostly empty when I last went there. It is only a matter of time before they go out of business.< /review>

There's nothing left in store. It's a shell of what it used to be. So sad to see such a great place be reduced to memory< /Review>

<review>They only price match products sold by Amazon. If it's sold by a third party they will not price match.

Place was a ghost town. Best part is checking out the various fish aquariums. Hate to say it but this place is a victim of Amazon's success. Visit while you can.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6KwXC-lQHo3RSGTw4W8Vz_Cbwus4djxBT38JM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Unpleasant experience on Tues. 08/20/19. Bought a stereo  with turn table and no stylist from Fry's and bought a stylist also from Fry's previously. At that time, told Fry's could install it.  On Tues. came in with it to have installed, you
couldn't do it. The gentleman behind the counter nice and tried but another employee rudely said can't do it. We had the Geek Squad  come out to our place today, Fri., 08/23/19, charged only $50.00 and installed no problem.< /text>

I hope they they won't totally disappear from the radar. It's nice to see what you're physically buying. At the same time, you can always refund of exchange on the spot</text>

Good selection, good prices. Terrible service. It might also be a good idea to have more than 1or 2 people on the cash registers when there are 30 people in line. Ask a sales person to help you, and after the dirty look, they will act like they are doing you a huge favor. Maybe thats just my experience. Good Prices. Good Selection. Good Prices.< /Review>

These places have really taken a hit since Amazon has taken over. It feels a little bit like the giant warehouse where the Ark of the Covenant is being stored in Indiana Jones. BUT, the selection of products is much better than Best Buy. It will be a problem if these stores close because of Amazon because sometimes you need gear same-day!< /Text>

I went in to Fry's in San Marcos to get two things a new GPS and a printer I waited 15 minutes before somebody helped me with the GPS and then they didn't have any and then I went over to the printer department and I waited 10 minutes for someone to help me and the guy was standing over there by on his phone and wouldn't even look around to see if there was customers as far as I'm concerned this store has turned from a good store to a POS store. I'm not sure if the store is closing or not but every time I go in there the store has got less and less items throughout the store and they're not saying anything to anybody about it so it's just not a good experience in there anymore< /text>

Let’s start with the staff!!! I asked a Lady walking the store whom was a manger where something was. She pointed to the area and said “over there.” I asked her to show me and take me there and it was like I just asked her to read War and Peace. After reluctantly doing so, I asked her to help me find the product. Before even looking she said “we probably don’t have it.” No I said, you do, it says you have 5 on hand. After that comment she was heated. I liked seeing how “hard” she was working, so I even throw in a another smart comment that went a little like this: “you guys love to point people in a direction and let them fend for themselves, don’t you?” With no answer I said, “see... how could I find the item, if you can’t find the item?” At this point she was overly mad, and hating her job, so I felt the need to push one further step. I said, “if you don’t want to help customers find an item, why do you work in customer service?” Once again I didn’t get an answer. If this is how management treats customers, I can only imagine how much their employees care. Only reason you can’t 100% avoid, is because the store (not the employees) may have something you need and you don’t or can’t wait. If another store has the item, go there!!! Even Walmart.</review>

Epic sized store with any and every up to date electronic device or apparatus you could ever want or need. The store is very clean and also has a place to sit down and eat if you want to order food. The selections and options are diverse and plentiful. The parking lot is large and always has open spots available. Most importantly though they do have the best prices and they will match internet pricing as well. Other places won't do that.< /Review>

Due to the issues going on with the tariffs, they don't have much stock of electronics.  I will say it was nice not to be chased after by a salesperson in the computer department!  I actually got to just look around, and found someone when I needed help😊< /review>

I used to buy only from Fry's. They recently had given me the worst service I have ever gotten so far.

I had purchased a headset and a warranty with it.(not the same location but irrelevant for what happened) Not only did they were not able to retrieve my information because they didn't put in all my correct info which would have made this process and issue non-existent. But they once again screwed up looking up the wrong name and info which wasted both of our times. I even spelt my name 3 times and given my i.d. more times than that AND THEY STILL LOOKED UP THE WRONG NAME.

The service representative was just frustrated to the point where he just wanted to give up and send me away. Also, he tried incriminating me into his words saying I said things which were never said. Shady to a T.

I was once a loyal customer with a history of major purchases. No more. You guys don't care about fixing your mistakes. Otherwise, I wouldn't be taking my time to write this.</Text>

Bare isles. I thought they were going out of business. Barely 1/4 of the placed was stocked. Large empty areas without store shelves. Their reply? "We're changing venders."  This was during Christmas. If they're not going out of business, management picked a bad time to change venders.  Their products have odd naming techniques, especially computers and laptops; In taking about name brand stuff.  Most products listed for Christmas were refurbished or opened or clearance items. Looks like they're going out of business. I'd steer clear for warranty and product value sake alone.<//Text>

Whatever you remember fry's electronic's as being you can forget about it.

There is no inventory, the employees walk around, (what few are there) looking at their phones wondering if their job application to some other place has been approved.  You can't even buy a micro SD card in this place don't waste your time.

If I could rate with zero stars I would.<//Review>

The entire store was almost devoid of inventory on this visit, not too mention other shoppers, which was really shocking considering we were there on a Sunday afternoon. It was a ghost town; my wife and I saw maybe five other customers roaming about and exactly ONE register open.<//Review>

<Review>fry's seems to be more empty than usual not just with the shelves but also with the place. the items are just too pricy for cheap items. it's more like the water down version of best buy. the only saving grace for fry's are their individual component parts and the robotics section. they should just change to Radio Shack.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I give Fry's a 5 star not for how it is today, but how it once was.

I remember when I first moved to California and saw a Fry's for the first time. The massive Jacobs ladder running, the Cafe was bustling, the Deep see diver tanks lively and epic with the wall waterfalls, and the fish tanks full of such exotic looking fish and even a shark at one point. An electronic store that had so much, everything you could ever think of or want.

Their computer repair service was awesome, and they would hold classes to help teach you how to build your own PC. The staff were intuitive, knowledgeable and caring. And again, you could find EVERYTHING. Are you gamer? Upgrade your rig, get a new game, Mt. Dew and snack aisle right there for binge gaming. Need a fridge? Done. Are you a baker? Bam every kitchen appliance from overs, to mixing bowls to espresso machines. Everything.

This store was so phenomenal and was a great introduction to this franchise and the state of Cali as well. It had easily become my favorite location and my wife and I met so many great employees here.

Sadly the store has become a husk of itself. I have seen this so many times and its heart breaking to see so many shelves empty or removed. Fewer employees than ever and most seem to know an end is near even if they wont voice it. Their actions speak all. The fact that the Register numbers in the back row of the check out counter and all but 10 of the register computers are gone says they wont make it to the holiday season and they know it.

I have read all over that its not just this one but all Fry's locations are going through this. Its a classic sign of the end of a great franchise. I will miss them so when they are finally gone, and am waiting for an official announcement, but until then I will continue to try to support my favorite store until alas their doors close once and for all.< /text>

I always enjoy browsing at Fry's, but I moved from Mountain View, CA where there are several Fry's stores that provide raw material for all sorts of DIY projects.  The selection at the San Marcos Fry's includes less true Maker material.  It is a HUGE store packed with good values, but I couldn't find the connectors I was looking for: 5.5mm x 2.1mm DC Panel Mounts.< /Review>

<Review>Always look forward to enjoying Fry's.  I find their personnel to be helpful and knowledgible.   And fun to look at all the gadgets and buy a few.   Good stuff.< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< Date>

I went during an awkward phase. There's a large cylindrical fish tank and other walls of fish tanks in the floor plan. I think it's supposed to be mythical Greek in theme. But because they were in the middle of management change, it appeared like the place was closing. I was wandering around with about 7 other people in this large building, and we all looked lost and confused. I'm sure it would be a great after the change of hands.<//review>

A lot of empty shelves, very few basic components any more. Kind a sad shadow of its former usefulness.< /Text>

Quite a spooky store, even the employees looked dead inside. Overall, I'd say it is one of the better haunted attractions to check out during October.< /text>

Great customer service. I looked for particular aux cable for long time couldn't find it nowhere even in best buy.
I went to Fry's electronics and found it right away it's working great. Thank you!< /review>

<Review>I’ve been here a few times with computer questions and it always seems like the staff here is very... disinterested in helping. They aren’t rude, but they definitely don’t go the extra mile to make sure you leave satisfied. I don’t recommend showing up with questions. Apparently Fry’s is a place to buy, not inquire. Find out what you need ahead of time on YouTube or elsewhere on the Internet, then pop in and grab it. That said, their selection is immense, so whatever you need they probably have it.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Gmap_id>

<Text>There isn't much they don't have, actually have competitive prices. Just go in with knowledge of what you want. Staff there is trying to make a sale, also if building a computer, it seems they don't know about compatibility. Definitely go in there with a good understanding of what you need!< /Text>< Pics>

Lots of items that you can't find elsewhere; electronic components, build your own computer components, sold on TV items, toys, video games, books, DVDs, phones, appliances, and much more. Nice cafe.

This used to be one of my favorite stores,  until they changed their model and now it's a ghost town.  Zero selection of anything and mostly empty shelves.  I came back twice in the last few months to see if they had solved their problem.  But no... and worse yet, the staff could care less.  I asked the only one employee I saw walking around if he had heard of any new updates on the store going back to normal and he laughed and said it looks fine to me'.   On the way out I said to the security guy that sits by the door and checks receipts, that it's depressing.  He looked at me with a uncaring state and said why tell me?  ...because there is no one else.  He said, well ask them.  Them?  Dont you work here?  Well I dont know anything.  Ok then.

Frys for now is dead, with not much of consequence to sell.  Dont waste your time.<//text>

Now that Radio Shack is gone, Fry's should be more appealing, yet somehow it isn't. They have a good selection, but somehow just not what I'm looking for. At least thee salespeople are no longer so aggressive to get credit for anything you purchase.</Review>

<Review>This place has a weird vibe, like it should be a casino or something. There's a cafe in the middle of the store, and there's an office/gaming chair farm. Genuinely feels like an aesthetic distopia. There's are fish tanks and fountains with water running upwards!
All that said, the store has just about everything you'd want for electronics and accessories. Pricing is good, service is top notch. Floor workers will be as involved as you'd like. Would recommend over other places like Best Buy.</Review><user_name>Curt Self<//user_name><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

<username>Terry Lynne Wolfe<//username><review>This particular Fry's lacks a friendly staff. They seem paranoid that Customers are up to no good. You just sense it.  There are some knowledgable reps, but many are not. I've had to seek out the more knowledgable ones for assistance. The store is also very sparce. We used to get our larger electronic purchases there, but have switched to another local large store. I'm sorry to say that I'm just not so comfortable with large purchases there anymore. Even when I drive by, there are very few cars in the lot, not like in the past. I don't expect this particular store to be there too much longer unless they turn it around.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<text>HUGE store! They carry just about anything that plugs in, and many things that don't, like office furniture, games, and exercise equipment. Unlike other brick and mortar stores these days, Fry's also has a decent selection of small components and accessories for building computers, gaming systems, and fixing electronics. They also price match, including online. There is one major downside however...many of the employees think they are knowledgeable and electronics savvy, but many of them are not. I strongly recommend that you research what you need before you go, or better yet, bring someone who is knowledgeable with you. Any time I have asked for help simply locating a specific product in the store, the employee has tried to talk me into getting something else that wasn't going to solve my issue. Very annoying and a waste of time. As for major electronics, like laptops, computers, phones, and such, we'll stick with Costco. That said, we probably pop over once a month for something we couldn't find elsewhere.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< userid>

Disneyland for electronics, but somehow their inventory has dwindled in recent years. Lots open floor space in some areas with nothing to fill it. Significantly smaller selection of Apple computers and displays than in years past. Used to be an easy five stars, but this location needs some work.</Text>

<Review>I give Fry's an E for effort. It doesn't look like it's doing well but when I need something right now for PC\electronic repairs I can probably get it here. The aquariums are nice and we always stop by to see the striped eel.</Review>< rate>

<Text>Great deals, BUT racist jerks are a deterrent. I spent two hours gift shopping, combing the aisles picking JUST the right thing for so many loved ones big and small. Customer service?? Not one employee asked me if I needed help - not one. I was in there two hours and DID ask three employees for help. I made my purchase but the dude at the exit podium relentlessly combed through my very full cart and the receipt for what must have been TWELVE MINUTES. He brought his highlighter into the game during the third run, and as he started the sixth round he asked me if I knew which item in the cart matched the SKU he was pointing to on the receipt! I decided to take the fruit of my labor back to the register so he could keep running his hands over them all night. I was dog tired and this poor unfortunate soul cheerfully let ALL THE WHITE PEOPLE pass with a nod and a smile, one of which stood beside me admiring this man's attention to detail. He tried to make a joke but this wasn't funny. It was humiliating and a waste of time. Oh well, Amazon delivers for free.< /Text>< pictures>

Many shelves cleared out, outragouselt high price for a GoPro battery and nobody around to answer questions.  After being a very long time customer, I left to go to Walmart.  And I hate Walmart!  Walmart had the same, exact item I needed for $20 that Fry's was asking $45!  Sad!<//text>

<review>Honestly my favorite electronics store. My only problem is that there is no one to help you find what you're looking for, and if you do find someone to help, they are almost as clueless as the customer. Other than that, great aesthetic.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< user>

<rate>4</rate><text>As far as electronics goes, they have mostly everything I need. Even if I don't purchase anything during my visits, I can personally see the quality, options, and accessories a piece of equipment may come with. It sure beats the hassle of buying something online, being disappointed, then having to return the product and having to do it all over again. Big box stores still have a place in our society and Fry's is an example of this.

This location is normally pretty quiet and clean but be aware of open products. It seams that people like to open sealed packages to check the contents. But rather than purchasing the package they opened, they tend to put that one back and purchase another unopened item.

Black Friday here is insane but I learned that if your not one to wait in line for the door Buster's, they may still have the product you want if you stroll in during regular store hours. This all depends on the product you are looking for so don't try this for an item that is highly sought out for.

Make sure you sign up for their promo codes too. This can and will save you a lot of money when purchasing certain items. Once signed up just keep an eye on your email, some items are only discounted for single days and are usually in limited quantity.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>What used to be the best place to get anything for my computer has become just somewhere to go when you don't want to wait a day or two for Amazon. They have a decent selection for most items you need, but can be lacking in other areas. Stay away from any open box items, when an item is returned they usually just throw a sticker on it for a small amount off and put it back on the shelf. The shakes and sandwiches in the Cafe are good. The prices are usually comparable and be sure to search up the price online as they do price match internet prices, but they will be picky about the source.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>This location has been going downhill for a while now. The employees are merely collecting paychecks. In my opinion, they should invest those checks into etiquette lessons if not actual finishing schools.
There is no organization to what limited stock is occasionally available.

This particular Fry's lacks a friendly staff. They seem paranoid that Customers are up to no good. You just sense it.  There are some knowledgable reps, but many are not. I've had to seek out the more knowledgable ones for assistance. The store is also very sparce. We used to get our larger electronic purchases there, but have switched to another local large store. I'm sorry to say that I'm just not so comfortable with large purchases there anymore. Even when I drive by, there are very few cars in the lot, not like in the past. I don't expect this particular store to be there too much longer unless they turn it around.< /Review>

<Text>Hopefully it's just the covid 19 effecting retailers, but had nothing in stock. The shelves where bare and staff was difficult to find. The one or two people we could find, didn't work in the department we were looking in so weren't very knowledgeable. Left without buying anything.< /Text>< time>

Great place to get the parts you need. Enough computer components you can walk in and put together a PC in one visit. Other consumer electronics,  and retail products available as well if you're interested in that kind of stuff.</text>

<Review>The prices for electronics and other items is great, however, the store is greatly unorganized and there is almost never anyone there to help you find what you need. In the store, they have assistance desks, but the people working there (usually men) don't even know where stuff is in the store. Again, the price is pretty good, and they have great after Thanksgiving sales, but you could easily find the same stuff on Amazon.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Fry's has a lot of good merchandise in it stuff I wasn't even expecting like washers and dryers and refrigerators and all that was in there it's huge if you're looking for stuff I would go to Fry's especially hard to find stuff they've got a lot of unique items over there a lot of stuff that's real real hard to find they have. The service guys that are there to help you the one I had to deal with he told me absolutely positively the store doesn't carry the item I was looking for yet there it was on the Shelf I just kept looking I was very persistent in my search pretty item and I found it. I don't know if it's just the one representative or if that's the way that the people in that store are the checkout person was very very friendly and she know her stuff but the guy in the back and the electronics department specifically the phone area didn't seem to know what he was talking about with his stuff cuz I found what I was looking for but other than that I give frost a thumbs up.</Review>

<text>I've used Frys as my go to local store for nearly everything electronic, technical or gadget for more than 20 years.  Upon arriving to purchase 2 normal cables (a 10' 15pin vga & a 6' usb extension) neither was in stock.  In fact there were DOZENS of completely empty aisles where cables & components used to be.  I will be very surprised if either Frys in San Diego County is open by March 2020.</text><Rate>2< /Rate><pictures>None</pictures><Gmap_id>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9<//Gmap_id>< date>

I love this Fry's when I moved here due to the computer parts  but recently they started to lose inventory. I asked an employee and they said it was due to a vendor switch.< /review>

I had to go back to the store three different times to get a phone charging cord. One said six foot cord but was a three foot cord inside of the package. The second trip I purchased a different cord and it did not work so I had to return for the third cord. With both returns I had issues at the customer service return desk questing my honesty. Be careful shopping at Fry's because if you purchase the wrong item or it's not what you want or need you will get a hassle on the return.</Text>

Fry’s Electronics treats its employees as expenditures. I don’t know if it’s just the location or if the poor management runs rampant company wide. The way employees are treated makes the company ripe

Where they used to sell cd's and dvd's is now KNOCK-OFF COLOGNE & PERFUME -- so utterly ridiculous. How much lower can this store/company sink?

<Review>Really sad what happened to Fry's... This used to be a place you could spend hours, it was very exciting to shop there. I went last week, hearing they are closing, thinking I would find deals but the store seemed to be in "suspended liquidation." Most shelves were empty with all popular items gone, what remained was not discounted at all, and what was left were only the items that got bad reviews or were overpriced or obsolete. Some small items I took to the register rang up for more than what was posted on the shelf and they wouldn't adjust it. Only giving them 2 stars because I had so many good experiences there over the past 20 years. Save yourself the time, its not worth visiting Fry's anymore.< /Review>< user_id>

I was shocked when I walked in and saw the place so empty. Hardly any employees, hardly any customers and worse of all many shelves were empty. I did end up purchasing a small drone for my son but to no surprise it was broken.< /Review>

<Name>Jermaine Knew< /Name><Text>A year ago I would have recommended this place.
They are literally not buying any more inventory and most of the stuff they're selling are things that have been returned already.
I went to build a new gaming rig, as i have done before, and they only had one option for a motherboard.
All of their shelves were empty.
They are going out of business and lying about it.
I had to make 2 additional trips back to this place, once to exchange the chassis for one that was compatible with the only motherboard they got (the salesperson told me it would work fine). Then once again to get the whole rig working only after I threatened to return the whole thing the store manager allowed the service department to do exactly what they knew to do to get the one motherboard they have left working, AND also to return the laptop harddrive he sold me that I could not use in this rig.
IF this place is still here, I would not recommend it.< /Text>< user_id>

Put my store out of business back in 2004.  I guess amazon is doing the same to them.  Selection is trash and the service was worse.  Not recommended.</review>

<Review>It appears they are 1 step fro closing the front door. Shelves are bare , only saw maybe 4 employees throughout the entire store. When asked what was happening they were very hesitant to say.  As I wondered the floor , all was thinking was what if you purchased something they still had and had problem with it and went back for support, the doors maybe pad locked. The computer tech person gave me a we getting all new suppliers when I asked what was up.  I am not sure maybe just this location.< /Review>< user_name>

<Text>Customer service could be better in the electronic section of the store. Was there to buy a laptop, saw three sales clerks talking to one customer. Waited and waited, when we did see someone that was not with a customer, he stated that he was busy. OK. The hell with you and this dying store, went to best buy picked up a laptop, desktop, and printer. Thank you for showing me the way to a better store.<//Text>< pictures>

Has a fair selection of electronics that you would find here for a better price than at a computer shop. I usually just get accessories for my electronics that I have and so far I've been satisfied with my purchases. Customer service is great and they do what they can to assist you with what you are looking for, even if it means searching the web for a better deal/options.<//Review>

First time to visit the store. It was more than what I imagined. Though we couldn't find what we were looking for because they don't carry Lenovo products. But I loved their games collection. Though I think buying online is more convenient than in store. Especially when meeting with unmotivated staffs.<//Text>

LOVE this store --- the best lit Fry's I've been in and their background music is at a lower volume.  Yippee!  The folks that work there are very helpful and friendly and I shop there quite often --- usually once or more a week.  My only suggestion to them is to add a few benches for us folks who use canes to rest on in this huge store since they don't provide riding carts for us.</Text>

One star is 1 to many. They advertise "We match internet prices"  the great big banner says right on the front of the building. What it should say is  we might match some depending on what mood we are in. It is complete fraud, and karma will find those that work there and get them in the end. Never will return there again. Not worth the hassle and the drive<//Text>

Very sad to walk into the store and see hardly any merchandise and even fewer customers. Walked through the whole store and not one employee asked if we needed help. Surprised the store is still open, didn't even have Black Friday stock. Too bad there isn't better management and vision for the store. It will be missed.< /review>

<text>This store needs credit for what it is.  It is a giant electronics store with an amazing selection.  They also have good prices and the ability to match online prices.  I actually like to see products before I buy them, this is one of the last few stores left to do that.  I have shopped here for years and have some good and some not so good experiences, but they usually make it right.  They do have knowledgeable staff which is rare these days in retail.</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<time>1547761321098<//time><Rate>4< /Rate><text>Great customer service in the store. Employees are nice and usually know what they are talking about. They don't try and pressure you into buying anything. Overall the store is awesome and the employees make for a great experience in person.

The customer service over the phone is less then adequate, expect 20min wait times before an employee will answer who will then transfer you and you will have to wait again. I've called 5 times in the past 2 days wasting a couple hours on the phone, the first time i got connected with a guy who had no idea what he was talking about and gave me some bogus info, he said if it didn't work I'd have to come in to the store, it didn't work. I simply needed to be connected to a sales manager who assured me he would send me some promotion codes for buying a new graphics card.

The next two times i called after a 30 min wait time nobody was answering in the department so the customer service put in a ticket with my information and told me i would be contacted shortly, which never happened.

I called again and finally got connected to the right department but the manager wasn't there.  An employee took my info and told me he had no idea when I might get my promo codes. The only reason i chose FRY's was because they offered the codes.

Currently I'm still calling for the codes and have had no luck, I wouldn't bother usually but its over a 100 bucks in video games I'd be missing out on.

Finally emailed the store manager with the details and had my promotional codes within a couple hours.</text>< pics>

if i could i give this store 0 stars, i would. the management here doesn’t understand how to treat their employees like human beings. let alone the customers. everyday before and after you go home they have to bag check every single employee to see if they’ve stolen something. making them feel like thieves, not associates. if you bring a charging cable from home, they’ll accuse you of theft. even after overworking you, they’ll threaten you to do overtime on your days off just because their understaffed. the store manager needs to improve on better management skills and learn how to treat their employees like the hard working people they are, not slaves. shame on the manager and his lack of any benefits. your employees and customers are not the problem for the corruptness of fry’s. i will not support their lack of good customer service and working environment for anyone.<//review>

Fry’s has been the place to shop electronics. It’s a similar place to Best Buy and like a Radio Shack on steroids. Great selection on computers, computer parts, printers and all accessories for computers and gamers. Wide selection in tv’s, car audio and home appliances. Very competitive pricing. Will match internet prices last time I went.
Huge aquarium. It’s just nice to see so many fish in a huge glass tank.
You will also find many other products for home, car or office. Highly recommended.
I like the San Marcos Blvd Store.

If what I wrote helped you out, please give me a like. Thanks.<//Text>

The greeters, cashiers and customer service people are helpful. Unfortunately most of the department "specialists" are not much help. I'd recommend doing your own research if you need help figuring out what you need. Otherwise, the deals are pretty good​ and they do price match. Although one employee asked me to sign into my own Amazon Prime account on their computer in order to give me the price match.< /text>

<review>Why buy electronics especially computers anywhere else when this place is far cheaper? I purchased my second computer here 2 months ago after doing research in prices.  I found it $323 cheaper here!    This place is the best for electronics, period.

< Review>
Great Service Check-Out.
But had go back return toaster, associate return it great but ask that my refund and she said yes.  Then i ask her if I get refund for the warranty and she totally forgot. she didn't look really good receipt that i purchase just one "1" item and warranty.
If I didn't look at the receipt before i left the store there will be issue warranty get refund.

Not alot selection of toaster, was to small that I was looking for.

EVERYONE PLEASE LOOK AT YOUR RECEIPT BEFORE RETURN AND SEE IF YOU GET FULL REFUND BACK WITH WARRANTY.</Review>

Huge store, but the shelves are half empty. I followed the giant signs to the Hard Drive section, but they only had a handful of SSD to choose from, and none larger than 512gb. Staff was friendly, but hard to find.</review>

Probably the biggest "electronics store" I have ever seen. I use quotation as they sell much more, toys, exercise equipment, have a cafe inside and very unique artwork and water features inside. Had exactly what we needed to finish a job in San Diego since we were shipped UK power adapters for a big project. Probably the size of a super Walmart, but did take 4 different staff members to help find what we needed.</Text>

There are some small ticket item deals but the store experience I loved for a decade seems gone. I read somewhere they lost their credit and that means I likely they can ever come back. I must have written the prior 5-star review more than 2 yrs ago:  ""Terrific selection service value, though a half star off previous years still the best of several genre!"</review><Time>1612278659340<//Time><gmapID>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9</gmapID>< resp>

I think this location is not far from closing.  The shelves are bare.  Lots of open space with no produts.  They do not seem to be restocking a lot of inventory.< /Text>

I tend to like Fry's other than the fact I'm always tempted to spend more money than I want. They usually have some decent sales and I don't think you'll find a better available selection anywhere else. Not to mention any names..cough cough...Best Buy</Text>

<review>I just went to this store today and some of the employees weren't really helpful. One of them was kind of rude. At around 7pm, my friend and I wanted to inquire about their exercise equipments.

We went up to 4 employees in the Computer Department that were too busy talking & laughing with each other to help us out. One of them said that the exercise equipments weren't their department. Uhm. Okay? I was expecting him to at least call or walk us to an employee that works in the department. Instead we had to wander around the store and do it our own.

A few minutes later, we found another employee that tried to look in the back to see if a specific equipment was in stock and she took FOREVER. We just decided that it wasn't worth the wait and just left.

I would like to see an improvement with the customer service of most (if not all) the employees at this store. It's sad to see most of them unhappy with their job. I at least enjoyed the beautiful ocean-themed layout of the store.<//review>< Name>

<rate>1< /rate><text>I used to love going to Fry's. It was always a fun experience checking out the giant fishtanks and browsing the vast inventory. I could always find some obscure movie or CD and enjoy people watching with crowds on Saturday afternoon. That was four years ago.
I went back today to show my 10 year old what an awesome place Fry's was and browse the CDs and DVDs . We were completely disappointed. Not only did they have virtually no CDs or DVDs, half the shelves in the entire store were empty. On a Saturday afternoon there was one register out of twenty open and maybe a dozen customers in the store. How they are still in business like this is beyond my understanding. I don't expect it to remain around much longer. I have no reason to ever go there again. It's a shame.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>It's a very large store, with a ton of products.  The only issue is, products are not well laid out and are inter mixed with dissimilar items. this makes it very difficult to find things when half the aisle is dedicated to one product that has no business with the other half of the aisle.</Text>< Pics>

Prices range from decent to terrible but they do offer price matching. Sections of the store look like they've been abandoned, left to the elderly to buy the things that are no longer wanted like car audio. Not sure if the store will be around much longer.<//Text>

We don't have a Fry's where I'm from and I used to frequent radio shack. I was looking for some electronics components to fix my microwave and my buddy said just go to Fry's. I of course had no idea what he was talking about, but decided I'd go anyways. I walked in there with the intention of buying two or three small components and I walked out with over $300 dollars of gear. This store is the coolest store I've ever been in. Some of the prices can be a bit high but they will have sales that are unbelievable. If you are looking for almost anything technology related chances are they'll have it. Are you trying to build your first pc? They're employee's in that department are pretty knowledgeable and will help you find the best bang for your buck. I would recommend this store to anyone who asks about it. 10/10 will shop at again.<//Text>

Just awful retail experience every time in this store.  Audio guys are always BLASTING techno or hip hop music. It’s so loud you can’t even think.  I’m in my early 30’s and am used to loud music but not when shopping.  They aren’t playing it for a customer demo but rather for their own enjoyment.  This is a consistent problem with this store.  The staff in the TV department aren’t very knowledgeable and struggle to communicate. Prices are low, but are often beat by the internet.  When you go to price guarantee they make it difficult. Never going back, it too painful of an experience.</Text>

Would have been 5 but had to go to multiple employees to track down the small appliance sales rep, in order to open the cellphone lock-up.

Side note: it is quite an indictment on our society, the level of "chain of custody" that this phone took in the name of "loss prevention"<//Text>

They only price match products sold by Amazon. If it's sold by a third party they will not price match.

Place was a ghost town. Best part is checking out the various fish aquariums. Hate to say it but this place is a victim of Amazon's success. Visit while you can.</Text>

<text>I've been coming to this Fry's electronics since it opened and I have never had a complaint other than the usual Fry's stuff like watching for open-box items and being smart about your purchases as the staff is usually incentivized to upsell.. however I'm not sure how long this Fry's is going to be here because as of late it really seems like their stock is thinning out and their isles have tons of fillers and repeat items.. this is the reason for my four stars not 5... I do hope they survive but as of right now I'm just not sure.. I still recommend them however don't expect the selection they used to have.. if things turn around I will definitely update my review and increase the star back to 5 😉<//text><Date>1554391100069</Date>< Name>

To be fully honest, i have had better experiences at Fry’s Electronics. They don’t seem to care about the customers as before and also for their shelves. Way to many empty shelves. When i asked if they had any on stock and they replied with “ no we have been out for a while and i don’t know when we will have any on stock”. Thats a sad thing for an electronics store. Sadly it seems like another “Radio Shack” is about to happen.😕😕< /Text>

The ambiance of the store was nice. They had big aquariums and nice displays. They even had a little cafe which was over priced but nice. Their prices were not as good as best buys. But it was a nice experience to walk around the store and the staff was friendly.< /text>

They didn't have anything I needed. They place was dead. Hardly any staff. Most of the stock pegs were empty. Many shelves completely empty. Looked like they were going out of business. I left empty handed.</Text>

<Time>1553413069516< /Time><Text>Awesome! Wish I remembered the bubbly blonde woman that helped me over by the stun guns which I had no idea they even sold! Lol. She was amazing tho! Helped me find everything I needed and they were just about to close! Needless to say I actually got everything that I came there for which just so happened to all be on opposite sides of the store! Never would have been able to do it without her! Oh and the guy who was worried about his calculus exam! Hope that you passed! Those two made my day!

With the exception of one particularly helpful employee in customer service who assisted me in finding and ensuring the correct device was the one I walked away with, nearly half a dozen other interactions left me with rude or dismissive Associates. Nearly every interaction I had with an employee there was unsatisfactory and unhelpful. I recommend this place only if you know exactly what you need and exactly where to get it otherwise you're on your own.<//review>

<Text>Love this place. It has everything one could want in electronics, TV's and games. The sales staff is informative and kind. The place is lit inside nice and bright with merchandise nicely displayed. Its too bad theyre so pricey, i just go somewhere else to buy it or get it online from Amazon.</Text>< user_id>

I called ahead to find out if the store had specific office supplies. Rep let me know they did but when I got there I found out the supply was VERY limited. Most of the spiral notebooks are bent up or have stains on them. Very frustrating lack of communication.< /Review>

This place SUCKS. I remember when it was a great place to buy electronics. Couldn’t get help when looking for help then when having to return the item that didn’t work because I couldn’t get an answer from an employee I had to stand in line for 25 minutes to return it even though I had all receipts. I would easily take the 1 mile drive down to Best Buy where I am greeted and questions easily answered.</review>

If you like computers or gadgets or audio visual stuff or even appliances, Fry's is the place to visit. They always have good sales too. Some are huge bargains. The stuff you see on eBay from China can be found here as well as the main brands. They have many varieties to choose from too. Don't ever go to Best Buy, that place is for suckers who don't mind paying full retail price. Fry's is like buying online (prices) but in-store touch, feel, examine closely and tryout. I just wish they would expand to everywhere.< /review>

Fry's has gradually declined over the years. They used to be the go-to spot for PC parts but now most of the shelves are half stocked. Don't waist your time in this store. You're better off just shopping for it online</text>

<review>The building itself is amazing with the whole "Lost city of Atlantis theme going on".
The employees are very helpful and always smiling, they are attentive to their customers and the stores upkeep. It is very nice to visit this Fry's for almost any thing.
They have a nice little cafe in the center.
The store is pretty big and carries a wide variety of merchandise.
They always have some pretty good sales and clearance in all departments it's great.< /review>< pictures>

Huge store, they will have every electronic you can think of. From kitchen appliances,  tvs, computers, and sound systems. They have it all. When I went, their audio room wasn't fully setup so I didn't get to sample as many sound systems that I would have liked. Staff is helpful and everything is reasonably priced.<//review>

Customer service is slow here but professional.  Only gave 2 stars because it takes a while to find out if what is on display is actually available.  If you don't have to deal with any assistance then you will enjoy the visit. Fry's has a lot of useful stuff at good prices.<//Review>

Prices seemed fine and they currently match major online sellers. The store really had most everything you could want, but had a very chaotic layout and was huge. All around fun though! I like the large saltwater fish tanks set up throughout.< /Text>

< review>
4 star store, 1 star service. Went in to spend ~1100$ on a computer build, knew which pieces I wanted, just had to find them.
An employee was helping a son and father put together their build so when I couldn't find some of the pieces I walked over to 2 other employees, 1 was unloading boxes and another was staring at the computer, so I approached the fat, balding guy at the computer. "Excuse me, sir"... guy doesn't flinch or move, or recognize me in anyway, so I stand there staring at him for a bit waiting for a response: "someone else will help you, unless you have a quick question." So I ask if they're out of a certain kind of motherboard, a pretty quick question in my opinion, and he responds with "yeah someone else will help you."  Then goes back to staring at the computer. Doesn't ask the box guy to help me, doesn't notify the guy helping the father/son that I need help, doesn't call for another employee.
After waiting a few more minutes I asked the employee, who's already busy helping a customer, if theyre out. He tells me if it's not on the shelf, they're out. Not sure why the guy at the computer couldn't say that. Walked right out, I'll spend my money elsewhere if they're not interested in my business.< /review>

Great if you're looking for something specific and don't care about the price. Usually has the latest and greatest tech. Certain departments need to be more knowledgeable about their products.

Positives

-Expansive inventory
-Niche PC hardware not carried by other big box stores
-Friendly staff

Negatives

-None competitive pricing
-Old inventory that isn't discounted
-store organization can be lacking

I have had positive, negative, and overall neutral experiences here. In most cases the staff is friendly, but usually uninformed. Staff in the PC gaming department could use some polishing on the latest tech and what is available. On the other hand I have had amazing experiences in the TV department. The store has such a wide variety of items that I can usually find what in looking for or find something I didn't intend on getting. Unfortunately, they are usually not the lowest price wise and that gap is not filled by quality of service. This can also be seen by the items they have in stock. For instance I have seen Razer PC gaming gear that isn't even being made anymore, at prices at the same level as the latest and greatest hardware. I have also had negative experiences here with customer management and store organization. I have seen the San Marcos store in complete disarray before. There was a point where I went to buy a new PC gaming chair and test out the various models they have, but every single one was just being lounged in by out of control kids and various people just screwing around in the chairs.

Not a bad place, but definitely doesn't stand out as my one stop shop.</text><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

Fry's is incredible. I've never seen an electronic store with an Atlantis theme, but it was quite the sight. There are giant fish tanks at the entrance. But they also have what you're looking for. They carry an assortment of electronics and components. We came for materials to build a computer and they had what we needed.< /Text>

Do yourself a favor and either set an alarm or have someone that is not too much into technology go with you.  When I go to Fry's electronics I get stuck.  With all the new technology, I just have to know what's next.<//text>

This was the 2nd time I used in store pickup only to leave empty handed. The first time I got the email that said my order was ready but when o got there, an item was missing and this time they tried to give me an illusion box item that wasn't even the same product! At least Best Buy checks the item before sending toy the email<//text>

A sad sight. There is almost nothing left in the store, yet it remains open for some strange reason. It is clearly going out of business; stop prolonging the misery and just close the doors.<//Review>

I ordered something online and got an email that it was ready to pick up. When I went to pick it up it took about 7 minutes to find the item because someone it just left it on a table instead of on the shelves where items are supposed to be left. It took three people to look for it before they finally found the item.

Normally this wouldn't bother me but I had three co-workers waiting in the car for me to head back from lunch.<//Review>

<username>whoda cares<//username><Time>1538038849967</Time><rate>2< /rate><Review>Return policy on many items is totally shady!!  Bought 3 segways 1 didn't work right out of the box and the store wouldn't take back without a struggle... actually thought they would make me return to manufacturers.   Ridiculous... wouldn't refund me! Only a store credit after selling me broken stuff.   This place is truly the worst on customer service.   No one that works there even looks remotely happy.   In fact they look pissed off or dead.   The whole time I was there I was trailed by 5 or 6 security guards after spending over 2000$ there.   I'll never patronize them again!  Worst store ever I'd rather pay more at a better store that put up with this company who just don't care about the customers!  Thinks every customer is a thief... show your receipt at the door while someone pretends to check the items against the receipts.   Just ridiculous!  Apparently they don't know that just about all loss comes from employees not the customers.   Save your time go elsewhere you will thank me!  I actually felt as if they didn't believe me when I said it didn't work out the box.... mind you all I wanted was to exchange for a working one.   I didn't even want a refund!</Review>< pics>

Lots of stuff here, beautiful place to shop.  However, the employees are mostly not very friendly nor are they knowledgeable about their products and whereabouts of the products.  The "cafe" is never opened for business the few times we were there.  But, I do like to shop here because they have lots of stuff.<//review>

Fry's is great about having a broad selection, carrying almost anything you can imagine.  They fall short in accurately labeling products on the shelf, or having well trained & educated sales staff available when you need them. If self service warehouse shopping works for you, you are set. But if you need guidance or have questions about the product,  you are on your own.</Review>

<text>I went to there to buy a karaoke machine. I returned it a week later because it wasn't working properly and I didn't really know what kind of karaoke machine I wanted but I realized that wasn't it.
When I came to return it, such an easy process. It's great to see they wanna make sure what the problem was in the machine, if it's an easy fix instead of having to do a return or store credit, which I ended up doing. Such a easy process on my end and they gave me options on how I'd like my refund.
I got store credit, and now knowing what I was looking for, Ashley was more than helpful. She was the one to help me the first time too. She's very knowledgeable too. I just got the best customer service. All my questions were answered and I went home confident in what I purchased.
Few days later, I definitely made the right choice buying my electronics here.<//text>< pictures>

Not enough employees on the floor. Very long waits to get help with locked away products, even when you know exactly what you need and only need something taken out of a case. Do they not want my money? There is a Best Buy nearby for those situations where you can't wait for an Amazon delivery.</Review>

<Text>Sure Fry's is big and impressive, but jeez... I don't think I'll be going back. Half the time I go there it feels like the employees are treating me like I'm an idiot, once I eventually find somebody to help me (the place feels like a ghost town). The chair I purchased a couple of months ago has some of the weakest stitching. My tv will not connect to my WiFi network, my desk was missing a piece and I had to get it replaced (thankfully they did just give me a replacement part from another box. But only after I had dealt with seemingly clueless employees that wanted me to bring the entire thing back after I had assembled the whole thing... A manager offered me the much more sensible solution of swapping out the missing part though). The USB type c cords I purchased don't even conform to the type c standard, as they are not reversible! They don't work if plugged in in one orientation! And the tv stand I bought has a big scratch in it that I am certain wasn't there when I decided to buy it but was there when it arrived via their delivery service (they did give me a discount as it was a floor model, but I wouldn't have purchased it if the scratch was present then).

The only actually good experience I had was when I was buying some RAM and a water cooling kit. The salesperson helped me get matching RAM based on some pictures, which I did greatly appreciate.

Other than that one salesperson that helped me with my RAM purchase, it seems like none of the employees care in the slightest. :c</Text>< Pictures>

Fry's is my comfort place. Unfortunately, it's just not what it used to be. Promo codes are nice, and internet price matching is awesome, but depending on what you're going for, inventory can be pretty slim. Movies have been reduced to 2 barely stocked aisles when it used to be several that were packed. PC parts and components usually has a good selection, but don't get too excited about general media.< /text>

<Review>I have to admit I like this store better than the one off Aero Drive since they seem to have what I'm looking for in stock. It might be due to the fact that the Aero Drive store is more central, gets more customers, and thus run out of what I'm going to buy at Fry's. Anyhow, this location sells everything a typical Fry's store sells. There are neat aquariums in the store and a nicer food/snack restaurant, as well. Fry's has good prices that are even better with their promo codes that you get via email when you sign up for free on their website.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>Awesome store, I can spend hours just walking through this place drooling over all the cool gadgets. The staff can be hard to find at times and just like best buy they tend to talk like experts on things that they know very little about. Return process isn't quite as simple as best buy, but overall I do love this store. If you are worried at all about the reliability of what you are buying them I go to Best Buy to avoid potential issues of return, but they have a huge variety. It's like radio shack meets best buy on steroids. With the exception of their old school DOS based computer system, and outdated horrible websites lol< /Text><username>Sam rosewall</username></record>

Not to speculate but seem like either Fry's as a company or at least San Marcos store is going out of business. Most shelves were empty, lot's of empty floor space around the store and I also think way less employees in the store than before.</Review>

Always a fun place to go nerd out at. Components, computer parts, tvs, desktops, those little gummy orange wedge candies, audio equipment, refrigerators and more. At times, their prices are a touch high, but being able to pick it up on site is a huge convenience and well worth it.</Text>

<text>Four bad experiences here.

There is rarely a reason to purchase something here. Buy on Amazon or another site that has good customer service and an actual return policy.

Be patient. Wait the one to two days for shipping. Do you really need that item TODAY? Do you need it NOW or can you wait a day for peace of mind?

Prepare to wait around for a long time to not be helped also. Prepare for policies that do not match up with the reciept.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Visited store to look for flatbed scanners. I asked a computer department associate where I could find the flatbed scanners. He looked at me with a glazed over look obviously not knowing what a flatbed scanner was. He pointed to an area across the room towards the printers. Once in the printer area I asked another associate and he also had no clue. I ended up looking myself and eventually found what I needed. Now I remember why I don't shop at Fry's.</text>

<text>Fry's always has what I am looking for. But the workers are another story. The checkout person who checks your recipe. Lazy as worker!!!!!!!. We got a huge tv. Which we needed help with to load in the car. I'm a girl and my husband was with me. You do the math. This kids did nothing to help. Just mumbled took his sweet ass time to get up as if it was such a huge inconvenience for him. Sad world we live in<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Fry's is my comfort place. Unfortunately, it's just not what it used to be. Promo codes are nice, and internet price matching is awesome, but depending on what you're going for, inventory can be pretty slim. Movies have been reduced to 2 barely stocked aisles when it used to be several that were packed. PC parts and components usually has a good selection, but don't get too excited about general media.</review>

<Review>Absolutely beautiful store with gigantic fish tanks and beautiful architectural features looking like a fancy hotel from Vegas. However no one knew where anything was in the store. I was sent from one side of the gigantic store to the other in order to find outdoor speakers. Each department told me it was in another department. Same thing when I tried to find luggage not one person knew where anything was. It wasn't till a nice young Gentleman on his lunch break physically walked me over there. What should have been a 10-minute trip turned into a 45-minute trip.< /Review>< Pictures>

It's an underwater sea of enchantment. I love the decor. I like that they carry almost everything with regards to computer parts and everything else electronic. It's a huge building. I got help immediately and got what I needed and went on my way. I wish they had a store map like Home Depot does so I don't have to wander thru so many aisles just to get to where I need to go. Personally I believe they want us to go thru all the aisles because we would probably grab more great and neat stuff that we dont really need but we have to buy it because it's so cool!< /Text>

<review>Lot's of parking.  You can easily get lost at this store, because it is so big.  The kids love the aquarium theme.  They even have a small restaurant inside.  The staff are friendly and the lines go much faster than other electronics store.  You'll often find hard to find items here for your electronics project.  It is also a great place to just browse the latest technology.</review><pics>None</pics>< gmapID>

<Review>I'm copying this from my Yelp, as it's extensive. Fry's has frustrated me enough, and wasted enough of my time, for me to create and leave a review here:

My experience with the San Marcos store started after black Friday this past year. My husband went to pick up a 60" TV your store had advertised on sale for $500. He went in the morning and bought the TV, to be picked up later that day by both of us, since we lived on the third floor of our apartments at the time. When we returned later that afternoon to pick up our TV, the personnel at the door told us the TV had been paid for and taken, not paid for--to be picked up, like my husband had explicitly requested. They had given him the wrong receipt and while we waited for the management to figure out what they did wrong, we saw his TV in the "waiting to be picked up" portion of the store. With his name on it. The cashier who had made the mistake, never told anyone, so the man who was trying to figure things out looked at us like we were there trying to steal a free TV the entire time, while we were just there trying to pick up our TV and go home.

It took them over an HOUR to rectify this situation, during which we didn't get an explanation, and after which, we didn't even get a simple apology. We wouldn't have even had an explanation if my indignation didn't lead to my requesting to see the manager. The manager helped little, I told him as much, and that his personnel needed training on 1) communication, and 2) customer service. Frustrated, I walked out. When I returned 10 minutes later to pick up the TV with my husband. As we proceeded to walk out the door, after getting our receipt checked by a different person, the original guy runs up behind us and tells us to stop, stop. Now we were being unequivocally treated as thieves, as I can only assume they were discriminating against us because no one else was being treated this way.

I am familiar with discrimination, growing up as a minority. My husband was not, growing up in a heavily Mexican community. This experience deeply hurt him.

After our latest visit to the Fry's store in San Diego (another review), the continual lack of communication, terrible customer service, and training, linked with the discrimination my husband experienced at this store, has cemented that this chain is not worthwhile.< /Review><resp>None<//resp>< user_id>

This place is the worst. The employees are so rude every time I go in. On multiple occasions I have been ignored while two employees finish their personal conversation. If you ask where something is you will get a finger point and an isle number. God forbid someone walk over and actually show you where the item is.< /text>

The manager(s) never seems to be around to report anything.
I ask for help and just get a hold on or they just point in a direction,
and don’t get me started on how loud the music is there it’s deafening!
I feel bad because when I do have a question about anything i corner the guys in there computer repair section ... the IT guys are super sweet and always busy, but they will walk me to the  item I need or at least try and get one of the red shirts to help who will eventually just drop me off and leave me to fend for myself again .</Review>< gmapID>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Four bad experiences here.

There is rarely a reason to purchase something here. Buy on Amazon or another site that has good customer service and an actual return policy.

Be patient. Wait the one to two days for shipping. Do you really need that item TODAY? Do you need it NOW or can you wait a day for peace of mind?

Prepare to wait around for a long time to not be helped also. Prepare for policies that do not match up with the reciept.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9</GmapID></record>

<text>Visited Service dept. and after a week SRO order, corporate called and decided they would not repair/replace laptop screen because new corporate policy disallows ordering parts for laptop/hardware not purchased at Fry's.  I subsequently ordered part and repair services from Amazon for 1/2 the cost quoted at Frys.   I believe Amazon will be putting Frys electronics out-of- business soon.<//text><Rating>1</Rating>< Response>

According to a store associate, "The whole company is restructuring". This translates to bare shelves, nothing restocked, and a completely bare bones store. Save your time and don't visit.< /Text>

Great selection and cool interior. Sometimes a bit hard to find things, the same item or similar item is in many different places. This said, the store has most things imaginable. A cafe in the middle surrounded by salt water fish, didn't try the food, but very cool.<//Review>

<Text>I've been going to Frys for more than a decade.  Love how each is themed differently.  This location in particular has an Atlantis theme (you know, city under water).

It is still one of my favorite electronic stores, but not the same Frys ut used to be.  Back in the day, stuff was cheap and you could get a really good deal.  Especially during Black Friday.  Now not so much.

Nonetheless, it won"t stop me from shopping here.  Still love the size of the store, the selection of merchandise, and its location.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>Massive selection and range of items and thigh others said it was expensive I found very low prices when I took a few moments to search for them, however I alwaysfeel offended when security looks in my bags on the way out the door. If you can't see if someone put something in their bag for the short distance between the cashier and the door then put a camera. I don't care how much you bird-dog me through a camera but to imply you need to check to see if I'm a petty theif on the way out the door though you already saw the receipt that I'm a paying customer is offensive. If someone comes over for a dinner it would be rude to ask to check their coat pockets as they leave my house and customers have shipping bags and receipts and you've got cameras. What costs you more a petty theif ora permanently loss customer who loves electronics and has a steady 6 figure income?< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The only reason why I gave 5 stars is because of Robert in the computer repair department was really busy and ran over to help me find out what memory card that I needed he was outstanding, the reason why I cane to that department was because Cheryl in the computer parts department would not help me if her life depended on it she told me to get lost, was so mad, then after Robert hooked me uo I had to back to the computer parts department and thank god that Ramses was there, he was phenomenal good job guys and if I ran that store Cheryl eould have already got her walking papers, I would fire her right now<//review>

Even though they are commission-based, it is so hard to find any help anywhere in the store. But you can find a bunch of Associates talking to each other. I'd go across the street and had to Best Buy if I was in deep need and couldn't wait to go on Amazon< /Text>

All the reviews are based on bad experiences with very little Value. Items were out of stock!!! WHAT!?! OUT OF STOCK?!?!? I HAVE NEVER!!!

Like come on people, cut some slack. Yes the employee's are "lack luster" at times but you would be to making minimum wage. I have worked retail and upper management are nothing but slave drivers.

Fry's as a store I have nothing bad to say as I am smart enough not to expect the guys in the store to know everything.

If your looking for a good tech store there is none better for mass stock and choice.< /review>

When shopping for electronics the first place that comes to mind (at least for me) is Best Buy, however, their service was not all that great and they didn't have nearly all the printers that Fry's had. The first few employees I encountered (I was asking for guidence to where i could find the printers) were not all that friendly. Once I got the my destination, the gentleman who helped my was very knowledgeable and nice. He helped me find what I was looking for (it felt he had listed to what my printing preferences were and all the small details). I ended up buying from Fry's with no hesitation and the gentleman who helped me even price matched it with Amazon. I would be returning to Fry's again.<//review>

<text>I called the store to see how much longer it was going to take to fix my computer (it’s been there since Thursday) as the tech person said it would take 5 days to fix. I was on hold for 45 minutes! I am never going there to purchase anything again. It is unacceptable to have to have to wait that long when on the call it says 3 minutes to answer the call! I am beyond angry.</text><Rate>1<//Rate><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9</Gmap_id>< Pics>

This has to be the biggest store that I have ever been to. You seriously have to walk around a "wrap around," just to get to the checkout cashier. It's like you're at an amusement park line. It certainly has everything you can imagine in there, relating to electronics and other miscellaneous items of course. I took off a star mainly because the options to accessorize my canon dslr were fairly limited, to say the least; which was my whole reason of entering the store in the first place. I will definitely be back. Cheers!</Text>

<text>Massive selection and range of items and thigh others said it was expensive I found very low prices when I took a few moments to search for them, however I alwaysfeel offended when security looks in my bags on the way out the door. If you can't see if someone put something in their bag for the short distance between the cashier and the door then put a camera. I don't care how much you bird-dog me through a camera but to imply you need to check to see if I'm a petty theif on the way out the door though you already saw the receipt that I'm a paying customer is offensive. If someone comes over for a dinner it would be rude to ask to check their coat pockets as they leave my house and customers have shipping bags and receipts and you've got cameras. What costs you more a petty theif ora permanently loss customer who loves electronics and has a steady 6 figure income?< /text>< Pics>

Stopped in to check the store out. This is a very average Fry's. Aisles were clean and well stocked. The staff came by to ask if I needed help a couple times, and seemed like they were bored. This store had a particularly well stocked selection of unlocked cell phones, but they are all behind glass so you need to request help.< /Text>

Fry's is guilty of false advertising when it comes to "free shipping".
I hate taking the time to research an item only to find out in the middle of the day on the sale (1:30)....Fry's does not keep it's word and as far as I'm concerned guilty of misrepresentation.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

My favorite place on earth. I can spend hours roaming around the store. I am like a kid at Toys RUs. The place is huge and carry almost anything you need. Except for cars or mattresses. Place is not as busy as it used to be. In great part thanks to Ebay and Amazon. Please support your local stores which employ our people.</Review>

<Review>Products and prices are great if you sign up for the email discounts. The service on the other hand is just ok. I find it very difficult at times to get help even on big ticket items and feel like the person actually wants to help. I rate it so high just because of price and availability of product.<//Review>< date>

<review>For the most part it is a nice place sales staff is friendly and eager to help although some lack knowledge of the product they sale which caused me to make a second trip. What I disliked was neinh made to feel like a thief as I left with them asking to see what's in my bag. One would think that a store that sales electronics would have a better method of dealing with product loss takes away from the whole shopping experience</review><Gmap_id>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9< /Gmap_id>< Resp>

Unfortunately, the last two times I have gone to the San Marcos location, the store has been dusty and dirty, the shelves seem largely bare outside of a few sections (they had lots of tv's and cameras), the sales guys huddled together and played games on their phones and were unable to answer my questions. I don't think they were very knowledgeable about their products but seemed to be just slackers looking for a paycheck.

The prices are still fairly competitive, especially considering you don't have to wait for 2-day shipping.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Hands down the most ignorant sales staff I've ever encountered. If you know what you want you can probably find you here relatively inexpensively but don't expect any help , that is if you can find somebody not on their phone and not horsing around , because they will steer you in the wrong direction. My two cents with 30 years in electronics.< /text>< pictures>

Don't know how much longer this place will be around. Not too much stock of items, but they do price match and there are some deals to be found.</text>

Prices are great! Lots of deals going on however customer service it's bad and on top of all they refuse to get defect merchandise back. In addition the rebate stuff its a hassle and many times don't work. I know because happened to me. I want to emphasize that speaks with Manager's there don't make you any good. They never solve an issue in your favor. They look at you just  they could not care less.< /Text>

Wow, after visiting two Fry's today, I'm convinced they are going out of business soon.  Most shelves empty, no computer parts, no computers on display, nothing I was looking for.  They are either investing heavily in online purchases, or they are going out of business.  Don't go to the physical locations unless you are looking for printer cartridges, they had those for some reason, though I don't need them.</Review>

Love this place!!!  I bring my girls here often to see the fish, but also get all my electronics I ever buy here.  I often order on their website and pick up same day in the store.  They match internet pricing so it does not make sense to go anywhere else.< /review>

Great store, but only if you stay away from the Salespeople..  only took 5 of them and 3 trips back and forth across the entire store to find 1 item that was listed on Sale.   2 of them even went to say that they don't even carry it.< /review>

<Text>Today I traveled to Fry's in San Marcos located roughly 40 miles from my house. I spent over an hour and a half in the store picking out parts for a new PC build, having trouble with in stock items and what not, but understandably that is to be expected especially around this time of year.
After sitting in traffic for well over I was excited to put together my Ryzen 5 1600, among other items. The CPU, apparently the only one of its model they had in stock, was an open box item, which is totally fine as long as it is functional and looks good. Upon opening the box at home I noticed that the CPU was definitely used, and although Fry's notate that they inspect the product before re-selling; the product was covered in residue , missing instructions, and most importantly missing thermal paste. At this point I was tempted to just get some thermal paste from my local Best Buy and be done with it, however, I decided to call Fry's and see if they had any more Ryzen 5 1600's in stock. Prior to heading out another 40 miles to the store I was assured by the employee on the phone that my product was in stock.
I arrived at Fry’s 40 minutes before closing and was informed that my CPU was not actually in stock, or at the very least the employees could not locate it. In an attempt to resolve the situation I asked if Fry’s could either ship a CPU to my house so I would not have to travel another 80 mile round trip or compensate me with thermal paste from the store. Both of my suggestions were rudely denied by the supervisor- even more insulting was the fact that they wanted me to pay for additional thermal paste (the thermal paste that should have been included with my product). After discussing the situation with several other employees they tried to explain to me that because I price-matched the CPU with another retailer they couldn't provide me a tube of thermal paste from their shelves, which makes no sense to me at all. It may seem a little ridiculous that I didn't just give up and buy thermal paste myself, however, the principle of the matter was that it was something that was intended to be included with the product I paid for.
Through a lot incompetency and frankly ridiculous policy, Fry’s managed to consume about 6 hours of my day and tried to tell me that If i didn't utilize their price matching policy they would have conceded. So, for the price of a $3 tube of thermal paste Fry’s lost a long time customer and seeing all the other recent reviews I am assuming that I am not the only one.</Text></record></dataset><record>

From phones to tablets, microwaves to lazy boys, along with every electronic doohickey and thingamajig you can imagine. I have to set aside entire weekends when I even think about waking in, cuz I can spend that long just finding things I never seen or heard of nor do I probably need these things, but I want them, oh how i do.
Oh yeah, pretty good prices and stuff too< /review>

You can never really go wrong with Fry's. They stock everything from surface mount components to big screen TVs and everything in between. It can be a bit difficult to find a sales person at times but that does not take away from they fantastic selections and great prices.</text>

<Text>The fish tanks are worth a visit by themselves. But the real reason to go to Fry's is that they have a huge stock of great stuff with a price match guarantee. So figure out what you want by searching online, then pick it up at Fry's for the best price. No waiting on delivery.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I wanted to mention the outstanding customer service I received from a young man named Calvin in the tech department. He went above and beyond to explain to me my options with patience and used terms I could easily understanding. The management was cooperative and I am pleased with the results for my situation. However, if it were not for the assistance of Calvin, I think Fry's would NOT be my choice for electronics.< /Text>

<review>Great prices, but not better than Amazon and I'm pretty sure they don't know what customer service is. I've been shopping at Fry's for years, but unfortunately due to the last few times that I experienced their lack of customer service, I'm never going back.<//review>< Pictures>

The only tech store should use Android pay/apple pay. That said, they do have most of the emergency stuff. Even found a PS/2 keyboard for a console session I needed dearly. If you need it today, they have it. If it can wait, you can get it cheaper online.< /review>

Brought them to the front to check out and they rang up as $19.99! The cashier goes back with me to check and their where sever still on the peg. Looking around their is no peg for the $19.99 and she tells me that their their by mistake. So I grab an other type also on a peg for 3.99 and we head back to checkout. This set ring up at $9.99! Back to the see what else they have this time with a manager. Check several items that are not on the correct peg, the manager apologizes that so many are wrongly stocked.

I did my best to support the physical store but without knowing the price so that I can compare prices even on what they have in stock how can that work. I will be buying them on line at least I can compare prices.</text>

Not bad but most of the kids selling have NO knowledge of anything. Most of them look just out of HS. They don't carry many Dell Laptops anymore, so that was disappointing.<//Text>

< Review>
I spent 600 on electric scooters that definitely did not perform as advertised , I tried to bring them back and buy the 200.00 more expensive Segway versions and was told there was nothing they could do for me... really? So you sell me an inferior product, I try to come back and make your mistake of selling junk better by giving you more money and I get told take a hike?!? Give me a break! I’ve spent thousands here and will never spend another dime! While I was at the desk I was harassed by a customer that was in line and didn’t want to wait his turn and employees egged him on!! Seriously the worst customer service I’ve ever had!< /Review>

Shop with caution, It's like a Vegas casino in that there are no windows to the outside so you can easily lose track of the time while in there looking at all the goodies.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><name>Chris Haworth</name>< Time>

As time has gone on, Fry's customer service and knowledge of their employees has lowered significantly since the early 2000's. The last 3 times I have ordered something online, and headed to the store AFTER receiving the confirmation email that my order was ready (an additional 45 minute trip) they could not find my order, or verify it had been pulled from the shelf. So if you know what you need, and are good with self service, head on down to this Fry's!< /Review>

It's a shadow of the former glory that stores like this used to be--thanks internet.  The staff seems a little sad and tends toward the "not knowledgeable" end of the IT spectrum.  But they do have a lot of hard to find equipment and the grapeful dead smoothie in the coffee shop is delicious.<//Text>

My collage student daughter buy a refurbished HP computer $600 and was talked into the $200 warranty!  Come to find out this computer has a known issue with the screw in the hinge coming out.  The issue is all over online. I called Fry's headquarters in Arizona and was told it was covered call San Marcos CA to tell them what I was told still they did not fix it!  Do not purchase refurbished computers from Fry's! Bits a rip off!<//Review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Text>Saturday the day AFTER Black Friday I went to Fry's. A man in the check out line was commenting tohis wife as we walked by that 2 1/2 hours in line was crazy and they still had 15-20 people ahead of them. As I turned to walk out I noticed that many of the cash registers had no one there. Frys is set up so there are cash registers on both sides of an island like area yet that whole extra side was stacked with open boxes and appeared to be used for storage in addition to only about 1/2 the registers being used on the normal check out side. Why design a store to accommodate extra check outs in times expected heavy business when they don't use them?< /Text>< Pics>

Their selection is a choice between low end and low end with a big price.  They have become too comfortable to be competitive or innovative in their products. I can get all the same stuff from amazon without the lines or messy aisles.< /Text>

Pretty reliable location.  Don't have as many issues with this location confirming pickups but not actually pulling the product as some other locations.  Would be great if they had content playing in the rear theater more.</Text>

Service here can be a little spotty. Once you find someone to help you, you're likely to get a really good price on what you're looking for, but watch out because, mixed in with a good prices, are lots of items with a hefty price tag. Join their internet ad program for even greater savings on their advertised items where you can really avoid the usual high retail prices charged by others.< /Text>

The only tech store should use Android pay/apple pay. That said, they do have most of the emergency stuff. Even found a PS/2 keyboard for a console session I needed dearly. If you need it today, they have it. If it can wait, you can get it cheaper online.<//Review>

This Fry's Electronics is probably the largest I have seen. There is plenty of selection, and the signs point you to the deals. You can find deals online, but the salesmen here are very helpful if you want to talk to someone.</text>

<text>Not very well organized or well stocked. I came in to get 2 of an item that they showed as in stock online. Someone helped me find it, then I looked in the packages since both were opened to make sure all the pieces were there, and one was missing an important component. I asked the same guy if they have any other similar products and he couldn't answer. He also just left the package on the shelf despite it missing half of it, and being unusable. I also told 2 other people, the cashier and the guy she had go do the pricecheck because it rang up wrong. I had to walk him to the area for the item(as he had no clue what is was or where it was from) , and he took the tag off the shelf for the cashier, but left the incomplete one on the shelf.<//text>< Response>

This store is so noisy because of its piped-in music I've literally left baskets full of things and walked out the door- on multiple occasions. Has never helped to complain. Love their pricing and their promo codes but it's really hard to find things in the store, even for their own staff.< /text>

<Review>More employees than customers. The place feels deserted and the items they stock are a mix of eclectic electronic components, computers, TV, karaoke machines, laser discs, stuffed animals, drones. Probably the biggest collection of electronics under one roof. Problem is the employees seem to know they are on the verge of being layed off and they act like it. You find them in packs talking to each other, or heading to a break but they are not very interested in the occasional customer that wonders in. It's like they know you will browse and order from Amazon anyway.<//Review>< Pictures>

It seems like this electronic retail giant's glory days have been gone long time ago; they simply just cannot compete with Amazon and eBay in terms of pricing and selections.  However, you still can find some interesting stuffs in person as a fun part of "Shopping in Reality".<//review>

You walk through two huge oblisks when walking into it and it almost has a lost city of Atlantis vibe. It can be busy becuase its the only one in the area. Yes, there is a cafe in this one 👍.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Stoped by to buy a computer. Salesmen said he'd print out a list of ones that fit our requirements. 6 minutes later found him chatting with a off duty coworkers. No list, we left and went to Best Buy.
The salesman there took the time to give us a full education on all the new technology that's out now. I think we made a great decission.</review>

Horrible Fry's. I called to place a laptop on hold and the sales person told me that I had to put my credit card down, he said it would not be charged. I asked him if he is sure that my card would not be charged and he promised me 100% sure that it would not be charged. I gave my credit card information and he had trouble entering it and wanted me to give him the info again but I told him never mind. After hanging up I get an e-mail with an order confirmation. I check my credit card and it was charged. I called back to resolve the issue and the manager was rude and unwilling to help. He did cancel the order but it took me almost 2 weeks to finally get my money back. I had to call 5 times and talk to the manager trying to get my money back. It was an ordeal. Never again will I buy from this Fry's.<//text>

Good selection of electronics, dish washers and fridges. TVs cameras and more. Massive selection of computer, USB, firewire cables. Large music and video selection. Prices are a bit more than at large box retail stores, BUT staff much more, knowledgeable, on site upgrade installation.</text>

<text>One of favorite Fry's theme store.  This store has an Atlantis underwater theme with 2 giant Jacobs Ladders guarding the front doors.  All of the items are strategically placed together in the store, so that you do not have to travel a mile around the store (I measured this) to find everything that you're looking for including checking out.

The Pricing is also at the top of the list on affordability and the quality exceeds the price in most cases.</text>< pics>

Some helpful employees and all the Fry's stuff you expect to see. Thank goodness the poor fish/shark they used to confine in a small tank to be tortured is no longer there. I sure hope it didn't die but was moved somewhere else. I regret not calling attention to it to animal rights groups.</Text>

Really strange store. It looks like it was originally in a cinema and they haven't removed any of the Atlantis themed things. Selection is good and lots of hands-on displays. It was difficult to find any staff members here.<//Text>

These guys have everything when it comes to electronics. Not to mention other things like a bistro, paintball guns, hoverboards, furniture, books, and more food. It's a huge store that's fun to just walk around in even if you don't feel like buying anything. So big though that sometimes it's hard to find help.<//review>

Came all the way from San Diego just to buy a monitor that was clearly stated in the website as brand new. Upon arrival found out that it was a open box one.

Gave it 2 stars because the staff was very nice and helpful.< /Text>

<text>Bought a previously returned google Chromecast on 12-19 for a slightly reduced price. We were planning to disconnect AT&T U-Verse and switch to YouTube TV, with an older TV, we would need the Chromecast for it. We delayed disconnecting U-Verse and I opened the box a couple weeks later and discovered that the device wasn’t in the box. The holidays were hectic and we went away on vacation. We finally disconnected U-verse on 1-2-19 while away and returned on 1-9. Went to Frye’s on 1-14 to return or even exchange the item. The customer service rep called the manager to explain the situation and the response was that basically they don’t believe me because I didn’t return it sooner, even though the return was within 30 days. The box had the power supply in it. Unbelievable. This tells me that they failed to verify the contents of the box when the Chromecast was returned by the initial purchaser and then they tell a customer who would even be willing to exchange the device for the same item, that they don’t find me credible. I still need the Chromecast with more urgency now that U-verse is disconnected at home but refuse to take my business ever again to Frye’s. I’m heading to Best Buy. This experience was offensive and insulting and only a second-rate retailer would repackage a return without the actual device in it. Thank god for competition and I’m certain my experience is not an anomaly.<//text>< userid>

<Review>Fry's is one of my favorite places to "nerd out". The place is huge and even has a cafe inside if you need to rest. Shop with caution, It's like a Vegas casino in that there are no windows to the outside so you can easily lose track of the time while in there looking at all the goodies.< /Review>< Pics>

Huge store. They have it all. Customer service is spotty at times. They claim to match internet pricing by competition. I have tried twice and each time they have an excuse like, that's not a reputable vendor or someother lousy excuse. Return poilcy is pretty easy. Plenty of good parking as a side note.<//Text>

I can't believe the audacity to make up as many excuses to not honor price matching.

Basically when they're at the computers they aren't trying to "price match" they're trying find a reason on the website/competitor page to not give you 100% price match. So not only is it insulting to your intelligence but also a giant waste of time.

If you want a better place to price match, Office Depot of (all places) was very very awesome.<//text>

Actually never been. Tried to. Called them to ask ONE question set my phone on speaker, actually forgot about it and picked up my phone....never answered after 27 min. That is a reflection of management. And un-motivated employees. Mac desktop and laptop will look elsewhere to purchase.< /Text>

<text>This place is where engineer-nerd types go when they die.  At least that is what this engineer-nerd type thinks.  This place carries everything a. developer would need to design anything they might think up and more.  Just the other day I think I came across a late model flux capacitor that still had a couple of centuries left on it for less than a thousand bucks!  Imagine that.

The only time I couldn't find something was when I needed inductors for a crossover that goes inside a speaker. Barring something highly specific like that you can find everything from video cards to resistors and various adapters. This particular location is huge with plenty of parking and usually enough open registers that you don't have to wait in line.<//Text>< Pictures>

I recently visited the frys in san Marco's calif with a computer problem. The techs name was Jeff and he was beyond all expectations. He fixed my granddaughters computer and was extremely helpful. I will continue to use frys for all my computer and electronic needs as his customer service was above and beyond expectations. Great job frys, keep hiring people like this and I'll buy a car from you<//text>

Update, one year later, dropping off yet another star: Don't bother finding anything that is in the sale ad. IF they had any it was few. They are stripping down shelving, thinning out the stock. Obviously going downhill and going by the way of Radio Shack. Soon, there will be almost NO place to walk in and buy the electronic parts I need. A simple USB cable is too much to expect from an electronics store? They had cables in no less than 5 different locations in the store and not the one I needed. It's almost to the point that they need to yank off that bandaid and put itself out of it's misery.
------------------------------------------------------

Original review:
Went to find a sale item. The thing was not on the shelf and I could find no slot where it might go. The worst part is not finding ANY employees in the area to help. I left the store with the security check person yakking away with some other slacker. All I got was Have A Nice Day. An hour of time wasted.

This scenario is very typical of most of my visits. Can't find products, can't find help. Sale items are scattered around the store in illogical locations to force you to run marathons. I don't have time for their games. Makes a person lean more to online shopping.

The San Marcos store is clean, spacious, brightly lit and fun to browse in.< /Text>

The service when you are looking for a product is fine. After that, it sucks. I bought a computer and there should have been 0% intrest on the card. They ended up charging me interest for the first year. When I went to dispute it they had me wait for over a hour the 3 times I went in. Just to tell me at the end to call their bank. When I would the bank would tell me to go in store. They kicked me back and forth between the two of them. Terrible service.</Review>

<Text>In the past we always had trouble finding someone to help and answer question but on our last trip to Fry's we found a good help in two different departments to advise us.
Don't like Fry's customer service, one time I returned a broken item because it was broken when I bought it and the person at the return counter just packaged it up again and marked it for sale as "open box". That means they will sell it to another customer that then has the same hassle to bring it back as I did.</Text>< Pics>

What a joke... 17 employees working on a project on one isle of the store and nobody to help me in software. I wait 15 mins or so then asked for help. They said we will send somebody right over...15 more mins nobody came to help so I left.< /review>

This store is so noisy because of its piped-in music I've literally left baskets full of things and walked out the door- on multiple occasions. Has never helped to complain. Love their pricing and their promo codes but it's really hard to find things in the store, even for their own staff.< /Text>

Good prices and they match internet. I normally carry my phone and search for the item and see if I can get it cheaper. They are always nice about it, but most of the time they have the best price.<//Review>

Been here several times to get things not in stock at my local Fry's. Remember to check stock online before going. The San Marcos store is a very nice looking store with huge aquariums of fish to look at. Which is probably good if you have younger kids that are going with you that need to be entertained. It also probably influenced my experience otherwise would probably be 3 stars. I went for a tiger rice cooker and they did have it in stock. The one and only open box, but I bought it because everything was there and it was unused. I looked around at other small appliances on the aisle and saw generati that we're opened too. Seems to be common problem at Fry's stores because the San Diego store on Stonecrest looks the same. Anyways got what I came for and the only complaint is regarding cashier and cashier supervisor. I tried to pay using Samsung Pay with my debit card to add a few more points to Samsung account. Cashier says I don't think we accept Samsung Pay. I said that I've used it there before and tried to scan. She says it won't work because I didn't push the button. She yells for supervisor who is busy and tells her to wait. She then tries to call someone to ask but they don't answer. I said I'll just try and see if it works. She said we can't do that. Then supervisor yells what do you need to her. She asks the question and supervisor says, no won't work he needs to sign for it. All the while I'm trying to use debit and enter my pin. "Always works" no chip needed. So I had to get my wallet out and use my card. :(
I know pretty petty complaint, but it just confirms why Ama**n continues to gain use over going into a store. With Ai I would have tried to use a type of payment and it works or doesn't and we move on to trying something else. Guess I'll probably give this more thought and edit review later, not sure why it bothered me as much as it did.<//Text>

Absolutely the worst experience ever. It literally took 30 minutes to check out and then I had to go back in to return something and it took about 20 almost 25 minutes because the person's computer or whatever froze and now I still have to wait 2 to 5 days for the refund to hit my credit card. I will never ever visit any one of their stores again.</text>

This is the place to go if your primary interest is being left alone to fend for yourself. Bad service is the norm here, in my experience. I only shop here when they are the only local source of products because the service is so consistently mediocre.<//Text>

<Review>Unless you're in there all the time, it can be tough to find stuff (we found porn easier than micro sd cards). But always well stocked, and honestly, you could hide in a back corner and live off the food, sleeping bags, electronics, makeup... Its like Wal-Mart with magic the gathering.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Gigantic store with almost everything you could need, except rechargeable batteries. Price matching is great as long as the item is shipped and sold by the same seller.< /review>

Just spent 45 mins in this store trying to get a new hard drive and a copy of windows. Found the hard drive easy enough, but after asking 3 different people where I could find the windows install disks and drives and getting 3 different answers and going to the place they pointed to only to find nothing close to what I was asking for I gave up and decided to just get the hard drive. Got to the front of the store to pay, and it rang up as almost double what it was labeled on the floor. The sales clerk said the price on the floor required a promo code and a signup for their website. Walked out. Frustrated and wasted my entire lunch break on something that should have taken 10 mins.< /review>

Not the type to complain but asked if they had smartwatches. They said yes in the phone department thats it. Walked around looking for the section okay over it hardly any selection unless I missed something.

Picked up some bose headphones went to pay. One cashier and around 10 plus employees behind counter. Waited a good while since the customer ahead had an issue. Waited not even a we will be right with you all kept counting the drawer and others just standing. Finally placed headphones on counter and left. Nothing was said on either end.<//Text>

I purchased a TV on 10/08/18, went home, opened it, plugged it in and it was defective. On the VERY next day 10/09/18, I brought it back in the box with receipt. I DID NOT damage it or even use the TV.  I brought it back to the San Marcos store location and I was treated as if I caused this!!!
I was told I had to file a claim with the manufacturer and was sent home with the broken TV and out almost $1000!  I spoke with two managers and several employees and none were able to do anything!

This is theft! They take money, give faulty product, and turn their back. My relationship is with the store NOT the manufacturer! I haven't even tried the product yet. They sold me a defective unit!

I cannot stand by this policy. It's not the same as the delivery of a vehicle or purchase of a home. There wasn't a delivery check sheet, there wasn't a walk through...their process doesn't support their policy ie signed document saying product received in perfect condition!!

THIS IS FRAUD!!!</Text>

This store uses bait and switch tactics all the time with their promo codes and price matching system! I have put 2 items on hold in the last 2 months and BOTH have gotten lost in their system! And when I went to get them, they did not fulfill the price I reserved them for! They use their own amazon database to price your items that is not accurate and I have on multiple occasions, given them UPCs to amazon items that they cannot pull up on their own system! They are disrespectful and treat customers arrogantly, assuming they do not know anything about computers. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.<//Review>

<review>I hate this place. I've come here many time with my family and not once have I found what I was looking for nor did I feel that the employees knew what I was talking about.

Selection can be good. Prices on sale items affordable but the constant following customers, badly pretending to not be following or watching, the cashiers tripping over themselves in an effort to get you out faster and the fake goodbye and hope to see you again soon said with a sneer is just not worth it. They actually congratulate themselves on a made up fantasy robbery that alienates customers and wards of business. I went to DMV at 6 am and they opened at 8 am in san Marcos and by 9 am I was out and thought I had enough anger and stupidly thrown at me for a year, but F actually made me feel that DMV had been the better bad part of the morning!!!< /Review>

I see a lot of negative reviews here so I though I would write something a little more positive.  I have purchased 3 computers at Fry's over the years and have never had a problem.  The last computer was a Lenovo Z710 with 1TB hard drive and 16GB memory which listed for $1599 I found a bargain online for $999.00 and went to Fry's to see if they had it and would match the price.  The had it and they had it on sale for $1350., however they matched the price even though I felt they would rather not.  No hassles.  I have purchased many items from them including a 55" Sony TV which was a current model that I bought for 1/2 the list price on sale.   I have never had a defective product.  I did return an item than I bought by mistake and returned it without any hassle.  I shop at the store in San Marcos, find it clean and well stocked.  Maybe I'm lucky, which I'm not, but find Fry's to be a great place to buy electronics.<//Review>

<text>Employees are more knowledgeable than Best buy. Products are not as high quality as products you get on Amazon, and are usually more expensive. Don't count on price matching. They will search for the website you show them, then say they can't find it, or it isn't the same thing, when it is. I would recommend Amazon. Better prices and better quality.</text><Rating>3</Rating>< user_id>

Horrible customer service!!! My xbox one s is having intermittent problems with video... makes gaming hard.  I bought a $70 2 year warranty from them when I bought the xbox, called in to verify it was valid then drove 40 min to get to the store, but they wouldn't exchange it because after 30 minutes of resetting and restarting the xbox, they got it to work... THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT!! Worst customer service I have had in a very long time.< /Review>

It's ok. Huge store with an ok selection. If you see it online, that does not mean they have it. All three products I found online, were not in store. The staff stinks. Prepare to wander around a HUGE store looking. No one was in line but it took forever. Seriously,  forever. They did have a cool fish tank. This is an only if I have to store. I wish I could be positive about my Fry's visit, but why, it is what it is. Good luck.< /text>

Great selection of electronics. This store is huge. There is an awkward cafe in the middle of the store. The space is massive and whatever you are looking for you will find it. Plenty of computers and computer accessories, TVs, appliances. The store itself is a little quirky, makes the place worth visiting just to see what it looks like. There are strange underwater type of decorations in the front of the store, as if this store once was something completely different and then transformed into a frys. Unless all frys look like that, I wouldn't know this is the only one I've been to.</Review>

Good prices, hard to get straight answer on laptop comparisons.  Definately motivated salespeople pl le.  Big place, clean, but not always easy to find small items.  Definately good for sales and bulk buy.< /Text>

Claim they match online prices and that they "won't be beat"  but every site with the lowest price gets you a "sorry we don't price match with them" or "sorry only local stores". Micro Center isn't too far away from here to just drive there and get much better deals. That's what I'll do from now on. I only have 2 stars instead of one because they atleast had what I wanted.</review>

<Review>They have pretty much everything here, especially hard to find small electronic parts.  They have an extensive selection of small transistors. Anything you need as far as computers go.  Return policy can be a bit restrictive so care is warranted in that area.</Review>< response>

<text>This store is well worth the rage inducing trip down the 15S, from Craig rd to the ***far*** south end of the strip. Amazing prices, staff who have ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE about the products (unlike a certain store with employees in blue shirts) and the giant fish tank makes my heart happy.< /text>< pictures>

<review>There inventory and what they actually have don't match. Customer Service wasn't very helpful. Also when asked to call another store to assure that the phone is there an employee laughs and comments on how they won't answer the phone just like them. I don't understand how they can't pick up a phone call when many employees are just standing around doing nothing.</review>< Pics>

<Review>I've been in the San Marcos CA Frys location a couple times and my experience has been mixed between just ok and not so good. The staff is helpful and asks how they can help. The store is huge but, bigger isn't always better and it feels like they have more shelf space then products. As far this location, it is in dire need of a remodel or update at the least.< /Review>< Resp>

There was no merchandise. The shelves were almost completely empty. I purchased a screen protector for my S8 Note and it was not even close to the right size; for a totally different phone. It said Samsung S8 Note on the front of the box!< /Text>

We went in tonight, 08/01 looking for a program for our desktop computer. It took us several minutes to find anyone working there and when we did ask a young associate, walking around with what seemed to be his buddies, we asked if he was busy. His reply: "a little bit!!" and continued on with the other 3 young men he was walking with.
When we asked another associate where the program we were looking for was, he just pointed in the general direction.
We looked and searched until i literally yelled out to a guy for help. He came over and heeled alot, but out was slit of trouble getting help.
Wish i could say i wouldn't return again, but it's one of a few electronics stores around.<//review>

<Review>This place is huge, well decorated inside (underwater theme with beautiful fish tanks) and has all the home electronics you could want, plus a bunch of other eclectic items. The staff is typically meh, but have been getting better over the last year or so.
Their pricing is weird, some things have really good prices, but most are a bit high, so you really need to double-check before you buy there.
Last, I HATE the 1000 foot maze they make you walk through to get to a register. Several years ago, they needed that line space, but in the last few years (even during the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas or other big sales holidays) there have only been a few people in line in front of me. They recently took out half of the 50+ registers to make more counter room. I am guessing that they will be going out of business in the next year or so at this rate.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Terrible customer service!!!!!! I walked in and immediately asked an associate where to do a return, she directed me to the checkout line. After getting in line, luck would have it that the same associate I originally asked where to go to do my return ended up being my cashier. I handed her my receipt and the item I wished to return and she then stated I have to go another area for returns and the reason I didn’t know that is because the original entrance is closed. I just looked at her and left to stand in another line for 10more minutes. This is one of the reasons I will never purchase from Fryz again.< /Text>< gmapID>

<Time>1379701579287<//Time><Review>While Fry's boasts great prices, its selection and customer service are mediocre at best. Internet price matching is great, but finding what you want in stock and getting a person who knows what they're talking about is a chore. My suggestion? Educate yourself in advance, know what you're going for, approach a podium and (possibly wait a few minutes to) ask if they have it in stock.<//Review>< user_name>

Horrible employees and management. Customers feel like they are in a car dealership. One of the worst services I had received on a color printer for years. They sold me an open box printer saying all is fine with it. When I tried to return it they charged me for missing parts! And the sales person denied even mentioning to me that this was an open box item.

When i showed them the picture i took of the printer while i was in the store they still refused. Will never step into this store again.</text>

Guys in the car electronics department were helpful and found what I was looking for. When checking out and trying to get them to Internet price match, as the sign outside says they do, the cashier disappeared for twenty minutes and then used every excuse not to match the price when she finally returned. Needless to say I did not purchase from Fry's. Items are ordered and expected within two days from Amazon for a savings of over 50%.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Fry's  has no customer service and does not support the product they sell. I waited on hold for an hour to see if I could exchange or get a refund on a malfunctioning car stereo I purchased from them. Their customer service would not give me a straight answer on returning the defective unit, they just kept trying to pass me off to another department. I will never stop at Frys again they are worthless.</Text>

Great deals, and they are willing to match Amazon when their deals aren't better. As far as retail stores go, Frys is absolutely awesome. I'm really glad they are still in business (and the store is HUGE.) They've got everything just about!<//Text>

<time>1555275636389< /time><rate>1< /rate><text>Edit: came back after two years, customer service is important when working in electronics. Manufacturing defects do happen on occasion. My folks bought parts for my little brother to build a computer, and I came down to assemble it. Gigabyte board had a bent pin. Decided to simply get an exchange for the same model as we were still within the 30 day window.

Fry's refused to exchange or refund the motherboard. Their policy is that damaged products cannot be returned, even if sold in a damaged state. Caviat Emptor, if you buy from here, check your components before purchasing.<//text>< pics>

<review>People go to Fry's for the deals they have. Customer service and returns can be a challenge.  This is why some say Frys stands for forever returning your stuff.  This location has an aquatic theme​ which is interesting.< /review>< pictures>

Of the two Frys in San Diego county, this is the nice one.  This one was originally built as a Frys whereas the one in Mission Valley was converted.   As such, the decor in the San Marco's has a theme (Atlantis).

It makes a difference since there is a happier feeling here and the fish tanks are incredible, so your kids will love it.

Frys is the best place to go to look at and touch real goods rather than the internet and they will match any price you pull up on your phone.  The 32" monitor here cost almost $100 less than Amazon and cheaper than anywhere else I could pull up.  So they were already the lowest price.  Give them a try.< /Review>

i am sorry about the two star; (being very considerate) but the customer service is terrible. also, it was my birthday when i went in there and they didn't let me bring my water bottle in!!! ridiculous, right? also, i was shopping for a MacBook and the person i was working with left us so he could find a price match for me but then twenty minutes later, he didn't come back again. went to Best Buy, talked for ten minutes, bought the macbook in five. when i left best buy, guess who i saw? the person who left us at Fry's!!!< /Review>

It is a big store and they have anything you need, however is very hard to find someone to help you.  The extended warranties on kitchen appliances is waste of my money.  They have contract with cheap local repair shops owned by unqualified individuals and they perform trouble job during the repair.< /review>

The '5 Star' be only for 'Crystal', aka 'store manager.' [the only communication I made there].
(a) Beginning with her COMMUNICATION. (b)  Followed in how she handled the return/refund transaction: (a) overall, (b) in comparison to the S.D. Stonecrest store.
As I told Crystal, she knows how to gain a customer, as Bryan (manager of the other store) knows how to lose one.<//text>

Bought item, had to return. Exchanged for correct item but was higher priced. Expected considering only one in stock as display. Make certain emphasis on item wanted.< /Text>

<Text>No customer wifi was really annoying.  Some reasons there is a network void there on ATT and I had to step outside to do any price searching etc.  I went in to get a Switch for my nephew but wanted to check prices etc.  Decided to just buy the Cat 6 cables I came in for and headed to Gamestop for the system instead.< /Text>< pictures>

Went shopping for a TV last night. Was walking around the TV's for about 30 minutes, there were 3 associates standing around talking using profanity. They all saw us and not one of them said hello or offered any kind of assistance. Finally after being there for 45 minutes we approached one of them with questions. Suddenly 2 of them helped us, however one of them was eating candy or nuts.</review>

Cool kitchen appliances.  They sell mattresses, kids toys, and as seen on tv products. It's very organized and clean. The repair guys are somewhat helpful but the store doesn't always have the necessary parts. They even have a cafe inside (expensive). Love the ocean themed deco throughout entire store. Prices are decent. Definitely more expensive than walmart but cheaper than Best Buy.</Text>< Pics>

I bought 3 laptops (not all mine) here, one a acer the other two the same. The acer witch was brand new has broken way more than the rest and Tech Support has failed to fix the issue. The other two have also broken down and after getting fixed. The first few times I thought it was user errror so I was more cautious. Yet, they still broke down. I am here again for the third time and this place is NOT CONVIENT TO GET TO. I am more than frustrated with there employees and the work they have done on the laptops.
This Paticular time I have all three laptops here to be fixed and they proceeded to tell me we cant get a loaner same day. As all three computers in the house have broken at least once we need a loaner. I have also gotten a loaner same day before so what is so different about this time? I am very sure I don't know everything about technology but save yourself the time and buy your electronics SOMEWHERE ELSE.</Review>

<Text>Worst return department on earth. The computer system that runs this joke of a store is straight out of the 80's, green screen and all. It literally takes 6 minutes to process a return and this is after it takes them 8 minutes to question you and wander around in the back talking to whomever about the return? Zero customer support and complete imbeciles working the return desks. Better off buying anything similar from Costco even if the price is higher because you know without a doubt you can return it without any hassles. These hourly wage earners make you feel like a criminal for returning anything, even with the receipt.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>We bought high priced items, and asked for them to be brought to the front while we shopped, but they had us waiting for an hour to bring us our items once we had gotten done paying for our items, and they forgot to bring 2 of our 5 items entirely! How can you have someone checking items out, but not make sure that your items are properly given to you as you leave?! We spent too much money to have to drive back, and grab these items after we paid for them. We essentially have bought these items twice now, in gas and having to deal with the stress of moving into our new home, and get home to find that these items are missing! We have a new baby, so this was pretty stressful to have to go the first time, so to have to turn around and grab these things is ridiculous!!!<//Review>< gmap_id>

This Paticular time I have all three laptops here to be fixed and they proceeded to tell me we cant get a loaner same day. As all three computers in the house have broken at least once we need a loaner. I have also gotten a loaner same day before so what is so different about this time? I am very sure I don't know everything about technology but save yourself the time and buy your electronics SOMEWHERE ELSE.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

The store manager refused to do a price match on a dji Mavic air directly from the dji's website which follows all their official price match policies listed on their website.

The sales accociates (3) were unfamiliar the products and spend more time joking with their collegues than helping costomers.

The store could use a little merchandising

But other than that. Good store. Big product selection.< /Review>

Bought computer, HP, and 40 days later, audio wouldn't work.   Got replacement but same problem.  Returned and got a Lenovo.  After 30-day return policy, Frys prorated my 3-year warranty and I lost $40 for no other reason than it was after the 30-day return policy even though it was a bad computer.  I waited too long to start using my computer due to other impending issues.  Never wait, you'll lose money.< /Text>

I'd go with 4 or 5 stars for them based on the fact that they have every single thing I need for consumer electronics bits and pieces. I genuinely enjoy the enormous selection of everything I like. I have to cut it back to 3 stars because of a combination of the staff and the processes. It's nearly impossible sometimes to track down anybody in any department except the computer section where they have far too many sales folks with not near enough to do it seems. They don't bother you as much as they used to while you were shopping so I guess that's improved but there are a whole heck of a lot of them.
Procedurally stand in the checkout line for far too long, get charged the incorrect amount for something, tell the cashier on the spot but they can't void the sale, we have to to to returns to get it refunded. This doesn't happen all the time but enough to be irritating.<//review>

Awful returns or customer service. Came in to spend several hundred dollars on new printers and couldn't get a $6 refund on still-in-the-package cables with a receipt because it was past 30 days since the purchase. That was because the last time I came in to return the cables, I waited in line for almost an hour and the line hadn't moved. Frys, you just lost my business for good.< /review>

After a reciever failed and I took it in to service under their in store extended warranty, it took almost 3 hours to check it in and secure a loaner.  Nobody knew what was going on and the only person who knew how to do a loaner wasn't there.  I just picked up the reciever after 2 months and all the screws in the back were missing, and the volume knob has physical damage.  The associate gave me some screws and a screw driver and we put some spare screws we found in a spare screws bin back in.  He apologized for the damage.  That's just the beginning.  It took 45 minutes for them to figure out how to get the loaner returned and get me the damaged goods back to me.  I get it home and hook it all back up and turn it on, now it says version error.  To sum up my experience: I used to love going to Fry's, now I cringe at the thought of stepping foot in this place.  My wife refuses to return.<//review>

Store is a total mess and when I tried to return something well with the restrictions and policy the GM told me I could only get a store credit at best because he couldn't get the return to enter into the computer. Funny that a computer store's GM can be defeated by a computer. What a joke.<//Review>

<Review>It's like a pilgrimage to the holy land for me. As a tech junky, they have almost everything I need and their prices are usually good.

Their return policies have always seemed fair, too.

Only bummer is that their associates must be on commission because they're always hounding me to let them enter things into the computer on the sales floor as their sale, even if I found the item on the shelf without assistance. Actually, I wouldn't mind that if it wasn't so time consuming.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

I buy movies, ink cartridges, video games, ect... I'm a delivery driver in use of a car charger to charger my phone as I work (GPS use) and I bought one at Fry's which only lasted a day until it malfunctioned. I was not allowed to exchange it since it was not in it's original package (probably in a garbage truck by now); this is disappointing and will switch over my electronic needs to Best Buy.<//review>

I was born and raised in San Diego and have been going to this Fry's as long as I can remember. I have had NO trouble, customer service is friendly and helpful. Huge store but also very organized I know right where to go as soon as I walk in. They have honored all 5 of my returns without a hassle. This is by far my favorite store my only complaint is sometimes all the employees are busy with other customers, which is understandable though. Anyone giving this fry's under 4 stars are surely mentally unstable and should not be trusted! There is also a very cool fish tank with a shark and a few jacob's ladder's.<//review>

Reg: 14 Gonzales, Mariel C.

I wanted to let you know that I received great service with a smile form your cashier Mariel Gonzales. She was very courteous and professional. I just wanted you to know that. She will be a great asset to your company. I have my own business, Ariel's furniture Refinishing and Upholstery and I know that good employees are VERY VERY VERY hard to come across.

I hadn't been to your store in a few years and was happy to find everything I was looking for.

I bought a Lenovo Tablet and I am very happy with it.<//text>

<Text>I used to really like this Frys store...  It seems like recently their prices have began to all go slightly above retail prices...  Although you can still every once in a while still get a good deal...  But their sales staff have really gone to cr@p.  They used to be great!  They used to really go out of their way to help you...  Not anymore.  Now they are just rude and unacknowledged (most of them I would call plan stupid.)  The general attitude is, "just buy it so I can get a commission on the  sale and get out!"<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp><user>109742977667377691210< /user><date>1304785361650<//date></record>

As a local Depot, they have a lot of selection, however; they're always out of stock on any deal they present and they always find a reason why they don't price match. Oh, yes, no rain checks on sold out deals either. Funny, their deals are, again, always sold out.

They can't compete with Amazon, Newegg, or Microcenter. You're honestly better off spending your money else where and waiting a couple days to get your merchandise.

My 8700k combo with ram was $800 at frys, and $580 at Microcenter, of course frys wouldn't bend.

Of the home stereo equipment that sell, it's so over priced, you're honestly better off dealing with one of the competitors they supposedly price match but always find a reason not to. When it comes down to it, take your business elsewhere.< /Review>

<review>Update 8.28.20. Went in looking for a school laptop, they had two. That's right only 2 laptops. All the display tables empty and so many empty shelves. If you actually need something, go to BestBuy, the chances of fries having something in stock is very low.
Service was not very good or non-existent would be a better description.
I will try to avoid this place in the future.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp><time>1598737965007</time>< gmap_id>

It's very pathetic that their "undercover" shoppers make it so damn obvious they're following you around the whole store. It makes it very uncomfortable for people to shop around especially if they classify you as nonwhite. No customer service skill at all. Finally I walk out with one item in hand and the receipt checker proceeds with asking me can you open the box to make sure nothing else is in there. Haven't been here in over 5 years and I will never come here again. I DO NOT RECCOMEND ANYBODY VISITING THIS GHOSTOWN. Last time I step foot in here. GO TO BESTBUY OR SOMEWHERE ELSE.< /Text>

They are always surprising me with deals on things I would never think to by here. I looked for a new coffee maker online and one came up on Google which was for sale from Fry's. Not only was it perfect but it was less expensive by almost $50 from anywhere else.<//Text>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>I guess if you want something that you used to get at RadioShack you'll now have to go here. Prices are high, help is rare, it's not like it used to be. I can remember the old days when you would walk in and there were one or two attendants trying to Vie for your attention so they could help you find what you needed. Now you will wander down three or four eisles before you will be able to find somebody and they're usually busy with somebody else. They too will probably go out of business as did RadioShack. It's only a matter of time.<//text>< Pics>

<review>I have been purchasing products from Fry's for many years. The last experience I had was when my desk top took a dump and I tried to have the item repaired but unfortunately I was not given good customer service when it comes to returns or repairs. I tried to explain to the Asst manager what took place but I was directed elsewhere.  Ask to speak with a store Mgr was denied that .To make things worse I waited for a call from the repair store and the number they had was not valid, after waiting several weeks to check on the status of my desk top, I was advised another 6 weeks before my desktop will be fixed! I will never recommend or purchase any more items from this store. I am very disappointed in their service after being a loyal customer for years. I rather pay extra to receive great customer service, then be given the run around like I have been this past month!!!!!< /review>< pictures>

Waited 20 minutes for a return then asked a few more questions before he had to leave again. In the end they didn't have any of the computers I looked at in stock (invintory issue). They did offer 5% off. Went home and purchased same laptop from amazon for $400 less, so I guess it was a good thing! Sorry Frys but you lost an easy $1500 bucks. Won't be back. What happened to the customer service.<//Review><rating>2<//rating>< pictures>

Super clean store and easy to navigate through. The service here is much better than the frys down in Mission Valley. They actually have people there to help you that know what they are talking about. If your ever in the need for a variety of electronic options. Frys usually always has the best deals.< /text>

Great place to shop for pc parts. I hate ordering parts online and then end up with a wrong or nonworking component. Frys had almost everything I need in stock and beats the prices at Anson and newegg (plus a few other places). I would of given 5 stars, but the laptop aisle is something to avoid. If you're looking for a laptop, do your research and know what you want before you go in. Those vultures in the laptop department give a great store a bad name.</Review>

I recently stopped by to pick up a gift here. I was furious with the service that was given, we had been standing there for 10-15mins waiting for some assistance and NOT one person came up to greet us to offer help. Shortly a couple had walked up to take a look at the same product we were buying and was greeted in an instant. The guy was told by the couple that they had wanted to purchase that item and he walked away without even bothering to ask if we needed anything, making it obvious that he did not want to help us.. Sucks because my boyfriend had mention to the sales man to grab one for us too. I work in commission as well and I know well I will never judge someone by appearance or make any customer feel unnoticed. He was lucky we even gave him the commission, I was tempted to just ask a different sales person.</Text>

If you looking for great deals, Fry's Electronics in San Marcos has everything you can think of LCD TV, computer networking & testing gear, DIY project, etc.

My kids love the joynormous fish tank and underwater theme.< /Review>

< Review>
Definitely won't be shopping here again. I ordered Beats Solo 3 from their website on Nov 17 and was told that it was available in store for pick up with purchase online. I decided to do it, went in the store, they proceeded to tell me that I needed to order it in store as a special reserve and it would be delivered to the store for pick up in two weeks but it would be charged on the card now. So I did it...

Well, over 1 month later I have no eta and just keep getting told it's on backorder. I guess the worst part is when I called to check, they tried pushing me off saying they'll call me later and don't even ask for my phone number to call me back with. I called the rep out, he acted like he had it, never got a callback.

I learned never to shop with Frys and I'll stick with the more reputable storefronts when needed.<//Review>

Frys is a good electronics store but in the past years I have been stiffed on rebates not being honored.
When I complained to store they say to contact the manufacturer and the manufacturer says contact the store, because this is not there product.
Problem remains unresolved but it's happen on five different occasions, only at Frys and I have not had this problem any where else ever.
I don't do rebates at Frys, I know,slow learner.<//Review>

<Text>This is the WORST frys store ever

The staff is rude and unknowledgeable in almost every department.  They constantly guess at the answer to a question even when they have no idea what you're talking about.

In December I had to go through the returns process 4 different times  due to multiple defective products and getting incorrect product info from the staff.

The only employee who did give me false info was Dennis.  He was too lazy to even give me the wrong answer.  He simply invited me to look online and walked away to his break or something.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Two computer dudes were rude. Didn't know what they were talking about I just wanted a laptop charger and I wanted to see if it fitted on a laptop they were selling.(that I already bought) but they would let me try it until I bought it for $50. They persisted it would work because it had the computer name. Hey dipshit, with your goatee I have a newer laptop it doesn't have a square charging port. Needless to say i wanted to punch him in the throat and wanted to rip his stupid goatee off.<//review>

Everything is out of stock. All the shelves are empty. The employees say it is because of the china tariffs. Maybe they will close and microcenter opens in their place.<//review>

Skip it and go to Wal-Mart. No customer service. Products don't work. No follow-up. No returned calls. The manager needs a lesson in retail management and customer service.<//Text>

It's like a toy store for nerdy guys. The merchandise isn't always organized and the knowledge of the employees is really hit and miss, so know what you want when you go in. Oh and the fishtanks are super cool.</review>

I purchased an item on-line for store pickup in San Marcos, CA store.  When I got there they didn't have item in stock and provided very slow, abysmal customer service.  Wasted 45 minutes of my time.  Will never shop at this deadbeat store again.  Amazon is so much better than dealing with these highly unmotivated employees.< /Review>

The worst experience of my life. I bought two laptops for work for over 500 dollars each from a sales rep and manager named Qi. Less than two months later the laptops hard drives start making a loud grinding noise and  Frys own tech support informs me both hard drives have gone bad and is very noticeable due to the light being on and the horrendous sounds the hard drive was making. Tech support was very friendly and knowledgeable and the best part about frys. When I went to customer service for an exchange customer service rep named Mayra was unfriendly, unwelcoming and even annoyed that we needed her help. She was even amused as she knew they were not going to help us in anyway. Then the same person who sold me the laptops named Qi said they could not exchange it or refund and tech support can not fix it. So basically I'm out over 1000 dollars and the manager above Qi did not even have the decency to talk to me face to face. I can't believe they are selling these overpriced laptops that break down and offer no help. I would give zero stars if I could and I advise everyone to go get your electronics and Best Buy or any other place that will actually take care of you. Please buyers beware.<//Text>

Didn't have what I needed, but purchased something else that worked out for 3 times the price. I guess we should be greatfull that there are still box stores for when you need something in a pinch... Even when they are overpriced ..< /Review>

<text>I can honestly say I will NEVER step foot again in a FRY's store again.  They have the worst customer service.  Need I say more?  If I pay more elsewhere, it will be worth every dime.  They totally do not know how to treat a customer and keep the customer coming back.<//text>< Resp>

They do not match internet prices like their giant sign says. They only marsh a few sites and only when fulfilled by that site. Forget about Amazon and Newegg.</text>

I stopped here at 9:30 AM, but they don't even open until 10:00.  I'll just go shop on Amazon.  You can't sell if you don't open until lunch.  Amazon is sure to be putting these people out of business soon.</text>

<Review>I will do my best to summarize this. I bought a motherboard with a 2 year warranty 6 months ago. I finally have all the parts i need to build my computer. I realize i bought the wrong motheboard for my components. I called and their staff said the manager would understand especially since i have the warranty. I came in immediately was turned down by Laura the manager of the returns and exchange section. She was rude and i attempted to keep it pleasant as I was hoping to have an easy exchange. I eas sent to Richard(Very nice guy and informative) from Components section. He was willing to help and also thought the manager Gaetano Ventrella would understand and help me out. The product was checked out before my upgrade exchange was approved due to the fact that everything was still sealed. After a final inspection their was show of pin damage(I bought this new and sealed). When realizing this he had to double check with the manager again. The manager came over and said he now can not approve of the upgrade exchange.  I asked him to please reconsider as i spend a lot of money here, planning to buy yet another 4k tv from your location  and am about to spend 150.00 more then my original purchase for the right motherboard. He said he is not willing to lose 200.00. I saw that he was unwilling to help me out so i asked to utilize my 2 year warranty and exchange for a new one and ill have to sell on my own i suppose. He said he can not exchange my motherboard because its damaged. I asked him to please reconsider because he himself saw and his employee noticed that the packagings inside were sealed and i now bought defective item from you. He said he can't help me unless I buy the 4k tv from him now and the new motherboard. I felt so angry at that point i told him i was done and id be contacting corporate (end).  This was very unprofessional and unwise as I and my many friends, have been respectful and loyal customers for this location for the past 3 years. I have never had to return an item here but have always purchased the warranties. I will never again visit this location. I will be writing a letter to corporate in hopes they contact me. If they can resolve this issue i will be glad to take my business to alternatr frys location. I will gladly drive and spend the extra gas to avoid doing business with Gaetano Ventrella. If their is no resolution I will ensure to let all i know to stay away from this location as i have already discouraged my close friends to cease and desist from going and spending money at this location.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I frequently buy from Frys (I build computers and enjoy high end headphones). Product selection is subpar (half of what Amazon has if you are willing to wait for shipping), and the customer service is TERRIBLE. I mean T E R R I B L E. Every encounter I have had with a rep (Atleast 25-30 times) has been a bad experience, and all though they are quick to help, they are extremely rude and condescending, or have no knowledge on the topic you may be asking for. I have left Frys feeling bad about myself because of an employee more times then not. Overall, 2 stars for the product selection, and -7 stars for customer service. Boo.</text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><user_id>117199133464461583814< /user_id><text>Probably final review: The shelves really are nearly, or actually empty now. Really sad to see the chain go, but apparently all Fry's are like this. Best Buy is a bit of a joke. I guess all we have left is the Microcenter in Tustin to be the entire state's one good computer component store? Holy cow.

New review: It's a sad day for me indeed, but my once five star rating is now a one star. Since December this location has not replenished it's stock at all. Most of the shelves are FILLED with either large boxes they used to keep in the warehouse area, or with very cheap products that I assume other Fry's locations couldn't sell. It leaves me to speculate, either they are preparing for a big remodel and didn't want to fill up on stock, or what I think is more likely: this location is probably preparing to go out of business. They selection has become such a joke otherwise. Items advertised they not only are out of, but haven't had at this location since November. There is barely anything to browse anymore, they're just missing so much product. It's a really sad state, and downright frustrating to try to find stuff you need here now. If they get their stock back, I'll put my rating back to 5 stars. But at this moment, this doesn't even feel like a Fry's anymore.

Original review: I don't know why so many people are complaining about the service here. Most electronics stores I go to, the staff has no idea what I'm talking about. At Fry's about half the staff actually knows what they're talking about, and honestly that is impressive.
Selection is really good, and among all the Fry's electronics I've been (six of them) this is probably the largest/easiest to navigate.

I know some people prefer the employee going to you, but I hate being asked by every employee at Best Buy if I need help. I don't want to answer the same question every ten seconds. I would much rather go to the employee once I figure out what my question IS. And this is what you can do at Fry's.

To reiterate: If you NEED HELP just go ask them! I don't see why everyone reviewing this fry's seems to want some employee to just follow them through the store. That sounds more annoying, especially when if you bother to ask them a question, they are very friendly!</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I have known and loved Frys for years. Shopped there when they were mostly components to build your own projects or computers.
First NEVER buy returns or opened box items. Having done this and gotten a bad device more than once I will never do it again. Someone probably bought it and either didn't like it, broke it or found it didn't work right, the item was returned, put back in the box, and back on the shelf. They do not inspect returns.
Second They have a big selection more than almost any others
Third Price matching is spotty. I have gotten price matches but I didn't get a match on a Samsung 32GB SDRAM because the online model had an A at the end. The package was identical etc.but still no match.
Fourth employees are not specially trained so don't expect to get difficult questions answered. They know about as much (or a slightly less) than employees in any dept. store.
Fifth  it is one of the few places where you can still walk in and buy components. That won't matter to many but it makes a difference to some of us when we need one more chip, transistor or cap.
So I consider Frys a mixed bag. But still go in once a week.<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9</gmap_id><rating>3</rating>< Pictures>

What a HOAX!!!  The Sunday ad CLEARLY said that this "my Cloud  1TB was available online and instore with FREE shipping.

I placed the item in my cart and found...."instore ONLY".  Well they just lost this sale and since I was
REQUIRED TO SIGN UP FOR THEIR E-MAIL ADS,the first one I get will be PERMANENTLY blocked.  It is called "bait and switch".  Bye, Bye...No buy at Fry's< /Text>

Online order did not go through for in store pick up even though it said it was processing my order. As a result it took me an extra hour and a half to get the thing I wanted. Partly because I couldn't find anyone in the store to ask a question.</review>

<Review>Store manager Gaetano Ventrella will not make any accommodations to return faulty product.  Frys did not disclose that the manufacturer of the $2800 TV we purchased voided the 1 year warranty because our receipt said "open box".   Frys told us this TV was new and not to worry about the "open box".  We did not receive any discount for the "open box" at the time of purchase.  We now have a $2800 tv that does not work at 8 months old.  Frys will not return and Samsung will not repair.</Review>< pictures>

Great selection and good prices - but if there are only 5 people in the whole store, they'll shut down enough registers to ensure your wait to leave is still 10 minutes, haha.</Text>

For the most part grrat place for deals on electronics. Sales people can a bit of just a job attitude. Some times have a real problem with restocking. Not uncommon to walk down a asile and see whole sections of price tags and empty pegs.< /Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Some of the staff at Frys know there stuff, others are dumber then mud fences. I bought a computer from the sales man and unboxed and set it up. Found out the guy sold me the wrong computer (desktop didn't have built in WIFI). So I went back a little upset and asked to return the item. Got a knowledgeable sales man and asked to upgrade my 799.99$ computer to a really nice 1499.99$ gaming computer. We look on the internet and find an awesome deal for 1399.99$ no tax. Sales guy says lets do it, I'm going to get my manager. Manger Fabian Toledo comes over and says no he can't do it. But he can do 1250.00 and I pay taxes. Roughly 1360.00$ after taxes. Im like deal. Fabian then says wait. (Guy has no idea how to do math) I made a mistake. I say okay, lets just honor the 1399.99$ price match. He fights with me for 45min over 32$. In the end Fabian Toledo was rude and called me"dog" (guess he thinks we live in the hood) and never honored my price match.

MORAL of the story: NEVER DEAL WITH FABIAN TOLEDO!!! He's rude, angered, and has not passed 3rd grade mathematics. Feel sorry for someone that loses a 1400.00$ sale over 31-32 dollars.</text>< Pics>

<Review>In store support is excellent, however, if you call and want the option to wait for the next available service representative, you could wait for 20 minutes as I did one time, or at another time, shortly before closing, I finally got a representative and was immediately disconnected.

I hate this place! Worst customer service ever!!! When ever you need someone, they are nowhere to be found and when you do find one...they tell you, "not my Dept."
When you don't need any help they come out of the corners like cockroaches and continually pester you.< /Review>

<text>Well I shop at frys very regularly but every time we go in and buy something the item on the shelf never matches the price tag. Why should it be my job to get on my hands and knees and search numbers to match up the tags. Then when I look around groups of sales people are standing around talking. They need to get it together.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Customer Service Sucks, employees can't be bothered to help you. Understaffed.   Every time I go here I tell myself I'm not going back.   I was going to buy $50 in memory for my computer and a cell phone charger but got rude service so I just left.  This place is going out of business soon I'm sure because of their stupidity.< /Review>

3 hour wait time on Black Friday is not customer friendly. The line snaked throughout the very large store and people were walking out empty handed giving up before reaching the checkout.</text>

Went in to find an obscure plug and sure enough, they had it! Couldn’t find a staff member in sight so it was good that I knew what I was looking for.<//Review>

Last week I saw a ad online for a TV, checked the San Marcos store and it showed "all items available", drove from Temecula to San Marcos only to find they're sold out. The salesperson then checks his computer and says they have 3 in the San Diego store, so I drive to San Diego and they're sold out. Yesterday I was looking for a computer monitor, found it "available" in San Diego, paid for it online for store pickup. 30 minutes later I get an email saying "item not available". I've had it with Frys, maybe they could get Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble to improve they're online shopping service.<//Text>

Customer Service Sucks, employees can't be bothered to help you. Understaffed.   Every time I go here I tell myself I'm not going back.   I was going to buy $50 in memory for my computer and a cell phone charger but got rude service so I just left.  This place is going out of business soon I'm sure because of their stupidity.<//text>

3 hour wait time on Black Friday is not customer friendly. The line snaked throughout the very large store and people were walking out empty handed giving up before reaching the checkout.<//Text>

<review>Nothing good, have an unfixed TV for 5 months now and my warranty is active-they have shitty customer service and only seem to like it when you pay but hovering agreements they know nothing about-reason why frys is always an unpleasant place to make a business transaction-for all TV buyers out there, do not buy a tv from here because all you will get when it breaks down is a bunch of phone numbers and no one answering</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Seems like most of the things that I've purchased there have been returned at one time or another and the people aren't real knowledgeable in their areas unless you get a hold of a senior member but they have a lot of stuff and I liked the place.< /Review>

IF I could give ZERO stars I would. Called before driving 45 minutes to be SURE they had a part. Customer Service said YES. Drove all the way here and NONE don't have the part and haven't had them in Years!< /review>

Large selection of items it's like online shopping in a store. Cheap sodas in the vending machine is a bonus<//text>

(Translated by Google) What can I say about Fry's, which is my favorite shop, have comparable prices with Amazon. In Fry's they equal any advertised price.

They have a wide variety of music products, electronics, PCs, home including washing machines and home appliances.

Here you will find any device that you will hardly find in any retail store.

They have promotions every day and they really have very attractive prices.

(Translated by Google) I had not had the opportunity to know this place but, if you like technology, this place is like disneyland, there are from the simplest cables to super computers, and if you want a special configuration you can easily find what you are looking for in this store, in truth is a store full of products that will make you get excited in each of its corridors. Do not forget to visit it.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Bad service, they did not want the guarantee to be valid since in my opinion the manager or supervisor did not listen to my problem, she reckoned that it was a hit on the TV that I bought but in reality they did not sell a damaged product since from the beginning they I installed my tv it was turned off until I stopped doing it, the tv lasted a few months and they did not want to apply the guarantee that I bought them. BEST BUY from experience is better to apply the refund guarantees.

(Original)
Mal servicio, no quisieron ser valida la garantia ya que en mi opinion la gerente o supervisora no escucho mi problema, ella se ensaño con que era un golpe en la tv que compre pero en realidad ne vendieron un producto dañado ya que desde un inicio que instale mi tv se apagaba hasta que dejo de hacerlo, la tv me duro unos meses y no quisieron aplicar la garantia que les compre. BEST BUY por experiencia es mejor para aplicar las garsntias de devolución.<//Review>
