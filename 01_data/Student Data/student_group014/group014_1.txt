This was my first remodel experience and it was wonderful thanks to Pacific Home Decor. The salespeople was communicative, honest, and extremely friendly. When we wanted something, they would bring you to the section and explain the benefits and negatives of each item. I am obsessed with their super friendly customer service, they were seriously amazing. I can’t recommend PHD more enough, our bathroom is now perfect, I was super satisfied with the material we bought from them. It totally fit our taste and the style of my home.</Text>

I wholeheartedly recommend Pacific Home Decor if you need anything for your home remodels. These guys know their stuff. I can ensure you that when you walk out the store, you will definitely learn a thing or two from the salespeople. The price was very reasonable too and they would give you an estimate whenever there is a change. All in all, I am highly impressed with their service and are hoping to use them again when we home remodel need.< /Text>

<review>Enormous warehouse with a huge selection and by far the best customer service.

I was greeted at the door by Erica. She was sweet enough to give me a tour around the store.

After I told her what I was looking for and what part of the house I wanted to work on. She provided a lot of advice on what I should do and what other customers had done in the past, which is super helpful. Also, she was never pushy, unlike salespeople from some store, Erica was very patient will me. I appreciated her honesty and eager for the customer. Excellent service and beautiful store!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user>115420256500379679032</user><Resp>None</Resp><date>1571293236910< /date><gmapID>0x808f912284398d9d:0x6a5097318bcb04dd<//gmapID>< Name>

If you need knowledgeable and customer-oriented people to help you in planning and design your next kitchen, this is the store for you, definitely check them out.

Erica created the kitchen that we wanted to have, she listened attentively to our expectation and requirement while giving us good feedback on our initial idea.

We only had a few visits and meeting with Erica, and she already remember what direction we are heading toward along with our taste. She made sure that we are updated all the time.

You want the top service and that is what you are going to have in pacific home decor.</text>

I have been working with Pacific Home Decor for a while now. I have always appreciated their profession and their attention to detail. Addition, they always have and remained an excellent service for customers. We are now working on my bathroom right now, although it has yet to be completed, I am confident that it will be done professionally. I am excited to see the end result of the bath room.</text>

<text>I know that finding a good cabinetry for our kitchen is not easy but very fortunately I found this place. They are the best store I have been so far. The store is huge and had a variety of selections, and customer service is top notch. We remodeled our kitchen with their help, we started with nothing and now we had our kitchen design. I bought all the cabinets we need and they also referred a contractor for us, and that saved us a lot of time on finding a contractor. Now, I just have to wait for the contractor to finish our kitchen, I cannot wait to see our beautiful kitchen.</text><time>1570252817341</time><username>Eds Mathews</username><Rating>5< /Rating><GmapID>0x808f912284398d9d:0x6a5097318bcb04dd<//GmapID></record>

I could not be happier with our choice to go with this company, and the A+ team! I don't think you can go wrong with this company, look for Jennifer and Rachel. Their custom cabinets are really contemporary and modern.  They are not the cheapest quote you are going to receive, but the quality and durability of the cabinets is well worth the cost. I strongly recommend them!</Text>

I'm in need of a bathroom vanity and so I went to the store that my friend always talk about. In surprise, they have many styles and sizes of vanity. I like how the countertop is mix and match, meaning I can pick my own countertop and match it with the cabinet that I want.< /review>

Pacific Home Decor is the best remodeling store I have ever shopped with. Go there and talk to Hao. Not only because they have a variety of tiles, floors, cabinet and vanity, but also they have most of them in stock (even if not, the lead time is very reasonable). We purchased the whole kitchen cabinet, counter top, and some other stuffs, and it turned out to be FANTASTIC-- absolutely loved those! If you are into contemporary, modern design, PHD is the best among the whole bay area-- both quality and pricing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED with my first Google Review.< /Review>

<review>Pacific Home Decor is one of the best in the area without any doubt. I had gone to a dozen places such as Home Depot, Ikea, and NGY before coming to PHD. I would say this store had totally blown me away by their stunning customer service and materials quality. I would give them a hundred stars if this was ever an option. Anyway, I came to PHD, hoping to remodel my stupid looking kitchen. I was helped by their manager, at first I thought he is a little too young and lack of experience to assist me. But, as we started to talk a little bit more, he completely changed how I view him. He is able to answer all my questions in a way that I would understand too, and he also gave me some great tips on how to design my kitchen. Additionally, he is able to show me the exact 3D model of what my future kitchen is going to look like and an estimate of everything. I was able to enjoy my time while remodeling my kitchen with him. I had a great time working with him, and I would definitely recommend this store to anyone that is hoping to remodel their lovely home.

< Review>
Really love this place, they carry some very high-quality cabinet and elegant mosaic tiles at a very reasonable price. Definitely better than Lowe’s and Home Depot and will be back for my next future house.< /Review>

PHD and a Kenny Zheng are great to work with. The selection and quality were just what I was looking for. With their help, we were able to transform our new kitchen into an updated classic kitchen which we will enjoy for years to come. I highly recommend PHD and Kenny for future cabinetry needs.</Review>

<Review>I had a very hard time finding the right place to purchase my cabinets for my kitchen and I just happened to be in Hayward checking out different supplier. I decided to check this place out since I got nothing better to do so I told myself “why not”. I am glad that I did not skip this store.<//Review>< user>

Gary and Yvette were amazingly helpful representatives. Yvette made my reservation and Gary got me set up with my actual storage unit & contracts. They were extremely welcoming and answered every question with patience and thorough detail. I appreciate this level of customer service as moving is stressful! Their office had a variety of supplies to purchase and I found the facility to be extremely convenient and clean. I’m really happy with my selection I shopped around and this was the best deal in my area. It’s a bonus that the employees are also so kind & considerate.< /Text>

BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER 👌
I've recently returned from the storage unit i rented, Even before entering the establishment i was welcomed in by Yvette and she Even held the door open for this old man. She then introduced herself and her co- worker Barry. They were not only professional but personable as well, they took the time to hear my needs and let me share a few of life's experiences and laughed along with me.
As for the business/ facilities, the building is VERY NICE!!! Clean and secure. I seriously feel this will be the best place for my property's and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE 👌</review>

Their prices are pretty competitive too since they have specials going on. I have another smaller storage unit in Denver and it costs me more in Colorado.
Customer service is amazing (by Ivette), I got all my deal done in minutes via phone, so by the time I made it there with my stuff everything was ready for me.
I feel like all my stuff is at a very reliable and secure place for a very good price.
Highly recommended!!!< /Review>< user_name>

Yvette and staff have been amazingly supportive of me while I had to move things into my storage unit alone with a broken foot during a month when I had to hurry and get things out of the house I was selling. When I couldn't walk to the office to get the key for the cart/dolly, she brought it to me at the elevators so I wouldn't suffer through the move. Everyone is pretty polite and friendly here, which makes it pleasant to come to the storage unit. I am used to storage companies with indifferent or curt staff but Yvette and crew have been really positive and helpful.  The team at 1000 N Main St. make StorQuest look good and thus put the storage company on my radar for future storage needs.<//Review>

Thank you so much Yvette. Honestly some of the best customer service, she took her time to break down the prices to see what works best for me and gave me a quick run down of the facility. This location was extremely well maintained and air conditioned which is a plus. Would highly recommend!!!<//Review>

I was prepared to take my business to another company due to poor poor customer service. The main reason was they say your rate will increase 15% in 6 months. My rate increased +25% in 6 months. No explanation but many excuses.

Today that changed when I met Victoria at the StorQuest, 1000 N Main Street Los Angeles. The service and location is night and day. Victoria cared and offered many solutions to meet my needs. I feel confident I made the right choice to change locations. The place is very clean, easy access, and spacious. Close to freeways. Lots of parking.< /Review>< rate>

It’s my first time paying for a storage unit and Yvette was really helpful. She talked to me about the pricing and showed me the unit I requested before moving my items and answered all my questions. She was super kind in offering to show me other units I may need if my needs exceeded the one I paid for. She explained to me the pricing in boxes and other helpful tips in moving my items in.

Love this place already ! Excellent customer service!!
Called in a day ago to get a unit , an associate reserved one for me over the phone. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to make it in that same day so they held my reservation and contacted me telling me they had did so. They called the next morning checking to see if I was okay and still interested in the unit . I ended up coming in and was greeted by Ref . He showed me my unit I loved it! Lol Within minutes I was out with a new clean big affordable storage unit! I’ve been to other storage companies and was never treated so nice they just wanted to get my money and get on with their day. This one is different I didn’t feel rushed or anything. Ref took his time to show me the unit and how to easily get to and from my car. I’d definitely recommend this location!!! Oh and it’s new ! So big and clean lol !<//review>

A leading and remarkable grocery shop had brought significance to my life. Their existence was a great help to any housewife like me that aspired to buy some groceries for a low price only. Their products were in proper and organized displays, that’s why it was easy for me to locate everything that was listed on my grocery list.</review>

< review>
It was okay. If I lived in the neighborhood, this might be a place I went to off and on, but this would not be my go to place.  The produce was just okay.  At least I could get plantains but the ginger us from China and smells like it sat in a tanker after being sprayed with chemicals. There is a deli but I didn't try it. Mostly, the store is full of boxes processed junk food. There is Mexican pan that looked fresh. People were friendly but overall, after passing this place for. Year and imagining Caribbean fruits, it was sorely disappointing to find the same ole same ole but just over priced and mediocre. There has got to be a better market nearby. Laguna Market used to my place for this stuff it unfortunately closed due to gentrification and high rents. Sad.<//review>

I shop here every chance I get.
The prices are ok but it saves a trip to the overcrowded supermarkets in the area....nostalgia is a plus oh and they get daily French roll delivery from French Pacific Bakery (my fave!!) Meat counter has nice little sales sometimes and the cashiers are friendly!</Text>

<Review>I always find everything I need, it's close to home, and the prices aren't that bad. I would give them all 5 stars, but there's one cashier girl who clearly doesn't wish to be working there, and you can tell this by the look on her face and her rudeness. Everyone else is totally cool.</Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< userid>

<Review>Bottle Mexican Coke.

Pretty much the main reason I stop by Big 6.

Worth a visit if:

You live in the neighborhood obviously, because it's convenient.

I really enjoyed this place! Cheap beers! Cash only establishment which forced me to go an ATM next door. Make sure you being cash with you. But, other than that, played pool all day 150$ for a table of 10-15 players.<//text>

I've been going to Rack & Cue Billiards on Katella and Western for awhile, but frankly, I like International Billiards much better! Just started coming here a few weeks ago, so so far, great service, and much better price at $7/hr compared to Rack & Cue's $12/hr.</review>

< Review>
This Westminster billiards spot located next to the 405 freeway has a bargain happy hour. The tables are well maintained. Cold beer starts at $3. This pool hall has improved through the decades going through different ownership. Joe currently is the owner and he will make an effort to get to know you.<//Review>

This place is very old and outdated. Incredibly dusty and has a lot of sketchy locals. No liquor but it does have beer. Inexpensive place to play pool, but I think there are better places to go.</text>

Joe is the best
He has nice big tv screen
Loud music
Easy going. Kick it. Chill have a good time leave the shot on the streets
International billiards is your home and everyone's home
To rest relax n have freedom from the world outside
Love it or stay away respect it
Or it may go away</text>

I enjoy this pool hall. I've been here about a dozen times. I could see myself spending alot of time here. The staff is very accommodating and so geniunely friendly. I have an out of control addiction to pool. If you see me there, let's play! I'm usually wearing a Yankee hat or a colorful beanie...and trying not to stare at the most beautiful girl in all of the world...and bank shots ain't a problem for me. They go in all day. All day. All. Day.<//text>

Love this place, here probably about four times a week for hours. I think 15 full sized tables at an hourly rate and two bar sized tables for 75 cents a game. Just wish they had some kind of membership,  I end up blowing too much money on my days off with my buddies playing doubles against others for the entirety of the night.< /review>

Beers cheap, pools cheap, cute and friendly bartenders, jukebox bumps pretty hard. I see alot of potential for this place, but I like that it's not crowded or obnoxiously loud. Used to go to Danny k's to play pool, but now strictly come here. Looks almost exactly like linbrook family billiards. This place is awesome.</review>

I've been shooting pool here for 4 years now. I love this place. Great rates even though the price was hiked up still beats most joints especially considering the staff and owner are top knotch.

Leave the drama behind and rack a few games out to some great tunes.

The back parking lot has alot of broken glass so I'd stay closer to the front, or park to the left side near the flower place and Jiu-Jitsu gym.< /Text>

< Review>
Went yesterday morning and took a friend for his birthday. It was an absolute blast.  Terry was our pilot and was very easy going and knowledgeable about his city.  One of the best things I've ever done.  Felt totally safe and comfortable. Thanks for the experience.<//Review>

I booked a flight a week before my trip to San Diego. After reading all the reviews about Corporate Helicopters I seen Terry Frost The pilot was mentioned in almost every review that I had seen. And let me tell you, that man is one of the most easy going, funny, and entertaining pilots out there I’m sure. It was a blast! And also this was the first time me or my girlfriend have ever been in a helicopter and he was very professional and also well educated about the aircraft letting our first time ease the nerves for future trips. 10/10 definitely recommend coming to corporate helicopters if it is your first time flying or just for the good vibes!!<//review>

Best way to see San Diego, spectacular views with an outstanding pilot.  Ivor took us everywhere we thought we wanted to go and then some.  Highly recommend a ride with Ivor for any special day....</review>

<user>114199687685982434584< /user><review>I took my girlfriend on this date as we had never been on one before and being blown away from the experience is an understatement. It is certainly an experience I recommend everyone to try at least once in their life!

Although the experience is worthy of five stars, I would say that it's a distant second to the experience and professionalism of our Pilot, Terry Frost. The man was enthusiastic, kept things light hearted, and was knowledgeable of all the history of San Diego's landmarks. Even being born and raised in San Diego, I learned so much and Terry's professionalism pushed the experience over the edge to be worthy of going back for more than once! 10/10 without a doubt! Thanks Terry and the CH team!

I decided to surprise the woman i love with the winery lunch that i combined with the romance package and it was incredible. Our pilot was terry. Through all the flights ive had, ive never had anyone more professional and informative as him. He was funny and kind and very knowledgeable about the city. Our flight to temecula was perfect with no issues. Our issue was timing and coordination with the Corporate helicopter and Callaway vineyard tour and tasting as the tour is only done at 11am and 2pm. So it should be something that should be hatched out since our flight left at 11am from san diego and we would leave at 2pm from the winery. But apart from that. Terry showed us am amazing view of san diego i have never seen and gave me and my gf and incredible memory we will never forget. Thank you guys<//review>

Terry was exceptional! I was surprising my then girlfriend to a helicopter ride /proposal to Callaway Winery. Corporate Helicopters has a fantastic relationship with Callaway Winery and everything was timed perfectly. Terry did an amazing job of hiding the secret of the proposal and destination until the decent. She had no idea we were going to the winery. The flight was comfortable with cold AC unlike other helicopters we've ridden. Terry was very smooth with his take off and landing. My now fiance was not scared with the flight and we enjoyed all the commentary and tour Terry provided. I was very intrigued with all the knowledge he had with San Diego County. The views of our flight was beautiful. The ride home by the coast was stunning. Highly recommend Terry and the winery tour they provide.</Review>

Absolutely incredible experience. I booked a tour for an anniversary and was blown away from the second we walked through the door. Champagne and chocolate was waiting for us along with Terry, our awesome pilot. He made sure to take plenty of pictures and had a great sense of humor which made the trip that much better. I would recommend requesting Terry if possible. Our flight felt safe and was very informative. I’ve lived in San Diego my whole life and saw things I never had before.< /text>

Our pilot, Terry, came in just for our booking and waited to take off to ensure the sun would be setting during our flight. He gave us a great tour of the city and kindly talked about many landmarks and/or places below. Since we had done a lot of driving to most of the sites, it was a really awesome experience to then see them high in the sky. Thank you to Terry and the extremely kind staff at Corporate Helicopters. They went above and beyond for me as a first time Helicopter rider!</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEnVOWF80HjtywdMl3kyn4AkZtYbp_FuHAKFum=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

Brought my boyfriend as a surprise and he loved it! I did too of course. Terry was our pilot and was amazing at explaining locations, keeping the mood great and including us to not just be sitting in the back. Great sense of humor and very professional. Definitely one of the best experiences I’ve ever had and my boyfriend as well. Recommend 10/10<//Text>

I booked a tour to surprise my girlfriend on her birthday and we both had an amazing time. Corporate Helicopters made the reservation super easy and we got in the air quickly.

We also had the pleasure of having Terry Frost as our pilot! He was extremely personable and brought a great sense of humor to the flight which made any nerves go away. Mr. Frost also knew a ton of historical, geographical, and insightful information which he shared with us along the flight. Mr. Frost not only made us feel safe and like we were having fun, but it is obvious that he genuinely enjoys etching this joyous experience into people’s lives.

Not only do I recommend flying with this company and if you have the choice, with Terry Frost as your pilot, but feel it is a MUST-DO to help one capture the entire essence of San Diego from a birds eye view. I have lived in San Diego for over 5 years and had not realized just how beautiful the city was.

Cheers!<//review>

I booked a tour for an anniversary and was blown away from the second we walked through the door. Champagne and chocolate was waiting for us along with Terry, our awesome pilot.

Our flight felt safe and was very informative. I’ve lived in San Diego my whole life and saw things I never had before.</Text>< Rate>

<text>Truly a amazing experience. Booked the romantic flight and I had kept it a surprise to my girlfriend and I was truly surprised on how they had it set up upon arriving. I didn’t expect the bottle to be chilled with chocolates, rose pedals in a heart shape and the sign with our names welcoming us. Truly amazing and friendly people our pilot terry was amazing and a lot of fun and has very good jokes. Will consider coming back to do their lunch and wine tasting flight sometime for sure. Again truly amazing and did so much better than I could ever except! Thank you guys for a amazing flight and experience!!<//text>< pictures>

What an amazing experience! I had booked the winery lunch and flight as part of my proposal to my now fiancé. Ivor made sure everything went as planned and accommodated everything I needed. This was our first time in a helicopter and our pilot Terry did such an outstanding job, smooth as can be! We already want to go on another ride!</Review>

Helicopter Tour with Terry
My partner and I make it our mission to explore each city we visit from above and love that view from a helicopter. While there are a handful of companies to choose from, the decision should end here. Corporate Helicopters is hands down our favorite. Not only did we feel like the tour was justified in length for cost, but our guide Terry was absolutely phenomenal. He not only made us feel safe, but he gave us an authentic perspective of San Diego. He was extremely quick witted and funny, and took note of different things we were saying to provide insight that resonated with us. When we landed we were also informed about the other side of Corporate Helicopters that works with the film industry and has some credits in films like TITANIC. Choosing CH is a no brainer, just book it!<//Text>

<Review>I wanted to get my boyfriend a gift he would enjoy and remember for his 28th birthday. He was surprised, excited and very happy. We got the best customer service from the start even before we stepped inside the door. All the employees were very kind and accommodating. They even offered for us to come back for a second flight if the haze didn't clear up enough in the city. Thankfully it did and it was amazing. Our pilot Terry only made the trip so much better with his humorous, knowledgeable, and professional interaction. Our in-flight experience was so smooth and enjoyable thanks to the Terry's expert flying.  Hands down the best way to experience the city whether you are form the area or not. A second reservation is definitely in our near future! Happiest customer!< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOB5643CIghhGQ_Exsz2p_JBAdld-HfeOCJVJoC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzSHgPLspfa4p4dPG0dlvfrLIle-H4FMmF70Ml=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQBdyZ43BeBPx4Coa442Cj3ER7hQpQevGOt6IQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

We took our second Corporate Helicopter ride this week. Our pilot, Terry, was amazing and a lot of fun. They whole experience is great and the company is well organized and always willing to go the extra mile to accommodate us. The time before we had Marshall as our pilot who was equally as fun and helpful. I would definitely recommend them for any tours or charters you need!<//Text>

<Text>Terry took us on a flight from Montgomery field to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park over to Torrey Pines down to Point Loma and across the city. He kept us entertained with great jokes and some really awesome views. I highly recommend taking this flight over one of the most beautiful areas in California.< /Text><userid>103408436515638765121< /userid><rating>5< /rating>< GmapID>

Amazing experience. Marshall was our pilot. He was very kind, informative, witty, and a awesome pilot. We felt safe and were in good hands. The young lady at the front desk was attentive and very nice. The entire experience from beginning to end was five stars.< /text>

<Text>This opportunity was the perfect way to tie a little trip to San Diego all together. Our pilot, Terry, came in just for our booking and waited to take off to ensure the sun would be setting during our flight. He gave us a great tour of the city and kindly talked about many landmarks and/or places below. Since we had done a lot of driving to most of the sites, it was a really awesome experience to then see them high in the sky. Thank you to Terry and the extremely kind staff at Corporate Helicopters. They went above and beyond for me as a first time Helicopter rider!</Text>< Time>

I have been wanting to do this for a very long time and I finally decided to book it for my boyfriends birthday celebration. I was very nervous but Terry (our pilot) made the experience fun, exciting and made me feel comfortable. My boyfriend and I loved the ride and couldn't have asked for a better time. Thank you to Terry and everyone at Corporate Helicopter for an amazing time and for being awesome all around. Will definitely recommend to others! Never change Corporate Helicopter, Terry, you are the real MVP !< /Review>

Amazing experience! The whole team at Corporate Helicopters was great to work with as I set up a surprise tour for my fiancée.

<Review>Best thing I have done in San Diego amongst the 10+ times I’ve been. The views are phenomenal. The tour is very informative and fun. Definitely ask for Terry Frost (Pilot).

Terry is an exceptional and confident pilot, tour guide, and entertainer. He settles the nerves of any of the more nervous passengers immediately. He has a true skill for relaxing and entertaining anyone on his flight. This was the highlight of our vacation.

I cant recommend this experience enough; it is one I will never forget. Thank you Corporate Helicopters. We will be back soon!< /Review>< Time>

Corporate Helicopters is the only helicopter operator to use in southern California. From their competitive prices, excellent customer service and highly professional pilots to their top notch facility and maintenance / avionics staff they are a step above the rest. The owners are intimately involved in the day to day operations of the company and are always available to make sure you are taken care of. I've come across many helicopter operators that cut corners to maximize profits. You won't find that at Corporate, they are adamant about doing things right and providing a dependable safe service to their clients. Mandy their vice president of operations is lovely to work with and moves heaven and earth to come through with every request I bring her. Whatever your helicopter operation needs, Corporate Helicopters of San Diego has the experience and expertise to help you complete your mission safely and efficiently.</Review>

Corporate Helicopters is very friendly and professional. Everyone there was so helpful and made it a really great experience. We did the 'Romance in the Air' package. Loved it, would do it again.<//Review>

<text>This was the most amazing tour ever and I recommend it to everyone. Terry was the best tour guide who does a great job at making you laugh the whole time, it helps distract you too if you are nervous about going in a helicopter. The views were breath taking and Terry pointed out everything to you. If anyone wants a different view of San Diego and a fun trip, definitely go through here!! Might have to do it again sometime soon.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Best thing I have done in San Diego amongst the 10+ times I’ve been. The views are phenomenal. The tour is very informative and fun. Definitely ask for Terry Frost (Pilot).

Terry is an exceptional and confident pilot, tour guide, and entertainer. He settles the nerves of any of the more nervous passengers immediately. He has a true skill for relaxing and entertaining anyone on his flight. This was the highlight of our vacation.

I cant recommend this experience enough; it is one I will never forget. Thank you Corporate Helicopters. We will be back soon!<//review>< Pictures>

Our flight was smooth, his narration was both informative and amusing – at times bordering on hilarious if I'm being thorough – and it was one of the highlights to our visit! I will add that I use a wheelchair which he was more than happy to accommodate and my impressions are that he will go out of his way to support and accommodate all who come to fly with him. Wheels up to Terry!<//Text>< Rate>

<review>I highly recommend corporate helicopters! The experience is definitely unforgettable. I started off booking with Adrenaline and they took forever to respond & ended up canceling. Then I stumbled on corporate helicopters and I'm so glad i found them & booked it. We celebrated my finances 35th birthday & we did the ROMANCE Tour. It came with Champagne, 30 min tour. When we arrived they had it all set up for us and I didn't expect them to have this setup. I mean Chocolate, rose petals, two custom champagne glasses and beautiful back drop where we took photos before the tour. We were lucky to have  an amazing pilot "TERRY" who took majority of our photos. Terry is really funny and kind. My fiance was really nervous about this tour and Terry did a really good job explaining everything to him and making him laugh.Thank you Terry for this amazing tour. We would do it all over again!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>First time at Corporate Helicopters.  I must say it was superb!  Everything from the reservation to the flight was easy.  Calvin in the front office and Pilot Terry were great and they helped willingly with a couple of requests.  My son was apprehensive to ride in front but Terry put him at ease and now he's hooked!  Prices are very fair as well.  Can't say enough good things.  Highly recommend the company and the experience!<//Text>< Pics>

We took flight with pilot Terry Frost to celebrate our anniversary. From start to finish the experience was wonderful. I booked online, which was a breeze, you are able to see all the flight packages they offer, where they fly and what the price is. After booking,I received an email confirmation and a second confirmation the day before our flight as a reminder. When we arrived they had a table set up with chocolates and champagne, rose petals were scattered on the table as well. The ladies at the front checking us in were welcoming and advised us our pilot was checking the helicopter and would be right in. Terry came in and introduced himself and asked if we had flown previously and had any questions. He served us some champagne and then off to do some final checks. We were taken to the copter in a golf cart and given some safety info, then with champagne in hand we were off. It's no secret San Diego is a beautiful city -to see it from another perspective and get a sweeping view of the cliffs at Torrey Pines, fly over our world famous zoo and see Padres stadium from high above was a truly amazing experience. Thank you Terry for your professionalism, charm and knowledge. You made our experience wonderful! We will be back :)< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>All aspects from booking to flying has been absolutely amazing with Corporate Helicopters. Calvin was very thorough and patient in answering all of my questions concerning which helicopter ride would be a better fit experience wise and budget wise for my boyfriend and I. He made some great suggestions, including time of flight, that ended up being perfect for us.

Our pilot, Terry Frost, is hilarious, kind, and well versed on the sights. He started off the trip with humor, which helped my boyfriend and I relax as we were slightly anxious as it was our first time on a helicopter. Terry went over the safety speech effectively and ensured both of us were bucked in securely and comfortably before we lifted off. He explained the reasoning behind why we don't walk behind the helicopter. He was thorough in describing locations to us from an arial view, and was able to well manage communication to his team while showing us breath taking views of San Diego (also while enjoying a stunning sunset).

The flight was breath taking, and beyond what we expected. My boyfriend and I have already started looking into other flights we could take in the future since we may have become helicopter addicts due to this flight!</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I surprised my girlfriend with the Diego Delight tour of San Diego. After checking out the competition and their pricing, I felt that Corporate Helicopters was the best deal. Our pilot Terry was very nice and funny. While being locals, we would have preferred a less pedestrian overview of San Diego, we appreciate that not everyone who does the tours knows about SD like we do.

Overall an AMAZING trip and we would totally do it again!<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< name>

I surprised my girlfriend with the Diego Delight tour of San Diego. After checking out the competition and their pricing, I felt that Corporate Helicopters was the best deal. Our pilot Terry was very nice and funny. While being locals, we would have preferred a less pedestrian overview of San Diego, we appreciate that not everyone who does the tours knows about SD like we do.

Overall an AMAZING trip and we would totally do it again!<//Text>

This was the experience of a lifetime! Took my girlfriend up on Valentines Day and we had a blast! Took the Diego Delight tour and can't wait to see the other tours.
Very impressed with the staff and our pilot Terry. Super clean and well kept aircraft -we felt safe in the hands of the CH staff and so were able to just.....enjoy what we were actually seeing. We have been San Diego locals all our lives and had NEVER seen the area in this way. So beautiful words cant describe.
My girlfriend is only unhappy about one part: the fact that I wont stop walking around telling people I'm going to buy a helicopter now!
Great big thank you to Corporate Helicopters and to anyone reading this ; this experience is priceless, the memories and pictures from this day will be remembered for the rest of our lives.<//review>

Terry the Pilot is a great guy and lots of fun, from first meeting him until the end.  He is very knowledgeable, funny, and professional as well.  I suggest, even if you live in San Diego that you do this ride at least once.  I will definitely be going again!</review>< Pictures>

WOW! This was the best!  As a surprise I wanted to take my 91 yr old Dad on a Helicopter ride but wasn't sure which company to go with. I did a little research and it seemed like Corporate Helicopters rec'd the best reviews.  And the ratings were absolutely correct!  They were the nicest and sweetest people ever!  The tour was amazing!  Our pilot Mitchell was especially patient with my hard-of-hearing Dad.  We felt comfortable and in good hands, not a worry at all!  They are super affordable ($324 for up to 3 people) and this tour is really worth every penny!   When back in San Diego we will do this again for sure!!< /Review>

Today was our very first time riding in a helicopter, we were welcomed by Terry whom was extremely hilarious. We loved every second of this experience and will always recommend coming here and even come back in the near future. We will never forget terry’s safety dance (:  thank you all for an amazing experience!< /Text>

<text>I moved to San Diego 3 months ago with the intention of doing a discovery flight with Corporate Helicopters.  I absolutely loved it and want to pursue learning to fly helicopters.  My instructor Josh was amazing and has great techniques of teaching.  He described concepts in the correct terminology but can easily convey to someone who is just learning and relate to other aspects in order for the student to understand what he is teaching.  He was very positive and loves what he does. Corporate Helicopters is great, very nice and enthusiastic staff and is in a great location.  I go there sometimes just to hang out and gaze at the helicopters.  Thanks a lot Corporate Helicopters, I loved my experience and hope there will be more in the near future!!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>Best Helicopter Tour Company in San Diego! I wouldn't bother looking at any other operator in Southern California.  Jeannette helped me book the perfect tour for my family - The Surf & Turf Tour.  It was 1 hour of scenic bliss! This was our first experience in the helicopter and our pilot Peter made us feel safe and well prepared for the flight.

THIS WAS THE BEST EXPERIENCE! I'm so thrilled we booked our tour< /Text>< Gmap_id>

I will never forget the glint of the afternoon sun off the water as we cruised down the La Joya coastline and past Mission Beach.

<review>Our tour was just this past Tuesday (10/30/18) and it was FANTASTIC!!!!!!! I got this as a birthday present for my fiancé because he’s never been in a helicopter and it was his first time in San Diego and he LOVES avation. He loved it!!!!!! Our pilot Terry was absolutely wonderful. He was funny, informative, accommodating, professional, and safe. Their online system was easy to navigate. I got him the romance package and got to drink champagne while seeing the sunset over the ocean and city. I cannot recommend this place enough!!! Excellent experience, professional staff, safe and fun environment all wrapped into an amazing flight.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Once in a lifetime experience! This is a world-class run organization in terms of quality and safety. We were greeted when we walked in the door with a big smile. We used the restroom before we went on our tour and it was luxurious and very clean. We then met our pilot Terry, who was a fun personality and instantly made you feel comfortable. Terry showed us the Helicopter hanger and drove us to the tarmac where our helicopter was located. Terry reviewed the safety features and then took pictures of my fiancé' and I in front of the aircraft. Our first impressions were that we felt extremely safe and excited.

We took off and started communicating over the voice activated headsets. Riding in a helicopter feels like flying around on a cloud! It's the coolest feeling to experience ever! We toured the San Diego country from a bird's eye and the views were absolutely stunning! We've lived in San Diego for the last 10 years, and nothing compares to the beauty you see from 1,000 feet floating around in a Corporate Helicopter tour!

We rate this experience a 10/10 across the board in terms of quality, safety, fun, and memories. Thanks for everything!</Review>

Just came off a tour. William was our pilot. Such a smooth flight. Showed us tons of stuff we would have never seen from the ground. Flew above the coastline for a while and then came back. I highly recommend this to anyone in the San Diego area. Once again, awesome job William. Thank you Corporate Helicopters.</review>

<review>Came to San Diego for a training but had a few days to enjoy the sights before the training began.  Decided we would check out a helicopter tour since we'd never been here and found Corporate Helicopters online.  Liked their Unforgettable tour and was able to book it the same day.  Showed up a little early and everyone was very friendly, and our pilot, Terry, was awesome.  Neither my wife or I had flown in a helicopter before so this was a new experience for both of us, and we both commented afterwards that it was like floating in the air.  My wife gets motion sick pretty easy but didn't have a problem at all with the flight.  Great experience, great pilot and we'll have to do it again when we bring our daughter back!  Thanks Terry for a great flight!</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dbffdb4b2dc953:0x941e7da46580bfe8</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This was such a fun experience! Saw amazing parts of SD I never even knew existed...We started inland and flew up to Rancho Santa Fe...saw some HUGE mansions...and then made our way down the coast line down to Hotel Del Coronado and then flew over Downtown SD as the sun set over the ocean. Well worth the investment. Pilot was very informative and very smooth take off and landing. Thank you Corporate helicopters!</Review>< Pics>

WOW!!! I can't say enough wonderful things about this trip.  Corporate helicopters really made our flight around San Diego amazing.  The views were breathtaking and you were really able to see the best view of the San Diego coast and the cliffs.  What really topped this trip off was the stop at a local winery where my boyfriend proposed to me :)  I can’t thank corporate helicopters enough for helping make that day so special!<//text>

<text>My boyfriend surprised me and took me on the "Surf and Turf" tour for Valentine's Day. It was incredible! Our favorite parts were seeing the San Diego Wild Animal Park from the air, seeing a whale in La Jolla, flying by downtown, and seeing Coronado. Our pilot / tour guide was Bryan, and he couldn't have been nicer. He was more than happy to loop around and see a couple nice houses that we liked. I really recommend it!< /text><user_name>Shannon Pfeifer</user_name>< rating>

<review>My grandfather turned 94 recently, and he told us that he had never been in a helicopter.  He was a pilot before WWII and has always been an aviation enthusiast.  My sister and I decided to take him on a tour around San Diego.  We chose to use Corporate Helicopters' services.

The staff at Corporate Helicopters was professional and friendly.  After a short safety briefing, we were on our way.  Our pilot was skilled with her aircraft and knowledgeable of the San Diego area.  She flew us over many of the coastal area's most notable landmarks.

We could not be more pleased with our experiences at Corporate Helicopters and I will gladly recommend them to anyone looking to go up in the air in the San Diego area.</review>< response>

I took a young Navy boy on the 60-minute flight over San Diego and the surrounding area.  He is stationed on the Carl Vincent and was totally stoked to be going on a helicopter.  We both had a blast.  It wasn't my first ride but it was certainly my favorite one.  The staff were awesome and our pilot was fabulous and even if he's just faking it(he wasn't), he is very engaging and interested in who you are and where you come from.  I can't wait to come back and take my daughter who missed this flight because she was sick back at the hotel.<//Review>

<review>My husband and I took the San Diego tour for our 20th anniversary. It was my first time in a helicopter. I was scared at first but the pilot was great and the views were awesome! I will never forget the view off the ocean in the afternoon sun, watching people surf the waves. I can't wait to take my children on a wonderful adventure.<//review>< rate>

Fantastic!!!! I have gone on helicopter trips only 3 times in my lifetime (I am 53). At 17yrs from Las Vegas through the Grand Canyon with my parents, and then 2 years ago over Manhattan with my daughter.
Now, what this trip did not have the same in sights to offer, but it sure was compensated by the service and flight experience.  Very quaint, very friendly.  San Diego and its coast are beautiful.  The ground staff and the pilot just fantastic.  Unlike the "commercial" feeling of the other trips, this one is like going on a flight with your friend who is the pilot.
This time, also, it was my very romantic trip with my girlfriend.
Now, let me tell you, the next day, which is tomorrow, I am taking both of my daughters on the very same trip.
Corporate Helis is not rated 4.9 of 5 on google for no reason.  I shall come back to take their longer distance Mexico trips as well.
A grand experience! And I do travel the world!<//review>

If you are ever in San Diego, you have to go visit Corporate Helicopters and take a tour. I was PETRIFIED....but I didn't want to not do it a regret it later. I am SO glad I did. Our pilot was great and I was so comfortable. It was one of the highlights of my trip!</Review>

<Text>I surprised my  son with The Unforgettable Helicopter Tour for his 11th Birthday. His older brother and I blind-folded him and put on ear buds so he would have no idea where he was going. We took off the blindfold when he was sitting in the Helicopter and when he opened his eyes and saw the Helicopter, his jaw dropped.
Our pilot, Terry Frost, was so charming. He even sang him Happy Birthday! Terry did a fantastic job Touring us and pointing out all of the important landmarks San Diego has. There was a baseball game at Petco Park that had gone into extra innings and that meant that there was a restriction on flying over Petco Park and Downtown San Diego while the game was still going. Terry did not want us to miss out on this part of the tour, but he kept checking with Lindbergh Field to see when the the restriction would be lifted and he made a huge effort to time our Tour along the Coast just right so that we would still have time to make a pass over Petco Park. This added effort made a huge difference in the tour. I had done this Tour about 13 years ago with Corporate Helicopters and it was amazing. When I looked them up again, I knew I was in great hands and their staff was beyond patient with all of my questions prior to booking the tour. I was so excited to show my boys how lucky we are to live in such a beautiful city. I can't wait to do this again!!!< /Text>< Pics>

WOW!!  What a wonderful experience with Corporate Helicopters.  I first learned about this company on FOX News when Heather, Fox Reporter, was interviewing one of Corporate Helicopter's Pilots, Peter.  It was a great interview and from this exposure I decided to go to their location and check it out.  Upon arriving I met Jesse, Flight Coordinator, who booked my Valentine Flight.  I was excited that I had an opportunity to pick and reserve a time on Valentine's Day since they are so popular they book up quickly.  Once we arrived we were met by Jesse, and Mandy, Operations Manager, who is so extremely nice and fun to talk to.  Mandy offered us some champagne and handed my wife some roses and then introduced us to Amanda, who gave us a tutorial on our flight.  Amanda then drove us out to the flight deck area via a golf cart and we boarded this very nice Helicopter which is made in Torrance California.  It is a beautiful Helicopter that sits four people counting the Pilot.  Our Pilot turned out to be Peter who was in the interview with Heather.  The flight was smooth quite and our Pilot, Peter, was superb.  We went from Montgomery Field to north of Mt. Soledad, north of Torrey Pines and looped back along the coast at about 1,000 feet.  As we went over the ocean we spotted a California Gray Whale, the water was so clear and the whale was right below us.  The flight hugged the coast line down to Mission Beach over Sea World, then south to San Diego Bay, down to the Coronado Bridge, circle around downtown and over Petco Park and back to Montgomery Field.  It was such a beautiful flight and Peter explained so many things throughout the flight that made the trip that much more interesting.  I highly recommend you take the time to check out Corporate Helicopters and you too will find yourself booking a flight that will leave you with sense of joy and satisfaction and a true thrill.  Very awesome!!!< /Review>

Very professional! flight was amazing, if you have never been in a helo, you need to do this! The flight was very smooth and comfortable. Book a tour asap!!! The helo was very clean, and mechanically perfect, staff and pilot were very friendly. I will be going back to take more tours of the city.</text>

<Review>This is was a surprise for my girlfriend and we did the 30 min tour. The pilot/tour guide was great and the service while scheduling was better than most. If you're debating going, don't. Go for it.</Review><Name>Patrick Jackson<//Name><resp>None< /resp><Date>1429285940550</Date>< pics>

<Review>We had about 10 hours to see San Diego and decided to take a heli-ride to cover the town.  Called Corporate Helicopters and were met with a polite, proffesional and pleasant staff.  Great pilot (Peter), and a fine fine experience, to be recommended!!

Been on a few helicopter rides like this in Vegas, Sturgis, Florida ect. Price was g.ood, about the least expensive, good value. We took the 30 minute tour.

By far the WORST chinese food ever. The food was swimming in soy sauce. Chicken was so old. Nothing fresh. Had to throw it away. A really bad chef. Eewwww. This place ruined chinese food for me for years to come.<//Text>

I like this restaurant! They give superb dishes, they have a nice menu, The chief cook in that spot is very experienced, I like a lot trying all their food. The food is always tasty, the service towards the clients  is agreeable. I often go to  this place and I not even once was unsatisfied. Highly recommended.<//Text>

I have no idea why this place has any bad reviews. As a paramedic, I eat Chinese food out of my ambulance all over Los Angeles. This is in my top three of favorite places, excellent portions, and you can tell it's cooked fresh to order. I always get the egg Foo young. Food is on point.</review>

We've seen this place for years and even lived around the corner for a decade but never tried it until our Eating Ventura project. We loved the orange chicken and spicy garlic chicken. Inexpensive, pleasant, and clean. We'll definitely return!<//text>

We ate at this restaurant before and food was good. Today we've ordered takeouts for 5  and two dishes were just not good. My chicken with vegetables did not have any spices or salt and beef with green peppers had tough beef and totally raw bell peppers.
Called to complain and the lady thanked me for bringing it to her attention. It will be some time before I'll go there</review>

<user_name>Shawn Mays</user_name><Text>ordered delivery. general tsos with egg fried rice and yellowtail and salmon cut rolls. Food was delivered fast and presented decently. Food was disappointing. The sushi was gross - packed with rice, smothered in a weird sauce, fell apart when i picked it up, and couldnt even taste the fish... the chicken and rice was decent, one of the better ive had recently. Overall dont get the sushi but try one of their chicken dishes< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c29eb7c61f82ab:0x593b5f7dee73cad4< /gmap_id><user>109698719659739755994<//user><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Ordered 2 sets of sushi and miso soup for delivery. It took them long enough to delivery  me 2 sets of warm sushi without any side of wasabi or ginger.Moreover they forgot to put a spoon for  my soup and sticks for sushi and no napkins, not a single one! Miso soup was basically a pound of salt dissolved in a hot water. No way I'm ordering any food from this place.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c29eb7c61f82ab:0x593b5f7dee73cad4</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Delivered food, order was incorrect and the food tasted too salty. I called explained, volunteered to drive over, and asked to return dish they told me "no." I've ordered from here several times, but this is my last time. Rude, unprofessional, and the food is average or below average...< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Delivery has now taken a hour and a half.  They just keep saying "On the way" and say 10 more minutes, 45 minutes has now passed since my first call and I have heard "10 more minutes" twice or more now.

Very unorganized, forgot to bring Soy Sauce, food was cold by the time it got to me.  Worst experience ever.  Stay away!< /text>

<review>Ordered for delivery, we have a screenshot saying it would be delivered between 8:50 and 9pm. After being delivered at 9:37pm, the driver "Russ" informed us that after our food was ready to go out for delivery, 2 more orders came in. He waited for the other food to be prepared,  and then delivered our food last. It was cold upon delivery, and Russ had attitude when I asked him why it took so long. If you want cold food and bad attitude, look no further<//review>< pics>

< Review>
I ordered food on friday june 21st. Let me start of by saying that i dont even know how this place is still in business. There food is horrible and on top of everything i had roaches in my food, i had complaint to the owner. Instead of the owner apologizing and guving me a refund, he got very upset and said there was not going to be of any refund at all. I even opened up the food plate and showed him the dead roach amd he still didnt care. I have never been so disgusted in my life, my stomach started hurting and i threw up there at the restaurant. Please help me stop these unproffesional cooks and teach them a lesson.</Review>

First time here and definitely not my last!

I picked up a fish soft taco and the grilled chicken burrito, both "con todo."  They were both so full of flavor, fresh ingredients, the green and red so were bomb too! They didn't make it past the parking lot...< /Text>

We stopped here due to the good reviews, but were blown away by the exceptionally friendly service and deliciousness of the food. The employees checked to make sure everything tasted good. Everything was delicious: I especially loved the homemade chips and the horchata, perfect on a warm day and it came with free refills. It’s rare to find good service these days, so props to the employees for making our stop here a highlight of our trip!</Text>

<Review>Qualification: this review is not based upon the quality of the food as I have yet to taste it, but it is based upon what I witnessed were contradictory application of the Covid procedure.

I specifically came to this location based upon their review rating. Upon arrival, two customers were openly unmasked and a representative was directly speaking to them outside the restaurants protective glass barrier. Note that this was taking place notwithstanding their posted signage mandating that masks be worn. I have recently moved to California from the State of New York where many people I know became sick because of Covid. California is in the worst position of all at this moment and I would have expected much more from this or any establishment seeking to operate in these dangerous and uncertain times. To the business owner, please take this pandemic seriously.

Udate: just finished the Al Pastor tacos. They were excellent! I'll upgrade my review to a 3 star. I would have left a 5 star but for the Covid failure.</Review>< Pictures>

We stopped in searching for some quality tacos and were not disappointed. You can understand why they’ve been here for 11 years. Great food and customer service. Highly recommend! Mad props to Art, Sara, and their crew.< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Was in the area, & I eat tacos often. So I searched Google, came across Taco Grill.. looked at the pics and read some reviews.. it was pretty close so I figured I’d give it a shot.
Wow. Let me tell you, the service was Great, & the food even BETTER! Order came out quick too. It’s pretty hard to impress me when it comes to tacos, because there’s SO many choices out there... but Taco Grill definitely did.
If you’re in the area, or even if your aren’t but you want some quick, GOOD food- give this place a try. For sure.
I will most definitely be returning 👍🏻👍🏻</Text>< pictures>

Always great food when I visit.  Have tried several items and have never been disappointed.  Their hard shell tacos can't be beat.  It feels like you are stopping by to visit family.  The are so nice and friendly.  Highly recommend.<//Text>

< Review>
Tried a few taco places when I started working in the area and wish I had tried taco grill sooner. No comparison. Get a taco of each meet and see if they're each uniquely different and above par compared to other places. Also, salsas are really good.</Review>

<rating>2</rating><Review>Food is delicious, but they need to improve customer service. I order take out. When I got home I noticed they gave me the wrong food. I called to let them know and told them I did not mind going back to get my food as long as I didn't have to wait for it or that my food would be cold. She said it was fine, but that there was no way she was going to make up for the food, no refund or free meal  (not that I was asking for it) and just as I was going to tell her my husband would be picking up the food she hanged up on me. I almost did not go, but what I paid was much more than the mistaken food. Would I go back? Probably not. Will I tell people about it? I would just give them the truth. Taco Grill did nothing to make me happy after they made a major mistake.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

The shredded beef guisado style taco stands out here. The innovation of putting a ropa vieja into a taco is worth the trip if you're not from the area. It reminds me of a cochinita pibil or tinga with its homey and flavorful stewed feel with the added bonus of beef. It's worth getting a few of these. The carne asada also had a slightly beefier flavor — it almost seemed like they added bone marrow or something to it. It's also a big plus.

The proprietor working the cash register also provided an extra amount of service than expected from a taco stand.</text>

Love this place! The quality of the food is top notch and everyone there is so nice. I would've taken a picture of my food but it was too good to even get my phone out. Haha</Review>

<Text>Good place for a fast burrito.  Very nice staff. Grilled chicken burrito tasted good enough to have again.  I am a hard grader.  I grade on my experience and since I've had better and nothing bedazzled me it gets four stars.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< user_id>

<Time>1565549602607</Time><Text>My husband and I discovered this Hidden Secret when we were going to college yeeears ago. We had their tortas and they were to DIE FOR!! Even though we moved a good 40 minutes away we will STILL make the drive if we're jonesing for Tortas packed with flavor! So much that we've STRONGLY persuaded the owners (who are the sweetest!!) to open a location in our area because all the mexican/latin eats over here have little to no taste compared to them. So 12 Stars all day every day!!<//Text><user>103997216520841664382<//user><user_name>Kimberly L<//user_name><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

The place is really nice small and cozy,  Food is really good and affordable, the staff is friendly. But I was a little disappointed when i order the hard taco plate, I expect it to be served with sour cream and queso fresco, and I get it with shredded cheese ??? no a fan of shredded cheese 😕😞🙁<//Review>

Food was delicious and service was friendly and quick.
The carne asada was so good! Juicy and flavorful. The chips were very tasty too.
The mild sauce was very mild, no kick at all, but I really liked the flavor.
Highly recommend< /Text>

Go here.

I ordered the Veggie Tacos. 2 for $4, which comes out to be $2 p/taco, but it was good.  So good that during my second trip to Glendora I order 6 veggie tacos @ $12.  Curious about their hard shell tacos.  But this is a never forget type of place when it comes to strictly veggie tacos which works on those weeks where I need to lay completely off the meat and and especially the sugar.<//Review>

Hey Everyone! This is by far the best place in town for great Mexican food! We frequent this grill a few times a week and have never been disappointed. Reasonably priced. Everything on the menu is superb! Customer service is on point too! Good people! And they promote our schools through SOS(save our schools) and Egood(a percentage of each order is donated to the schools). Try Taco Grill for yourself and you'll be hooked!<//review>

Delicious. Happened upon this little place. I had their carnitas quesadilla and Marie had the veggie burrito. There was only one guy making the food, and it seems like most of it was made fresh as we waited. It was worth the wait. There is not much room to sit, but it's probably the best Mexican food for the price I've had for quite some time.</text>

<Text>First  time visitors to this place,  small eating area, but I believe  the food totally  makes up for it. Most of my family had chicken tortas which were really good,  the flatten bread was something that surprised me, but it actually worked out and thoroughly enjoyed it. My dad had some soft tacos, some were asada and the others were already pastor and he enjoyed his plate as well.  I will be becoming back here for sure if I come back around the area.< /Text>< GmapID>

<Review>I went to this location based on the high reviews but I was highly disappointed. Growing up eating mexican food probably prompts me to have higher expectations when it comes to visiting mexican restaurants.  First of all, this place is not designed for dining in, there are only 2 small tables with little space. My full order consisted of 8 tacos and I had to wait at least 15 minutes (no updates or apologies for the delay) and there were no other customers waiting.
As far as flavor goes, my asada tacos lacked flavor and the "al pastor" were way too greasy to enjoy. Will not be going back.<//Review>< pictures>

The food is not the best and the place, it's somewhat clean. I ordered the Carne asada burrito and I have had better.</Review>

The reviews are true.

WHAT IT IS
A little taco spot, tucked away sort of perpendicular to Spaghetti Eddie's.

WHAT YOU SHOULD ORDER
Tacos (especially the al pasteur and carne asada!)

AMBIANCE
N/A
I'm not deducting points for this, because this really is a takeout spot. Just be aware--this is NOT the sort of place where you can expect to sit down with a large party. There's maybe space for ten people in the entire store, it's that small. It's best to call ahead and order so you can pick up and jet outta there, because it gets crowded on Taco Tuesday.

FOOD AND DRINKS
5 Stars
These are probably the *best* tacos I've had anywhere. The meat is just so flavorful, and I haven't bumped into any nasty problems like tendons in the tacos. I usually get the al pasteur or carne asada, which is tender and delicious. Their nachos, sopes, and taquitos are amazing too!

NICE SURPRISES
TACO TUESDAY.

OVERALL
A real hidden gem for Glendora. This place is just incredible, and it's a shame it's in such a weird spot.< /review>

Love, love, love this store! Been shopping here for years, unfortunately they'll soon be closing their doors for good, which makes so many of us extremely sad!  Hurry in NOW, to grab what you can, at great discounted prices! 😢<//Text>

This was an awesome place to shop and I love taking my wife here.  Every time we go there were greeted with smiles from employees that are eager to help us find what we are looking for. If your lucky enough to be there when Chanda is working she will give you personalized service with the beautiful smile  and eager to help you find exactly what you're looking for.  The employees work together so well there I've never seen anything like it. They are real team players and dress barn is lucky to have them caring for their establishment.  It was another great day watching my wife smile with a handful of close as we walked out of the store thank you for reading my review.<//Text>

<Text>I love their clothes specially the plus sizes. They fit well, feel good and you look awesome because their clothes fit. They didn't just cut it bigger, it's made to fit and styles are up to date. They changed personnel so all of my sweet, helpful and nice ladies are gone but I have to give the new ones a chance...big shoes to fill though.<//Text>< Pics>

I went in to exchange my kevlar and refill my IFAK which was empty and I was in and out in less than 15mins. I recommend you get there around 0800 or earlier.< /Text>

A bunch of disgruntled vets who still wish they were in so they act hard... well some of them and then there is the wanna be hard civilians so they dnt take your cif gear if there is a slight amount of lint or dust, I looked at my cif gear wrong and they didn't take it. But the Asian dude is cool. If you get him you're golden.< /review>

shorter lines. way way shorter. i got seen within 1 hours and all my stuff accepted within 30mins. they can tell who will give them problems. dont give them a hard time and theyll work with you to make it as speedy as possible. dont be stupid and fight or bribe them they are very chill and like all other cif facilities run by prior marines.< /text>

Noodles and sushi were good. Everything is fine. Even fake 50% off still fine. Just didn’t like soy sauce.<//text>

Good service and authentic kimchi & bulgogi.
We weren't greeted by anyone after standing at the entrance for five minutes. The sushi rice is harder than usual and seems dry. The steamed rice too, dry, hard, and starchy. They did mess my order up but fixed it eventually.
The 50% off sounds awesome but the sushi rolls are priced way higher than sushi you get from other places. One of the rolls is $20 for 8 pieces and, after 50% off is $10, which is same/similar as other restaurants. I might try it again in the future, or might not.< /text>

Great food, but the service is exceptional! Our favorite place for sushi. A little difficult getting in and out if parking lot because of Costco gas station. We always use the rear access.</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Today was my first time trying a Sushi Restaurant. I had been out for appointments today and right after I filled up my tank at Costco my Auntie suggested we try it. I am terrified of being out right now due to Covid-19 so this was my first time dining out since our lockdown. I literally hadn't even ordered to-go food for the first 10 months since this pandemic started. I have a compromised immune system so I have been trapped in my home for a year. We ate outside in their enclosed patio and they were very sensitive to my concerns. They ensured we weren't going to be near other diners which was most important. My second favorite thing was the staff wore gloves and masks they had that they kept on their NOSE AND MOUTH the entire time. On top of all of these great things that made my experience incredible THE FOOD WAS GREAT!!!!! THANK YOU ALL< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOj5f1riGYJOdthMJE4_hIfpVLF9q0SihViZHoi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg-_cKf8w1WXU3OAGQ1CEmqPPdcpuu3I1vQojd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtJNyDM26NzzQlUgmL8fvhQWiPrNqSMTGG_3WH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMA3ADxEbGzcIt5spMxMigaYQCjmsLPzM__agEm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgzmBKJZvNvSb4LKgoXkg6Vr75RHzBmzQeRScf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMT80K310gNTJ4Zea0fPLeDASaZBKFjIWnmHU-d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80d9550a9176bec7:0x7eaf6996b0756d10< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I've ordered here multiple times and they always screw something up.
Most of the time they burn the food on one side. Other times they add all veggies which I'm allergic to 1 of them.
Today I did dine in with my wife and they missed my order completely which is ridiculous. I had to ask 3 different employees about my food until I finally said I don't want it and wanted the check.</Text>

<Review>Delicious! I don't know I it's because it's noon on Valentine's Day so they are fully stocked with fresh fish for tonight's "amateur night" but regardless the fish was fresh and amazing. The Sunshine roll was good!!! The ginger peanut sauce on top makes this roll!! Hubby had the pink roll. It was a 4/5. So good but we added crunches on top to give it something crunchy each bite.

Only suggestion is to have asparagus in the rolls. Just me lol. Servers were attentive and nice. We sat at the sushi bar and the chef was nice and easy to communicate with.  I originally thought this was a "teeny bopper" sushi low budget Pb place, but I'm very surprised and I feel bad for judging. I will definitely be coming back. Delicious sushi in Pb that's not a fortune! Awesome!<//Review><Time>1613437770277<//Time>< user>

I asked for no hot peppers or any spice and they made my food with alot of spice. She even repeated the order and it still came out wrong. I had radiation and chemo and they don't mix with any kind of heat especially in your mouth.< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>We are out of town and visited Sushi Kuchi during our vacation. It was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! And the price was right, service was very friendly and fast! We mentioned that we don’t have much time and have to catch our flight back home, they were understanding and so QUICK! Our server was so personal and sweet, seemed like we visited our Japanese friend. Seriously, I was ready to give her a hug🤗 Should I mention their macaroon ice cream?!!! We got mango, and it was out of this world and a perfect ending to our lunch!! ❤️❤️❤️ If you visit soon you may catch their 50% off sushi and rolls sale, and please try mango macaroon ice cream! I wish we lived closer, we would visit every week! Amazing place! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</review>< user_name>

< review>
The restaurant is not bad for what it is. It does cost a bit more than other sushi restaurants that I like. Over the experience was good and even the children like the food so that was a plus! Going there for birthday's it great compared to other restaurants. What I would change is the some of the staff could be a bit nicer as it seemed to be an problem we were there.<//review>

So many yummy choices. The 50% off menu is large and full of options. The food is very fresh. Very friendly staff and clean area. They serve alcohol as well with a very nice range to choose from. One of my go to places.<//text>

Very good sushi for the price. 7 for a great rainbow roll; 8.50 for the Tornado-151, which has like 5 kinds of spicy seafood. Good service. Two TVs.< /text>

<review>I discovered this sushi place a few weeks ago. My family hesitant to try the dine out option but intrigued by . We tried 3 different rolls: the starwars roll, sweet Hawaiian roll, Vegas R. All 3 were phenomenal. My family will definitely be comming back soon.</review>< userid>

love, love, love sushi kuchi! My favorite place to take my friends and family to celebrate anything. I love they sing with hats and play instruments. The price is so cheap, I eat 3 or 4 rolls and don't leave the place broke. The staff is always the same, they know me by my name and I feel so welcome every visit. Their house dressing is the bomb. highly recommend this place<//text>

I had the bento box chicken katsu, sashimi and a baked scallops. The chicken had a “barbecue” sauce which overwhelmed most of the taste, same with the scallops, not bad but it could be less. The real wasabi for the sashimi was great, very strong taste. Overall price was good and no issues on service.<//Text>

Always good food and great service. Positive vibes and a happening environment. Always get the Star Wars roll and something else. Plus,  50% off menu is always a big bonus!< /review>

The sushi is always good, and the half priced ones are pretty decent. I always go there when craving sushi. They also have macaron ice cream sandwiches are heavenly. (Pictured below is the mango one, but they have 4 other flavors)<//Review>

< Review>
I had the bento box chicken katsu, sashimi and a baked scallops. The chicken had a “barbecue” sauce which overwhelmed most of the taste, same with the scallops, not bad but it could be less. The real wasabi for the sashimi was great, very strong taste. Overall price was good and no issues on service.<//Review>

<Review>If you go here, they'll take your temperature with a device pointed at the sun which will then say you have a fever one minute and not the next. We couldn't get it to cooperate with us and our kids at the same time, so after several tries we had to leave while everyone stared at us and assumed we had covid. We used to love this place, but that was a joke. Get a normal thermometer. Or maybe don't face that one towards the sun.< /Review><UserId.>108701003998717547845< /UserId.><time>1593741975171<//time>< Resp>

<text>Great experience every time! It sells itself as a date / couples spot but I'm the jerk that goes there with my wife and 1yr old and it's still a good place to go. The sugar in all the sauces maker it easy for the child to enjoy the food. Not saying everything is too sweet, just that kids can easily enjoy it.</text><Time>1577844577268<//Time>< GmapID>

Our waitress was rude. Gave my mom an attitude when my mom politely asked about her meal. They forgot part of her meal. Our waitress didn’t bother to ask our table if everything was okay, but constantly checked up on the tables around us. Would not come again<//review>

Great service! All the staff were friendly, helpful and gracious! I wasn't rushed through my meal.  The menu is large with lots of great choices.  The food was delicious! Everything had great flavor. The meal was a good value.   The parking was free and there were a sufficient number of spaces.</Text>

i hardly ever write bad reviews but the service was just really really bad on Tuesday night 7/29. it was like pulling teeth tryna get the attention of the servers.

it took a long time for our drink orders to be taken and when they asked about drinks, i told the guy we were ready to order actually since we’ve been waiting but he just walked away- had to wait another long time for order to get taken. he didnt even go over our order, just took our sheet n dipped. we asked for a high chair for my nephew 3x, luckily when we asked the girl who was working, she got stuff over to us quick.

also asked another guy worker for spicy mayo but that never came out.

our miso soups that we put on the sheet never came out either- and we asked for it to be taken out the check.

asked for our check multiple times, and the table near us asked after us and got theirs right away.

our check still had the miso soups that we never got- so i had to remind the waiter to take it off the bill 🙄

overheard other tables telling the server to cancel their drink order since it was never brought out -make sure u check ur bill!!</review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Made a reservation for 7pm and was told if we didn't check in by 7 they would give the table away.  We arrived 15 min early and waited 30 min and we still didn't have a table.  In the 30+ min we waited, they seated at least 5 other groups that came as walk-ins.  We checked with the host stand several times and they kept saying they were waiting for a specific table to clear, but we looked over at that table and that party had not even started eating yet.  Decided to just leave and take our party somewhere else otherwise we would have been seated at least 30 min later.  Was looking forward to trying this place but I've lost interest.  There are plenty of good sushi places in San Diego that actually respect reservation times.<//Review>< pictures>

These are the best donuts in San Diego. The people that work here are really nice, too. The bear claws and the Bavarians are insanely delicious.<//text>

This is by far one of the best sushi places I’ve been to in the United States. I have yet to try a roll that I haven’t loved! It made me feel like I was back in Japan! I also loved the half priced rolls on the back of the menu. Definitely a place I will be going back to the next time I’m in San Diego!<//review>

< Review>
I’ve passed this place many times when going to the CostCo on Fenton Pkwy, but have never tried. My family had a craving for Japanese food and Sushi Kuchi is the closest and open for takeout.

A cute young lady named Min greeted me with enthusiasm and a smile. I can’t recall everything I ordered, but here’re the highlights. Soft shell crab, gyoza, calamari, and shrimp tempura for appetizers. Crispy fish, Hungry roll (I was hungry), Homeless roll (I try to support the homeless), Sensual Pleasure roll (I uhm... Never mind), White Boy roll (For my sisters white boyfriend). Honestly I’m not really a sushi person so I ordered the rolls based on their name.

In short, everything tasted fresh and delicious. There was a steady flow of customers while I waited for my food. Plenty of wasabi, ginger and I asked for low sodium soy sauce which they provided in plenty. I plan to return and highly recommend.< /Review>

Been meaning to try this place for a few years. Ordered some rolls, soup, and a bento lunch for my son. All was very good. Service is friendly. Great sushi and bento lunch spot. Will do over. And parking is a pleasure compared to many other sushi spots in town.<//review>

<review>This place was delicious!  I’ve been craving it since we went a few years ago but since it was a random stop while we were driving I thought I’d lost it forever.  Thanks to a google memory that popped up in my images I was able to view the coordinates and found the restaurant.  Definitely try the roll wrapped in cucumber.  I’ve tried to get other places to make it but it never tastes right.  I look forward to eating here again.<//review>< Pictures>

Delicious sushi with super fast service!  This is a great place for good quality, low-budget sushi. Most rolls are 50% off. Great place for dinner with friends or family. You must arrive early, as the dinner rush between six and eight gets pretty hectic.< /review>

My husband and I just left hungry and dissatisfied with there service. We seated ourselves outside, and waiting 25 minutes before the waiter asked for our order. Upset about the customer service we told them we just wanted to pay for the lemonade and leave! Don’t go here if you’re hungry because they take FOREVER to take and bring orders out!<//Review>

Fantastic new-age style sushi. With there 24/7 50% off sushi roll menu, they're pretty much unbeatable. They aren't the most authentic sushi joint but that's not why you go there. Whether its a sake bomb birthday party (which they make sure you enjoy with crazy antics) or a late night sushi grind, you'll never be disappointed here... especially at that price!< /review>

Sat at sushi bar. Service was very good. Did not get green stuff and ginger with my sushi. I had to ask for it. It came quickly. Maybe no one wants it anymore. Rolls were light on tuna and loosely rolled. Bulgogi was excellent. I will be back but not on my regular rotation. Also Sapporo on draft.< /review>

<review>I highly recomend Sushi Kuchi...the ingridients and prep of the variety of items in the menu are outstanding in flavor and texture, waitstaff was on point as far as recomending their favorite sushi rolls.
I had a tuna & scallop roll...It was mouthwatering delicious and the hot green tea..just plain phenomenal experience....Welcome my dear friends and travelers to sunny San Diego...Thank you for viewing...D Third Eye< /review><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

Great prices for lots of delicious food. Their lunch specials are phenomenal and I almost always have leftovers to enjoy for my next meal. All of their sushi rolls are to die for and most of them are 50% if you are there before dinner. The staff are always very friendly and accommodating, especially if you have allergies or want extra sauce. This has been my favorite go to date spot since I found it. Absolutely top ten sushi or bento spots in San Diego.</Text>

Great sushi for a great price, service can be a bit off at times. Do you order from the chef at the sushi bar? The waitress? The random employee who walked by asking if I need anything else to eat? After you've put your initial order in getting anything else can feel confusing.

Also 2 people (I assume a manager and worker) were arguing very loudly and intensely in plain view of all customers. Take it to the back guys...< /review>

I'm not sure if the old Asian lady is the owner but she definitely acts like she owns a place, just pray that they don't make a mistake because it's definitely not their fault, if they do. I guess they must implement the customer is always wrong rule in this case which is unfortunate because the food and the pricing is good but what really matters is the overall experience and to know that you would be treated well. I don't really write reviews unless somebody really goes out of the way to make a great impression and almost never write a bad one unless the experience was horrific and believe me it takes a lot. I can't deny that the food and the pricing is good but if you do order carryout make sure to double triple check that your order is correct because the customer is always wrong rule will be enforced.</Review>< GmapID>

Always love the sushi here, a large hot sake , and beer on draft. Nice after a Costco, Ikea, or a Lowe's run. Those can always be stressful going in and out of lol.< /Review>

Great sushi.  Quick service.  Prices are excellent and very competitive for San Diego.  Staff is friendly.  The birthday celebration is entertaining.  Nice outdoor patio.  Check 'em out.< /Text>

Love this place. Been here 5 times now and the food and service is great.  I go with the Star Wars roll and Crunch Shrimp roll. Price is good at lots of 50% off items.  Very friendly staff and sometimes give you free samples to try. I'll be back many more times.< /Text>

Come to find out we waited 45 minutes, received horrible service, AND they still got my order wrong. They left out $8 worth of food. Now let’s get on the food I did receive. If you enjoy REAL sushi, you will hate this place. They use pickled jalapeños in my poppers.... like who does that at a sushi place? They make cheap over priced food (to say its over priced based off quality is astonishing since their prices are considered low) to earn maximum compensation and they only make “trendy” food for kids who don’t know what quality sushi even taste like. And this is coming from a 21 year old. TRUST ME, spend your money on quality and spare yourself the disaster by coming to this place.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80d9550a9176bec7:0x7eaf6996b0756d10<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Fresh sushi that is reasonably priced and quick to come from the sushi bar. The decor is a little interesting, every time I come here I'm constantly staring at the giant lips behind the sushi bar and questioning the thought process of slapping that up there. Oh well, I digress, keep up the great and fresh sushi!</Review>

This is our favorite sushi place to go to in San Diego. They have big sushi rolls for a decent price. Most places are charging you $13 for the smallest roll possible. The only negative I have about this place is the service is hit-or-miss. Sometimes we have 3 servers who are constantly checking on us or we have 3 servers who all forgot about us.< /text>

Delicious, delicious, delicious sushi. Fun vibe. The waiters all wear black shirts with white lettering on the back that says 'See you tomorrow.' How could you not love that presumption??? : P Beautiful spot with indoor and outdoor seating. We did outdoor and it was lovely. Dessert was not so spot on, but everything else was sweet. ;  )<//Review>

I went recently for date night with the hubby. Seemed busy but we got a table right away.   The waiters give your space when ordering and  eating which I found to be enjoyable.  The food was delicious! I got the bulgogi and my husband had the yakisoba. We also got rolls.  Were very filling and tasty. The bill wasnt that expensive for the amount of food we got . I reccomend coming in.  Very lax atmosphere but it can be loud .</review>

<review>I would suggest that you find a better place. I mean if you are on a budget this may be a great place for you as they have a 50% off rolls menu. Seemed like young people there on dates. I could see why. Cheap. I have never seen pickled jalapeños in sushi rolls. I would think they would mention that on the menu. It literally takes over the taste of the whole roll. So basically your barely getting what you paid for. I will not be going back. Ever</review></record></dataset><record>

They have an awesome menu especially when its 50% off! They were friendly even though we came in about 30 mins before closing. They got our food out quickly and we were impressed. Imagine if we came at a time when everyone wasn't trying to rush and get off work already.  I know the feeling and was very satisfied.<//Review>

<Review>Overall wasnt too impressed. There are better sushi spots in San Diego. The rolls were all similar IMO, none of the food seemed that fresh. It was all kind of wet too, like soggy seaweed and wet fish sort of thing. So far I am not sick, the prices were very reasonable, and I did have a decent, filling meal of the Hot Night Roll and Alaskan Roll with a Miso Soup. Guess if it was really bad I would have rated less stars. Customer service was nice - that's a plus I suppose.<//Review><Response>None< /Response><Pics>None</Pics>< Rate>

<Text>I love me some sushi kuchi, one of my favorite sushi spots in San Diego, plenty of parking too. I been here about 4 times and never a disappointment to be honest. Im a very picky eater and this place is legit and know how to make great tasting sushi and quality ingredients. Great for family, friends or a date. Any occasion would be great here. Give this place a try and tell everyone you had some suchi from sushi kuchi<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

We loved their sushi! The staff seemed scatterbrained, though, and we had to remind them several times that we were there, had our order finished (wound up hand-delivering our order sheet to our waitress, who wasn't really coming to our table at all), AND THEN had to ask for the rolls they didn't bring us before they tried to give us a check. It was a real headache, but honestly we had a big party and I'm sure it was confusing... the sushi was awesome tho so you should at least try it.<//Review>

Service here is very bad. The waitress never came to give out menus, let alone inform my family and I about how the menu works. While we ate, nobody came out to check if we needed water or even to check how things are going. Lastly, I asked to speak to a manager and the waitress left and came back to inform us that the manager was out of the country! To say the least my first experience here is indefinitely my last.<//Text>

<review>Waiter spilled piping hot miso over my wife's lap. Later we had to call him for refills as he never came back to check on us. He acted surprised when ringing me, when told him I wasn't paying for my wife's meal. The only reason why I give it a two star is because the food itself was not bad. Needless to say I'm not coming back.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>This place is awesome. They have great happy hour prices on sushi rolls and the star wars roll is to die for if you like spicey! The service is friendly and fast and that's why I've made this my Sunday Sushi weekly spot.<//Review>< pics>

Great location and decor.  Comfortable chairs and a nice patio for sunny days.  The staff were really friendly, prompt and respectful.  We took our time and enjoyed a long, relaxed meal and were not rushed.  The food was great.  All in all, a great experience.</Text>

My first time here, they got the order wrong but acted like it was my fault, then they brought water instead of a refill of soda and again acted made at us for the mistake.  The 50% off was a good deal but you also got 50%off the food qaulity, looked like a child made it.</text>

I have a hard time reviewing Sushi kuchi because the food was very tasty and well done but the service left a lot to be desired. I came in at around 4 in the afternoon and there were only 3 other tables occupied. Despite this, three separate servers came and asked for our drink order and it still took over 10 mins to just get our waters.
After that we had to flag them down to just take our food order. The food also seemed to take longer than it should have and longer than the other few tables so I'm not sure if it was all placed in right away.
After the food was arriving my mother had to ask 3 separate times for extra Sriracha before some was brought to our table. Overall, the food was good and I had no complaints about the food itself but the service made it a much worse experience than it should have been considering the prices and the quality of the food.<//review>

Food was good but the service was absolutely terrible. Had to ask for our rolls multiple times and water refills multiple times before we ever got them. Then they added extra rolls to our order and we had to make them fix our bill. Would not eat there again.<//Review>

One of our favorite places to go, Great service and prices. Ray runs a tight ship and I like it!! However we just left there and this is the first time out of 50+ that the service was not very good at all, the kitchen had one cook so, we never got our beto box for my son. The sushi was really good though.<//Text>

Delicious sushi and excellent service. I was genuinely shocked at the lunch bill...I thought the prices were marked half off already on the form, but they ended up being rolls for under five dollars each. Great casual environment.</text>

<Text>Food is good, but service is horrible.  Server never checked on us, didn't say more than 2 words to us and we waited 40 minutes to get a couple of sushi rolls.  Waited another 30 minutes to get the 3rd roll, even though they were ordered at the same time.  Waited 20 minutes for the server to come back because we were still hungry, gave up, and I went inside to pay the bill.  I have never left a restaurant hungry before.  Not going back, ever.< /Text>< pictures>

First time I went there I was left alone for like 20 mins after my meal and I had to physically walk to someone to ask for my check. They don’t have assigned waiter/waitresses. I just decided to give it a second try and went there for dinner, and guess what, a waitress gave my card (after paying) to a different customer! I mean, I’ve never ever had this happened at any restaurant across the U.S. The food itself is mediocre and does not make up for the lack of professionalism.</text>< Gmap_id>

Best gym I've ever been to. The club manager always makes sure towels are avaliable. The weights vary in sizes. There are numerous cardiovascular machines, and the sushi is good.</Text>

The waitress was very rude, she asked me to talk to the sushi man, who was also rude, basically yelling at me saying that I was wrong about my order.
Very unpleasant situation!!!
In my experience, they should’ve tried to fix the situation with their consumer, not make me fell uncomfortable yelling at me in the middle of the restaurant when everybody else was staring.
The sad part of it all, is that I used to come to this place every week with my husband. Am I coming back? Nope!<//Text>< pics>

One of my favorite sushi spots in San Diego. Large "sake bomb" is my go-to for a drink, and all of their rolls are priced right and delicious.< /review>

I've driven past this place many times but for some reason never stopped in, I've been missing out!  The service was fast and friendly and the sushi was great!  I especially enjoyed the hungry roll which has popcorn lobster on top and the superman burrito.  Looking forward to trying more of their rolls!<//Text>

Not a bad restaurant if you have nothing to eat around that area other than MacDonalds. Music of Happy birthday greeting in the restaurant was too loud and a nuisance to patrons. For less than a hundred of patrons in the restaurant, it happened three times in an hour. It was obvious that the restaurant chiefs, from their facial expressions, did not enjoy such greetings at all. Just like other restaurant, free WiFi was not available in September 2018.<//review>

<review>Leslie the waitress was so rude. We asked for a cup of water 4 times. Then at the end she wasnt even looking to me. I asked another guy to give us water and while we were leaving, our water came. We go this place a lot but as long as they keep this kind of employees, we are not be coming back.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Substandard sushi. Mediocre to bad service. The teriyaki salmon bento box is the best thing I've had on the menu.</text>

I ordered two of the cheaper rolls "California" and "avocado", even though they were cheap and didn't taste bad, I felt it was not worth it, food was rushed, very small and looked bad aesthetically, other rolls and food friends ordered looked good where bigger and tasted good<//text>

This restaurant denied service to myself and my service animal. They refused to look at my license and the manager on duty sent a waitress to talk to me intead of speaking to me himself. I will be reporting then to the ADA and boycotting this establishment.< /Text>
