This place is one of the barbershops that ACTUALLY follows the rules! I've been to a few barbershops now that COMPLETELY disregard the CDC guidelines. But here I honestly feel safe. Don't risk your life and others lives. Come here. Oh and of course my haircut came out clean 👌🏾< /Text>

Sure it's a good service and professional barbers helping you out with your haircut and shaves. There's a restroom, vending machine, Books, Hair Products and Merch from the shop. I'd highly recommend for you to make an appointment cause if you're walking in for sure you're gonna wait a couple minutes. Haircut was super good 🙏🏽🔥< /text>

I have been getting my haircut at Downey Barbershop for the past two years. I can say i have has the best experience here. I get my haircut with David he is very professional and a perfectionist. He takes his time and makes sure he puts his best work on his client. He blives his work defines him so he won’t finish until he’s satisfied. I recommend him (if he has an opening).</text>

<text>Needed to get a haircut and thought this place would be good because of the reviews, man was I wrong. At first it started off well but then David (the barber) cut all my hair off the top after showing him a picture of how I wanted it cut. The way he cut it was nowhere close how I wanted it cut. Maybe the other barbers are good but wouldn’t recommend this guy.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>All the barbers here have great skills. I've tried them all and have not went home unhappy.. walk ins are a bit less in cost but be prepared to wait as this place is popular. They do accept appointments for a bit more in cost, but well worth the walk in walk out without waiting treatment.< /Review>< Pics>

About 2 year's ago I was looking for a new place to get my hair cut because the place I been going was to far to go. So I Google some places and by far this was the best place its close to home and the prices are great. I can't complain. So if you are looking for a barber shop this is the place to go.< /Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Came to this place twice first time got lucky and got seen right away. But I've read reviews where people say  that they mostly operate by appointment only. So today I came in for the second time but and and I walked in only saw 2 guys getting haircuts and a few other people just hanging out so I thought I got lucky. I was asked if I had an appointment and I said no. So the guy rolled is eyes and some lady holding a broom asks me if I'm looking for a haircut I said yes and then she said well unfortunately there wasn't anyone available until after 7 pm. I walked in at 415 pm. So I found this shocking since there was no one else waiting at all but oh well. Lesson learned. Won't come back to this place, thought I found a new barbershop I would like since I just moved to this city. Nope.< /text>< Pictures>

Soooo slow with drive ups. I did drive ups for a different location and had orders done within 15 minutes. 2 jars of baby food shouldn’t take 2 hours to get.</Review>

<Review>Hello all i just want to give a shout out to a special employee at this target location. Marilyn a checker is a wonderful understanding person. We took my 84 yr old mother in to this target and let her go crazy buying  anything her little heart desired. Well we went to marilyns check stand  and she was so helpful. She went out of her way to help us . My koodoos to her . In my opinion you should have more employees like her. I will be back. Because of how friendly and comfortable we felt.... thanks marilyn at the  target in rocklin calif. Thank you< /Review></record>

< review>
I can say that I love this Pharmacy simply because of the people that work there. It's been a long time since I have had a pharmacy that actually would communicate and treat me with respect genuinely concerned for their customers. I've been super disappointed with CVS since they took over Long's quite a few years ago now but you can switch my prescriptions to the CVS there at Target I've been very very happy.< /review>

<time>1609022226276<//time><Rate>1</Rate><Review>So my step mom had bought the black ops cold war ultimate edition card for my husband for Christmas to download to his Xbox, she was not informed by the cashier to keep the receipt with the activation code on it nor did she know prior. We just went into target to ask if there was anything they can do if they could pull up the original receipt with the code on it or give a refund so we can go re-purchase the card. They then responded that there was nothing they could do, I then asked so she is basically out of $90? To which they replied without any sympathy Yep pretty much. We called gift card services to which their response was pretty much the same although they are going to try and get in contact with Microsoft to get the code however they were not certain that they could even get the code. Now my stepmom is out almost $100 and now we have to re-purchase the game possibly for another hundred dollars.  This was not great customer service which they say they “strive” to give.  This experience changed my view about target< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Absolutley disgusted by the amount of people not wearing masks, over a dozen people. I asked two of the people and they refused and went their way shopping. It was a very unpleasent experience, i asked staff about it and she seemed equally upset about it. The staff member led me to a manager who was very polite but made it seem like there was nothing they could do. Very dissapointed in target, seems like they dont care about the people who wish to be safe amist this pandemic.</text>

<Text>Very nice Target, plenty of parking, not too crowded, problem for me is that too many guests are not wearing face coverings. It is a state mandate even if not yet a Target nationwide policy and I don't expect $15 per hour workers to enforce state mandates but I also have alternatives so I'll shop online and in other stores for now.</Text><Gmap_id>0x809b1f101bce1fb9:0x8dcb66e2709573af<//Gmap_id>< rate>

<Review>I know how irritating customers can get especially when they ask the same question again and again. I was having issues and I probably called customer service five or six times. Julia S answered the call every time and was very kind, generous and helpful. She did not hesitate to help me and answered all my questions regardless of how many times I called. Thank you for the great service!</Review>< pictures>

The store manager Lei. She made our visit the best one I have ever had. Her attitude towards customers was exemplary, kind, and caring. After my return was done and I was so very happy with her service, we continued to shop. When it was time to check-out the lines were long. She came over to some of us who were last in line and took my Mother and I to the self check out and helped my Mother pay for her things. Above and beyond! The entire shopping experience was made better by Lei helping us without our even asking. I will always return to this Target location.</Text>

<Review>I love online order store pick up BUT your system uses a plastic bag that can't be reused. I bring my own bags and the staff says even after removing the barcoded sticker that they can't reuse the bag. that is ridiculous. Walmart uses a system with no bag just a barcode sticker ditto for grocery order pick ups where bags are optional. WALMART is more green than Target?!?!</Review>< Pics>

Clean store but the grocery dept is awful, lots of out of stocks. Store management should be ashamed of themselves because they are losing business.</Text>

This Target location is notably larger than the one in Roseville.  The place is well kept and organized, the staff friendly and accommodating , and there is ample parking space.  There is also a Starbuck's in the store with a few tables if you wish to have some coffee and snacks.< /Review>

Quick response to a leaking faucet.
Came out the same day with fast and courteous service. Was upfront about the issue and it was quickly resolved for more than a reasonable price.</Text>

<text>I woke up Sunday morning to a broken irrigation pipe which resulted in having no water at all. I had to find someone who was open on Sunday and available ASAP, and I decided to call this company because I liked what other customers said about their work. I am glad I called. The receptionist was very friendly and sent someone over within thirty minutes. Larry was knowledgeable and straight to the point. He pointed out the issues, the causes that lead to the break, and what he could do to fix it. More importantly, I didn't feel like he was trying to upsell me on anything, which is something I am very cautious about as a customer. There was no pressure to buy anything at all. He spent some time to put together a few proposals and laid them all out. He explained clearly why he was proposing certain fixes in addition to the necessary repairs. Maybe I could have shopped around for lower prices from different companies, but I liked what he said about the quality of their work, which I did not want to settle for when it came to housing repairs like plumbing. He was extremely patient with my questioning, which I appreciated because I like to ask a lot of questions. Overall, I am very happy with the work they did, and they will be the first company I call for plumbing services.</text>< Resp>

<Review>I have had the pleasure of using this businesses services twice so far. From reps Larry and John. Both were amazing. They were knowledgeable, fair, and overall trade professionals. I would highly recommend this company based on their awesome employees, extremely fair prices (i shopped around a lot) and the dispatchers willingness to help us get the jobs done as fast as possible. I will definitely be a returning customer when repairs are needed.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1600542822360, 'text': 'Thank you BM for the kind words.

<Text>The guy was quick noticed I had a faucet that they don't usually recommend. He wasn't able to find a leak so he recommended a new faucet.. Very pricey. To replace the faucet it was $605. I could've done it myself. They have set prices and no breakdown..So you don't know what your paying for. I guess faucet was 125 and labor the rest. Don't get me wrong. They were nice just pricey<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x809ad933627f8ad7:0x359af63b82a8812c</gmapID></record>

I had a leaking toilet that needed to be repaired, and it's always a risk to pick a new service provider, especially a plumber.  I am delighted with the service I received from America's Plumbing Co.  Courteous, responsive, professional, prompt, communicative.  I will definitely call them again if I have a future need for a plumber.  I highly recommend them.< /Text>

<Text>John G. Edwards was the tech plumber that fixed my pipes.  He was absolutely top notch.  I was given a phone consultation and a very thorough detailed email consultation immediately.  I was sure I had to choose American Plumbing for how professional and quickly they gave me my estimate and how many photos with explanations of the work needed to be done.  Then after work was finished they took photos and details of the work. Not only did they come quickly to give the estimate but also came out quickly to do the work. I gotten 3 estimates, they were the most thorough, quickest, and most competitive.  I highly recommend them<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x809ad933627f8ad7:0x359af63b82a8812c< /Gmap_id></record>

America's Plumbing charges by the job, not by the hour,  and before the work begins you are asked to approve an estimate. If you're okay with the estimate, that's what you pay.  It's all above board, and there's no padding the job.

The company responded immediately, the tech arrived promptly, and he was clearly efficient.We had a lot of work done, and the man who did it was careful and competent, and everything was clean when he left.

This is a prompt, honest, competent company.  There's not much else you can ask for when hiring a contractor.

Ask for Leonard Peterson if you can get him.

Not many reviews for this plumbing company "But" more than others I found through doing a Google Maps search for a "Plumber near me". I don't flippantly give reviews for companies unless I feel they measure up to past reviews. They have a high rating because of how they do business. They are without question desevering in my opinion of a "5 Star" rating. I called late in the afternoon before my next day appointment that was scheduled for between 12pm & 3pm. The plumbing technician called me at 11am & asked if I would like an earlier time of 11:30am instead, which really helped out my day of getting other things done on my list. He arrived promptly @ 11:25am. When he had assessed the problem in a short time, I explained that I was on a budget & did not want anything extra done than what was not absolutely needed to get me back on track. I appreciate that he did not try to give me a sales pitch to replace some of the pipes under the house. The work I had done was a very badly clogged drainage problem in the shower. He completed the work in a timely manner & was impressed by his experience with the work he did. Thank you "John Moore" & kudos for a job well done! Would not hesitate to call these folks out again for service. Thank you America's Plumbing Company for a doing a great job! Happy Camper here...  : )<//text>

The technician came to the house and he investigate the problem in less than 2 minutes then he was confident the problem in the garage, he gave me the estimation coast to solve this problem and I accepted it, after 2 hours of working he said oh it seems the problem from another place and I guess it's in the Kitchen! in this case who is responsible to the wrong investigation? I know you work around 2 hours attempting to solve the issue but this is not my problem. At the end I paid the full amount for the service and the problem STILL going on, they should have clear policy for example they should say if we are unable to solve your issue then we will charge you 50% of the agreed cost but they took 100% for attempting and the problem not solved<//review>

The plumber was able to unclog our emergency plumbing issue but he broke the tile in the bathroom when putting the toilet back, complained when toilet itself started leaking after he put it back ( was not the original issue and it never leaked in the past and now makes a constant tricking noise) , chipped the laminate outside the bathroom door with all his gear.. and then asked for extra  compensationfor fixing the toilet leak that was never there to begin with. Now,  I've never had a plumbing problem in the past so I don't know what to compare this to, but all in all...I wasn't thrilled with this service other than my main sewer line in no longer backed up.

Update! The owner called me after reading my review and was very gracious and determined to rectify the situation. He is clearly very serious about the quality of his business and team and I feel better about the company after speaking with him. I appreciate his efforts to make this better and I would give this company another chance to handle my plumbing needs should one arise in the future. But let's hope that doesn't happen...< /text>

<name>Mike Riley<//name><Date>1526272542682</Date><Rating>1</Rating><text>They were sent out to my house by my home warranty provider. I already had the drywall down for easy access to the pipe. He told us he was going to recommend a full repipe of my home. A week later I had heard nothing from the plumbing company or my home warranty people. I called up my people who told me they were still waiting to hear from the man that came to my home. Keep in mind all this time I was without cold water. Again I called 3 days after I called the first time with still no word, where at that time I was informed that the plumber who came to my house was not returning their calls, so my water pipe continued to leak slowly over this whole time frame Screw this company, I spent 2 good full days learning how to sweat copper and what fittings to use and where to use them. Did the damn job myself. I will NEVER, call on this company again, and that is a shame because a damn good friend of mine worked for these guys for years and highly recommended them.<//text>< pictures>

<Response>{'time': 1526315564509, 'text': 'Mr. Riley,\n\nWe appreciate your feedback. In our attempt to improve our internal communication process we searched all records of all "Mike Riley\'s" and were not successful in finding any such name. We also contacted the only home warranty company we do business with and they have no record of a "Mike Riley" in the greater Sacramento region. We have been mistaken for another company which goes by American Plumbing. If you are sure it was America\'s Plumbing Co. we would sincerely appreciate a call at (916)488-2300. Please ask for Mike Allison.'}<//Response><Gmap_id>0x809ad933627f8ad7:0x359af63b82a8812c< /Gmap_id></record>

We had this company snake our sink in September 2016 and required another same service in December 2016 and they charged extraordinary amount of money for 9 days over the 90 days written warranty. They are really greedy and interested in getting your money immediately than concern for their customer complaint. I would not recommend anyone to use this company.< /Review>

<Text>I had replaced my water heater with another plumbing company which resulted in no hot water . A quick rinse was it . I called my original company  and ask them if they could come by sometime when they are in the area but after two months of waiting I called them , they told me they lost my number. The second attempt to have them back out was a no-show . I just don’t think they knew how to fix my problem.
I was extremely frustrated when I called America’s plumbing and made an appointment with Dave Hill .  I had been dismissed for so long .But to my surprise he walked in , told me he knew what the problem was and fixed it . Had the parts on him . Dave Hill knew by the information that I gave the appointment setter  . The company was on time ,  professional, knowledgeable and although I didn’t have an Opportunity to price check not knowing what the problem was I do feel the pricing was fair.
Good honest work can be hard to find these days and I  applaud America’s plumbing company for being just that .
Thank You and Dave Hill<//Text>< GmapID>

The free estimate was not so free. Paid 165 to be told a sprinkler joint was broken. They didn't have the part. We ended up fixing it. The scheduler however was friendly so I give it a two stars.<//Text>

< review>
Truck driver review. The first guy I interacted with (I think the dock manager) was very rude. Everyone else was friendly enough. But this place is a cluster. Look at it from google satellite view and imagine 10 trucks all packed in there, only 2 in a dock the rest “staged” for unloading. Impossible to not be in the way and impossible to finally get to your assigned dock (hours after your appointment) without making everybody shuffle around. Would not recommend. Too small of a facility for the amount of trucks they receive, not enough unloaders, etc.< /review>

(Translated by Google) It is difficult to access because there are many carts in the entrance. Carts must be selected in the middle of a parking lot or at a designated location.

(Translated by Google) Very bad service ... the carts to put the merchandise, 90% in very poor condition, also in my particular case I have been 3 months trying to solve the collection of taxes that have been doing to me from the year 2016 to the date October 2017 And the only answer is that they can't do anything, that the authorization to fix those details comes from New York. I spoke to New York and only one machine answers ... I wrote an email and I continued waiting ... until today, neither here in Los Angeles nor in New York they solve me ... I will keep you informed so they know what they can wait if you are in a similar situation to mine .. See you soon

(Original)
Muy mal servicio... los carritos para poner la mercancia, un 90% en muy malas condiciones, ademas en mi caso particular llevo 3 meses tratando de solucionar el cobro de taxes que me han estado haciendo desde el ano 2016 hasta la fecha octubre 2017 y la unica respuesta es que ellos no pueden hacer nada, que la autorizacion para arreglar esos detalles viene de New York. hable a New York y solamente contesta una maquina..escribi un correo electronico y continuo a la espera...hasta hoy ni aqui en los Angeles y tampoco en new york me resuelven.... los mantendre informados para que sepan lo que pueden esperar si estan en una situacion similar a la mia..

First time visiting. Got a ham kids sandwich which included a cookie and applesauce, half turkey and half bbq chicken. All fresh ingredients. Very friendly staff. Nice lunch, not bad for under $20 bucks at all and they gave us each a cookie too! Will definitely be back again...</Text>

<Review>When the people ahead of me tried to pay with thier card suddenly the system was down. She gave them thier 25 order for free since the sandwiches were made. My sandwich  was also made but she told me I had to go to the bank at the end of the strip mall and get cash to pay for my sandwich. I told her I wasn't going to go payb5 bank fees for a 10 sandwich unless they were going to deduct that from the price of my sandwich. She stated she could not do that. I told her then she might as well eat it herself. I will never dine here again.</Review>< rating>

I love mr. Pickles but this girl always had a sour look on her face and my sandwich was sloppy. Really disappointing. Not coming to this one again< /Review>

<text>If I could rate this place 0 stars then I would! the lady who did my sandwich today  was clearly not in the mood and was upset. Very rude staff and didn’t even make the sandwich how I wanted it especially since I’m paying 10+ for a sandwich.  I won’t be coming back here again.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I took my brother for lunch today just moved to manteca, ivd been to other locations and PICKED IT OVER TOGOS I asked for a Turkey ham provolone NO ONIONS! I'm allergic, we took our lunch which paying 10+ $ for a sandwich the way I asked for it. NOT at all it had a few pieces of turkey lettuce (RED ONION!!) no cheese no ham, felt like I got ripped off! 🤔😖 I called them just to here how well give me your name a discount NEXT TIME??!! I feel they owe me a GOOD SANDWICH like I ordered. VERY DISAPPOINTED!</text>

If I could give this place a 0 star I would. Drove across town with my family of 4 to find out they closed early because they ran out of bread!! I got here at 5:30 the doors where locked. I figured they were locked due to COVID-19. (Which they have no signs posted in there windows) so I called and I asked if I could place an order. Oh I’m sorry we closed early because we ran out of bread. 3 other cars pulled up to find out the same thing.<//Review>

I love their sandwiches but it seems they have no real hours. I just called at 5:15 I ask to make an order  her response was well we were slow so we are closing early?No way to run a business and I understand with this virus nothing is set in stone  I hope when you open back up your hours are better.<//text>

<Review>If you are looking for a good cheap sandwich.... This isn't it. Just kinda underwhelming and bland. Nothing special. Why is it called my pickle if that don't give out pickles. They give you cookies on the side. And my cookies were hard and old.<//Review>< Pictures>

Just today, I went in to pick up an online order on my way my home from work my fiance put in. I asked them if he had bought chips and the woman said no, have a good day, and I left. We just sat down to eat 2 hours later and yes, he did buy chips. My reciept wasn't in the bag, but he pulled up the confirmation email and he paid for chips. That's $4 down the drain. Definitely going to question them from now on.</review><resp>None<//resp>< username>

It's too bad the parking lot is a mad house at lunchtime. Security guards for the other shops will stop you from parking if you are not shopping there. Other drivers could care less if you just saved their life, they will cut you off in a heartbeat!!!< /Text>< pics>

<text>Today was my first experience with Mr. Pickles anywhere and we were  in Manteca Calif.  and I was quite surprised a definite noche up from subway or Togo’s.  First I was able to have my sandwich on bread choice or rolls and I chose marbled Rye which was so fluffy and fresh.  We live near the Castro Valley one and have never stopped but gone by it so today out of town we tried one I can not recommend it any higher than I am you too will be surprised like us.  Service excellent and the freshest sandwich I have had in a long time and The Tuna was excellent.</text>< resp>

I love this place. If I could I'd eat here once a day. I have yet to get a sandwich I didn't like. My favorite sandwiches are tuna and pastrami. Just to let you know I don't eat everybody's tuna but their is real good, and talking about good pastrami.  Their's is the best I've had. Other places I would name has too much fat and not enough meat.

Flavorless, the only thing that stood out was the bell pepper. I asked for garlic sauce and mustard didn’t have either on my sandwich. Unfortunately I got it to go. For a sandwich shop named Mr. Pickles I would have expected more than two on my sandwich.</text>

<text>Has very friendly employees and quick service.  Was in there when a rude lady stared complaining  about call in an order 5 minutes before closing.  She was so nasty to the young employees I wanted to put my fist in her mouth to shut her up.  When she came in she expected 6 free sandwiches.  I would he told the to go to subway and would have given her $20.00 just to leave.  Customer service isn't an easy job.  I pray that the lady comes back reincarnated as a mouse and she gets snagged on a glue trap.</text><Resp>None</Resp><Time>1496947029571< /Time><gmap_id>0x8090419fdc1ad931:0x7087362df389d767</gmap_id>< Rate>

This Church has kept its doors opened to parishioners all throughout this difficult time. They are open for confessions TU & TH 6:30-7:30 PM and Saturdays from 3-4PM. All while observing Social distancing guidelines.< /Text>

Lovely place. Very clean. A few complaints though. Avoid it when school gets out. Make sure to go around the stop sign on military. A lot of impatient parents blow through it 2-3 cars at once. There have been a handful of accidents during the school rush hour. The installation of the new stop sign didn't help this problem. Also, parents clog all of the parking spaces in the surrounding neighborhood blocks.</review>

<review>@ Matthew L: the Catholic Church is not "anti-gay" as you say. I encourage you to look at the true teachings of the Church, not what you hear from others. The Catechism of The Catholic Church is a good start. Christ Loves all of us where we are YES, "warts and all" as you say, BUT He does not want us to remain there! He wants us to be "partakers of the Divine Nature", His very Life and Love. "Being gay" is not a sin. Engaging in homosexual acts is a sin. Christ calls all who are not joined in Holy Matrimony, to remain chaste. The one flesh union is for one man and one woman, joined in Holy Matrimony. The teachings of the Church on marriage are difficult, but can best be understood when we reflect on St. Paul's teaching in Ephesians 5, that is that Marriage is a sign of Christ's Love for His Church. May God be with you.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Cool vibe barbershop and everyone is friendly.
Jeremy is an awesome barber and always does an excellent job cutting my hair.
I’ve been to numerous other places to have my hair cut and they have never met my expectations. After my first haircut at traditions I knew I would always be coming back not only because of the great service but to also help support a small business.<//review>

<review>I have been coming to Traditions Hair Company for about 4 years now, so if your going to take a review seriously, consider this one. Ever since the first day I came here, every staff member has always been welcoming. I'm always greeted when I walk in, and there is usually some nice music playing. I've been to every barber in the area, and trust me, this is the best one around here. You won't go wrong with any barber here, they seem to all have perfected their craft. However, it does tend to get pretty busy here, so I would recommend booking online at their website. My barber is alex, but again, you won't go wrong with anyone here.</review>< pics>

I used to go to traditions regularly. All barbers consistently give a good cut. The last time I went, i made an appointment for 2pm. At 1:58pm, I called and said, I am running 2 mins behind. The person answering the phone said, "You are going to I have to wait. He already has someone on the chair." I entered at 2:04pm and he had already been cutting another customer's hair for a while (it was obvious for the amount of trim he had already received). I didn't say anything and kept quiet till 2:30pm. At that point another barber murmured something in the owner's ear about me waiting. Immediately, the concerning barber said, "Hey, he was late!" At 2:40pm, I asked him, "Will you be able to get me done by 3pm because I have to pick him up from daycare." He says, "Do you have to be there exactly at 3pm?"

I don't think he understood the irony in the disrespect he showed for my time. Had the owner or him at any point just said, "I am sorry," I would have understood. Things happen.

Self righteousness and then being ironic isn't going to win you loyal customers. Please take care of your customers before your friends and be honest when you mess up.

Sincerely

Disappointed customer</text>

They are always busy. Without an appointment, it took me an hour before getting to sit down in a chair. They are a noisy and rambunctious group.

Which is why I love this establishment. They know what they are doing. They take their time to make sure your hair is cut perfectly.

The price reflects this as well. They are on the pricier side. You get what you pay for.<//review>

<review>5 stars easy, this place kicks ass! Very clean, well lit, and appealing environment happening here. More importantly razors are up to date and well taken care of. I'm extremely impressed and letting you know this is coming from one of the most anal hair-style enthusiast out there. Ask for Sergio, this guy takes the time to make sure you know what you want and exactly how you want it. However I'm confident the entire staff will live up to Sergio's performance.

<review>If you’re a guy getting your haircut anywhere else around chino hills you need to stop and come here. I’ve had terrible luck with haircuts around chino hills. The worst being chino hills barbershop. They’re hacks! Today I walked into traditions with no appointment and Matt fit me in his schedule immediately. This is a REAL barbershop. Best haircut I’ve had in a hot minute.<//review>< UserId.>

All great experiences overall except today when I tried to get a cut. Waited 2 hours... finally got called after 2-3 other names of people who were MIA( meaning it would have potentially been another few hours), when my wife calls from running errands and telling me the baby is freaking out so we gotta go... not the shops fault obviously, BUT!!! DO NOT GO W/O AN APPOINTMENT! I guess the other 2 times I went I was reeeallyy lucky I didn't have to wait long!</Review>

<Review>After moving to Chino Hills a year ago, I knew I had to begin the hunt of finding a new barber. Over the year I tried finding other local barbershops and even continued to go to my old barber in Rancho Cucamonga.

A few months ago, I noticed Traditions Barber Shop opened up around the corner from my place. I called ahead to make a reservation, even though they accept walk-ins, which may have changed since they're a lot busier now. The place has cool decor and once you enter you'll notice all the barbers talking to their clients and being attentive to their hair. Everyone's hair looks sharp too, which is always a good sign at a barbershop.

I've had two different barbers since going to Traditions, but that's my fault for not remembering their names. One came over from a competing barbershop and the other is new to cutting, but they both gave me really good cuts. From talking to both of them, they take pride in their trade and take their time with your hair. Your sides and fades will look clean and they'll do their post to match your needs. It's cash only, so that's my one hiccup. Hopefully that changes soon.</Review>< Pictures>

Get whatever uniforms you'd like. I did go in for nursing scrubs which they have a large selection of colors and sizes. they also have school uniforms which is great for my grandkids. Cannot exchange things for cash or credit but you can get a a store credit.<//Review>

<text>Pretty decent selection, though staff were unhelpful.  Just gotta go it on your own, really.  Disappointed that I couldn't find any size larger than a XL in women's (I'm a 2XL), but they did have that size in men's.  Liked that they also carried petites.  Prices were slightly cheaper than online, but since they didn't have my size I had to order them online in the end anyways.< /text>< Pics>

DONT GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!! This place has a HUGE selection and it is MUCH cheaper than Ceasar's!! You are not allowed to return anything, so be sure to try everything on first. I love the Dickies brand for scrubs because it is thick and durable. They had the size I needed and many colors. I'd definitely return and HIGHLY recommend! Sizes are XS-4XL, I believe.< /Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Disclaimer:  I love Mountain Mike's pizza.  I accidentally ordered from this store instead of my usual that gets five stars.  I've never left a negative review.

Ordered a medium Caesar salad, a pizza and churros.  Pizza arrived 15 minutes late and cold, despite ordering 1.5 hours ahead of my scheduled delivery time.  The order was listed as "ready" 10 minutes before it was supposed to be delivery.  Caesar salad was...well, not a Caesar.  Romaine lettuce, no Parmigiano, no dressing, but it did have croutons.  And olives, carrots, tomatoes, and tiny Cobbs of corn?!   The no dressing I can understand, because their setup in Doordarshan requires you to pick a dressing, but caesar wasn't listed!  And, the store has declined to allow special instructions that could've gotten this figured out!

My fault for ordering from a Mountain Mike's I never go to I guess.  Won't make that mistake again.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I had to cancel an order. The man on the line asked me why and even though I am not obligated to provide an answer I did. He continued to try to pressure me to keep the order and I had to firmly state to please cancel my order. He hung up on me without saying anything. I called back and when I explained that my order needs to be cancelled he raised his voice at me and lied saying that he already said he would. His tone, volume level, and words were aggressive. I tried to call back to get a confirmation that the order was cancelled and to ask if they had ran my card yet. He hung up on me without answering. Completely disrespectful and unprofessional. Not to mention the aggressiveness can be triggering for some people. I will not be spending my money here.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Ordered online and am a huge fan of mountain mikes pizza usually. I ordered double pepperoni and half of my pizza has double pepperoni while the other half has less than usual. I called the store and tried to explain it to the store manager he didn't care at all he said it is done by weight and that if i don't like it too bad. I highly recommend going to one of the other locations. Like i said it is usually a great franchise to eat at just not this location.< /Review>

<text>Empty buffet and never refilled. Salad bar, small trays of wilted salad and other stuff. $38. For 3 people.  Only 1 small Pizza was made for several tables of people that came in the whole time we were there for the buffet.  Waited for a while for more to be made. The manager said I should have mentioned the pizza was out. It's not my job to tell the employees to do their job. I'm there to relax and enjoy. There's a new Mountain Mikes on Monte Vista,  Vacaville. It has good service and good pizza and salad bar.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

This is my first experience with the Mountain Mikes on Alamo. I used to order from the one on monte Vista with NO issues.
I ordered the chicken club which comes with white sauce. I get home and discover it was made with red sauce. Truly disappointed and because I’m not feeling well, I don’t have the energy to drive back to complain.
I won’t be ordering from this particular mountain mikes again.</text>

My husband and I went in here yesterday to try it for the first time. Upon walking in we were not acknowledged at all. The gentleman behind the counter was on the phone taking someone’s order (being extremely rude to the individual on the phone I might add). So my husband and I were patiently waiting and looking over the menu. A female worker was up front as well but walked away when she saw us. About 5-10mins pass and the staff still did not acknowledge us or offer to take our order even while we stood right in front of them at the counter. Then the staff walked into the back and left us standing there. So we decided to leave and as we were walking out the rude gentleman decided to acknowledge us and yell across the room if he could help us. Horrible customer service and the staff was rude and unprofessional! We left and will NOT return to this location.<//Text>

I've always gotten a good pizza from here. I do not get it delivered. I actually show up and get it. I see all of the crappy reviews and they are based on the delivery service. Well get off of your butts and go down and pick it up.  On the flip side delivery is an important part of a pizza chain and accounts for a good percentage of their business I would imagine. If I were them I would raise my standards to meet their clienteles needs.< /review>

< Review>
Your delivery man was nice however we ordered our pizza at 5:40pm and it did not arrive until right now at 7:30pm after we were told it would be 45 minutes max. When we called to check the status after an hour, they said the driver had already left. It takes 8 minutes to drive from that store to our address and the young lady that answered the phone was completely rude. Needless to say, we will not be ordering pizza from your establishment ever again. Thank you!</Review>

<review>When they get a little busy the quality of the pizza shows it. The lack of care in making the pizza and lack of cheese will ensure I never go here again. Other Mountain Mike's locations make much better pizza.</review>< pics>

Wish this was a negative star I've tried both locations in vacaville and they both are slow and have burnt the pizza and take over an hour that they quote. I will not be buying or recommending this corporation to anyone. Stay away</review>

<user_name>Bryan “Bryan Lupercio” Lupercio</user_name><review>The only negative thing about this shopping mall is that it only has one way entrance. And the only way to get out is turning back off Jefferson. Definitely a nice shopping mall with best buy and a bunch of places to eat! Plentiful parking spaces. Handi cap wheelchair friendly. Careful people drive a little nutty in that parking lot!</review>< Time>

The only negative thing about this shopping mall is that it only has one way entrance. And the only way to get out is turning back off Jefferson. Definitely a nice shopping mall with best buy and a bunch of places to eat! Plentiful parking spaces. Handi cap wheelchair friendly. Careful people drive a little nutty in that parking lot!< /review>

Going to this shopping center is like a trip to any government entity. Poorly thought out point of ingress and egress. There's only one way in & one way out. And you combine that with aggressive, rude or just clueless California drivers, you have a recipe for road rage, accidents & mayhem. Hate going to this location & avoid it at all costs.<//Text>

I am addicted to this place! Whenever I end up in there, I end up needing about $20,000 of merchandise every time. Sadly, I only live with a few items. But it keeps me going back halfway all the time!

Super friendly staff is well by the way. The place is also extremely clean and orderly. Well done to the management and employees of this place so far.< /Review>

A maze of stores to choose from. Just off the 78 freeway near the 5 freeway, Pacific Coast Plaza has mostly big-box retailers like Best Buy, Dick's sporting goods, Walmart, Bed Bath and Beyond, among others. There's only one entrance and exit, which can be frustrating if the store you're going to is at the very end of the plaza. I usually come here to shop at the Best Buy, since they have a larger camera selection than normal stores.<//Text>

7E2B23: Quite a few popular stores in the shopping square including Walmart, Best Buy etc. Usually fairly busy with lot of cars going in and out of parking lot. Parking lot adequate to handle the traffic with adequate size parking stalls. The parking lot lights were out in the section where parked out car close to Best Buy.< /Review>

Pacific coast plaza is a good place to take care of a lot of your errands in one stop, well maybe a couple of stops because it's rather large. There is a large variety of retailers in this shopping center all the way from Walmart, Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, Satsples, Party City, Stater Brothers, the list goes on.. And if you want you can even get your nails done if you want. easy access and centrally located near interstate 5 and highway 78 in Oceanside off Jefferson Street.</text>

Oh my God
This is like the best plaza, pacific coast plaza. Hit it up! Skate the parking lot! Loiter! It's just a nice place to have shops and maybe do a kick flip. We do Krumpin in the parking lot on Sundays. Five dollars. Kids eat free. A plus pacific coast plaza. You need to be here! What you doing< /Review>

Convenient shopping center. Needs parking lot work(repave etc). Good parking and not alot of typical traffic congestion. Quiet shady sports to park, or even to stop and eat in your car.< /text>

<Text>O.K. Best Buy is here and the only reason I went there is because only they had what I was looking for. If you've ever read my review about them before you know how I feel about them... my last employer when I got hurt there 19 years ago and haven't worked every since we refer to them as S**k Buy!<//Text>< Name>

Plenty of parking. There's a Walmart and the Bed Bath & Beyond. Across the street there are food options such as Mimi's Cafe sandwich shops. I work in this Plaza and I like that I can just head over to the Walmart and pick up items for my family.< /Text>

< Review>
Places clean seems well-organized you don't see some buildings that need work and others that look like they were from a couple centuries ago people are generally friendly and there's a lot of shops to choose from and a variety of different things.</Review>
