Good concept on subs, good bread, but the two subs I tried taste the same, like salt with a small hint of grease and bread. It would have been a lot better if it was less salty.< /text>

I placed my order online for pick up during my lunch break at 11am. I received an email confirmation and then another email that my order would be ready at 1030. So I took an early lunch break, walked over and was told that my order was not ready and that I misunderstood the email and they hadn't sent it. They then quickly put my sandwich together. The food is yummy, however, the service left quite a bit to be desired. I will think twice before ordering here when I have a limited time frame to pick up and eat. If you have time to wait, this place is a nice lunch spot.<//text>

<Text>I had the Steak Sandwich and the HUGE Tater Tots that easily fed more than 2! It was ALL delicious and I can't wait to try all the amazing different sandwiches, different style Tots, sauces and more! EXTRA POINTS for being DOG FRIENDLY on the patio!  Oh, the bread is also baked fresh right at an East County Bakery! I support Small Local Businesses, so me and my pooches will make this a regular spot! I also noticed a Hobo Special! A BEER and a Sandwich for $8!! I pay that just for a beer at surrounding places! There are T.V.'s to watch Sports too! Win/Win!  Yayyy... :-) On a different note. the staff was very friendly and the restaurant AND bathrooms were very clean on my first visit! :-)<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I was a fan of firehouse and have been into Growlers a few times since it changed.  I have to be honest I really think the sandwiches are better now than before.  The staff is friendlier and I had a chance to talk with the owner Sean and he is very friendly and committed to his business.  Well done and thanks for staying in our community.<//Review>

I even called and left my phone number to be called back, to no avail. No reply at all. It used to be a good place for a sandwich.

So after eating part of the sandwich I decided to go from 2 stars to 1... dry bland bread wA crumbling as if was old, lettuce was limp and onion wasn’t crunchy more so chewy I didn’t even eat it.

Just ok. Always smells like they haven't changed their mop water in a while. The big drain in front of the soda machine is a huge hazard. And the food isn't consistent. They are frequently out of things. Not one of my top choices for sandwiches. Not even in my top 3< /text>

We came into town and had some running around to do. We wanted to grab a bite and this place was right there, so we thought we would check it out. My huaband had mentioned earlier in the day how he wished there was a fire house subs in town. We were pleasantly surprised when we walked in and this place is exactly like firehouse subs! So we grabbed a few sandwiches and enjoyed them!<//Review>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>We ordered a sandwich online. It got check off as being ready about 15 minutes early, so we went straight there. Unfortunately, it was not yet ready oh, but we did figure out what happened. The guy who was going to make the sandwich clicked on the order in his system. He thought that meant he was making the sandwich, but apparently that sends a message to the customer saying it is ready. Okay, that's nobody's fault. Just a miscommunication. While we were waiting for the sandwich, I decided to order some tater tots to go with our meal. It was called something like Josh's mess. We're vegetarian, so I ordered it without the pepperoni. Unfortunately, that came with the pepperoni. The food was delicious, but the service was questionable. It did appear that they were busy doing training, so we are giving them a pass on this one awarding four stars. Usually, they are pretty good.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>I hope they do well.  I read an article about this being the same owners but no longer wanted to be in the franchise business model.  The eateries along this road don't seem to get the traffic they deserve, or need.

Service was friendly and order taking process is fast.  The prep time for the food took some time.  The sandwich was made to order and it was served _really_ hot and that takes some time.  It wasn't really busy so it felt like a bit too long.  I don't eat many subs but I'd rather come here over the others in town.</Review>< Name>

He's a veteran, and a local, small business owner. (Big fan of supporting local!) The place is clean and charming, the staff are very friendly and helpful, and at the end of it all- the food is great! Lots of variety of sandwiches, chili fries, salads, soups, and more. We stop all the time to get these tasty gourmet sandwiches (we love the meatball sub, the sausage sub, and the cheesesteak ones) on our way to outdoor adventures, or for just a "picnic" at home. It's in a great location and is worth a visit! Forget the big chain sandwich shops and give a taste to some of the best sammies I've tried in a long time a try! What do you have to lose?</review>< Pictures>

Was eager to try the new food however I'm definitely disappointed and miss the old place. Ordered two meatball subs that both came out with cold meatballs and no flavor. The prices also seem higher than before, which was also a disappointment considering the quality of food.<//text>

Wanted to try the new place out so ordered online and sent one of my guys to go pick up the order.  I had a combo on one order (add tots & drink).  When my guy came back, no rink no tots.  Also, they seemed to completely ignore the add-ons (grilled onions, peppers, etc.) So I called and asked for a refund of the difference for the missing combo.  After several minutes waiting listening to the cashiers try to figure things out and take other people's orders, the guy finally came back, apologized, and said he didn't know how.  He gave me the phone number to the manager.  So I called her.  She was out driving so asked me to send her details to her email.  I did.  So far, 3 days later, no response, no refund.
Now, as to the food:  Aside from the orders being messed up, the sandwiches are small and not very good.  Not worth the price.  Too bad. Was looking for another good sandwich place.</text>

Tried it 3 times and should have quit after the first. Poor service, wrong orders, and overpriced. Stick to Subway or treat yourself to Submarina (Antonellis being the sandwich Cadillac in East County).<//text>

<text>Only second review I have ever written but felt the need to. This is no Firehouse, if you our thinking about going here rethink that, I waited for 30 minutes during lunch time on Friday for there signature sandwich. When I arrived there was no one in line. I see no reason for it to take 30 minutes for a sandwich during lunch time on a Friday except poor management. Once I got the sandwich it was even worse. They call it  a Growler but all it is a so so Bratwurst with some sauce and grilled onions with peppers,. I got a bag of chips & soda for $12.00!!!! Needless say I wont be back again.< /text>< pictures>

So disappointed! If I hadn’t already parked the car and gotten my family out, I would have chosen somewhere else to eat. They got rid of their soda fountain, so their limited beverage selection left my son drinking water. They also got rid of their small size sandwiches. The prices are way to high for this type of sandwich shop. We won’t return!</review>

<rating>1</rating><text>Absaloutley horrible! Worst sandwich place I have ever experienced! got me and my dads sandwiches both completey wrong. Smelt horrible in there it smelt better outside and cleaner. My dad ordered a sandwich with everything I guess that means nothing on it... they put wheat bread on my snadwitch instead of my dads I can’t have weat and he is supposed to have weat he got my white bread on his sandiwitch he can’t have white bread! Completely dry,  turkey tasted like bacon and was so so salty. I will not be coming back sorry. Submarina is a lot better. I’m sorry I wish I had a better experience here I had high hopes. We are very disappointed because now we don’t have time to go any where else for lunch. :(<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dbfd549313144b:0xd46fb8f92ff62dbf< /GmapID></record>

The menu has drasticly changed since Changing names. Now, there is nothing I would care to order (my preference). The variety is good but not quite suited for the assortment of food or the amount given.</Text>

<text>Former store of Firehouse Subs. Same owner. Possibly a woman named Nic. Excellent sandwiches but same hi prices as when Fhouse was around, ~$2+ higher than they should be, (to be competitive with Subway and Jersey Mike's I'd say). But so good once in a while! I see they're applying for a liquor license..hmmm..🍻 Tater tots!</text><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>I ordering two sandwiches, a veggie and a ham, Turkey, bacon.  The veggie had nasty, what seemed to be canned mushrooms, which I was told were sauteed, I paid extra for avocado which i got small pieces throughout the sub, jalapenos that I did not ask for l, and it was soggy.  My husband ordered lettuce, cucumbers, and jalapenos his sub.  He just got ham, Turkey, bacon and jalapenos. No lettuce, bacon or cucumbers! Polite staff, not good subs.</review>< pictures>

Sadly the place was a let down. The service was so so not great. The two sandwiches my wife and I ordered were not good and seemed more like a bad salad on bread then a sandwich. I spent 28$ dollars on two footlongs.</text>

Its okay for now. Id like to see them get more established and see what their potential is. I took my kids on a monday, as kids eat free mondays and wednesdays with the purchase of a meal. They failed to tell me that they were out of several ingredients that belonged on my sandwich.< /Text>

My only complaint is true of most clothing stores: they change to the next season of clothes way too early. I came here to get my daughter something to wear and it's 90 degrees. Almost everything in the store is long-sleeves, it's just hard to justify buying anything for her right now while she's still in the constantly growing out of things stage.< /Text>

This location is unique as it is actually a Disney baby store with clothing and a few stuffed toys for babies and toddlers. It's small but well organized with plenty of great selections, including a decent clearance section. I went in spring and found a soft, plush bath robe, sun hat and swim attire for my little boy. If you know a baby or toddler that would look sweet in Disney products I recommend checking it out. :)<//text>

They have the best food here! Hands down amazing Chinese food and I’m extremely picky. The owners are so friendly and kind. This is the best place I’ve been to in all of LA so far and they have a huge menu with a lot of vegan options which are also amazing. The orange chicken is my favorite, and even the vegan option tastes just like it. Beef fried rice is good too! This place is a must try.<//Review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>Well if they wanted to try this place for a while very interesting because it has regular selections and vegetarian vegan selections. So I was enthused!  Once I opened the door I actually had to wait a few minutes then call out before somebody new I was waiting to order. I will say there are 2 nice things about the place once you break the ice with the owner service was very good Is food was fairly simple no heavy sauces in what I ordered Is the food tasted fresh and very flavourful but simple ingredients 2 dishes and an appetiser. There was a decent amount of food That could feed 2 people. But every dish is around the 18 to $20 price range even the appetiser was expensive total bill was over $63 for 2 people for take out at a Chinese joint I think is overpriced. I also cannot say the meal was worth it or spectacular. It was good. The only exception I can come to or conclusion is it's in the calabas as area so the price point is higher. I dined in at a Latin restaurant instrument oaks a few weeks ago service was impeccable Drinks and so much food everything was tasty excellent an exceptional bill was just under $40 This was appetiser salad and a full meal plate. Hence the 3 stars.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

If I can give them more than 5 stars, it could be 10 stars or even more. They totally deserve it :D<//Text>< UserId.>

Tasty but pricey. Had a Szechwan dish and some soup, everything tastes very nice and the presentation is good! I agree with another comment that it’s a little “touristy” but overall the ambience is nice, the staff is courteous and the food is just above average.< /Text>

She brought out the most delicious dish colossal shrimp with favors of turmeric and lemongrass with a side of white rice. They are also known for their vegan food.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>High-end Chinese fusion in Agoura Hills? I'm in!

Mandarin Lotus is located right off the 101 freeway on Kanan Road. I never knew this place existed until my friend started raving about it a few weekends ago at the Chili Cook Off. Based on what she said, I knew I needed to go check it out. I was not disappointed.

To my surprise, this restaurant was established in 1988. Formerly known as Mandarin Express, this restaurant specializes in Michelin-inspired Eurasian cuisine, with unique molecular gastronomy techniques and recipes. Fusion recipes include tastes from many cuisines, including French, Spanish, and Thai, to name a few. Their ingredients are definitely high quality and fresh.

I've been here a couple times now, and both times were excellent. This is definitely elevated Chinese cuisine, and they have very interesting items on the menu. Their menu is actually huge, with countless options to choose from ranging from low price to very expensive high-end. I've only been for lunch, so I've only gone cheap with the broccoli beef lunch special, but I am curious about a number of their other items. I will say, the broccoli beef is very good here, and the rice is cooked to perfection.

If you've never been, I'd definitely say this is a worthwhile restaurant to visit if you're in the area. Service is very nice, but maybe not the quickest. They do cook all of their food fresh to order, so this isn't much of a complaint, just a heads up to those in a rush. Due to the proximity to my office, I'll likely be back soon. Go ahead and give it a try for yourself!< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0B2D1ZKoeTU4YWWcmmI55DaSBvulnqIJcqHP8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4SzmQWGU_l4PPzcuDhlbXH9cdWA1n-l2nafJL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdTIc_KMsmK1VXgVCSA5xUsDo0mgsZq3gagzVD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>At the risk of sounding hyperbolic, this is the best Asian Vegetarian/Vegan food in Los Angeles and environs....and possibly in the known universe. The care that Dan takes with his amazingly original recipes is astonishing. And his wife Kim, who does everything else, is the loveliest person imaginable.  We have eaten here dozens of times, trying all the vegan things listed on the menu that I have never seen anywhere else and are always blown away.  Its a new standard of excellence for vegan food!< /text></record></dataset><record>

I don't recall the name of this dish. But as you can see, it's a life changer. Also if you like calamari, you're in heaven. Try them all.< /text>

Stopped by on a whim because the restaurant I had meant to go to was closed. The owner was extremely nice and welcoming, and helped me order off a rather large menu. The food was delicious, and exquisitely plated and presented. Well worth the cost, and I'm sure I'll go again.< /text>

Dan and Kim are incredibly nice and friendly people. A week ago my husband and I were traveling through Calabasas from Las Vegas, NV and fortunately found Mandarin Lotus. The food was fresh, healthy, delicious.... actually very very delicious! We called in and placed an order for pick up, when we arrived Dan met us near the entrance and greeted us personally. They gave us complimentary mango rolls and a few mandarins! Prices are very fair for what you get, portions are big, food is really very delicious and made to order. They have a very big menu to choose from half of which are vegetarian and vegan options!
Next time we'll be in California this will be the first place to visit!

Thank you Dan and Kim for such an incredible experience!</Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>The menu here is extensive, and every dish is cooked to order fresh. As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciated the fact that the dishes were fully customizable since they are made to order- I knew I had nothing to worry about from an allergy standpoint.

We came tonight (Father's Day) as a large group with multiple, let's just say, difficult personalities. Although the service was a little slow, it was only one person working front of house, one working the back, so they absolutely were doing the best they could. Patience paid off, as the food was absolutely delicious. There was not a single dish that was off in any way shape or form. In fact, a couple of the dishes were made with vegetarian meat, and 2 beef conissuers accidentally ate one of the mock beef dishes and had no idea they did- it was that good.  In the future, with a large group, I may consider ordering to go, but as I mentioned, patience pays off dining in. Looking forward to returning in the future.<//Text>< Pictures>

One of my favorite places for Mandarin cuisine. I love everything on the menu. A little pricey but the portions are LARGE! Kim takes care of all customers. You feel like you're visiting a friend who's serving dinner. Advice.. order ahead. They take pride in every plate served and it takes a little longer.<//review>

Kim is so attentive and sweet and Dan makes the most delicious and beautifully presented food. I’ve been coming here for years and I am still working my way through their incredibly extensive menu! No matter what I try, it’s always amazing!</text>

BEST PLACE EVER!!!
The most delicious chinese food I’ve ever had! I’ve eaten at many Michelin restaurants over the years and Chef Dan is truly Michelin quality. He has raised the bar on what Chinese Fusion can be. The food is plated beautifully and that is just the beginning of your satisfying experience. Chef Dan has the gift of flavor. The combination of a wide array of ingredients and spices are inspired by different parts of the world. The explosion of diverse flavors play an ineffable symphony on your taste buds.
This is a most come place!
Chef Dan and Kim are the best!!! I am a customer for life!!!<//review>

Mandarin Lotus serves the most amazing Chinese/fusion food. Everything is so delicious. Kim and Dan are not only a wonderful people and proprietors but also extremely creative. Chicken and beef options are outstanding according to our family meat eaters and I find the vegetarian options to be so unique and tasty (Wish I could be more specific, but I always order whatever they recommended and it is always spot on!).. this place is a gem!</Review>

<review>Food was ok at best. Clearly catering to the tourist. The spicy Won Ton was outstanding everything else was slightly better than mall food court or Panda Express Chinese food.  One saving grace might be the sizzling platters. Everyone else ordered them we didn't. Our mistake possibly.</review>< pics>

Wow.  Over priced by about 80%.  Just in case you think I'm exaggerating.   Two bowls of soup, an appetizer of two small soft shell crabs, one dinner of pork ribs- d-boned and deep fried (very dry) with a lot of over cooked onions, too small pieces of red pepper and about 10 green beans.   We did get two egg rolls on the house and two small pieces of mango compliments of the house for $75.00.  I was also reprimanded for asking for a second refill of ice tea.  They only give one refill.  They have been there 30 years and for the life of me I  can't figure out how that happened???< /Text>

This is THE BEST Chinese cuisine I've ever had. I don't live anywhere nearby but I always come here whenever I'm in Agoura. The salt and pepper calamari is absolutely fantastic. Hands down the best. The Kelsey Grammar chicken is always a good choice as well. Very friendly, family run business. I only wish I lived closer!< /text>

This 'hole-in-the-wall' actually has great food - high quality and well prepared. The owners are always looking to be of service. The food isn't cheap, but the product is more than worth it. Vegetarians have a full menu of "mock" meat dishes that cannot be beat. Celebrities often drop in.</Text>

Do not understand the high ratings.  Ate there twice and it was horrible.  When I first saw the extensive menu I thought I was in heaven but what is on the menu and what you get served are very different.  I've only been there for lunch and they only had one guy (the owner) in the kitchen.</Text>

<username>Darth Rad< /username><time>1239951364205</time><rate>5< /rate><Review>So, this is my seventh year living in Oak Park, and the first time that I've been to this amazing hole in the wall restaurant!    I'd always been vaguely aware of this nondescript restaurant - it's squeezed in a tiny space in a strip mall,  near the karate center, Nick Rail's music,  behind the IHOP, and way behind the Jack in the Box at the corner of Kanan and the 101 off-ramp.  I guess it was the "Express" in the name which made me think it was something like "Panda Express" - take out pseudo-Chinese junk food.  Or maybe it was the small restaurant space and buffet-like store counter which you can see through the front windows, also reminiscent of a fast food take out restaurant.  Panda Express it most definitely is not.  Mandarin Express is of all things a fancy gourmet restaurant!   Chinese-Mediterranean-Californian fusion food.   They take some basic Chinese food ingredients and cook it with a variety of vegetables and spices from around the world. You can eat an all-vegetarian meal here!  There's an entire page of mock duck/chicken/shrimp/pork dishes.   But their shrimp and other meat dishes are terrific too.  The food just bursts with multiple flavors in your mouth.  I really think they should re-name the place, or at least take out the "Express" part from the name.  It just doesn't do the place justice.  The owner-cooks are really friendly too.  A great place to take your best friends and family!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80e826ab6e3b9443:0xb12aabb77ef4d1b3<//Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
Apart from the fact, Mr owner ripped us off and charged us automatically on the bill a service charge, the place was ok. We had to ask for many, waited about half hour for the food and then charged $55 for two mains (rice included) and two glasses of water. We were stupid to tell him we are from UK so i guess he tried his luck on the service charge and he succeeded. Shame we did not know the US customs. Food nice but I have had better in that price range. We will surely come never again (what the owner knew) :)<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>My son went here a lot when he lived in the area. So he chose it for his birthday dinner. When we got there it was obvious the owners knew him and had missed him. They asked about one of his friends that had passed away. In fact everyone that came in that night gave and received personal and warm greetings. It was like a family gathering.

What could inspire such happiness beyond cordial friendliness?

The food! It was close your eyes and luxuriate awesome!

While my son and I noticed changes to the orange chicken, it was still delicious. This is not a static restaurant. It's fusion. They learn and incorporate from a variety of food cultures. So the OC (which BTW we never found in China) they reimagined was great - no skimping on anything.

We tried the shrimp they recommended but declined to eat it shell and all (if you've been to China you know about exoskeleton delicacies - a taste we haven't acquired). But even though we took off the shells, the seasoning was too incredible not to nibble off from the usually discarded shell. And the seasoning on the included vegetables led to who gets the last one squabbles.

Mongo beef - great. Cashew chicken- great. Chicken fried rice - ok anywhere else but with how everything else was spiced to perfection it suffered by comparison but was still enjoyable.

There were many other artistic and culinary touches that enhanced the food experience. This is not a decor destination. This is about the food and people dedicated to their craft and growing with it. And genuinely loving it.

My wif and I loved it too. It's now on our list to return in a month for a date night.

I hope you'll try it and love it too.

Be seeing you!< /Review>< Pictures>

The tofu here is out of this world!  It rivals Cafe Yumm in Oregon. This is the best Chinese food ever ! it's healthy good food. One person had sweet and sour chicken and loved it.
I had French basil tofu and someone else had the classic Szechuan Tofu. We will be back again and again!<//text>

<review>OK, I'm not picky when I'm starving, but this food was awful! I'll never go there again. We had chicken and broccoli, pork fried rIce and "random" meat potstickers. The only thing good was the broccoli, no lie. Today is Chinese New Year so we thought we'd splurge and get Chinese food from a new place for us. I'm not sure how long it's been around, but this was the first and LAST time we'll go there. Seriously, I've  never written a bad review on Yelp, but this place motivated me to type!!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<text>I won't be coming back. I got the lunch special and the food was way overpriced for the food you are getting (small portions, wonton didn't have any filling, egg roll wasn't fresh). On top of this, they charge extra for soup when it is pretty standard for lunch specials at Chinese places to include soup (mind you, the others are charging half the price)! One last chance for redemption: service...service was slow, even when there was only one other person in the restaurant.< /text>< rating>

Delicious food,  great staff.  I've been coming here for one year now and have explored much of the menu,  but there is still more to try (menu has well over three hundred + items). Fresh &  healthy, what more could you ask for?

Try the traditional dishes,  or be adventurous and check out Chang's Signature Creations on the menu.  Either way you can't go wrong.

The worst part about this location honestly is the pricing, even for a single player looking to get some time on a table to practice. The only redeeming quality is the fact that the equipment is very nice-both tables and house cues. However, given its location, it doesn't seem like there is much of a scarcity of patrons on any given evening, so I don't expect the pricing to come down anytime soon...

Haven't tried the food, but I never see anyone here eating and from the looks of the menu, it truly seems like more would be desired, especially given the price range of table time.

It is definitely a nice hangout spot for a group of friends, family-friendly atmosphere for sure, and in general I would recommend this place to have a fun time. But be aware that pricing for table time increases as the number of people present in a group at any one table increases.< /Review>

One of my favorite places to play pool. I enjoyed the feel of the place. The pool table and equipment were all in great condition. The staff were welcoming and helpful. Parking wasn't too bad although that may depend on when you go. Would definitely go there again.</text>

Tables are in excellent condition. They sell beer and soda. When it's packed on weekends they have terrible ratchet hip-hop playing but there is a juke box if you are desperate for something else.</text>

Been going here for a couple of years now and I'll say the vibe here is pretty nice. Good price for games, tables are easy to come by and drinks aren't to expensive. Real nice place to chill with some friends or bring a casual date.<//Review>

I got tired of being deafened by loud, annoying bar music and drunken bros in PB so I took to the streets searching for a better pool place. This spot's very comfortable and has plenty of felt (I've never had to wait for an open table). The place seems to be asian run, and most of their clientele is as well (which made me feel slightly uncomfortable on first visit- being the only white guy there), but they turned out to be quite friendly and inviting. I highly recommend popping in if you're looking for a slightly quieter spot where you can actually hear another person from across the table.< /Text>

Great location to charge your Tesla while you shop at Target-Sunnyvale. There's about 8-9 Tesla Superchargers and you can find them in the parking lot of Target-Sunnyvale. They were all empty when we got there and when we left, one was being used.<//Text>

Very popular so almost always occupied. Better check on the app for available chargers before going. Can just put in charging, finishing shopping at Target and be back. The speed of charging will vary on few factors but mostly it's same average speed like other charging centers.<//review>

Most of the time only 8 superchargers are working. Out of these 8 (one is handicap charging). So technically for normal public only 7. Really pathetic management by Tesla at high usage supercharger.</text>

<text>While at least one (at times 3) stations are defunct - the upside with Sunnyvale supercharger is their 150kw chargers lineup.
None else in South Bay vicinity go beyond 75kw (Only Fremont has 225kw? Level 3 superchargers). Clean and spacious, however.<//text>< Gmap_id>

Some distance to major highways, and this charger is definitely for local apartment dwellers or small business employees while shopping at the Target area. Not being stereotypical, to own a Tesla and charge the car overnight at home is the quality way to go and should be planned financially and lifestylely. Stalls are fully occupied quickly around 11:30 on weekend. The only feeling good thing is it's easier to maneuver cars here than the Cupertino location. Still there are many ICE and Teslas wandering around along with Target's 18 wheelers and other delivery trucks.</Text>

<name>Abilash M</name><date>1546486620229</date><rate>4</rate><review>Conveniently located in there Target complex. There is a Starbucks inside Target if you want to wait somewhere while your car is charging. There are 10 spots and one spot for disabled tags in this location.

Since this is the only supercharger in Sunnyvale area and also since there are a lot more Tesla's, most of these spots are occupied during the day and during the weekends. They tend to be free during the nights after 11:00 PM.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

We'll lit.  Easy to find.
Just enough chargers... for now; I anticipate the area will outgrow these in the very near future.</review>

< review>
Some distance to major highways, and this charger is definitely for local apartment dwellers or small business employees while shopping at the Target area. Not being stereotypical, to own a Tesla and charge the car overnight at home is the quality way to go and should be planned financially and lifestylely. Stalls are fully occupied quickly around 11:30 on weekend. The only feeling good thing is it's easier to maneuver cars here than the Cupertino location. Still there are many ICE and Teslas wandering around along with Target's 18 wheelers and other delivery trucks. Charging currents are mostly on the low side but still faster than other DCFC. Save the hassle and enjoy a quality time with your family at other places. I certainly welcome more Superchargers, simply for more options when needed! Ought to replace half the gas station pumps with chargers.</review>

Brought in a laptop having issues with windows crashing. Was diagnosed with bad hard drive.they replaced the hard drive and was quoted with a reasonable price. Printer driver also had issues and they fixed it. Good job guys! Saved me from buying a new laptop! Thanks!</Review>

They easily identified the parts I would need for the phone and even a valuable recommendation to prolong the life of the phone. The finished product is as good as new and they were always prompt to answer questions.<//Text>

< Review>
Brought my Laptop in on Friday Oct.9th with a broken screen,tech was Hammad Naveed. l called them Monday the 12th to get an update, was told tech was not in and he would call me later in the day, never got a call back. Called the next day got the same run around. Wednesday the 14th I finally get a call back and the tech tells me the same thing he told me 5 whole days earlier and asks if I’d like him to order the part at this point I just need my laptop for school and don’t have time to bring it to another shop so I tell him to order it and do the 2day shipping. So I call Friday to get and update on the part, and to see what day it should be in, he tries to tell me the tracking doesn’t give him a day as if I have never ordered a package before. Finally after refusing to get off the phone he tells me the tracking says It should arrive Monday. So I call Monday The 19th and they say it should be in later and they’ll give me a call back, Shockingly I don’t receive a call. So I call the next day Tuesday the 20th and they give me the run around again saying it’ll either be in later or the next day. I start to get irritated and tell them I will not be paying for the expedited shipping and Magically my part appears and they say it will be done later today. They’ll fix your laptop but NOT WITHOUT TREATING YOU LIKE AN IDIOT AND GIVING YOU THE RUN AROUND FOR 2 WEEKS. TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE<//Review>

I went to iGeek Tech Repair and unfortunately I did not really get my laptop repaired. It was an somewhat an Mac Pro that had perhaps damage on the touchpad so moving the mouse was difficult and hard at times. I knew that I probably could fix it by getting a repair tool kit myself from the internet and doing it myself which would have costed me 30 dollars but I wanted to see if professionals could do it for faster and cheaper. Although I commend the staff for maintaining professional standards, the feedback I heard back from them was extremely vague about what was the issue. Perhaps I did not give them enough time but I needed the laptop back by a certain date. I given them one day and a half to hopefully fix my laptop. I given my laptop on a Friday afternoon but I needed it back my Monday morning for school work.

I tried calling them back and they said they couldn't find the issue but I needed my Mac back so I went to get it back on Sunday afternoon. The touchpad was still glitchy at times and I knew that it was not completely fixed.
Here is my complaint:
The problem wasn't that my laptop didn't get fixed. It was the problem that they charged me a whole 50 dollars as service fee for just opening it up and not repairing it at all. Now I would have been fine if they reduced it down to maybe 20 or even 25 dollars (because they didn't repair anything). But a whole 50 dollars seems too extreme to me for just opening up a laptop and not explaining the details of why they could not repair the touchpad or even figuring out the issue with it. Now keep it mind I would have paid the 50 dollars if they would able to provide a professional checkup worksheet of perhaps what parts were damaged or perhaps explain to me properly what the issue really was. However, they just said that they could not figure things out and just said to me I needed to pay the 50 dollars and I could have my laptop back.

Now I would maybe give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they do not work with macs that often since mac have a reputation for being hard to repair. I would understand that. But in reality I am just writing this review to show that I had a horrible experience and not all experiences are 5 stars as others. I would say that if you are a windows laptop user, you would probably be fine since those are easier to repair than macs. However, if you are a mac user, you are really taking a 50/50 gamble on this place maybe.< /text>

I have used Hammad a few times to repair laptops. The first time was when he was still working out of his house back in 2014. Now that he has a shop, he still offers the same level of customer service he did then. Prices are way more reasonable than the competitior prices and his turnaround time is quick. He's very professional and runs a good business. My laptop OS had to be replaced and an SSD was installed. When I got it back, it was quicker at starting up and loading programs than when I first bought it. I was also able to get it back the same day I took it in (I work from home and only had to miss out on one afternoon of work) Would definitely recommend!</text>

Very glad I came here! My brother had cracked my screen on my laptop so I started calling around for prices until I came upon igeek. Hammad offered a very reasonable price compared to other techs in Elk Grove and was able to get it done sooner. He kept me updated and did a great job! Great customer service and a really nice guy!<//Text>

My kids always wear out phones and iGeek Elk Grove keeps them running whenever tbere is a disaster. It’s funny watching them have to deal with life without thier babies when a repair takes an hiur or two!! I finally had a phone problem and they fixed it quickly and for no cost. Not saying they’re giving away free phone repairs but mine just had gunk down in the charger housing. Took one min to fix. Anyway, that is why we stick with iGeek - reliable phone fixes!</text>

<review>I am so glad that I have found iGeek Tech. I felt that Hammad was very honest and professional. He was quick in his service. And he does work outside of his home (which didn't bother me) but will soon have a store off Laguna and Big Horn. I will definitely recommend Hammad.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x809ac7933b1634a7:0x79ed31589ed488a4< /gmapID></record>

I started getting some pop ups on my new macbook (so much for a virus free apple product). So I called iGeek Tech and he was able to quote me right over the phone. I must say his prices were very reasonable compared to other companies I called. He sounded very experienced and told me it'd be done in just a few hours. Which was great turnaround compared to Geek Squad which takes weeks! At first it was odd that he operated from home, but Hammad was very welcoming and kind and had a standard setup inside. Overall it was a great experience. Would come back again!< /text>

Great experience with iGeek Tech Repair! I had an older IBM laptop that needed a lot of work done - from virus removal to updating memory. Hammad from iGeek was very friendly and professional. The job took about two days but Hammad updated me on the progress. Excellent service - Thank You iGeek Tech Repair!!!<//review>

I received customer service from igeek that I have not received from many places. He was easy to work with and incredibly flexible to work with my schedule I would recommend him to anyone. No matter what your computer problem might be give him a call and he will help you. He is a good man and thorough.</Review>

Hammed know's his business, a few tech's attempted to fix our laptops and were not able to!  He checked them, called me, and repaired them when the others couldn't! He knew what he was doing, did it in a timely manner and costs were reasonable!  He is Very Dependable!!  We are overly satisfied with his work! We HIGHLY recommend him to everyone, and give him FIVE STARS *****  If your a none believer, GIVE HIM A TRY!!< /Review>

<review>I can honestly say especially for a college student, that my laptop is my lifeline; therefore anything that goes wrong with it or underperforms for the tasks I need it for- I know that I can take it to iGeekTech Repair. Fairly priced, easy, and guaranteed warranty for 30 days means that in the event that anything goes wrong with my device, I know it will be taken care of. Amazing Work!</review>< Rate>

I was referred to iGeek by a friend, and boy am I glad that I was. Hammad is a wonderfully patient man who does a fantastic job of communicating to his customers what the issue is, what his potential courses of action are, what the cost will be, and even a bit about why all in language accessible to those without a technical background. Every step of the way he makes sure to keep you informed, and goes out of his way to do so via the medium you prefer.

The turnaround alone would be worth seeing iGeek for; I've never experienced any kind of tech support so fast and efficient. He was able to diagnose and repair the problem uwith my laptop's hard drive in less than 24 hours in total, and his prices are only made even more reasonable by the comparatively high prices of Best Buy and the like. I cannot think of a single thing about my experience with iGeek to criticize; while I am now a native of Southern California, but if I have tech problems I would consider the drive just to take them to iGeek. This level of customer service is a fantastic, rare thing.<//Text>

<GmapID>0x809ac7933b1634a7:0x79ed31589ed488a4< /GmapID><review>So, I randomly started getting these pop ups on my laptop and they started to get really bad and annoying. I looked online and found iGeek, along with a few others,  via Craigslist. I called all the places and ask for prices so i could compare. When I called IGeek Tech I spoke with Hammad. He quoted me over the phone he told me the cost and said it could be done within the same day! His price was by far the lowest. I also told him about 2 other laptops that were just sitting around collecting dust and he agreed to repair all three for a deal. Coming from the pocket area I dropped off the laptops and he was nice enough to back up all of my data for free. Within the same day I received a courtesy call that all of my laptops were complete and ready to go. His service was 5 stars hands down and till this day my laptops are working perfectly, although I am not too worried because repairs by IGeek Tech are warrantied! Very glad I found this awesome company, will definitely refer this business.< /review>< response>

Please understand the iPhone was brought in with NO existing home button as the iPhone was severely damaged upon arrival.

<Review>My son just went to this location for gas, he gave the attendant $65.00 for gas, he was only able to put $57.00 worth of gas in, he went to get his change and the attendant refused to give him back his change, I want to call the police but I know that this is a low priority for them. Please beware of this location as they have unscrupulous practices!!!</Review>< Date>

Nice station that I used to frequent as a Chevron. Now it's a 66 and there's a $.10 up-charge per gallon using credit cards. That's an extra $1.50 per fill up for me. Cash?! Really?! Good luck. Not for me anymore.</review>

I was on a trip to LA from Australia, I had a punctured tyre on my rental car, the attendants and their mechanic were quite friendly and provided great service. They fixed the tyre and provided me a free coffee. Highly recommended!Thanks guys!</Text>

I'll acknowledge I am unusual in liking to refill my propane tanks rather than exchange them. I searched propane on Google this location came up 15 miles from home. To be sure I called and asked specifically if they refilled. "Ya sure come on down" and so I did. Unfortunately that person did not understand the question and so it was a disappointing trip.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

My car's Check Engine light was on, and i went for smog check to Doug's Mobil Service Center. First he informed me if they run the test it would fail. They did diagnostic test and fixed the problem with reasonable price. I am highly recommended for servicing your car.<//Review>

Apollonia Dental is fantastic.  Heather the Hygienist was super.  She made me feel relaxed and at ease.  I had to have a deep cleaning and she explained every procedure she was about to do.  She was very personable and we talked alittle about ourselves.  I like that.  Thank you Heather.  Very gentle and caring.</review>

I love Appolonia dental its my favorite!!! The girls in the front are always so friendly and helpful.  Dr Rafik is the best he answered all my questions from the start he is so nice and funny!  Elvira is so sweet she is doing all the final touches my implants fit so good. This week was my first time to meet Whitney the tech she did my cleaning. I am so happy with my implants it’s been a journey I highly recommend this dentist office it was the best choice I’ve made!!!< /Text>

<text>The Staff was very friendly. Ariana at the front desk was very nice and answered all my questions. Dr.Rafiki I believe his name was, was very understanding and explained things to me very clearly. Overall great staff. My only thing was I didn’t care for the set up of the rooms but regardless it was still nice.</text><gmap_id>0x80ea41a81bc6160f:0x780c2ae95c659ac2<//gmap_id>< userid>

I am always a nervous Nellie when it comes to the dentist but all the staff were very kind and Dr. Rafik was a nice and comforting dentist who explained things to me and extracted a tooth efficiently. For once I’m not (as) apprehensive about going to my next dental appointment. Inside is also very clean and well-kept and they take every safety precaution, which makes me feel better while we’re still navigating the pandemic.<//review>

The place seems okay,  the ladies are polite and professional. The $69 new patients is not correct, I was charged $79. The special is a basic cleaning not for a deep cleaning, which I need. Seemed like they where all in a hurry. Maybe when I get insurance and it covers the majority of the $1440 I was quoted then I can do another review.<//text>

Excellent and very friendly and personable staff. Dr Rafik is very skilled. While no dental work is completely painless, I have had a lot of dental work in the past and my experiences at Appolonia with Dr Rafik have been the least painful and most pleasant experiences I have ever had at the dentists office. Cannot recommend them high enough.< /Text>

<text>Dr. Rafik is very professional and polite!!! I am usually not a fan going to the dentist, but him and his staff had made it a more comfortable experience. He is a doctor with a lot of character who cares for his patients and works with you financially with payments-especially if you are someone like me who needed a lot work since I haven't been to the dentists in years. I am continuing to go there and will recomend it to anyone who has a fear of going to the dentist or even if you don't . Super nice staff👍</text>< Pics>

<Text>Typically I don’t do reviews unless I’m extremely satisfied and I am with Apollonia Dental, and Dr. Rafik!  The service here start to finish from thy entire team front office or back office here is exceptional & professional.  The office is always clean, a plus in these times we are in with Covi-19.
From young child trauma I don’t care much to go see a dentist. I’m sure lots of us can relate. Im a woman now in my 40’s a that had so much fear and anxiety of Dentists but since I started coming to Apollonia in 2018 based on online search , luck and a few good reviews I came here!  The first time I came here was to get an emergency cosmetic procedure to a chip on a front tooth, I received kind, reassuring  professional care , and fast same day appointment.  I felt at ease and their genuine care and  not only because I was a new patient but because you can feel that they love what they do. I was 😁 thrilled. Honestly, the energy , vibes were good.
It’s been three years now of returning for regular routine check ups and my fear or anxiety have diminished so much thanks to Dr. Rafik at Apolonia Dental. He is an incredibly dentist and amazing at his work, making you feel comfortable, at easy answering your questions but not only him but the gals there too.   The entire team there is awesome!
I have trusted them just days ago to do major cosmetic work that I would have never been able to consider nor would you pay me to sit at a dentist chair but the ease I find here, comfort and care I found it easy to get the courage to do it.  Throughout the whole process they made sure I was ok, giving me breaks , and each step they took Priscila let me know of what they’re doing. They kept me clean with all that was going on in my mouth and please believe it was lots in a visit but much necessary to do and who else to trust but no other than Apollonia Dental. Thank you for bringing back my smile 😁🙏🏽 I appreciate you all so much especially Dr. Rafik and his blessed hands. Thank you kindly.

<Review>Best dental experience! I had a wisdom tooth pulled out by Dr. Rafik. The process was so fast and painless. I was afraid of the process and kept putting it off because of all the horror stories I would hear. Dr. Rafik assured me I was in good hands. I did not swell or had to take any type of meds 🙌🏽. The whole staff in this office is exceptional! Extremely satisfied with their professionalism, care, and great customer service.< /Review><userid>105462680593993979238<//userid>< Pictures>

<Review>Mach 3,2021. I don’t write reviews but Appolotia Dental is the Best in Bakerfield. Starting from the time I walked in until I completed my tooth implants. Sarah and the front office staffs are the best in the business regarding customer service.  I give them 10+   Also Dr. Rafi is so funny and very professional regarding my tooth implants.  He makes it very easy and painless. His assistant Diana and Irish are awesome as well.  I will make sure all my staff members, Family and friends go to Appolotia Dental for service.   Thank you again Dr.Rafi

<Time>1614700089063<//Time><rate>5<//rate><review>I met with Dr. Joseph Marvizi and his staff.  The people there made me feel so comfortable from the time I got there until I left.  I had already started my upper clip-on teeth or OverDentures at another dentist.  I went to Apollonia Dental Center to finish up my dental implants.  Dr. Marvizi was so very helpful and explained the process, what needed to be done and how much it was going to cost me.  I was extremely satisfied with the price that I decided to move forward with my treatment.  The Staff was very professional as was Dr. Marvizi.  I would definitely recommend Apollonia to my friends and family.  Just for your knowledge, Apollonia Dental Center does NOT accept HMO's, only PPO's.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Quoted $20,000. For replacing lower implant.
Total rip off and attempted unjust enrichment
For minor work.  No lab on site.  Most work would be done dental technicians
Because I’m an attorney he thought he could charge exorbitant rate, and says it’s a discount
Implant specialist in LA quoted $5000.</Text>

First off, let me say I have a fear of dentists and have stayed away unless absolutely necessary for 25 years from a botched wisdom teeth job. I cant cant go in without something to help my anxiety, and I am a get your job done type of gal, and a mother of 4. Made an appointment because of a cracked front tooth. Knowing I needed at least an upper denture job, Dr R. scheduled the surgery, 12 upper teeth to be removed due to neglect, medication I must take. Told him I needed to be sedated for this job. He said we can't because of precautions taken due to covid, but here's what we will do and explained everything. Day of surgery went better than expected. Amazed he could do this work, with me fully conscious. Amazing dentist, amazing staff. He will be my dentist so long as I live around here! At follow up appointment, he anticipated all of the questions that I had. Go to Dr. R if you are in the market for a legit, excellent caring dental and staff.< /Text>

< review>
I just visited this office for the first time and my experience couldn't have been better! All of the office staff was extremely helpful, friendly, and very knowledgeable and informative. they took the time to explain everything that was going on; unlike some offices I've frequented before. Elvira was very courteous and checked up on me multiple times during my visit. You can tell she is very dedicated and genuinely cares. Priscilla was also very efficient every step of the way which made me feel comfortable and at ease. The office and bathroom is clean (which is very important!) and the entire staff really welcomes you in and makes you feel cared for. I'll defiantly be going back and would highly recommend.</review>

STAY AWAY FROM THIS FRAUD COMPANY!!! I went in for a basic exam which I was told was " completely covered," by my insurance at the time, yet a few weeks later I start being harassed via mail and phone stating I owe a balance. I explained my situation to the gal over the phone and she said it was "partially covered and still have a balance." This obviously isn't the first time this has occurred, if you read their REAL negative reviews. At this point, I'm having to go out of my way just to file a small claims law suit. Good luck if you bother with these folks!!!< /review>

I made an appointment and they were able to get me in right away. Candace the hygienist and another lady whom I can’t remember her name but they both took care of me in between appointments. They both took time to explain what they were doing and made sure I was aware of everything. You can tell that they truly value their clients and they genuinely want to help. I’ve always had awful experiences at dental offices but I actually felt comfortable each visit I had here. They have girls from their billing department go over payment plans with you after the initial appointment. And they’re also helpful and friendly as well. Eventually I do plan on getting Invisalign done here. It can be a bit pricey because insurance doesn’t cover everything but I do believe it’s well worth it.< /review>< user_id>

I'd have to say that I've been thru a lot of various Dentists and Dr. Rafiki is the best. I had heard about their service from a colleague 8 years ago and how great they were, yet I went to a competitor  a few years back for extensive work (which I still regret going there today)....

My Wife had a partial go bad and no one wanted to touch it. Or if they did they wanted 7k for 2 teeth, we called on Monday nite to see when they could get her in, on Tuesday she had her consultation and 8 AM they removed the broken partial, extracted a few teeth to include the ones that were causing her severe migraines due to infected, and she walked out with some new temporary choppers until her porcelain ones came in...

She has had nothing but awesome care from his staff to include Shea, and Elvira.....

Only bad thing is that their Office Manager is horrible about getting back to people, and thinks that she does no wrong... Everyone wants a title but not the Accountability..... if they could toss this bad apple I'm sure more people would bring in more referrals to include myself...

Thanks again Dr. Rafiki, Shea, and Elvira.< /text>

<Review>BEWARE OF THIS PLACE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME WITH THEM. I PAID THEM 4,800 FOR INVISALIGN AND I ONLY RECEIVED 10 OF MY 22 TRAYS  THEY ONLY PROVIDED TREATMENT FOR 10 OF MY TRAYS BEFORE THEY SAID I HAD TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL  1400 DOLLARS. I REFUSED TO PAY ON TOP OF MY CONTRACT AMOUNT AND I WANTED TO MEET WITH THE DR. THEY ASSURED ME THAT MY REMAINING TRAYS WERE SAFE UNTIL I COULD MEET WITH THE DENTIST AND WHEN I CONTACTED THEM BACK A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER. THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY THREW AWAY MY REMAINING TRAYS. THE GIRL TOLD ME MY CASE WITH INVISALIGN DOESNT EVEN END UNTIL 2021 SO WHY WOULD THEY SIMPLY TOSS MY TRAYS IN THE TRASH. THEY KNOW MY ADDRESS THEY COULD HAVE SIMPLY MAILED THEM TO ME BUT THEY DIDNT EVEN ATTEMPT TO CONTACT ME. I PAID MY CONTRACT IN FULL AND I RECEIVED ONLY 30 PERCENT OF WHAT I WAS OWED. HOW CAN THEY DO THIS TO PEOPLE. THE GIRL ON THE PHONE LEFT ME ON HOLD EVERY TIME I CALLED FOR 20 MIN EVERY TIME OR THEY WOULD NEVER RETURN MY CALLS OR VOICEMAILS. FINALLY WHEN THE GIRL GOT BACK ON THE PHONE AND EXPLAINED THEY DIDNT HAVE THE TRAYS ANYMORE SHE WAS RUDE AND DIDNT HAVE A  VALID EXCUSE FOR WHY. I AM GOING TO SEEK SOME SORT OF ASSISTANCE IN THIS MATTER BECAUSE I HANDED OVER SO MUCH MONEY AND THEY DID NOTHING TO FULFILL THE CONTRACT OBLIGATIONS. I WOULDNT BE NEARLY AS MAD IF THEY SIMPLY GAVE ME MY REMAINING TRAYS. I STILL HAVE STUPID CEMENT BUTTONS STUCK TO MY TEETH BECAUSE THEY NEVER COMPLETED MY CASE THEY DID THE SAME THING TO MY FRIEND.HER CONTRACT STARTED AS  . BEING 4,800 WHEN SHE WALKED AWAY SHE PAID THEM NEARLY 10,000 BUCKS. THIS IS NOT RIGHT I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU SAVE YOUR MONEY AND USE THE BETTER OPTIONS AVAILABLE .... APOLLONIA DOESNT CARE ABOUT PATIENTS THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT PROFIT . THEY DESERVE LESS THAN ONE STAR.<//Review>< Pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I am very happy with Dr. Marvizi and Dr. Rafik and their entire staff at Apollonia Dental. They make me feel so relaxed and at ease. They show that they care, like family.
Both doctors at apollonia not only specializes in preventive dentistry but they also specialize in dental implant oral surgery, endodontics and periodontics. So apollonia patients have no need to worry about being referred to a specialist because  both doctors specialize in all aspects of dentistry. And in most cases I find that rare.
I myself along with a lot of people dread going to other dentist, because we have to bite into these hard plastic cover bite tabs which is uncomfortable and sometimes painful. Apollonia offers high tech state of the art digital impressions and xrays which eliminates any discomfort and pain. Believe me I know. So the bottom line is I highly recommend Apollonia to everyone. The front office staff are like family. Especially Sara and Martina. The back staff like Elvira and Whitney maks me feel comfortable< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Smart, professional, warm inviting staff. Everyone who works there has treated us with respect and professionalism. We are so happy with all the services we have received at this office. We are high anxiety patients and Dr.Marvizi along with Whitney and Matilda all made us feel comfortable enough to get through all of our treatments. We will always go to this dental office.<//review>

<text>If I could give them a zero I would! Literally EVERY appointment I've made with this office they've had to cancel and reschedule because the doctors weren't available.
The front desk staff doesn't communicate with the actual dental assistants or doctor's, and the doctor ADMITTED this to me calling the front desk unprofessional and not organized.  I have one more produce left and then I will NEVER use or recommend this office.</text><response>None< /response><Time>1580845340369< /Time>< Pics>

I've been a patient of Apollonia for quite some time now. The staff is wonderful and the dentists are awesome. My husband and children are also Apollonia patients and feel the same way.  We never used to enjoy going to the dentist, but since becoming patients with Apollonia, we look forward to each visit. They're friendly, informative, accommodating, and they get you in at your appointment time and get you out in a reasonable amount of time so you don't miss any other appointments you may have. My kids have grown up with and  absolutely LOVE Dr. Rafik and Whitney for making them feel more like family and patients. :)</text>

I would recommend two improvements that would have increased my satisfaction.  There was a lot of waiting "in the chair" for the doctor to come in, and during all of this will be my kept me in a reclined position (which was very uncomfortable).  The staff member could've simply asked: "would you like to sit up while waiting for the doctor?".  Secondly, I had a deep cleaning, where they treat your gums with a laser.  My gums looked absolutely disgusting after the treatment, to the point where it scared me.  They didn't even tell me that my gums would look different for a little while.  Some simple communication would have alleviated a lot of anxiety:  "your gums will look gross for about a week".  If I would have heard this I would've been much better prepared to view my gums for the first time.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<pics>None</pics><Review>This dentist deserves a negative rating. They are a joke and they are rude liars! A billing factory geared to selling patients unnecessary services. Be careful when they lure you with services like a "deep cleaning" then bill your insurance company reclassifying you as patient with gum disease! Then you'll pay higher premiums for future services because of the this undeserving new classification they did not explain. Recently, I had the WORST cleaning and they told me they would not charge me. I could have got better results at home with my tooth brush. Upon leaving the office, they immediately billed my insurance company hundreds of dollars for a deep cleaning - so infuriating! I do not have gum disease and I'm now subject to higher dental costs and copay's! For several months they've been promising to rectify the charges with my insurance and even send me a letter of confirmation. All lies; an extraordinary amount of lip service, BS and inconsistent double talk! Now they refer me some unqualified secretary saying the previous managers I called are N/A? Don't be fooled by their kind demeanor as they lead you to financial slaughter and incompetent dental service.!!!</Review>< user>

<Review>I was recommended to Apollonia  from a friend. Not knowing what to expect I was pleasantly surprised by the professionalism & friendly staff. They all seem to go above and beyond regular customer care. I like the fact that all 3 of us can get  same day cleaning appointments all together for one trip. We just got my daughter Cassidy's braces on last month and she was scared at first but Elmer took great care of her. I would highly recommend Apollonia Dental Center to All!<//Review></record>

<rate>1</rate><Text>Last couple of years with my orthodontist and dental practitioners at Apollonia Dental weren't the best, the staff goes out of there way to frequently ask personal questions and honestly as a patient is very uncomfortable and unproffesional, my husband and I had addressed it with their supervisor in the past but it just continued on, so since I had payed the total amount of close to $8,000 i decided to stay and finish the treatment unfortunately. Staff not very knowledgeable but my ortho was always very curtious, I would not recommend this dental facility whatsoever not worth the money in my opinion. I'm very happy with my current dental practitioner and orthodontist.< /Text>< pics>

I consistently have a great experience everytime I come here which is often as I have Invisalign. Everyone — Dr. Soliman, Martina, Elvira, Jessica, Priscilla (I believe), Whittney, Denise (I believe) — is always friendly and kind. They always address me by name when I walk in as well as when I walk to the back. Compassionate, considerate care has always been exercised when I’ve been in procedures of any kind. It has always been evident that they genuinely care about my experience and the health of my teeth. Everyone also works quickly AND efficiently. I have appreciated the assistance of Martina and Elvira as of late. I have had to get a refinement for my Invisalign and they are covering the cost. To say that is a huge help is an understatement. It means a lot when everyone goes above and beyond to help you out in any way. The people at this office are actually some of my favorite people. They have a great thing going on. They’re a great team!<//text>

<Review>RIP OFF ALERT. TOTAL SCAM!!!! I got a postcard in the mail offering cleaning and exam for like $65. What a deal I thought and was very excited, thinking they are going to be awesome! I saw their reviews and saw that they give goody bags to their new patients. Boy was I wrong. I never got a goody bag and they totally ripped me off!! I usually get my cleanings every 6 months but the blonde-text-book-reading-hygienist was stabbing me in my gums, causing them to bleed. I said OUCH too many times while she rehearsed aloud what periodontal disease was. Uhh, I work in a dental office, I know what it means and I get my usual cleanings so I know I do not have it. So needless to say, the free cleaning offer did not apply anymore. The dr comes in for a quick second and looks at the x-ray of a tooth I was worried about. He says right away that it needs a root canal, even though the symptoms I was having were NOT of a root canal procedure! They had my treatment plan ALL wrong! He said I need a deep cleaning, root canal, and two fillings. Still charged me for the exam so I asked for my x-rays via email. The girl at the front desk was trying to tell me that she couldn't do that. I had to tell her that I also work at a dentist office and use the same program, YES YOU CAN SEND ME MY XRAYS VIA EMAIL.  So I took what they gave me and I went to Crown Dental for a second opinion and they said that the tooth doesn't need a root canal, only a filling. When I showed them the x-rays that Apollonia took, they said they could not even diagnose a root canal with that x-ray since it didn't even show the whole tooth! IT WAS CUT OFF. So they took new ones for me and were really nice about it. Crown Dental explained to me that the symptoms I was having was due to the fact that the root of my tooth was very close to my nasal cavities. I basically had ALLERGIES, NOT IN NEED OF A ROOT CANAL. Btw, I got my regular cleaning done at my usual dentist and both he and Crown dental agreed that I did not have periodontal disease!!! When I got my cleaning done, they found more cavities than just 2 that Dr. Marvizi found. My treatment should have been 6 fillings and 2 crowns. They could have had my business and my money but they were WAY OFF!!! WASTE OF $65 I HAVE EVER SPENT FOR "PROFESSIONAL" SERVICES. ALSO, Apollonia's fees are RIDICULOUSLY HIGHER than normal and DEFINITELY NOT WORTH PAYING FOR PROCEDURES YOU DO NOT NEED!!!
Bottom line is- I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DENTIST TO ANYONE!!!STAY AWAY FROM HERE! If you are looking for a reliable and professional dentist in this area, try Crown Dental on White lane and Ashe or Gosford Village Orthodontics Group instead!!! They both are very friendly, welcoming, and actually CARE about your oral hygiene.
DO NOT COME HERE FOR ANY OPINIONS, THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING!!!</Review><username>Emily Maldonado<//username>< Pics>

I have been with Candice for about two years, and she is awesome as a RDH. Her memory is phenomenal. I recommend this place to ANYONE. I hated going to the dentist before coming to Apollonia.

I had been going to this office before Marvizi Joseph took over. It was Dr. Neil Miliken the office was great exceptional went there for about 7 years. I lost my dental insurance so I didn't go for awhile. In November 2013 I went back the service was not the same. The dental assistant I had talked on walkie talkie the whole time I was there. She would try to explain things to me then a voice would come over the radio and she began talking to that person very unprofessional and rude. Suggested a lot of dental work I didn't even need because I went to Capitol dental after that. Apollolnia was price gouging me it was sad they don't care about patients any more they wanted their money up front no payment arrangements. She said, your situation is really bad and you need to pay this to get it fixed well Capitol dental gave me a different senario the fixed my problem let me make paymets. Apollonia worst dentistry in Bakersfield Dr. Neil would shutter if he knew how they were treating patients.</Text>

< Review>
Started off OK,  but they do try to sell you things you don't need.  They said I needed invisiline braces witch was going to cost $5000 over what my insurance covered...  Then they said I needed 3/4crowns on 2 teeth wich I am very suspicious if I needed those crowns at all....

My advice is be very cautious!!!!!!!!!< /Review>

Came in today, talked with a rep named Mark about my plan and the problems customer care caused on my account. Mark and the manager Jay were patient with all my questions and issues that I had with my account. They were able to break down the billing information for my husband and I. Great assets to the company, had a great visit to the store. I’m glad this store is still open.<//Text>

<Review>Took 2+ hours to set up ONE prepaid account. Absolutely ridiculous. Took up an entire afternoon, I can’t imagine how long it would have taken if I had a complicated problem.< /Review>< username>

I came in to switch from my past provider since AT&T plans seemed more reasonably priced. Sophia was very knowledgeable with plan details and made the process seamless. I will continue to visit this location for future service needs. AT&T,  Sophia is an asset to your company.</Review>

<Time>1609799234709< /Time><review>I started working with them when they were still at westlake and unfortunately it has been horrific since day one.  I was with Verizon and very content, however I decided to buy my husband the new 12pro and was lured in here due to the “great” promotion.  My needs did not matter to the sales rep and I was fed a bunch of promises just to get me to sign up.  A week later when I found out I was lied to I tried to get out of it but by this time it was too late as one of our phones has been already traded in.

When I asked for it back, I was told “sorry, we already sent it out but you are welcome to buy yourself another phone, try ebay” what a joke, the phone we traded in was worth $800 and was only a month old.  It has now been two months of trying to resolve things, more lies have been fed to make us happy but in the end the truth always came out.

Seems like the moto here is “promise everything to get the customer” When bringing this up to management it made no difference. I’ll be counting the days when we can switch back to Verizon.</review>< Rate>

Horrible experience at AT&T Stownstown Galleria in San Francisco. Worked with Gladys and Iviz for several hours to buy 3 new iPhone 12 Pro Max phones and port/transfer phone numbers from Verizon. I handed them a sheet that detailed each phone that I wanted and the phone numbers that should port with. Took about 3 hours and had to stay 30 minutes after store closing. I was rushed out. When I reviewed the work they did a couple of days later, I found that they set up each port number incorrectly along with one of the numbers not even being mine. I went back to the store and was advised that issue is no longer their problem and I should just call customer support. One can imagine how frustrating and insulting to hear that coming from the store manager (I do not recall “his” name). I decided to call customer service while onsite. I sat on hold for about 1.25 hours, finally got connected with an agent and was disconnected. I left the store furious. Gladys, Iviz and the store manager, would not stand behind their shotty work nor even attempt to fix it. I complained to corporate about them and they gave me a credit of $250 for the horrible experience, time wasted and delaying the overall process. I would not suggest working with these people… STAY AWAY for your own sanity.< /Review>

<Review>I have had the best experience here. I have been with AT&T for a long time. Recently I went to Stonestown to upgrade my phone and the staff there were super helpful. Payne and his crew were very attentive and had answers to all my questions. My family and I ended up going there 3-4 times and every time it was A+ service. Will continue to shop here. 😃 A+++</Review>< Response>

Alex was so patient and understood my issues. She was thorough and made me feel confident that my issue was resolveable. I had talked with tech support the day before and they informed and assured me it was a SIM card issue and walked me through the process. Alex reached the SIM card and worked wonders to get phone back to "normal". She's a keeper for sure.< /text>

I was blown away that he wasn’t a manager, he’s so professional!! We both had accounts with Sprint for 16yrs each, they had horrible customer service in the mall, and online and on the phone. They lost us as customers. We both purchased the IPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, and Brian sold us on switching from Comcast/Xfinity to AT&T. This is my first review ever, that’s how great our experience was. We’re really grateful he made the switch so easy, thanks Brian! 🏅 I should also mention the manager was really great, too. He values his employees. Thank you gentlemen!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1582156931701, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback.'}< /resp>< GmapID>

My daughter and I went in to the Att store at stones town. Leslie helped us. She found all kinds of errors on my bill. She fixed it, got us credits, showed us the Apple TV and we bought it. She could not be nicer or more informative. If you go to Stonestown, be sure to ask for Leslie.<//text>

Don't expect a box for your anniversary gift you spent a $$$ amount on. Went to pick up for my wife and the lady brought this bag out.
I asked her if I could get a box, she said that's the way it comes. I thought Nordstrom had good customer service.  Won't be shopping here anymore. Off to go buy a box.

<Text>I ordered online to save $10 on a pair of sneakers for my son's birthday. After a few days, was notified they had arrived, so went down to the mall and discovered that they had sent the wrong size. Instead of acknowledging that they screwed up, I was told that they (of course), weren't in stock, nor would they check any other location for inventory. I had to accept them and go to the return desk in order to get my money back. After painfully waiting in a huge line, I was able to get refunded. One positive note - The suggestion to check online for them was good, as it gave me something to do during the hour i waited to return the wrong sized shoes! Never going into their store or shopping on their website again, due to this fiasco.< /Text>< Pictures>

Nordstrom Review

Nordstrom is Nordstrom. I like to call it my one stop shop. Always a great selection and quality. You’re Definitely My Favorite and 1st. choice! 😁

Management is quick to respond when something goes wrong. Mr. Hector in the men’s department felt the need to harass me about my mask not being up to par. It wasn’t quite covering up my nose. The first time he asked me to pull the mask above my nose. I said yes and did what I thought was appropriate. He then said the second time. “more” Pull your mask up more! My response was, I already did and continued to shop. Then he felt the need to continue harassing me
about my mask. Obnoxiously loud and disrespectful. My composure is still the same as when I walked into the store.

I am  one of very few independent Homeless and Elderly Advocate. Very patient too. Not limited though. I provide Instant assistance for the ones in need. No matter what the situation becomes. I believe in FAIR and I stand very firm with that. I also believe in equivalent or better! So when someone or business even corporation decides to  taking advantage of someone. Well... That would be when I step in. BUT most importantly Nordstrom! I treat them All with respect and acknowledgment of existence! They are human too! Please Help someone every now and then! Donations of any kind would be extremely helpful Nordstrom.

No matter what I may inherit on their part or the amount of time I will spend. I never ask for anything in return. It’s my honor to provide if I can. Some Individuals really need help. Reason why I provide only the Best! They deserve quality too!

To have Mr. Hector respond towards me in the manner of clearly unprofessional, unacceptable and just ridiculous!
I definitely demand respect at a minimum. Give me a break Mr. Hector! Please focus on having a lot more respect for others. Need some advice,  please don’t hesitate to ask me personally. 😊

The Store Manager Kimber Handle the situation correctly and I appreciate that. You personally gained three stars back!
Great Performance! 😁
Thank you again and see you soon.

<Text>Great selection of high quality brands. The line for returns though. they really need to put more than two people to help out with returns when there is 10+ people waiting. Other than that, I like shopping there.<//Text><GmapID>0x80d95519a9fe69b3:0x3ee2d61fe93ea06d</GmapID>< UserId.>

As places are opening back up, Nordstrom manages to keep clean and even with larger lines, they move quickly. Always enjoy a nice day out shopping here.<//Review>

I am sorry to write its name as Rack Store earlier instead of Nordstrom
Rack Store. One of the best store I always buy every thing from
this store.</Review>

Customer service here is so poor. the lady who cleans the restroom makes everyone wait, 10 people who have to use the restroom are waiting and she’s cleaning as she’s talking on the phone. It’s a weekend and it’s busy, they need to reconsider another contractor to clean, get rid of the current cleaning person. Management seems to no care and they just proceed and turn a blind eye. Shows you how unreliable management is here.< /review>

Nordstrom Rack in Mission Valley is bigger and better than the others in San Diego and has an extensive shoe selection. Pricier than Marshall's or Ross but it more than makes up for that in selection and quality. Tommy, Hilfiger's mens cologne was on clearance for $11 for a one oz spray. Vince Camuto Capri rollerball parfum on sale for $7. Those were the best deals that day. I found a soft gray thin Status sweater for $6 and a black hoodie for $10 in the clearance rack. I paid for my purchases, hàppy to leave with 4 good quality items for about $37..<//Text>

Was about to buy some Gucci shirts and was asked twice to put on a mask. Then I was asked to out a mask on while standing in line. I had been in line for about 10 min at that point. I was almost to the register and security asked me to put on a mask. I Walked out. Won't spend my money with your store. BYE</Text>

<name>naman pandadiya</name><Text>Really great store! The store is well organized and even have a express checkout lane for 3 items or less! The shoe section is surprisingly organized and I see staff constantly checking the shoes and finding matching pairs which can be a huge hassle! There are clearance sections and a big mark down section by the shoes with many things such as underwear,socks, small garments and etc.. really great mall and amazing nice staff!</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMANgIn26Zpz_TNk0hijq9KnvOYRR6qM4c7Or2X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrItLEP_lhDTNT33b1K49UYLJVBoj_JWDy3K7e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKKCFnaQ7qa739-pH38en6HTt5PeRYz7hS0G7q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqUNfV_HpX0biM9Ok8yYoRFu1SLO-Fl_iIjCvZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGXgkTu6Cvq9V2uM1hfhP2U5dSbP2C3gxHBLm3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGeVf_qYG6WfPvHKJhfq-gTZYclViIsrWEozOY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNq4NmpyRGSBKcyYBZJ3frzvAYgWLNsOCFRNL2m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg-rJVXnVn3b9Lj6WcFkmClLFLAa0eFAgP-eJb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM16FyD6ReTzaJqsLMFe-efZUx0nubGpDxHyZek=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNY07edSCsjLor3B60BBBhuV83aHcywuNDVqCJI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlZAdmarfr4zTA4QHTJU3YKM_Wu3xdJRQgJGzX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2NtkQfohJ2PuOL3Bj2kyW90G2F5OQ79wx2gTv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9uKf0E72S8vez01bcL9FBNhkwsGi6unhHvPVj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP79toC2Qlv-4jOURTLEDFjtDVW5KJRK-w79xqO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWfvdAxrgfK2ROxAA9xdYnVQSzVDMV_O0f2w9r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM017SWlxUsXVrLJ7PbvVr7vIZWORXbmy9um-N0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< time>

The store was kind of a wreck which is surprising considering how expensive most items are. They have a lot of cute stuff and it is less than at Nordstrom store but still pretty pricy if you ask me. I did notice that the purses were actually marked down quite a bit.</Text>

Must wear mask at all times, no temperature checks, love this store! Fully stocked, lots of sizes, beauty, home, clothes, shoes, kids, bags, electronics for everyone in the family. No lines going in and no lines at checkout. Social distancing and all checkouts wiping before next customer. 5 stars</text>

I have a medical reason and a note from my doctor that states that I am unable to wear a mask. I waked into the store wearing a face shield and was told that I was required to wear a mask. I told the security guard that I was unable to wear a mask due to a medical reason and I was not permitted inside the store. This is discrimination and it should not be permitted. I have spent a considerable amount of money at Nordstrom Rack over the years and I will not ever return to this store.< /review>

They do have good selection. I just wouldn’t recommend placing an order online and having it shipped to Nordstrom Rack Mission Valley for pick up. My paid in full order had said it arrived at the store on October 21, I went to the store to pick it up and they said it “hadn’t gotten there yet”. It’s now Oct 24 and they still claim it hasn’t gotten there although the email days ago said it was delivered to the store. At this point let’s just face it, my order is lost and they still have my money.< /Text>

<Text>1) Order pickup notification came in Dec 1 and have 7 days for hold. I went on the 7th day and order was already canceled/returned!!

2) inefficient and unsafe. Retail store is mandated to have capacity. The greeter/counter at the door is the same person assisting with order pick ups -so between counting customer who comes in and goes out his attention is also diverted to talking to customers and looking up their orders. Capacity count is compromised and doubtful on accuracy even as an estimate. Store can get crowded and risky.< /Text><response>{'time': 1609521596001, 'text': "We're sorry to hear this was your experience.

I like Nordstrom Rack primarily because it carries a wide variety of shoes in my size, 11. For ladies who have bigger feet, the sizes go up to 13. That said, the store carries a large selection of clothing and other items. I love this store.</review>

Came here the first day they re opened from COVID. First I just want to say thank you to the awesome employees for working these crazy days. I’ve worked in retail on crazy sale days and I know how over whelming it can be. The employees were very friendly and even chatted with me while waiting in line.  Very organized and I must say the wait was worth it! I got some great things<//review>

This rack has lots to choose from. Good jeans selection. I found some True Religions here originally $199 for $80... But the next week I discovered True Religion had a black Friday sale and clearance and the exact same jeans were around $50.... So I'd say, unless there is an amazing sale elsewhere, you will find pretty incredible prices here. The lines are long, though, and dressing rooms can get crazy.< /review>

Yeah really good I was looking for a pair of sneakers for work. I usually go to a Walmart or Burlington spend 30 to 40 dollars ,shoes are never right and only last a month. I only expect them to last a month. I got a good pair at the nordies rack ,that were solid and fit like a glove . The materials in the shoe was worth the extra 20 bucks . The line was long but moved quickly</text>

I love Nordstrom Rack. This is the only location I have been to but I always have a simple time finding what I'm looking for and then some. When I transitioned into an office job this was my first stop to develop an appropriate wardrobe and it was such an easy experience. The store is well organized and the dressing room is large enough to accommodate the usual crowds. Customer service is great every time and handled even the holiday rush with finesse. I am glad to find quality items here that last at a decent price. I recommend it to everyone I know and I hope they remain here for many years to come.< /text>

The best rack I have ever been to. Lots of good quality and fair priced woman clothes. I got some nice pieces from rag and bone for very seasonal price. It’s during their remodeling time but still everything was under well managed.<//text>

Hours listed are currently incorrect, I drove down there and the security guard was extremely rude when I said, "Oh your hours online say that you are open for another hour." She flatly said, "Well, they hours online are wrong. And we're all going to have to be here until 10pm cleaning everything up" and turned her back to me. So... call before you go!</review>

Plus sizes run large. I pulled pants to try on in size 20 and tops in 3x. Went home with size 14/16 and large or 1x tops. Decent selection. Must have patience for sorting through racks.< /review>

As others mentioned - THE BEST RACK YOU CAN ONLY GO TO. Huge selection, prices are amazing but their shoe section is out of this world, every single time I come in - leave with at least one pair of shoes even if I don't really need them, because you can't beat the price. Wonderful place.<//review>

<text>Store is a mess during the remodel.  They don't care about their male customers.  3 tiny fitting rooms with almost no privacy, and they have completely gotten rid of the male restrooms during this time.  Not even gender-neutral facilities.  Only women's facilities.  Way to go Nordstrom Rack.  Highly dissatisfied and disappointed.</text>< pictures>

<text>Love the rack as always. Very crowded store and quite messy, but we were there on a lunch hour so not sure if that's why.. Great deals and huge variety of clothing and accessories and shoes. Quick checkout stands to pay with card make it an easy purchase. Always pleased with Nordstrom Rack!<//text>< Date>

<Text>Good stuff is all about and incredible prices.  If you have not been to The Rack, you do not know what you are missing.  They have all the name brands you will find at their main store, Nordstroms, but at a fraction of the price.  Give it a run, you won't be disappointed.</Text>< Rating>

Generally very friendly and helpful staff here, and located right next to a parking lot for easy access. I always love 'treasure hunting' at The Rack!!

Pro tip: if paying with a card, skip the line at the front and go to one the the associates at the smaller desks throughout the store who can check you out from there!</Text>

< review>
Went in about an hour before closing looking for shoes about 10 min in needed to use the restroom and there was a cleaning bucket blocking the door to the men’s room but obviously nobody was cleaning the restroom so as the member of the green team watched me walk away I asked “I said so how long does it take for the restroom to get cleaned” she looked at me like I was trying to sell her life insurance and very confidently said “ I don’t know “ and abruptly walked away with absolutely no intention of finding out or caring. All the employees there looks rather annoyed for some reason don’t know why and at closing time Almost an hour later the bucket was still blocking the entrance to the restroom door. So I took my $120 Bruno mollies and set them back on the shelf and left. I wanted to take my Piss in the shoe and stick it back on the shelf but that’s just not my style. Not allowing customers to use the restroom for a department store is about as low brow as it gets I would expect that from a shady pornographic selling smoke shop in the ghetto but at nordstroms?come on guys you’re better than that. And yes not allowing customers to use the restroom is a reason to get a low score especially when they’re willing to drop 120 bucks on something you have on the sale rack.</review>

Don’t buy at this store. Mom (elderly) bought me blouse at this store (too big) didn’t want to exchange because mom threw away receipt. Cashier extremely rude and unhelpful. Shame.</text>

Always something new to find at NR. The store has rearranged the mens section to start on the far left of the store and runs parallel to the back of the store that ends by the restroom. Newest fashion for all seasons and also keeping around classic staple pieces available. Work-out gear, standard blue jeans, dress clothes, ties, dress socks, ties, and lounge wear are all available. Price points are fair for any kind of budget - a favorite for shopping in SD.</Review>

the actual store didn't have much, everything was clearly overpriced and I could have gotten the same items for a lower price at another store but all of the employees were very sweet and helpful. I recommend this place if you are just looking around. don't go there for a specific item because you probably won't be satisfied< /text>

You can forgive the line to pay if you find great stuff. Tip: there is often a quick line that pops up around the store, where people in green t-shirts will check you out if you're paying by card. Just please don't take too long!</Review>

I really do love this place but it has started to become tacky. When you first walk in all of the glasses are just so messy. That's the first thing customers see when they first walk in, it should look presentable. The shoes can be really messy as well.<//review>

Good selection of clothing at of course a discount. Customer service has been very good overal including finding different sizes if you can't find it yourself as they have the ability to search on their computers to see if it's in store vs other like places I've been to.< /Text>

Usually has a good selection of items at reasonable prices. However, the store is often in shambles which makes is challenging to locate the items you're looking for. Staff are usually bogged down with tasks so they aren't readily available to assist customers.<//text>

<Review>Store appears to be organized, and most of the employee are helpful...
But unfortunately the one thing that stands out the most, and keeps me from wanting to come and shop here is the 30+ min wait in a line that wraps around the store to check out...
They don't have a separate line for returns, so this causes an even longer wait time, dealing with return issues!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<pics>None<//pics><userid>107200985787778339829<//userid><review>My biggest problem with Nordstrom Rack is not what they carry...its just trying to find it all in this madhouse. There are lot of items to choose from, but its seriously like a scavenger hunt trying to find things in your size without searching for an hour. Then there is the issue of the checkout line always been long. And finally, the mess. This store is just like a litter bin. Clothes, shoes, items are all over the place - shelves, racks, the floor. Don't get me wrong, you can find some good stuff here. You just have to be there for quite a while before you can get to it and get it out of the store.< /review><rating>3</rating></record>

<text>Store appears to be organized, and most of the employee are helpful...
But unfortunately the one thing that stands out the most, and keeps me from wanting to come and shop here is the 30+ min wait in a line that wraps around the store to check out...
They don't have a separate line for returns, so this causes an even longer wait time, dealing with return issues!</text><Time>1489166485787</Time><gmap_id>0x80d95519a9fe69b3:0x3ee2d61fe93ea06d< /gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

I can tell this place has cute clothing for a good price. BUT it is far too stressful to shop here. Random clothing is just thrown everywhere and the store is MASIVE. It also appears that they need more cashiers because when I went the line to check out was at least 20 people long.<//Review>

My biggest problem with Nordstrom Rack is not what they carry...its just trying to find it all in this madhouse. There are lot of items to choose from, but its seriously like a scavenger hunt trying to find things in your size without searching for an hour. Then there is the issue of the checkout line always been long. And finally, the mess. This store is just like a litter bin. Clothes, shoes, items are all over the place - shelves, racks, the floor. Don't get me wrong, you can find some good stuff here. You just have to be there for quite a while before you can get to it and get it out of the store.< /text>

I had some extra time during a recent lunch break, so I wandered into the Nordstrom Rack at the Mission Valley mall. This store was a mess & the line is always long, so I haven't ever had the chance to buy anything. Their prices seem reasonable but it's difficult for me to get past the messiness of the store.< /Text>

It was crowded,  but I had no problem parking,  and the checkout line was short.  The only downside is the staff cannot keep things in order as fast as the shoppers can mess things up.< /text>

Most the luxury brands they have are Size L and XL. They need to have different sizes. They also barely have luxury brands like Versace, Y-3, Gucci...etc and if it happens and find something you like it will be xs or xxl.<//review>

Probably the cleanest Rack I have been to. I was impressed at the organization of everything. Other Rack's remind me of Ross at times which is frustrating. I was pleasantly surprised by this location.</text>

I signed up for a Nordstrom debit card they attach to my bank account. They must have entered the wrong social security number when they created my account, so after making a $400 purchase I wasn't able to earn the points toward my reward. I'm upset because had I been a thief I don't really think I would care about earning points to get a reward. If I were a thief I would just be concerned about swiping somebody's card to get out with the purchase. This is the second issue I've had with this store, where a whisper of common sense would have saved me a lot of heartache and inconvenience.< /Text>

I am a frequent Nordstrom & Nordstrom Rack customer. Both this location and many others. Today's visit was inconvenient and frustrating to say the least. First our dressing room experience - greeting by an associate with a bad attitude who suggested maybe we try on some button up shirts from the hanging rack so we don't have to open up any new ones. (We had already checked the hanging rack for coordinating shirts btw). His general attitude continued this way throughout our time in the dressing room. Un-helpful suggestions for the sole attempt to make his job as easy as possible. As we later continued to check out we hopped in an express checkout station with only one customer currently being checked out. Their signage reads to use express check-out for, I quote, 5-ish items. We had 7-10 clothing items neatly organized and ready-to-go. The associate asked how many items and we said 10. She then said we'd need to go to the front for that, so we made our way to the line of 15+ people. All of clothes fit in one medium sized bag. Not sure of the exact policy since the sign says "5-ish" but I think it would have been pretty quick and easy for the young lady at the express station to check us out. We spent 2+ hours in the store today in exchange for poor customer service and a sub par experience.

UPDATE: To start, again, I love Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, but at this particular location, customer service is just not high on the priority list. This time I couldn't take all my belongings into the dressing room, which is totally fine, but I asked if there was somewhere to put the others until I'm ready to switch out. The young lady says, "Not really but you can park your cart over there." I asked if all my things would be fine there, to ensure no one would just walk up and start browsing in my cart. She says, "Well I can't really guarantee anything but that's where everyone parks their carts." Cool. If there's no method for taking in a certain number of items in the dressing room and being able to switch out then either their shouldn't be a limit or there should be signs everywhere that say you can only take in X amount of things to the dressing room and they have no where to put the others so don't shop for more than that.<//Text>

<Text>Who doesn't love Nordstorm Rack? My husband, that's who. This place takes a portion of my paycheck every month. Beauty produce, high-end labels, purses and shoes galore. You can get it here at a fraction of the price. The lines can get pretty long here, but the staff is great about being as speedy as possible. The inventory is constantly changing. I got a Rebecca Minkoff purse here for just $90.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

< Review>
This is my favorite place to shop and I come here a lot, primarily because I can get in and out using the green check out lanes. Today, I found out they changed their policy and have limited those lines to 5 items or less. The checker refused to help me because I had too many items and said I needed to wait in the regular line which extended to the back of the store. I left without purchasing anything. I'm extremely disappointed, No wonder brick and mortar retail is dying.<//Review>

Haven’t found much in this store. The racks are too crowded together. The children’s shoe aisle is a mess. Not too much designer shoes in the section.</text>

Nordstrom's quality at high discount prices. Gets a little crowded at times, so if you go there either be patient or maybe have a plan to do something else else if it's a busy time.<//text>

It's not like it used to be 10 to 20 years ago. The store is too crowded with clothes and the staff​ is not as professional as they once were. Not as helpful. I think all they have time for is just putting all those clothes back on the racks.< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The store is located in a commercial pedestrian street, with a large area and a wide range of goods, from cosmetics, school bags to clothing, shoes and hats, and the discount is also great. If you happen to have your own number, it is very cost-effective.

店铺位于一个商业步行街内，面积很大，商品琳琅满目，从化妆品、书包到服装鞋帽都有，而且折扣力度也很大，如果碰巧有合适自己的号码，还是非常划算的。</Text>< Pictures>

<user_name>AO HI</user_name><review>(Translated by Google) If you come here after seeing a luxury brand in the fashion valley, it's cheap at a level where you can relax. The inside of the store is clean and high. I went there many times while living. In addition, I bought a gift card at a physical store and paid for online shopping because Creca in Japan could not be used.

< text>
(Translated by Google) I toured all of the Nordstrom Racks surrounding San Diego and this one was most disappointing to me. Not the staff, who are always incredibly friendly and helpful (if only it could be so pleasant in France 😇), but the men's department clearly disappointed me. I think this should not be their main sales because it is the one where I have seen the least, but ladies do not hesitate to go there you will be delighted the choice is not lacking for you.
Another regret: the fast checkouts weren't open (none across the store) and quite a few people were waiting at the checkout, perhaps to be changed in the future.

(Original)
J’ai fait le tour de tout les Nordstrom Rack environnant San Diego et celui-ci m’a le plus déçus. Non pas le personnel qui est toujours incroyablement aussi aimable et serviable (si seulement ça pouvait être aussi agréable en France 😇) mais le rayon homme m’a clairement déçus. Je pense que ce ne doit pas être leur principal ventes car c’est celui où j’en ai vu le moins, en revanche mesdames n’hésitez pas à y aller vous serez ravi le choix ne manque pas pour vous.
Autre regret : les caisses rapides n’étaient pas ouvertes (aucune sur tout le magasin) et pas mal de monde attendait en caisse, peut-être à modifier à l’avenir.< /text>
