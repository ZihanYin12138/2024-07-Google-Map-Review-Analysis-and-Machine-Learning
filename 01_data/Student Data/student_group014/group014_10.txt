<Review>I love abandoned places and taking cool photos. It's private property so please be careful and respectful if you're looking for some adventure. This place was up and running in the 1960's, and, in it's hayday during the 70's and 80's; the best around for the area; the Marshal Scotty's Amusement Park.
But, now as an abandoned amusement park it's great for a Halloween scare as the haunted park comes alive. Make sure you visit at least once!< /Review>< date>

if you're in your mid/late 30s or better you for sure remember marshall scotties... well its not exactly like you rememeber it, but the iconic items like the roller coaster, ferris wheel, bumper cars and the buildings are still all there. However, they've been repurposed in a haunting fashion. The haunted amusement park is a trail that snakes its way through the majority of the park and has plenty of people working the haunted attraction to make sure you keep your guard up. The decorating, lights and theme are well done and its definatley something that you need to experience for yourself or better yet with a friend. Part nostalga and lots of haunted fun.<//Text>

<review>These guys do such a great job year after year!  Highly suggest going with the VIP fast entrance when lines get longer, totally worth the incremental charge.  The photo option at the end of the trail is also recommended.  Can't wait to see them again!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Our first time here for the haunted trail and we loved it!  The trail was fairly flat with fun twists, turns, dark rooms with strobe lit hallways and creepy walks through the trees!  Loved all the variety of characters who scared the four twelve year olds with me.  Definitely will come again!< /Text>

I’ve never had a problem with anyone there and provides an amazing place to have fun, relax, and release some energy. I’ve never gone through it myself but I’ve heard from many friends that it’s the scariest scare trail in all of San Diego. Can’t wait to work there again!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

This is by far the scariest haunted house I have ever been to! The line to buy the tickets took about 10-15 minutes and then my husband and I spent the $25 each to be able to move straight to the front of the line which was great cause the line is very long. the walk-through takes about 15 to 20 minutes and the entire time there are people jumping out at you chasing you screaming at you and scaring the living life out of you. I literally had to change my pants at the end. It was fun but I wish I would have taken a Valium before hand because it might have made it just a tad bit more enjoyable cause I might have been able to keep my eyes open< /Text>

The childhood memories of visiting Marshall Scotty's makes the scare trail that much more fun! They keep you moving in order to get people in and out quickly as the lines are very long getting in. Fun for all ages.</text>

The kids had a lot of fun, but we decided to discontinue that program and do a direct fundrasing event on the opening weekend.  This year we will be teaming up with Team Parker 4 Life to help end Childhood Cancer.  We hope you can make it!'}<//Response>< username>

<review>Today 6/24/2021. We me and my father in law traveled from Arizona by vehicle, which is an 11 hr drive one way! Arrived @ the San Francisco Honduran Consulate @ 4:45pm. We asked for some service and almost got rejected. But the woman said we had to come back on the 3rd of July, 2021 to make an appointment. This experience has been very unprofessional. This woman was rude and said without looking at my fathers paperwork that she cannot help him get his ID or passport. And this woman had the audacity to say when I asked for her supervisor or someone above her position, that their WAS NO ONE ELSE ABOVE HER!! My question to anyone out there please help me find out who her boss is or can I contact of Vice President of the United States of America. Kamala Harris. This woman who runs the Honduran Consulate is very much out of Control.. Something needs to be addressed to the correct Authorities.. please help me with a phone number or email address of this Consulate of Honduras Higher up Management or Supervisor or California State interiors office phone number.. I want answers before I leave with my tail between my legs. Thank you some much<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rate>

<review>Did anyone ever get the contact information for the supervising officials of this SF Honduras Consulate Office?  Yesterday we were advised that in order to renew an expired Honduran Passport (expired March 2021) you must present a valid Honduras Identification in addition to a birth certificate and the expired passport.  We had the expired passport and the valid birth certificate, a current green card and valid CA drivers license.  The clerk insisted that a valid Honduras ID card is mandatory to recieve a salvo-condutos to complete my travel to Honduras and renew the passport while there.  I explained my flight was scheduled to depart last night.  That did not matter.  Admittedly I inadvertantly allowed my passport to expire.  I maintain weekly contact with all my family in Honduras.  However, I am only able to travel home 1- 2 times every 5 - 7 years for 2 - 3 weeks.  I have resided in the US since 1987.  Why or how would I have a identification issued in Honduras.  Has anyone heard of this?  The other option was to bring a 3rd party into the SF consulate that had a current Honduran ID and passport that will swear under oath to my identity as a Citizen of Honduras and to my actual person.   It will be practically impossible to renew my passport under these restrictions.  Any help or suggestions greatly appreciated.<//review><Response>None<//Response>< user_name>

<rating>5< /rating><review>(Translated by Google) June 23,2021. I went to the Consulate of Honduras in San Francisco CA, for the second time, I did a consular procedure (AUTHORIZATION), with a PREVIOUS APPOINTMENT as REQUIRED, take all the documents that the system gives when you finish filling out the form with the data they ask for. I arrived at the Consulate at the peak time of the Appointment, they treated me very WELL, the Consulate staff were very polite, very professional and very quick to do the procedure, the system they have with social distancing was very orderly; I am very happy because this is the second time that I have had to go to the Consulate of San Francisco and they treated me the same !! I am sure that if we all comply with the steps required by the Consulate, our procedure in place will be pleasant! Thanks.

(Translated by Google) The people who worked there believe the CONSUL and they are simple boot licks, it is identical to being there .. they have the same service .. It seems that one reaches them to ASK and they are not because because that is their DUTY to attend .. for that They pay them. They cater to those they want, to whom they do not put a thousand obstacles ... and badly educated the sour!

<Review>(Translated by Google) THE TRUTH THAT THEY DO NOT ATTEND WELL TO PEOPLE WHO NEED CONSULAR SERVICES, WHEN YOU SPEAK, THEY GIVE YOU AN INFORMATION AND WHEN YEGAS IS ANOTHER, THEY ARE VERY ANGRY TO ATTEND, THE PREVIOUS CONSULATE WERE THE SAME, THEY DID NOT HAVE CHARISM, and the only thing that changed was the place Where did they move but they always give the same treatment, I don't know why the consulates treat people so badly

(Original)
LA VERDA QUE NO ATIENDEN BIEN ALAS PERSONAS QUE NECESITAMOS DE LOS SERVICIOS CONSULARES, CUANDO HABLAS  TE DAN UNA INFORMACION Y CUANDO YEGAS ES OTRA ,SON MUY ENOJADAS AL ATENDER ,EL CONSULADO ANTERIOR ERAN IGUAL NO TENIAN CARISMA ,y lo unico que cambio fue el lugar a donde se movieron pero siempre dan el mismo trato nose porque los consulados tratan tan mal alas personas</Review>< gmapID>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I am trying to make appointments online and they do not send me the confirmation to my email, how can I make sure the appointment is made? (At the end of making my appointment it says "Your appointment has been created successfully") but they do not send confirmation to my email that says it has to be and print. I would not like to go for pleasure, make my daughter miss classes and miss a full day of work. Please any answer? I will introduce myself soon, but I'm going to bother if I'm going to taste like losing work at all. I am nervous!

(Original)
Estoy tratando de hacer citas en linea y no me mandan la confirmación a mi correo electronico, como puedo asegurarme que la cita está hecha? (Al finalizar de hacer mi cita dice "Tu cita ah sido creada con éxito" ) pero no me mandan confirmacion a mi correo que dice que tiene que ser e imprimir. No me gustaria ir por gusto, hacer faltar de clases a mi hija y perder un dia completo de trabajo. Por favor alguna respuesta? me presentaré pronto, pero me voy a molestar si voy a puro gusto perdiendo de trabajar para nada. Tengo nervios!</Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) I do not understand why on the page they place as a requirement to present only a birth certificate to be able to take out the passport and at the moment that one presents even preentandola they want the mother or father to be the applicant being an adult ?? And the person who attended unfortunately does not know the name of the woman does not seem Honduran because instead of helping one complicates it, not because of that great service 👏 with only that neither the telephone number put on the page for one to be able to do any question .. There is no doubt that it is still a garbage.

(Original)
No entiendo porque en la pagina colocan como requisito presentar solo una acta de nacimiento para poder sacar el pasaporte y al momento que uno se presenta aun preentandola quieren que vaya la mamá o el papá siendo el solicitante un adulto?? Y la persona que atendió lastimosamente no se el nombre de la mujer no parece hondureña porque en lugar de ayudar se la complica a uno, no pues que gran servicio 👏 con sólo que ni el número de teléfono ponen en la página para uno poder hacer alguna pregunta..  Ni cabe duda que sigue siendo una basura.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) This is a shame, nobody updates information in the office or on the website. To go to get my passport I had to go everywhere from how to pay for the shipment. Nobody gives a complete information to one before going. There is not a cell number there and neither general where one can ask questions if you have doubts. My friends from other countries take everything very easy every time they go to their consulates. Then I go for birth certificates and they told me at the office that they do not give there and that I have to wait for the Mobil consulate to go to Las Vegas NV or ask for them from Honduras. It's ridiculous.

(Original)
Esto es una vergüenza, nadie actualiza información en oficina o en la página web. Para ir a sacar mi pasaporte tuve que ir a todos lados desde como pagar-asta el envío. Nadie le da una información completa a uno antes de ir. No hay un número de cell de ahí y tampoco general donde una pueda hacer preguntas si tiene dudas. Mis amigos de otros países optienen todo bien fácil cada ves que van a sus consulados. Luego voy por actas de nacimiento y me dijeron en la oficina que no ellos ahí no dan y que tengo que esperarme el consulado Mobil que valla a Las Vegas NV o pedirlas de Honduras.

<Review>The most excellent Salvadoran food. 👌  Not the best ability to give good customer service. Did not honor the call in to have the food made. I came about 25 minutes after calling in the order. I paid for the food and was told to park in a specific place and he would bring the food to me (8 pupusas) in 15 more minutes. When the 15 minutes were up I got out of the car and went to ask about the order. As soon as I opened the door he said your order will be right out in 5 minutes. I told him that's why I called ahead of time. He didn't answer anything. Went back to the car and he brought my food in about 7 minutes. I feel mistreated. I'm not going back. Pupuseria Sabor El Salvador thank you for the time, in the past that you gave me good customer service. Good bye< /Review>< Resp>

I celebrated my birthday earlier this evening in this delicious restaurant. I am glad to say that it was a fine evening and the place was definitely the reason for that successful evening. The waiters  cooperated in a pleasant manner, the cuisine was appetizing and my friends were extremely  happy. We shall no dout visit again for more events. thanks very much.<//text>

The food is very good. Reason for not giving it 5 stars is the customer service over the phone. The man that answers the phone hung up on me and said he couldn't take my order since I was a new customer. Over all the food is very delicious< /review>

The pupusas are a good size an a good price as of this post. You can call in your order and it'll be ready for you in 15mins! They have a small dining room area that can get full when busy. They have some good traditional Salvadoran sweet breads. Parking can be a bit difficult as its only street parking. You can use the lot next door but only for a quick in n out since its not designated for them. The location is not the distinguishable either so it can be easily missed. But overall a good bang for your buck. Give them a try!<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHiDUR2IVDjSYuqwJJYLfqaiAZ_u3o39t-iesA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYQlahlfLHgidsDNx8nkGNrP-YGn8i3qJLDIFj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

I also tried their empanadas de leche and omg they were probably the best ones I've ever had. The service was great, the man who took my order was very welcoming and friendly.

Didn't even let me finished my sentence.

This place is a joke. The person answering the phone is really rude. I was trying to place a order so I wouldn't wait and he said they don't take phone orders and hung up. I called back and he use profanity and laughed. How are you a business. I would give it negative stars if I could.</text>

The platains are pretty good. Its a quiet restaurant. Not a lot of selections on the Menu though. They only have 12 different foods. They specialize on making Salvadorian food only. As far as their service they attend really good and fast.</Text>

This place is so bomb 😻 but advise to order through phone going in since everything is freshly made it takes a min. But nonetheless amazing 😉<//review>

Everyone has their taste buds and experience this one was mine definitely do not recommend I’ll go early to Pupusas Lemus</review><gmapID>0x80c2cb0bb5e4ff29:0xf52e0336ebbe7630< /gmapID><user>118016229972677153891</user><username>Dulce Soria</username></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Best pupusas in town!! They're really affordable and taste great. I recommend the chicharron w/cheese and the mixed ones. The only down side is the limited parking. They have aguas frescas and sell freshly made bread too! Lots of tables to eat with your family. Tv's are on while you enjoy your food.<//Text>< Rating>

The second you meet Marlina the owner you will know what I'm talking about ! Her food reaches truly refined levels of texture and flavor! The tamales are the best I've ever tried and omg the breakfast on weekends is the bomb!! I love this place and would come from far far away to eat this wonderful wholesome delicious food. Her agua Fresca is also the best I've ever tried along with fresh orchata and fresh  Jamaica - I get the large large orders to last all day for my whole family ! If you want to eat and feel so good eat here often you will love it !!</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very good flavor, to take away in this pandemic but they charge for a sachet of sauce if you want more for your pupusas, I miss when I had the little sauce bottle and I put it to my whim, now I order 4 pupusas, a small sachet of sauce and if I want more, I have to pay extra, one tries to support the locals but it even takes away one's desire

(Original)
Muy bien sabor, para llevar en esta pandemia pero cobran por una bolsita de salsa si quieres más para tus pupusas, extraño cuando tenía el botecito de salsa y le ponía a mi antojo, ahora pido 4 pupusas, una bolsita pequeña de salsa y si quiero más, tengo que pagar extra, uno trata de apoyar a los locales pero así hasta de les quita las ganas a uno< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) The pupusas are very good but the attention that the cashier has for the clients is very pedantic and sarcastic. One asks him something related to food and he comes out with his bad comment so it takes away the desire to hir to consume his food. he tries to be nice but it doesn't make him feel bad they have a zero grade another day I went to pick up some pupusas to take away and told him q if he could give me another disposable plate because I wanted to eat one and he said q no q if he wanted it it cost .25 cents and as I wanted it I paid him that is not done it is supposed that you are consuming my way that you eat it in your hand

(Original)
Las pupusas están muy buenas pero la atención q tiene el señor cajero para los clientes es muy pedante y sarcástico uno le pregunta algo relacionado con la comida y sale con su mal comentario así le quita las ganas a uno de hir a consumir su comida..trata de ser amable pero no le queda lo hace sentir mal a uno  tienen cero de calificación otro día fui a recojer  unas pupusas para llevar y le dije q si me podía dar otro plato desechable x q se me antojo comerme una y me dijo q no q si lo quería costaba .25 centavos y como lo quería le pagué  eso no se hace se supone q le estás consumiendo mi modo q te la comas en la mano</text>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>(Translated by Google) I could give you less than one star. The service was appalling. The way my family was treated is outrageous. Unfortunately I don't know the names of the employees. The man who is a cashier, did not bother to say good afternoon. When we asked for the order he mentioned a 40 minute wait when there were only 5 people in the restaurant including my family. We preceded our order, the Lord did not take note of anything until I had to repeat my order multiple times. When he stressed again that the wait was no longer 40 but 50 to 1 hour, we asked for our order. Then he suggested that we could search online for restaurants similar to yours and go to one of them as another option, in other words he meant “if they don't like it, they can leave”. Understanding that working in a restaurant is complicated and at some stressful point, does not justify these facts. I know this incident could only be something at once. But I do not recommend that place. Readers, and owners of the restaurant, improve their methods, and their employees consider them to be friendlier.

(Original)
Le podría dar menos de una estrella. El servicio fue pésimo. La forma en la que mi familia fue tratada es indignante. Desafortunadamente no se los nombres de los empleados. El señor que está de cajero, no se molesto en decir buenas tardes. Cuando pedimos la orden mencionó una espera de 40 minutos cuando en el restauran solo había 5 personas incluyendo mi familia. Precedimos a pedir nuestra orden, el señor no tomo nota de nada hasta que le tuve que repetir mi orden múltiples veces. Cuando nos volvió a recalcar que la espera ya no era de 40 si no de 50 a 1 hora, pedimos nuestra orden. Después nos sugerio que podíamos buscar en línea restaurantes similares al suyo e ir a alguno de ellos como otra opción, en otras palabras nos quiso decir “si no les gusta, pueden marcharse”. Comprendiendo que el trabajo en un restauran es complicado y en cierto punto estresante, no justifica estos echos. Se que este incidente pudo ser sólo algo de una sola vez. Pero no recomiendo ese lugar. A los lectores, y dueños del restauran, mejoren sus métodos, y a sus empleados consideren ser más amables.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The pupusas were very good flavor but the tanning and the sauce if they occupy a little more flavor. At least for me if it tastes good only for me it's not to my liking I think I got used to the tanning and traditional sauce that does not sting.

(Original)
Las pupusas estaban bien buen sabor pero el curtido y la salsa si ocupan un poquito más de sabor. Por lo menos para mí si tiene buen sabor solo que para mí no es de mi agrado creo me acostumbré al curtido y salsa tradicional las que no pican.<//Review>< pictures>

In and out quickly
Everybody masked
Never had to get out of my vehicle
Clean shop
Friendly enuf pros
A little pricey @ $90 for oil chg but worth it overall considering their safe practices, and it's my first one this year....no mileage being one of covid's many (non-coughin-non-coffin)silver linings (cough).</text>

I went here for the first time on Saturday to get an oil change.  There were three other people waiting, but my car was ready in about 15 minutes.  Seating area is large and comfortable, and staff was super friendly.  They explained everything they had done and I was on the road in no time.<//Review><user_name>Ami Anderson< /user_name></record>

The mechanic who checked me in as well as the one checking me out seemed very distracted. Best example is that after my car was done and out, they asked me if I wanted to perform the extra work they recommend. Usually, they discuss it while the car is in the bay.</Text>

Brought my son's Subaru in for an oil change. In and out in 15 minutes. Best price and service I've gotten in a long time. Only annoying thing was the whining guy with a huge pick up complaining about the fact he had to pay more cause his engine took 11 quarts of oil.</Review>

<review>Had a light go out and showed up half hour before they closed, one of the guys (don’t know his name) hopped right on the job and had me out in 20 minutes, week later my oil light came on and since I had such wonderful service I decided to go back instead of using a coupon for another oil change spot, again had me in and out with great service. Will return again!<//review>< Time>

I cannot stress enough how terrible my experience was at this SpeeDee Oil Change location.  For starters, the inside of the waiting area was just as hot and humid as outside. No AC for customers? Spare every expense.
As he drove my manual car into place, I could hear him revving the engine and grinding the clutch. Then about five minutes later, the serviceman comes inside and asks me to come out and look at the engine. He tells me to check out the power steering fluid and how dirty it is, and then compares it to a fresh bottle of fluid. He says "normally we charge $80 for the service, but I'll give you the late afternoon special of $60 since we're already doing your oil."
I tell him no, I only want my oil and filter changed. Very shady behavior.
When they finish changing the oil, the man gets back into my car, starts to back up, then barely rolls forward and immediately drops the clutch from a standstill. My car lurches forward and does unseen damage to my clutch and transmission. I ask the cashier behind the counter "Does that man know how to drive a manual car?"
She ignores me for a few moments while she talks to the servicemen in the shop and after a few laughs with the other gentlemen, she turns and says "oh yeah he can drive."
Clearly not.
After they "finish" my service I present a coupon for $29.99 full service. She then tells me the total is over $42.00. I ask why and she says because my 2004 Mazda 3 requires a special type of oil filter. It has never required a "special" filter.
They pull my car forward and say "thank you, take care." I step inside the car and the floors are even dirtier than when I left the car there. I ask "do you guys clean the floors or no?"
(One of their inspection points is to vacuum the car floor. Says right on the coupon I presented and everywhere else on the website.)
The same man who dropped the clutch in my car says "oh sorry, some of our guys went home early so we're short handed."
There was no one else getting any type of service done, and over four men standing there.
He vacuumed the car and I drove away.

"Professional Oil Change" could not be a more inappropriate way to describe their service.< /review>

Yes, they often try to up-sell you by saying things like "Have you thought about replacing your air filter?" (even though it's fine) but if you can see through that and say no then you should be fine! Again, good price, quick service.<//Text>< Pictures>

Super slow for SMOG checks. They quoted 20-30 minutes. Took them an hour. No one was in front of us in line, they just prioritize oil change over SMOG. They got mad at us when we asked if there was an update or if we could have our car back. Oil change has been fine, but don't come here for SMOG.</review>

Excellent, quick and honest service. They're generally a little more pricey than other quick-service-type places, but there are always discounts available and the people there take good care of your cars. They'll take the time talk honestly with you about your vehicles, which can be very rare among these types of services.<//text>

It took me 5 minutes of pointing to my owners manual to convince them they were wrong. Then they tried to tell me i have to tell them which oil i want when i check in.  5w30 is not 10w30. duh
I couldn't believe how hard it was to get them to put the correct weight oil in.
I will never go there again and will always recommend against Speedee oil service</Text>< pictures>

This place has been great for YEARS! and now the new owners are only adding to the success! The pricing is reasonable, and the quality is phenomenal. Not to mention the newer additions to the menu are great. Wether you are buying for the family or just need a quick bite you'll be satisfied.< /Text>

<Text>Some of the catfish I ordered was not done and I paid $65 for all the fish I bought catfish was too big and it was fried too thick that's why I didn't get cooked but the filet of sole was okay I think the grease was kind of old though because it had a black girl old taste to it but other than that we ate it also I Give It 2 and 1/2 Dawn's up next time I know it'd be better<//Text>< username>

If you love "Bad" crude, rude, insulting service from the owner who acts like she's doing you a favor by offering you a teeny, tiny cup of hot sauce to go along with the high priced, lack luster, half the portion size fish you ordered then this is the place for you. The owner talks down to the customers not to mention the fact that there is "NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!.....what's really sad is, I continued to keep coming back for more food. Well today is a new day, for me. I will no longer complain about the horrible treatment, and I will no longer continue  buying the food. Owners like this don't deserve my Business. If you can't show "your customers respect", then you don't deserve they're business. The Best way to send a message to people like this is to "STOP SPENDING YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT PLACES LIKE THIS PERIOD"! I sure will.< /Review>

There was a bag inside of my dr.pepper. The bag that the cups come in was stuffed inside the cup. The person I spoke with the next day gave me a refund and my daughter a milk shake. Still though, with COVID being a thing, who knows how many people touched that bag before it wound up in my drink. Yes I drank from it before noticing the bag. Gross. I was supposed to hear from the general manager. But I haven’t.<//text>

Always great service here.

I wish the company would send coupons to the 92570 ZIP code since we have a Wienerschnitzel nearby. You guys need to fix your website too. Every time I click on an email for coupons, the site makes me fill out a form to be a new lover. Then no coupons.</review>

<text>Horrible service. Drive thru staff doesn't verify if your order is correct for one. Then you get the window take your card and end up charging you for something you never even asked for. To top it all off, they handed my receipt with no card. What BS is that?!? Stayed 5 minutes there waiting for them to even look back out the window and for me to tell them they forgot to give back my debit card. Plain and simple, if you hate your job don't work. Taking my business elsewhere.</text>< username>

The first and only Wienerschnitzel in Perris. Really nice staff and Manager. The food is freshly prepared and quick. Try the shakes. They are a must. Can't wait to go again with the kids.<//Review>

<Text>Very first time I have tried Wiener schnitzel. Drive thru service was fast. I ordered the pastrami chili fries and they where so delicious. Good amount on the pastrami. My husband ordered a pastrami sandwich and he said it was bomb. Also ordered a soft served icecream and it was a nice amount on the cone. We're definitely coming back to this location.< /Text>< Pics>

Whoever was the girl (receipt said Zoey S.) on drive thru at 7:50pm taking orders was so rode. She made us feel dumb and small, cutting off what I was asking. We also asked a simple question at the window of she could make our food crispy and she said she can't because the line was long. She also then made us wait in the parking lot which made no sense. She didn't say a word when she gave us the food in the parking lot and just stormed away...i never felt so belittled...< /text>

Had a very disappointing visit, trying to introduce my gf to this place, we went drive threw, she was driving so I gave her money to pay and got 6 cents back without her counting it cuz we "trust" them so we left not knowing we were short some money we didn't recieve back from our order and before exiting from wienerschnizel I went back in threw drive threw to talk about the change I didn't recieve and asked if we can please have the rest of the change they didn't give us because we only got 6 cents back so I went back to ask for my money and they "counted" the registry and said they don't owe so I nicely asked if they can count it again, same response, "we gave you the change" and I explained myself and they said they did protocol and I asked if they can please check the cameras and kept insisting and the manager said they did so I asked if I can verify the camera to see if they gave us back money and the manager lied to my face and studdered and said he did not knowing he said that they only checked the registry. Anthony whom was the one who didn't complete the change was the one who recieved me and did not give me back my change, in accident I'm sure of and I forgive him but not the franchisee and the way they handled us. They did not do what was correct and I'm very sad and disappointed that I did not get my money back. I asked for a refund from how disappointed I felt and discussed and  told me they can't do that. Bad management skills, protocols, and they didn't even check the cameras. Only the registry but I'm sure they did that bad to as they had so many cars going threw that I'm sure they mistakenly counted the money wrong from how much activity was going on. I than explained I wouldn't waist my time nor theres for no reason but an ethical one. They are not Ethical. I'm to honest and very humble for these people to steal from me like I didn't earn my money. So sad and disappointed in this franchise. Than got home to our cold food with no working microwave from trying to defend ourselves. Please work on this franchise and resolve problems, don't create them.</Review>

Decided to try the pastrami fries, wish I hadn't. The pastrami had no flavor the fries had no salt and way too much mustard was put on for the 2 strips of pastrami used. I'll still eat there just won't ever get those fries again.</Review>

The owner is very sweet, offered us some samples and watched us as my friend and I walked into our vehicle. He even let us stay after ours to wait for our ride. The beer was delicious and it was a cool place to hang out and meet some people.</text>

The two girls that came for styling hair and makeup the morning of my beautiful bride friend's wedding were awesome. They had more than a handful of bridesmaids and one stunning bride to doll up, and they flawlessly put on our makeup and did our curls as a team.

Pictures were beautiful and everyone felt lovely all day, thanks to Rosie's professional work! They worked fast and were really sweet and friendly too!< /review>

Huge selection of local beers that you can enjoy inside the dimly lit bar or sit outside by the huge water fountain on their patio. No food, just beer and some wine. Great happy hour prices and friendly staff! It's 21 years or older so no kids allowed.<//text>

Definitely a place to check out if you're a craft beer lover. They have a great variety of beers on tap, from basic lagers to interesting and unique sours, and even an occasional cider or two. The bartenders are very nice and will pour you tasters until you find exactly what you are looking for. The building is clean and they have a nice patio space outside right next to a fountain, perfect for cooler days and evenings.</text>

We recently went to the vault and grabbed some food and drinks. My husband and I did a happy hour at home and the growler and blueberry daze were delicious paired with some wings and mozzarella sticks. The kids enjoyed the Mac and cheese bites. Just what we needed for a night in.</review>

<Text>23 rotating beers on tap, primarily local Nor Cal beers. No food, but they do have some restaurants in the area you can grab food from. Good vibe, love the outdoor seating area, especially that they allow dogs out there. They are also 21+ so it's a nice adults-only vibe.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOw9YxBeKiqFhWo4EhC8wqGlNmQOikd5b3GXsa7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTP5sqauPvLazVuUbW6FbGiTlw-XJ7wkwwTnwq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< date>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I’m rating the establishment 5 stars. I genuinely enjoyed my experience at the Vault. I was welcomed in and served a few tester beers to find what I liked. The bar tender gal was nice. The beer selection was outstanding and quickly satisfied the all of us. The only minor detail that kept catching my attention was the owner that was acting as a hover parent over the bartender. In my opinion, the bartender can and will do her job without supervision. The helicopter parent owner needs to back off...all the way off. I suggest he just joins the crowd or go home.<//Text>< Name>

I attended a very pleasant and lively cocktail party here. Very much enjoyed the attempt to create a local "pub-like" atmosphere! It's clearly a nice place for the neighbourhood to pop in for a cold beer and some chat. The service was friendly and eager to assist although, amusingly, completely flummoxed by my husband's request for a club soda and lime. It was, as if, they had never heard the words "club soda" before -- odd for a place devoted to adult beverages! But, no matter! A good time was had by all!<//text>

<Review>A great place to go and relax to drink some good craft beers. The people here are really friendly offering that neighborhood feel. You can sit inside or outside. The craft beer selection is great and always changing due to the wide array of breweries it has to choose from. A fun way to spend some time out with good friends or go it alone and find some new ones.</Review>< userid>

We went here to try the craft beer. Taste was good & the ambience of the place is also fantastic.  Staff were very friendly & polite. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the beers he was pouring. We'll definitely go back here to have a few craft beer next time.<//Text>

<Review>The Vault is a great place to grab a beer and visit with friends.  The atmosphere is down home and really welcoming, the people working the taps are knowledgeable about all their beers and make it a great experience trying new things!  Highly recommend a visit.<//Review>< pics>

<text>A disappointment. There's no fun here.  A bar that lacks a personality.  We went after work on a Friday. The bartender who appeared to be the owner hovered over a sweet gal pouring us a beer with a scowl on his face.  Not so much as a hello or welcome.  The attitude appears to have permeated the entire building as the atmosphere was dead. We drank our beer and left as quickly as we arrived. Can't imagine this place being around long unless they make some changes.  Many other better options nearby.</text>< Pictures>

<text>If you're only looking for beer, this is a good stop.  No food, which is why it can't earn 5 stars in my book.  But they expanded the number of taps they have and the bottle collection is solid and updated.  Taps don't rotate as fast as Boneshaker, but they usually have good stuff and the owner is a nice guy.  They have WiFi and a fairly nice patio if you want some fresh air.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x809b2225104b3c4d:0x7ce397c77a6af9a4< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>A little pricier than other brewers in the Roseville/Rocklin area, but very good selection. Highly recommend to people who don't want to go out of their way to the local breweries like LBB, Monks, etc.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

< review>
Tall kid with glasses was not very helpful - no greeting and actually gave me the up and down look when I walked in.  I’m female and a minority soooo instantly, I knew this wasn’t going to  be good.  I was going to buy a heavy item, and I asked another worker if I could leave it on the counter so I can move my car closer and I wouldn’t have to carry it very far.  He was kind enough to let me.  But when I came back, the tall  kid had put it back in the aisle.  He told me things “couldn’t be left on the counter.”  Wow.  2 stars for the other employee who was actually helpful!</review>

<review>Independent stores apparently don't take returns from other Ace stores, especially this location (although nothing posted anywhere says that). Very unhelpful staff and wondering why they use the corporate Ace name when they don't even honor the returns policy. Better off going to Kingsbury hardware and supporting nice, helpful local people that don't hide under a corporate entity.</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>The store is centrally located.  The service however leaves a lot to be desired. I asked a question about plumbing and the person who is supposed to be knowledgeable could be bothered.  I will try not to return to that Ace unless I absolutely have to.  Very unfriendly.  The reason I gave it a 2 stars is because it was clean.<//Review>< pics>

This place has great selections for basic project materials and the staff is always pleasant and very helpful.  Prices are a bit higher than the usual but that's what we pay for convenience.  Still very fair though.  Justin is always helping the best he can and greets everyone that enters the store.  Big plus for customer service.< /review>

I was about to buy a 100 dollar item and the cashiers unprofessionalism made the excuse it was due to health codes. We were nowhere near others and I would have left the area if patrons were checking out. This respsonse was rude and unexplainable. I attempted to reason with the cashier to no change in situation. I left and eill take my business elsewhere. Your other staff are wonderful which is unfortunate because one bad apple ruins it for all.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x809990769e79bd13:0x411dcc2c6f46f0f5</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I've been twice to get some help with a simple plumbing adaptor and washer to fit that adaptor.... I've now talked with 2 different employees who not only did not help, but they just pointed to a rack of hundreds of adaptors and fittings, one of which might work... I've now been back and forth to this store 3 times in 2 days and still did not end up thru guessing,  a proper adaptor and washer to go on our toilet... I'm not a plumber, in fact I'm probably an anti-plumber, but ACE advertises a helpful store where you can rely on good advice...  I've been offered no advice at all, and left to my own best guess each time I talk with someone here at this store...  I also live in Paradise, CA  and that ACE is completely different and they are helpful, so this must be a very bad set of employees who can care less about their customers...</review>

Most appreciative of the excellent service when I needed to buy snow chains. Morgan came out to the car to ensure inspect the tyre size of my SUV. She researched the tyres to check it's mud and snow rating.  Morgan you're the best! I'm so grateful for your help and advice!!👍👍👍

<Review>Needed special plumbing parts for a serious rupture in a 3" PVC pipe. Called 10 minutes before closing and was told they were closing.  I described our needs and asked them to hold the door open. They welcomed us and had the parts we needed.  There supply was wide and plentiful as we needed three special coupling/sleeves to stop the leak.

A great asset to our community.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I have come to love this place. I get their Singapore Noodles every week. Staff is friendly. A bunch of folk I know have had other dishes and speak well of them, but I just cannot get enough of the Singapore Noodles. They also make their own hot sauce. Can vary week to week, but is always most excellent. Highly recommend.</Review>

<Review>Best Chinese in Santa Rosa. Hands down. Everything is fresh...like REALLY fresh... veggies, mushrooms, etc. All their sauces (lobster sauce, sweet/sour, ginger) are light and flavorful. Our go-to picks are usually the mixed mushroom entree, the shrimp and peapods in lobster sauce, ginger beef, and mooshu anything. Nothing has the super fried/deep-glaze stickiness a lot of other places have. Just fresh yumminess.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

This place is super plain jane chinese food. No real wow factor. Didn't necessarily feel welcome either. Super rushed. Before I finished my plate and drink, she already had the check stting in front of me, even though it wasn't even 6 o' clock yet. Didn't tell me goodbye or take care or please come back and see us or nothing. Definitely not coming back< /review>

<Text>Great tasting food, all of it! I did not feel like it was even remotely greasy or overly salty. Anything fried is very crispy and not overly breaded or coated, and most importantly don't fall apart. The flavors were really balanced in the sauce coatings as well. I've actually never had sauce-coated dishes that came out crispy before at other chinese places I've been in the past and thought that was the norm (lol), so this was a first! Not a frequent american-chinese food eater in general, but this makes me feel like I should be because it is so good.  Service is friendly also.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808447fdd20e33fd:0xdffcdabbcd1ec699<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Metered parking always sucks, but the food was worth it, this is a gem for quality Chinese food, fresh and cooked just right. The restaurant was clean and the staff was prompt and courteous.  This is the best tasting Chinese food in Santa Rosa.
5 stars for the food and service 1 star for the noisy chap behind us.<//Text>< pics>

Came here for Valentine's Day dinner with my wife while visiting from North Carolina. From the very first bite to the last you could taste the quality in the obviously fresh vegetables.  There didn't seem to be an overwhelming taste of sodium in their food which made the taste that much more enjoyable. The staff was courteous and friendly and made the whole experience wonderful.   We're definitely coming here again before going back to N.C.!<//Text>

Try the po po platter appetizer as a meal alone or to share beef skewers, chicken wings, pot stickers, egg roll, foil wrapped chicken (2 of each treat). The won ton soup was very good, again all fresh ingredients nothing frozen and not over cooked.</text><Rating>5< /Rating><userid>105354089727115841205</userid></record>

<text>Wonderful food! Tofu Miso Soup, tofu with shiitake mushrooms and spicy string beans were made to perfection! String beans were slightly crisp, just the way I like them, and the shitake mushrooms were seasoned beautifully, were moist and absolutely scrumptious. Great service, couldn’t recommend more highly.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I have been coming here since 1994, one of the original places left on 4th street. Great lunch specials. Been ordering the chow fun for ever!  Only thing is I don't like they're chicken, it's fatty. But the rest of the items on the menus are awesome &  yummy!!<//Text>

<text>This is fabulous food. I don't know what their takeout is like but they're eating food is marvelous. Another nice plus of the place is it's quiet, as restaurants go, bucking the trend of cranking up the echo chamber such that we have to scream across the table to have a conversation. And I'll repeat, lest it's not clear - the food is terrific, it's fresh, well-prepared,  beautifully served.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I have been going here for years and always loved it until recently. There are new waiters and waitresses who provide terrible customer service. On Valentines day my boyfriend and I waited at least 5 minutes before the waitress brought us a menu and then we ordered spring  rolls but she brought us egg rolls. I kindly said something about the mistake but she just kept saying that they were spring rolls. She also never did a check in after serving us our food. Then today my boyfriend decided to give it one more try. We walked up and both signs said open but when we walked in the waiter at the cash register said they weren't open. I said both signs say open and he condescending replies yeah well we're not open. IF YOU'RE CLOSED WHY DOES YOUR SIGN STILL SAY OPEN?? Food is still pretty good but definitely gone down in quality.< /Review>

<Text>One of my favorite chinses restaurant! Whenever i find myself in Santa Rosa I make sure to stop by for a meal. They cook with a sense of pride in what they are serving you. Kindness in the staff and chef comes out in their meals. Wonderful lunch specials and we always are taking some of their fine food home for a mate snack.< /Text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) I did not expect to have a very authentic Chinese food in this small town. When I first came in, I thought it was an American-style Chinese food. I ordered the Mongolian cow and the woody meat. I ate it quite authentic! Highly recommended! The boss is very good.

没有想到在这小镇上还有挺地道的中餐。刚进来的时候以为是美式的中餐，随手点了蒙古牛 木须肉啥的，一吃还挺地道！强力推荐！老板人很好。< /review>

Interesting market with a large variety of Russian/Armenian foods and other European imports.   Lots of dumplings, sausages, a good assortment of beers, a large array of fruit compotes, and lots of different German egg noodles.  There's also a butcher area with fresh meat and fish, but I didn't explore it on this trip.</Text>

Great place for different kinds of Russian food. They have prepared food and refrigerated food as well. They also have fresh fruits and vegetables. They have a huge selection of candies, chocolate, sweets, etc. This is also the best place I found to buy Russian dumplings for the cheapest price. The staff is nice and the selection is big of many different things but with more focus on Russian tastes.</Review>

The store lacks in service. The meat department guy is extremely rude and unprofessional. A very “kyartu” environment that makes shopping unpleasant. Management needs to ensure the staff address customers politely. He had no manners and is a rabiz guy from yonj@lax or charbax with very low IQ and thinks he is some gangster from 1994 era. Shame on you and those that pay you. Will not recommend going there.</Text>

Awesome place to get popular russian and other Eastern European products. One of the largest stores like this in Los Angeles area. Located in a not very visible building. The entrance is on the back of a warehouse looking building.< /Text>

I bought a cottage cheese and it was frozen !! as a brick. The expiration date tags look like replaceable easy to peel it off and stick another one. This store is taken off from a previous century. Never again. You'll never find a store like this in East Europe very bad experience, sorry to say.</Text>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>Inexpensive and loaded with interesting foods from across the Eastern European region. I also like the butcher, who sells all manner of beef, chicken, sausage, and some prepared salads. Definitely worth a stop if you're wanting to stock up on wine and other liquors - their selection is great and their prices are lower than one usually finds.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c295b6d57ba683:0x446e58a33a8a47f7<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is a large, Costco-like Russian food store. They have a huge selection of liquor lately, way more than is warranted in my opinion.
The prices are good and the selection is very attractive. I shop there rarely - the location is not very convenient.< /Text>

<Review>Great prices and the biggest Russian/European foods store I've ever seen. Wait until you see the entire room of sweets and candies! Everyone is friendly and I love to chat with deli ladies. If you get a loyalty card, you earn points towards "cash back" to spend in the store. I mean, cmon, what's not to love?< /Review><user>112728893522497934530</user>< Response>

<Review>Probably the best grocery store specialized on Russian food. They have very big choice between a number of quality food - sweets, caviar, frozen foods, marinates, milk products. Very big parking where you can always find a spot. After we discovered this shop, all other Russian food shops in Santa Monica were forgotten.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I think it's the only east-european supermarket in Los Angeles area. I've found everything I wanted.
The selection of goods is similar to that I saw in Russia or Poland. The prices are much lesser than in regular small stores, I think because of quantity of sales. Very helpful staff.</text>

You can find many national products, if you miss your homeland - that's the thing😜 The child was presented with toys at the checkout😀 Well done guys 👍🏻 Service 💯 I recommend !!!

Отличный магазин, большой выбор продуктов из СНГ (каши, пряники, сало, конфеты, печенье, торты, минералки и многое многое другое...) Можно найти много национальных продуктов, если соскучился по родине - самое то😜 Ребёнку на кассе подарили игрушки😀 Молодцы ребята 👍🏻 Сервис 💯Рекомендую!!!<//review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) The largest "Russian" store / hangar, corresponding to the assortment plan, it has no equal. In terms of finished food loses "grandmother" and "rasputinu."
For fruits / vegetables lose "olive fresh". They make shish kebab to order, heard that bread is baked with you, prices are slightly higher than in other "Russian" stores.
There is a department with medications symbolic.
Well, cold, so dress warmly before you go)

(Original)
Самый большой «русский» магазин/ангар, соответственное в плане ассортимента ему нет равных. В плане готовой еды проигрывает «бабушке» и «распутину».
По фруктам/овощам проигрывают «олив фреш’у». Делают шашлык на заказ, слышал что хлеб пекут при тебе, цены несколько выше чем в других магазинах «русских».
Есть отдел с лекарствами символический.
Ну и холодновато, так что одевайтесь потеплее, прежде чем зайти)<//review>

(Translated by Google) Great supermarket. A very large and magnificent assortment of goods, with some types of goods, it is impossible to buy anywhere except here! Prices are almost like everywhere else, but for some types of goods, cheaper. Always fresh red caviar, excellent salting and cheaper than in all stores that sell caviar.

(Original)
Прекрасный супермаркет. Очень большой и великолепный ассортимент товаров, причем некоторые виды товаров, невозможно купить нигде, кроме, как здесь! Цены, почти, как везде, но на некоторые виды товаров, дешевле. Всегда свежая красная икра, прекрасного посола и дешевле, чем во всех магазинах, которые продают икру.< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) They sold the old caviar. And they don't want to change - they said that we don't have air conditioning in our car (that's why the red caviar was gone) has anyone heard this ???????? (this could only be invented here)
Can anyone explain what's going on in this store?
And this is not the first time that a product is not fresh (purchased from this store)
Pacific Food management - don't want to change customer service policy ????

(Original)
Продали старую икру. И не хотят менять - сказали что у нас в машине нет кондиционера ( по этому красная икра пропала ) кто нибудь слышал такое ???????? ( такое могли придумать только тут)
Кто нибудь объяснит , что происходит в этом магазине ?
И это не первый случай не свежего товара ( купленного в этом магазине )
Руководство Pacific Food- не хотите изменить политику работы с клиентами ????< /text>< pics>

<Time>1515993762391< /Time><rating>1</rating><Text>(Translated by Google) Disappointed by the price and assortment. If you compare with other stores like “Tashkent”, “Rasputin” in terms of assortment, price, then in the latter prices are lower, as for the assortment, you can find everything in Pacific in these stores, the difference is only in quantity, as well as the attitude of sellers to customers ( as in Raska) all gloomy and unfriendly, which immediately discourages the desire to buy something :). Conclusion: this is not a grocery store, it's just a name

(Original)
Разочарованы ценой и ассортиментом. Если сравнивать с другими магазинами как «Ташкент», «Распутин» по ассортименту, цене, то в последних цены ниже, что касается ассортимента вы можете наити в данных магазинах все что в Пасифике есть, разница только в количестве, также отношение продавцов к покупателям ( как в Рашке) все хмурые и недружелюбные, что сразу отбивает желание что либо купить:). Вывод: это не продуктовый магазин это просто название< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

сначала обрадовалась, соскучилась за русской(снг) едой...а потом узнала "своих".. купила конфеты Король великан, вафельные такие в шоколаде, большие.. а они просто тухлые, давным-давно просроченные, есть их просто нельзя..все выбросила(срока годности нет нигде).

<Review>(Translated by Google) Inside the store, beauty does not shine more like a warehouse. But despite this, at the entrance there is a barbecue on which barbecue is often fried in the daytime. Fragrance, incomparable. Large selection of Russian and Ukrainian products. A good selection of honey. There are medicines on sale, meat, sweets, cereals (buckwheat, semolina). There are brought products, analogues of which you can easily buy in an American store (soda, salt, pasta) and their prices will be lower, the same can be said about vegetables. Cashiers are not always friendly and welcoming.

(Original)
Внутри магазин красотой не блещет больше напоминает склад. Но не смотря на это, при входе есть мангал, на котором в дневное время часто жарят шашлык. Аромат, безподобный. Большой выбор русских и украинских продуктов. Хороший выбор меда. Есть лекарства в продаже, мясо, конфеты, крупы (гречка, манка). Есть привезенные продукты, аналоги которых можно без проблем купить в американском магазине (сода, соль, макароны) и цены на них будут ниже, то же самое можно сказать про овощи. Кассиры не всегда бывают доброжелательны и приветливы.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c295b6d57ba683:0x446e58a33a8a47f7< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>The pizza was delicious. But there was only one girl working behind the counter, and she wasn't friendly at all. Actually, she was unfriendly. She didn't seem to want to customize our pizza, hmmm! Isn't that what pieology is all abt? I've been to two other locations, and they were awesome. So it's not all pieology locations that didn't deliver.</review>< Date>

Not much more needs to be said for this pizza shop which has the BEST pizza in San Diego! Their pizza crusts are chewy (in the best way) and blistered and the toppings are DELICIOUS!< /review>

Cauliflower crust pizza that taste so delicious who made a bread eater like me to opt in for cauliflower crust - I ABSOLUTELY LOVE PIEOLOGY PIZZA . They have mastered the art of managing affordable price with quality food with consistency each time you order.</Review>

I usually love eating at the pieology back home in Phoenix AZ and was expecting the same type of quality. I was wrong! I ordered two pizzas for delivery and I feel like they didn't even look at my order when making them. There was no sauce on one and barely any on the other one. Both pizzas barely had any cheese and one of the pizzas was missing a topping (there were only 3 toppings per pizza). And the toppings that were on the pizza were scarce. The pizza was cold upon delivery and they forgot 80 cent ranch! After a long day, I would have liked a hot and tasty pizza.</review>

The premise is like Subway...stand in line...order what you want for you pizza. Not sure if I really like this concept for a pizza place. Anyhow...the employees were efficient and friendly. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with black olives. The olives were rather salty. I was able to get my pizza in less than 10 minutes. That part I really liked. Pizza was fine. Yes, I would return....but would not order the olives.</text>< Name>

I have eaten here at the Sportsarena Blvd. store and have never had any problems until today. I ordered from my phone Postmates, I apparently accidentally touched  ranch dressing on my wife’s pizza when the manager Gerardo opened the box I said what’s that? He said it’s ranch dressing I said no I didn’t ask for ranch dressing and he shrugged and said well? And pointed the order form at me and says: “see ranch dressing” it was as if he was saying “To bad Bro!” The two women working there were on the other hand were very, very nice! I don’t know why the guy wearing the blue shirt since he’s the manager has to be the least hospitable person.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Food is always really good. Service is consistently really good as well. Lines are sometimes long, which is guess could mean a good thing to prove the restaurant is popular. The quotes that used to be all over the big wall is gone, but they have added several beers on tap since I've been here last. They have a gluten free option for their dough which is nice for some. My kids got a free bambino pizza with purchase from their school which is neat that they even do.<//review>< pics>

Pizza made with as many or as few toppings as you want. Quick service. Friendly employees. Now call me crazy but the rust spots on the chairs look like prehistoric bugs.<//Review>

<Text>My family and I LOVE Pieology. We are frequent visitors of multiple locations.
Unfortunately our visit at this location was less the perfect. The atmosphere was very loud we were unable to hear the workers who were topping our pizzas and they seemed annoyed with the fact they had a difficult time hearing us. One gentleman dropped a topping on the counter part, picked it up and threw it on the pizza. When the pizzas were brought to our table the gentleman holding two of the pizzas coughed on one of the pizzas before handing it to us. I was completely shocked at what had taken place. Needless to say I was disappointed in our experience at this location. My family and I will stick to locations elsewhere.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I ordered online about a week ago and when i got there they said it would be a couple mins but i ended up waiting 20mins to only be told that they had messed up making my pizza and that they were making a new one. I was on my lunch, hence the online order, and had to leave without food. The manager told me she would cancel my order and the money still hasnt been refunded. So looks like they got my money and i didnt get any food from them.< /Text>

Its different.  So if you get use to it, it's good. Delicious. In store is a hang out spot , customer service was good but not great. Missed a topping on pizza was some confusion on how to add it.<//Text>

OMG! So dirty! They have cheese floating in the sauce. Not a Bad Thing unless you were vegan! Looks like no one has swept, cleaned or restocked in the last 6 hours. Pretty sad we've been here before but definitely our last visit</Review>

<review>My favorite. I will miss it but I will go each time I visit the area. Toppings are plentiful are fresh and the gluten free crust is the  best I have ever had. They are not stingy with the toppings.< /review><Rating>5</Rating>< user_name>

<review>Food is good. The knock is on the service and feels understaffed.  Some of the crew just have no other gear than slow. Lack of communication, conversation or comprehension is insane. The manager and a couple of them are always here and works their tail off. But select few bring the service down that bad.<//review>< pics>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>I enjoy the food at Pieology. Price is reasonable and food is always fresh. You are going to make your own pizza here by telling prepare staff just how you want your food. So, if you want ingredients added to your pizza you just tell them which ingredients you want as you go through the line. Only takes about 10 minutes to get your pizza ready it is fresh baked in the oven and it's delicious. Better than Round Table in my opinion. And Round Table probably cost double of what this pizza costs for a fresh made meal. Bravo, Pieology!!!< /review><UserId.>106093068823165490015< /UserId.>< date>

This was our first time eating at Pieology, we ordered one pizza to share and a gooey cheese bread, which was complimentary when you download the app. We had a slight issue with our pizza, the crust was a little on the well done side. So we brought it to the attention of the manager Craig and he fixed the issue immediately. Craig was amazing, even though he was extremely busy he took the time to chat with us and made us feel really important. He really took pride in his job, the best customer service I have experienced in a very long time. We will definitely be returning to this location. Thank you all so much for being so kind.<//Text>

I always love it here. The prices are reasonable and I can have whatever I want the way I want it. The only thing I would do differently is I would make things more visible for the children. They like to order their Pizza the way they wanted also but they cannot see what you have to offer because they are too short and the counter is too high. The only solution I could see at this point would be to build a step along the counter so they can climb up.< /Review>

I like Pieology because of the price and quick service.  Comparable to the Blaze Pizza brand. They also have the small sized pepperoni, which  make the pizza for me.  They also now serve alcohol.   They should add TV's but I am not sure they want customers hanging around, it is not like an Oggi's type of place.<//Text>

Went to eat before the San Diego Gulls game. It was very busy. The folks behind the counter weren't the fastest folks. It would be REALLY helpful if the sauces and toppings were listed on the menu so folks could have them picked out before they get to the counter. Pizza was great!<//text>

I have asked for vegan cheese for my pizza, and one of the employees asked me whether I have any allergies. And i said that I'm not allergic but I'm vegan. So he served some cheese. When I had the baked pizza I noticed that the cheese looked different from my previous orders with vegan cheese, which I had at the same location. I checked with the server and they confirmed it's nonvegan.

Very friendly staff. The pizza is created in front of you with your choices of toppings displayed. Served hot and delicious. My first visit and definitely not last. Downside, a little pricey but you definitely get what you pay for.< /Text>

The food is really good, the staff is helpful. The selection is easy. Only downside is the pizza was a bit greasy. However it's still a great place to go and get your money's worth with unlimited toppings.< /review>

Not usually a pizza guy...was kinda out-voted by family and boy was I pleasantly surprised.  The crust was perfect ...more on the thin side...so not too filling....the sauce and toppings were very good too. The staff was friendly and very patient with the newbies ordering kinda slow. The price was right and the experience makes me want to bring my pizza loving son after we get him after graduation. Well done people.<//text>

Have not found its equal anywhere. The Subway of pizza.  And I travel often. Besides a specialty pizza place or traditional pizza joint, this place is one to not pass up. Super fresh, fast and always good!!<//Text>

<Review>Best pizza place I've ever been to from the moment you walk in the door you feel welcome and energetic as you walk up to the counter to MAKE YOUR OWN PIZZA (employees do all the food handling) its awesome.  You can choose from 4-5 different crusts and then choose your sauce, toppings, and cheese (again lots of options each) or jist pick one of their menu pizzas then stand back and watch them go to work and once your pizza is cooking in the giant brick oven and you've payed for your purchase go sit down and relax because they bring your food to you.  This place is just fantastic< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<rate>2< /rate><review>First time here.  Place was not well kept by any means.  Big puddle in front of the cash register.  Trash can was piled high with a stack of at least 50 old pizza trays yet to be collected.  Toilet was broken in men's restroom, busted soap dispenser, and trash was piled high there as well.  Pizzas were undercooked, and topping buffet was really messy.  Lemonade machine was out of service.  Servers were friendly, but clearly not paying attention to upkeep. Maybe we came here on a bad day, but definitely not a good first impression.<//review>< Pictures>

Love this place! I eat 1/2 my pizza for lunch then the other 1/2 for dinner.. or lunch the next day. Ingredients are very good. It's fun to change up sauces and toppings to get a different experience every time.< /Text>

<review>This place could be so much better if they tried. It was not well kept and needed a good cleaning. The pizza was delicious but I believe their lack of cleanliness carried into the prep area as I got horribly sick with food poisoning after my last visit. I'd give them 4 stars if they had it together.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<text>This place was straight trash. I would not recommend it to ANYONE. They some how managed to lose my pie. Maybe this is because the manager could not manage her personal. If you are looking to eat amongst trash look no further. This place looked liked it hadn’t been clean in a while. Avoid place at all costs.

The crust was pressed out on this pancake like machine.  It was thin crush not bad.  Did not have to eat all those carbs with thicker pizza.
Decided to go wild and try all the items except a few. Loaded up the pizza with an red tomato sauce.  I think they said that the pizza was cooked in 3-5 minutes in there oven. I like it when they can get it fast.  It took longer to assemble the pizza.
They have a selection of beers and some wine and the usual soft drinks.  Nice open and clean seating.  The 11 or 12 inch pizza was plenty for two.< /Review></record>

This is a make your own pizza chain and I guess there are people who want to make their own pizzas?  I'm not one of them. There are literally dozens of excellent pizza places in San Diego, but If you just have an urge to pick all of your ingredients and sauce and stand in line like a subway sandwich shop, this is the place for you.<//Review>

But the pizza was undercooked - not all the cheese melted and the middle  was barely warm.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>OK so Pieology found the secret to making a good quick individual pizza.

So just like with my hamburgers I like to make sure a place can make a decent basic pie before I get creative... So I got a standard Hawaiian..

The crust was perfectly cooked, the toppings and cheese were very generous. I think mine could have used a little more sauce. I had to get a soda with my pie because they don't serve any alcohol so I couldn't enjoy a beer. So minus one star.

I ate half at dinner and a couple hours later the other half for dessert!

I'm excited to go back and try something a little more adventurous...</review>< pictures>

<Text>This was our first visit to Pieology and we really liked it. My son said that it was like Chipotle for pizza which is a pretty good description. They make personal pizzas that are thin and about 11" in diameter. You choose your crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings from a ton of different options. The pizzas were great. We will be going back for sure.<//Text>< pictures>

Really bad experience. Went for a Monday $6  pizza with a friend, they did not considered it & were rude about it. None of the people that made your pizza knew how to! Never going back!<//Review>

Pizza was really good.

Update 12/22/18: Terrible service today. Not even that busy, but service was slow as heck. Manager and employees look like they hate their job. Dropping one star.

Update 4/4/19: I absolutely hate how they don't have the ingredient names on the glass. Sometimes it's so loud, you can't hear the employee tell you what it is. Also, why the hell did they remove the pizza options menu? Look at subway, they have a ton of pre-made options on the board. All this does is make the lines longer. Right now, the line has 15 people in it. Ridiculous.</review>

we go there pretty often and when you go in person it is pretty fast and for the price it really is worth it. we are always satisfied by the "for here" pizzas. the dip dish take much longer though, you d be done with your pizza when the dip dish of your friend comes out (glad we waited on our friend to start)

I wouldnt recommend ordering on apps, it takes forever and if you dare ordering within their last hour of serving they mess up your order, one might actually wonder if it s not on purpose as everything you order is there just soaked with hot pepper as to make you pay for ordering late, you get burnt pizza....well, in short they are pretty careless if you are not in front of them.< /review>

<review>Its basically the 'Subway' of pizzas (as in the Subway sandwich place). Definitely innovative (as they're continuously playing with different ideas and themes) from their menu options to their dining atmosphere. The only thing that can be a bit irritating for me is the lack of consistency, mainly with regards to the toppings. I feel that I must point out here that I am vegetarian and probably the pickiest vegetarian ever known to man. I've been hailed as, "the worst vegetarian ever"... I don't deny this about myself, its actually the reason why I immediately fell in love with this place. In the beginning, they had all sorts of non-meat topping options, they introduced me (and more importantly got me addicted) to having corn and broccoli on my pizza. Then BAM! One day, no corn :( and then no broccoli! And then, the same thing the next time and then the next time and then I had finally pieced together that they weren't just, "out" they were discontinued, never to return again :,(
My pizzas looked so sad and plain. And they were. I returned, still hopeful, only to be let down time and again.
When you already have limited options by "choice" and then are also limited by chance (like when they're out of absolutely everything I actually want (and I mean even basil)) it's like, come on guys... (and I don't mean the staff here (they're great) I mean the company in general and/or the person ordering the stuff). Then, I'd forget about how it is (only remembering how it was) when I would happily/mistakenly suggest/agree to go with friends only to be reminded, once again. I eventually started opting for tomatoes (even though I dont like cooked tomatoes; because I can't justify going there for what is essentially a cheese pizza; especially when it costs the same as if I loaded up on every topping). Mainly, it adds some color psychologically "tricking" me to believe that "this isnt just a cheese and pineapple pizza." And while I'm not excited that night, they're not too bad when they're cold the next day :-/ it's something right?
They eventually wooed me back with alternate options I won't mention leaving you to potentially discover them on your own. I only say this because I feel like its really a whole nother corn, broccoli situation (introducing it just to have it disappear never to return). Only in this case I feel they didn't really mean for it to be a "topping" option but was the result of a creative stretch I took as a solution to my topping issue. I've grown to accept the corn deal but it's hit or miss with the staff surrounding said item(s) and I'm fearful it'll just not be an option at any given point. Until then, they're still good. But for most of society, I know none of that matters at all and in fact should probably sound great to you.
They have craft beer on DIY tap, they have(?/used to have) video games you can(?/could) play on their huge TVs with friends, they fixed their old chair problem (that God awful heavy metal dragging across the floor and then continuing to echo for all eternity sound anytime anyone moved them) fixed that, they now have many multiple crust and vegan options (fake meat, daiya, etc) if you're into all that which is a huge plus in my book (even though I don't utilize the options cause I suck) I feel like its progress in the right direction and fully support it and all that jazz. Also, there is free parking and they do have a great drink selection alcoholic and non.<//review>< Pics>

<review>Very disorganized.  Tried to give the wrong pizza when I finally got the correct pizza it wasn't cut.  The actual pizza was mediocre at best have had way better pizzas at other pieologies.  I would say skip this place and eat at one of the other numerous places nearby.</review>< Pictures>

Some what friendly service. More concerned with getting to the next customer rather then talking you through your first visit. I went with my daughter only because she was hungry and the Chick-fil-A across the street was closed. We had never been before and the pizza crust girl was rushing me and asking me questions I had no idea how to answer. I finally got through to the check out and they were pretty friendly. We got our drink and went to find a seat outside the place was clean over all and loud inside. They guy who brought our food was very nice and asked if there was anything else he could get me. I'm not to fond of pan pizza but I think that's all they serve, so I was too thrilled overall.</Text>

They have vegetarian options. You can get it with daiya cheese, and lots of vegetables; well a few vegetables. They don't pack the vegetables all I'm like I do when I make my own, but, they do a pretty good job.<//text>

Thia pieology is just the same as other pieologies. Nothing really special. You wait in line for about 10-15mins. Then order your hand made pizza and they'll bake it for you. The taste is always decent though< /text>

Long wait in line to order pizzas, sit and wait longer while in the oven. Seating not comfortable either. Not a fan of the concept.< /review>

Unfriendly customer service by what I'm guessing was the GM. Asked to try the cauliflower crust but was given the gluten free crust. Kept the pizza bc I didn't want to deal with him again.<//Review>

"Save time and skip the line. Order online!" - what a joke!!! Ordered 30+ minutes prior to showing up and they just put the pies in the owen. Had to wait 15 min. Place was empty. And got the order wrong. Not going back.< /Text>
