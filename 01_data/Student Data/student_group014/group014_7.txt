I love this place, and they always do a great job.  However I drove to get a haircut this evening and they had closed early even though their Google hours say they're open until 7:30.  Unfortunately I cannot get back the 45 minutes of time and energy/gas I spent to figure that out.

Great all around place, but please update hours if you've changed them< /review>

Always very kind. Always satisfied with my fades. Never had an issue with it being out of regs.

This is my go to barber, and it's cheaper than the PX if you pay in cash! Always bring cash on Sundays, sometimes they don't have card machine available.< /Text>

<review>I've been going to these ladies for years now.  They are friendly and eager to please with a good hair cut.

The weekend wait time tends to climb towards lunch and dips after 2pm.  However I rarely ever wait more than 10 minutes on peak weekend times.

Prices are great whether you're military or not. 9$ military 12$ regular for men.  Prices as of 2019.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Decent place for a haircut. I decided not to go for the pricey ones out there and spent $13 here. The military cut is $9. I am not sure about the other services they provide, but the place is clean and with plenty of staff. They aren't native speakers, but they understood what I wanted, and zero wait time. As a plus, they accept credit cards too.<//Text>

So here's a recent review for Lee's. I go for simple cuts, such as 1 inch all around. In that the regard the cut was pretty good and symmetric. Their strong point is the price. For males you pay roughly 9-10 dollars. Comparing it to some worse 20 dollar cuts I had, this was a good bang for the buck. Guys don't be intimidated by the women working there; they handle male cuts quite well.</Review>

Great hours, almost never a long wait. Open holidays. I have to remind them to get the hair behind the ear. They always forget. Have to do extra clean up back at home. Don't expect to hit the town right after a hair cut here. You definitely need a shower right after.</text>

THE SINGLE WORST HAIRCUT I HAVE EVER HAD! First off, I want to clarify that I rarely leave reviews and this is the first negative review I have ever written. I feel the need to leave this review to save others from having the same experience I have had. I sat down and was asked how I would like my hair to be cut. I happily told the lady I would like a #3 on the sides and a #7 on top, clarifying that I would like the longest hair on my head to be 3/4" long. She says okay and gets to it. We have a pleasant conversation about my recent move to the city and what part of town I live in. She starts off with the #7 comb on top, but she is going in the wrong direction with it, laying my hair down and just sliding over the top. She does this 6 or 7 times, then goes at it from a slight angle, still barely knicking the 2" or 2.5" hairs. She stops, having made hardly any difference and asks, "Shorter?" I say, "Yeah, down to three-quarters of an inch." She goes at it again in the wrong direction, acting as if she has never cut hair before. Then she switches out the comb on the clippers for a longer one, telling me that my hair "has a wave to it". This comb prevents her from cutting any hair at all, so she switches back to the first comb. Then she stop and asks again, "Is that good, or shorter still?" I tell her, "A little more. It's still pretty long." The hairs are still at least 2" long on the top of my head. She goes at it again, this time from the front and moving toward the back, making more progress, but still the hairs are longer than an inch and a half. She stops and asks again, "Shorter still?" I sort of laugh and tell her, "You can bring them down to three-quarters of an inch." I hold up my fingers to demonstrate that length. She says okay, then turns me away from the mirror for the rest of the haircut. At times during the haircut, I notice she is using the clippers with no comb at all, freestyle, holding them with both hands and making a jabbing motion at the side of my head to get the hairs. She holds up a mirror for me a few times, but points it over my head or at my chin instead of just turning me back around to see. After 40 minutes of sitting in her chair feeling like she was experimenting with all the tools available to her on her first day, she holds the mirror up for me again and asks if I like it. At first glance, in the little mirror it looks okay, so I say great. She thanks me and I go to pay. I am told at the time of check out that the credit/debit machine is broken and I can pay in cash only. The ATM in the parking lot charges me $3. I made this appointment a day in advance. A heads up on the credit problem would have been nice. I walk out and notice I am completely plastered in hair, not unusual after a haircut, but still unpleasant. Upon arriving home, I look in my bathroom mirror to discover that the left side of my hair is significantly longer than the right side. The right side is about right with .75" on top, .3 inches on the side.. But the left side is at least 1.5" on top, all the way from the midpoint on my head to the back edge of the top. I spend the next half hour in the bathroom with a pair of scissors, cutting my own hair. There were 5 or 6 inch-long hairs over each ear, hanging down, touching my ears. I eventually got the top to be more or less even. The top/back was nearly impossible to do myself, but my roommate says it looks good now. I just can't figure out what this lady was doing to my hair for 40 minutes. Maybe it was legitimately her first day, and if that is the case, then I take it all back, but that wasn't the feeling I got. She should find another gig because cutting hair is not it for her.</review>

A nice close place to MCAS Miramar to get your haircut. By all means if you want to sit at a barbershop for 45 minutes on base to get your haircut you can do that or you can come here and get in and out usually in 15 minutes. For $9, it's a decent haircut.<//Text>

In one word 'average'. The moment you walk in, you get an underground illegal surgery place kind of feel with all the employees wearing surgical masks and gloves. Do not expect them to figure out what kind of hair cut will look good for you.   You tell them I want a number 5 and they'll do a number 5, that's it.
Something that bugged me, you pay $1 extra for paying using a credit/debit card. So carry cash if you want to avoid that. I would probably not be going here again. I need a more professional service.< /review>

<Text>this place has no crew how to fade. i wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone, yes it’s $9 for military haircuts, but you get what you pay for. never coming back to Lee’s.< /Text>< pics>

<time>1434333605754< /time><Text>Last resort place. They don't know the difference between the types of fades. I asked for a medium low and due to the placement of the mirrors I could not see how high she initially went. I have had to have a fresh haircut every week for 10 years and this is by far the worst I have ever had. Then they laughed once I disclosed how unhappy I was.</Text></record></dataset><record>
<Response>None</Response><text>They had no idea how to cut my husband's hair. They were not very well understood in the way they talked and they messed up his head. Pointless arguing with them to fix it. Plus they cut the back of his head with the razor.

If you're looking for a quick, cheap, decent fade, this is the place; but, I do warn that they aren't the best and definitely make mistakes. One day they forgot to fade the left side of my head and I ended up with a line.</review>

I was very impressed with the amount of classics, collectors, and new comics/graphic novels this place had. As other comic stores that I’ve personally Been to only have classics and collectors. I’d say in my opinion this place specializes in the newest comics/graphic novels written in stock. Loved it!!< /review>< Time>

Pretty straightforward comic book shop. Decent selection of comics, probably better selection if older stuff than newer. Small sections of figurines and statues, but nothing overwhelming that's for sure. For its location in Monterey, this is a pretty neat little shop!<//review>

Comic selection was great. A lot to choose from. Customer service was below sub par to say the least. Counter guy had no people skills or even knew how to talk to people it seemed. Hopefully a good outstanding more verbal employee is working next time.</text>

<Text>Went in there recently after a while pretty much no yugioh card(They really just need to take down  the yugioh and the signs at the front) Very small amount of magic cards. Some cards sleeves. Wide variety of comic books. No tables to play card games with people. Overall disappointed.</Text>< user_id>

The owner is very nice and no one is a douche there((not all elitist)))! They have great deals here and there  I got two Walking Dead vol.s for the price of one! I typically purchase online but not lately they do have some pretty cool finds.
Only reason why not 5 star is because they don't have that many action figures, and lack on girl attire section. But over all I dig it!</Text>

Got to the shop 15 minutes before opening and decided to wait. They finally got there 15 minutes after the opening time, no apology or anything for making us wait. Was a bit disappointing when we did get in there and saw the small range with few collectables.</Text>

I initially had high expectations for this place. But was thoroughly disappointed by the service and quality of the food. The pork belly bun we ordered was way over cooked. We waited for 45 minutes for the rest of the dishes and then had an order mixup, then waited again. While the salmon in the salmon rice bowl we ordered was pretty flavorful and well done, the rice was coated in excessive amount of butter which made the dish overall very unappetizing.

So overall pros
Great food presentation
Well done meat

Cons
Long waiting time
Greasy food
Hectic service</review>

The pork shoulder an belly buns were below average mostly because the protein was very dry in both buns. Yucca fries were good and so was the breaded tofu. If they can elevate all dishes to the level of the rice bowl then you'll have a real winner here!</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<review>Great food at fabulous prices. The place is very small and crowded at lunch so if you can make it at another time, do so. There was only one waitress when we were there. Although she has the patience of a saint one can only go so fast. No reservations accepted.The food is fresh and wonderful with an innovative menu. Asian Fusion serving buns, noodle, rice bowls and Asian. I would definitely recommend<//review>< Pictures>

Had the Pork Shoulder bun. It was excellent. Also went for the pork broth noodle soup, spicy. Spicy it was. Excellent pork taste, noodles were OK. Tons of both pork belly and shoulder and the shoulder had a nice smoky skin on it. Overall good experience.<//Text>

<Review>I'm so happy this place opened up! The cassava fries were great - better texture and flavour than normal potato fries - and the dip they came with was addictive. The chicken in the chicken cutlet rice bowl was maybe even better than the pork cutlets I loved growing up, and the pumpkin and apple chutney that accompanied it made the rice bowl feel sophisticated without losing the sincere comfort food loveliness. All in all, very tasty and a welcome addition to the neighbourhood!<//Review><user>101888655971289581889< /user>< username>

< Review>
Small restaurant feels very cozy. We came by once they were open at 5:30, and the restaurant was already half full. That goes to show that the restaurant is pretty popular. I love the casual atmosphere here and the nose level isn't to overbearing. The pork belly bun is definitely my favorite among all the other buns with the smoked salmon a close second. The noodle bowls are delicious, but I feel they might be lacking in something. We ordered the Pork Noodle and didn't have to wait too long for the dish. The pork and the broth was very savory, I feel like it needed something sweet to go along with it (possibly sweet daikon or something along the lines of a hoisen sauce) to cut through the strong flavors. Aside from this, I'm giving 4 stars, not just for food, but also for the service. There is only one server on hand for the whole restaurant (probably seats 30 people total) most of the time. She's very nice, but when the restaurant is full, it's hard to get her attention when you need something since she's running around. They do have a second server now so it's a bit easier to get your needs met. Aside from that, I'm definitely coming back here.<//Review>

I tried to come here once before with friends but it was packed and the wait was long. They don't have many tables, and the ones they have are pretty close to each other. On the bright side, parking is easy!

With that said, I gave it another chance and I don't regret it. The buns were to die for and the ramen was simply delicious and big portions.

I didn't see in the menu some of the food items I was craving for from the photos here, which means they might rotate them... another incentive to go there more often!<//Review>

<Text>Pretty good!  The ramen, in my opinion, is more Chinese-Japanese style, but it is YUMMY.  The menu, presentation and taste is creative and lends an air of uniqueness to the experience.  Prices are a bit high for regular dining, for the size.  Definitely try the vegetable side dish in addition to whatever you're ordering.</Text><userid>110223448783380710704</userid><Rating>4<//Rating>< Pictures>

Food is good but their service is terrible. Not worth the hassle when they make you wait longer than necessary. The server sat a couple ahead of us at a four-person table instead of the two-person table next to it. Such an inconsiderate thing to do when we have small children. I asked her why she did that and she said the table was too small! We are never coming here again.< /review>

Soy sauce beef rice bowl was excellent. Very succulent meat, sticky rice and vegetables that were cooked really well, not too hard or overcooked. Staff was really friendly and the line at the door was deceptively long. Took only about 5 mins to get a seat despite there being 8 people in the queue ahead of us.< /Review>

For a casual place, this hits the spot. I'm a sucker for Asian buns and this Korean-fusion does deliver for local needs.

You would probably need to find something across the Pacific to beat quality of the dough. My only gripe is that the buns follow a strict flavour limitation which for me. The first bite is tasty but second and repeating bites are not building on the first. Yes food should do that but this is me nit picking.< /Text>

<Review>Neighborhood favorite, small rotating menu including hot, yummy bowls of ramen!  The neighborhood might be quiet, but this business is anything but!  Don't expect a relaxing meal during peak hours - it can get chaotic but the food's consistently top-notch for the price point.<//Review>< username>

Friends and kids tried all the buns, pork ramen, spicy fried rice stick, chicken cutlet, beef over rice for sat lunch, all pretty good, not impressed with salmon and egg plant bun. All agreed we will come back again. I think my colleagues would love this place for lunch. It works for most asian's taste bud .< /Review>

I'm so disappointed to report, we tried this place not just once, but twice, and we won't try it again. First, we tried the ramen. Super fresh, really pretty, nice portion.... but it was terribly bland in flavor. Even so, we gave it another shot and tried the pork and garlic noodles the next week. An even worse experience. Again it looked great and the portions big, but the pork was terribly fatty, I couldn't even tear it or chew it. The noodles were just okay, pretty bland, and the asparagus wasn't fully cooked. We really wanted to like it,and always try to support local businesses, but simply cannot recommend this place.< /text>

Called simply to ask 2 questions about the menu (what kind of ramen was served bc there was no menu online, and whether we could make additions). First time I called, phone was hung up halfway through second ring. Called again. Lady answering the phone tried to hang up on me twice, immediately after she answered each question. If I had a third question, it would not have made it out of my mouth. Incredibly rude over-the-phone service.

I'm sure the food is delicious, based on other reviews here, but that's not a license to be rude to callers. Disappointing.<//Review>

Tried the pork ramen, dandan noodles and a pork shoulder bun. All were good.

Lots of meat in the ramen. Dandan was different but very tasty. The bun had too much meat. They can use 1/2 or 1/3 of the filling to balance the meat-to-bun ratio.

The 🍺 on tap was good. Didn't have any though since wasn't in the mood for 🍺.

Service was excellent. One lady was taking care of the entire floor. Definitely would come back.< /text>

The crawfish bao is also very good. The pork belly wasn't quite as good: a little dry and heavy on the sauce. All of the bao are super-stuffed with filling so it's easy to order too much. Popular and has small dining room, so be prepared to wait.</review>< Pics>

Update 11/1/2017
Closed on a Wednesday? Strange.

The pork noodle soup is the best.<//Text>

Surprised by how tasty the vegetarian ramen was. I liked the creamy soup more than my friend did - it was a bit too rich for her. For me, it was a good balance - I've had richer tonkotsu or torisoba so... I agree with the reviewer who thought the ramen was more Chinese-Japanese style. This is definitely a fusion place.

The brussel sprouts in the warm eggplant salad were great. The eggplant wasn't bad but the oil got a bit heavy.

The poached salmon rice bowl was average.

Next time I'd like to try the beet salad and the other noodle options.

A slight side-eye to the waitress who wouldn't seat my 2 person group at a corner 2 person table saying it wasn't clean, and later let a couple sit at a 4 person table, and then let another couple sit at the same "dirty" corner table. Someone at the 4 person table right next to me kept burping. I guess one can't help burping.< /Review>

The pork buns were not as juicy as some other places, but the main dishes are pretty good. The place is small, so arrive before they open to get in line and guarantee a seat.</review>

<Review>Craving for Japanese Ramen or Pork Bun? Visit this place right now!

== Food ==
Pork Belly Bun (5/5)
Da bomb! Served on a fancy wooden serving board, the bun super mouth watering (presentation matters!).

True enough, it tasted so so good. The pork belly was juicy, slightly crunch and oh so yummy! The buns were superb, it was really soft and fluffy, I would like to think they made this from scratch!

Spicy Beef Ramen (5/5)
When it arrived, I thought I was in for some trouble. The redness of the soup made me think it's gonna be ultra spicy.

The first mouth I had, it was love at first mouth! The combination of the vegetable, the meat, the bouncy noodles, corn and spice that made this an amazing combo. Super super love it.

Soy Sauce Beef Rice Bowl (4/5)
Sizeable bowl, nicely spread out. Steamed vegetables on one side, beef chunk, beef slices, rice and the soy sauce on the beef.

It was a delightful and tasty meal. Even so, the two above beat this dish by miles. The next time I'm back, I'm going to try a different bun and a different noodles.

== SERVICE / AMBiENCE ==
Cozy restaurant, expect to be seated considerably close to other patrons. Might be tough for groups to get sitting and likely would have to wait for quite awhile.

Parties < 4 should be able to secure a seat decently fast. We were lucky and there were two seats available, patrons after us had to wait approx 10-15mins before they were seated. They have a name list where you would need to put your name down.

Servers were polite and prompt. Food was considerably ok speed given how busy the restaurant is.

I am in love with their food now, excited to be back for more!< /Review>< pics>

The menu was simple and the food was delicious. This place feels like a home-y yet quality restaurant.
I had the garlic noodles with the chasiu. The chasiu is not really chasiu -  more like a cross between chasiu and ribs. They were tender and not too fatty. Noodles were perfectly al dente and the flavour was really good, especially with the fried onion garnish stirred in. It did feel a bit oily and salty towards the bottom of the dish. Asparagus was amazing: nice balance between crisp and soft.<//Text>

<Review>This store has a large layout. Carrying trendy street gear. Professional sports teams gear. Work gear ( Dickies, medical scrubs). Kids school wear. Along with a large selection of caps. Backpacks and accessories with some fashion jewelry. Van Tennis shoes and purses are just some if the extras they carry. Things are sectioned out for ease of locating. Dressing rooms were closed. Hand sanitizer at door entry. Pricing is reasonable along with some markdowns and sale items. Parking in front of the store is limited.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>This place never fails on having t-shirts hats and pants that I want to get. Often comes in handy when I'm looking for a last minute outfit. Also have a wide variety of brands and styles. 👍 Definitely recommended.<//review>< pics>

<Review>Had a late night dinner at the Brass Rail a couple nights ago and I was so delighted with my meal I had to write a review. The bacon cheese burger was amazing, the meat is super high grade, the bun was soft and delicious, even the veggies were on point (proper Roma tomatoes not grainy watered down beefsteaks and fresh crispy lettuce and onion). The honey sriracha chicken wings had me in a state of food bliss. Undoubtedly the best burger and wings you can get within an hours drive in any direction. This place is a must try if you have not already made the stop. I am so thankful to have this option in our town.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Great for live music, decent bar food. I like all the theme parties they put on. I would give 5 stars but the bathrooms are well....less than acceptable as I had a gentleman standing right outside the stall I was in not 3 feet from me and looking over the low door. Needless to say it was very uncomfortable.</Review>

I read the other reviews before writing mine and apparently I’m not alone in finding the server attitude far below good service - it’s not possible to give below one star. I’ve been here numerous times in the past over the last seven or eight years and always had a good time, with prompt service. Tonight that was far from anything close to that. After ordering a round of drinks and food, we played pool. My next drink order was ignored. 3 times. My daughter got, I admit, Mama defensive and she and her friend left. I tried to talk reasonably with the bartender and literally everyone at the bar went posse on e, ignoring her rude ‘locals first’ behavior. I come from a very small island, I get that ‘We’re so cool’ schtick. They were juvenile and pathetic. And lost a nice tab and tip. One arrogant barely more than a child said the bartender was also the manager. Wow, really? Good luck with that! When the adults come back in the room, however long that takes, I might go back. Probably not. Oh, and when she learns how to make a proper Moscow Mule (like they used to do?)that might help too.</text>

Always a good after-concert bar when there is a show in  town. Weds & Sat. are karaoke nights for the brave or those that just don't care who's listening. Good fun, rowdy locals. Tho the owner & one of the bartenders can be rather harsh at times    ...< /text>

Here I went to a reception after attending a funeral,with the family. This church they tell me was brought to this site in two pieces and later put in place where it now sits. Lots of parking and ground it layed out to accommodate large groups of people.</text>

<text>Jesus died for all our sins.  Know Him personally? By faith and not by site.  He is good.  When asked who He was He said I am. Was He a liar? No.  Just God in flesh.  Only one who could save us.  Just got to check Him out.  I need Him.  Places like this guide you and neat to be amongst others who love Him to and want to know more.  All I can say.  Is a good thing for your week and your eternal soul.  Wanna see Him on good terms? Hahaha.  Just logical.  But it's more than just being good we can't always be.  Find out why.  I got this at 17. 40 years later still amazing!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Had an amazing experience at this store. For one, my wait time was less than 5 minutes. Secondly, the staff who helped me were super friendly and knowledgeable, especially Jennifer. I had kind of a big order (canceling lines, opening a new one, changing my address) so I was probably a pain but the staff didn’t seem to mind. Overall I’m very pleased with the top notch service. Thanks Jennifer and her team!<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

They shared their knowledge about the iPhone and Samsung products which in turn allowed me to make an easier decision. I felt heard when I explained my needs and Calvin acknowledged and helped with all the questions I had. His service was excellent and I would refer him to my family and friends.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

This store was immaculate and clean and all employees took precautionary measures during COVID. The employees were kind and helpful. No one was pushy and they answered all of my questions. I was able to ask about different scenarios with my family plan and they helped me find the best option for me. I like how you can see the different models and Other hey actually have a lot of accessories in stock unlike other stores.  This store isn’t the closest one to where I live but I drive here because it’s a better overall experience compared to any other store I’ve been to. They always go above and beyond and I’ll keep coming back here.</Text>

<Review>I have been a long time T-mobile client- 11 years to be exact. However, the lackluster service I was experiencing at my new home caused me to search for another provider. While I had intentions to visit Verizon, I decided to stop by AT&T Santee instead since it was the closest store near me at the time and was helped by a young man, CALVIN.

Calvin, thank you for providing such excellent customer service and for making our transition with the company as easy and comfortable as possible!< /Review><Date>1620872667910</Date><resp>{'time': 1621009390228, 'text': 'Wow, Papa John! We really appreciate your thorough feedback on your service with us. Thank you for coming in!'}</resp>< Name>

<Review>Great experience needed a new phone charger and was more than I expected. One of the service reps mentioned a buy 2 get one sale and that I could charge to my AT&T account to help defer coming up with all the money. Perfect suggestion!  Got what I needed plus a wireless charger which I am loving!</Review>< response>

<Text>Juan was so great!!! The best service I’ve had in a long time. He was patient, knowledgeable, and friendly. I was super indecisive and asked a million questions- he never made me feel rushed. Took his time and really helped me find the best solution for myself. He needs a promotion and a raise!!! Just impeccable service. I’ll stay with AT&T indefinitely if I’m treated that personablly every time. Ask for Juan. Juan congrats on your baby girl! Thanks so much for the iPhone 12 and the great help. You are a gentleman and a scholar.<//Text></record>

Cece, our rep had amazing customer service, she was very helpful, attentive, knowledgeable and personable. My husband and I upgraded our iPhones, I ordered them online for pickup. She provided boxes and return labels for us to mail our phones in. She thoroughly explained all of our questions with ease and was very pleasant to work with. 5+ overall experience with her!!</Review>

Nolen and Juan where very professional and quickly and efficiently helped my wife and I setup a first responder discount on our account as well as save us money by recommending we bundle our accounts to save a few more bucks. It's this type of service that keeps me coming back to this location even though I no longer live in Santee. Thanks guys</Text>

I came in because I was having trouble with my phone. Brooke helped me and she was great.
I bought a new phone.
When I returned home I was having the same problem.
I
Called and Sean talked to me on the phone. He told me not to worry and come on it.
Brooke was busy and lucky for
Me Sean was able to sort out my problem.
He did a more digging and found they were having trouble with a tower.
He could not give details but he was so kind and calm.
He helped me sort everything out!
I will now only see Sean!
Very pleased and
Happy!

Dealing with AT&T over more than 25 years I've had exceptional customer service in the stores and in my home. Cece at Santee was extremely knowledgeable, Pleasant, and accommodating in helping to set up our new phone. In our 7 years in San Diego we have used both the Santee and the Rancho San Diego stores and have always had exceptionally good experiences at both.</text>

Even though I had to wait over 45 mins to be seen I’ll still give them 5 stars.

They were upfront with me from the moment I came in, letting me know about the wait and everything. They stayed positive and professional the whole time.

Brooke aka the cat lover was great. Me and her were both laughing because I went into the store to buy a flip phone. Yes a flip phone (it’s 2020 LOL). Anyways I also found out we listen to the same YouTube tech review guy Flossy Carter. But overall Brooke was great I loved having her help me. Great customer service 👍🏾</Text>

Went to AT&T yesterday and had the best service and I even got my friend to switch to AT&T while I was there upgrading my phone to the Z Flip.  The manager and representative there were so nice and took their time setting up my new phone and hooking up my friend with her new phone. The one thing that was really nice was that there was no pressure on having to buy more of anything and even when my friend was asking questions about switching there was no push on having her switch.  Would highly recommend this location for all of your AT&T needs. Thank you AT&T Santee staff. :)</Text>

Super impressed. Autumn is outstanding. She was friendly, professional and extremely helpful. I came in for an upgrade and walked out with a better service plan and a great new phone. She was so conscientious that she double and triple checked to make sure that changing plans was actually in my best interest. It turns out it was and the savings helped pay for my new phone. Couldn't be happier with my experience and outcome. 5*!<//Text>

I went here to Add my son to my Plan and had the Same experience. The staff was warm and let me stay in the store with my kids. I had taken all the Covid Precautions and they recognized that. The rule was 1 person at a time. It’s great to see that they are Human and realize sometimes accept ions need to be made. Great service and all my questions were answer. Easy process, No 100 Papers to sign. This is why I keep coming back. Thank you Justin! You are an excellent Leader for that Store.< /review>

Are you ready for this? Our intention was to change internet company  maybe purchase TV service and maybe home phone service as well, we were also wanted to change cell phone company. Why we wanted to make this change? We have been having lots of issues with the cable company that provides us with the internet service, we also had a very bad customer service experience at our cell phone company. We have been with these companies for several years, my credit score is in the 840's and my Son's in the 780's.
The lazy guy that "helped us" at this particular ATT Santee location literally told us that we were fine at the companies we were trying to fire, he wouldn't even try to either compare or offer us a better option. As a matter of fact, our perception also was that this guy didn't want to deal with us like if we were doing something wrong.
I have a question, is that the way you train your employees?
I also challenge the person in charge to find out that what I am saying here is a1000% accurate.
Shame on  ATT.<//text>< user_id>

I had the most confusing issue with my new tablet I ordered it over the phone but it wasn’t the one I wanted so I called the store to see if I could get the right one. Andy, the store manager, and Sean took care of me right away! This is the best store! I definitely won’t go anywhere else!< /Review>

<review>I have been using this store for years. My visits are always quick and I get exactly what I need. I never spend more than 200 on a phone so maybe that's why it's so easy to handle things, but if you're just going to get a new phone to replace your broken one, this store has done great for me. Quick and easy. Knowledgeable and friendly workers.<//review>< pics>

<Text>Cecilia is the absolute best technical support person I have ever worked with. Navy Veteran..20 years..in the IT field..so when I say ahe is the best I mean it. She is very knowledgeable..extemely patient and though..
She is second to none and AT&T would do well to keep her on staff..do not let her go to another company....</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Due to an error of my own while ordering a new product online, I was instructed to go into a physical AT&T location and prove my identity. For whatever reason, the system flag my activity as being suspicious, no big deal. I went to this location and anticipated the usual wait. Eli was the employee that helped me and my review is based on him and his customer service. I get it, you're in retail, it's the holidays. However, seeing other comments/reviews on his performance, perhaps this is just the level of service he brings. Simple takeaway, if your profession is in sales, you're going to have to deal with all types of people, sometimes for the better or worse. One poor experience isn't going to make me question AT&T, this is more of a public service announcement. If Eli is there, perhaps ask for someone else.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
This place made my life so much easier! I had to buy a phone, change numbers, get another phone repaired and add a line. I was in and out of there in 1- 1/2 hours (not bad since we had to do a diagnostics and back up a phone) with EVERYTHING taken care of! Shout out to Shawn for being so knowledgeable, professional and efficient - so refreshing to receive such great customer service! Thank you AT&T! You need to keep that guy - he makes you look really good! One stop shop!< /Review>

Nolan at the Santee, Ca location was beyond our expectations. His customer service was impeccable and he is a top notch worker, we would recommend AT&T to anyone because the service is great, but would send everyone to the Santee location because of Nolan.</Text>

I must commend and thank MARK for his great customer service, pleasantry, and thorough knowledge explained in a way of helping this grandma understand phone plans, technology , how SIM Cards work,  (I’m easily outranked by kindergarteners!). Mark, our grandson in NY will enjoy his new number! Thank you!<//Review>

Although the store was clean, nice and seemingly well managed--most services offered there could be handled online or over the phone... and some couldn't be handled in the store at all, plus - a wait time to be seen.

Try just calling AT&T and see what you can get done before wasting a trip here.< /Text>

<review>I went into this store after getting nowhere with the nation-wide customer service numbers. I walked in ready to cancel my account. Instead, I ended up talking with Steve F. and he was able to resolve my issue. He definitely saved AT&T a customer. He spent about an hour with me and talking with his customer service contacts. I renewed my contract with AT&T Uverse instead of canceling it thanks to Steve F..

Word of advice: avoid dealing with the nation-wide numbers. People are much more helpful face-to-face.< /review>< GmapID>

I bought a tablet 2 days ago that did not function properly. I went to do  buyers remorse, they charged a restocking fee of $50 that I was originally told was $35. Customer care was no help at all. All they want to do is give me a bill credit. NEVER GO TO THIS AUTHORIZED RETAILER.  It's best to go to a Company store.</Text>

<Text>The customer service rep here was not helpful and had a bad attitude towards AT&T Customer Care.  If you bash your company, you make you and them look bad. Poor attitude lost my business.  I recommend any other location, which is unfortunate because I love so close and I prefer to shop locally in Santee, but I refuse to support a store who's employees don't support their corporate sponsors.</Text><user>102564613559065259294</user>< GmapID>

<Text>These people are a bunch of crooks who will lie to you just to make a sale. It’s a fair assumption that they do this for two reasons...they probably work on commission and clearly they don’t have a conscience. I would recommend NOT switching to AT&T but if you do, go to a different store to do so.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>The people in store were very nice. My brother passed away suddenly and I needed to cancel his service. When I called the 800 number the people were rude and insensitive. They couldn't seem to comprehend that my brother was deceased and had zero compassion. They continued to ask what they could do to keep me as a customer. I had to go to the Santee store and they helped me without a problem.<//Text>< Pictures>

Since we have signed up for the bundle package in February 2017, billing and having situations corrected has become a nightmare. We have been a loyal customer since 2006, and we do not feel that the company cares about its customers. Very disappointed!!!!!<//text>

< review>
This place really pisses me off. Broke my phone and went in to get another one was told my insurance that I have been paying extra monthly on didn't cover it and was forced to make monthly payments on a new phone. It was Christmas time and I needed a phone since I have no house phone so I had to get a new one and make payments.  Was told that I could pay more torwards the phone cost as I go or pay it all off to lower or finish the monthly payments.

Found out later by calling AT&T that the insurance did cover the phone that was broke but it was too late to use it now.

Went back to the store to explain what the clerk had told me about the insurance and they asked who had helped me. I told them who helped me and they laughed saying Ha yeah she doesn't work here any more. Asked to make a payment towards the cost of the phone I was still paying on and they said can't make payments towards it only can pay it off completely which was  $279 left. SMH. Was told before I could make more payments towards the phone it self.

Asked about Wi-Fi for my home and they said I qualified for a discount with my combined services and my teacher discount. Their computer showed the cost of WiFi at home as 29 a month. After checking they said yeah it says 29 but we can't get the computer to take that price so it's going to be $37 a month but we will credit you $100 to help off set the price. Never got the $100 off.< /review>

This store doesn't deserve even one star!! I ordered 4 phones online, ported 4 Sprint numbers over with AT&T chat rep online who said Buy One Get One free offer was good if I purchased 3 Samsung Galaxy S8 Actives and 1 Samsung Galaxy Note 8. I completed the order and set an appointment for pickup at this store in Santee. Brooke who helped us at this store was confused at first when we got there because only two of our numbers ported over correctly. Shane, the store manager, proceeded to help her and they finally figured it out. However, Shane tried to tell me that the BOGO offer did not apply to buying 3 S8 Actives and 1 Note 8 and that it only applied to "like for like". He proceeded to tell me I would need to purchase another Note 8. I told him that is NOT what the chat rep said and I believed he was mistaken. Fortunately Brooke explained to him that the offer was for any Samsung and did not specify "like for like". Shane then said he would "look it up". He was trying to make a sale and got shot down. He found where it said it was for any phone in the Samsung family. If you plan to switch services or buy any phones using BOGO offer, beware of going to the Santee store!! I hope this review prevents other customers from being conned into purchasing a more expensive phone.<//Text>

Went in with a really problem. Trying to deal with my service. ...yet a employee name Nicky totally saved the day.  Thank you so very much Nicky your a 😇. Ok here I am ....still almost a year later. Almost Every month is a nightmare. Often taking in proof of payment (2 wks in advance pymts)still not getting proper credit with late fees or credit at all , for pymts or being charged with extra packages, the list goes on and on. Hope I move out of state before my contract is up soooooooo not worth the grief!  Better channels by far yet actually costing more than Cox cable with AT&T having more buffing and freeze.</Review>

Most of the staff is clueless, getting service is very slow, although to be fair,  Verizon is just as bad. AT&T prices seem a bit better than verizon,  but online service is horrible.</Review>

Wasted a trip & my time by coming here!  Worst customer service! Just kept telling me to call  ProTech Support. Let him know that his lack of care or help wasn't appreciated. He just said that's what they are paid for at ProTech Support.</Review>

It's been a decade since I went into an AT&t store because the last time I did the customer service was atrocious. Now I'm looking at adding an additional line and I'm either looking at Verizon or AT&t. Somehow they're customer service actually got worst. Verizon here I come.< /Text>

We are from Texas and had an emergency and needed a new sim about 20 minutes before opening . Whoever the man was inside looked at us, rolled his eyes, and shook his hand no. It was SO RUDE! Absolutely unacceptable customer service.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) A single persana in Spanish, does not attend well makes people wait talk a lot about their personal life looking for customers for another business and not attend to the one who expects and eventually leaves early and does not attend to those who wait for more than half an hour.

(Original)
Una sola persana en español, no atiende bien hace esperar a la gente habla mucho de su vida personal buscando clientes para otro negocio y no atender al que espera y al final se va temprano y no atiende a quien la espero por mas de media Hora.< /text>

Great service. Fantastic organic coffee. They even make the decaf exceptional! Fresh pastry. Relaxed environment. Good prices on all items from lunch sandwiches (on their freshly baked bread) to while loaf or sliced to order bread varieties. Nice place to get some computer work done. Beats Starbucks down the road.<//review>

Far, far beyond what the strip mall joint it first appears to be at a distance. This is a classy little upscale and at the same time homey cafe where I had some of the best restaurant food anywhere. Quite surprised and delighted. And the service was genteel and graceful. Am actually astonished.<//review>

Their coffee is so good and not expensive! I wish I lived nearby so I could get iced coffee from them all the time. Really, don't even think about going to Starbucks when this gem is right there.
Delicious pastries! I could happily eat an enormous bowl of their pastry cream with a spoon.< /Review>

Love this place! Love the baked goods. I'm on a mission to try one of each. I am beyond excited to have an Iranian pastry shop so close to home. They took care in designing the place. Relaxed, enjoyable and yummy experience!</Review>

Extraordinary. So happy to have found a quality coffee shop and the pastries are divine! We tried one of their many protein shake offerings and were not disappointed. Healthy ingredients, wonderfully made. Looking forward to trying their homemade rye bread and more of their delectable deserts. Outstanding!< /Text>

Wonderful challah and French toast. Not quite ready for "prime time". Long time from placing order to order delivery to table. Worse, toilet was broken. Hope they get things straightened out by the time of their grand opening end of this week.<//Review>

Unique flavors that aren't too strong, but still flavorful in its own right. Find different types of cones and toppings to choose from. More of a modern atmosphere and the only downside you might consider is the wait line, parking, and pricing.

<Name>Angie C. Diaz</Name><Review>The flavors are different, as diverse as Pineapple Dole ice cream, rose tea ice cream. My favorite is the sea salt caramel one. The puffy cone is also good, as its one of its signature items. If you are into desserts, you'll like it. Customer service was great, friendly staff members. Price was $6.75.< /Review>< Rating>

< Review>
Ordered the red velvet puddle cone w/ earl grey lavender ice cream. For $6.75, I was able to share it with another person and both of us were filled up. The ice cream complemented the puffed cone well. The wait was about 10 minutes and the parking lot is quite small. If you don’t want to wait in a line, go on the weekdays!</Review>

<text>Taste so good. Their ice cream is the nitrogen gas cooled made to order ice cream. Which means it will taste so smooth yet fresh. And plus fluffy waffles added to it. You can choose vanilla, red velvet or churro flavored waffles. Only problem I had was that I wanted to use Samsung Pay or Apple Pay. And I know for sure their system is compatible and the cashier who was so ignorant told me do firmly 'we don't accept those and plastic card only'. Wow! I don't carry plastic card normally. Please somebody educate this girl who is from 1990s lol. I've been using the samsung pay since 2016. And any credit card machine that has swiping feature works with samsung pay. I had to run to my car to get my wallet. It could've been 5 stars without the country girl.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<Name>Meme Nisimo< /Name><review>I'm an ice cream aficionado. This is not 31 Flavors or Thrifty. Those have their place. This ice cream is deliciously smooth due to the nitrogen process. Each order is made just for you. The flavors are very unique. If you are looking for traditional flavors go elsewhere. I find their fusion flavors delicious but there are some who won't.< /review>< Rate>

<review>Honestly it's a place for SWEET TOOTH people. The ice cream is really sweet, and if you get it with the puffle cone,which is also pretty sweet
Et. It gets 2X sweeter. I couldn't finish it alone.< /review>< Date>

<Review>Always wanted to try this out & I definitely recommend going here & buying the the Vanilla Puffle Cone. They have all sorts of ice cream flavors there. Ate it so fast that it means its that good 😄😆 Try it out! Don't miss out 😊 It's also a good place to hang out or have a date there since the store "7 leaves" is right next door. Very convenient 😋</Review>< gmapID>

Best of cream ever! Great flavors and great ingredients. Ask for a flower shape to your ice cream if you'd like one. Also don't forget to tip! They work hard there.< /text>

Aside from the huge line at 7 leaves for whatever reason the experience at Cauldron was a very pleasant one. I love the concept and the food was amazing. Seems like something that should be at Disneyland. It's very nice!< /Review>

I have been a few times. The ice cream flavors are rotated monthly to satisfy all palates but do have the top flavors pretty consistently.  I like that the flavors are bold, true to the flavor. Flavor selection ranges from simple to more elaborate with their suggested flavors of milk and cereal, pineapple express, or s'mores.<//text>

This place is my favorite ice cream store. Sure, it pricey. Sure, it takes a bit longer to get your ice cream. Regardless, this place is so worth it. Nothing else needs to be said.

<Review>To say that the ice cream here is unique would be underselling just how fresh of an idea it is. All the staff was very friendly and helpful when trying to decide which of their flavors or styles of ice cream I could try and the despite being busy the wait time was very short. All in all a great place to get ice cream.</Review></record></dataset><record>

The ice cream choice is a little small but good nonetheless. I tried the vietnamese coffee which was good, but tasted like regular coffee ice cream. It didn't have that distinct condensed milk sweetness i was expecting. My boyfriend got The Cauldron which was really good! The puffle cones are freshly made and warm when you order them which is perfect because they absorb the ice cream as it melts and makes for a sweet treat at the end of your cone.</text>

Ice cream is good. Reasonably priced when compared to places such as Creamistry, but lacks in number of flavors.<//Text>

Excellent and friendly staff and good ice cream. It's right next to 7 Leaves, so you can get a drink too (but you should get ice cream instead).</text>

(Translated by Google) To my liking ... the best snow I've had, it only took one star because it has so few flavors. But the texture of the snow seems to me to have the perfect consistency🤤

They have a great slection of things to eat from soups and sandwiches to main courses. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. She suggested the soup for me and my mom has a salad. The food was fresh and tasty. They have a nice outside eating area with tables and umbrellas. It was a sunny afternoon so we ate outside. I enjoyed the afternoon meal with my Mom.

Waited in line for 10 mins then got to register and "manager" told me I was in wrong line even though she took the guys order in front of me and said sorry no service for you! Can't believe the service here is that bad. Everyone is spread out due to social distancing so there was no line just 5 people standing as far away as possible from each other.</Text>

Open long hours. Does have extensive omelet and scramble menus. The kitchen is flexible enough to cook a scramble with your favorite ingredients. Freshly squeezed orange juice is excellent. Espresso is not so good. However the last visit was a little different experience. It took a wail to convince young male manager(?) that kitchen knows how to do my order rather than do it his way. But after all everything worked out. Conditional Four stars or more.< /text>

Rude, demeaning staff! The manager Benjamin was just as bad or worse! The food is also over-priced and terrible! I got sick after eating here! Don’t subject yourself! You’ll be terribly disappointed. Check there Yelp reviews! These seem like they’re fake here because this place is horrible! The owners response to a previous reviewer when they complained the food was bad, “it’s not the food it’s you!” What manager says that? He should be fired! Without customers, a place goes of business! This place looks like it’s on its way out!</Text>

We are here a lot but the prices are pretty high. The kids Jr burger for the price is just embarrassing as if your child is over 3 he will be hungry. It's not even one slider. Food is consistent otherwise</Text>

Hands down best lowkey place for breakfast, pretty disappointed when they closed down the Crystal Cove location but their breakfast sandwich makes up for any inconvenience. Also have great hand squeezed orange juice every morning<//review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Nice place to have a walk, enjoy the birds or simply have a picnic on the grass. In some areas it looks a bit dirty, and it feels a bit small too, but the views of the river and the oldtown across the street was worth it. There are also some interesting informative panels about the history and the animals in the area. I do recommend, however, to go the other side. To me, much better than this other side! The have restrooms and bike and board renting if you want.<//Text>< pictures>

Pretty dirty down in the rocks but great place for fishing.  Got a few nibbles but nothing more than that. The sun beats down on you at the rivers edge tho - very little shade<//review>

Great place to come for a nice walk, place to relax, sit at the water, even have a small picnic with someone you care about or just want to spend some quality time with. Have great conversation even a family outing. It has great views in the day, and even better at night! The only downside, their are a lot of homeless people. Most of them stay to themselves, but you always want to be cautious and aware of your surroundings. Especially at night. Also there are a lot of geese and sucks, so be aware and look down. They poop a lot!<//review>

Always a lil dirty from lazy people not throwing away their trash, scooters & shopping are constantly getting knocked into the river off the bridge... Lots of birds, & other wild life if you wait or get lucky too

Nice for parking though, keep coming back for that</Text>

<text>The River Walk was the host spot for the Northern California Crossfit Classic 2019.  This was a 3 day event that offered athletes of all ages to compete for their share of $50k in prize money.  These competitions were  as intense as the heat, so congratulations to the athletes and teams for giving their all.  See you next year!< /text></record>

Good for walk and seeing the river. But it is not  clean, probably because of leaves all over the place. A lot of homeless people around.</Review>

During covid all we have is trails for exercise. This trail is very peaceful and quiet, i love it amd my wife loves it as well.   Walking is great exercise for the heart as we tend to get older, stay safe and healthy friend's.</Review>

Nice little picnic place. Very little free parking so will most likely have to park in garage. Great little walk to the Tower Bridge and into Old Sac. My small kiddos always enjoy it. Only downside is the trash cans are always overflowing.< /text>

It was not as safe in terms of no railings around riverwalks and all, but I like it even with my 1 year old. It was great, not cleaned but it was just Bird poop.< /Text>

Nice park along the Sacramento River, but more for leisurely walking and bike riding. Beautiful views of Old Sacramento and downtown Sacramento. The bathrooms loom scary since a lot of homesless people use them, and a lot of transients tend to hang out along this park. Definitely worth checking oir the annual West Sacramento Cyclocross Grand Prix in Oct. Every year. Fun event at this park.</review>

Old Sacramento & city views are fabulous. A stroll on West Sac river walk is a treat after a long day. Nice clean sidewalks lined with roses can make a romantic date complete. Canadian geese are a bit grouchy but they are all hiss and no bite. For sure a favorite place to stroll in the lovely city in which we live.< /Review>

Walked both levee top & below levee along the Sacramento River, from Broderick Boat Ramp to the I-80 Pioneer  Bridge.  Note pictures showing levee trail at grade with railroad, so go down off the levee and then continue underneath  the I-Street Bridge.  Very nice!
And ate at the Waterfront Cafe inside the CalSTRS headquarters building!  The food was well prepared and tasty!<//text>

Nice but needs to be better maintained and cleaned up.  I also think they need to trim the trees a little to give a better view of the river.< /Review>

This is a paved trail. From here you get amazing views of the Tower Bridge as well restaurants on the other side of the river. There is also a public restroom.  The place gets a little eerie after dark with homeless people on bikes. The place had like 10 other people once it got dark. Along the walk, there are several information boards that give a lot of interesting information.</Text>

Love this river walk park. Great place to clear your head. Nice view of the capitol bridge at night and right across from old Sacramento... Defiantly a must visit spot...</text>

<Time>1507132291484<//Time><Text>The park is a thin strip of green along the waterfront in West Sacramento. There are trees to sit under and grass to relax on while reading a book. I was there for a cyclocross race, so there were food trucks and vendors, which made it more fun.

Nice riverfront area running along the Sacramento River, near the I Street Bridge and across the river from Historic Sacramento. They have a little weekend shindig called "Off the Grid" with food trucks, libations, and music.</text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><rating>4</rating><review>Riverwalk Park in West Sacramento is an easy trek across the Tower bridge from Old Sac. West Sac is an up-and-coming area and there will be more and more to do. Burgers and Brew is just a few blocks away in the historical Old Firehouse. The buildings here are State offices, dgs and calstrs. The Ziggurat is a cool building from the outside. Views of the Tower Bridge, the river and Old Sacramento are worth a visit. It's a hotspot for Pokemon too.  Parking is especially easy and free on the weekends.<//review><GmapID>0x809ad6cb89fd3b17:0x973b41d7f26299be< /GmapID>< resp>

Debris litters the shoreline. Dead trees, metal guard rails. Lots of mud along the path, no place to sit on a lawn. View isn't special.

Graffiti. Enough said.<//text>

(Translated by Google) It is a super quiet park !! It is not so crowded, but it is ideal to relax and spend a very pleasant time observing nature. There are too many ducks and squirrels. Well, walk in the midst of them and they are harmless. There is a public bathroom and benches where you can sit.

(Original)
Es un parque súper tranquilo !! No es tan concurrido, pero es ideal para relajarte y pasar un momento muy agradable observando la naturaleza. Hay demasiados patos y ardillas. Pues caminar en medio de ellos y son inofensivos. Hay un baño público y bancas en donde poder sentarte.<//review>
