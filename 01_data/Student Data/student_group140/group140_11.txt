<text>The apartment overall is very spacious and the layout is ideal in comparison to nearby apartments communities, unfortunately it seems as if the Metropolis community is not fully dedicated to addressing issues that residents bring to their attention.

I've recently been experiencing a noisy neighbor above me. I've tried to bring this to management's attention and instead of communicating my concerns to the resident, they informed me they need to verify the noise. It is very inconvenient and frustrating to have to pinpoint when noise occurs, call the office and have them come into my apartment, during covid to listen for noise. I have meetings throughout the day and I am on Zoom calls. Also, alot of noise occurs outside of the normal office hours and because of this, I am unable to have them verify it. I don't believe courtesy call to neighbors is too much to ask. Essentially the community is saying I am incompetent and unable to distinguish noise above vs on the side of me (I have a corner unit with only one side neighbors). I've been advised to inform the courtesy patrol,  but nothing had come of this. I still hear excessive noise and banging throughout the evening and early in the morning (most recently this morning at 6:15am).

Perhaps the most irritating experience is that the neighbor above me allows their dog to urinate on their patio and unfortunately the urine drips down to my patio. I've placed maintenance work orders and called the office about this multiple times. It took almost a month for somebody to get back to me and I had to inform them of a formal complaint that was going to be filed. This is unsanitary and disgusting. After weeks of waiting I was able to have it cleaned up and management contacted me about this. I was informed due to privacy issues they could not confirm they addressed my concern to the resident above. Tonight I went back in my patio and I see urine again. At this point I have to believe Metropolis has failed to communicate my concern and is unwilling to resolve my issue.

I am overall impressed with the apartment layout and size, but I am very disappointed at how Metropolis has handled concerns. I don't typically leave reviews, but considering this issue has been expressed since January and I am still experiencing urine in my patio, I feel I've given ample time.<//text>< pictures>

<review>-nice big balconies which are hard to find
-if you live facing White, you will have a great view but deal with the noise from the business at all hours of the night. Thought Irvine had rules about this, but the plastics company across the street works 24/7 and always has semis idling at all hours of the night that WILL keep you up. When I emailed the front office they told me there was nothing they could do.
-units are nice, but the longer we live here-the more you see how fast it was built. many windows/counter top is pulling away from the wall and practically cracking.
-awesome amenities
-some neighbors are more than inconsiderate. My neighbor that parks next to me parks 3 inches away from my car everyday and it's impossible to use my passenger door. Also, drive very slow because everyone in their sports cars whip around the parking structure. Almost been hit multiple times
-cleaning staff is extremely nice and hard working-A+
-I've had a few emails go completely ignored...
-one of my biggest issues that has changed...we are no longer permitted to park on Sullivan. Until 6pm everyday, only workers of the businesses in the strip mall in front of us are allowed to part there-what?!?!? This is OUR complex and that should be for OUR guests.  Our guests and family members usually have to end up parking in an abandoned parking lot across the street that isn't paved and my sister got a flat tire from.
All in all still love living here, but some things have disappointed me</review><userid>112775566502980322533<//userid>< gmapID>

< review>
This is by far and away the least sound proof apartment I have ever lived in. The front doors to every apartment are hollow metal and you routinely hear dogs barking, doors slamming, and car alarms in the parking garage going off. There is almost no sound proofing between floors so I hear my upstairs neighbor's music and footsteps every day. They call them luxury apartments but they were clearly built cheaply. After a little over a year into our lease shelves are sagging, hinges are coming loose, and the windows provide no sound dampening. I've started sleeping with ear plugs in. Its proximity to UCI means there's a lot of students here which equates to loud music late at night and people revving car engines going up and down the street nearby. On top of that the fire alarm is triggered fairly regularly with no update from management if there was a fire or false alarm. After a year long string of thefts in the garages they finally installed security cameras but it remains to be seen if this fixes the problem. I've always found the staff to be friendly but never helpful. High turnover rate leads to very inconsistent information. All in all the apartments are not worth the cost of rent.< /review>

These "luxury apartments" have the worst entrance to the parking lot.  We fought with ants for two weeks!  Rules are more important than residents.  If you want a truly "luxury apartment" skip this place.</Review>

<text>Nice building which is fashionable and easy to get sick.  Friendly staff, but not always helpful.  Convenient layout of the apartment, but the door to the balcony does not close very well.  Pretty good gym.  There is billiards, jacuzzi, bowling, bbq zones, but because of covid-19 everything was closed, there are no claims, this is the case everywhere.  There are places where you can sit with a beautiful view of the fire, the pool and the "M" logo, but not everywhere the fire always worked, sometimes the seat cushions were dirty, and the letter "M" only glows halfway (broken and not repaired. That is, a lot  pluses, but almost everything with minuses.From a completely negative - parking !!! Places in the main parking lot are tied to the apartment is just terribly unfair, my apartment is one of the farthest from the parking lot, but also my parking spot is one of the farthest possible in the parking lot  , a very quick step from the parking to the apartment for more than two minutes !!! There is only one place for 1 bedroom. and the design of the parking itself is just awful, you can't go around the corners, but you need to drive a high level!  almost always full, I am glad that everything has never been busy Delivery of groceries and food - you always have to explain everything and drive the delivery men, otherwise you cannot get up without a key, out of 5 orders only 1 reached the apartment.  So be prepared for this.  I noticed this during 3.5 months of living, what's next ...</text><username>Nikk Williams< /username></record>

<Text>Very weak Management team. Not enforcing Covid-19 guidelines at the gym. Residents are allowed to exercise without wearing masks. I brought it up to the office team today as I was at the gym and again one person was not wearing a mask, and the response was "oh.. we will try..". There should be no alternatives. No Mask = No Workout. The entrance door of the gym should have a sign (like at stores and restaurants). But no signage in sight. The gym attendant is trying and asking residents to wear masks but without the support of the management he can only enforce it so far. Terrible.</Text>< pictures>

Couldn’t have asked for a better experience — and thankful for all of the efforts she provided.

The staff is incredibly rude, and the fire alarm is always going off, sometimes for days. Luxury apartments? Falsely advertised. Do not recommend, I would give this place 0 stars if I could. People leave a lot of trash in the hall ways, and it stinks. I cant wait until my lease is up.< /Review>

Simply spectacular!! I can honestly say moving from Essex Skyline to Metropolis was the best living decision I’ve made. Normally once you’re in a complex, you feel like nothing but a number. But everyone here, especially my leasing agent Amad have been nothing short of amazing. He and Joseph, the property manager, go out of their way to always be there for me. They genuinely make me feel welcome every single day and handle ANY concern immediately. David the service manager makes sure what few concerns I’ve had, are handled with care and the utmost courtesy to myself and my girlfriend.  The amenities are seriously top notch! And the gym..... THE GYM here rivals the Equinox down the street. Made dumping my membership there an easy call!  Seriously could not be happier about my entire experience! As one of the first move-ins after they opened, I’ll be sure to resign in the coming months!<//Review>

I'd like to say that I have been living Metropolis for more than a year and are fully satisfied apartment.

There was some problems in the meantime, but their maintenance was always satisfied and their team was well coordinated when solving problems with other residents. (In fact, no crazy issues for the residents around my unit because they are just the best.)

Also recently just got helped to find the missing key in the elevator. I totally understood never easy to find one dropped down and elevator shaft.

It's just one of the best apartments I've stayed at in Irvine over the years!!!< /text>

Community is decent but when you move out be prepared for them to take all of your deposit.  I left my apartment in pretty damn good condition and still got charged ~$1,500 in “repair” expenses.  I have OCD and keep my apartment flawless but they’ll charge for standard wear and tear, so just be prepared.<//Text>

<text>If you ever imagined living in a “luxury” apartment that is clearly false advertisement then look no further! If you are someone who works or goes to school and wishes to have a peaceful place to come home to then you ought to think twice before investing a year or more of your life living at Metropolis Irvine. We have lived here for 7 months, 5-6 of those months have been consumed with emailing management, calling garden communities, and meeting with management. Unfortunately we were mislead into thinking this would be a nice environment to spend our little off time. This several month issue remains unresolved and we are in the dark of how much longer we will have to put up the constant stress of dealing with it. Management will reply to this and say they have been diligently working on this matter but I can assure you that they do not care that we have been suffering for most of our stay here regardless of what they say. Simply put, actions speak louder than words.
-Thinking of sleeping in at your new apartment or maybe having a quiet night at home? Good luck, not only is the sound transfer terrible but the fire alarm randomly goes off and just when you think it’s over, cover your ears because it’s not.
-STOLEN PACKAGES. We have had 3 stolen packages and spoke with another tenant who has had stolen packages as well. There is a “parcel pending” room where there are lockers for your stuff, should the lockers be full they are placed on a selfing unit..although there is a camera in the room, the office tells you sorry and to call the sender if your package is stolen.
-If you plan on always paying your rent on time, be aware that sometimes management “can not see that it’s posted” and be ready to be accused of not paying.
-Should you choose to live here be sure when going thru the checklist to notice and take photo of the poor paint jobs, marks on counters and flooring, scuffed appliances as well as bad installations of floor boards between each room. Also don’t expect them to have any flooring cleaned before you move in.
-One star because google does not allow you to do zero, the one star is for the maintenance guy Noel. He is a hard worker and a delight to have in your home. Because of several bad air conditioning installations within our apartment he has worked in our home several times. Unfortunate construction but Metropolis Irvine is fortunate to have someone like him.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>Literally the best apartment complex I have ever laid eyes on. The perfect place for me to start my life. Very convenient, the shopping center is right next to the apartments, makes furniture shopping easy for when I first move in. Good rent and lease, if you're willing to pay for what the quality is worth. I highly recommend here, had terrible experience living in Tustin Ranch they raised the rent and ripped us off.</review>< pics>

<review>So we moved into on April 1st. I have never had a community make our move so easy. We worked mostly with Natalia and she is amazing.

As for the community, it is beautiful. Our view from the 7th floor is one of the best in OC. The neighbors are all super nice who we have met. It is quiet because the walls are not super thin like other communities. You can only hear if people have people over when you walk by their doors it seems like. The pool is great and never crowded. It has a nice fitness center yet we still go to Equinox down the street but I do my cardio in the morning there. We haven’t used the bowling alley but did have friends with kids use the arcade and they loved it.

As for needed maintenance, our smoke alarm battery was beeping and they had it fixed immediately and even followed up to make sure it was. I am not sure why these people posted negative things about the maintenance on here but so far it has been amazing. They always say hello and even gave a name of a painting company to do our walls.

So to sum it up, this place is a great high end luxury complex. Everyone in the office is very nice and will help you when you need something. It’s clean, good people in here, and a great location. As for the negative reviews, I think people have a little bit too much time on their hands.< /review>< Name>

The worst. Water leak for twice, one in bedroom, one in hallway. Repair taking forever. House ants in the first month are all over. One day, you sleep and tomorrow wake up with ants on your face.  Fire alarm goes forever, Monday, Friday,and Sunday; 6 am! 10am! 5pm! Don’t fooled by their facilities. The parking structure is full of dust and never get to clean up. Elevator broken is usual routine. The worst apartment.</Review>

<time>1565907348519</time><Rate>1<//Rate><review>Lived there for a year and if I could give 0 stars I would. We have LOVED the staff everywhere we lived until here.

1. If there is ANY chance you may have to move, dont move here. There is no break lease fee (they told us 2 months rent and we would be out if my husband got a job offer we were hoping for and when it happened they laughed and said they made a mistake and that wasn't the rules and that we signed the lease so verbal means nothing..) We kept signed edocs giving them a move out date and they didnt rent our place out or even try for that matter, haha! We had friends go and pretend to look for a place and gave them our apartments EXACT info and they told them about every other apartment EXCEPT ours. They even told the office they had 6 weeks from our move out date and were flexible. When they asked if they had any on the second floor, the office told them no. THEN, we called the office the next day and they said "of course we told them about your unit" and our friends had them write down EVERY apartment they had available, and ours was not listed. We know it takes 2 weeks to clean after move out, so we gave them the date for 3 weeks from our move out date.. they just didn't tell them because they'd rather get vacant apartments rented out first before an apartment with someone liable to pay until the end of their lease.

2. WE SIGNED DOCUMENTS 3 TIMES TO MOVE OUT. I was pregnant and had my baby May 17th after a super rough pregnancy where I was hospitalized quite a bit. Well they have a rule where you have to sign move out docs 30 days before you plan to leave or they charge you rent. Well, both my dad and husband signed the documents but I forgot about them. (Had my son from c-section and have a 15 month old at home) well now they are charging us 1400 worth of rent because I didnt sign them in time even though EVERYONE else did and even though I just had major surgery a brand new newborn and a 15 month old I was taking care of. They are saying tough sh** and they don't care.

3. They also try to make your move out fee a tiny less than 1 months rent. They get you with $99 security deposit, but guess what, you still have a bill at the end now. When we got our final bill, they charged us 2945. Our rent is 2965.00 That's not just a coincidence based on what I've heard from past tenants. They charged us to completely replace carpet even though they just needed to replace a tiny spot in front of the bedroom door and a good wash would have been perfect (their own people even told us that before we left.. 1 day before to be exact.)

4. They dont take care of the property or their residents. I was 6 months pregnant and walked into their elevator and slipped on dog piss and fell. I was bleeding and almost lost my baby. I reported it to the office in the form of 3 emails, 2 phone calls and walked in 1 time. I have all of the hospital documents that show I suffered from a bad concussion from hitting my head, lots of blood loss, and problems with the baby. Still have migraines and my back and knee are still in bad shape. Both of my brothers are lawyers, as is my grandpa, aunt and uncle and everyone told me to get a lawyer but at the time I chose not to because I didnt want more stress. Well baby is here after no fetal movement and an emergency c-section and after seeing how they treated us when we finally moved out, I think I changed my mind on how to handle everything. Oh and again, NOT 1 APOLOGY from them when I fell on their property or a call asking how I was.

5. If you get locked out, it will take hours to get you back in and if it happens more than 1 time, you'll have to pay $50 for them to let you in after sitting their for 3 hours. This happened with our newborn and 15 month old and we were stuck in the hall with no food or drinks for them for 3 hours.

WORST COMPANY and I will continue posting reviews.< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1565983537880, 'text': 'Dear Barri,\n\nOn behalf of Metropolis, we sincerely regret any negative experience you reported below while at the community. The value each resident and the quality of their experience.\n\nWe are sincerely sorry to hear about your slip and fall at our community. Regrettably, management was not notified of this situation prior to your comments below and remain available to discuss any concerns you may have.\n\nWith regard to your report of friends who toured and were not notified of your apartment home as available for rent, until the Notice to Vacate is signed by you, the residence will not be shown as “available”. Please know that our management was in ongoing contact with your husband and also sent out an email reminder to sign the notice to vacate. The notice was never completed and resulted in not marketing your apartment home for rent.\n\nWe understand you are frustrated with the policy that requires move-out notices be executed 30-days prior to move-out dates. Our teams follow all California Fair Housing Laws and the terms and conditions of our lease must be upheld for all of our residents equally. Please know that management notified our customer service department of the correspondence that took place requesting the final signature, as well as sent the move-out instructions stating all signatures are required.\n\nIf you like, we are happy to send photos of the damages to the carpet that support the need for a complete replacement.\n\nShould you wish to discuss your residency further, do not hesitate to reach out to our customer service team at customerservice@gardencommunitiesca.com.\n\nWe thank you for your residency and wish you the best in your new home.'}<//response>< gmap_id>

The endless harsh fire alarms lasts for about a month and it can happen any time during a day even on weekend except for the fire alarm test. When the alarm sounds, it usually lasts 15 minutes for no reason. We can’t get a quiet rest on weekend.<//Review>

Dr. Bell has always done a great job of adjusting me. He is very personable and willing to ask questions and listen to your responses. I would highly recommend if you are a Kaiser member to come and see him. A second recommendation for him if you are a Veteran, as he offers an even better rate for Vets!</text>

Dr Bell is great! After seeing the reviews online I decided to give him a try and I must say, he is great! He’s very knowledgeable, friendly, and effective in his treatments. The staff are all very friendly and welcoming too even to walk ins. So far I have taken myself and 2 other family members here since my first visit and they have all felt very welcomed and had nothing but good things to say after their visits. Saenz Chiropractic is definitely my go-to place from now on.</text>

Had to have a physical done by the following day for my son to play high school baseball.
Walked into Saenz after 5 pm and they had him in and out in less than 30 minutes. Doctor even took the time to explain some of the dangers and how to avoid injury as a young pitcher. This happens quite a lot, actually, and it was refreshing to see a doctor down to earth enough to realize this and make an effort to keep it from happening to one more.
$15 was all it cost.....well worth it at twice the price!< /text>

I've lived here for a couple of years and don't have any complaints. It's centrally located in the heart of the best places in San Diego (Balboa Park, Seaport Village, House of Blues, Gaslamp, etc.) The apartments are modern and the concrete walls are great for blocking noise. I love my view of the city and can see the harbor, along with beautiful fireworks shows from Sea World. I'd recommend living here. Management is very friendly and helpful, especially Tina and Mar. The hallways, elevators, etc. are kept very clean also.< /Text>

My husband and I moved in about a month ago and we've loved it thus far. First of all, the leasing office staff was incredibly professional and helpful throughout the process (shout out to Marites!!). The building is lovely -- incredible amenities (sky deck with pull, gym, beautiful lobby) that are kept clean. Tenants are friendly too; mostly young people (20s/30s). I would recommend this building.<//text>

<review>I live in this building for few years and I have to say this is my home! I did think of moving to an other building and experience different downtown location but this building has so much charm., The location is fantastic, staffs are friendly and professional.

Leasing office Tina and Sarean very kind and resourceful and always ready to hear your concerns and there to help you . I can’t elaborate enough about maintaining team Mr Guillermo, which he  is my favorite of all!  He is always smiling with positive attitude and skillful. He know everyone by their names and kindling offer any help as he is able to do , his team following his leadership steps and that make you feel living close to your family, because they are trying the best to make your living as comfortable as possible. If you think of moving, this is the first place you have to visit, the charm will capture you.< /review>< resp>

From the start they are extremely helpful with moving assistance and eased with my transition. The amenities here are great and the interior of the complex is very beautiful and cozy. It is well kept on the daily with swift help from faculty if you need it.

The apartment is well-designed, organized, and maintained. The leasing office people are nice and professional, especially Marites. Overall it is a pleasant living experience so far. I would recommend this apartment to my friends.
The view from the sky garden of the apartment is amazing.<//text>

<review>100% Recommend.

I moved in back in March of 2020 just before the COVID-19 shut down, and since becoming a resident, it’s been nothing but positive for me.

Whenever I’ve emailed in with questions I’ve received a response within 1-2 hours, and most times I’ve received a response within 20-30min.

It’s a clean, well designed, and overall friendly community with a true care for their residents.

If you’re looking for a place in San Diego, I would definitely check out The REY.< /review><Response>{'time': 1616613054147, 'text': "Thank you so much for this outstanding review, Gabreral.

<Review>Love living here. At first my younger neighbors annoyed me but now they've gotten much better about the noise level.  I love that my apartment comes with a large storage and parking space. Makes living downtown more enjoyable. The elevators move fairly fast, obviously slower after 3pm when people are coming home. Trash chutes on every level. Good area of downtown and by the highways in any direction. Love that I have a washing machine in my unit. The walls are extra thick and i have a large closet. The only thing with the complex that i dont like is that there is no hot tub. They really should build one, then this would be the most perfect place to live and i would never leave. Its mostly perfect though. The staff is friendly and helpful. 9/10< /Review>< name>

Love love love living here! I’m on my second month and I leased without seeing the unit with the wonderful Norelle. She helped me relocate from Oakland to San Diego and held my hand throughout the entire time! And she continues to be such a blessing to my new home along with the Rey staff!

The building was very quiet and everyone we came in to contact with very friendly and neighborly.  The pool was amazing as was the entire rooftop with the fire pit, ping pong, bbq and TVs.  There are seriously 360 views from every angle in this building.  Another unique feature was the yoga studio that was fully equipped.  The apartment itself was super modern and pretty, loved the full sized refrigerator.  A big bonus was that we never heard our neighbors here.

<review>This is a review for Roberto Drew.

Roberto is a very kind and professional gentleman that works here at the Rey. He has helped me out once or twice when I had maintenance issues and each time he helps me out he truly treats me like family. He doesn’t approach his job as a “task” but instead as a passion project. He goes over and above to make sure that he addresses all of your concerns and works around the clock to ensure you are comfortable with the outcome.

Thank you Roberto for being part of the amazing crew at the Rey! You are appreciated.</review>< gmap_id>

Excellent place, just ensure you read application agreement disclosures. you must sign lease 3 days after approval, or will be charged 1/30 of the rent. So they will withhold 500, to cover the cost. I recommend, if you decide to rent here to ensure that the lease is signed within 3 days to avoid the additional fees. This is not a place where you can wait to look for more options, while already having the application + deposit paid.  total cost at this current time is 552 for application and deposit, just remember you will be charged more if you wait longer than 3 days to sign. Also remember after 3 days, more than likely the deposit is no longer a deposit but an expense.<//review>

<GmapID>0x80d954a6e7d8f1ed:0x3aa7e37e7fa5eec9<//GmapID><text>The leasing office in this building is a carnival of incompetence. After arriving at the building on the dot for my scheduled tour, I found the front door computer was broken and wouldn't dial the leasing office, so I waited around a minute for a resident and went inside to the leasing office, where a glassy-eyed secretary mumbled at me that "because of Fair Housing", they refused to do my tour because I was "late" (at the door of the leasing office at 5:16 for a 5:15 tour).

Luxury buildings often have frustratingly low quality staff in their leasing offices, but Berkshire Communities has managed to set a new low here. Have fun dealing with these people - you're in for a treat.</text>< name>

< Review>
The Rey is a paradise if you want to live like in a College Dorm. If you like to hear loud parties in your neighbor’s apartment instead of sleeping at night, this is your place. Also, you won't be able to use the elevators without dealing with people who do not care at all wearing a mask. Amenities are closed or restricted because of covid. It was a nice community to live in before Covid. Now, I would not recommend this if you are over 30. If you want more details, keep reading reviews here. Read Caitlin Pullen’s.< /Review>

I’m am leaving a 5 Star review because I believe that the community and the team have been underrated.

I’ve been living at The Rey since 2018 and since then I’ve had a positive experience. I never had to complaint about the living conditions in my apartment, nor needed too.

I know during this global pandemic amities are closed but that is nothing to complain about or claim for reimbursement. It’s for the safety for the persons and families that live in these close quarters. Individuals being opportunistic trying to get free rent because of health concerns is absurd and immature.

I know this from residents talking in the elevator.

It is typical that individuals that leave bad reviews did not get their way.

The quality of living at The Rey is good and The Rey team do try their hardest to accommodate. I’m thankful for that.

Overall, The Rey is a great place to live and if you ever need anything from the team I know they will help you as much as they can.</review>

<name>Caitlin Pullen</name><Review>The Rey was beautiful and classy when I moved in June of 2019. My only issue was that they hadn’t washed the windows that year. Once Covid hit in March 2020, The Rey lost its class and quickly turned into a frat house. There was little differentiation between this building and Vantage Point next door (known for partying). Both my upstairs and downstairs neighbor constantly threw ragers and blasted music at unacceptable hours of the night and morning. This behavior used to be intolerable, but expectations were quickly thrown out the window once Covid hit. Matthew Wolfe in the leasing office did his best to be as helpful as possible, and I had a good experience with him personally, but I didn’t feel as though management really did their part to help resolve. Their only suggestion was having me move to another unit. Other residents shared that management and the overall upkeep of the building had really gone downhill in the past year. A friend of mine who is about to move from The Rey said they finally washed the windows after 2 years just this week. This friend also expressed their same concerns about the party atmosphere and disrespect of other residents and is looking forward to moving out. If you want to live in a party complex, this is your place. If you’re looking for the classy Rey experience, sadly it is no longer available.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Date>

<Time>1573750315663< /Time><Text>Get ready to loose money. Definitely the kind of place that is over price. The pool area is always cold because of the altitude. For sure you will loose the deposit or even worst, they will ask you for even more money (cancellation bill for everything!). If you ask for help, be ready to pay again. There are plenty of places cheaper and with better environment than that one. I would never recommend this place.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

So impressed with Mar and the rest of the staff! From the moment I walked in the doors the entire staff made me feel like I had known them for years. Moving in was painless and everyone was so helpful. I moved in not being able to tour the apartment (cross country move) and am so impressed with how gorgeous this building is. The customer service here is about as good as it gets...The gym and roof top pool are just the icing on the cake. 5/5<//Review>

Without a doubt The REY is the most friendly, clean, and beautiful apartment building in downtown. The gym and pool are amazing plus the sky deck is always full of life. However, the place The REY really shines is in its staff. For example, Mar is without a doubt the most helpful human on earth and just a pleasure to be around. Thanks for all the help Mar!< /Review></record>

<review>The Rey is a great place to live and it was great working with Mar in the leasing office.  She knew all the questions to ask and all the information to look up to help make us the best and most educated decision on choosing an apartment.  She also provided a checklist which was helpful with staying organized and to make the process easier and simple to manage.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Maintenance Team Rocks!!!

I have been living at the Rey Apts for almost a year and I have provided reviews for the staff and the facilities. However, this time I want to acknowledge the maintenance team at The Rey.  They are simply an amazing group of people always willing to take care of any issues without hesitation. They are also very friendly and are always eager to greet you with a good morning/afternoon and a smile.  Every time I have a maintenance related concern or requirement I get an immediate answer of fix to the problem. From the cleaning person to the maintenance supervisor, thank you for all that you do on a daily basis. It does not go unnoticed. W.V.<//Review>

< review>
In any normal situation I would never leave 2 reviews for one business but since I interact with this establishment almost daily and do not live here I feel its important to share my experiences to save other from going through similar hardships. Apparently walking into this building takes away your first amendment rights to freedom of speech. I am an independent vendor that works with clients in the building and who has to give up my ID to get a temp key daily. I was told there was a meeting on a particular day and that I would need to come back in an hour to retrieve my ID even though all staff was in the leasing office and the task would have only taken 2 seconds. I expressed that I didn't have an hour to hang around and that I was not going to leave my ID with them for that amount of time and mumbled under my breath my disagreement to the situation. Especially since I have filled out the form letting them know exactly what time I will be arriving each day. Later that day I found that the staff at the Rey called my client trying to defame my character and trying to detour my client from using me by telling them there was an "issue" getting me a temp key because of my attitude. I had no idea expressing an opinion out loud gave them the right to try to get me fired from my client. Thank god my clients and all of my other clients in the building have given me options to work around having to communicate with the Rey's team because their behaviors have been inappropriate and in some cases illegal. They refuse to allow me a key to enter the front door even with proper paperwork filled out making my job that normally takes 20-30 mins almost double the time. I have even reached out asking for a way to compromise and find a solution since I come in between classes and have been told that I should embrace the motto "patience is a virtue." (by the woman who sits at the front desk) seriously, you do not want to sign a contract forcing you to deal with their remarks and believes that differ from the united states constitution for any given amount of time. So many other professional and reasonable places to live in the area who actually care about their residents and their guest.< /review>

We were so impressed with The Rey! We came in on a Saturday afternoon without an appointment and Mar in the leasing office was so helpful, she didn’t think twice about taking us in. She spent a generous amount of time working with us to understand our situation and time frame and went way above and beyond to show us all the floor plans and awesome amenities the Rey has to offer. We got such a great vibe from the community. The apartments are wonderful and the staff makes for an incredible experience. We are so excited to soon call The Rey home!<//review>

Lived here for almost two years now and have never had one issue. Rebecca and the entire staff have been very helpful and knowledgeable through a very complicated transaction with moving from one room to another room, and adding and removing roommates. Believe me, it's easier said than done. Definitely recommend this building to anyone looking for a luxury apartment.</review>

<review>Worst management team I have ever encountered.   Nothing ever works on the rooftop.  If you are lucky one firepit will work, maybe one TV and the music worked one time in the almost two years I lived there.  They defer maintenance to show corporate that her costs are down but she keeps raising the rent and fixes nothing.  And if you like the smell of pungent dog urine just take a walk ANYWHERE around the perimeter of the building.  They used to be power washed every week but as you can see deferring maintenance keeps costs down so they can raise rent costs.  And don't even try to find the sleeping security guards at night.  But that's what happens when you hire your cousin's security company.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><name>Art Perea<//name><GmapID>0x80d954a6e7d8f1ed:0x3aa7e37e7fa5eec9<//GmapID>< Date>

The second we walked in to view the Rey we were blown away at the how professional the staff was and we were impressed by the customer service that was provided to us for the duration of our tour. Mar took us in with no hesitation as a walk in and with such happiness showed us around the variety of apartments we were interested in. She genuinely showed how invested she was in our situation detailing all of our preferences and the time frames we are working with, and putting together the best solution she could provide us. She made us feel so comfortable and welcomed into the community that we cannot wait to one day call The Rey our home and would be so thankful to Mar for helping us throughout the whole process. The amenities and apartment layouts in this residence speak for themselves and overall, this location is prime real estate in the area it is located for downtown San Diego. We cannot wait to call this place home!< /Text>

<text>I don't usually write reviews - but because of the following incident I felt like I needed to, so that people would at least be aware. Last fall, we were notified that there was going to be an inspection in a week - this was normal, I didn't really think anything of it. However,  I happened to be working from home the day of the "inspection". The person knocked on my door, walked in, and glanced around for maybe 2 seconds. Then they looked at me and said "No pets, right?". That was it. I was extremely confused. I'm not an expert, but based on the research I've done landlords have to have an actual legal reason for entering your apartment, which includes an inspection. But this was NOT an inspection. They did not inspect or even look at a single thing in my apartment. They were lying to us and - potentially illegally? - entering our apartments to try to find people hiding things/breaking rules. This fake inspection made me feel incredibly uncomfortable as a resident. You should never be lying about why you are entering apartments - I'm glad that I just happened to be home that day. I even emailed Berkshire about the incident and of course got no response.

Aside from that incident, I had a pretty good experience living at The Rey. The building, the amenities, and the staff who work there are amazing, especially Rebecca. Rebecca was super helpful during my move in and the entire time we lived there, she is always friendly and goes above & beyond to make sure your needs are met. However the leasing office is definitely understaffed - when we were moving out we had to wait 30 minutes just to get my ID back since no one was at the front desk or leasing office - something I've noticed is a common thing here. There should always be SOMEONE down in the lobby when you need help, especially when you're paying this much in rent. But I still would've given this place 4 or 5 stars if it wasn't for the fake inspection.< /text>< Rate>

I can say the advertised amenities SEEM great, but they literally have the words "Fully equipped bike and surf storage" on the website, and none of the staff seem to be aware, and don't know anything about surf storage. It doesn't exist.

An elevator always seems to be broken or down for maintenance. Also the callbox at either the front door or the guest parking garage is down on a regular basis; it's worked about 4 months out of the 13 I've lived here. They changed the coffee service to only be available until 1pm (what about nurses/other people who work night shifts and want coffee at 3pm?) and they keep changing the machine yet never actually making an improvement.

I had to sign a lease 3 times prior to move-in because they got the move-in date wrong, then the move-out date wrong, then wrong again. This is funny because I mentioned the move-in date originally given in the application, and it was 13 days after the date the leasing agent said it was available. She said I'd have to pay more if I delayed my move-in. I said, ok, I'll move in on the 1st. Guess what? I was correct, the move-in date wasn't until the 13th and she didn't figure it out until 6 days prior to the 1st. Would normally be a huge issue for anyone planning a move, you think you have a place to live in 6 days and everything schedule. Oops, no, nevermind, that was wrong, but you figure it out. It's a legal agreement once signed, get it together.

They have an "inspection" of fire alarms or "other" on a regular basis, and once even expected all of the residents to be home for the entire day to accommodate the schedule and required inspection. Nope, I'm not the owner, don't inconvenience hundreds of people for the sake of "keeping office hours." Plan accordingly and get a staff member to escort the fire inspector for the week.

My lease renewal came through two months ago. I signed a new lease within 2 days. I keep getting emails that I need to renew a lease or go to month-to-month pricing. Get it together, with modern-day technology it really shouldn't be this hard.

The other day my boyfriend's car was cited in the guest parking and threatened to be towed, despite having the guest parking pass in the window for the allotted time-frame. Now we have security personnel making assumptions regarding which cars he thinks are there too often (twice a month) and "appear" to be a resident because it's there twice a month...it's a waste of my time to have to speak to the leasing office about this.

On the topic of the leasing office staff, they're not genuine at all, but put on a great face to seem helpful. I won't say they're incompetent, but their job is purely transactional, and even that they seem to have trouble with.

There are resident events which are planned/advertised without much notice. If you can make it, great, get some food and drinks, but typically not well-thought-out.

So I don't have great things to say about the building except it's a place to live.<//Review>< Pictures>

<username>Marcel Fafard</username><Date>1615779244133<//Date><rate>5</rate><Review>Update:
After moving out of The Rey I realize how much I took for granted. The staff here is very knowledgeable and helpful at all times and was amazing at solving al of our needs. The apartments themselves are very luxurious and in a safe location in downtown San Diego. There is zero noise transferred from neighbors so it very comfortable living here.  Additionally, the moveout process and fees were extremely reasonable.

Old Review:

Great location, great apartments, close to all locations in downtown the rey has been a very mixed experience.

Issues out of their control due to Covid19:
- Rooftop has been closed for 3 months
- Gym has been closed for 3 months
- Increase in homeless presence outdoors

Issues within their control:
- Windows. The windows in our apartment have not been cleaned since the day we moved in October 2019. Of course we would like to clean them but we live in a studio without a balcony so that is not a possibility.

- Dog bags, not sure if the dog bags are provided by the rey downstairs but they have been empty leading dog owners to not pick up after their pets. Not necessarily the reys fault but it seems to be stocked by Berkshire employees.

- Coffee amenity has not been stocked in a week. In times where Covid19 is preventing use of some amenities I feel that it is important to keep as many small amenities up and running as possible in a tome where covid19 is preventing gym use and rooftop access.

- Increase in rent renewal despite large number of residents moving out and general decrease in rent throughout downtown. My wife and I were looking forward to extending but were offered a rent deal that increased our rent (while realizing the rey is offering similar or better apartments at a lower rate online) Compared to other similar apartments the rey doesn’t feel like a great deal anymore.

Hopefully this gets turned around at some point.

Previous review edited on 6/8/2020 below:

I don’t usually leave reviews but I have been impressed with the services and amenities at the rey. The gym and classes provided are excellent and should be a major factor positive accounted into your rent payment.

The views from the rooftop are amazing and the location is nearby all destinations in downtown (but far enough away at the same time)

The cleaning staff keeps common areas in amazing shape and seems to be cleaned daily as I see the friendly staff every morning.

I moved here with my wife by just reading online reviews so having honest reviews was crucial in our decision.<//Review>< Pics>

They have a beautiful lobby and rooftop view with a better-than-average gym. Now that we've gotten the nice stuff out of the way...

This place was really great last year and has gone way downhill. If you have to work early in the morning, expect to need earplugs to sleep because there will be people blaring music on week-nights. Don't worry though, your noise complaint won't stop them for any longer than about 5-10 minutes.

You can always smell the marijuana in the elevators and hallways. It's actually obnoxious at times.

If you have a maintenance issue, expect a couple weeks to get your stuff replaced / fixed. Expect to have to remind the staff to do their job and try to get your stuff fixed. They will not even track those sort of things without needing to be told repeatedly.

When amenities break, don't expect them to be repaired any time soon. They've had a garage door broken for months.

Good luck to the poor soul who braves these doors. May the spoiled college kids and poor service not break your spirit.< /text>

Visited my friend during Comic Con 2018, I have never experienced such a hospitality or such an experience from any other places that feels like a 5 star hotel although it's not. If I'm going to rent an apartment in down town it's going to be The Rey.< /text>

I've been living here for about 6 months and it's about time I share my infatuation with this place. From the amenities to the staff, I've been impressed. The rooftop is one of the best in San Diego (I tour new apartments regularly) and REBECCA in the leasing office is hard working & enthusiastic.

Pros:
Gym
Rooftop
Pool
Cleanliness
Staff
Parcel Service
Lobby
Free coffee

Nothing is perfect, so to be fair...

Cons

-With so many people living here the leasing office can sometimes be a little slow to get back to you. The application process wasn't as smooth as you'd think.
- most of the building facing west have no view besides the symphony building
-ground level sound travels up every now and then that can be loud
_slow elevators

Overall these quirks are outshined by everything else.< /Text>

As we have just been deployed to San Diego and I was referred to the rental by a friend who previously stayed in it. I guess things change as do managements, not sure about that, but if you see a change in attitude then you know why.  They keep you on hold for minutes, and strangely I could see them not answering my calls from the road as the office faces the road. Anyhow look at Pt Loma a bit more conducive to our needs avoid this joint.</Text>< pics>

<rating>1< /rating><text>The apartment building is beautiful but the maintenance staff and building services managers are terrible. I was locked out of my apartment for two hours because building took my key for safe keeping then misplaced it. When I returned to the building it was after hours. I was given no help and left with nothing but a generic phone number to call for emergency service then had to wait for 2 hours before getting access to my apartment. Not the kind of service you expect when paying $2445 a month for rent!<//text>< name>

Cheap materials used in construction.  Management seems to intentionally not fix things on the roof deck to keep its use down.  Dog Feces and Urine in the elevator regularly.  Almost no guest parking (they will lie about having plenty, but don’t ever expect it)

Poorly constructed, & poorly managed.  A noise complaint will strip you of your ability to invite guests over to enjoy the Amenities.

No hot tub.  about 25% military, lots of students and foreigners.   Not as advertised at all.< /review>

My husband and I have been living at The Rey for a month now and couldn't be happier.  We started our journey looking at The Rey a couple of months ago.  Rebecca was our initial contact and she was very professional and easy to work with.  The office and maintenance staff can make or break a building.  I have to say they have totally made the experience amazing so far.  Guillermo and Roberto from the maintenance staff are so happy and they always make sure their team finishes work requests in a timely fashion. Rebecca, Mar, Ryann and Paula from the office remember everybody's name and really make you feel like you have found your home at The Rey.  The rooftop pool is heated, bbq's are clean and work great.  The residents are #1 at The Rey!<//text>

<review>I am thrilled to call The REY my new home! The facilities and amenities are one of the best downtown has to offer and the green roof (SkyDeck) has stunning views and a great atmosphere. Location is amazing with less than a 5 minute walk to Donut Bar, Taco Stand, Dog Haus Biergarten, and WeWork building.

Rebecca and Mar at the Leasing Office were super friendly and welcoming and provided an excellent customer experience. If you are planning on moving to downtown, definitely check this place out!< /review>< Rating>

<username>Caroline C</username><Date>1526971650616</Date><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Love The Rey! It has a great balance of people. Not boring but also not a frat house. The management puts on awesome events on the roof top which has the best views in San Diego. I can’t help but laugh at some of the previous comments about parking. This is one of the few places downtown that includes an assigned space with your apartment. If you park in your assigned spot and not the guest parking (because you are too lazy to DRIVE to your space) you won’t have issues. Follow the rules...what a concept. The new management has been here about 2 months now and is a great change! They communicate well and do their best to be as fair and accommodating as possible, within reason of course. Naturally, as you read some reviews you will spot the whiners who are never satisfied with anything and let ok forntjings to complain about, the irresponsible’s who loose their keys and have the audacity to complain of the “inconvenience” of waiting when it’s after hours to be let in (how about the inconvenience YOU caused the on call person in the middle of the night by being negligent with the key to your home) and the offended’s who don’t like being held accountable when they are clearly violating the rules they agreed to follow when signing their lease....*facepalm*. All in all The Rey is the best value for your dollar in San Diego...great location, awesome amenities, clean environment and a great staff who cares. I highly recommend it.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
We have been renting in different apartments/complexes. This means we have worked with several community management groups. But we have had a very vary pleasant experience with Berkshire Community group, especially The Rey apartments in San Diego and the Aire apartments in San Jose. I will explain why/how. We were renting in the Aire in San Jose and we still had 6 months to the end of my lease that we had to move to San Diego due to job relocation. However, the management in the Aire (Marzieh) was kindly helped us through the process of re-renting from the other Berkshire community group in San Diego (The Rey) to avoid paying any extra fee. Further, they didn't deduct unreasonable amount from our deposit for cleaning (actually it was the least I have ever paid and very clear charges).
At the Rey in San Diego, we had so much fun in the apartment and its amenities. Further, it was always easy to fix a little issues since the management team is VERY responsive, helpful, and responsible. Again for our second lease there was a situation that we had to break our lease and leave to different location. in this situation I was communicating with the management team (Sarah and Justin) to try to rent out our apartment ASAP to avoid paying any fee. It was not the easiest time, but again thanks to Sarah and Justin (and the whole team) we had a very smooth transitioning and our apartment was rented out in less than a week (which means we ended up paying the minimum breaking lease fee).

All in all,  we had a great time living in both Berkshire communities. I believe the main reason is that their staff are very nice and helpful and they have a great culture of customer service.</Review>

We are overwhelmed with thankfulness for the call center appointment scheduling, the administrators, nurses, doctors, intake staff and volunteers for offering my husband and I COVID vaccines.  This location is so very organized. There was little or no line wait time on vaccine day,  vaccine appointments were made BY PHONE and CALLS RETURNED with a clear appointment time from wait lists, staff met arriving patients at the curb or at their transport offering wheelchair assistance when needed.  Intake paperwork was filled out by patients seated amply apart, with repeated offers of assistance, all under an open tent cover.   Intake paperwork processing staff were spaced at computers around the borders of an open lot. Names were called in order for intake, then we entered the building for vaccine steps.  The whole thing was so well organized and very low stress This group of professional, caring and competent medical professionals were AMAZING. The work they do daily saves lives.  My father gave his life to practicing medicine and then lost his due to COVID late December 2020.. My husband and I repeatedly tried everything to receive vaccines for the past several months.  Only Family Medical Centers offered us this care. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU to everyone having a part in this, including the State  of California's release of more vaccines to clinics like Family Medical  You really will never be forgotten by us!</Text>

I was trying to contact my GP today on an urgent matter. There is apparently no way to contact my clinic directly, as the "direct" number actually dials the call center rather than clinic reception or nurse station...I've spent close to an hour and a half on calls to these various numbers, and it seems there is nobody actually working or physically present at the Hillcrest clinic location...I've left messages at the nurse station asking for an urgent callback, no answer or response. The first voice-mail msg I left was almost 5 hours ago...I have since tried to get ahold of reception, again, no answer, just endless ringing on my end.. if I had a way of actually getting to the Hillcrest location, I wonder if I would find anyone actually physically there.. ?? Are they maybe in some kind of danger, I'm not really sure what to think...its more than a little crazy sounding, but what the hell is going on over there..?
My experiences with the call center were even worse, as nobody there could get ahold of anyone at Hillcrest fhc either, and instead of helping me out they would just xfer me despite my repeated requests that they not do that....

My first concern is the safety of the employees at Hillcrest fhc, but if all is well in that regard, then the family health center system has huge problems in their entire setup and way of doing business...< /text>

Honestly all these places should just be shut down. If i could give no stars i would. Me and my family have all come to these clinics and only ever have had 2 good doctors. No one else cares about your well being here and you're treated like a dead beat from start to finish. If you aren't scheduled with Fink or Turner your chances of getting any type of help are slim to none. They DO NOT CARE if you are out of medication, in pain or have a hard time getting there due to your age or disability, and they DO NOT CARE if not seeing a doctor immediately puts your life in danger. I really dont understand how there can be so many people with jobs that are supposed to care for people and they could care less.< /Text>

I kept calling them many times in separate occasions regarding my mom's injectable medication for her bones and blood pressure medication for refill. She missed taking those medications for 2 weeks already. They just responded today. It took them 2 weeks to do that. This is so concerning because what if something may happen to the patient because of their being NEGLIGENT? This is totally unacceptable. I hope the  management will to do something about their very bad service.<//text>< pics>

Family Healthcare Center of National City. I'm giving it 2 stars because the front desk receptionist and the nursing staff are very nice and professional. However I saw Dr M.Lanuza. He came in very sluggish, wearing tyedyed slippers and was very rude. He disrespected my nerve condition. He perscribed Ativan for me and said I hate perscribing stuff like this so you better not come back and ask for more because I won't give it to you. Making me feel like a total junkie. I had a very unpleasant experience and I'll never ever see this Dr again! You guys should really treat your patients with MORE RESPECT.<//text>

They assigned me a new provider. He took me off my ADHD Meds and upped my anti-deppresant. My whole life is falling apart but once the anti deppressnt kicks in I probobly won't even care or be deppresed about it. It's absolutely genius. That's why folks in Mental Health Care earn the big money.</Text>

Seems like I have trouble connecting with counseling. I make an appointment for mental health whether it's been offered to me or whether I've asked for it I've always been turned down in a roundabout way usually when it gets time for my appointment they cancel or they don't show up or they direct me to the wrong place or some other darn thing.< /Review>

I cannot express enough of how amazing FHCSD is! From the smooth and efficient operations to the quality of its staff, I have had premium service. I am grateful for this organization and all it does for those underprivileged.</Text>

I've seen Glenn Miller, DPM twice now and I believe he's a quack.  The first time I saw him two years ago, I asked for a referral for a second opinion and was not happy when the same person walked in.  Same story.  I still would like a second opinion.  How can I do that?</Text>

In my opinion, this is one of the better options for patients on MediCal- they are not scheduled out too far in advance, and you have immediate access to counseling and to physical therapy if you need it since FHC offers all three.  Their follow-through could be improved upon though: the doctor wrote a prescription that has yet to arrive to my pharmacy (~2 weeks).<//Text>

Good Healthcare. They take Medi-cal, I was surprised How clean and organized they are. Not too much waiting. The only negative is the Doctors don't seem to stay very long.<//review>

I'd leave NO stars but they won't allow that. This place is HORRIBLE! I used the Hillcrest location. Their Doctors are young but good, I assume they are using FHC as a steppingstone for a REAL job due to the high turnover I witnessed in my short 8 months that I have been going to them. It seems to me that a good portion of the staff is completely inept. They NEVER seem to be able to solve many of the little problems that arise and ALWAYS tell me they will call back with the solution...They NEVER do. I called them for 4 days straight just to get prescriptions refilled and was unsuccessful. Then the weekend set in and here it is on Tuesday of the next week and still no medications yet!   I just can't help but wonder how some of the people in this organization are able to maintain their jobs. This organization seems to put profits way above patients needs. The doctors are limited by a fixed time allotment per patient (15 minutes) and it is extremely detrimental to good patient care. I will never go back to this assembly line they call  a health center!<//review>

<text>I go to City Heights and in the Past 2011 I went to Chase. Although there are problems especially with wait times during busy times and Parking issues All  centers,  they have.. City Heights been making improvements. Short on staff ..unexpected flu season,etc., is human oversight on the shift scheduler or admin dept., that even after careful planning can take a turn because boop happens! AVOID making appointments on days you are short on time...make sure you have an hour past your sheduled appt time to prevent anxiety of running out of waiting time...example making appt one hour before you have to pick the kids up from school...that would be YOUR fault for not allowing Ample time. Usually they are on time for most part. Some responsibility is the Patients, like speaking up...kindly go up to the front desk if youve been waiting 15 minutes and for heavens sake.. especially if you have been waiting 30 min or more. KINDLY tell the front desk clerk you have been waiting xx-minutes past your appointment time and ask how much longer you can expect to wait.  They will explain the situation give you a wait estimate and attempt to get you seen at earliest time possible. They will try to accommodate you with the next available provider if possible to do so. AS FOR MEDICATION REFILLS...It has ALWAYS been their policy to never prescribe Renewals over the phone! You have to see the doctor...aka an appointment with the doctor/provider IS Necessary! I have been to Logan Heights few of their other clinics as well.
I have run into some issues at a few of the clinics but 99% of the time the staff are awesome. Overall a good Low Cost Clinic. No Pharmacy. Not a hospital. But a Clinic with Nurse Practitioners Physician Assistants and limited M.D.s.<//text>< GmapID>

I called in March to make dental appointments for my daughters at the same clinic they always go to. I show up today and they say there are no appointments and then they go on to say one of my daughters has never attend the clinic..  Like im crazy or something. As if i dont know where i take my children. I call in to complain about my experience. And the staff was very rude. And was trying to place blame on me. There was not a direct number when i called to make the appointments back in March. When i talked to the oprarter she transfered me i told her the location where i wanted to go then she transfered me. So i assumed i was talking to the right people!! Plus the place i always take them to, keep saying shes never been there i have a teenager and even she said she had been there even said hello to one of doctors she recognize passing by.  Its super annoying and inconvenient that no apology was made to me..<//Text>

I would not recommend this health care to anyone. They really don't care about their patients at all. I have been in pain for almost 5 months and nothing has been done and when I call it does not matter to them. They pawn me off on someone else in the company that does not care either.<//Text>

<Text>Horrible experience, I I could give it 0 stars I would. My appointment was at 3:00... it is now 3:32pm and they have not even acknowledge the fact that Im here waiting... they tell you to come in 15 mins before your appointment to ensure timely service and its like they dont care that you arrive early and leave you waiting. This is not the first time it happens. I have waited as long as 4 hours and that was while I was pregnant. They have no regard for peoples time or pain. It is ridicolous. I you can go somewhere else do it I will after this.<//Text>< pics>

I asked the guy behind the counter to check my tires cause my car was wobbling and  I told him I need tires. We go out to my car and he runs his hands over the tires and says "you need tires ",duh I know this. I ask him which tire is the one causing my car to wobble and he says all of them. I drive up to my daughter's and I tell her husband and he looks at my car and says your lucky to make it here. I look and see a big chunk of tire missing. How did that guy miss it ? Cause he did not check them right.< /Review>

< Review>
Great customer service and very proactive in finding a solution for their clients. I have been to my fair share of tire shops/mechanic shops and I am used to the hard sale. Mac's Tire Pros come from a place of contribution and put their customers first and do not force the "hard sale" on you so you can make educated decision on your vehicle needs.</Review>

We think it's important to be solution oriented, and to put the customer's needs before anything else.  Our goal is to get you back on the road, and we're so glad we were able to do this for you!  Hope to see you in again, soon."}</Resp>< GmapID>

Always quality, friendly and fast service. Even though I could find places for example who change oil cheaper, this place does it fast and rotate your tires anyway you want for no extra charge.
Staff is knowledgeable and polite.< /text>

These guys know their stuff compared to store chains. I was referred to this shop by 559Yotas. At first I was hesitant because I've been chasing my alignment problem for years. Been to many big name shops and been told everything is in spec. Even Toyota dealer said the same thing. I went to Mac's by chance because I called a store on Shaw and Fowler. They told me to come in only to find out the tech guy just went out to lunch. I was upset for wasting my time. So i decided to call Mac's Tire. Price was cheaper than the shop I first went to. So I went and spoke with the gentleman there(Rodney) and immediately I was impress with his knowledge. Go to any shop and they would just say we'll check to see if it is in spec. But that didn't solve my problem. Rodney told me what should work better for my truck and had his tech do his magic. Man, I've been wanting to get rid of my truck for so long and Mac's tire changed all that. Truck drives fantastic.< /text>

Awesome staff! This shop is like in-n-out for cars! Came in today for a cmc replacement, and some minor issues the dealership wanted $800 out of me for just 3 jobs! Came into Mac’s and they took care of it for $600 less than what the dealership asked for. They also wanted my car overnight and I had to be somewhere the next day.

< review>
Mac's Tire has done a great job for me.  They have good products and good service.  I'm a local contractor and they've done all my tires for 5 different vehicles over the last 10 years.  I especially appreciate that they are a local company!  Rodney is customer service orientated and does everything he can to take care of your tire and service needs.<//review>

I had to have my oil pan and axel boot fixed and was recommended by my boyfriends dad that this was the place to go too, Rodney has always been super friendly to me and I feel like I can really trust Macs. It was also very affordable I will always take my car here.. not your typical mechanic that tries to charge you for anything<//Text>

Mac's Tire was the best price in town, for dismount, and mount our tires. Excellent customer service, minimal wait time.< /Text>

< Review>
I've been going to Mac's tires for almost 30 years. I popped a tire and scraped a rim in a rainstorm back in the 80s and I needed to replace a Michelin tire. Mac's was one of the few distributors in the area at that time. I came over and met Doug McKinney. He set me up with a tire but he also set me up with someone to polish the rim for 10 bucks. I've been coming back ever since. It's Doug's son Rodney's shop now but it's still the same great service in Old Town Clovis started by his grandfather Mac McKinney back in 1950. I highly recommend you stop by.< /Review>

These guys had the tire I needed same day, only spot in town I found Hankooks winter tires for my Subaru. Had them mounted and balance with no galling (cannot say that about all shops here in town) same day, and when I paid, turns out they quoted me a slightly higher price so I walked out the door 25$ richer than expected. Locally owned so please support them.</text>

<Review>We placed our order (#8082713) on May 24th @ 5PM ET and approved the proof within an hour of the request. Further, we paid for a Rush Order (Production Time, 6 - 8 Business Days), totaling $#,###.##

As of June 7th, more than ten days of Production Time, we have received no status regarding the delay and now see that the order was discounted and placed within the normal production cycle. Our company remitted payment and secured an agreement with UPrinting for Rush Order services, and at no point neither authorized nor approved a change in the terms of cost and payment, however, our order now reflects this unauthorized change.

We contacted Customer Service to inquire about our order and was informed that we would receive a Callback in approximately 12 hours from the point of the call. Additionally, the production team representative asked "when do we need the order?", to which we informed her that we required the order today.... Then the call was promptly disconnected.

As a result of the delay we will not be able to fill pending orders or provide sales teams with the new sales kit boxes. If we were made aware that UPrinting could alter the terms of our agreement without notice, delay delivery without notice and take any action that could impact our ability to delivery products to our customer, we would have certainly selected a difference vendor.

The noted review/rating may be revised upon any action taken by UPrinting.< /Review>< rate>

I purchased over $500 of stickers that were advertised as "...long lasting vinyl, perfect for outdoor use."    The colors fade so quickly, it's embarrassing to give them out.  UPrinting doesn't stand behind their product.</Review>

Ordered on Feb 10, 2021
Received order on April 16,2021.
Placed an order for 5000 take out menus plus $75 for design fee. It took them two months to finish designing this menu from start to finish. Time is money and they are wasting a lot of my time and money. They wanted to charge me for the 4th revision when the designer didn't follow my instructions over and over again. I don't know what's going on over at their design department but they are definitely losing a lot of money because of them since they are absolute GARBAGE. The head of their design department needs to be replaced. They refunded me a total of $100 out of my $650 order. I wait for the revision but I didn't get anything until I called them, then they took  4 or 5 days for the revision when they said the turnaround time is 1-2 business days. I had to keep calling them to get the job done or else I won't get it until next year. The quality of the color of the print is definitely low quality and dull looking. They don't resemble the color of the actual pictures used.  Definitely will not use this company again. DEFINITELY AVOID THIS COMPANY AND NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS WILL I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.

Edit: Amber gave me a call and offered $100 store credit and offered to waive the hardcopy fee of $25 if I request it. I will give them one more star for her exceptional customer service and aftermath clean up.< /Review>< Pictures>

I was reluctant to use Uprinting over vista print but I needed to because they had an option for a person to review my file and fix anything necessary for no charge. The product arrived 1 week before it was scheduled to arrive. The problem was it didn’t arrive at the right location. FedEx said they delivered but we have cameras and there was no FedEx delivery that day. Instead of waiting until FedEx finished their investigation (still not finished 2 weeks later), uprinting offered to reprint same day and overnight the printing at no cost. Exceptional customer service! Thank you for making someone else’s mistake right.</text>

<Date>1618246483927< /Date><rate>2<//rate><Review>Really loved the way my prints came out but the way they were packaged was so bad. After I picked them up curbside and opened it up the way they were rolled left so many creases in my prints. It was really disappointing because the prints themselves looked beautiful and the image was such great quality but god they jus looked so beat up even though they were wrapped in plastic & bubble wrapped. I’ve tried to smooth out the creases but even in frames they still show especially when they catch the light. I have a few other things I’d love to print out in the future and maybe I jus got unlucky this one time but I feel a little hesitant to use this company in the future

<text>I used UPrinting for a recent job of printing some custom postcards. This crew was awesome. He was totally patient, knew everything inside and out, and allowed us to make adjustments right up until the time we actually went to print. And the resulting product? Eye-popping colorful fantastic goodness. I definitely recommend him.</text><rating>4</rating><user>116492788799038027213< /user><time>1607676174165<//time></record>

This company has very bad customer service. VERY BAD. You can easily get a good price for the business cards or brochures. They still come with rough edges and some even look sloppy. I'm surprised the "owner" (Neha S) responds here - I guess it's the only place she does her customer service. All the phone calls are outsourced - spoke to people in the Philippines, and India.
My issue was with a box that I ordered - back in December 13th; It is now February 9th. I put in the specks for the box and would not let me download a template for my box. The good news is that "U Printing" has an online solution for that. You can upload your images to the site - BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY FIRST!!! So, we did - $895.
I had to design every part of the box and upload them individually. I uploaded them how they wanted - CMKY and 300dpi. I have been working with graphics for over 15 years - I thought it was an insult when they told me that my images weren't 300dpi. Anyway, I spoke to a "rep" - and I couldn't understand her - she had a very heavy accent. She said she had to transfer me to another department - the "corrugated packaging department" - because she had no idea what I was talking about. So here I go, to the next department. Same story - she was confused. She was asking me for a single file, I told her I uploaded over 10 files. I said: I used the U Printing website to upload my files. Her response was outraging: what is U Printing? She had no idea what the hell U-Printing was. This company is outsourcing everything.
Listen Neha, I'd rather pay more knowing that I'm dealing with a company who actually cares for its customers. This company outsources it's printing jobs and customer service issues.< /Text>

I have ordered 5000 booklets and give them away for free. When I run out I re-order them again and again. They assist with editing the contents and rearranging the text. This is totally amazing to me because I do not know how to get it done. They are helping me so much to "SPREAD YOUR MESSAGE"
UPRINTING IS THE BEST.</Review>

Very Reasonable pricing on the product. Shipping cost a little on the high side but they offer the use of your own shipping account if you have one to cut down on that cost. Very fast delivery. Ordered on Wednesday . . . Arrived 3 days later! Very happy with how both of my indoor vinyl banners with finished edges and grommets turned out.   Everyone at our church conference was very impressed.  One of the banners was displayed in the sanctuary in front of the pulpit.<//Review>

BAD BUSINESS!!!!!!!!! I paid for 2 wall decals. I received 1 in the mail. The other was on proof hold. Being that it was on hold, I was unaware that UPrinting would take my money without calling me with proper notification. I called to resolve the issue. The rep told me she fixed the issue and I would receive a full store credit of what I paid. Hours later, I received an email saying UPrinting wasn’t able to credit me because too much time had gone by. That policy is BS! People pay their hard earned money and this is what they get in return.<//text>

I waited with expectation for the package not knowing if my photo printing would turn out. The package came on scheduled date in a very secure package, and I was completely surprised at the contents. You all did a fantastic job as this photo was the headboard for my beached themed motor home. I highly recommend you all and will be a loyal customer in the future. Thanks so much! JoAnna</Review>

The paper was thick and the printing was good! Exactly what I was looking for, for my RSVP cards,  envelopes and registry information. Could not find the option for those at any reasonable price anywhere else. They also will not let you submit something unless you approve it so that means you get to double check your own work with a fresh set of eyes! Which means you are not going to pay for something done wrong! I will recommend to anyone I know getting married!<//Review>

Our final product was gorgeous. I ordered boxes for my client and she was more than pleased which made the wait time worth it. I was fortunate enough to talk to very knowledgeable people at Uprinting who answered all my questions. Very impressed with the quality of the boxes and the service. Thank you Uprinting. I will definitely keep you in mind for future projects.</review>

< Review>
I had ordered too many and had to call customer service to adjust the quantity. TOP NOTCH CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! Not only was it easy and hassle free but the service agent took the liberty to review the order. Thank GOD he did because i made so many mistakes. I recommend the "Review option"
it took less than 24 hrs and it saved me big in the long run. i was able to fix what i didn't like with my images and move forward in a very timely manner.
It PRINTED AND SHIPPED ON TIME!
it came in a very well protected box.
the only thing  was the invites and  the RSVP cards were a shade off, but later seen that it was my mistake.  ....

in all of this..
they were still very  consistent with the over the top customer service.
i had a problem and when i called they made it their problem.
They reached put to me 2 times by phone and once by email. just to make sure i was okay with the order. ABOVE AND BEYOND UPRINTING!!!!!!
PERMANENT CUSTOMER HERE!</Review>

"Great customer service; they were patient, helpful and answered all of my questions. The complimentary digital proof they sent me to approve was also appreciated, although the concern by the pre-press team over the quality of the print, which was somewhat a valid point, was both intentional on my part (elements of the image appeared "degraded" for aesthetic effect). I still approved it, as I do design work and am familiar with setting up files according to spec; however, that notation left me a little uneasy until my order arrived several days later and I was able to verify that everything was fine. Still, I'd have them err on the side of caution, but perhaps articulate their concern a bit more clearly so that I'm able to communicate about the artwork with them."< /Text>

UPrinting hit the design right on the money. I love the look along with the waterproof label and glossy overlay. The only problem was with one of my labels that the ingredients were wrong. I emailed and tookpictures of how it was supposed to read besides what was on the label and UPrinting corrected it immediately and sent me new labels. It was there mistake and I didn't have to repay for the product. I will definitely be using them for my other labelsthat I need coming up in the near future.

I have ordered 3 different labels and all of them are perfect. Fast service just like they say. All of my logos are centered perfectly and look amazing. Also - the label washes off my jars so easily! I was worried I'd have to scrape and treat...but they just came clean off in the wash but not before the time was upon them. Yay!<//Review>

My first batch were so fantastic and well priced I decided to order again when I changed my card design.  The second batch was 2-sided, both sides horizontal layout.  Well, I thought I had followed the instructions but when I received the cards the back-side had been printed upside-down.  I alerted them of the issue thinking it was my error and figured I would just use the cards anyway, but their customer service reached out to me right away and offered to re-print and ship again for free.  AMAZING!!  And sure enough within 3 days I had new perfect cards.  Anyway, can't express my gratitude enough.  Love love love UPrinting!!!<//text>< time>

<review>Labels are things you don't want to print wrong. I appreciated the thoroughness of wanting to get them to look exactly how I wanted. It required many phone calls and emails back and forth, but it was worth it. Product looks great!< /review>< Gmap_id>

<review>I placed an order for 1000 bookmarks (2-sided), but had several design changes requested by my client throughout the process after I first submitted the order. The customer service folks were outstanding in every way - extremely professional, courteous, patient, and accommodating. They worked with me until the very last minute to make sure the design was just right while ensuring that I would still get the bookmarks in time (which I did). On top of that, the bookmarks came out beautifully and were of professional quality. I will definitely be using UPrinting services in the future!</review>< pictures>

Great people,  great service, great quality. I was first attracted by their web interface, easy and intuitive. After the first few orders it was easy to see that they are a great printing company. They are always available to answer any questions I have, but most of the time it's point, click, and in short order have a high quality product at my door.< /Review>

Excellent experience.  I sent them a picture I wanted blown up and they had some concerns about the quality of the image and the way it would appear when it was enlarged.  I reviewed their concerns and told them to go ahead with the printing.  I am happy with the final product and it looks great hanging outside my classroom.

Took them 5 days to do the "12 hr" review, putting me way off schedule. Then they cancelled it with no description. I had to start the whole process over. Then the review they finally gave me was cryptic. I ended up having to cancel. And the refund cannot be processed until the manager contacts me? As if I have time for that. Very frustrated. Cannot recommend.</review>
<Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1558558747476, 'text': 'Hi Christie,\n\nThank you for providing feedback about your recent experience with us. I am sorry to hear you had concerns with our proofing process. We definitely strive to post proofs within the time frame quoted, however, there can be delays due to the artwork submitted. For example, if prepress has to make any adjustments such as resizing or adding bleed, this will delay the proofing process.\n\nWe do not count weekends or holidays towards proofing or production time, only business days. Rejections of posted proofs or requests to make changes and/or upload new files, will start proofing time over.\n\nI was able to review the order and discovered prepress reached out via phone and email to discuss the disapproval notes posted. We advised the adjustments in the disapproval notes could not be made by us and we requested for new, print ready files to be uploaded.\n\nThe order was cancelled due to the account holders request.  A refund was processed the same day.\n\nThank you for considering us for your printing needs. We hope we are able to work with you in the future.\n\nThank you,\n\nCustomer Care'}< /Response>< gmapID>

<Text>I am putting together a birthday party for my boyfriend. We are pretty dorky and the theme is something not many people seem to have done before. These labels let me create an awesome party favor I know everyone will love. Very clear, clean, high quality printing. I went with vinyl to keep from worrying about water damage or fading over time. It looks so good. I can't gush enough.

We order thousands of dollars in products every year. Their TOP manager, told us they dont mind losing our business because of an quantity error. They still have the plates to print the artwork but choose not to address the issue. Not good business.< /Text>

I've used Uprinting for making postcards, business cards, and even vinyl banners, and it's been wonderful. In every instance, the quality has been great and delivery was prompt.

I have limited time so being able to have life chat online was extremely helpful.  Customer service helped customize my current logo with ease and they even suggested ways to use less ink which reduced our final price greatly.<//review>

Been ordering from UPrinting for a couple years now. Called them up not knowing anything about headers or what to order. They walked me through my order and received exactly what I needed. Never been disappointed, always received my orders on time with top notch quality.< /Text>

Happy to see the custom beer labels I ordered from them are really strong and durable—not like the paper kind most breweries use that fall to pieces when they go in the cooler. These custom labels looked awesome for our wedding homebrew, and they helped me turn around a spelling correction super quickly as well.< /text>

Needed a 16 page booklet 4/4 done fast.  Not only did they do it quicker than promised but helped me catch several errors in the prepress stage that enhanced the overall quality of my piece.   I now recommend uprinting to my friends< /Text>

I bought flat inviatations for my wedding a few weeks ago. I am so happy with the quality of the inviatations and the customer service given by UPrinting. My only complaint is the shipping was expensive. I will definitely be recommending UPrinting tobrides who are trying to save some money on their invites.<//review>

UPrinting has never failed to send me quality printing jobs in a very reasonable timeframe. I've had them print multiple business card designs for my clients, feather flags for events at our local harbor, and gift certificates for another client. Honestly, the printing jobs I've received have looked far better than those I've seen by another very well known printing company. I will continue to use UPrinting for any foreseeable jobs.< /Review>

<Review>We have been using Uprinting to grow our non-profit for the last two years.  We have made dozens of orders from flyers to custom banners and have appreciated the quality and customer experience that UPrinting provides.  We first tried UPrinting for the competitive prices but became customer for life because of the exemplary customer experience we received.  We can count on Uprinting to get us our orders without delay.  They have been very flexible and even on occasion when we messed up an order UPrinting was still able to help us with a reprint.  We appreciate UPrinting helping us spread our message and grow our business. Matt Nelson Project My Neighborhood< /Review>< pictures>

I am a Photoshop hobbyist, working with pictures I have downloaded from the Library of Congress collections. The 2 photos made into posters byUPrinting were originally scans of photos (made from 4"x5" negatives, probably from a Speed Graphic press camera) taken in 1942 of the old New York City El trains. They were both in pretty bad shape and required a lot of painstaking retouching, butit got done, and UPrinting produced 2 giant posters that look great framed on my den walls; they made all the work well worth the effort.<//Text>< Date>

I've ordered numerous items from UPrinting and EVERYTHING has been amazing. The banner that I just received exceeded my expectations. I hope UPrinting makes Tshirts soon. Aloha!</review>

very unreliable. failed on its promise. we uploaded our artwork - and although uprinting promises 6 hour response time, we heard nothing back. had to follow up in two days and cancel the order.</Review>

I just got our business brochures. Low quality! We're so disappointed. The folding was done haphazardly and had print marks that did not belong in the original design. Also the print-out was not the same as the approved brochure. Some elements moved. I called customer service back and they are still working out what can be done, but I am ready to just get a refund now and find a better printer.</Text>

<Review>I have received several products from U Printing including a stretched canvas, business cards, note cards, wall graphic, poster print, etc. Each and every time I have been blown away by the amazing quality that I've received! They are extremely customer oriented and the one time I did have a problem they fixed it as soon as possible. I would highly recommend them to anyone and gave several prints from them as Christmas gifts last year!</Review><Name>Nicole Elliott<//Name></record></dataset><record>

I ordered 100 4x6 postcards on 14 pt gloss paper for Datelytics, but was sorely disappointed upon receiving the package. I had a chat with the online service representative about the postcard format once before, and was reassured the file I sent would be printed correctly. Once I opened my package of postcards, I saw that they weren't clear and defined as compared to the online proof. You could clearly see misprints, random boxes, and not fitted the same way for all orders. I called customer service to complain about the postcards, and they decided to send me another one to fix their mistakes. Sadly, the new batch was exactly the same as the first. Guess I will be going with a different service for printing.<//review>

I got crooked printed business cards with scratches in them.  They look horrible.  I called "customer support" and was treated poorly and told they would get back to me in 24-48 hours with what they were going to do.  The print quality is below average, and the stock is cut sloppily.  I cannot give these cards to my customers.  READ their terms carefully before ordering, they guarantee quantities within 10%, meaning you could pay for 1000 and get 900.</text>

DO NOT PURCHASE HERE!! They outsource their print and can’t even get the print done with the time estimated. Ordered a backdrop told me I can pick up at 4p. I’m here and now they’re saying they don’t know where it’s at??? For reals?</Text>

(Translated by Google) The work is of the worst quality, every time you tear off the original sheet of the receipt, the copy comes off, the paper is very ordinary and does not even include the telephone number or other business information, terrible, terrible, I do not recommend it at all if there was one way to return this lousy job I would, very expensive for what I received.

(Original)
De la peor calidad el trabajo, cada vez que le arrancas la hoja original del recibo la copia se despega, el papel my corriente y ni siquiera incluye el teléfono u otra información del negocio, pésimo , pésimo , no lo recomiendo para nada si hubiera una forma de regresar este pésimo trabajo lo haría, muy costoso para lo que recibí.< /review>

Mark showed up and was truly a pleasure to work with. His upbeat personality and love of his job really showed. I was helping my elderly mother whose garage door was on its last leg. Mark worked his magic and was able to get her a quality door above what was expected and installed today. He ran into several road blocks but did not give up until he made it happen. I appreciate his tenacity and his professionalism. Everyone was great and we couldn’t be happier. Great company and great customer service by everyone involved. Gabriel and Jesse deserve Kudos also. Great guys!< /Review>< pics>

Precision was the 2nd company I called and the 1st company didn't make the appointed time. So I decided to call Precision. James arrived on time made sure everything was comfortable and safe sold me on the best system, and was finished under time and under budget...

My best advice is you want the best call Precision and ask for James...< /text>< Pictures>

Both times I had different technicians and repairs were made to different garage doors, but both were completed professionally, on time, and both doors work like new. I was very happy with the technicians, James and Chris, and with the office staff. Very easy to work with and the work done was correctly and more efficiently than I expected. Thank you. Will definitely use again.<//Review>< pictures>

Great service and the end product was exactly what we wanted..... A very quiet door when it opens and closes.  The Tech Josh was super knowledgable and pleasant to speak to. I would honestly recommend Precision to anyone looking to get a great product and installed in a reasonable amount of time.

<text>Justin Brown called ahead and arrived on time to address what turned out to be warranty work on my opener. He was very polite and organized and quickly diagnosed the problem with the opener. I appreciated that Justin answered all of my questions and had the parts in his truck to make the repair. It was great to have a competent person provide such professional service to solve a frustrating garage door opening problem. David followed up with electrical enhancements to complete the full repair. Precision is a very professional operation, with good people!</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>There's a very good reason why you see their trucks at advertising everywhere. Great company amazing employees I probably had to deal with three to four different checks so far with the properties that I manage and each time I felt very confident not only in the work that was performed but also what was done to correct issue and no overselling items that ones does not need. Do yourself a huge favor call these guys first before you have another company come out! This is from someone who manages 75 properties in San Diego as you would imagine keeping tenants happy along with the owners of the property such as cost is is not always easy but feel confident with this company when they come out you're only getting what you need  not some spiel on why you need to replace everything.

Could not be happier with the company thank you guys again appreciate it< /Review>< Pictures>

Working with Precision Garage Door of San Diego was an amazingly easy and delightful process.  They responded right away to our inquiry and sent Mark out to see our door.  He was one of the nicest people I've ever met!  Made all the arrangements and told us we'd have our new door the following week.  Right on schedule our new door was installed and it looks great!  Everyone at Precision is kind and helpful.  It is one of the nicest companies we've ever had the pleasure of doing business with!  Don't shop for a garage door anywhere else!</text>

<Review>Called at about 6 pm last night when my door stopped working and immediately got an appointment window booked between 8-10 am this morning.

Jon, the technician, was extremely professional - called with a heads-up on arrival timing, was right on time, provided a clear explanation of everything to be done and had the repairs done and door working again in no time.

Very happy with how Precision stands behind their warranty and takes care of customers so quickly.

Jon also provided me with great tips and clarification on the maintenance I need to do to ensure a long life for my springs.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

The company was prompt and very communicative with an email confirmation and text letting us know our technician was on his way. The email had a picture of our technician too, which was a nice added touch. Josh was great, friendly, honest, hard-working, and took pride in his work. We would definitely recommend Precision Garage Door of San Diego!</Review>

I could not be more happy with my experience with Precision Garage Door of San Diego. On the sales side Mark was punctual, informative, and made sure I chose the door that worked best for me. For the installation Jesse had the door installed in about 2 hrs and was extremely professional. I would recommend Precision Garage to everyone with garage door needs.</text>

<Review>Mark, our technician,  was punctual, polite, and very professional.  He wasn't successful in finding replacement window trim from Wayne Dalton (discontinued item), but was able to remove the trim without it affecting the glass integrity/safety itself. He removed the rest of the window trims.  We found the glass windows to be secure without the trim.  A little Windex on the glass and the door looks like new!  No charge for the service call.  Mark knows his business very well!  It was a pleasure to have him here to help us!  If we ever have any problems with the garage door, we have Precision Garage Doors number handy and will call them first!</Review>< Pictures>

James did an outstanding job giving a total breakdown of the work needed, affordable options, and did so with a smile. We had a great conversation and I could tell he was a genuinely great guy. He then did a great job and finished the work very quickly. 5 stars to the company and the tech. James is a rock star.<//text>

Very responsive and professional! Gabriel did a great job diagnosing the problem, ordering the parts and making the repairs on our 20 year old door. We plan to call him back every two years to make the necessary adjustments so it won’t break when you least expect it!</Text>

James did a great job of explaining everything to me upfront, he inspected the door with me, and went over the various options for fixing, and/or replacing it. He was very professional, and completed the work in a timely manner. The door now works great!

Thank you,

<text>I ordered the door from precision garage several months ago. Due to covid the door took time to arrive . Precision Door kept me updated on progress with regular emails. When I called they were friendly and gave updates on progress. The day the door was to be installed I received email and text reminding me of the appointment. A picture and name was sent to me of the person installing the door . Jesse called and asked if he could come early . He arrived and installed the door in less than 1 hour . Jesse took time to explain how the door worked and gave advice on how to protect it from damage. He cleaned up all evidence of his presence and hauled our old door away . I highly recommend this company and Jesse . I couldn’t have asked for better service . They exceeded expectations.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>The telephone response  yesterday was  very prompt and we were scheduled for this morning. Gabriel from  Precision Garage Door Service came in this  morning on time to service our 3 car garage doors.  Both garage openers were replaced , tracks  replaced, springs serviced , new remote controls etc. His service was exemplary and he went out of his way to address our questions. We plan to use Precision Garage Door in the future and work with Gabriel whenever possible.</Text>< Pics>

But most importantly. Attention to detail. I have been through 3 Homes and 6 Garage doors, never has it been done to the level of perfection. My installs are difficult because of equipment that is installed in my Garage. Gabriel was able to meet every goal I needed to achieve.

Mark came to our house to give us an estimate on a new garage door and
opener.  He was very personable and professional. He explained everything
very precisely.  He answered all our questions.  We are to the installation of

<Text>I am very pleased with Precision of San Diego. I was able to set up an appointment online for the next day. The following morning I received an email telling me what time to expect the technician. I also received a text with a picture of the technician about 30 prior to the scheduled arrival time. The tech arrived on time and was very professional. He gave me 4 different options to fix our issues with our garage door and door opener. I highly recommend this company and their tech Josh Jackson.</Text>< Pictures>

I was able to get a same day appointment and Jonathan called and was able to get there early. The service was quick and we were able to transfer the warranty from the homes previous owners to us and get a battery back up for when the power goes out.  Very happy with the service, product, and company.</Text>

I called on a Sunday, albeit I imagine I was a bit lucky had a tech come out to meet me within 20 minutes! Chasen was very knowledgeable, was able to help troubleshoot why our sensors kept becoming misaligned making us unable to close the garage door, made recommendations and serviced our garage door. I opted to change our rollers, as ours didn’t have bearings and were made from a cheap plastic material. Once they were changed and tuned, the door opened and closed much smoother and quieter! We just purchased the home and hadn’t set up our outdoor garage door code and wasn’t sure how, and without asking Chasen offered and successfully reset everything and connected our remotes and my phone app to my Liftmaster.

He was very pleasant, honest, reliable and easy to work with. I will 100% use their service for my future garage door needs!< /text>

Entire experience was awesome. I highly recommend this company from start to finish. Our carriage house garage style doors were installed today and our home is transformed! Our installer, Rick Jasso, was outstanding. Nice, professional, thorough, really cares. Our estimator, Greg Burnes, was the exact same way. Precision Garage Doors has great people, service, and products. Could not be happier!<//Text>

This is a fantastic company with quality people, great products, and top-notch service. Mark was a wealth of information during the estimate and gave a very reasonable price. The installation team (Jesse and Logan) were very efficient and very organized. My father has been in construction for over 3 decades and he was very impressed with the craftsmanship of thier work. I could not be happier with my new garage doors.< /Text>

Justin Brown was a professional technician who got the job done quick while ensuring the task at hand was compliant with county codes.  Upon arrival, he even took into account our family's needs for spraying his shoes with Lysol and sanitizing his hands before entering our house to get to the garage (Covid-19 Pandemic).  I would highly recommend him for quality service and expertise.<//review>

Had Josh Jackson tech come and do some work on my garage new springs rollers adjusments . Did great job 8-9 months later ,door  was not closing in upper left corner leaving a inch gap at top. Josh fixed that and then inspected everything again and foung cracks in metal panel. Inquired about new garage door Josh gave me some information .Next day called office to have Josh call.  Called set up appointment 7-8 pm he came and took mesurements ,had brochures of doors and windows colors .He spent a lot of time with us going over everything. We are excitingly waiting for our new door to  be deliverd. We know Josh worked all day that but still made the effort to help us. Josh and the company are great. Thank You Chuck and Diane Sutherland< /review>

Jesse Franco is absolutely a wonderful person with a great talent in installing garage doors. From the initial contact with him, he was cordial, friendly, and very professional! He did a tremendous job with our doors! Highly recommend him for any of our neighbors, should they need to replace their garage doors. It was a pleasure having him in our home.<//Review>

I  have previously used Precision before and was satisfied with their work. So today, I call them again to service and help with keypad problem.
Today's technician was Gabriel. Diagnosed the problem.  Knowledgeable friendly guy. I like the fact that he gave me me options to address the issues which was taken care of in a timely manner. 5 stars for Gabriel.<//Review>

Hollis did a great job.  He was on time, installed everything well and it all looked great and worked perfectly.  Hollis then explained how everything worked and answered all of our questions.  We were extremely pleased with the door, opener and the work. Would definitely recommend Hollis and precision door.< /Review>

Had my remote working in 1 minute...then I bought a transfer warranty for my Marantec opener solely on the demeanor/personality of the technician Jon Topping.  Nice guy...trusted him completely with info he provided.

The previous night's phone call for service had the phone tech willing to walk me thru the remote programming...but I opted for the in-person tech.

Stellar service!! Thanks!<//text>

<Text>Our old 16 foot wide steel garage door had been damaged due to multiple events (e.g., car backing into it and falling after a torsion spring broke).  Precision Garage door first sent out Josh, who spent three hours getting it back working in safe manner so that we could order a new door and opener from Precision.  Hollis just completed the new install and opener yesterday and it works great.  Quieter and smoother than it worked before.  Both Josh and Hollis arrived on time, were courteous, and did high quality work.  Thanks!</Text>< date>

Our garage door remote stopped working. After a couple of weeks of hoping it would start working again, we called Precision to replace it. Logan came out and took care of it in a few minutes. He did not even charge for a service call., jus the remote. He was very courteous.< /review>

Had a broken spring called Precision on a friend's recommendation on a Friday afternoon and they came at 8 am the next morning. The tech gave me several options on fixing the problem and maintaining other parts. Ended up getting the full service; during which he showed me how worn-out the old parts were. Very happy that my garage door works again and the assurance that I will work for years to come.</Text>

I’m very happy with Preston’s work. He took the time to explain all the options available involving motor, hardware, and technology. The installation went smoothly and he took the extra time to clean up. A Positive Installation.< /Review>

I'm beyond impressed with Precision! Over the weekend the cables on my garage door came loose and I wasn't able to fix it myself. I called today and they were able to get a tech out same day. Not only that, Anthony called me several hours ahead of schedule to see if he could come sooner to do the fix. He was able to find and address the root problem(s) and get the repair taken care of super quick. Turns out it wasn't just the cables - there was a bunch of issues but Anthony walked me through everything and PHYSICALLY showed me what he was talking about and was never pushy or salesy and I never got the feeling he was trying to rip me off. I fact, when it came time to pay he let me know he didn't actually have to do a portion of the job, saving me money. He could have easily done it or said he did it and charged me. I didn't advise him of this when he was here, but I am a property adjuster for one of the largest insurance companies in the US and have dealt with plenty of contractors and garage door companies so I was confident I had a winner here. It's commonplace for people to ask me for referrals on work and I will absolutely recommend Precision. Thank you again! My garage is better than new!< /text>

Wow!  Wish I could give more stars.  My garage door was acting funky.  It wouldn't go down all the way UNLESS I pushed on the garage transmitter (inside the garage, not the remote) continually until it closed.  This went on for a few weeks before I finally had enough of looking on the internet HOW to fix it myself. No help.  So, I called Precision because I had hired them in 2018 to put on new doors at a different home I owned in Solana Beach.  Called the local number and it actually was a call center for the company.  They had Jon Topping at my house within TWO hours!  Now that's service!  Jon had determined that the sensors might have been going bad (only after 24 years!) since there was nothing interfering with the sensors.  Also, he noticed that my door, when unhinged, was coming down TOO easily.  He explained that the main springs weren't handling the load and could snap in the near future.  So, he replaced BOTH the springs and sensors....which he had on the truck!  Didn't have to order them to "get back to me later".  Also, they have a lifetime warranty. He serviced and lubricated BOTH of my garage doors too.  It took him only 20 minutes!  Jon is one of the reasons this business is successful.  He was very prompt, courteous, funny and professional.  He has very good people skills and IF I have any further issues I would request him in a heartbeat.  Thanks AGAIN Precision Overhead Garage Door Service for your help!<//Review>

<Review>Kris was fantastic, fast, efficient and professional. I am happy he is my neighborhood technician and would absolutely recommend Precision for any garage door needs. I have wasted so much of my own time trying to replace and or reprogram my Keyless entry and he took about 5 seconds to replace, reprogram and reinstall a new one! And it was under warranty! Thank you Kris! Much appreciated!<//Review>< Response>

Dustin arrived promptly and knew his stuff, got our garage door opened when it was stuck/disabled from the inside and we were able to make minor repairs to get it working properly again without having to replace the garage door opener or any other hardware. Awesome job!!<//Review>

I was so very impressed with the work performed by James and Logan of Precision Garage Door Service. They replaced a broken torsion spring and found and fixed another problem that prevented an sure disaster. One always hopes that home maintenance technicians show up on time and perform their work in a professional and friendly way. These gentlemen did just that and did it while observing all the correct safety precautions during this difficult time of the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope that I don't have the need for their work again anytime soon but if I do I will be contacting them. 5-stars are not nearly enough!  Thank You!<//Review>

Excellent customer service provided by Chasen today 03122021. Chasen was knowledgeable about the product he was installing and passionate about providing great quality work and top notch customer service.

My old garage motor was in its last leg, I went w a new garage motor, rollers and hardware for everything needed. I am very happy w the way this new super quiet set up turned out. I am a happy customer and will be coming back precision door service for more.

I can't thank Gabe enough for his help over this past week. He took my call on a Sunday afternoon and stepped away from his family to assist me with re-programming my garage keypad and remotes. During that call, I shared with him the challenges I was facing in trying to fix/replace a window and frame on the garage door. He was very proactive and went above and beyond to help me resolve this matter within one week. This is something I've been trying to repair for almost a year. Gabe is consistent in his communications, transparent, reliable, and shows a high level of integrity in his dealings. I strongly recommend Gabe and his team for any of your garage door needs. Thank you Gabe!<//Text>

I  have previously used Precision at my last home and was very satisfied. So when my garage door broke at my new, home, I called Precision.
My technician Gabriel arrived on time. Diagnosed the problem, gave me my options and completed the repairs on the spot. Thanks Gabriel and Precision.<//Review>

Mark personally made multiple trips to our home to ensure that all measurements were accurate and that contractors working on other aspects of the job were accurate and the door would be installed seamlessly! They were responsive when we called with questions (a huge bonus and very professional). We highly recommend them!!!</Text>

Gabriel was very knowledgeable about what was wrong with my door. In a timely manner the door was repaired and he explained to me what could be done in the future to keep my door running smoothly. I would recommend using precision garage door.</text>

Called frantically because our garage door broke at 10 o clock at night, and they were able to get me an appointment the next day. Josh Jackson was our technician,he was prompt,thorough, professional and super quick! Extremely knowledgeable and made sure we had safe options to chose from. Answered all of our questions and took care of our garage door as if it was his own. Will definitely recommend to others and we will use this company from now on.<//Review>

<review>Bruce did an excellent job replacing the spring for my garage door, and installing a new garage door motor. He was polite, courteous, knowledgable, and professional. Bruce even stayed late to make sure the job was done in one day! I highly recommend Bruce for any garage door repair!! I will certainly call Bruce and Precision in the future for any needs.

Thank you Bruce!< /review>< pictures>

Over charge for everything watch your wallet.Read contract slowly they charge for stuff that comes with garage door opener package.A bracket and 8 foot rail do.Then they add a keyless entry pad not needed but add $90 buckets. They charge for service call even after getting job. NOT HAPPY</review>

<rating>5< /rating><user_name>Erica Molina The Realtor<//user_name><Review>Precision Garage Doors was a wonderful company to work with from start to finish of our new garage door project. Mark, the project manager was friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. We had original garage doors from 1970 that did not function and needed new doors and motor. Mark guided us through all the different products and provided an accurate estimate and project timeline that never changed. On install day, his team which included Jesse and James, arrived on time at 8am ready to get to work. They disassembled our old doors and hauled them away on the truck. Next they installed our new doors and motor in about 3-4 hours time. Let me say that I had four different garage door companies bid for this project and I'm so happy we choose Precision. Great service, great products, great communication, friendly staff, great/fair pricing! I would highly recommend this company for a garage door project.< /Review><GmapID>0x80dbf8b40cbaaab1:0xb395074cea1d68e9< /GmapID></record>

I called Precision Garage Door to make an appointment for a tune up. They were great! They sent someone out to my house the same day. The technician Josh Jackson was fantastic. He was very friendly, knowledgeable and professional. He took the time to answer any questions I had. I will definitely use Precision Garage Door again!!!<//review>

Our garage door was damaged after we accidentally backed our car box into  it (completely forgot it was on the car roof). My husband called Precision and they quickly made an appointment for us with a 2 hour time slot for an inspection and quote. Mark gave me a call 30 minutes prior to arrival and was extremely friendly. Although Precision does not sell the brand of garage door that we own, Mark was quick to point me in the right direction and gave me the specific information I would need in order to order a panel for the door. He said that a new door was probably not the best idea since there's a new law that says garage door motors now need a battery backup. I really appreciate that Mark was looking out for our best interest at the moment and suggesting we replace the panel instead of pushing me to replace the entire door and motor unit. when need to replace our garage door and motor in the future, we will be giving Precision a call. Thanks again, Mark!<//text>

Scott Carlson came to our house to fix our broken garage door. He was excellent!!! He even came early, which freed up my day:)
He quickly diagnosed our problem and did a very quick and clean job of replacing a spring and installing a new garage opener.
He was so nice, and we couldn’t have asked for better customer service!
Thanks so much, Scott! If we ever need anything else, we will definitely be calling your company!</text>

I originally called because I was having problems programing my second garage door opener. When the tech arrived I explained my issue. He told me the motor was burned out and that's why it wouldn't program two. That sounded a little off to me but I had another issue with the weather strip. He repaired it. A week later I open the garage door and the weather strip puuls apart half way across the garage door. He nedds to return to do the repair again. Knowing the motor story didn't sound right I sought out another company. I called Heritage and explained my issue. For 89 buck the tech comes out and spends 5 minutes ( 5 minutes ) and programes the second remote. Stay away from rhis one, unless you want to spemd more money like me.</Text>

James Myer came out to our property in Chula Vista.  His schedule was flexible and worked with our short window of being home for the day.  James came out and found a small issue that we can fix ourselves and didn't try to sell us anything.  Highly recommend this company's service.  Wish more businesses operated like this.  Thank you James for saving us hundreds of dollars.</review>

It was nice to have a technician show up almost two hours early for an appointment. Gabriel assessed the situation, formulated a quote, and got to work immediately. There was no hem-hawing, he got right down to the facts of situation, and then got to work, which I really appreciated. Gabriel epitomized the word professional. I wish all of my services calls went this smoothly.</text>

Shout out to the Precision Door team. Painless from scheduling the initial appointment to installation of our new doors. We are very pleased with the doors Mark designed to work around our older home’s pipes and Jesse did a great job of installing them. Great Team Work! Can’t believe how nice the doors look and how quiet the Openers sound.</text>

Same-day service to replace a broken spring. Gabriel arrived within the given window, presented all cost options up front and was very friendly and customer service oriented. He came in a mask and gloves and was respectful of social distancing mandates.The work was completed within the hour window he estimated and everything works great. I would highly recommend Gabriel and Precision.<//text>

My garage finally gave out last night and I gave Precision Garage Door Service a call in the morning. They were able to fit me in their schedule that SAME day! Josh Jackson provided great customer service! He was friendly and worked quickly and efficiently. He gave me a few different options to solve my problem, and explained exactly what was being installed and fixed. I’m very excited about my new door, it’s SO quiet and was reasonably priced. They even installed and synced a keypad for me. The whole job was done in about an hour! Thanks Josh! I will definitely be using their services in the future and would highly recommend them!

If you’re looking for professional, quick, and great service, give these guys a call!<//review>

<review>This company is awesome! From the scheduler Taylor setting up the appointment on the same day. Mark Davidson the field manager came out and provided better understanding of what was wrong with our garage. His customer service was wonderful and knew what he was talking about. He is definitely an expert. Also took the time to explain to my mother whos english is her second language what is going on. Mark was able to schedule one of his techs Joshua Jackson the same day to come out to replace our motor. They were professional and friendly. Did the job well! This company is true to their word. I was very impressed with the one day install! Thank you for the overall amazing experience.< /review><user_id>109313903793863819454< /user_id>< Pics>

Big thank you to Precision garage door. My garage door got stuck today and was totally destroyed. I thought I was going to be out of luck until Monday, being that it is the weekend.  Nope! Precision was at my house in hours on a Saturday. Fixed my door that I thought would have to be replaced and gave me a price that was way less than I expected. The repairman was nice, friendly and professional. Thank you so much! Honest businesses are hard to come by. If you are reading this unsure of whether to hire there guys, YES the answer is YES.< /review>

I received six different quotes, the one that stood out above the rest was Precision Garage Door Service. I went with Precision Garage because not only was the price very competitive to the other companies. The customer service was the best. The two workers who came out to install my doors were on time, very professional. The best thing about Precision though was the customer service that I received from Larry the manager. You can’t go wrong as long as Larry is managing Precision Garage Door Service of San Diego.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1572977978021, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words, we strive to do our best.'}< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Very friendly personality, interacted well with my doggies and explained everything in simplistic terms (for a single female like me to understand). He went over the pricing before doing anything and made sure I approved before moving forward with any repairs. Extremely professional person but had a good natured, friendly side too. He even gave me some treats for my Puppies!!

I recommend this company and if you can ask for James to be your technician do so!!!< /review>< Pictures>

I appreciate a company which prides itself on great service. My experience with Precision was excellent. I called to get my garage door looked at which was really busted up. Travis was the technician who arrived and walked me through all the options. He got me further information on new doors and a repair estimate. One I confirmed the work we wanted to get done, he was at the house 2 days later. Travis was always on time, friendly and clear with what was needed. His work was quality and at a fair price. The door is fixed!< /Text>

I paid for a lifetime warranty 10 years ago for a garage door opener and when it got fried by a power outage, they came out quickly and replaced the opener on the warranty.  They are fast and efficient and honor their commitments.< /review>

Thank you! Chris our sales person was on time, provided great information and on the spot cost estimate. He made a couple of good suggestions that I had not thought about, and the estimate appears to be  very reasonable for the replacement of our cracked garage door. Very pleasant , and great customer service. I look forward to having the doors installed  within the next couple of weeks.

Only thing I would like to see is a payment option on line. I always have to wait for the tech to perform the service and then give them a cc over the phone.

<Text>Larry's initial visit was prompt and useful. Great guy, good job so far. He quickly sent a quote. After which I called him to define the specifics that I needed and reminded him of the $100 discount that he promised if I move the electric outlet to a convenient location. This had been done. He responded by promising a follow up quote. Then three calls to Larry, one text, one call to manager with no responses and five days later. No follow up quote ever was sent. I have no idea what happened. These guys were quick and fine at the start and then failed miserably for reasons I could not grasp. Beware.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Excellent service and work!  The technician Chris called to let me know he was on his way, which I really appreciate. Once he arrived, he explained what my garage door needed and completed the work quickly. He’s very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable.  I would highly recommend Precision Garage Door and Chris.<//Text>

<Review>Jon and his co-worker (I'm sorry, I'm terrible with names) were very professional and clearly care a lot about the work. My garage door wasn't in good shape, but they got it working again very quickly. Most of the time, people just say something is broken or worn out and that it needs to be replaced. With Jon, he articulated exactly why a part needed to be replaced or repaired and specifically pointed to the issues so I could see it for myself. The door sounds amazing, in that it doesn't sound like much at all. As a noise control engineer, I can definitely appreciate that. I feel very confident in his work and would definitely recommend Precision (and especially Jon) to anyone that needs their garage door repaired or replaced.< /Review><rate>5<//rate><Resp>{'time': 1572978443570, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words, we strive to do our best.

We called precision the day that we needed someone to come out and assess our problem and they sent Travis out within 1.5 hours. He was knowledgeable, honest, friendly and beyond professional! He got the job done at a reasonable price while giving us all our options! We left super happy customers and will call them again with any garage door needs! Thanks again!< /Review>

He not only honored the promotion which I was offered when I made the appointment, also upgraded the torsin spring which replaced the broken one I had. After fixing, the door is smooth and much quieter than before.  Over all, it is great experience and Strong recommend Travis and precision to everyone!< /review>< Pictures>

The Mark Davidson very professional/ expert, have cleaned the safety eyes, realigned them and educated the tenant that the garbage cans next to the safety eyes may have knocked them out of alignment.
He also educated us on how to properly care for the door and maintain it to get optimal results and safety,
We would highly recommend using this service and specifically ask Mark.

<Review>Extremely professional and personable.  Their staff all the way from the person, Erin, who took my original trouble call all the way down to the three technicians that personally dealt with my problem..  The very best service/trouble call I have ever had.  I can't recommend their entire team more highly.  Fast and efficient all the way including sweeping up any debris resulting from my fix.  They made sure it was right before they left.  WOW--WithOut Worries.  They evaluated my situation.  Gave me a full explanation of what was needed to make sure my garage door was woking just like it did over 50 years ago when everything was new.
Great team, great serviced personable and professional to boot.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>We had experiencing intermittent problems with our 21 year old garage door opener. So I had heard some good recommendations about Precision. We had them come out to look at it. Eric called and said he was running early and was close. So he made an assessment and I'm glad he did. We replaced the springs and opener which made quite the difference. We recommend Precision.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1552674416754, 'text': 'We love to hear from our customers, thank you for taking the time to share your experience!'}<//response>< gmapID>

I called in to have someone come out to troubleshoot my garage door opener and the customer service rep was extremely friendly and told me to expect someone between 2 and 4 that same day. I received a call right at 2 letting me know they would be at my house at 2:20. Larry Emory showed up right at the expected time and checked out the opener. He was very professional and friendly and thorough with explaining my options. He installed a new opener and did it in a very timely manner. Larry was a great representative of the company and I will be recommending him to my neighbors. Job well done!<//text>

I waned to take a moment to share my experience with Precision. I made an appointment with my new friend , Mark  Davidson. He was right on time and very throw in his evaluating the Job. His quote was done on the spot and very competitive. This was a Morning and I had another one that afternoon . As it turned out the other appointment show up late and left saying he would sent the quote by email. Mark was so good and very friendly that I decided to go ahead. I gave Mark a call and he had the job scheduled for the next week. Milt , the installer, called about an hour or 2 early to confirm His start time. I was ready early so he showed up right away. His assistant came and the job was completed in under 3 hours including a good clean up. I highly recommend these people and Precision Door.< /Review>

Ben from Precision did a thorough job of checking out my garage door to make sure it was working safely and properly.  He determined that my problem was the remote opener.  Since I already had to pay the insurance company a $75 deductible (even though the remote was not covered), Ben gave me a new remote!  I'll always be a Precision Garage Door Service customer!<//Text>

Rather than letting her know that it just needed to be replaced they sold her a $600+ repair job. Not cool.< /review></record>

Precision did a great job. They checked with us for any changes, sent their workman by himself and he was able to change the old door out for the new one in just a few hours. He was very polite and let us know all throughout the process what he was doing. We are thrilled with the new garage door, our old one was over 50 years old and was in need of a proper burial when it was put to rest. .

<Text>Larry took a bad experience and made it a great one. We had been struggling with our garage door not opening and closing because the shootings were too old. The door repair tech that we dealt with before was only interested in charging us for a while new assembly. When Larry came he offered to just fix the motor and the springs which was nice on my wallet. We now have a garage site that works great! Thanks Larry!</Text><rate>5< /rate>< Date>

I called in the morning and received a technician by 12:00 noon.  We ended up getting a new garage door opener and the price was reasonable.  Our technician Chris Baucom was awesome.  Since it was a newer model, he took the time to make sure we knew all the functions of the remote.  We will definitely use again.</Review>

<review>They have a service line that was open on Sunday morning when I called. They were able to arrange same day service for our suddenly non-functional garage door. The service person arrived on-time and was finished in less than 2 hours (spring replacement). The door was fixed and several minor incidentals were also fixed, which was a nice bonus.< /review><username>Tyson Jensen<//username>< Rate>

Travis showed up before our appointment. Professional, friendly and explain all the options. He asked what our price point was and didn’t try sell us in more expensive option. He gave recommendations to what’s being sold in the market according to the home esthetics. Great job Travis!<//Review>

< Review>
I needed a garage door spring replaced and called Precision because they were familiar with my original instillation and because they provided next day service.  As it turned out they offered me 3 repair and/or service options.  I picked the one that was the best for my situation.  Ben, the Certified Technician was very knowledgeable and had the years of experience required to do a professional repair in a relative short period of time.  I will probably use Percision again for my garage door needs.<//Review>

Larry is awesome! He was flexible, professional and efficient. Saved the day for me! He was able to come out and fix my garage door the same day. He could tell he knew what he was doing! He quickly assessed the problem, gave me my options and had my door fixed in to no time. I'd highly recommend him if you're looking for someone who's knowledgeable, professional and friendly.<//review>

Got a little flack on the phone for showing up late because I was unsure of the eta and I did not get an exact time, but that was mostly my fault because I agreed to the general timeframe. For everyone reading this, they are extremely punctual, so if they say they will be there from 2pm-4pm, you should caution on the side of 2pm. Besides that little hiccup, the service was spectacular. Scott, I believe that was his name, was very knowledgeable and worked his magic like a spine surgeon. Thanks!< /text>

I called Chris about problems with my garage door opener 3 days ago and he accommodated me with a Saturday appointment. He examined the “patient” and found the problem. He provided me with options and discussed the decision with me. I decided to go for a while new system and he got back in record time, installed it cleanly and efficiently, and demonstrated how all the features worked. He then programmed my car’s opener. I found Chris to be friendly and knowledgeable and would recommend Precision to others in need of a tune up, repair, or replacement*</Text>

My new Precision Garage Door is really nice! A huge improvement over the previous dark-painted wood door. Mark Davidson, the sales rep, was very helpful providing information for me to make a choice that worked for me financially and aesthetically. Jesse, the installer, worked quickly and efficiently and did a very good job with the installation. All in all, I'm very pleased with both the service and the product.<//text>

Mark texted me when he was on his way (which I appreciated) and was right on time. Mark was friendly, very knowledgeable and had a lot of samples to show us. Pricing was very competitive, so ended up ordering a garage door while he was there. Mark contacted me a couple of weeks later to let me know the garage door was ready, so we scheduled a date for installation. I then had to cancel the appointment as the construction on the house was not complete and garage was being used as storage. Mark was very accommodating and held onto the garage door. Finally scheduled installation and Season Rusk, the installer called me on his way to the house. Again, they were right on time and installation went very smoothly. They even cut a piece of the door, so I could match the color for the front doors.

Our experience  with Precision Door was fantastic from beginning to end! We'll definally use them again on our next home!</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dbf8b40cbaaab1:0xb395074cea1d68e9</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Larry from Precision GD came out to assess/service our 4-year old wooden sectional garage door that we had installed with another company and not only did he repair a broken bracket but spotted other issues, provided sound guidance and executed well on the repair and install of a new motor.  His customer service was great/friendly and he has solid knowledge/expertise.  We are very pleased with the experience and result.<//Review>

He listened intently to our needs, did not try to upsell us, got us scheduled promptly, and made excellent use of our resources. They probably aren't the cheapest date in town, but they make up for it in their highest level of service and performance. The installer was early, finished quickly, left the area cleaner than it was, and made sure that we understood how everything worked in addition to being friendly and caring. I would heartily recommend Mark and his team! We love our new handsome door and super quiet opener!<//review>< Response>

<Review>Called Precision Garage Door in the morning and was able to schedule an appointment for the same afternoon. Erick Parks called me about 30 mins after my initial call and said he could be there earlier. So within 2 hours, my technician arrived. Erick was quick and efficient. Did not feel pressured at all. Once we decided that we needed a new motor, it was installed, tested and operating in about an hour. Really impressed with quality of motor installed. It is a Marantec 370. Not the cheapest available but operates very smoothly and quietly. Very impressed with the lifetime warranty on labor and parts. They must really believe in their products and installers. Thanks for the great service from Erick Parks!</Review><user_id>111794962369962510130</user_id><pictures>None<//pictures><date>1513110135493<//date>< Response>

<Review>Precision Door serviced my home about a year ago. Larry Emory called me randomly yesterday and asked how my door was working because he was in my area and remembered me cause I had intereference issues. I have never had a service company of any sort do this. He made my wife and I so happy with the decision in choosing this company we will gladly recommend Larry and Precision to others.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Top notch service.  We scheduled a routine check/lubrication for a Precision device that had been installed 13 years ago.  The service man, Erick, was on time, friendly, efficient, and not pushy about added services.  We would certainly use him again and certainly recommend him and the company<//review>

<Text>Larry Emory was the technician that came to my house. I was amazed at the quality of service he was able to provide, both craftsmanship and speediness, he was very respectful to the fact that I was in a rush to leave and needed to have my garage door working A.S.A.P. I will gladly recommend  Precision Garage Door of San Diego to any and everyone that I come across that may need to have any garage door work done. 5 stars well earned! I would have given 10 if it were possible!</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I normally don't write reviews however, I felt I needed to give credit where credit is due. After dealing with six bad experiences (technicians not returning calls or not showing up for appt.) I found Precision Garage Doors (thanks to ValuePack) and called them. Lady who answered the call was professional but James was not only professional but also friendly and helpful. He was on time for the appt. even though it was pouring outside. Thank you James!
Now, waiting for the door to arrive and be install.<//Review>< pics>

Have been a long time customer and today's service call reinforced our experience over the years that this is one of best service companies in town. A technician, Kenny, arrived within an hour of our call for service, identified the problem, fixed it, offered and provided basic maintenance, and was gone in no time. Thanks Kenny - nothing like a great service experience.< /text>

Chris was soooo awesome! It’s the last Saturday before Christmas. I had an early morning Appointment then final Christmas shopping. I had sooo much to do. There was no time for a non functioning garage door!  My garage door opener stopped working late Friday night. My car was in the detached garage and no way for me to get to it. I shared my concerns with the CSR Friday night and asked if  she could put this on the work order. She said she would and suggested to be safe to call at 8 am the next morning. I didn’t need to call! At 7:45 I get a call from Chris that he is on His way!! He has the door fixed and working in no time at all! He saved my day!! Thank you Chris and Team for making me and my time feel valued!! I will recommend your company from here on in!! EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Thank you!!!

< Review>
They came to check out my garage door at no cost (the remotes werent working)
They said I had to install a external receiver for $400.
Or replace the whole mechanism for over $800.
Contacted a second garage door company, they came out to try out a external receiver and didnt work so they offer to either replace the garage door logic board for under $100 or the whole mechanism for $400
In summary: this guys are more than twice as expensive as other companies and wont really look into the problem, just try to sell you stuff without even checking first if thatd fix the problem.<//Review>

<user_name>Vannete wirant</user_name><Review>We just had our garage door opener (a 25 year old GENIE) replaced by Precision Door Service San Diego today. Larry Emory was our technician and he had a trainee with him. They were prompt (on the front side of the window they gave). How often does that happen. The installation was done very professionally. The opener they installed is a Marantec M55. It is very quiet and well built. We are extremely happy with our new garage door opener and feel fortunate we found Precsion Door Service.</Review>< rate>

<Review>I had a new garage door installed on Jan 19th.  I noticed later that one window was not properly aligned and emailed my sales rep Mark who promptly sent a service request.  Your technician Nic Rummel did a great job of straightening the one window in my new garage door that wasn't correctly aligned.  My new Precision Garage Door looks FANTASTIC!
Thank You for the fast and efficient same day service!  Love my new garage door, it's so smooth and quiet.  I'm very satisfied!</Review><user_id>102842370848276070540<//user_id><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

<review>Nic Rummel was the Technician that performed replacement of two torsion springs and center support bearing.  He showed me low vs high cost repair with all prices displayed on his tablet.  He invited me to watch the entire operation.  Additionally, he came 2 hours early, with my permission (how many times do you hear of early show-ups?).  Nic performed a full operational inspection and lubed all moving rollers, hinges and springs.  He even left me an aerosol can of silicone spray.  Outstanding service!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Text>Kenny Aronson was awesome!  He fixed a problem with my roll up, solid wood door that no other tech could fix for 10 years.  I have a heavy wood door that kept going out of alignment due to shifting on the tracks.  Kenny was able to see the problem in 5 minutes and came back the next day with the fix.  He saw that some metal shims were needed on the roller so that the door would remain in place.  It has been over 6 weeks and so far the door operates great.  Thank you Kenny!</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Previously called another company that said Marantec garage door motors are horrible, they don't work on them, they can replace it with Liftmaster, blah, blah, blah . I decided to get a second opinion and call Precision Doors to see how much they would charge to replace. Ben came out on Sunday and started immediately diagnosing the problem. Within an hour, my garage door was working. Charged a reasonable amount and significantly cheaper than replacement. These are the guys to call if you have an issue. Professional, reputable and honest. Couldn't be happier and will only call them next time something happens. Thanks Ben and thanks Precision doors!</Review>

< Review>
Larry Emory came out to my house and installed an opener.If we could give him more than 5 stars we would. Its so quiet i didnt even know it was possible. He wasnt pushy at all and ended up installing springs after the motor was done for preventative maintenance. We are very pleased with chosing Precision Door and having Larry service our home.  Great Job!</Review>

The technician came out today and immediately told me I had 2 huge problems with garage door. The first one was the spring was broken and asked for $699.00 then told me that my actual door opener was old and needed replacement. At that price I asked him to leave and called another company that replaced a spring for $199.99. Nothing wrong with my old system.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1499881296491, 'text': "Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us!

Our condominium complex just had an old wooden garage door replaced by Precision Garage Doors.  Mark Davidson, Field Manager for Precision, was readily available to show the product, answer questions and provide an open line of communication throughout the ordering and installation process.  With his help, we decided on an almond colored Stratford steel door with long panels and a clear window section.
Precision’s products were of the highest quality, their selection was good, and their prices were very reasonable. The ordering process was simple and the door was ready for installation in just a few weeks. When it was, Precision worked around our schedule and residents were given plenty of advanced notice to plan their car usage around the installation time.  On the day of installation, Stason Rusk, the Certified Technician, contacted me with his arrival time. He showed up as scheduled and quickly got to work removing the heavy old garage door and replacing it with the lighter steel one.  He worked steadily and finished ahead of the amount of time residents had allocated for the installation. It was obvious that Stason was a specialist at what he did.  He displayed an amazing attention to detail and was not satisfied until every adjustment had been made, every hinge had been sprayed and every fingerprint had been removed. Before he left, he took the time to instruct me on ongoing maintenance that was recommended to extend the life of the door and assure that it works at its highest capacity. I have been very impressed with the outstanding customer service, quality products and the professionalism and specialized abilities of the technicians associated with Precision Garage Doors.  I would highly recommend this company, their product and their employees to anyone looking for this type of service.< /text>

It has been a while since the work was done and now the door is making
some clanking noise as it closes.  It did not do that before.< /review>

I was appalled by the woman at the front/help desk. Anyone that rude and snappy should not be the first person that people come in contact with. She was so uninterested in helping that should told me they don't do a certain type of hearing. The information board directly behind her said that is one of the services, not just once but in three different places. She wouldn't even listen to what I was trying to tell her. She just kept talking over me and being extremely rude. Finally her supervisor came and helped a little bit. But the issue still didn't move any closer to a solution.< /Review>

Danny L. Haukedalen, Commissioner is an unfair Commissioner for woman. After 7 years of him presiding over my divorce another female lawyer told me she has had no luck with Danny L. Haukedalen, Commissioner supporting any of her female clients!! Wow!
Very scary to have a rogue Commissioner. Some background.
I had to represent myself because I was a stay-at-home mom of a 6 year old in Kindergarten, my ex maxed my credit cards, closed my access to our bank accounts, stopped paying the mortgage and didnt pay the IRS for 2 years before he left. And yet made hundreds of thousands of dollars.
After he left I got nothing no spousal or child support. I got on food stamps and cash aid for 3 months to live. They got me legal representation and we had to battle multiple times in court for anywhere close to the right amount of child support.
Danny L. Haukedalen, Commissioner needs to stick to law, stop being sexist, guide better those without legal representation and care for woman as the law requires you to do. There is no such thing as 50 50 in his courtroom total lie. This Commissioner absolutely sucks for all woman. Beware! Great for men.< /text>

<Text>I know that sometimes there are not sufficient clerks, but overall, people are very helpful, I’ve gotten lost in the complex, people have helped. I think the parking is generous, and the space around is very well kept.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Seriously?! 4 windows open, packed room and 3 of the windows are not serving anyone. What a slow bunch of clerks. Something need to be done about this. I understand there is work to do, but this is ridiculous. They are seriously just chilling. I'll be here all day waiting to file 2 pages. Bring me lunch if you stop by.< /Review>< Pics>

Friendly staff, but went with my 11 year old son and a young male guard at the front kept making inappropriate  "69" jokes to my son.
I officially hate this courthouse due to only negative experiences by judges and guards. Im not a criminal.</Review>

<review>Got a flat tire on my Tesla Model 3 on Nov 1, 2020 and had to have it towed to a tire shop. I called to make sure they had my tire size. Once I conformed they had my tire I had my car towed to this location.

When I arrived. They said they would not work on a Tesla.  I told them I didn't not have standard Tesla wheels or tires and they still refused to work on it. Then they stated there's too much liability to lift the Tesla.

I asked if I was able to use my own jack to remove my wheel if they could just replace my tire and they refused.

I would not trust any shop who is not confident enough or prepared to simply lift a car and replace a tire regardless of model.<//review><resp>None</resp>< time>

<text>Pressured into trying for a credit card, was told would receieve 10% off for trying, looked at invoice at end and realized 10% not applied. Now an inquiry on my credit score for the next year or two until it comes off.  Purchased what I was told was 4 rebate qualifying tires.  After attempting to submit claim find out those tires are not under the rebate.  On top of all of that... My tire went flat day after purchase.  Come to find out there was a ball or something of some sort of material causing a leak near the valve stem.  Come on!!  Won't be back.</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I brought my 2007 BMW 328i in for a simple oil change, assuming the Firestone professionals would be able to handle something as simple and routine as this. However, within minutes of driving my car the next day, my oil light popped on; thinking this was some sort of malfunction (as Firestone changed my oil just the day prior), I attempted to complete my drive down to LA.

However, still 30 minutes from my destination, I noticed smoke billowing out of the hood of the car. I pulled over, lifting my hood only to find oil splattered EVERYWHERE. After a tow truck brought my car to a nearby BMW dealership, the professionals there were quick to point out that whoever changed my oil did not replace the cap properly, and damages to my engine would cost nearly $2,000 to fix.

I reached out out to Firestone to rectify the problem and pay for these repairs, due 100% to their faulty oil change. I was told they would not pay for these repairs, but I should instead bring by car back to Firestone so they can fix it themselves. Considering I can't even trust Firestone with a routine oil change, I have no faith in them replacing all the necessary parts in my engine, and will be suing for damages done to my car.

Words of warning to all Santa Barbara residents: do NOT bring your car for ANY kind of service here at Firestone. Their negligence is not only dangerous, but expect your car to return with more damages done than when you left it (not to mention the lack of integrity and not paying for the damages they themselves caused on the car).< /Review>

I came to this location because I needed to replace the tires on my '05 Mustang GT. Had 4 new Bridgestone Potenza RE970AS Pole Position tires put on, an oil change and an alignment done, about $1200 all told. The front tires were put on yesterday and the rear tires this morning (supply issue). This evening I was nearing the end of a 4-hr drive to San Jose going about 70mph on the 101-N, and one of my brand new front tires blew out and came off of its rim! I almost completely lost steering capability, nearly crashed into cars in both lanes beside me, and then I was fish tailing the whole time I was braking on the shoulder. I cannot recommend trusting the safety of yourself or your family in this place.< /review>

< review>
This is my regular maintenance shop for our Volvo SUV for the last four years. I Left a review a year ago that I loved this place - sorry all - that was a complete mistake!!! I went in two months ago to get a new set of tires (their bread and butter product) and it’s been a nightmare ride ever since. The day after we bought the tires we went out in the morning and one of them was completely flat. Took it back and they got it replaced but we still have a tire two months later that has a slow leak they can’t find or fix. Worse, just a month after they replace the tires we started hearing a clunking noise in the back as we drove and had to take the car into a local shop a day before a road trip (it was the only place open). That shop found that Firestone had left a key bolt off the car (see pictures below, the bolt was completely missing from the one and I’d been driving that way for a month). We for that replaced. But just today I took the car into get the tires balanced and rotated at a firestone in Illinois and they found out that my rotors need replacing because this Santa Barbara firestone did a poor job. I’ve been a firestone customer for 20 years across five shops and never had a terrible experience like this one. This seems specific to this shop in SB but it’s bad enough that I probably will have to stop being a customer overall. If you’re in the Santa Barbara area please at least avoid this place at all costs. Try SwedeMasters instead in downtown Santa Barbara.< /review>

<rate>1</rate><review>I had a 10am appointment for an oil change. I arrived at 945am. No customers were in the building. It took 35 minutes to check me in. Then I was told it would be an hour and a half for an oil change. I came back an hour an a half later and my vehicle had yet to be moved at all. There was still no customers in the building. I got to watch the staff make personal phone calls and joke around while I just sat there. Periodically a customer would show up and be told there vehicle is not ready. Every customer explained how upset they were and left. Save yourself and never use this place. I used to come here years ago and it was always great. Those times are long gone. I will also be writing to Firestone Corp about this experience. I scheduled this a week in advance to fit in my schedule. That schedule is now out the window. Beyond frustrating!<//review>< Pictures>

Where to begin... I came to get an alignment check and I found out I needed two new tires. Definitely wasn’t expecting that. Elan helped me from the very start and provided superb customer service. I really appreciated his transparency, his attention to detail (technicians too), and excellent customer service. He was also pretty funny and very easy to talk to. I highly recommend coming here. It’s a bit out of the way for me - but I’ll definitely be coming back for future service needs.< /text>

<review>Honestly, I have never had such a great experience with auto care shops until now! I went in for an oil change, tire rotation, and general check up for a long trip. The man who attended me was super friendly and helpful, and they were super fast in getting my car ready. It's convenient that there are shopping stores around the area as well.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80e91525461e833f:0x5ab6ad7a2c840280<//Gmap_id><resp>None< /resp><Date>1438931426487</Date>< username>

It had to happen sooner or later, the Fusion had a tire with a slow leak. We're over one hundred miles from home and she needed a fix. Firestone was open, as they have been since 1926, and fixed the tire. Service price is inexpensive and the Service Advisor is knowledgeable. The customer waiting "lounge" is rudimentary. Free parking. Everything is wheelchair accessible including the neutral gender bathroom.</Review>

We got into a pickle on a holiday weekend with a flat tire and Elan was extremely helpful and courteous.  When he said he'd get us back on our road trip in the early afternoon,  we were shocked to be up and running at 11:30am!  Great service and very affordable!</Review>

I asked for a brake inspection and was first told the mechanic couldn't inspect my back brakes because a "thread was stripped."  They asked me to make a second appointment so a "special technician" could fix this.  In the second appointment, they told me that my car's back brake system "was different than other cars" and that I needed a $858 brake job.  I went to a second auto repair outlet that day and the mechanic said my back brakes were fine and that they were not unusual at all.< /Review>

< Review>
I scheduled an oil change because they seemed to be the only ones with a coupon in town. Very easy to schedule. I will say that the guys were very friendly. However, they found 2 nails in my tire. They said that I would have to buy new tires, costing me 1,000. (I just got these tires 3 months ago) I went to America's Tire and they were able to patch the tire with no problem AND for free. Therefore, I won't be going back to Firesstone. Terrible that they take advantage of a young female.</Review>

Recently I had my oil change with another auto-center and they informed me that the rear wheel was out of alignment.  I purchased a lifetime alignment from Firestone last April of 2014 so of course I brought the car to them to get the alignment done.  Here is were it gets interesting.  They did the alignment and when I returned to pick the car up they informed me that the car need $2,843.79 dollars worth of repairs.  Included in this quote was the replacement of radiator hoses for $353.48.  A few years back Firestone replace my radiator and temp sensor.  I was surprised that they were trying to sell me a hose replacement after I already spent $1,100 on prior radiator repairs.  We do not drive this car much, it is 10 years old with 90K miles.  That week it was driven to Thousand Oaks and when my husband returned he said that it was pulling to the right and there was a sound that wasn't there before the alignment.  He felt the car drove better before the alignment was done.  A week later I returned to Firestone requesting that they perform another alignment.
When I returned to pick up the car they told me that it need additional repair costing $639.78.  Elan, the service advisor asked me if I had the other repairs done yet, and I told them I found it interesting that the place were I had the oil service done didn't mention any of the items on their "repair list". At that point Elan went to my car and came back with grease on his finger. Left me wondering how much damage they caused my car to drum up business.  Again, my husband drove the car to Thousand Oaks and the car continued to drive with the pull to the passenger side and an intermittent knock from the wheel located on the drivers side.  Concerned, I brought the car to a reputable independent repair shop service who specialized in my car's make.   There only recommendation was the 90K service that was due and replacing the brakes.  Everything else looked okay and they really check the car over.  To conclude, the car still needs an alignment, but it runs much better.
Take from this what you will, I will never return to Firestone not even to take advantage of my so called life time alignment.<//text>

They called me letting me know a tire had a nail, my car system didn't register any air loss so I was going to take it else where to get it patched. I told them to let it be. When I returned they had pulled out the nail after I asked them not to and left me with a flat tire one hour before I had to go to work! I had no choice but to buy their over priced tire.

Have had brake service on several of my late-model vehicles over the years (2015, 2017 Altima, 2014 Escape, 2007 Prius) and they have been able to complete brake service in an an afternoon, without appointments.  Always diligent about calling when the cars are ready.  If something isn't right they make it right without a hassle.  Been going for years and recommend.<//Text>

I also wanted an inspection since I needed to see if the car was as described. The car passed everything with flying colors and the inspection cost $89. I went ahead and registered it, paid taxes, etc. Since the wobble hadn't been addressed I took the car then to a mechanic thinking it must be something minor. Turns out it has two suspension problems, one costing $1,200 and the engine has a major leak. Firestone was gracious enough to reimburse the $89 but now I have a car that best estimates is going to cost me $4,500 to repair. Thanks Firestone!< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>Just got off the phone with these guys. Terrible! I called because I'm shopping for new tires. First off, the call quality wasn't that great and I mentioned that to him.
I asked if he could look up tires for me and he said they only carry firestone and bridgstone but he can look up the ones I wanted. I asked him what information he needed from me and then he said something but I couldn't make it out. Then click! he hung up on me.
I had a great experience at the firestone in Ventura. Advice for this location, if you keep hiring guys like this you will lose loyal customers which in turn will effect overall sales.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>I was in need of a plug for a tire on my car which had a screw in it. My tires are Michelin which are costly, approximately $350.00 per tire. The manager, Elam Dominquez told me that the tire could not be repaired. I called a friend of mine who is very familiar with tires. He told me to call American tires which I did. American tires ordered me a tire and told me that I would not have to pay for the tire unless I needed it. I had the tire pluged at no cost and I did not need a new tire. It is sad that their are dishonest people who are ready to take advantage of people! Shame on you Elam Domimguez, you shoud not be a manager, you should get FIRED! I forgot to mention that American Tires has better prices on their tires; they are very competive. Excellent service and Good Prices on Tires! The prices on tires at American Tires is better than Firestone!< /text>< pictures>

<user_name>Michelle Widner</user_name>< Review>
The managers and showroom staff were all helpfull & courteous.I called 10 other tire stores for price quotes and theirs was the lowest even their oil change prices were the lowest!
When I went into the store, they stuck to the quote I had been given and promised to have both the oil change and tire mounting done within 1 hour, and they were! You could'nt ask for better service and the place was clean  well organized.
They have a nice waiting area and there is a Mc Donalds right across the parking lot! I've never had a better experience with an Auto/tire place.I highly recommend them!< /Review>

Never go there for anything!!! Ask for just checking the breaks. After I got the car started really bad noise in the back. I came back and I was told I need back breakes to be done. Wanted me to pay $450 for something they did wrong !!!!</Text>

<text>Simply my favorite place to get pizza. Was very happy to hear a location was within walking distance of the Four Point by Sheraton. Highly recommend the Gourmet Chicken Garlic, been getting this pizza for over 25 years!</text>< Pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Gentleman over the phone was extremely rude.
He was overly aggressive and when he found my address was out of his delivery area he told me that he couldnt deliver to my address and hung up on me.

What a bad experience. he could have been polite about it. not sure why they allow this gentleman to answer the phones...

I buy pizzas on the regular for my staff at work..too bad i wont be ordering from them...ever.</review>< pics>

< Review>
The quality of service of this Round Table Pizza joint has gone down drastically.. The food is still great but customer service is suffering greatly… Every-t  I call for a delivery they either can’t do it because they don’t have any drivers (which is understandable of course), or for example the other day I tried to call to place an order for delivery and now they’re telling me that they no longer deliver to our area and I asked him howl ong  ago has this been going on and the man replied for a long time now but just a couple of weeks earlier  I had ordered pizza from them and they were able to deliver and he replied back saying that the no longer deliver to our area.. I asked  if there were any other round tables close to our vicinity that could deliver and he said no none, none of them deliver in your area anymore which is pretty inconvenient because with this Covid in place I prefer to have them deliver then to go pick it up but it seems like the customer is no longer the priority and I understand that they want to also protect their workers but I think it’s unfair that the customer should have to suffer the backlash… Uber eats and door dash are just way too expensive for delivery..anyways that’s  just my thoughts… So now my family and I go to Mountain Mike’s for our pizza now.. Good Bye Round Table you just lost a long time customer..< /Review>

The internationally renown roundtable pizza lives up to its name at this establishment. The toppings go right to the edge. Half a small pizza is a sufficient portion for one person. I wouldn't bring a date here though, only go if you're alone.. wouldn't want someone to see me there that I knew.< /Review>

It's really hard to find good quality pizza but that is not the case here. The gentleman that rang us up was really nice too! I love the atmosphere and that you can watch the football game while you eat your pizza. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the Beers here sucked! I was really sad lol . I wanted a cold beer before my food purchased one and it was flat. Tried a few of the other ones and they were all flat and nasty. Perhaps it was a sign not to drink lol. A cold coke and pizza fixed that issue.</Review>

I have been a regular customer of this Round Table Puzza Shop on Hopyard Rd in Pleasanton since 1997 and what surprises me is how can they maintain best quality years over years... it's really a Most Honest Pizza around.< /Text>

I have been getting pizza from Pizza Guys and Mountain Mikes as it is very close to me for almost 6 years.

They can get busy in the evenings, so book online and have some patience and you will have good tasting pizza. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow for lunch or dinner.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I was very displeased with Round Table at Fallon Gateway they sent an add to out house with coupons on it , so when I went to order the wings it said that they don't deliver to this part of Dublin they should not be giving out flyers in the mail if they won't even deliver over here!!!<//text>

This review is for the food only. No reviews for service as this was take out.
I used to really love this place. When it first opened it had some of the best Asian food I had had in a while. Their imperial pork fried rice was amazing and their chow mein was different and just very flavorful. I'm not sure what has happened, but over the years the food standards have declined greatly. I ordered takeout a couple days ago and the amount of salt on EVERYTHING was just too much to handle. The intricate flavors were lost and instead replaced with salt. It's unfortunate and I probably won't be returning for a very long time. I want to give this place another chance, but it will be difficult. Please bring back the old recipes and cooking styles as the rice was the best I have ever had.< /text>

Asked for chopsticks he acknowledged our request and left to never return. Asked for the other half of our meal and he just stormed off never to return.
Food ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I loved my glass of fre chardonnay, however the drink my husband got from the bartender he didn't like at all.</text>< pics>

Had lunch there Sunday with out of town family. Very disappointed. Food and service was not what it used to be. AND  restaurant and bathrooms were not clean. Had to beg for ice for ice tea, beg for straws and it seems they were rationing sweet and low. Won't be going back. Will go to Roseville. Shouldn't need to beg when the bill is $$$$<//text>

<text>My husband and I went here for our very first date when we first met and the food is to die for! The best entree is the honey walnut chicken. It has such beautiful flavor. You can taste the honey, the sugars, and I swear I could taste some vanilla and some orange zest in that dish. It is our absolute favorite dish.</text>< gmap_id>

Best food and atmosphere in town! We dined outside as per the current covid rules unlike some other law breaking restaurants in the area. Thank you Fats for your integrity. It will be remembered long after covid is over.< /Text>

<text>Took my husband to Fats for his birthday dinner. We had the worst service tonight. We’ve been coming here for over 10 years. We sat on the patio of course due to Covid. Wasn’t that busy. Our waitress didn’t tell us her name and did not make us feel welcome. We ordered drinks and appetizers. Took a good 20minutes for appetizer to come out. Once our food came we didn’t ever see our waitress again. Then another waitress came to give us more water. No one check on us or ask if we needed anything. Just felt like we were a bother, not a good vibe at all. Sadly we won’t be coming back for awhile.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

< Review>
The only reason it wasn't one star was because of covid and the nice service we received. The caveat on the service was it was super slow but understandable because of the amount of people she was serving.  They seemed to be either out of or running low on a number of drinks we requested. The food ? Well . Sadly the lumpia which was a real treat a while back seems to have been replaced with a bought in version.  Salt and pepper chicken was ok.  My dining companions had the genghis khan beef which was over cooked and the kung pao chicken which was ok.  I had the curried green veggies which was good.  I enjoyed it.  Another negative was we couldn't see , the light near our table was broken so we had to use our cell phone flashlights to see the menus and what we where eating. Not great.
Look , I don't want to pan this joint totally  because I so get we are in dark times and some allowance should be given for that.  Thing is if nothing is said nothing can be addressed ? I will definitely come back and give them another shot once normality retuns because honestly? I have been here a bunch and it never failed to impress.  Great decor and great food.  This time was sadly a let down. However I believe they get a pass here . I shall return.</Review>

High-end Chinese food. A little pricey but worth it. Take-out was good and I noticed they checked to make sure everything was in my order. Hong Kong chow mein was one of our favs as was the dim sum and lumpia. Honey walnut chicken was actually a bit too sweet and one note flavor for me personally but still delicious all the same. Definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants  in town.< /Review>

Disappointing experience.  We made reservations for 6:00 PM and showed up at 6:15 and were seated right away which was nice.  Our server took a while to greet us but we ordered two cocktails and lumpia at 6:30.  Around 6:45 we ordered dinner and at 7:00 no lumpia.  At 7:15 a different server brought two dinners that were not ours, then our server came and said "didn't your order those?" No, I replied and told him what we ordered.  I think the lumpia came out at 7:30 and our dinner shortly after.  The server apologized that he did not place the order correctly but did not offer any remedy.  I am not looking for a free meal but some kind of discount would have been nice or visit from a manager.  Probably will go back but not for a while.<//Review>

<text>Went to Fat's to celebrate a family birthday.  As always, the serving staff was awesome. Kristina was again our server and was tremendous - made our experience that much better. Food was delicious. Had honey walnut prawns, pork fried rice, chicken chow mein & a spicy beef plate. After several visits, I have to say the fried rice is a little salty - this from someone who likes salt in everything. The honey walnut prawns were a little dry and not a large portion for the price.  But, overall a great meal and experience.  The only reason I can't give 5 stars, is the staff at the front. I was the first to arrive of our group. Not only did neither of the young ladies standing there acknowledge me, but even when after a few minutes I stepped into the dining area to see if others from my group was already there and went back to the waiting area, they still did not say a word to me.  When another of our group arrived, he was not greeted or acknowledged either.  As he approached the staff to request a table, they were so busy talking to each other they didn't even look up until he was right in front of them. Luckily, I don't think this is the norm for Fat's.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZ9VhWD9X9MHKiGs4NkV01g25HVvhyzDcDIYfy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipML9hHoX3eS5q2H8Tly1CNl8kCcbUfR-0O0uek3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

Went to Fat's to celebrate a family birthday.  As always, the serving staff was awesome. Kristina was again our server and was tremendous - made our experience that much better. Food was delicious. Had honey walnut prawns, pork fried rice, chicken chow mein & a spicy beef plate. After several visits, I have to say the fried rice is a little salty - this from someone who likes salt in everything. The honey walnut prawns were a little dry and not a large portion for the price.  But, overall a great meal and experience.  The only reason I can't give 5 stars, is the staff at the front. I was the first to arrive of our group. Not only did neither of the young ladies standing there acknowledge me, but even when after a few minutes I stepped into the dining area to see if others from my group was already there and went back to the waiting area, they still did not say a word to me.

Do not come here for the "quarantine food"...my favorite items are ruined and taste nothing like before! Not even the sweet and sour chicken was worth eating...it tasted like someone who has no idea what their doing is following a recipe and winging it. The breading tastes like burnt paste. I hope whatever changes have been made will go back to normal eventually! This food is not cheap, im very disappointed I could have cooked these meals and been happier to save money.<//review>

<review>Noodle Theory is a small gem in Fat's Asia Bistro, Folsom with a great understanding of how to make quality Fat's Asia Bistro, Folsom . I must emphasize the size, of roughly 10-15 tables, so a wait may be required.
My friend and I took Bart over, and it was an easy walk over to the restaurant. The place has both indoor and outdoor seating, but I highly suggest requesting an indoor seat due to the weather and how close the tables are to the street. The employees are very welcoming and down to Earth.

<text>The Fat Pot is the best on the menu in my opinion. Oh, and the Walnut shrimp is also super tasty! So much so that a new-to -America young lady from Thailand, who doesn't care much at all for the food away from her Homeland, really liked it all, including the Dim Sum appetizer. Never ceases to please our guests.</text>< pics>

My company has taken us here two years in a row for our Christmas lunch and both times the food was good. The reason I'm  pushing for a new venue next year is the service! Both times the server was beyond rude and on this visit the server argued with the owner of our company because we waited over 45 minutes for our apps. Party of 20 booked a couple weeks advanced and preordered food, yet we waited and waited.<//Review>

For years, the food, staff and ambience: great. Wanted to support them now. My takeout ítem on Website menu:$16.50. Charged $21.99. Told: "$16.50 was Lunch menu price. We don't do that anymore." WTH?</Review>

<Text>Has anyone ever experienced prejudice from this place? We visited to attend a conference in the area. We look very hispanic I guess because we asked to be seated in a booth and the young girl at the front told us the none was available. I asked about an empty one towards the back and she said it was reserved. I told her we would wait and she ask me to hold on and went to go talk to someone, she came back and said we can sit there. I couldn’t believe it!! I asked her if we would have to leave at a certain time and she said no she will sit the people somewhere else. I MEAN, WHAATT?!?! Yup!! She was definitely discriminating against us!! Our waiter on the other hand was very sweet and attentive. So at least that was a plus! I know everyone in Folsom ain’t prejudice.<//Text>< Pics>

In the last two weeks I have eaten at the restaurant and I also ordered out. My favorite dishes are starting to taste bland - ordered cashew chicken tonight and it had no flavor. The HK Chow Mein was equally bland. There are also a lot of people working at the front desk, but they don’t pay attention to the guests walking in or the the folks waiting for takeout. Poor customer service. The takeout food is also in cheap containers and the name of the restaurant on the bag is Fat City Bar and Cafe.  Not sure who they are or how they are related. The only thing that hasn’t changed about Fat’s are their prices. It is too bad - used to be a good place to go after work or with family.< /review><Rating>2< /Rating><Name>Katalin Walcott<//Name><Gmap_id>0x809ae50faff3efd3:0x3757d2d64ef4a038<//Gmap_id>< time>

Placed an order for pickup..... $71 for 4 items. 2 of which were not edible. The veggie fried rice was undercooked.... the rice and cauliflower were raw. The general’s chicken was so overcooked I couldn’t even cut it with a knife or chew it. Felt like I was eating the  turkey in Christmas Vacation. I expected more from an expensive restaurant like this. Really missing the ma and pop spots that are closed because of Covid-19.<//review>

Pricey Chinese food ( here is a data point for your scale, Hong Kong style pan fried noodle with seafood is $20), but you're paying for the atmosphere and quality of service. They also have a small selection of sushi on the menu. Full bar service for those who enjoy a nice cocktail with meal. General's Chicken was really good. Do check local Costco for discounted gift cards (usually about 20% off).  Great atmosphere  and very friendly service staff(equivalent to PF Chang and Cheesecake Factory).</Review></record>

Service was impeccable. However food was at best comparable to cheap chinese buffet food.
Really disappointed in food quality. Hot oil is definitely not good, far too salty. Not even really anything close to traditional hot oil.
Definitely not quality.</Text>

Great Food and Service! Parking is always Available. Generous portions and great place to share entrees! Love the Ambiance and Design. Tables and Seating can get cramped and over-filled but it's worth it!</text>

The food was tasty and wonderful as usual. Our server Linda did a fuel job. But when it came to desert for 2 birthday people only one banana cream pie came and the 3 coffees were less than Luke warm when asked for hot coffee Linda said tat toffee would be cold, with no explanation. In fact it was cold!  The coffee should have been at least microwaved.  That almost spoiled the dinner. Will write a letter to the gompany.<//review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>The pot stickers come in 4 long pieces. We wanted to order each type of meat but they ran out so we opt for shrimp and pork pot stickers. That wasn't enough for 3 people so we asked for a soup recommendation. She suggested the Spicy fish soup.

Spicy soup with fish ball ($5.99) - Really good. I tasted the numbing spice in this soup. The spam was great balance of the heat.  There are clear noodles at the bottom.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

There’s such thing as too fast of service, especially when going out for a nice dinner. By the time we were sat down the food was on the table in all of about 10 min. Pretty disappointed as this was a special night and it felt very rushed.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x809ae50faff3efd3:0x3757d2d64ef4a038< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The flavours are really clean. You can taste every ingredient.
They serve a generously portion, so go when you're really hungry.
And the service is top!</review>

Places like Fats and PF Chang's put out Panda Express quality food and charge up the yazoo for their meals. This place is horribly overrated. Nice atmosphere. Period. End of sentence.

Food was not as good as I remembered. Calamari was so so. Tasted like it came from a freezer. Sesame chicken was good and the fried rice was good. My jasmine martini was my favorite thing there. Cream cheese ragoon and honey walnut shrimp was ok. But I think it's an overpriced version of panda Express. Not worth the money in my opinion.<//Review>

<text>Made a same-day reservation for dinner here. We ordered the sesame chicken and broccoli beef entrees with a Lava Flow mixed drink and Deschutes Porter. Decent portions and the food was amazingly tasteful. I’m giving this a four stars because I feel like it was a little too expensive.</text>< pics>

First experience was yummy. However, I stopped in only because I really wanted dim sum and the phrase "dim sum bar" led me to believe I'd have more than 3 options to choose from. Hyped myself up too much. Typical dim sum brunches offer 30-50 menu items, in case the owner wasn't aware.

Calypso Freeze was amazing. Kudos to the bartender.

Would be five stars if they did not delude innocent people into thinking they are getting a dim sum experience. Simplify the sub name to Asian Bistro, or Asian Fusion Bistro; if the chef/bartender had an off day this would be a 1 star review.

I'll go back for the drinks and when I feel like having a classier Panda Express experience.</Review>

Our server was Phil. He was most gracious and took the time with small details that really made our experience that much more memorable. He replaced a lime in my drink with an orchid and brought us a small display of different sauces to try with our appetizer. They were all delicious! The food was prepared and presented wonderfully! We also really enjoyed the ambiance.< /Text>

<text>Fat's has a great happy hour selection. The overall presentation is nice, but the food is a bit pricy for the quality. Personally, I'm not a big fan of some Asian fusion food places, I enjoy the more authentic tasting restaurants. However, I do recommend going during happy hour for the feel and taste, so you'll get more bang for your buck. The employees are really nice and they accommodate really well for large parties.</text><rating>3</rating><Gmap_id>0x809ae50faff3efd3:0x3757d2d64ef4a038<//Gmap_id><time>1475873122683<//time><username>Mary Luang</username>< resp>

<Text>I believe, Chinese food, like mexican food need not be expensive to be good . Case in point, the Mongolian beef I ordered. Mushrooms were undercooked along with other veggies. Taste was acceptable but for 21.50 without rice, I expect more. Go elsewhere, your money goes farther in Folsom than here.<//Text><Name>Minako Lopez-Nakayama< /Name>< Resp>

Service was extraordinary, we had a reservation and did not have to wait we were immediately seated, my friend had broken her ankle and they took her little cart and hid it away somewhere so it wasn't in the way and they were totally gracious and volunteered to take it, drinks were wonderful they have a amazing happy hour. I will say I had one of the five dishes that was cold but they made up for it by bringing us a fresh dish and it was very kind of them. The interior is very clean and peaceful relaxing it's nice great ambience.< /Text>

It's been better, both in food and service.  It was a Saturday and the place was pretty empty as we arrived at 615 for our 630 reservation.   When we told the bartender we didn't need menus as we had a reservation he acknowledged us and walked away...guess we don't get a pre-dinner cocktail!  We remained and when a second bartender came over we were able to order cocktails from her.  During our meal, we sat in the outer dining room; the service staff began to close the area by putting the chairs upside down on the adjacent tables as if they planned to close soon (again it's 7pm on a Saturday).  Service was mediocre, it seemed the bus staff paid more attention to us than the wait staff.  Our Son and his girlfriend joined us as it was his birthday.   We recieved a unrequested slice of the infamous (at one time) banana cream pie.  It was also a little cool in the dining area.   Bottom line, go just to say you've been.   It's not as good as it once was.  Frank would not be happy.< /Text>

<Text>Made a reservation for 15 people at 6pm on a Saturday night, we were seated at 6 PM. No waiting for tables to be rearranged or having to wait for everyone to be present before being seated. The service was great, even with the multiple large prom partys the service want affected. The appetizers were good, the calamari is the best I have had and the biggest bang for your buck. The food was great portions were good, will definitely go back< /Text>< pics>

Excellent food and service. Made a reservation and was seated within three minutes of arrival. Ambiance was pleasant but a tad noisy. Waiters were pleasant and knowledgeable. Food was second to none. Only complaint was having to eat under a nine foot tall Buddha! Really? Otherwise an excellent experience.< /Review>

Food was very good. Only big problem with our large birthday party was that  the hostess blew the surprise by asking us if we were there for the surprise party!!!! Really??? and the other big problem was that all the food did not come out at the same time. Other than that, our waiter was very friendly and did a good job.</text>

I've been to Fats Asia Bistro twice. The first time was for my birthday dinner with fiends, and while the food and experience were great, I wouldn't take the time to write a review. But I was so moved by yesterday's experience that I had to share.

It was our 9 year anniversary and my wife and I were wanting some kind of Asian fare. We settled on Fats. I called in ahead of time as I do with most restaurants to ask where the beef is sourced from. I do this because we have special dietary restrictions and certain farms cater to that. Sometimes we get lucky, usually we don't.
I spoke to Chef Dan over the phone who was a wealth of information and took careful time to explain to me which beef dishes would accommodate our preference. He even said he would tack on a note to our reservation so our server would know.

Upon entering Fats we were greeted by the Nicest  manager (Morgan) who said she would come by later to talk to us about something special the chef did for us.
Later she came by to tell us (customized menu in hand) that chef Dan had not only listed what dishes met our dietary restriction on the sheet, he has also prepared meat from the local farm separately so we could choose any item and have it substituted with that beef! We were blown away!!!!
We ordered crab Rangoons, shrimp dumplings (another special order) the Genghis beef, and the imperial rice. We topped it off with banana cream pie, the flourless chocolate cake and coffee. Every. Single. Item was delicious. The beef was tender through and through and we could tell it was a quality cut. Our server was lovely and attentive (I am so sorry I am forgetting your name as I type this ) and the ambiance was perfect. If I could give 5 extra stars I would.
My wife and I are big on service so if even the food is amazing but the service is Subpar, we won’t enjoy our time but literally EVERYTHING was perfect!
Morgan thank you for having such a wonderful demeanor. And chef Dan, you put integrity into your work, we appreciate you making our 9th anniversary special for us!<//text>

Good food, poor service. When we arrived the hostess asked if we would be Done by 6pm because they had another reservation. We waited over 15min then finally asked for a server. No one ever came by to get our drinks or anything. When the food was brought to the table the server cleared my husbands Clean silverware. I said something and his response was “oh I thought no one was there”. He had stepped out to take our child to the restroom. Then he said he would bring back New silverware and Never did. Then we were brought the Wrong to go order.
Not going back< /Text>

I literally travel thousands of miles to come back to eat here.  This is the best Chinese I've ever had.  The closest I can come is Debby Wong's in El Dorado Hills.

This has a very PF Chang's vibe to it.  The interior of this location is spectacular.  The photos of the Buddha on here do not do it justice.  The trees are palms that have been hallowed out and "mummified". Quite spectacular.

The food is top notch. 👌 The honey Walnut shrimp are phenomenal. A must, and if you come on a Tuesday, they are on happy hour.. Just a thought.  The lomein (here called chow mein)is so light and delicious, it is like none you've ever had.  The veggies are about primavera and the sauce, light and fresh.

Their white rice is made with some of the finest Jasmine rice and is served hot and fluffy.

Their general tao's is wonderful and their Mongolian beef is delightful. For vegetarian options try their tofu.

Their bar menu is extensive and has a wine to pair with any meal.

It's always such a pleasure coming back. Thank you Mr. Frank Fat and family for allowing us into your home and sharing with Sacramento the delights of your cooking.< /Text>

<text>We recently stopped and ordered take out for lunch for a family members birthday.  Not cheap,  which is fine and expected, but we all were very disappointed with the food.  The main thing being we received no condiments,  they ones that are necessary when eattibg this type of food.  No soy sauce,  and more importantly no oyster sauce to go with chicken lettuce cups. We also asked for white rice no edamame, and got edamame and no white rice. It was just a lot considering the cost.  If it has been a local mom and pops place I wouldn't have cared as much. I guess I've expected more the more you pay. Very disappointing experience. No more take out for us.< /text>< pictures>

The waitress was not helpful until leaving and watched how she helped others. Food was pricey for mediocre taste. Honey walnut prawns with no rice or vegetables for $22 when I could go to Chinese food place and get vegetable included for much less.< /text>

<review>Sat at bar for Happy Hour tonight. Food was good. Bartender serving us, not so much. Waited 10 min and then had to ask to order drinks. Again, had to ask to order food.  We sat there for approx 30 min after eating, with empty glasses, finally asking for bill. Bartender was VERY loud and too busy socializing to give most of the customers even mediocre service.

<text>Very good food.  We went for a night out and had a good time.  The Peiking duck was very good as well as the lumpia.  It was very busy and they DO take reservations.  We had one and we were seated within a couple minutes of arriving.  I would go back.  I really like the palm trees with lights on them in the restaurant and the fountains outside.  Makes for great atmosphere.  It was a bit loud and hard to hear my dinner companions but we just spoke up.< /text>< Pictures>

Went there for our anniversary.  Waitress took our order and she never came back to ask if our meals were satisfactory or even if we needed more water.  She passed our table at least 4 times never glancing over at us.  My wife ask too see the manager spoke her peace to her then finally after manager spoke with the waitress and finally the waitress came back and said we could have a free desert.  No apologies from the waitress.  Will make sure we tell as many folks as we can about this crappy experience and will never come back to here again</text>

Service was slow, as usual, but more so, even with most tables empty. The 'lumpia' starter was only won-ton wrappers around Chinese sausages, deep-fried. Salad greens were decaying. I can't recall the entrees - OK, I guess. We used to go to Fat's to celebrate. Never again.< /text>

< Review>
Upscale outpost of the famous Frank Fat's in Sacramento.

Beautifully decorated, great quality, and usually good service.

It is the most expensive Chinese joint in town, but their popularity suggests it is worth it.

Popular for happy hour.<//Review>

When we went for lunch on a Sunday, there were not many servers and there was a long wait time for our food, even though we got a reservation. They still had outstanding food nevertheless.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

As much as we like Frank's, it seems like it's been hit or miss lately. We had a small to go order, ribs, calimari ang Kung Pao chicken. Everything taste good, except the amount of chicken in the Kung Pao dish was severely lacking. Not to mention the overall size of the dish was lacking compared to what you get when you dine in. On the other hand, the amount of calimari was as I would have expected.< /Text>

First time dining here. Great atmosphere, although the open floor plan of the dinning area looks nice, it is very loud. You can here the noise from the kitchen and have to speak loudly just to conversate with your company. The food was over priced and less than par in flavor. Presentation was great. Service was friendly, and food was served in a timely manner. Drinks were flat. I will not recommend this restaurant or come back.<//review>

Fat's Asia Bistro in Folsom is a nice, classy place to go out to eat. The bartender mixed a great long island ice tea for me, so that set the tone for the rest of the night. Food was served in reasonable amount of time and tasted good.  I will return again!<//review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Fats has a gorgeous environment with the giant golden buddha and stunning indoor palm trees. The wait staff are incredibly friendly and the food is great. Many chinese restaurants use lots of grease and extremely processed ingredients but Fat's is very natural and clean tasting. They offer some sushi as well as standard chinese dishes. This is the perfect place to take a date. I highly recommend the sweet and sour pork, steak kew, and honey walnut prawns. Finish it off with a slice of their famous banana cream pie. It's famous for a reason!<//text>< Pics>

I could taste no alcohol, it tastes more like Sprite with cucumber and lemon with tons of ice. It was $10.50. we ended up leaving after 1 drink without even getting an appetizer.</text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Text>Even though this is not a sushi bar,  they have some of the best sushi ever, and all around some of the best Asian food and desserts. You can sometimes get gift cards worth $100 for about $80 at local Costco too.

<text>I had the worst service ever today. I waited for 15 minutes for my server to bring sweetner for my ice tea. I finally went up to the hostess to get the sweetner. The server still didn't even know I went and got it myself. The  server and the manager where just talking away and ignored us. The couple sitting next to never got their tea at all they had to ask the bus boy. I always make a trip here when I come to visit Sacramento. The bathrooms were dirty also. The food was delicious but I will never come back to this restaurant in Folsom. I guess it's back to the Fat's downtown.< /text><user>115728467324291031906<//user><username>shari Huston<//username><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< rate>

Poor service.  Started with hostess.  Said 25 minute wait, sat tables out of order, then lied to say she said 1 hour.  Went downhill from there.  Great food, great experiences before but bad management now.</text>

Food is decent but pricey. They took off their most popular menu item (almond chicken) because it was hard to prepare. Rice and chow mein have very little flavor.<//Review>

Unfortunately our appetizer and entree came out at the same time which made our food cold. When we asked server,  he said that's our kitchen for you. Mens restroom was poorly maintained.<//review>

<Review>Beef and prawns with bell peppers was not flavorful. The serving size was smaller than I had expected. Service was very fast that the meal for myself arrived quickly in 10 minutes or less. It's an expensive yet small meal .</Review>< Pics>

If you don't mind dropping close to $75 for three for lunch (including 3 sodas and one entrée each) for flavorless food this the place for you. I shudder at the thought of every returning. Raleys and Panda Express has more flavor and that's a pretty sad statement.<//text>

<text>Great atmosphere and attentive staff. Food seems pricy at first glance, but the portions are generous. Corner location at E. Bidwell, but no access to the restaurant from E. Bidwell, meaning you could end up having to drive a ways if you miss it the first time.< /text><gmapID>0x809ae50faff3efd3:0x3757d2d64ef4a038< /gmapID>< response>

<Review>Review: Asian Bistro FATS in Folsom/Don't Go There!

Their Pan noodles were tasteless and not cooked enough. I couldn't get our waitress the entire night.She delivered one drink and the other wait staff covered everything else. We were a party of 3 that paid 200 dollars for our meal. I personally ordered the "Szechuan Beef" which the chef was supposed to: toss beef with soy sauce, cornstarch, crushed red pepper and garlic in non-metal bowl. Cover and refrigerate 20 minutes. Heat oil in wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir fry beef until no longer pink, 5 minutes.

He kept dipping my Szechuan beef into flour or the corn starch and  frying it!!! What tha hell? I had a waiter that wasn't even designated to wait our section take it back and explain to the chef I don't want my beef dipped and fried. A female hostess brought back a second and it was again dipped and fried. The whole experience was turning bad. I contacted a manager and she is a night manager on Sunday so she's lucky I forget her name but I've seen more personality from a storage drain.She was very cold and non professional. She did nothing about the waitress that would never come to the table so I simply said take this beef back and we'll take it to go. Again! I told her personally not to dip and fry my beef.That's not how you make Szechuan Beef. The corn starch goes a little in the gravy part but you never dip your beef and fry it in that dish. Un Freaking believable!!! The to-go Szechuan Beef was again dipped in flour and fried. My mother is disabled and reaching for rice she accidentally spilled my 50 dollar drink.It was full. You better believe she wouldn't replace my beverage.That manager never even offered napkins! She was rude and she made excuses as if my sister and I were retarded. We're in our 40's BTW. Horrible! Panda Express has better Chinese Food. This food is so over priced one can only wonder but if the chef can't even prepare something simple or listen to detail on top of rude staff members then who needs to spend 200 dollars for food that worse than fast food. Never go there!< /Review>< Pics>

Delicious food, not super authentic though. It took 45 minutes to receive the bill and we never were able to get refills on water or any other beverages. I hope I came on a bad night and that it isn't always like this.<//Text>

Lunch on Sunday
Service was good/friendly
Wait staff noted my preference, but when meal arrived they made many mistakes
Tom had lemon shrimp, almost all lemon flavor.
Just OK Today, haven't been in a while, not planning to come back soon</review>

<review>Great happy hour but everything is expensive afterwards, bring lots of money because it can get expensive. Also make a reservation, they are busy in the evenings and weekend.<//review>< GmapID>

Came here for Dim Sum and there were only two options. I asked my waitress if there were more, or a cart they bring around and she said no. Why have dim sum in the name if you don't plan to serve more than two items?<//Text>

<text>I've been here twice with groups from work and both times it has been disappointing. The food is not prepared well (undercooked batter, rubbery chicken, overcooked seafood) and is extremely bland. I'd rather eat at Panda Express.< /text>< pictures>

<text>(Translated by Google) First time in place. I am not a fan of Asian food so it was difficult to ask for something. In the end we ordered a ticket and a main course to share with my sister. The food was good and we left satisfied.
