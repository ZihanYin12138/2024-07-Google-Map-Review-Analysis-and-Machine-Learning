< Review>
This place gets the job done with a traditional soa brush wash and rinse. I don't recommend the contactless soap spray option as the times I have used them they don't really get a good mix of soap to water. The drying station that follows after the wash occasionally has people taking their time or just waiting for something so be prepared to either dry off behind them as they sit and wait for the water to evaporate or drive to the sides of any other drying station. Most of the time they have an attendant there with a bright orange shirt who is helpful in breaking larger bills for 1's,5's,and 10's.<//Review>

It's a small place but okay for the most part, unless you get a bay that doesn't have enough pressure to get the crud off your car. The one annoying thing here are the people who think the dry area is their personal bay and take forever to move.</Review>

<text>They pretty much got it all. Good brushes, good water pressure,  change machines, vacuum stations In front and in back where you can dry your car. Most of the stall dispensers except 5’s and 1 dollar bills, they have rinse, soap with brush, spray soap, and wax. Timer beeps to notify it’s cycle is about to run out, it’s open super late, maybe all night and I go pretty late to avoid crowds. There is a running water rinse station AND a old style “towel ringer”? I didn’t even know what that was for. It doesn’t have spot free rinse, and I don’t think it changes 20 dollar bills. I think they should expand.< /text><GmapID>0x80c2c5118d3f787f:0xfc87c5cc8fafbea2<//GmapID>< Response>

The staff who works here is friendly and helpful. He explains things and makes sure you know how to use the vacuum and so on. I wish the timer did not run too fast. For a self wash, I would expect a maximum of $5 out of my pocket. In real, it may be more than that to finish one car, not to mention the vacuum.</review>

It is only $2.25 for 3 1/2 minutes of time. Time goes by fast. You need to put 5 dollars to get a good wash. Do it yourself car wash. They have 5 drive ins with high water pressure hoses. The high pressure water is no good for tires. Also if you spray water in the engine it can damage the alternator and wires in the engine. Then the other day I was rinsing my car and the high pressure water broke my car passenger window. I don’t recommend this place based on what happen to my car and just in general. They have vacuum for $1.00 dollar for a few minutes so that works great. The good thing about this place is that you can come and clean up your car inside and out. Just the washing part is not the good thing. I’am thinking the temperature had something to do with it, but who knows I just replaced it at Safelite Autoglass.</text>

Typical Coin-Op Car wash. This car wash location gets crowded easily
but if you bring your car during the weekdays you'll get a spot. Easy access from the blvd or the side streets. Water pressure is strong. Vacuum air pressure is powerful. It has  vending  machine supplies for all your cleaning materials.</Review>

Good for when you're in a pinch and need to have your car washed. I spent about $7 for just the wash, no vacuum. I'd rather go to one of those semi-service ones fast provide free vacuums... But there aren't any in the area. The closest thing is the 7-11 on Poplar and Huntington.... There's a guy who dries and dresses the tires.< /review>

My only beef is that the vacuums here are so weak they're useless. I finished vacuuming at home.

Don't forget your microfiber towels. They have those crappy vending machine rags here that I only use in a pinch.</review><username>Gregory Tada< /username>< time>

It's nice but the machines run out to fast and they could sure use some remodeling to make the place look nice.</review>

<Text>Went in the evening after 8pm. And it was popular and busy.
Machine costs 2.25. And 1.00 for vacume. Lots of people washing there cars, no problems. I'll wash my car more often.<//Text>< date>

Place can get crowded at times.  Basic coin car wash, but good that they take bills too.  I like that they put shade covers in to give you an area to dry your car.  Wish they'd upgrade the large brushes used to wash the cars,  they're looking a little old.< /Text>

1$ - two pieces of cloth for wiping

<Review>A great car wash that has everything you need for a basic wash. The only issues are that it gets very busy and you may wait in a line or not have a spot to dry your car. There are also a lot of solicitors at the car wash constantly harassing customers in a very pushy manner. I try to get in and get out of this spot to avoid the rude solicitors.< /Review>< pictures>

It's very convenient very unexpensive do it yourself car wash I like the new highrise umbrellas to keep the shade while you're drying your car and you also detail your car with your own wax. Friendly customers.<//text>

I like it because it accepts dollar bills not just quarters. I've found that the spots closer to the change machine have higher pressure. It does not have a tire cleaner like all of the other places ice been.</review>

Mittapheap means friendship/friendliness...

We are travelers and we came to this restaurant per Google's recommendation. Thanks Google. What we got was the friendliest service as the name implies and the tastiest of Phnom Penh noodle soup we've ever had in a long time. Good price per serving as well. Google recommended to me. Now I strongly recommend it to you. They also make good Mee-Ka-Tangg. We had it in combination. Very good.< /Text>

Mitapheap is my go-to spot for Cambodian noodles in Stockton. The beef noodle soup is delicious. Tasty clean broth and lots of noodles to make sure you're satiated. The chow fun is also a must.<//Text>

<Review>The pho has a unique flavor compared to Pho Lucky. Not saying it's a bad thing for either place. It's whatever you feel like at the moment. I wish this place was open more reliability.<//Review></record>

< Review>
Store staff are great, but they are let down by the parent company (or whoever manages their web site).  The Santa Barbara store web site indicates the store stocks golf shoes.  I drove ~ 40 miles to the store on State Street to be told they stock no golf shoes.  I guess I should have telephoned first to be certain, but since the web site was so specific, I assumed golf shoes would be available.  Ironically, the advertising video playing on the large TV in the store highlighted how good the Skechers golf shoes are.  I guess I have to buy them on-line to find out.  I did buy a pair of walking shoes, so at least the trip was not a complete waste of time.< /Review>

Service was severely lacking. And background music was too loud and jarring, making me want to just escape the store and shop at Amazon.</review>

The sales girl that helped me was so personable and very friendly. She went out of her way to help find what I needed. I wear a size 10 wide shoe and I told her what I was looking for and she brought out every option they had and finding decent wide shoes is not easy because not alot of people wear a wide shoe. I'd shop there again.< /text>

My burrito was ready ahead of time for pick up but the actual presentation of the burrito was off.
It looks a bit like a hamster!?
The cheese was all at one end and to top it off there was gristle in the meat!< /text>

I come here at least once a week to pick up lunch that I order through the app and my order is always right and ready within the time frame given. Really nice people who work there.

I love Chipotle Mexican Grill.  I can't make it out here all the time like I did when I was a kid, but the burritos are still excellent.  Nothing beats the food I ate in mexico, but this comes pretty darn close.< /Text>

The menu on the wall is inconveniently hidden by a big metal thing so you get to stretch your neck a lot when you are in line.
Enjoy the salsa bar and vegetarians rejoice! They have protein!
If you still have room in your tummy get an alfajor( Argentinian cookie that reminds you of winter holidays)</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

< Review>
¡Dame más tacos por favor! Yum! We stopped by here for some late night tacos.. The place was busy but they get you through the line and served quickly! We split the 3 tacos- shrimp, carnitas, and al pastor... All were great but my favorite was the pastor!! They give you complimentary chips so be sure to check out the salsa bar!! Fresh, house made, spicy salsas (as good as my Mexican host mom used to make!!)  We also ordered a mango agua fresca.... Get a large....you will be glad you did!!</Review>

Ive been coming here for years and its always been great but they recently hired this short white dude that is terrible! He slaps all the food in your bowl like hes in a rush and sometimes misses the scoops completely. When you ask him to put a little more he is super condescending! I try to avoid him as my server and I would recommend it to everyone else! They need to retrain him and teach him not to rush. He’s actually fu**ing terrible!</text>

One of the better locations. Portions are on the smaller side. Last time I got chips they tasted plain, no lime or salt flavors. And they almost forgot to put them in my bag. Otherwise haven't had an issue.< /review>

This Chipotle has a small parking lot, but the service is awesome and the food is delicious. Plus they do a good job of keeping it clean! I never seem to have any trouble with long lines or bad quality food, and the employees are super chill. They could keep the utensils and napkins stocked a bit more, but that is something small!<//review>

<review>Today was only my second time going there, all i can say is " Oh my god " those burritos are so freaking big that when they were putting it together i said out loud how am i ever going to eat that ???!!! The average person will need help!! They give you very very generous portions to where it looks like they can't even close it ..but they do... Going there is money well spent, and they are very nice staff and the place is very clean and comfortable, with plenty of seating and parking in the back... I give it ten stars.....😊😊<//review>< Pictures>

If you've ever been to a Chipotle before, this is one of those. They make the kind of food a Chipotle would make... Because they are one. So if you're in the mood for Chipotle, I'm confident this place will do the trick.</Review>

my daughter's love the food. I love the fact that it's quick enough to go in and out like fast food but it's healthy enough like homemade food it's a win-win.
Plus 1 of their NEWER evening supervisors, Susie she is the best, great customer service, great smile, great personality. ALL their employees should be MORE like her.<//Text>

I got the sampler appetizer platter (which was great) and then the sea bass (which was even better).  I definitely recommend pairing the meal with a glass/bottle of wine.<//Text>< Pics>

Oh man. This is best chipotle location in America. Let me tell you how juicy their steak was. The kind of steak you always hope and dream you'll get at chipotle but it's always just "good". This locations steak was 5 star perfection. Their beans and rice were cooked and spiced perfectly. The customer service was so warm and inviting. So friendly and genuine. I love chipotle. I go a couple times a week but not this location. This made my night so much better. Thank you guys!!!</Text>

<review>i come often - a fajita burrito that is tasty and is a meal in itself, plus some chips. fresh guacomole and a beer - what more could one want? the best of the burrito chains - the cilantro in the rice makes it special.  if you want it fast, but high quality - this is your place.  the decor is a bit "steel-like".</review>< Time>

<review>This is my favorite chipotle because I won their raffle one month and got to have burritos for 12 people!  So, that was fun :)

We used to come here a lot for lunch and it was always just fine.  We did have one incident when ordering online for food for a group lunch and it ended up being a disaster.  Somehow the order didn't go through and they were totally unsympathetic to the plight. But, stuff happens.< /review>< pictures>

On 10/14/18 i walked in at 9:10( according their website its open until 10), and, not only was invited by uninvited glares, all the food was put away and i was told they were closed. Strange how last Sunday i ate their around 9:30. I guess what more to expect from a fast food in Beverly hills: not great service thats for sure.< /review>< Rate>

And I want to keep in mind I am a customer that used to emphasize the word used to go to chipotle at least four times a week
One thing that is horrible about the chipotle brand is the consistency it’s horrible
The portion size is horrible then you have to fight with a young kid with an attitude to make a normal size bowl
What is wrong with you people as a company get some kind a portion cups instead of letting kids with attitudes your employees make every bowl a different size
That’s why am not a customer anymore one day they give me a heaping spoonful of chicken the next day a bunch a little cut up pieces They do not even make a full spoonful then if you asked for more please politely you get an attitude we have to double charged you for meat I should take pictures of the servings but I have to deal with any stress going to any place to eat it’s not a place that I go anymore it shouldn’t happen<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c2b978c7349375:0xad9f507e002f853d< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The food was bland, the restaurant was clean. The team members kept yelling at each other. Super unprofessional.  Susanna, the cashier kept yelling "working" from the dining room, really loud. I had to leave! I will never be back.< /Text>

spices in food not to everyoneæs taste.  best to order food as a salad rather than in a burrito or taco.  dedicated to responsible food with concerns for food allergies.  all ingredients are clearly stated so safe for vegans, vegetarians and special diets.< /review>

If you like chipotle, its like any other chipotle. If you like chipotle and the convenience of it being within a mall, this chipotle will disappoint. If you don't mind being in the mall, then having a strong craving for chipotle and realizing you have to exit the mall to get your chipotle fix, then you should be fine with this one.< /Review>

Literally the worst chipotle I've ever been to. Go to the one at the farmer's market instead. The food tastes different, and they ran out of white rice at 7pm on a Saturday evening. How does that even happen?< /text>

great burritos that are prepared in an assembly line in front of you, helping you to feel like it might be even fresher than it really is.  the lime-hinted tortilla chips are a staple.</review>

Teresa O was very professional and courteous. I went into the store to buy a charge cord and not only did she help me with the cord, but she also let me charge my phone in her store and i left there with my bill being about $70 cheaper a month. I didnt even have to ask. She just looked up my account and deducted things i didnt need, and she was great!</Text>

<Review>I recently lost my mother days prior to going into the store. Since her passing on 12/30/20, Confronting people and being social has been tough for me. I have taken over her account & now added wireless. S

I went into At&t on Fair oaks to pick up my newly ordered phone. Angel immediately welcomed me. He quickly got me on my way. I’m grateful for his welcoming customer service, quick to help, empathy to my disruption & a professional employee.<//Review>< Pics>

Real Great Experience at the AT&T in South Pass

1. 10 seconds a rep helped us out

2. Got a plan set up with my phone

3. Xbox and PS5 was a Topic during Set up

COVID -19 measures were perfect, Plastic glass with talk to a employee 6 Ft was applied

The best experience I’ve had in a while

Thanks AT&T South Pasadena

<review>Danny and Mauricio were fantastic. They handled the obstacles of COVID-19 protocol with grace. Despite having a busy shop, they greeted everyone warmly, and with great teamwork they managed to take care of every customer in a timely manner. I particularly appreciated their patience with me, as I got a new phone and had a lot of questions which they throughly answered. Also they were great at selling me things I actually needed and also helped me save money. Thank you again!<//review>< Pics>

I hope everyone cancels all services with this company, like I’m doing at the end of the month. I was charged a 90$ fee that I was told by multiple managers I would not be charged for cancelling internet. This is on a contract that I was illegally put into, because I never agreed to or signed. When I called back to have the issue fixed they simply said that they were “sorry” but could not refund or credit my money back. Instead they promised to investigate the managers involved and “take action”. No one cares about your apologies AT&T!!! To make matters worse they said if I decided to get into an internet contract with them again the fee’s could be waived. This was after talking to a supervisor for an hour who repeatedly said nothing could be done. The supervisor was Brandy employee number MM493X. When I asked to speak to the legal department she said that I would have to look for that on my own and refused to provide me with any additional information or management to solve the issue. This company is completely unprofessional and me and my family will not be providing you with any business moving forward.</Text>

I don’t get very many excellent customer experiences these days and in fact I hardly get good ones so when it comes my way it I always want to applaud it.  Rene who I met with me my first time and Monica when I returned the next were exceptional.  My situation was confusing after moving from one coast to the other and having multiple carriers with multiple lines.  They both helped me sort it out and clearly understand my options.  Rene was even willing to stay after closing hours to help me as I waited on hold for a family member to retrieve a PIN number from a former phone carrier.  Monica helped with with complete focus and still kept an eye on customers entering the store by greeting them and telling them she would be right with them after helping me all the while never losing her focus on me.  That’s a fine art!  Great job guys!<//text>

This service is the absolute worst service I have ever had. I tried to change my auto pay plan to a cheaper one and when I did, they charged me the original higher price plan that I was on, but gave me the cheaper phone service which is terrible service. When I called to explain they wouldn’t refund the difference and wouldn’t give me the service I was charged. And on top of that they were extremely rude about it. I am switching my phone service ASAP</Review>

<text>I looked up the nearest store to me on google and the store on Colorado Blvd came up. I went there and the place looked like a zoo, you had to take a number and wait to be called as if you were visiting the DMV, and don’t get me started on the parking. Once I finally got to a rep, almost an hour later, he said he couldn’t help with my issue at the store and that I had to call the insurance company myself in order to place a claim to get a new phone. I tried calling the insurance company on my own but they requested documentation that I was clueless on how to get it from and much less how to fill it all out. To make a long story short, I was driving down Fair Oaks and noticed this little store and decided to give it a try. Finding parking was the easiest thing, as they have a parking lot right next to them, and as soon as I stepped foot in the door I was greeted by Diana. She is amazing! Not only did she take the time to look up my account, but she also discovered that I was due for an upgrade and she suggested I change my plan to the new unlimited plan AT&T offers saving me tons of money on overage fees. I came out of that store with a new iPhone X phone, with a great plan and the best of all with free HBO on my phone.  I didn’t have to use my insurance which I was so happy about because I was dreading the whole documentation fiasco they asked for. I am definitely making this my to go AT&T store. I am so glad I decided to stop by. The whole environment is so much different from the other store in Old Town Pasadens. The store was super clean and it smelled good. I noticed the other reps helping other customers and they all had a similar demeanor as Diana did. They were nice and kind to the customers they were helping and not once did I feel uncomfortable. Everything was done so efficiently and in less time than I had spent waiting to be helped at the other store. This was by far the best AT&T store I’ve been to.< /text>< Pictures>

< review>
In addition to being unable to get us a working phone plan,  the employee was condescending without even having the knowledge to justify it.  He showed us information in the computer that was 3 years out of date and was rude when we pointed out it was old.  He told us incorrect information.  He could not find order information in the system from a week or two prior.  He didn't really understand the computer system, saying some numbers that were on his screen shouldn't be there (employees at other locations verified it should).  Finally, despite being unable to get SIM cards for our phones, he tried to push a larger data plan on us anyway.<//review>

They only have the ATT robot answer the phone, and "he" is very stupid, and can't answer the simplest programs.  "He" only wants your credit card number, doesn't understand anything else.  Does ATT care? No!< /Text>

The management team here is absolutely disgraceful. The shift manager that assisted me today(whose name I will not list starts with an "M")is an example of what is wrong with young people today. Unfortunately the store manager (who was not present)lacks the insight to identify a lack of maturity her employees. I came into the store to return merchandise and the credit card machine would not process my return. My options were to either exchange, come back another day or wait for the IT department to answer the phone to fix the machine.
Apparently this issue has been ongoing and is not yet resolved. This young female handled the situation so poorly with such a disrespectful attitude that I am still in shock. I even attempted to point out to her calmly if she recognized that she was rolling her eyes and appeared to be irritated. She was snappy and had a smart remark for every single question or comment that I made. I asked her if she realized that this was an inconvenience . She said that it was an inconvenience for her as well. Before I left I told her that the disappointing part is that even when I leave she needs to stay on the phone to resolve the problem rather than wait for the next person to come in and experience the same issue. She hung up the phone right in front of me. I will never spend my money here again. Hopefully the ownership of this location specifically will take measures to address management here. I guarantee that they are doing more harm than good. Needless to say my issue is still unresolved, but tomorrow is another day.</Review>

Very nicely designed, clean library. My only two gripes are there aren't enough power outlets for laptops and the wooden seats get uncomfortable quickly.</text>

Great local library with modern facility and good selection of materials beyond just books. Is large enough that you can easily find a good place to read or work. Also, their website is easy to use and schedule items for pickup. Great online resources such as Consumer Reports and Lynda Learning come with your SCCL account!< /text>

<Text>I love the new library.  The terminals make checkout a breeze - no waiting.  Everyone that I've encountered that works there have been very helpful.
I would give them 5 stars except their new book selections are limited by finances and they aren't open on Sundays or Mondays.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Quite difficult to play Minecraft. But overall very nice and safe. I totally recommend going there. Very cool inside, very nice employees, the security guard is wonderful! Very clean. I've never had a problem with this library. I love it there, They have very fun people that go there such as The Bubble Lady, Roy The Reptile Guy. It's so amazing. They even have days where you can go read to a dog! It's AMAZING! There vending machine is almost always full with healthy and unhealthy treats. There is this program where you can teach an adult to read. And if you don't have a library card sometimes there is this room where you can go to play Minecraft with other people. It's wonderful!!!!!!! C: c:<//Review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Review>Nothing bad to say about the library, itself. Frustrating note about Google, however. I've sent 2 edits to Google about the library's location. Both had "Actions Taken" without editing anything.

Thanks for finally doing something 5 months after the 2nd request for edit. You might want to get google maps to actually face the library now.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<review>Great experience! I was made completely comfortable and well taken care of. Even though they have to monitor you with tons of wires hooked up to you it was easy to fall asleep. It was a nice cool night sleep for a hot sleeper like myself. Nurse was Excellent at communicating everything that I need to know about the study and made me feel comfortable and well taken care of. Thank You!< /review>< response>

This was a very easy and pleasant stay for my sleep test.  Nichole was just a great person with a great personality to administer the procedure.  The condititions for a good sleep were above my expectations, and I had a good night sleep.  And, there's a Starbucks just a few blocks away for my required morning brew!< /Text>

<Text>I went there with my 17 yo son to get a sleep study. Since he’s a minor I had to stay with him which was fine except wasn’t happy that I slept in a chair. I was offered a cot and told I could sleep in bed with my son but like I said he’s 17. Needless to say I didn’t sleep well because of the sleeping arrangements. It would have been nice to have a bed even a twin would have been more comfortable. The tech was awesome! Very knowledgeable and friendly. Overall good with exceptions on accommodations for parents taking their teenage boys. Would have been different if it was me n my teenage daughter but not my son.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The home test was easy but I wonder if it gives the kind of data of a true sleep study. It seemed rather shallow as a study, but if it gives full data, I guess it's okay. The equipment was fine and the staff was professional and courteous.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

The facility was very nice, almost like staying in a hotel.  The tech on duty (Dane) was very professional.  Explained every detail as we went along and was very reassuring. I did put on the CPAP about halfway through the night and not having used it before, it took some getting used to.  Again, Dane was very supportive.< /review>

I was amazed at the professenalism and friendliness of the staff. They explained what was to happen and quickly disspelled my anxiety. I  fell asleep quickly and had a wonderful night's sleep.  The facilities and bed were clean and comfortable. Only 1 problem..nobody gave me an explanation of what to expect.  No written instructions either.  Need to get this information to patient!< /Text>

<Review>The Palm Springs office is wonderful. An awesome experience!
Well. That's over now. I came away with a CPAP and all interactions with Advanced Sleep Medicine people are bogged down and fraught. No one speaks English. They won't answer the phone, my supplies are 3 months out of date and no one can help me. My multi-thousand dollar CPAP is now a doorstop.</Review>< Pictures>

My husband and I were there last night. The two techs were knowledgeable and put both my husband and myself at ease. The building outside is well kept up. The accommodations were clean and comfortable.  I now know why I'm tired most of the day. This morning is the best I've felt in YEARS!
This is the place to go  if you need to be tested for sleep apnea.< /Review>

Terrible experience. The guy Sleep technician was rude.
At the end he is very reluctant to wipe out connection points over the head and face leaving you go home with horrible looks of messed hair and face while going for everyone to see coming back from a horrible place.
But when I insisted was rude gave me tissue paper telling you have to clean your self.
I said I can’t see what is over my head then he was very rude and reluctantly or half heartily partially wiped making no difference still left me going home ugly looking face.

I said why did you not having small hand towels available then He blamed  the management don’t give any towel.

He didn’t know how to wrap around blanket around the feet leaving me with cold feet.

He had mask set on high pressure causing more disturbed sleep and messing up with the sleep results/assessment. He is very angry and rude guy more over how Sleep results could be reliable.</text>

We had an amazing experience working with Dan and his team at Solcosta Home Loans.

We were nervous about the ReFi process because of the conditions of our original loan but our monthly payments were outrageous so we finally reached out and explained that we wanted to lower our rate, reduce our monthly payment and pay off our silent second loan.

In working with Dan and his team we were able to accomplish everything! We reduced our rate, lowered our monthly by more than $500 and paid off the second loan.

I cant say enough about how professional, knowledgeable and constantly available everyone was. No matter what we needed or what question we had,  a team member was always there to take care of us.

I would absolutely recommend them to my friends and family!< /Text>

Dan and his team made buying a house such a simple task with how they handle everything. Dan's professionalism is elite and the quality of help and services they provided exceeded expectations, even in this pandemic. Everything was fast and efficient and easily 5 star service. His constant communication is exactly what you want during a time of house buying. Him and his team closed in under 17 days easily (i dont remember the exact days) and im positive they could have done it quicker if needed. I highly recommend Dan and his team of Solcosta Home Loans to everyone. They wont disappoint. Look foward to working with Dan and his team in the future. Thank you for the A+ service Solcosta Home Loans!<//Review><Response>{'time': 1620004164516, 'text': 'Jason, this review made my day! Thank you so much for the kind words.

<text>Dan Patty at Solcosta made our experience with this home purchase so simple. We were working with another lender before Dan but after talking with him and the way he responded almost instantly to all questions and request, we knew this was the person we wanted to work with and it turned out to be the perfect business transaction. We highly recommend him to anyone looking for a home loan.< /text>< pics>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Rating>5</Rating><review>As a brand new home owner going into 2021, there is a lot to say about Dan Patty and Solcosta Home Loans. Previous to working with Dan I had an extremely bad experience with a lender where he was very rude, unresponsive, and at one point I asked him to run some numbers for me so I can see how much I needed to save up and he replied with “give me a call when you’re serious about buying a house”. After that I was referred to Dan. Nothing but the complete opposite of the rude lender. Dan answered every question at pretty much any time of day. Super responsive, very knowledgeable, willing to actually explain how the process worked, and would even make quick videos just to physically show me numbers. It has been a great experience and I 100% recommend Dan and Solcosta Home Loans. Because of them I just closed on my first home.</review>< GmapID>

Dan Patty has been such a pleasure to work with!!! He exceeded our expectations for assisting us in refinancing our home. From the start he was extremely responsive, happy to answer all questions thoroughly and provide quotes asked for. He continued excellent communication through the refi process and underwriting. This refi has been 10x easier than past refinances I have been through, I was pleasantly surprised the entire time. I cannot recommend Dan and his team enough. Thank you again Dan and Solcosta!< /text>

Dan Patty has been absolutely REMARKABLE!

I found Dan from my boyfriend's, sister's friends when I first started searching for a home. My boyfriend and I were looking for mobile homes and condos because we thought that was the only thing we can afford, but Dan pointed out that we can afford a single family home.

So weekend after weekend, we searched throughout the Bay Area and this week we finally closed in on our first ever house! I still can't believe it!

Dan was very thorough with his explanations, quick to respond to all of our emails and overall super helpful in helping us purchase our first home.

Thank you SO much again Dan for making our dreams come true! I already recommended you to a banker I spoke with and a few other friends, and will definitely be posting about you on social media!< /Review>

Dan Patty guided us through financing two houses and then refinancing them a year later (December 2020). His expertise and clear explanations made the process painless for us.  He was always quick to answer e-mails, phone messages and text messages and to keep us informed throughout the process. My husband and I highly recommend Solcosta Home Loans and Dan Patty!</Review>

In 2018 I made an offer to purchase my first home. There were lots of bids, and my realtor advised that I needed a competitive offer not only in price, but a quick closing as well. She recommended Dan Patty. I called and he responded immediately. After a few questions he told me that he specialized in quick closing.  This was written in the offer, (and a big part of the reason it was accepted!). Fast forward two years, and I decided to look into refinancing in order to lower my interest rate and monthly payment. I contacted Dan Patty, and after answering just a couple of questions he provided four estimates with refinance options. I shopped around for another day, but could not find a lower rate or fees,  and no one else could do a term of 28 years. The application process was very easy to complete online and I was able to submit all of the documentation through the secure website.  The entire process from my first call to Dan to closing was less than 21 days!  Dan is friendly, extremely knowledgeable and always quick to respond to any questions. It was a pleasure to have him assist in refinancing my home. I recommend Dan Patty to anyone looking for quality Mortgage Brokerage services.<//Text>

My wife and I started our home search and loan process with many questions.  We were blessed to have an outstanding realtor and an incredible mortgage broker, Dan Patty.  He made closing our loan effortless.  His level of professionalism and expertise is second to none.  No matter when we called, emailed or texted him he responded with that very pleasant and ensuring voice that anxious home buyers need to hear.   Dan always took away the anxiety and assured us that we would be okay.  We highly recommend Dan and his team.  Edward and Denise Kimble</review>

Smoothest mortgage process ever.  I'll never call anyone else but Dan. He  is the best.  This is my 4th time doing a mortgage app and Dan made it so simple.

Dan Patty is amazing and helped us out so much! We were first time homebuyers and had a lot of questions about everything. He answered every email, phone call request, and every other thing we could throw his way. I had strange hours and would reach out at odd times in the day but he always answered as soon as he could and always clarified whatever we needed to be clarified. We wouldn't have made it to our first home without Dan's patience, understanding, and constant support (along with our agent who worked alongside with Dan as a great team!). I highly recommend Dan as he knows how to get things done with speed but also quality.<//text>

I feel immensely grateful to have had Dan apart of my journey in buying my first home. He had the answers to all my questions, highly responsive, and kept me organized. Without him, I wouldn't have been able to confidently make an offer. Thank you Dan for making this process seamless and fun. I have already referred 3 of my closest friends to Dan because I am confident he can and will be a valuable key player during their home searching journey.<//Review>

Dan Patty was top class-- we could not have been more impressed. He was efficient, knowledgeable, accessible, and extremely competent. He worked so well with everyone on our team and his reputation for being the best preceded him with the realtors and the mortgage brokers. It was only 19 days from when first laid eyes on the house to when it was ours, and the speedy timeline was thanks to Dan Patty. Thank you for helping us realize our dream of buying our house! We give Dan Patty our highest recommendation.< /Text>

<Review>I was referred to Dan by a friend because I was not having luck finding a company that would take on a refi for the condominium complex I live in.  I had previously purchased this with an adjustable rate... and after 5 years it could go up.  I’ve always had the intention of refinancing just couldn’t find someone and with Covid issue, it was even harder.  Within a month, we were signed, sealed and I had extra money to do the remodel of the dreams!  Dan was great at communicating and keeping me up to date with process, what papers I needed to provide and was available many times after hours.  Just a great guy to work with and easy.  2.99% fixed 30 yr. rate.  Couldn’t be happier!  Thank you Dan!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Dan will work with you around the clock to get the best possible results. Questions and uncertainty.. He has answers and guidance to get you to the next phase. Good communication though and through.. Even better after the deal closes he is still by your side for all you needs and questions you maybe unsure of.  The business isn't anywhere else but here!</Text>

Dan made refinancing my house easy and pain free with absolutely no pressuring as seems to be common in this industry.  He got me everything I was looking for (within reason, of course) and the whole process was quick from beginning to end.  On a scale of 1 to10, there is no question that his service definitely rates a 10!<//Text>

I owe Dan a few STELLAR reviews because he’s worked with me three times between different mortgages and refinances. Dan is professional, incredibly responsive, and works at lightning speed to get his clients the best possible outcome. He has a customer for life here, and I will continue to refer anyone and everyone who’s looking to finance a new home or investment property and/ or refi.< /review>

You can’t say enough good things about Dan

He is amazing... after working with him on the purchase of my first house,

I called him for a refi, at the same time found another house which he facilitated the purchase of.... all in a month and during a pandemic....

Wow

Dan is professional, knowledge and will work with you to make things happen.

Give him a call,
You will not be disappointed!<//Text>

The legends about Dan are true, he is the man! We were referred to Dan when we were purchasing our first home. He helped us and clarified all steps along the way. He kept us up to date in the process and was super responsive to any calls/texts/e-mails. One of the best things about Dan, he was looking out for us even after our purchase. He informed us of available lower interest rates and helped us refinance at a great rate! Highly recommend using him, he was an absolute pleasure to work with!< /Text>

Our journey into buying our first home was scary and uncertain if we would be approved. I found Dan Patty on yelp back in 2017. He was very knowledgeable on everything my husband and I asked about since we knew only the basics on buying a home. Dan made it easier and helpful with his in depth knowledge. Dan was quick in communicating with us on everything and always answered our questions quickly whether we called, texted, or emailed him. We were able to close with Dan on our first home in a matter of a month. So all of October and in our home the 2nd week of November 2017. We were being evicted since owner wanted to sell, so it was either buy our own home or rent to pay for someone else's mortgage. I am so glad I found Dan Patty. He made approving to get a loan and buying a house quick and to the point.
Fast forward to July 2020
I convinced my husband we should refinance since APR rate is low and if seemed like the perfect time to do it. I contacted Dan Patty again to possibly do a refinance with him and see what he can show to us for APR rates. We were very pleased with the rate and decided to go forward with the refinancing with Dan Patty. He is still quick to answer any questions and paperwork that was needed to continue to close. We closed just this week. Overall this time around seemed just as smooth as the first time. We are so happy with our new loan and very grateful for Dan on getting our loan closed so quickly. Very much appreciate the work he did for us!</text>

When my wife and I finally decided to buy our home we were introduced to Dan, and I knew from the start that we’d found the right broker. He is efficient, responsive, and highly knowledgeable. Most importantly, he cares for his clients and it shows. He took his time to explain the process along the way, helped us through small bumps in the road, and got us to the finish line! We would gladly work with him again someday.</review>

<text>Where can I start?!?! Dan was very responsive, patient and very knowledgeable. He was available any day of the week through phone, e-mail AND text. I appreciate all the options he offered me and my partner. We had been down this path 5 years ago now and Dan informed us of many things that our previous lender never mentioned. You will definitely get the lowest rate possible, A+ service and the home of your dreams is made possible in a short closing time frame! Thanks Dan for all your hard and dedicated work, your passion for this line of work shines through!<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

We used Dan with the purchase of our home and again when we refinanced. He does an amazing job at explaining everything in simple terms to make the whole process stress free and easy to understand and is always looking for lower rates and ways for his clients to save money. We were completely satisfied with how the process was carried out for both experiences.</review>

He is knowledgable, experienced, transparent with his communication, attention to detail, customer service oriented, and the list can go on and on.  He truly cares about his clients from beginning to the end.  He makes you feel like you are important while he is juggling many clients at the same time and the same way.

When i wanted to know my options, he sat down with me and laid it all out for me. In my case, i was curious how the interest rate was effected by the size of the down payment. So we sat down in his office, and we played around with all of the numbers to find out what worked best for my family. I will definitely be recommending Dan, to anyone who asks.< /text><Rating>5</Rating>< user_name>

I am updating my review, it was a 5 star and it is staying a 5 star. I wish I could leave multiple reviews since he did my initial home purchase, and now years later my refinance.

Thanks to Daniel and his team, they worked quickly and pushed to get me in my home as soon as possible (and now refinance as seamless as possible).  I am still amazed at how easy they made this process for me! Any questions that pop in my head, I am still able to reach out to Dan and he's happy to help!

I really appreciate everything they have done for me and will definitely recommend them to everyone who needs a Mortgage Broker.<//review>

<rate>5</rate><review>Dan Patty Mortage is high quality service! As a first time homebuyer he made us feel like we were always making the best choice. He was prompt, quick to respond to questions (which I had a lot of), he wrote up estimates, sent them to realtor, explained taxes, looked into loans & programs we could've qualified for and was patient with us in our process.

We had been looking for a house for 3-4 months seriously and talked to 2-3 other brokers who either took to long to respond, did not answer my questions or just told me what they thought I needed to hear based off my income. I ended up doing my own research & found Dan on google. He had several amazing reviews. I hope this just adds to the testimate of his character of his business & integrity towards his clients.
Even after we have bought our house & coming up on tax season Dan continues to check in and send us updates.Thank you Dan for the amazing service looking forward to continuing to work with you & to send clients your way.

I am so happy we were all able to work together as a team to help you achieve your goal of homeownership. Congratulations to you my friend!!'}<//Resp><review>FIRST TIME BUYER - - To whomever is considering doing business with Mr. Dan Patty...do your self a favor and partner with him, you will not regret it! This man is on top of it! Quick responses, complete and concise answers, no BS, very knowledgeable, and very patient! Most of all, he will certainly sniff out the best possible deals for you. To other first time buyers, do yourself another favor and go with a broker, not a lender! They can typically get you much better rates than a standard lender because they have a large pool of nationwide lenders they pull from for your specific situation. Thankfully, a family member of mine steered me toward Dan because they too had a great experience with him. I was particularly impressed with how low Dan was able to get my "PMI" or Premium Mortgage Insurance. This is typically something you pay if you are putting less than 20% down and the fee eventually goes away. Some PMI fees can be hundreds of dollars if you go with a lender or just get a bad deal. Dan was able to get mine down to just 30 something bucks. Thanks to Dan, I was able to afford more house as a single man than I ever could have imagined when I first set out looking for homes. Hell, this man even promptly returned my message when he was on vacation. He is very technology savvy and is very approachable. Like most things, the hardest part of the process for me was just taking that first step and getting the ball rolling on getting pre-approved for a loan amount. He makes it easy to get started and what he sends you along the way is not overwhelming, but rather very helpful and simple. The home buying process can be inherently stressful, but Dan mitigates that feeling of stress by keeping it simple, professional, and smooth. He didn't know my realtor at all and I received several compliments from my realtor about Dan and how well they worked together. Go with Dan!<//review></record>

Dan was amazing! Trusting someone with your life savings is hard but he made everything so easy for my husband and i as first time buyers. He’s was thorough from beginning to end and we closed in like 2 weeks! Can’t emphasize enough how good he is at what he does, he made us feel secure and also never pushed us to do anything we weren’t ok with. For anyone looking to buy a home soon or in the near future es definitely the guy you need!
Thanks Dan!</text>

< Review>
We financed, then refinanced a home with Dan Patty. He walked us through everything, was patient with our questions and everything went well — both times. The initial purchase of the home had a short closing period because of a situation with the seller, and he was able to get everything done in an expedited manner. When we did our refinance, we thought about going with one of the online services, but decided we wanted to work with someone we knew, and though it cost a little more, I was happy to keep that money in Vallejo.<//Review>

<Review>My wife and I had the privilege of refinancing our home loan with Dan, but the thing that stood out the most to us was Dan's persistence.  We worked with Dan starting almost two years ago to pre-qualify and map out a plan to re-enter home ownership after suffering a foreclosure (business choice) during the market crash in 2008.  Dan helped us identify areas we could improve on, and advised us of what people in our situation would have to overcome.  We stuck to the plan and were able to get pre-qualified very quickly through Dan.

We kept our eyes on the market, thought about pulling the trigger a couple of times on an offer, but then had the opportunity to purchase our family home from my parents if we could wait a few years.  We told Dan of the plan and he never once seemed discouraged to have worked on our behalf without a deal being done.  He actually helped us identify favorable opportunities that exist when purchasing directly from family (no need for a realtor, possibility of a gift of equity, inheriting the original property taxes, etc.).

As we worked towards the goal of buying our family home Dan continued to work with us and was able to offer us a reasonable loan at the time we were ready to purchase, however after shopping around, specifically through Costco's mortgage program, we were able to get a more favorable loan.  Having developed a friendship with Dan through the years I was nervous about breaking the news to him that all of his work on behalf of my family was not going to conclude with a mortgage deal, but after breaking the news to Dan he said "Mike I completely understand, this is business and you have to do what's best for your family.  This is the best I can do with the options available to me, so please think of me in the future if you are ever in the market again."

Who the hell has that understanding and long term focus?  Dan.

Fast forward to six months after we purchased our family home with the Costco loan and I get an email from Dan explaining that he is his own boss now and that with that authority and an even lower interest rate than was available at the time of our purchase that he believed he could refinance our loan and save us money.

This dude!

Seriously, after working for years and getting nothing from us, he sought us out and offered to help us.  We took him up on the offer and just as he had predicted, Dan was able to shave a full percentage point off of our APR and close to $500 on our monthly bill.

We can't thank Dan enough for his amazing persistence, professionalism, and awareness of client's needs.  We will always shop Dan first, and we strongly encourage anyone in the market to do the same.  Dan Patty walks the walk in an industry known for being full of talkers.<//Review><user_id>114796471539334312173<//user_id><Date>1565197304055</Date>< Rate>

<text>Dan is the man! He is super informative and walked me through the entire loan process. He made himself available whenever I had a question (I had a ton!) and always made sure I understood everything before moving me along the process. I trust that Dan is always getting me the best deal and looking out for my interest. Dan will be the first person I reach out to if I ever need another loan again.</text>< response>

People’s home equity has been so wonderful to us, and helped us move into our new home. Sean, Sherry and Annette helped us. My husband was deployed during our move into our first home and it was so stressful for me, but somehow they made it manageable. People’s home equity cares about people and goes the extra mile. If I were to recommend anyone, it would be them. No questions asked!< /review>

<Review>We give our HIGHEST recommendation to Dan Patty and the Patty Team (especially Charles!)!  As first time homebuyers, we had a million questions about the home buying process, and needed someone who could communicate clearly, be extremely patient, and always act in our best interest.  Also, in this competitive market, we could only use the best of the best if we wanted our offer to be accepted and successfully close in a reasonable amount of time.  Thankfully for us, Dan surpassed ALL of our expectations!  He was there for us every step of the way - starting when we had no idea what homes we could put offers on, all the way up until signing our final paperwork with us!  If you want to have some peace of mind during the stress of buying a home, then Dan is the way to go! He lives up to every positive review! THANK YOU x a million DAN!!!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Rating>

"Bottom of the barrel healthcare." I was assigned this clinic as my PCP from my medical insurance provider. They are the absolute worst I have ever been to. I've been here many times and have only seen the primary doctor once. I've gone without my medications because the doctors office doesn't respond to the pharmacy requesting permission for refills on my medication. When I call them, most of the time I'm on the phone for what it seems like forever for them to pick up the phone. Sometimes they don't even pick up. The nurse practitioner was completely rude and never seems to feel any empathy for her patients. It feels as if you are just another annoyance to her. The one thing I will give praise to in regards to this office is the front door. It's clearly the only thing in this place that actually does its job correctly.</Text>

<review>If I could I will give this place ZERO. There front desk MA Melissa is horrible. She does not have any empathy for the patients.  I was reading the reviews that people have given about the MA'S that how horrible they are but i guess MANAGEMENT is sleeping. If wonder if there is any management. I feel bad for the M.D. who has to work with such a terrible staff. No wonder he is always in different clinics as he  might not have enough patients to attend in the clinic due to HORRIBLE staff.</review><user_name>Prabhjot Kaur< /user_name><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x8090156eb7753dab:0xf27dfc204f19e1a3<//gmapID><Rate>1< /Rate><UserId.>116002296843139564161< /UserId.>< Pics>

Absolutely Lathrop Urgent Care now that Dr “Raj” Maheshwari took over.  His entire office staff including their office Manager Melisa is ALWAYS so helpful and on top of things.  My entire family from ages 8 to 46 all use the Doctor for Primary Care, Pediatric Care and Urgent Care.  We have been going here for almost 5-6 years now. TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS DOCTOR!!!!< /Review>

Lathrop Urgent Care and Main Street Urgent Care is the best. Dr Raj is so helpful, understanding, kind, and caring doctor. Melissa is the best manager anyone can ask for.She is always listening and helpful and understanding. The staff is very helpful and understanding. I was a medical assistant extern in both sites and the experience was amazing. Without Melissa and Dr Raj I would not have been where I am. The staff is amazing. Crystal, Jessie, Gurbinder, Shervante Melissa, Dr Raj is amazing. Keep up the good work. Thank you for having me Dr Raj and Melissa at your clinic. May god continue to bless you all and I recommend anyone looking for a great docor go to Lathrop or Main Street Urgent Care. Dr Raj is the best doctor.< /Review>

This is one of the best urgent cares i have been too on the west coast. The Doctor was really easy to talk to and was very caring an helpful. I will definitely be going back, and referring my friends & family.

If I could put 0 stars O would.  Receptionist gave me a hard time during my initial call to inquire about services.  Then she told me that they stopped taking patients at 4:00 but close at 4:30.  I pulled into the parking lot and was in the door by 4:04, the rceptionist said that the doctor left...how?  That was enough for me.<//review>

<review>I would really like to know who and what they provide medical services for.  They have a very disinterested staff.  I have no idea what the Docs are like since I can't get past the front desk.  I live very near and am dissappointed in their lack of concern for health issues  and problems people have.   I guess there is no such thing as a caring medical person....< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>My experience was very frustrating to say the least. I signed in at the front at 10:45am. I was coming in to get a DOT Physical. When I asked how much it was, one of them said she was just training, and she turned away and went back to what she was doing. So I sat down and waited for 2 hrs. When I got there, there were only 2 people in the waiting area. After 2 hours of waiting, finally a staff girl took me back and did the tests she could do (she seemed incompetent herself. Some else had to retake my blood pressure)  , then left me one of the patient rooms for almost 45 minutes waiting for the doctor (apparently there was only one doctor). No one came to check on me, or let me know it might be a while before the doctor sees me. This Urgent Care is poorly managed and lacks in customer service.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<review>This is by far the WORST urgent care office ever!!  Unfortunately I have been in this office many times in the past couple years.  For a short time it was my primary care facility.  The doctors are always nice and helpful but the front office is horrible.  They are slow, have horrible manners and it's impossible to get any assistance from them.  I would say 80% of the time they don't call in your prescriptions promptly and give a ton of attitude when you call in looking to see why it has not been called to the pharmacy yet.

Today was the final straw.  I walked in for back pain and had to take time off of work to do so.  When I arrived I was told there was a 30-45 minute wait time so I had to call my boss to make sure it would be ok for me to be away from work for an extended amount of time.  Now I understand that things can happen and that sometimes appointments can take longer than expected, but after a hour and fifteen minute wait I was called up to the front to fill out new patient paperwork since they apparently have a new billing service.  I questioned why I had been waiting so long and was told that there are many other patients in from of me and that there also are APPOINTMENTS in front of me.  I had not been advised that this office took appointments so I questioned why this was not explained to me and if I was going to have to wait for another hour or not.  The question I then received from the girl at the front counter in a very sarcastic tone was.. "Well do you have an appointment?"  I answered "NO, you know that." She then replied "Well then I can't tell you how long it will be."  This is the same person that quoted 30-45 minutes when I first arrived.  I continued to explain my work situation and the final response from the front counter was "Do you want to see the physician or not?"  REALLY!!!  Nice attitude to have with your customers.  How about treating patients like they deserve to be treated, with respect.  Needless to say I left the office immediately and will never go back there again.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Resp>None</Resp><Rate>1</Rate><Text>Well for start I do not know why they bother to post hours of operation, because they do not follow them the Dr can stop seeing patients at any time for what ever reason.  Second this online appointment system dose not work , I made the mistake of doing that. It's really sad that someone who was suffering and could not get in to there primary MD could not even be seen at a urgent care. I hope no one bothers going here just a waste of time.</Text><Name>Shannon Tucker</Name><date>1488417943438< /date>< UserId.>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE  if you are very  sick don’t ever think about to go to this so called URGENT CARE,  I did it because it was an emergency for me I was very sick with the flu, my symptoms were very irregular so I got scared and I couldn’t  make an appointment with my regular physician, so I walk in to this  care, I found out that I got pneumonia, I got a shot , antibiotics, and a cough syrup,  so eventually I round out of cough syrup, it work very good for me  the problem was when I call for refill they denied  my request, the so call “doctor on duty”  may review request after hours so if this is a  life threat who care right!  They follow their protocol; patients,  forget it, their necessities are not important they have to finish.
I call so many times times first pleading for a refill after three days they deny complete the medication so I’m being cough for almost 6 days now and using DM Robutissin the staff in this office is very incompetent and rude they practically mocking you in the phone they are sarcastic and unprofessional but went you need an appointment they the first thing is how much they are going to charge, just business, as any profitable regular business.  This group of unprofessional employees doesn’t care about your health it should be call NO URGENT CARE / CHARGE.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x8090156eb7753dab:0xf27dfc204f19e1a3<//GmapID></record>

<review>Worst urgent Care I have ever been to, drove about 30min to get here with my hurt daughter only to be told I have to be an existing patient to be seen (makes no sense).

<Text>The wait time is unbelievable most of the time, even to get a shot that takes 3 minutes. it would be nice for me and everyone waiting to get me in and out so theres a seat to sit in and i can get on my way. 3 hours for a shot every week is alot of time lost. On the plus side though, david really knows what he is doing. So grateful i found that doctor. The many doctors i have seen in my life since the marine corps and all my injurys as a result of service, dont have a logicle brain. THANKS DAVID.< /Text><GmapID>0x8090156eb7753dab:0xf27dfc204f19e1a3</GmapID><rate>5< /rate>< Time>

<text>I wish I could give 0 stars this place is so bad and dirty It looks like the equipment hasn’t been updated sense the 70s. The doctor doesn’t care about what you have to say at all. I had to wait in the room for almost an hour to be seen. The patients bed had huge holes in it, super uncomfortable stay away from this place.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>I'm not sure what's going on with this place. Wrong dates are given for appointments or they call you the same to cancel your appointment. Sometimes waiting 2weeks making it 3 weeks when caceld It's  unacceptable time to find new doc. It's sad because I like my doc<//Text>< Pictures>

The menu has been enhanced and the favorites are still on the menu. Fun quick place to dine with family looking for pancakes and breakfast food. Excellent food and service. Had the country fried steak and eggs. Among the best I've had. Restaurant was busy but only waited for about 5-10 minutes. Definitely will be going back.<//Text>

<text>Tres leche pancakes.  Pure diabetes. My co-worker Hector B ordered. And the Philly cheese sub was mine. It doesn't hurt to have a cheat day here or there. I didn't get greasy from nor onion rings,  instead I got house potatoes. Not sure if the name but it was healthier.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Clean and organized IHOP. The only issue I had was the fact that our waitress went on a break and never said anything. Totally unprofessional! But I guess finding good worker's is hard these day's.</review>

<text>My favorite place for breakfast. Love their breakfast sampler, it has two eggs, two bacon, two sausage, two ham, two fluffy pancakes and golden hash browns. I ordered take out, it's put in a two layers container, pancakes in top level, the meat and on the bottom. Love their take out pack.
We had tried the rooty tooty fresh n fruity pancakes many times, we tried it with peach topping and blueberries topping, both are delicious, but the portion is too big, after taking in the fluffy 4 pancakes, you are basically too full to eat the other stuffs.</text><Resp>None<//Resp><Date>1516685170655<//Date><userid>105682585424358752913<//userid><gmap_id>0x808fbe4bff79a7f9:0x1c63d4c2d9b3cd2e<//gmap_id>< rate>

Nice staff and seated quickly.
Order came quickly and waiter asked before food arrived if we wanted hot syrup and more napkins, without us having to ask.
Food was good and coffee was plentiful.
Not too busy for a saturday afternoon, but then again the food is good but not Great.< /review>

Always a great experience at this location. Best time of day is late afternoon for quieter dining experience. Most of the staff are very friendly. Tables are always clean, and location us well-maintained. Parking can be tight right outside however there is plenty of parking in the main lot.<//review>

Great place for a good selection of food and big servings.
Quick service most days but Sunday mornings are usually a long wait so be prepared.

It's an ihop so nothing special about the food. However the service was great! Brought my toddler for funny face pancakes and of course there was a spill. Margarit our server was prompt and attentive and made it a way less stressful instance than it could have been. Will definitely return when I'm not feeling cooking pancakes at home again.< /Text>

We had the create tour own melt, the western burger, and shared the cannoli pancakes (yum)

Do recommend this location to everyone. Best IHOP experience I've had in a long time and super stoked it's my local IHOP (just moved here) because  I plan to return often.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Unless you are going for the promo, do not go in late in the day after a promo. IHOP was offering a free stack of pancakes today if you donated to a charity. 7am-7pm on all the promotions. This location apparently ended theirs at 2pm. Okay, no biggie. I missed out. Giant posters offering a limited time all you can eat pancakes with the purchase of an omelette. Well that sounds like a great deal. I order the steak omelette. It came out fairly quick and tasted great to me.
The problem is the staff after a promotion. They probably brought more staff in to handle the promo but everyone was beleaguered. My server more so than others. Appeared to rush my initial order and came with my check after I had finished my omelette and pancakes. I had to request more pancakes which surprised him but he agreed to get me another 2. It took awhile which I could understand. It came out great. But that was it. My server did not seem to come down my aisle again or check up on me. Did not get a refill on water once or offered any more of the unlimited pancakes. He unfortunately did not identify himself, turned quickly when I tried to look at his name tag, and was not the server listed on my check.

Can’t say I blame the staff but do yourself a favor and not go in after a promo. The food was still good but everyone looked battle weary and customer service seemed to suffer.< /text>

Recently me and my grandmother decided to go back to this IHOP after a few months of not going. They had bad habit of making her breakfast on the cool/cold side by leaving it waiting to be brought. This time was even worse. Except for her tea being hot and her pancakes being warm, her food was already cooled when served with the bacon and eggs.
Even mine  the special cheesecake french toast sausage & eggs combo was off. While the french toast was hot, it barely had the cheesecake on it making me ask if order was correct. They decided not to put much apparently. Then had cold sausage and warm enough hash brown/eggs which needed to be eaten fast to make it passable.
We gave this place many chances in the past and they use to be more efficient at serving the food, now they are not. Just save $ and go to BK or McDonalds nearby for breakfast since the food is actually hot.</Text>

Food was good. Service sucked. So that's the reason for 2 stars. If they paid attention to the customer more. Then maybe I'd make it 5 stars.<//review>

They have made a real effort at making it a respectable place.
The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  Rarely do you need to wait for something.
The food all tastes good and is a reasonable value for the money.</review>

This is the best IHOP that I’ve ever visited. My waitress, I think ‘Carmine’, was obviously a master of the industry. I think it would benefit the company greatly to invest in better coffee, however. Also, bring back flavored coffee creamer!</review>

<Text>Not all IHOPs are created equal, but this IHOP is definitely liked by my family. Comfortable location with a lot of parking around. Waiters are always pleasant and helpful to us. Comfortable and even little cozy. Food is good. Apparently, you shouldn't expect a Michelin star caviar stuff, but among other IHOPs this is one of those, where I like the food. Put it simply,  my wife, toddler, and I have very pleasant pancake time here. And we're planning to keep enjoying this place.<//Text><Rate>5<//Rate><gmap_id>0x808fbe4bff79a7f9:0x1c63d4c2d9b3cd2e< /gmap_id>< resp>

Wasn't sure what to expect, but basically a fast food restaurant. Was served by a lovely lady who actually gave me what I ordered, but entered it differently and I got more for the same so can't complain! But as with any fast food place, food is quick but a little lacking in taste and goes straight to the waist!</Review>

My visit was in the evening and it wasn't super busy but, there were several tables occupied. I wish I caught the name of the host because, he was a one man band and did an outstanding job. Aside from actually cooking the food, he did everything else and had 10 star organizational and time management skills. I got 3 meals to go and after all was said and done,I tipped him 20 dollars. I'm wondering now if I shortchanged him though because, he represented everything that excellent customer service is about. My thanks to him and hope I see him again on my next visit.
Also, the food was very good as well< /text>

This IHOP is very very clean. The staff is men and women. To get here look for the blue roof or come into the plaza it's across Ross store. The food was super yummy. I informed the places was renovated 5yrs ago and to see the high traffic in here now the place is very nice and clean.</Review>

This place is neat and clean and less crowded. The service is excellent. The food quality and quantity are good. I am not going to any other IHOP after visiting this.<//review>

So far so good.. It's Sunday and it is packed with hungry people! However they are handling the crowd rather quickly. More to come waiting on my Build your own brkfst.< /review>

<review>Very bad experience with to go orders here. Person who answered the phone was rude, gave me the wrong food and over charged me. When I called to complain, the same person answered the phone and dismissed me. This is the second time this has messed up my order, will never go back.<//review>< UserId.>

The food is ok. IHOP is meant for the pancakes and i would just stick to ordering that. Upon leaving there was a 💩 by the front door. However, employee's were vwry quick amin fixing the matter.< /review>

As with most IHOPs, expect a wait before being seated if you're going on the weekend.</text>< pics>

I became a regular here that they know where I like to sit and pretty much what I order. The service is very nice and the waitress are very kind even the host. Food is always great very consistent as well. Which is what I like. It's a lot better than the one in Union City incase you want to compare and it's more family friendly than the one in Union City. Mornings are always best for me to come during the week not as crowded but hopefully this review doesn't get it to crowed lol kidding. Sundays are always crowed so it says a lot of this place lots of family's come here. So what do I order? Well, over easy eggs pancakes and sausages everyone always the same not like other es where at times its over cooked its old or pancakes take like yesterday's pancakes as for here in newark it's awesome!< /Text>
