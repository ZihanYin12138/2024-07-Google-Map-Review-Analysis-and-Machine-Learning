I did my research and decided this studio was one i wanted to join. I have asthma, and typically hotter yoga classes are tough for me. I explained my situation to the owner and she allowed me to try a couple classes to see how it went. The class was so incredible. Joining this studio and would recommend to anyone. 🙏🏼</review>< Pictures>

Friendly staff and calm environment. The showers, cubbies and dressing rooms are well kept. I love that they have a hydration station and you can rent a mat for $5 if you forget yours (first time its free!). I also really enjoy the fact that they provide yoga blocks if you need them at no additional cost. I absolutely love this place! 💛</text>

I've been going to Solfire since it opened almost 5 years ago and I cannot say enough about how amazing this studio is. Everyone there is warm, friendly, compassionate and understanding. Not to mention they have some of the best instructors teaching there!< /Text>

This is my favorite local yoga studio. The environment is very chill, grounded and the instructors are supportive. There are other yoga studios in Midtown that feel pretentious, cult-y...this is not one of those studios. I love this place.

For more rigorous classes, choose these instructors: Blake, Jany, Rachel, Janna, Evey and Stephanie.
For more strength building, choose these instructors: Jamie, Taylor, Ellen and Amanda.

Every instructor is unique...some classes I will burn 300 calories, others I only burn 150. Keep that in mind...every class is different, week to week!

I love this place so much.< /review>

The restorative classes are the best I've experienced!  Teachers are calming and kind, and I always leave feeling a sense of peace and very, very relaxed.  The studio is very welcoming but it is a bit on the warmer side.

My favorite class and teacher is Vin on Tuesday evenings.  Blake not only adds knowledge and instruction but soulfulness and laughter to his classes.  I'm hooked!</Review>

I was in a moderate class with some seriously talented yogis, and I still felt welcomed and encouraged despite being a bit rusty and out of my practice, with a shoulder cuff injury, nonetheless. I can't believe it took me so long to make it to Solfire. I will be back with regularity.<//Review>< pictures>

I love everything about Solfire- the space, the art, the people, the classes, the workshops, the merchandise, and the discounts for teachers and public servants. I also like that they offer different types of classes in the Harmony studio. I first visited Solfire to check out a Kundalini class and was intrigued by the cool vibe in the main studio. I never thought I would practice hot yoga again, but now I’m hooked. I especially love 60 minute classes.< /text>

It’s wonderful. The staff, teachers, and classes are awesome. I had never done yoga in a guided class before. So, naturally, I was nervous. I didn’t think I’d literally be able to handle the heat (of their Vinyasa classes) or keep up with the double zeros. They make you feel comfortable. They also challenge you but reiterate that it’s about going at your own pace. I was initially wary too since I have a permanent hip injury. The teachers are more than happy to provide modifications if need be. I like that they practice what they preach. If you’re wary, like I was, start with their $30 for 30 days (keep in mind it’s consecutive). They have lots of classes to choose from, hot and regular. I am no longer wary and now an unlimited monthly member! Not only will you make Yoga practice a part of your daily routine but also your lifestyle. Granted, it’s an expensive hobby but it’s definitely worth it for your mental and physical health. There are few things in life that give you what you truly need; a healthy body (and heart) and happy mind. And I’d recommend Solfire yoga as one of the few.</Text>

Solfire truly is a place of inclusivity for everybody and every body. I've practiced at the studio for two years and would never want to take class anywhere else. It's not just the yoga, it's our wonderful and diverse community. We welcome, support, and most importantly celebrate each other. Come flow with us!</review>

I like the fact your community offers classes like Kundalini Yoga, Yin, and Nidra. I find those classes more difficult to access in other studios in Sacramento.  These classes offer great variety for people who get stuck in energy patterns and who are overly structured. I also like that your studio has a private meditation room with bowls and oracle cards. I do not know of any other studio that has that. The quotes that you leave on our shoes are also a great idea because it is an opportunity for people to leave the class with the sense of accomplishment and good luck. The Karma yoga (selfless service volunteering) is also a great system for people who are willing and capable to contribute to the community with the best of their abilities.All in all, solfire yoga is a great place to practice yogic techniques and are open to people who face difficulties with life.< /review>

This location, rightly so, has such kind staff, an inviting environment, and obviously quality products. Whoever was responsible for the design of the place, architecture, floor layout, and overall aesthetic deserves praise; the look they preach is evident here.</review>

<review>The Lulu staff at this location are amazing! Samira guided me and was extremely helpful with helping me address a miscommunication with the seamstreess involving $400 worth of mens pants. She helped me from start to finish and was educated on the company and provided me with a great customer service that reflected the brands care and great customer service . My favorite location for this reason!</review>< pics>

<Review>Super convenient location in fashion Island, I found everything I needed quite easily. The staff are friendly and very helpful when assisting you to change rooms and finding alternate sizes.  Definitely a great gift idea for any woman in your life☺️☺️ if you are planning to get a gift card make sure you are laying out enough money for a few purchases, llulu is pricey!!</Review>< userid>

Great service and quality products. The Only bad thing was when I had a pair of pants hemmed, I wasn’t happy with the result. One pant leg is an obvious 1/2 inch shorter than the other... You would think that the quality would be carried over into the tailoring process as well. I love the location and set up of the store as well. They also let us bring our dog in.</Text>

Well appointed store. Bought a pant and hemming was done in less than an hour. Other stores won’t do it on site and send it out. So if you are in a rush to get an item to your size this is the store.</Text>

Horrible experience I bought two sets of Pants and gave for hamming. It was supposed to be shipped to my home and It never happened. The manager at this location told me that they have shipped to us and they are not responsible for if it lost by carrier. They never gave me tracking number too . Now we have to file dispute with credit card company for not delivering the order  Don't leave the items with for hamming since you may lose your items in shipping due to their careless mistake<//Review>

I've been to quite a few of the different lululemon stores and I have always been treated with politeness, knowledge of the products and I feel very well taken care of while I'll shopping in any of the stores.  I feel very at home at the Newport Beach store...its close to my home and they are cheerful and knowledgeable.  PLUS, the lululemon products are very well made and always changing...I LOVE my total experience when I'm shopping there and know l'm getting a top of the line product!  Thank you<//text>

<review>The lululemon, Canadian sports apparel store, has moved to a new location at Fashion Island on December 5th, 2017.  Very nice new store with great customer service.  Men's, kid's and women's apparel are located in the same shop. Their apparel is well made, but I find their selection boring and too expensive for my taste.  Their Canadian sports apparel just isn't for me, but Macy's is located across from their store.  Macy's has more selection of sports wear at a much more affordable price. lululemon had a sign for a juice bar, but I didn't see one open while enjoying their new shop.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>The people who work here are as ridiculous as the prices. The two week return policy is a joke. The "help" was extremely rude when I brought a gift back after two weeks, and might as well have told me to never come back. Fine by me. I don't recommend this store to anyone. You can get better apparel from TJ Max, for a quarter of the price. Do yourself a favor, avoid this store.< /review>< rating>

Don't ever try to call this store, they never and I mean NEVER answer the phone. The overall tone of the store has young twenty somethings with the most ridiculous snotty attitude that act extremely put out if you ask anything. There is one extremely rude girl who refers to everyone as "sweetie" in the most condescending tone. You don't refer to a woman in her 40's as sweetie and again, in a "you're putting me out what do you want" tone. I'm not sure why the manager of this store thinks the type of customer service is remotely acceptable. I routinely shop at Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, etc and never once have I had a salesperson refer to me a sweetie. WIth that said, there are two great sales people in the store Margo and Emily (the one who as worked for LLL for several years)..these two are the ONLY reason I will continue to walk into the store and will only do so when they are working.< /Review>

Fast, professional, and friendly! Jared came to my campsite to help me with an accidental lockout and got me into my vehicle intact, without a tow. Can’t recommend enough! A joy to work with.</text>

Kevin was our hero!  Very professional, knowledgeable of his profession, and friendly.  My motorhome was stuck in a muddy field---(don't ask how or why I was there🙄)---, but Kevin had no trouble getting it out in short order.  The price was super reasonable.  Highly recommend this company!<//review>

My opinion doesn't mean much because my car was impounded. I do have to note their coolness when they let me stay another night without charge because I had already paid a night.</Text>

My van broke down in Bodega. These guys came and picked up me, my dog and my van, on Saturday Jan 2, replaced my alternator and battery when everyone one else in the santa rosa area was closed. You saved my butt big-time, thanks again guys.<//review>

I was lucky to have AAA send this business my way. Fully expecting an expensive auto shop bill, the tow truck operator not only was pleasant and arrived promptly but was able to fix the vehicle issue on site, preventing me from needing the tow to a shop. The tow operator actually saved me money! I am grateful to have been helped by Occidental Towing. Highly recommended!</Review>

We needed a flat bed to move our rig to the nearest auto shop and because it was such a short distance they gave us a break on the price! Very professional, would use them again in a heary beat! Very fast as well they told us 30 mins guy got there in 15! So if ya ever in need of a tow in the area Occidental is where its at!</Text>< pictures>

The most wonderful and kind service, even at 1am. Even at such a late hour, the man that helped me was patient and considerate. Wish I could give them 10 stars.</text>

<review>I just had a great experience with someone from Occidental Towing, I think his name badge said JC. Got my first flat on a new (to me) car and it turns out the lug nuts have some kind of special custom lock I did not know about. He stopped to help without me even being on his schedule and did all he could do in a highly unusual situation, offering all kinds of advice on how to move forward. Thank you Occidental Towing!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x8084246e5b82c355:0x3c2702881d3eb9f4< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Occidental Towing is SO fantastic. We are from out of town, we were hit in our rental car and had zero cell service. Terry, from OT came to pick us up. He kindly gave us a ride back to their yard which is so nice. It's tucked away, clean, and very welcoming. Jerry, the owner, came out to talk with us as my husband dealt with the rental car company. He offered to take us to breakfast or anything else we needed . After many issues with our rental company, Jerry personally offered to take us out to the Santa Rosa airport (a 45 minute round trip for him.) He even let me hold his puppy, Chew Chew, on the way.  He even gave us a tour of the town. The while staff was kind and patient with us as we worked everything out. I would HIGHLY recommend using Occidental Towing. Very professional, friendly, and knowledgable. Thank you for saving us OT!</Review></record></dataset><record>

We lost our key in the ocean at Schoolhouse Beach, Bodega Bay. We called AAA and they sent out Occidental Towing.  Danny was amazing and got our truck unlocked immediately. Then he went above and beyond and helped us contact a locksmith company that agreed to come out (we had tried calling ourselves but kept getting turned down since it was a Sunday after 6pm). We are from AZ so hopefully we won't need their services again, but highly recommend them.< /text>

I had a 20 foot steel storage container that was in the flood of the Russian River in 2019.  It floated over a 7 foot deer fence and landed in the woods on adjacent property.  It was leaning heavily sitting on some downed trees on a rising hillside.  I cleared a path through the woods but was apprehensive on what kind of costs and time it would take to pull this thing out.  The son of the original owner of Occidental came out as I asked for someone with real experience doing this kind of thing.  He was amazing how skilled and quick he was in pulling that 5000 lb container out of the woods and placing back where it belonged.  I would recommend these guys for anything difficult and different.  They aren't into making a big job of something to charge you more and they really, really know what they are doing!</review>

<review>We were towed from Guerneville to Santa Rosa for roughly $180. The driver was very friendly but NOT knowledgeable about a Prius (hybrid). The problem was a dead battery and we didn’t need to be towed... just jumped. I blame the company for not properly training their employees. So $180. for the towing & $150. to do the diagnostics at Toyota was a waste. The driver did not know where the battery was or how to connect once he found it. Luckily he didn’t ruin our car because of non training. Beware....$180. for such poor service gets a bad review...you supposedly offer a service???PROVIDE IT!!<//review><user>107467703680146413470</user><username>Patti Green</username><gmap_id>0x8084246e5b82c355:0x3c2702881d3eb9f4<//gmap_id>< resp>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Really awful service. Was setup with Occidental Towing through my auto insurance; rescheduled a next-day AM pickup with their office over the phone. Driver showed up 2 hours early for scheduled pickup, blamed me when I called them at the designated time, yelling and shouting over the phone, then refused to pick me up. Left me high and dry.

Rude & unprofessional. Especially disconcerting considering they are in a business focused on helping out people who are in troubled spots.</review>< Pics>

We called our AAA roadside service and they sent Occidental Towing Service to assist us. They arrived promptly and to our pleasant surprise the driver was a petite little "dinamo"
Dressed in pink. She was astonishingly mechanicaly knowledgeable and adept at finding and fixing our problem.
Kudos to Occidental Towing for hiring competent, capable women.
Oh, and if you don't have AAA roadside assistance you should.</review>

I was on Hwy 12 heading out of Santa Rosa. After Fulton Road where two lanes become one, the Occidental tow truck behind me tried to force in front of me and pushed me into the oncoming traffic lane. It then tail gated me and ran a red light to stay on my tail.<//text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Date>1615344705232</Date><review>I went here to sell 2 brand new plush dolls, still in their boxes and a brand new hip carrier, an infant tub and a toy scale.  They didn't accept the tub, because they already had too many and said that they didn't need more tubs and they declined the toy scale because they didn't know what it was.  For the other 3 items, the lady offered me $12 in store credit and invited me to look around.  The place was pretty big, but it was very messy. The clutter deterred me from even wanting to shop there.  I asked for cash instead and I got $10.  The lady was nice and apologized for not taking the tub, but it seemed like she just came up with a random amount for the brand new items I basically gave them.  If the store were more organized, I might've enjoyed my experience and maybe my $12 in credit would have been worth it.  Next time, I'm going somewhere else.<//review></record></dataset><record>

carseats. Then the person calls to ask and the want the model number to look on the web. Then ask more for a used item than you can go buy new. Ridiculous.  Never shop here they are disgusting< /review>< pics>

Really nicely organized, clean, family run shop with tons of selection of children's resale items. I was in town and swept up a bunch of high end items (Nike, Baby Gap) for a like 80% what you'd expect to pay. The staff was so friendly and sweet, I'll be back for sure!< /Text>

The couple who owns this shop are so kind and helpful! I felt completely comfortable in their presence. The store is nice and clean. The items for sale were all in good condition. As far as purchasing children's clothing, furniture, and/or toys 2nd hand, this is the type of place you want to be at. The items are gently used and in great condition. Everything is so cute you're bound to find something you'll love!<//text>

Although the time I went here when it was open  the owner was very friendly. Customer service at its finest. She definitely cares about the kids not just making money.  I was helped all the way back to my car. Will definitely be coming back.

review of today's visit: There's a guy who works here also that I met a different trip and would not like to go here unless the lady is helping me. He isn't friendly. Beware they don't pay cash for toys or car seats. Only store credit. Assume this or else you will be shocked at being asked you're not going to look around before I give you STORE CREDIT?</Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I love this place! First of all this is a family ran bussiness by a husband and wife who are so nice so friendly you find yourself wanting to talk to them all day! They are bussiness minded people who truly give more then they take. Ive been coming here for 2 years already and every time my little one out grows her size i find myself excitedly packing up the old clothes to see what i can trade them for. They buy all day long pretty much their store hours just dont get there right before closing and you will be fine. I usually buy a few clothes, let the kid pick a toy then get a half cash half store credit offer that is usually worth it. They carry everything baby and kids and have a really good selection of clothes and shoes. Ive gotten like 5 pairs of converse all for $6.99-$10.99 and they usually go for $20-$50 bucks.<//Text>< Pics>

Wonderful service and very well stocked with everything we could possibly need for our baby. Very low prices and kind owners that make shopping there a welcoming and enjoyable experience. After my second time returning, my family and I have decided this will be our  go-to shop-- especially for baby clothes!  :) recommend checking this store out if you haven't.</text>

< Review>
Bought some stuff for my kids here. Not recommending for you to sell stuff here because they dont give you cash, only store credit so better to sell it on your own or if you dont mind selling it to them and get store credit its fine too. They do have some but not so much.<//Review>

I usually love this place but today we went in and there was a man there usually there is a nice lady that helps us out
My husband and I went in looking for a jogging stroller that they had for $65 my husband talk to him and had agreed upon a price of $45 because something was wrong with a tier so my husband went to check if he could fix such problem and saw that he could and when the man saw that he could fix it he told us it's not $45 anymore it's now $69 but how if we had already said and agreed to the price of $45 and not just that but there was a sign saying all clothes was 50% off but come to find out that in fact was not true and it would only be 50% off if you paid in cash not card another thing that was not mention so in all if I do go back it would only be when the lady is there that man gives the store a bad look and makes it feel like he's doing something shady.<//review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) How can I not recommend this store to you, I love it because for 6 years I have been going to buy clothes for my child, they sell clothes from 0 months to 14 years old, you have many good things, beautiful and cheap and also they also change your clothes. You take them but it is in good condition so that they can give you credit for your clothes, money, nothing, only credit for what they change, go well, I recommend it with your eyes closed. It is very well located in Chula Vista. Main and broadway or in facebook also any question if you like send me a message

<Text>This winery was amazing and had a great selection of wine to taste.  We were able to get there late and the lady who helped us made sure we were comfortable and enjoying our wines. She let us sample a wine that we ended up purchasing, my husband is not a wine drinker but she was able to find something he fell in love with! Great experience!</Text>< pictures>

I have visited a couple of times since it is always such a nice place to visit and not far from home. Just wish they offered more affordable options for wine memberships. $1,100 a year as the cheapest option is a bit steep for a wine novice.<//Review>< pics>

We stumbled across this lovely gem. If you are a fan of dry wines this place is for you. It is $25.00 to do a wine tasting of 5 wines. The ambiance here is perfect. The Chardonnay is my favorite but they also have really good Petite Syrah. They have clean restrooms. As far as food goes, they chips and roasted almonds for purchase if you want a Scooby snack.</review>

Our first wine tasting and a memorable one. John was amazing and made our experience fun and educational. We sat on the patio, taking in the beautiful weather and great tasting wine. We left with a few great bottles and will definitely visit again. If John is there, ask for him. He took our experience to the next level.</Review>

<text>We started off at Starmont and we couldn't think of a better place to start! The ambiance was excellent, the decor extremely chic and modern. The wines simply amazing cannot even pick a favorite! I'm typically not into medium bodied red wines but these were simply awesome. James was super great in taking care of our needs. Would highly recommend stopping by on your Napa Valley trip.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>While I am not a big drinker to begin with, my husband and I do from time-to-time enjoy taking a nice day trip to Napa Valley. We decided to stop by Starmont Winery as we are familiar with some of their wines. What a great decision this turned out to be. We enjoyed sipping on their Cabernet while taking in the wonderful views from their vineyard. The hosts treated us well and we brought home a couple of wonderful wines to enjoy the next time we have some guests over.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x808508ebc3e84caf:0xe380673145f1b70f< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<user>100994448670796389461<//user><Review>Walked in for a tasting and was not greeted.  Instead, I was asked if I was there for a tasting?  Yes. A clipboard was put down in front of me and the bearded man informed me, "We're starting an event in an hour, so if you want a tasting..." In other words, hurry up...we've got more important things to get to.  I left immediately.  This is hardly the only vineyard in the neighborhood, one expects to be treated with a modicum of graciousness!  You have an event?  Good for you, you'll never make a sale with me or my friends, family and associates.  Go elsewhere where your business is welcome. There's plenty more to choose from.<//Review><resp>{'time': 1531524961697, 'text': 'Please accept our sincere apologies for this unfortunate experience.

< review>
Starmont was the final winery we visited at the end of a weekend in Napa. It was by far our favorite!! Although we didn’t have a reservation they were able to accommodate our party of two because we stopped by earlier in the day. I think next time we’ll make a reservation just to be sure to get a spot :)

The outdoor area is comfy and accessible by anyone (not just club members like some places). We enjoyed a fantastic wine tasting outside (only $25) and bought two bottles to take home. The wine was simply amazing and reasonably priced. Our host Dan was friendly and knowledgeable—you could tell he knows a lot about wine and loves sharing about it! Dan made our experience educational and enjoyable. Next time we come to Napa this winery is top on my list!</review>

Absolutely excellent wine. Out of four wineries we went to in the area, this was our favorite. Spencer was incredibly helpful & knowledgeable. I wish there was an option for leaving him a tip - but this will suffice. It was a great experience overall!</text>

<user_name>Neil Solanki<//user_name><review>This winery, just south of Napa, opened in July. That's why there are so few reviews. The staff was amazing, and the outdoor seating area was very pleasant (and dog friendly). Every wine we tasted was delicious and had a neat story. They also have free popcorn with gourmet salts on the side (the white truffle oil salt was yummy). I'd recommend a stop here to anyone.</review><date>1444434621826<//date></record>

Always a great find - especially now with bud break & Green fields of golden mustard a real palate for the Eyes. Wonderful selection of wines to complement the views.</Text>

<Review>Very low key and friendly place.  Wines tend to the refreshing clean and crisp side.  The pilot was a major surprise!  Very pretty tasting room and beautiful location.   Right off the Stanley Ranch Bike Path so bicycle friendly!< /Review>< Pictures>

Visited some wineries this weekend while on vacation and Starmont was hands down the best winery I went to all weekend. The staff were very knowledgeable and friendly, the location was convenient, the tasting room and seating area was beautiful, and the wines were fantastic. They have a really lovely fire pit area with comfortable couches and chairs and even blankets you can use if you get a bit chilly. What really made the difference in my mind was the staff. They were really accommodating and just good people all around. Some of the other places we went to, people were a bit snobbish and it felt like they could care less whether you were there or not. I highly recommend the GSM blend and their Chardonnay. Both were pretty fantastic in my opinion.</Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>My friends and I planned a fun filled time in Napa with a day of wine tasting. Starmont was our last winery of the day, but decided to pop in and try some wines. Granted, we were there 35 minutes before they closed, and boy did the woman that helped us let us know it. We weren't looking for some elaborate wine tasting, as we had done that all day, but how about making your guests feel welcome which would ultimately encourage us to purchase wine from you in the future?!? This women was rude, kurt, and clearly unhappy with her job. I'm actually surprised that we stayed and ordered a glass anyways. This winery is still a topic every time we return to Napa to enjoy wine and spend money, but guess what Starmont? you'll never see us again, and how unfortunate because we actually enjoyed the wine...<//Text>< pictures>

Made reservations for my husband and myself when we arrived we were given a table. Within 15 minutes we were told that the table was reserved for party of 4 that was to be arriving soon so we would have to move. I asked where was the table that I reserved? The man walked off and then came back and said oh never mind you can keep this table. We were there for about an hour and there was never an arrival of a party of four....strange experience overall</text>

Perhaps I went on a bad day... we arrived around 2pm on a Saturday. We often frequent Napa and Sonoma to pick up our wine club selections and have always noticed starmont when coming in and figured we would try it this time around.We walked in and noticed it was fairly crowded. There is a lot of seating inside of the tasting room and every seat was taken, there was plenty of room at the wine bar though. We walked up and waited patiently. There were 3 workers behind the counter and we waited around 10 minutes and was not acknowledged once. There were 2 other couples there, so I feel that there was at least some time to say we will be with you in a bit or at least a hello... but we sat there and waited. This gave us the opportunity to look around at the crowd. It was a pretty young crowd. Everyone seemed to be 21, which is fine, but it was rather loud and you could hear the random "OMG" once in awhile, similar to a bar. This environment reminded me of my college days and although it was only 6 years ago, it is something that I want nothing to do with. There was even a girl taking multiple selfies, sipping wine and posting it on snapchat. I am a former wine buyer and was disappointed that I was not able to try their wines, but the environment was very off setting. If this place wants to cater to this crowd, that is fine. This review is more aimed at those who want a relaxing environment and, frankly, want semi-decent customer service. If you just turned 21 or are new to wine, then this is the place for you.</text>

<text>Worst customer service ever. The female is absolutely rude and she rolls her eyes when you ask for anything on the sandwich. I mean the concept is build it your owen way so it makes no sense why she would have an attitude.

<response>None<//response><userid>108786621371928603569</userid><review>I had the absolute worst experience I’ve ever had in any Subway location. I ordered my sandwich on the app. When I arrived at the restaurant, Romelda told me that she never received my order. After showing two forms of order confirmation (I literally showed her the order on my phone— and she responded by saying that she’s not sure if I’m giving her the correct address), she embarrassed me in front of other customers and told me there was nothing she can do. And, when she called her manager, she took her mask off in COVID times. I still cannot believe that she berated me and refused to make me my sandwich. Now I have paid for the sandwich and did not receive it. Lessons learned: do not visit this location, do not order from the app, and do not be expected to be treated with any decency here.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Small subway. The staff were professional and the food was fine. If you are eating a subway you shouldn't expect to be amazed by the food. However the fact that you can build your own sandwich is nice and of course it is the best fast food option. Most of their new options are overpriced though the wraps are good. Long gone are the days of a $5 foot long and so it is getting more pricey. But overall when I want healthy fast food it is still my go to.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dd2bcd15e4d767:0x4bf8f084bf2ef61<//GmapID></record>

The sub sandwiches are not that great and overpriced. And a refill on my soft drink is $1.00
The cookies are delicious!

Great tasting, freshly grilled Mediterranean food, at a reasonable price point, in Vernon? Yep!

This is a franchise and you'd be skeptical that all are the same, but so far the Commerce, Vernon and Long Beach locations have not disappointed. The recipes are seemingly the same across the board, and service had been courteous and fast at all.

I personally recommend the chicken kebabs (and I'm typically beef all the way in any setting but the chicken kebab is exceptionally well seasoned).

Don't overlook the family deals as well, great value.</Review>

<Time>1593471753581</Time><rate>5<//rate><Review>I've lived in Boyle Heights & East L.A. forever & never knew this place existed, I came across it on IG one of my most favorite foods in gyros but they have to have the meat that is carved in restaurant not that gross frozed pre formed garbage that some "Mediterranean restaurants" sell..I ordered the Gyro which came served with a side salad, pickled beets & a pepperoncini and I also ordered the Gyro Mix which is gyro meat,chx kabob,beef kabob, hummus, & a side salad with 1 pita bread...also ordered an order of churros they were pictured as a bag with small churros but it only ended up being 1 regular sized churro & it had a bavarian type filling which was not stated on their google map page...both combos were for myself as I was sampling their meats as I was thinking of ordering catering for Friday...all the food was perfect even the presentation in their to-go boxes, all meats were seasoned & tender (beef is extremely tender you can pull pieces straight off the kabob), rice was fluffy, plates came with 2 sauces definately the green sauce is the best...highly recommended! Something about Mediterranean food that leaves you content & satisfied (not overstuffed) maybe it's the fresh ingredients</Review>< pics>

<review>This is a review of the Vernon Location. It's ok. If you have never been to a Green Olive you might even like it. But if you have ever been to the Commerce or Downey location this place will be disappointing. My Rice was not fully cooked, the Humus had no flavor, and the green sauce was not the same. The Chicken and Beef kabob where good though so those are redeeming factors. If you like this place and have never been to Commerce or Downey, do yourself a favor and take the drive. It's night and day.<//review><response>{'time': 1590377737736, 'text': 'Thank you for your review. We will see you next time at The Green Olive Vernon.'}< /response></record>

Edit: 11 months later and they still don't follow their own posted hours both on Google and on their own website.  Why bother?  There's so many other Mediterranean shops in the area that don't lie about their hours.

Literally the worst hours. How are they even still in business?< /Review>

Asian owner, I'm assuming is very rude. Never sees me when I go to pick up an order. Clearly spoke to the other Asian gentlemen. Just overlooked me. I was there first. The rest of the staff was super awesome to me. Appreciated that.<//Text>

Growing up in Central LA is a downer for us foodies. Only fast food chains. So when a place like this is reviewed of course it would get high stars. Central LA people have easliy pleased taste buds : /  Ordered #7. Pros; Lunch hour. Order was ready within minutes. (thank god because the parking smelled of urine and the smell got in the cafe.) The plate looked tasty. Cons; Food no bueno. I wanted to eat my salad but an untasty yogurt dressing was on the salad. Would have liked it on the side. Hummus tasted store bought. Rice was not soft or moist. Rice tatsted like Hispancs would want their mediterranean rice to taste like.(if that makes sense) Chicken was okay. Wished it was moist and marinated longer. The more I ate of the plate the less I liked the food. Thought to myself that I didn't want to continue putting below par food in my body. Last few bites I had to force myself to eat it. Will not be returing here.</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<review>I'm writing this on behalf of my parents. This past Saturday my dad purchased a barrel seat with cushion for $349. When they got it home my dad found a sign that said display model $250 which what he purchased. My mom called this morning asking for a reimbursement of the difference they said no! I don't seem to understand is this policy? My dad has been a loyal customer for years. I'm not sure who is running this place but I think other places would greatly appreciate the business. They have proof of the sign along with the receipt showing they paid $349. It hasn't been a month it was the weekend and they can't do anything about it? Unbelievable I've never seen a place with such poor customer service.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

< Review>
Purchased a car cover cost in $400. Return the car cover for a refund since it did not protect the car from rain! In California! Sales person Steve said they will do a water test to see if the car cover was defective. Which pass by with no response and my follow up I was told that it had failed the water test and that they would ship a new car cover! At this point I did not need another card cover from this company as I did not trust the quality to protect my classic car from inclement weather. Totally dissatisfied with this company‘s product for the price where you can get a least expensive car cover that truly works and protects your vehicle.
I strongly recommend you research this companies quality of product before you purchase one they are extremely expensive.
Also very poor customer service and follow up.<//Review>

California Car Cover Co. has the best customer service and selection of car covers, auto detailing products and virtually every car accessory you might need. Recently, I was having trouble finding a bike rack to fit my BMW X1 when Jimmy from CCC recommended the Sea Sucker Suction Cup Bike Rack; he knew I didn't want to have to purchase multiple products to make it work with my specific car and found me the perfect solution.  I successfully transported two bikes on a road trip spanning over 3,500 miles & 4 National Parks with no issues whatsoever.  The temperatures ranged from 100F to 25F degrees and the rack suction stayed put.  Easy to install, reliably secure, at an unbeatable price.  Thanks, Cal Car Cover Co!</Text>

<review>GREAT customer service!!  I recently ordered a car cover for my 1970 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme SX on Amazon and I ordered the wrong cover for my car.  They allowed me to return the incorrect cover and sent me the correct car cover with no hassle at all.  Today, I purchased a fender cover for this classic and I'm sure it will be a quality product, as well.  Keep up the good work at California Car Cover Company!!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>Highly recommend CCC!! bought a cover form them more than 3 years ago and used it daily in a snowy area in Utah. The cover is an excellent product fits my vehicle like a glove. Recently it started to rip so I called and spoke to Rick, he was extremely helpful honored the warranty and he sent me a new cover at no charge. Excellent service triple C keep it up! Thank you Rick!<//review><resp>None</resp><pictures>None< /pictures>< Date>

Very friendly those working there.
Most of all, they know their products and what should be the best for your project. Whether a car cover, inside outside, rain or shine. Best waxes, paint conditioners. Well stocked.<//Text>

I only use California car covers on all my cars. Just bought my 3rd cover for my 2001 GMC hot rod truck. i have owned it since brand new. Just want to say thank you to Monte @ ext.147. He was very helpful and most important very patience with me when i changed my order the next day. His recommendation on which car cover to buy was spot on.  Thanks again Monte. Ready to order my Chevelle cover next.<//Review>

<Text>It’s been almost a month since I ordered my car cover. I even paid extra for expedited shipping.  They don’t respond to emails and don’t answer the phone. They took my money( $275)no problem but as far as the product goes I never received it and it looks as though I never will.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c29c99a4cbf435:0x58e68ecbf96a8c22</gmap_id></record>

after 3 covers all of which ripped badly I bought their best which came off with wind so i called them - they told me ship it to them at my expense. They were insulting. now the seams have come a part even though they may replace it at my shipping expense - I have had it.  so now i am buying a life time cover for same money from a better company with life time warrenty.</review>

<Text>Amazing customer service! I had some issues with measurements due to having a wing on the rear of my car and they went out of their way twice to go out to Ford and get those measurements. How cool! Love the car cover fits perfectly!</Text>< Pics>

I have always seen other cars with covers in parking lots at work and always seen them completely off the car because of wind and the only thing holding it is it being strap down on bottom of car so never had interest in buying one,but last year someone at my apartment duplex had her car covered and it took my interest because fit like a glove had the name on front of car that was from California car covers and this year I ordered my for my Cadillac and I love it so much they are the best quality car covers,I'm completely satisfied thank you California Car Covers ♡</Text>

Ordered a dash board cover for a 2016 Winnebago Journey. James was very helpful in making sure I was ordering the right one.
Received it a little less than 2 weeks. Open it put it on my dash and it fits like a glove. The only hole that was missing, on the back side of the instrument cluster I have a 12 volt plug maybe not on all units. The little valley on the passenger side is not present again maybe all units don't have this. I think over time and use that will stretch in. 100% satisfied and will order again for future items.

I ordered and received my car seat covers from California Car Cover. They helped me install them and they look great now. Brandon was very helpful with my concerns and assisted me when I initially wasn't happy with the head rest covers. Really appreciated his efforts and would buy from them again!<//Review>

I purchased a cover for my 1960 Classic wagon...I purchased one with the 4 year warranty.  After a year or a bit more...it started tearing up in random spots...I contacted CalCover...they replaced it no problem.  After this one is out in the sun etc...same issue...holes in random spots and the material become  brittle wherever you'd grab it, it would tear!  I contacted Support once again, they asked me for my name etc...this is their response....

Dear, Eddie

I checked your warranty and you purchased your car cover on 8/08/2012 so your warranty has expired, since our warranty is only four years. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

Thank You,
Jose
Customer Service

and my response...

Wow.. So instead of offering me options, seeing as how badly your product is tearing up, it's "sorry, you're no longer covered under warranty since it expired, thanks".  Needless to say it's very unprofessional and un friendly.  I will no longer be purchasing products from your because of that and I'll be taking my business elsewhere.

Thank you for your time.

Sad to say, bad customer service.  Maybe I took the response wrong I dont know.  I love my car, would not of minded purchasing a new cover if this was going to continue.  But this response was just bad...I even sent him pictures of the issue...as you can see, not good.   Hopefully you can make your own judgement on the material and service from this company.  Looking elsewhere for a cover.< /Text>

Excellent cover and excellent customer service!  I was given my cover for my Trans Am as a gift and there was a minor error which was no fault of the company.  I called the company and talked to a friendly and helpful person in AMERICA who spoke English!  The problem was corrected promptly and the quality, fit and look of the cover was excellent.  I would highly recommend their covers and the company!</Text>

I bought a cover from california car cover a year ago... it showed signs of wear and tear and called in for a warranty inspection. Mailed it back. They inspected it, deemed it not good anymore and did a full brand new replacement no questions asked. I would never go with another company again after such incredible customer service. California car cover for the win!!!<//Text>

Unfortunately the negative reviews are true. I wanted to switch to california car cover and tried to order a plush weave cotton cover for my BMW. They offer an option to embroid text on the cover with $25 for 7 letters each additional letter costing extra but space characters are not charged. Well they charged me all the space characters. I thought no big deal i'll contact them, wrote a nice email to them. Received an automated robot reply that they will contact me within time. Two weeks laters and no reply. I sent another email explaining they had not replied. 1 month later, no reply. 2 months later, no reply. now 11 month later still no reply. Only now i find all these negative reviews on them. They have zero customer service, and are rude to people. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM you have been warned !!!< /review>

They gladly took payment for a product they didn't actually have. 23 days after they took my money, 21 days after the ship date they gave me, I called. They had no explanation. They promised to get back to me later that day with shipping info. They didn't. They still won't provide any info. The product was marked on site as being "in stock" which is why I ordered from them even though prices a little higher than elsewhere. But, here it is 25 days later, and item not even on way to me yet. I'm calling credit card company to cancel/retract payment. NOT PLEASED!< /review>

Been a customer for seven years. great customer service and warranty support. my new Superweave SW covers for Subaru Forester and Volvo S60 both fit like a glove. The Superweave is really easy to work with. A prior SW cover for an old Saab 9000 fit perfectly and was replaced after three years due to a tear under warranty without any questions - just sent them photos. The replacement cover is still going after 4 years. That cover was left on car in the sun at the local airport about 70% of time - so it held up well. Customer Service was reason I went back for the two new covers! Cover kept the car finish lovely and expect same with new ones (Hint: never put a cover on a car unless you just washed it).<//review>

The online help/Customer service is non existent, I made numerous attempts over several weeks to get help via email with absolutely no response whatsoever. You have to call if you want any kind of assistance from them. I finally called yesterday, asked to speak with a manager and someone named Alisa (supposedly a manager) got on the phone and immediately had a bad attitude, was rude then hung up on me.

<time>1523315229379< /time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>Buyer beware.  California Car Covers' products are not worth the money, and their warranty is meaningless.  I bought one of their most expensive covers.  The seam around the rear view mirror was not stitched.  I contacted the company and sent clear pictures of the defect.  They emailed me indicating that in order to have their mistake corrected, I would have to pay to have the cover shipped back to them which was quite expensive.  What a sneaky way to avoid making good on a warranty.  I will NEVER order from them again.  Poor quality control, horrible customer service and worthless product warranties!

I had some worn spots coming through on the corners of the cover.
It was about a year-and-a-half-old called customer service they gave me a return number.
I sent the cover back and about two and a half weeks later I got a brand new cover great job good customer service</Text>

Monte was great with helping me with the right product for my personal application! I have a lifted 4x4 and wanted extra length at the bottom to make up the differance. I can't wait for my truck cover to arrive.</review>

Has your car cover been returned to you yet? I tried to look up your order history by username, but I could not locate a passed order. Our material suppliers introduced some new warranty protocols earlier this year that have unfortunately slowed our timely warranty turn around.

Just pray you don't need the warranty.  I had a cover that fell apart on me after a year of use.  It started showing UV damage even though the cover was rated for outdoor use.  I have the car parked outdoors and the sun really tested the cover.  The cover is under warranty for 4 years so I sent the cover back and have been waiting for 2 months with no cover.  Really bad Customer Support.  I don't remember this company being this way 10 years ago.  Come on guys I know you can do better!<//text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>I bought a California Car cover for my 1923 Ford Bucket T from a third party distributor (Speedway Motors).  When I accidentally burned a hole in it from my hot pipes, I called California Car Cover to buy  a repair kit/material (I did not want anything for free).  The second that they heard I bought it from a third party, they abruptly said that they could not provide me the material.  When I called Speedway Motors, they said that they did not have the repair material for the cover.  I let Speedway Motors know what kind of "service" that California Car Cover is giving their customers.  California Car Cover, if you don't want to service customers from third party vendors, then you should not sell your car covers wholesale to other vendors.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Despite the mistake being entirely on the side of the supplier, California Car Cover Customer Service refused a refund of money for several weeks until return of defective product was received.

Customer service relented to an immediate refund after the promise of legal action, but threatened to illegally charge my credit card should the item not be returned.  Refund of money is still pending.<//review>< gmapID>

You have to order the most expensive cover because the others are all cheap crap.  It's best to keep covered in a garage or the sun and other elements will wreak it. Horrible customer service. E-mail them and you get no response.<//Review>

<rate>2<//rate><review>You don't get a new warranty with a completely new cover after warranty. I had a warranty issue with a cover that they issued a new cover for, I paid extra and upgraded to a new material...so it's a brand new cover now. The stitching is coming apart now well within the normal 4 year warranty period for the HD fabric and I was told that the warranty was only valid from the start of the original cover. That would make sense if they repaired the original cover, but this was a brand new cover (with a 4 yr warranty) with basically a 6 month warranty. I've bought 6 covers over the past 10ys and wanted to buy more, but now I will look elsewhere.

I've had issues with other covers made from the Superweave material coming apart in the sun, but clearly stated on their website that it's meant for outside use. The covers that were under warranty they did take care of and even one that was out of warranty I paid for a new one because I liked the fit and the company then. I've paid extra to upgrade to the Superweave HD material (on the warranty covers) now with great success. This last one is clearly a manufacturing problem as the material is fine but the stitching is disappearing after 2 yrs. When I called I was told it's out of warranty and to take it to a seamstress.  When they warrantied the last cover, I paid to upgrade to the new HD material and was told that since the cover was BRAND NEW it had a new warranty.< /review>< pics>

Their car covers are not what they used to be and the company does not stand by their products.   I have had 2 brand new Superweave covers tear like wet toilet paper after a day in the rain.  Whats worse, their customer service is horrible.  Jason is a Pr@*k and he will lie to get a sale.  DO NOT BUY FROM CALIFORNIA CAR COVER... YOU'VE been warned.

The room was nice. Big queen size bed. Nice view of the beach. Amazing shower. Had a TV, mini fridge, coffee machine, and soap/shampoo/conditioner. Our only issue was being the room under a balcony so at 4 am, the person above us would open and close the sliding door and stomp onto the patio and scrape the chair against the ground.< /review>

There were quite a few issues with our stay at Casablanca. Neither room was ready even though the check-in time was 4PM. #15 was ready at 4:30, but #213 wasn't ready 'till 5:30PM. The staff (cleaning & desk) were diligent, but it was evident that Casablanca is simply under-staffed. The grounds/landscape looked "tired" & ignored. The common area tables, walkways & patios were filthy. (A cleaning towel was left outside so we wiped the table off & the towel became BLACK!) Even if 4 people are registered in the room you get 2 bath towels, 2 coffee cups, condiments for 2, etc. - we had to ask for more. There were other minor issues - outside wall was still under construction, the line to register for your room was 30" & then another 30" for the second room (couldn't register for both as neither was ready), there was only verbal verification of your cost on both the registration & checkout, so you have to hope /assume all is OK when you get home to view your CC. We liked the old time feel of Casablanca but the amenities were  minimally  cared for. Additional staff would likely solve a lot of the issues regarding care & attendance.< /Text>

<Text>Rooms look nothing like the pictures! My room was a king with view, but it was dark and had absolutely no decorations or accessories, not even a soap holder. Definitely not what I was expecting for the price.<//Text>< Pics>

Positive: Location. Negative: Lights in the bathroom didn¿t work. Had to take showers in the dark.   The TV remote didn¿t work so we had to get up and change the volume & channels.   Had to take out our own trash.   No fresh towels.   Maintenance was terrible.   Definitely overprice<//Review>

Gross place. Location was awesome but the room and bathroom in the room was disgusting. I should have taken photos but we were ready to get out of there. The toilet seat looked absolutely disgusting. Stained and tattered my wife was ver uncomfortable and my 4 year old son even said eww the toilet is dirty and decided to pee in the shower. The floor of the hotel was covered in sand. I understand it’s Dwight next to the beach and a little sand can get missed but this much makes me wonder if they even cleaned the room. Over all disappointing for $700 a night. We are not the type to write a bad review, we understand that things get missed occasionally and we are all human. But when speaking with the host about the toilet seat being gross she laughed. So I will not return because they don’t seem to care. :(.<//review>

Stayed here with my gf to celebrate my birthday and we thoroughly enjoyed our time. The view speaks for itself. If you want to stay at the beach, look no further! Room was modern and shower was huge! Walking distance to shops downtown and wharf across the street. Staff was friendly and made sure to follow covid protocols. Will be coming back soon!<//review>

<text>The hotel is in a great location, but the rooms are tiny and old.We had an “ocean view” room, with the ocean view being across a public patio. Would have been ok for about half the price. They charge on par with the Dream Inn, but have much older and smaller rooms and worse views. The parking is convenient, though.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Text>I know I posted a whole review. Not sure how it was taken down so I will write it again.
I was appalled by the manager and his inability to be kind and helpful under stress. He had a new girl helping him and was still unable to be very helpful. I needed a room for one night spur of the moment, I'd lost my cat been sleeping in my car for 4 nights in big sur I just wanted a room. This man would Not help me! He took everyone else ahead of me before he would help me. It took 3 hours to finally be able to check in at the desk even though I was standing there the whole time. He just kept taking everyone else.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>We paid extra for the "scenic view" and got a room looking at a construction full of trash with the beach on the side if you got close to the window. Make sure you call and ask what your view will be like before booking.

Other than that you really can't beat the location, the room was pretty big and nice and they're pet friendly which is great. Service was also good and parking was easy.

Overall, unless you NEED to be right next to the beach you can do much better for the price. It's too expensive for a bad view and the noise that comes with being right next to the main road. It's basically a nicer motel.< /Text>< Rating>

<Text>I Certainly was CAT FISHED!!!! Seriously
The pictures on the website of Casablanca inn and suites as well as booking.com are NOTHING  compared to what it actually looks like in person. The family suit with Ocean view doesn’t really have a ocean view. Although the room is very spacious but Feels and looks like an old cabin. The Heater in the room dose not work. If you’re looking for the ocean view room you would need to request room 202 which has the balcony view which is big enough for a family of five facing the ocean. I was also over charged so be careful and screenshot your reservation which states what room you reserved along with the price you should pay at hotel.< /Text>< resp>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>Great place to stay! Right across the street from the boardwalk and wharf. Several dining options within walking distance. A mile or so from downtown. Minutes to capitola. Pet friendly. Nice gravel fenced in dog walk. I booked an ocean view room. The room was not quite as I expected and the easily honored my request to relocate. Stay in rooms 1 - 6. The balcony is shared but we were lucky to have super chill neighbors. The balcony is right above beach street overlooking the volleyball courts with great views of the ocean, wharf and amazing sunsets< /Text></record>

The location of the Inn is very good and just a block away from the beach, and within walking distance to the boardwalk. The Inn was recently remodeled, which is nice. But, the management was not that good. We arrived there around 3:30PM, hoping we could check in by then, but, the front desk told us the room was not ready till 4:00PM. We saw a long line waiting for check in at 4PM. The lobby is small and there were no social distances at all. We got our room and it took 15 minutes to find our room as there were no signs on the property showing the directions. The coffee machine was missing in our room, the hair dryer was on the floor, which should be hanging on the bathroom wall. The show stall did not have any hanger or basket you could put the soap, shampoo/condition bottles which were all on the floor inside show stall. The towers provided were old and rough, Which were not matched up with the newly remodeled the bathroom. The curtain fell off when we tried to close it at night.< /text>

<text>My room was dirty. There was hair in the shower and on one of the towels. During a pandemic when everything is supposedly extra clean... definitely not the case. Not to mention there is a raging party going on in the room upstairs and nobody is at the front desk to receive the complaint. Definitely would not recommend this place.<//text>< pictures>

We decided to get an oceanfront room for our wedding weekend. The first room we were offered smelled like cigarette smoke although it was stated as a nonsmoking room. We tried opening the balcony door and the door handle fell off. The door wasn’t even fully closed so we can tell maintenance knew this wasn’t a working door. I ended up bringing the door handle down to the front desk and let them know that we were going to need a new room. There were no other king bed rooms available so we were placed into a new double queen room. Now, I get COVID has been rough for businesses, so that doesn’t escape me with this situation. But this room was bare. To the point that there wasn’t anything on the walls, no closet for our things, no rugs on the plastic floor, and no headboards on the beds, not even a single chair. The cleaning service did not come while we were away the second day and the room itself had not been swept or mopped in a few days/guest visits.So, we were hoping we would be offered some type of partial refund for being put in a lower end room with queen beds for our wedding nights or maybe at least a credit for a future visit, but nope. Honestly, overall we are grateful that we have something to laugh at during the weekend and got to start our marriage off tackling weird situations like this hotel with humor. So, thanks!<//Review>

Our original room was a small suite with a view of the beach that was already breathtaking; however one of the amazing staff members moved us to a second story suite with a king bed and a private balcony that perfectly overlooked the beach and ocean. The view was stunning and is worth every cent to book here, especially waking up in the morning to see the sunrise on the ocean and beach, and the hotel is so close to the beach you can fall asleep at night to the sound of waves crashing on the sand. We will definitely be staying here again next time we spend a vacation in Santa Cruz.</Text><Gmap_id>0x808e402ecc84593d:0x6394f41fdfd89955< /Gmap_id>< pics>

The Captain’s Suite is fantastic beautiful and romantic. The huge two person hammered copper soaking tub placed strategically in front of the large fireplace made my heart sing!!! And rest of me felt heavenly after a long hot soak.  The 180 degree view of the ocean pretty much guarantees perfectly picturesque sunrises and sunsets. And the sound of waves crashing on the beach will relax anyone’s soul.

Valentines Day is coming so if you want to have memories forever you’ll want to stay at the Casablanca.

All I can say is stay at the Casablanca in Santa Cruz and try your best to get the Captains Suite if it is available!!’

The entire team is friendly professional and accommodating.

I’ll be coming back every month from now on that’s how much I love it!!! Thank you Casablanca!!!< /text>

We stayed here last weekend and it was the best decision we ever made! The Casablanca Inn is charmingly decorated and surrounded with breathtaking views. At first, there was a delay in our stay because of problems with our booking. Fortunately, Mrs. Nita kindly gave us an extension and upgraded our room so that we were right across the beach. We will definitely visit again.< /text>

<Review>We stayed in older room (16), view was nice but definitely overpriced. It needs a makeover, pics online were far better than actual appearance. Apparently, there was a shortage of towels and staff works limited hours.</Review><date>1617580800000</date>< Rating>

We stayed last week in room 20. Our 9 month old son came with us so finding a room to accommodate a babies needs. We called prior to see if we could check in early and was it was possible, due to it being nap time, unfortunately we could not. After officially checking in, we dropped off our belongings and went sight seeing. The location is amazing and thr view are beautiful. Later that evening, we were getting ready for bed when we found a pill under the entertainment center the  dresser and a bottle cap near the window. As we pulled the sheets back we noticed the sheets were dirty. Luckily we brought an extra blanket as it was our sons bedtime the focus was putting him to bed.
We attempted to contact contact management at 8am when they opened; however,  no one was at the counter.<//text>

<review>When my family and I went in, we heard a man yelling  at one of the staff members for walking in on his daughter while she was changing. That should have been the first red flag. Secondly, when we checked in, they told us our room wouldn’t look very pretty because it was “under construction”, which isn’t safe at all, but we continued. Then we walked into the room, with one of the walls half painted, stained sheets, and a giant hole in the wall. We didn’t even stay for the night, and ended up leaving a few hours later, after we went shopping for a bit. The view was really nice, but being honest everything else was terrible</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>As a local, I never thought to staycation over here but since recently moving out of state and returning for a work trip - this last minute booking was my favorite. Great place for us and the dog! Super clean rooms, comfy bed, big bathroom with a rain shower 😍 and an excellent view. The staff was really nice. Will for sure be booking again on my next trip home.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOr3VgpaMBkxlYVa48TWGxNlgAIZpaXiDJYBT8t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCrafoQLV71HhzJyxxY1obpqVHJyHJodZzQiUQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

Me and my husband decided to take a road trip down the California/Oregon coast and we booked one of their new rooms to stay the night in. The room was perfect size with comfortable bed and very large flat screen TV (the fact that the tv was on a swivel/extender mount and could be adjusted was a big bonus). The bathroom was beautifully done, with large mirror which had led lights behind it, creating a beautiful glow. The shower was large, with rain and regular shower heads. My favorite part of the room was the private balcony, and of course the location. Being able to sit on the balcony enjoying ocean view and beach activities going on while sipping on my coffee was the best part of our trip for me.< /text>

<review>The stay itself wasn’t horrible. The front desk service was awful. We called for some more blankets and was told we had to go and get them ourselves. Which wouldn’t have been a big deal if it wasn’t freezing outside. What was really the issue is I didn’t get charged for our room until a month later! I just got a random charge that over drafted my account. Unacceptable. I have never had a hotel do this. The view was gorgeous I will admit, but I won’t be staying there again due to the unreliable accounting that takes place.< /review></record></dataset><record>

We stayed here for one night and our stay was great. You can’t beat the location as it’s 2min walk from the beach and boardwalk. Easy check in check out. Would come back again. Just one note the sofa bed could be more comfortable. But overall great experience.< /Review>

<username>Shyaan Khan< /username><Date>1612978628124<//Date><Rating>1<//Rating><text>Due to serious health issues, we aren't able to eat outside, so we always bring home cooked food. For this trip, we absolutely needed a microwave. When I booked this room, I called to ensure that we'll have a microwave and a refrigerator in our room. The person at the front desk confirmed that I will have that, which I expected to be the standard across all hotels.

When we arrived, I was very surprised to find out that our room had a fridge, but no microwave. I asked the man at the front desk if he could get me one, but he said they are all out of microwaves, and our only option was to walk all the way to the front desk and have the man microwave our food for us in the back. Not only was that putting our food in the hands of others, which during COVID, is not ideal, but it was a huge inconvenience having to come down to the front office each time we wanted to eat.

Less importantly, our room didn't even have a hairdryer, another basic essential item that we have had in every hotel we've stayed at. The front desk didn't have any in the back either.

I'm very disappointed with the lack of essentials, especially the lack of the microwave, at this hotel. If I knew there would be no microwave in our room ahead of time, I would have booked somewhere else. This made our experience very poor at this hotel.

I messaged them about this following my stay and they responded with "Next time call us ahead of time to make sure you're accommodated"... that's exactly what I did last time< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

We stayed here for one week and we really enjoyed it. The room and restroom were remodeled and clean. We were here with our 2 small dogs. It is pet friendly which was one of the reasons we chose this hotel. Keep in mind that there is a $25 pet fee. They have a pet area with waste bags but it has small rocks, wish it was grass instead. The ocean view from our room was amazing! Only complaints was that they are doing construction and workers start hammering away at 7am every morning. We also found hair on some of the pillows. Overall, it was a very cozy hotel with good a price for its location. Parking was free.< /Review>

The only thing that was nice about the room was that the beach was right outside. However, the room was dirty, old, and oddly decorated. There was hair and dirt, and the worst part was a dirty band-aid in the room :[ If it was cheaper I wouldn't be so disappointed, but given the price, I was expected at least a clean room.
Again, waking up next to the beach is great, but I wouldn't stay here again.<//review>

<Text>I can't believe I wasted a hundred thousand points on this place for a weekend. The only thing they have going for them is the location on the boardwalk.   The photos are misleading. The furnishings are old and worn out, not a picture on the wall or even a lamp on the night stand. The television only offered standard cable channels. If I had spent real money $500 a night I would be really sad right now.<//Text>< Pictures>

<name>Matt Arrington</name><review>I don't usually leave reviews online, but my experience here was so poor I felt obliged to warn others. I booked a room here for a weekend getaway with my girl friend, for Friday and Saturday night last February, 2021. With tax the room came out to $400.00 a night. Pricey, but it is close to the water, and the pictured rooms looked decent.

The room we stayed in was dark, poorly lit, and didn't have enough windows. Right off when we got in to the room we noticed a loud squeal coming from the walls, and this was 9:30 at night. It sounded like it was coming from laundry equipment that ran constantly throughout our stay. There was also an ice machine outside that had a loud fan that kept turning on and off all night. I never thought of ice machines being loud before this, but this one was. The walls seemed to be paper thin, and we could clearly hear conversations going on in the office next door. It was early in the morning, when I asked them if they could keep it down, and they just kept chatting it up, as if we never even asked. There was a ton of foot traffic in front of the room as people were checking in / out. The bathroom sink was outside the bathroom, and shoved in to a corner in the main bedroom, which was just plain weird. The last straw for me was when we ran out of toilet paper.

We asked for a different room, and they refused to move us. They refused to give any discount or refund. His argument for not giving money back was that room quality was "subjective" which I just found insulting given how bad the room was. He was willing to give us a discount on a future stay, and he admitted to having better rooms, but after such a bad experience no way I am going back there and giving them any more of my money.

TLDR - If you want to play a game of motel room roulette than this is your place, otherwise I would keep looking!< /review><user>105885179783734312213< /user>< Rate>

<Text>Terrible experience - I have stayed here dozens of times, however, this most recent stay, they have remodeled their parking lot and narrowed the spaces in such a manner (I don't know this is even legal) that each car is just inches from the next. Sure enough my new car (Compact Toyota Rav4) was still hit. The manager was reluctant to offer any resolve and refused to give me the name and number of his boss. He did say he would follow up with the camera footage but never did that either. We know if I would have left a mess in the room, they would have certainly charged me a fee but in this case they did nothing as a resolve. Complete disregard and terrible service.<//Text>< Rate>

<rate>3<//rate><text>The view from my room was beautiful and Mark at the check in desk was very friendly and accommodating. However, I could hear the guests upstairs who carried on very loud conversations past midnight. My room was also in a location where there was a lot of foot traffic, so it wasn't very quiet at all. The room and the bathroom were clean, and I enjoyed the large overhead shower. The Thai restaurant was only steps away and the duck curry was delicious. For the price, I expected a quieter, more relaxing evening. If I were to stay here again, I would ask for a different room.< /text>< Pics>

Such a beautiful hotel in a great location! Our window looked right out over the ocean and we could open it so we could hear the waves in the morning. Wine and sunset on our balcony was so relaxing. The room was clean and the staff was kind. Will definitely be staying here again if we return to the area!!<//Review>

< Review>
What a lovely hotel on the beach. They have done a lot of remodeling and upgrades on the overall aesthetic. The Front Desk lady, Lennon was welcoming, professional and helpful. Our room was clean and still had a faint small of bleach which I love because it means it is clean. The beds were comfy, stocked with all the little kitchen electronics you need when staying across the street from the beach (e.g. microwave, kuerig, and fridge). This is a dog friendly property with a small dog run for fido at night when the property gates are closed. Well and the view was stunning.<//Review>

Positive: The only positive is the location and view. Negative: Rooms were not ready for those who are checking in at 4 pm. The check in process is long. Rooms smell, everything is old, furniture has stains. The toiletries were empty, limited quantity of towels.<//review>

<review>Extremely disappointing!! Paid $400 for one night for the family suit that fits 6. To only have 2 towels. The kitchen and patio lights did not work. No bedding or pillows for the pull out beds. No kitchen utensils. And I asked for early check in and didn’t get checked in until 4:15pm. I would have rather stayed at a Motel 6.<//review>< Rating>

< Review>
Nice cozy ocean side spot. Nicer than the usual “just a place to sleep” simple Santa Cruz spots. But, upon showing up at 1045am to check in, was told the room wasn’t ready yet. I asked why, they said check out isn’t until 11(understandable) and that room service has to clean it(also understandable) so ask “...about what time?” They said; “around 1”

I come back after 1, still not ready I ask; “when should I come back” they said they’d call me when the room is ready. I ask “what time is check in officially” they said “4pm” (4 pm check IN?! Crazy) so I go to the beach 10 miles down the road, then to a bar, then they call me around 330pm about my room being ready.

Kinda inconvenient how it takes them that long(after 11am check out) to get a room cleaned and ready... the place isn’t/wasn’t that big or crowded.

Oh well. It was cozy clean and the bathroom was big.<//Review>

<text>First I would suggest that u give every room enough coffee to last them while they are there, instead of having to call each day for it, and that goes for towels too. The entrance door was not a secure door my 11 yr. Old grandson could of broke thru that door. The young ladies that were there were great, polite and always had a smile.</text>< name>

Paid over 500 dollars for partially cleaned room that had ants coming from the baseboards, and when I told front desk they said it’ll be an extra 300 a night for another room.  Not one to complain but with how much the price was originally you would think  there wouldn’t be sharing the room with insects.<//Text>

< Review>
No wi-fi, or at least we weren’t given access at all, The location is great, the view we had was very lovely, however, the room is outdated despite being told they had just renovated. The door to our room was very difficult to open had to use force to push in. Carpets were very dirty, stains on carpet flooring. Had ONE bath towel, for a family of 3 staying. No outlets available within reach, had to plug in near TV, and the most disappointing thing for myself being a huge coffee lover was how dirty the Keurig in our room was, and my coffee tasted as if i was drinking years old coffee because of the lack of cleaning :(  overpriced for the quality of the rooms, but the location is perfect, the staff was very kind and made checking in and out easy/smooth. Parking was very tight, there is one lane entrance/exit and we were almost hit by someone speeding out of there. Location was my favorite thing, but other than that we most likely will not return..<//Review>

I am beyond words for how we have been treated and taken care of during our unexpected stay at Casablanca Inn. We were evacuated from our home in Felton due to the fires, and all the hotels we found were booked and unwilling to help. We are locals here and have never stayed near the wharf. After a lot of searching, we finally came across Casablanca Inn and gave them a call. They were sympathetic, made a room available, let us pay night by night, extended our parking passes, and so much more to help in this unsure time. The staff was friendly, the room was clean and the beds were super comfy. We had our own patio with an ocean view. They are not only pet friendly, but they are pet forward :) They never asked me what kind of dog I had or what his temperament was (I have a 70lb pitbull btw) they greeted my dog as well and they have an outdoor enclosed potty area for them with poop bags and a garbage can. Lastly, they gave us a huge local evacuee discount was made things a little easier to deal with. Thank you Casablanca Inn and staff for all you did for us the past few days. This will now be an annual stay for us going forward!< /review>

Everything was as promised. First the view is breathtaking and panoramic. Casablanca is within walking distance of everything including the beach, boardwalk, arcade, junk food and family restaurants. Downtown Santa Cruz is a 5 minute Lyft ride away or about a 10 minute walk. The bathroom was nice, big and remodeled. Most of all I loved the Casablanca for it’s charm and view we had from our front porch patio. The room was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would totally stay again.</text>

<userid>116882300308215102017< /userid><text>Honest Review- awesome location about a 3 minute walk to the beach and boardwalk. The room is so so. Very much outdated for the price. The rooms look nothing like the pictures online and are very tiny. You can hear literally everything with how thin the walls are. The customer service is excellent and very friendly crew. Our bed seemed lopsided and sunk in a lot same with the couch. You are paying for the location and convenience to the beach. I do like the private parking on the property if you can find a spot. I would probably not stay here again for the price.<//text><Time>1593931985715</Time><resp>{'time': 1594579435072, 'text': 'Hi Caleb,\nWe do appreciate the honesty 100%.

The views are really the only thing this place has going for it. No elevator. The handful of locks on the door made me really worried. Had to ask the cleaning lady if she could reclean the bathroom and have their maintenance guy tighten the toilet to the floor. But the view....LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION</text>

Positive: The view from my room was amazing. Negative: The first night a band played loud music until 1am and the second night the people in the next room were loud until 2am. The phone in the room did not work. There was no washcloth in the room.<//text>

< review>
We’ve stayed here occasionally over the last several years. It used to be charming, but it has gotten worse with each visit. This time, we were given room keys but no room number. We returned to get number and were told “34, upstairs”. The main building had no #34, so we went up the stairs of a nearby building where all of the doors were open and not numbered. We returned to ask where exactly the room was, and the guy made a vague gesture toward the parking lot. We found another building, which we did not know was part of the hotel, and found #34, which was on the ground floor. We opened door to an odd set of stairs which led up to room which was on different levels. There was no tv in bedroom. When I turned on bathroom faucet, it sprayed the wall and floor. There was no counterspace—you could either put your toiletries on the back of the toilet or windowsill, since there was no flat surface on sink. From reading reviews tonight, I see that a dog stayed in our room a few days before we did. We will not be returning to this hotel.< /review>

< review>
Great location, just steps away from the beach and volleyball nets. Great views from the patio. The downside...The hotel is very dated and could use some maintenance and supplies in the room. Kitchenette had no forks, 1 knife and no spoons. The beach and surrounding streets can be very noisy, even off season<//review>

<review>I LOVED their family rooms ! So much space ! The staff was so friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is amazing. The views are outstanding. And the location is PERFECT!  We were right across from the beach so we didnt  have to worry about parking or walking 6 miles to be comfortable.  The only thing is that the parking lot was under construction so we had parking , loading and unloading dilemmas. But othere than that 10 stars ! Santa cruz's hidden gem !</review>< Pictures>

Went in January 2020 and was ver impressed with the room. Very clean and the beds were so comfortable with high quality bedding. We had a balcony room with a beautiful view of the beach. I differently will stay again. I remember as a little girl my parents taking us to Santa Cruz and looking at that hotel while on the beach wishing we could be staying there. Well I finally did many years later.</Text>

We were just here one night, but our stay was nice. I saw a number of reviews that complained about this property, but we like it. It is a historic property, but everything I saw was nicely updated and maintained. I had two small complaints. We were in one of the rooms near beach drive. The noise was not an issue, but the distance to the parking lot is crazy. I had to carry everything up four flights of stairs and walk a good distance to the lot. That may change when they finish construction. The other issue was the 3 foot by 4 foot window over the air conditioner. The large window in the room is curtained and can be closed reasonably well. The smaller window only has blinds,and very bright lights outside. My room was as bright as midday all night. It would be nice to have curtains on that window.</Review>

The location is excellent for beach access, walking to boardwalk and has balconies with great view of beach for people watching and relaxing. Down side is the rooms were not very nice and kinda small. Quality of room about a 2 star and the location and view a 5 star.< /review>

The location of the hotel made us want to stay here.  Unfortunately, the room was not clean.  We found other people's hair in various places.  A glass cup had remnants of juice in it and we hadn't even drank anything.  There was an old fashioned heater in the living room and it was so loud we had to turn up the television just to hear the television because of the noise from the heater/ac unit.  There was no heater in the bedroom.  The walls were dirty.  There were no extra towels or blankets for the sofa bed.  The bathroom was renovated.  This place has so much potential, and the owners should be ashamed of what they are charging based on what you are getting...at least based on the room we stayed in. We were so disappointed we went and checked out the  Dream Inn which had been renovated and was much nicer.  As the Casablanca renovates the hotel, remember the saying "you've got to spend money to make money".  Please spend it on professional front desk service and a good cleaning service.</text>

The view from the hotel was beautiful. We had a view of the ocean, beach and the pier from our rooms and the patios. All within walking distance. We enjoyed the sounds of the waves and the breeze coming thru the window. Rooms were cozy, beds conforable and staff was friendly Met some very friendly people.  Will definitely be back<//Text>

Cheap hotel with a lot of “sharing”. Asked if there was an upgrade I didn’t mind paying extra for and we finally got a private patio. But the place is still very cheap and hazardous. Almost broke my leg going to the bathroom. Gotta wait FOREVER for the hot water to turn on: the concierge didn’t seem one bit remorseful as if i was trying to get a free night or something saying this was their best room-.- never coming back that’s for sure</Text>

Went to cook and as looking for pots opened doors under sink to find food trash inside,  Also found some dirty dishes. Had it been cleaned properly  I found the beds real comfortable.

Unfortunately! I had to give 1 star to post my review. Room was dirty. Window in room was not covered with blackout curtains so we laid in bed looking n thinking about the filth. There was a group of homeless people blocking our view of the beach. We were planning on staying 3 nights but upon checkin decided on just 1. The office was supposed to be open at 8am with coffee for guests put out. I waited outside office listening to someone in office speaking on their phone in Spanish. Another employee showed up about 8:20am I told him I was waiting to talk to someone about my stay. He told me to wait for a younger woman to show up. I finally talked to her at about 8:40am. She took my info n assured me someone in management would get ahold of me. I waited a few days and emailed. No response. Emailed a 2nd and 3rd time. Finally I talked to a man named Earl on the phone when I called. He was friendly and assured me he would talk to owner n get this taken care of. This was back in September we stayed in August. I never heard from anyone again. I have called during normal business hours and no answer n no voicemail option. I was so disappointed we paid about $300 for this one night. There was so much dust on the ceiling fan I didnt dare turn it on though our room was stuffy. After seeing the fans condition i took a closer look as I used to manage a major hotel housekeeping department. I found about 3 months worth of dust on headboards and vanity mirror. Also I found an empty alcohol bottle behind the microwave. The floors were so dingy tht our socks and feet were black by the time we went to bed. I gave them the opportunity to make this right before reviewing our stay. Do not stay here this location is great and property has potential but staff does not have passion for the hospitality business.< /Text>

I really wished they would of have mentioned there was construction going on. Like any person that goes on vacation, I wanted to relax and sleep in a little but that was impossible with the construction noises that started at 7am. This used to be my favorite hotel to stay at, but not any longer. If management wants to contact me, feel free to.< /review>

I have to give it three stars for the location and the bed was very comfortable.  Otherwise it was more expensive then the itinerary said.  But the worst part was the three flights of stairs and no luggage  help and $25.00 for a second car and no sign for the door to keep the maid out and my TV stop working right in the middle of my movie first thing in the morning and that sucked. It was beautiful to be so near the beach though. The man in the morning was nice and gave me an extra half hour so lug all my stuff up the three flights of stairs though. Much nicer then the women the night of check in who made me wait to check in instead of asking her caller to hold. Doubt I will stay there again.</Text>

The door to the room had to be slammed to actually shut and lock, cleanliness was a issue with the bathroom being the main culprit. Someone else’s hair was still left over in the shower/bathtub and the wall next to the toilet had some bugs burrowing into the room. When we reported this issue they sent maintenance over and they just slapped some spackle over the holes, naturally the bug was working his way back out by the evening.

The room was spacious and the location is nice, but they need to work on some things.</text>

<username>Tegan Fellows</username><time>1570828212906< /time><rate>3< /rate><Text>This place ticks pretty much all of the boxes, I'd say I like it, but it's nothing extra.
The location is it's best feature, and in fairness the beds felt like I was for real sleeping on God's own personal cloud.
But I thinks it's price is way too much, especially when it's not offering a breakfast. There was coffee served from 8am, but coffees no bacon bap is it?

I was in a bottom story balcony and the house from the street doesn't irritate at all, so that's a bonus.

Decent enough place though lads<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808e402ecc84593d:0x6394f41fdfd89955</Gmap_id></record>

Awesome place, good price, on the beach with an ocean view if available, nice rooms with awesome remodeled bathrooms, but best of all the customer service is ultimately why I would recommend this place to all who travel, I will definitely be staying here the next time I visit.< /review>

This motel is under construction, and they started Hammering at 7am. The room had been remodeled, but was not done well. The bathroom sink drained in to the floor, and we only had bath towels, no hand towels or washcloths. It was in a good location.< /text>

<Review>Location was great. Parking is terrible and very limited. Room service and desk employees were scarce and hard to track down. They padlocked the gates at the end of the night, leaving ONE way in and out. There was a huge violent fight with another group during our stay and the first responders couldn't even get in without using bolt cutters.</Review>< pics>

<review>Staff are friendly and helpful, views are nice since it's one of the few inns on the beach. But everything else is awful! Room was dirty, needs a paint job, spider webs, broken wood, loud AC, dirty filter, dirty furniture, etc...the room looked like a shelter, 2x2 metres, dirty floors, ice bucket from the dollar store, non matching glasses, it was a nightmare. I told the staff that I didn't like the room but they said there's no solution for that one night. The management must be so distracted not noticing how bad the situation is. I wouldn't pay 1/4 of what I paid and I would get much better value in other cities like San Jose or San Francisco. Believe it or not, I got a suite in a 5-stars chain for a lower price and higher end service. I would never recommend this place to anyone, would definitely pay more and go to Dream Inn if I had known. I was told that some rooms were renovated, that's why you might see a mix in reviews. But if you get an older room then you're screwed, this is false advertising for me.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

< review>
Read the reviews before you book!!! By far the worst hotel I ever stayed at. At $300 a night this hotel is a joke. This is not a 4 star hotel, more like 2 1/2. We got the room with a queen bed and a couch pull out bed with 2 rooms and only one room has the ac so its impossible to cool the other room. Rooms are very old and have not been updated for a while. This place is very dirty. Floors are so dirty that you feet/ socks become black is you stand on them without shoes. We thought that during daily room service the floors would be mopped but no, when we came back the rooms was tidy but floors were still filthy. Blinds are different size then the windows. The sink is in the master bedroom? Pull out bed sheets were dirty so we had to request new ones. The only good thing about this hotel is the location right across the street from the beach and boardwalk.<//review>

<Text>Really loved this place! Walking distance to the beach (several stairs though). I stayed in a family room with a small kitchen, bathroom and nice couch area with a TV, and a large bed. It was clean, well stocked, and comfortable. It was also a much better price than others in the area.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>Room #27 was a mess. Hair on the towels, use bandaid in the extra blanket. Bed and pullout bed were messy and dirty. The whole hotel is under renovation, and it looks like that means all hospitality effort has stopped as well. Would not stay here again.<//review><Date>1582352336153</Date>< UserId.>

<review>Got locked out of my room at 6am when I went out to grab a drink from the vending machines since the rooms card reader stopped working. No one answered the emergency hotel line and the front desk was closed. Waited in my car until the front desk worker came into work. Denied my request for a refund completely, was told I’d receive an email regarding what happened and why no one answered the “emergency” hotel line.</review>< Date>

<Text>Horrible place to stay, Holiday weekend and my daughter's Bday. Almost 3 hours late getting our room on a Saturday with a 4 pm check in. Yes this ruined dinner and evening plans waiting to get into our room. And then the filthy floors, no towels, ants everywhere hot water takes 15 min in the morning what else. Do yourself and wife and family a favor find somewhere else.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I love the place but cleaning service was disappointing. We stayed in unit 22 on 07/20/2019. We left our room at 10:30am and the cleaning ladies were finishing the room next door. We hung the sign for service on the door handle as we said hi to the cleaning ladies and they said hi back. We get back from the beach full of sand and ready for a shower and see the sign on the floor and our room not cleaned and in need of towels. I find it too peculiar.</review>

<Review>A family vacation was planned were about 19 of us decided to stayed at Casablanca Inn. As each party showed up, the staff greeted us all with such a welcoming attitude. With such a big family, we booked 7 rooms in total, and each one was newly remodeled with great decor. Everyone in our group commented on how nice the rooms were..especially the view from the suite and the rooms located right outside the boardwalk. Easy access to everything. It was an over all enjoyable and relaxing stay. All 19 of us agreed that we will all be back for another family vacation.< /Review>< Pics>

This was my second time at this hotel and I enjoyed our time, once again. This time I chose to come here to surprise my friend to celebrate her recent engagement. The receptionist made sure I was put in a room with a great ocean view and let me check in a few hours earlier than allowed so I could decorate the room. Besides the construction noise that started and ended at a respectful time, I once again enjoyed Casablanca. Its become my go to place when I want to stay close to the beach. Thanks Casablanca!< /review>

General place was nice but overall cleanliness was very poor. Stains on pillows, cobwebs on the walls and vents and also no water in the room or in the soda machine and at night on a monday in Santa Cruz everything closes super early and there's no way I'm drinking water out of the faucet sink.</review>

<review>Room was nice, Hotel equally nice the location perfect, overall the hotel is a 2 star at best not a 4 star as advertised, However for my wife's birthday I paid for a room we checked in about 5 pm  after a long drive we just wanted a nice "Hot" shower , to our surprise we had no hot water so we phoned the front desk and the clerk came to our room to check it out confirmed there was no hot water but stated it was a new system and he would alert maintenance, He stated it would be fixed in a few hours.

Later that night about 5 hours later we again tried to shower still no Hot water we called the front desk again and were assured it would be hot in the morning.

Morning comes and still not hot water again we call and a different clerk sends maintenance man who confirms no Hot water.

So upon check out we asked for some type of compensation for we paid almost $300.00 for the night and the amenities should at least cover hot water we were told we would have to talk to the manager , that was done and the manager stated they don't compensate for only having cold water.

My advice this is very poor business practice , I would avoid at all cost<//review></record>

We booked this hotel a month and a half before our arrival because it was across the street from the beach and the room we reserved could accommodate our adult family of four with the room description of:  "Family Suite
Description: Sleeps six comfortably - Private King Bed and Queen bedrooms, a Queen Sofa Bed, a full kitchen along with a dining area. Guests have access to two bathrooms including one tub."  We got there and our room was not ready.  They took our number and told us they'd call us when the room was ready.  They did not call us on the phone number they asked us for.  We checked in and went to our room to find an open room with 2 queen beds and two camper like seats that "could be" used as beds, I guess and only one bathroom.  When we went to tell the desk clerk that we received the wrong room, he stated that this has happened before and he would refund our money.  What?  We just want the room we paid for.  We were told that is not an option as they had given "that" room to someone else and the owner/management have now categorized this new open room as a family suite even though the description does not come close to what we booked.  They had another room available (a king bed with a pull out couch) but instead of offering that to us in addition to what we had they told us that we could switch to that room but could not have it in addition to the room they were trying to give us. I pointed out that if they gave us that additional room, we would then have the 2 queen beds, king bed and 2 baths we had paid for but we were told that they would not do that for us.  They did nothing to try to accommodate us.  I will never go to this hotel again and I urge everyone reading reviews to reconsider this hotel.  We ended up going to the Paradox Autograph Collection Hotel and really enjoyed it!  Not on the beach but the accommodations made up for that.<//text>

If you want stay at a place with some history you must try Casablanca Inn.  Love the place.  Old but clean.  Very comfy beds and the Views are to die for.  Staff very accommodating.  And a plus for us is it is a pet friendly place.</Review>

<Review>I would give this place 0 stars but the location is amazing. My husband and I stayed at this hotel in one of their "remodeled" rooms. Wasn't as great as we expected especially for the price. The front desk girl Carla I believe was her name? she has tattoos was very rude and sarcastic.. she has a really nasty attitude, and every time we needed assistance with room malfunctions she would say i don't know and that it wasn't her problem because she wasn't getting paid enough other guests that were staying there were also mentioning her rudeness. the manager should really consider hiring new staff especially since they already have some bad reviews about the hotel itself. really sad that such a nice location and beautiful historical structure has really inconsiderate staff... :/ would of loved to come back to casablanca but because of my experience my husband and I will stick to dream inn.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

For an older hotel it's nice and always one of my first choices... has history and soul.. not the fanciest , but for an old mansion converted into a hotel I'd say it's better than most... and the rooms are pretty clean I'd say. Love the big suite with fireplace, just like an old school mansions master bedroom. The balcony overlooking the beach and boardwalk is always nice too.. stayed here a few times and will probably stay more</text>

Real nice place. Great vantage point from the hotel. Be careful of slamming door on the second floor. Otherwise I really like the Terra cotta tile and the old Spanish walls. My kids and I would love to stay again!</text>

< review>
We had nothing but positive experiences when staying with Casablanca Inn. We booked a family room (One king bed & a pull out) for myself, my boyfriend and best friend. When we arrived at 9pm, exhausted from a huge drive, they upgraded us at no extra cost to an ocean view room with two queen beds. The rooms were clean, well presented and had a beautiful view of the beach. The front desk staff were extremely helpful, knowledgeable and lovely to speak with. The following day they offered us a late check out which was really convenient for us. After our departure, we realized we had left some medication in the room, after I called up and spoke with Will at the front desk, they agreed to mail it out to us as we were already 3.5 hours away. I received a phone call from Brian the day after confirming that he had express posted it out to us to make sure it arrived in time before we flew back home to Australia. I have never received such positive service from a hotel before. They truly went above & beyond to make sure I was happy and I am so appreciative. I highly recommend their services for anyone staying in Santa Cruz as it is a short walk from the boardwalk and close to plenty of shops. Thanks again guys, we won't forget it!!</review>

< review>
Family room with one king bed, one bathroom and one pull out couch, sink in the bedroom, microwave and hotel refrigerator.  Stayed 4 nights wish it had been one. The floors were so filthy we used soap and paper towels on our hands and knees to clean. The paper towels were black. We spent 2 hours cleaning floors, walls, baseboards, doors and faucet handles.  When we pulled out the bed for our daughter to sleep hairs all over the sheets.  So, we asked the desk clerk to look at it and were told,  "oh that just comes out of the dryer they are clean." I had to request clean sheets.  There is no way we would ever recommend this place or stay again. Oh, and when I asked for a broom and dust pan they couldn't find a dust pan I was  given one that a child might use to pretend playing house. We paid over $400.00 a night.</review>

<review>Just stayed here last weekend 3/22 to 3/24.  No ocean view with family rooms.  Coffee available not breakfast.  Construction during multiple days and even asked to come into our room to screw holes.  We allowed them but our baby was sleeping and inconvienent.  Maybe,
they shouldn't have rented the room.  We left early and now I have tried to get a receipt calling a lot of different times but no answer or I get hung up on.  I would never want to stay here again!<//review>< Pictures>

The location & charm of this hotel is great. The bed was comfy. The view perfect! The decorations nice. Sadly the bathroom smelt like urine on arrival & even worse when I wet one of their towels & wiped around the floor by the toilet the towel picked up both blood, urine & dirt! Absolutely unacceptable & for that... Ill pay an extra $100 & stay else where. How could I possibly recommend a hotel to a friend who could potentially pick up aids here?!?</text>

When we arrived the front desk clerk was a bit confused and flustered.  We got checked in and the room and view was beautiful.  It really has the most amazing location ever.  The beds were not comfortable but we figured we'd sacrifice for that amazing view.  When we tried to check out there was not anyone we could talk to.  We waited about 10 minutes and finally just turned our keys in.  I was wanting our receipt but we needed to get on the road.
My husband left something in the room so we started calling them to see if they found it.  The number that is listed, nobody answers it and there isn't a way for you to leave a message.  Also, they did not respond to the email that we sent.  When finally the room charges came through they were higher than what we booked on Travelocity.  I contacted them and they were unable to speak with anyone at this hotel. Big surprise!  And they directed me to try myself.  Not cool Travelocity. Which I've tried again but I'm sure you know the outcome of this.
So, if you only care about the view and not good beds or accurate prices or any sort of customer service then go ahead and stay at the Casablanca Inn.</text>

<review>Family room is good value for money. Stunning view of the sunrise over the pier from room 16. Very cosy decorated rooms and really cool design bathroom. Even the complimentary shampoo and conditioner were soon nice, all natural and organic. A bit funny smell when we entered but think it's just their choice of cleaning soap.<//review>< pictures>

It is a decent hotel with a great view. The area can be a bit loud at night so if you are a light sleeper bring ear plugs. You are seconds from the beach and there is great food nearby.< /text>

They didn't bother to sweep the floor or even clean my sheets. My feet were black with dust after walking around the room and the architecture was horrid. Btw my window had a perfect view of a fence(yes just a fence) The pictures online look nice but don't be fooled, the door in the lobby doesn't even open for Christ's sake don't make my mistake and waste your money< /text>

Good hotel, great view onto the beach, pleasantly surprised for the prove we paid. Room was ok, by far not the worst but pretty average except for the view. Didn't have a safe which is quite rare these days. Definitely noticed not there as we where travelling with passports and cameras etc. Price was okay, pretty average, not great. Would stay again but be prepared its good, but not amazing. Works were being done when we were there, so would like to go back and see the renovations!</text>

A small and cozy hotel right on the beach. Quiet and beautiful views. Check in is a little late at 4pm. Also if your a burger and fries type of person would not recommend the Thai restaurant in the hotel.< /review>

This is the second time we have stayed at the Casa Blanca and it only got better.  We had an ocean view room and it was great.  Truly the best view and easy access to the everything.  The private guest only restaurant and bar are a nice added bonus.< /review>

The room was a good size (we had oceanfront King), but it was also dated and we felt a little uncomfortable. The air conditioning unit was very noisy and we heard a lot of outside noise in the room. However the location couldn't have been better, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the view from the balcony off the lobby is stunning. Although we didn't need it, having a little kitchenette was a nice bonus too. Might stay here again, but would definitely reevaluate expectations before hand.</review>< pics>

The view from  balcony was nice but the standard of cleanliness made me so depressed that I didn't want to spend even one night. The board walk and beach was just a few steps away from The hotel. Very pricey as compared to the location of room and service.< /Text>< pictures>

This place is definitely not worth $259 a night. This place is not putting money into renovations like they should. Our bathroom was disgusting.  Oh did I mention it was our honeymoon. The picture's online are no were close to what it really is . The owner should really think about just fixing it and making it cleanier and your customers would write better reviews and want to come back . Why don't you take a walk in the rooms and underneath the sinks to see the horror of the dirtiness that lies within.</review>

Right across from the beach and just down a bit from the pier... pet friendly... the place is charmingly quaint but aged and in need of a bit of TLC. The drag are all the obnoxious vagrants dominating the entire Santa Cruz beach walk area. Don't even attempt an after dark stroll on the beach. I doubt I'll ever visit Santa Cruz again.< /text>

This place was rough. Everything was outdated and in need of repair. Our door didn't lock properly and the room was pretty sketch. The photos that the hotel has posted do not accurately represent the current state of the hotel, take a look at the ones I've posted.

Another issue was that there weren't enough parking spaces for everyone. We left our spot to go out for dinner and when we came back there was none available.

Continental breakfast includes breakfast bars, coffee, orange juice, brownies, and some rotten fruit.

About the only thing good about this hotel is the location. Next time, I would stay further from the beach and get a decent place.< /text>

Wonderful night. Amazing view of the beach and pier. Walking distance to the restaurant we had dinner at. Only thing keeping this from being 5 stars is that it wasnt updated and the breakfast wasn't what I expected for a $200 night stay. Breakfast was bread, croissants, and yogurt with orange juice and coffee. Which was good, just less than expected. Also, being outdated really was nothing big. Bed and room was beautiful and comfortable.</text>

<rating>2<//rating><review>Would be a 1 Star but the location was great.  We arrived early to see if we could get an early check-in and they said they would call.  Five hours later and 45 minutes after we could check-in and still no call.  We came back to the hotel and waited 25 minutes in line behind 2 people to check in.

There is also $100 charge on my card from them that I wasn’t told about.  I’ve called 3 times today all roughly 30 minutes apart and no one answers and there’s no answering machine.

The room itself was soaked in cleaning solution when we went in and the smell stayed the entire time we were there.  There was also an inch gap between the front door and ground (room 11) that I threw pillows in front of to make sure nothing came in.

There is also no breakfast or pool, which is fine but one lady was angry because she was under the impression there would be.< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
We booked a room weeks in advanced for our California trip and this hotel gave away our room. We found this out when we arrived after a 4 hour drive. Last minute, we had to find a different hotel in order to accommodate our family. They were not helpful nor willing to assist us. Very low rent and extremely rude employees. I would give zero stars, if I could.</Review>

Beautiful view of the ocean. Spacious room and very clean. I would definitely stay here again.However, the shower drained slowly and water began ponding in the shower basin and the TV remote wouldnt control the volume; couldnt figure it out and didnt make time to contact staff on either issue. My bad.< /text>

The rooms are awesome with a bed little table and a kitchenette.. as in ful fridge, stove, oven and microwave. So you can actually grab some food and cook it in your room if you want.. or have some better options of reheating your left overs. The staff here are great and very accommodating. The location can't be beat either.. It's across the street from the beach and boardwalk. I had a room facing the boardwalk with a balcony with a great view of the beach. It was nice and cozy and well worth the price I paid</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Great stay in a large Suite with kitchen and newly renovated private balcony (it's huge!)... could not beat the view!  Our room was clean, very comfortable bed and the staff was nice and helpful.  If we ever visit Santa Cruz again, we will be back to the Casablanca!  Thank you for having rooms available for us with such last minute notice!< /Review>

The rooms are cheesy and not exactly what I expected, but I DID pay the price just to be able to sleep super close to the beach. The room was cute, clean, comfy bed. Small bathroom and small kitchen, but it was an interesting add on. We checked in about 8 pm and was greeted by a nice guy, who gave us advice on local eating and was very helpful. He made the check in quick as well and answered any questions we had. The room had the most amazing fans so it was easy to keep cool and there was definitely enough toiletries and such for us. Loved it! I definitely feel like I got exactly what I paid for, something cute small and nice with a great location.<//text>

Stay here if you still believe Elvis is alive or liked the Smurfs so much you'd like to see what the village was like. The rooms are clean, but.... as others posted, it looks nothing like the pictures of airy bright rooms. It's small, outdated and run down. Dude, there's a *Tube* TV!!. 1980 LIVES!. PS, shower is clean and hot... but if anyone in another room flushes, you'll get 3rd degree burns. if they use hot water, you'll freeze. Make it a quickie! This was a Hotwire booking for their 3.5. I'll complain there next. Total disappointment.<//Text>

For 30+ years we have been staying here for mothers day weekend, but when we went to book our room this year they were so overpriced we said for get it.  We are brokenhearted for the end of a family tradition.  We understand prices go up, but TRIPLE !<//review>

My overall stay this past weekend 8/31/12-9/3/12 was horrible. The rooms were horrible!! The sheets had holes in them, they were ripped on the sides, and they were wrinkled. The bathroom door didn't shut all the way and the tub had mold in the corners. The fridge was really loud at night, the microwave didn't work at all. Then to top it all off my boyfriend went downstairs to get some ice and the lady at the front desk said "she was all out of tokens, but it takes quarters." I don't care about the money part I care more about the fact that she didn't care that a paying customer had to pay extra for ice. One last thing, the lady that i made my reservation with did not tell me that our balcony was shared with two other rooms, She told me that it was the honeymoon suite and it was very romantic. She couldn't have been more far off!  If I had to go back to Santa Cruz I would rather stay further away and have better rooms and service then stay close to the beach.
On the bright side the restaurant was very good!!!</Text>

<text>For the amount of money it cost to have an ocean view and the only way you could get that is to open your door and look at it is not what I consider somebody should pay extra money forToo many stairs for someone with disabilities or just the comfort of taking your luggage up and down.The room itself had nowhere to put your bathroom stuff on a pedestal sinkOne cabinet to share between the beds which you could not reach so you could not put your drink or anything down on it and be able to reach it from badOne little bitty mirror in the whole place I could go on and on would not stay there again was planning on staying 2 nights and left after the firstThe good thing is we did have a patio we share with 3 other rooms that if we wanted to sit out at the table out there then we had a nice little View<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>We have stayed here twice now and there is one main point the negative reviewers keep forgetting to mention: **affordable** views.  That, and kind/competent staff, is what brought us back to the Casablanca.

The Casablanca has the absolute best location and views on the beach.  If you don't believe me, ask them to take a look at room 15A, which is where we spent the better part of last week (3/23/15-3/26/15).  From our room, we could see everything from Lighthouse Field State Beach, to the Municipal Wharf, to the Boardwalk, and all beaches, volleyball courts and palm trees in-between.  We actually went to the grocery store every day so we could have dinner in our room and watch the sunset every night because we couldn't think of anywhere in town we would have such a panoramic view.  Plus, we didn't have to take a second mortgage on our house to be able to stay here and do this.

This mansion is over 100 years old, and we personally witnessed all the upgrades the new owners are currently doing.  We originally requested the room we had last summer (#5, which is right above the beach and was absolutely fabulous), but the whole string of rooms along Beach Street, plus all the bungalows along Main Street, have been gutted and are at the end stages of a complete remodel.  Knowing we definitely wanted another view room, we were offered a few different choices, in a few different price ranges, and we were amazed at the room we received for a price that was about $30 more a night than a comparable room down the road that would've been facing the freeway.

The old saying, "You get what you pay for" doesn't apply at the Casablanca, because you get so much more.  For a very comfortable price, we had a clean room with a lovely kitchen, a fireplace nook and breathtaking views.

We will never stay anywhere else in Santa Cruz.  The Casablanca has become our home away from home.

My husband and I only have one regret about this place - we can't move in.< /Review>< response>

It was nice for the price ($168) for a king with ocean view. They were in the middle of renovation which was fine with me since I didn't spend much time in my room anyways. I did have an issue with a very disruptive and drunk guest. I called the desk to inform them on his smoking that could be smelt from my room. He continued his behavior and when we complained again the young lady at the desk was very nice and moved us to a different room. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is ok with some renovation noise. The view is amazing, the staff was very nice and the location is perfect.</review>

We only stayed one night but loved it there.  The room was clean and the décor fit the location, beachy. Lots of steps to transfer our luggage from the provided free parking to our room so if you want a room right at the strand then make sure you are okay with carrying your luggage or pack lite. Shower was a little cramped and no tub, was kinda hoping for a Jacuzzi either in the room or outside (long days of traveling and it would have been a nice way to unwind).  Staff was very nice when available (nobody there when we checked out).<//review>< rating>

I reserved a room here for my significant other and I to celebrate our anniversary on 10/11-10/12/14. When I initially checked in, they did not have my reservation in their system - which wasn't a big deal we just went off to explore the premises while they sorted everything out.

They found a room for us, which we moved all our luggage to. The room they  provided was significantly different from what I had paid for. I went back to the front desk to request a room matching the description I paid for - even pointing out the specific amenities lacking which were GUARANTEED. They told me they were all booked so they could not move us. I then requested a refund since the room did not match the description. They told me their cancellation policy prevented them from refunding me, and I would be charged the full amount.

Wrong room. No refund. Never again.<//Text>

This hotel look so new, clean and fancy in photos but it is far from it in reality. We booked an ocean view room which seems to be the one always shown in advertising. Upon arrival I was shocked at how old the building is. The entire place needs a clean up. Garden beds full of dirt with nothing planted in them. The steps down to the footpath are covered in what looks like vomit stains, chewing gum and filth.
The reception doorway had heaps of blowflies buzzing around and the reception desk had a big vase of dead flowers with stagnant yellow water in it. Not a great first impression. The lady working there was very nice. I asked to use the restroom in the foyer and it was filthy. I didn't want to touch anything.
Upon entering the room we were shocked at how old it was, there was dirt all over the floor and it stuck to our bare feet. We had to wipe them with a towel every time before we got into bed. Everything was very old and run down and we paid a high price for the room. I would not recommend this to anyone. I am giving it 2 stars because the 3 staff we met were lovely and the WIFI was reliable.< /review>

Great location and neat old building but the new workmanship is done poorly and our ocean front room was actually a shared patio with three other guests ;(. You could hear the ocean all night which was nice but I could also hear all neighboring conversations. The bed was very comfortable but the breakfast was weak. We wouldn't stay again.</Text>

<Review>We booked for a King with Ocean view. We got their around 11:am July 05, 2015 and paid extra 25 dollars, all worth it than waiting till 3:00 PM. The receptionist was really nice and was talking to my BF and she gave us an upgrade which is a studio with ocean view. We are pretty happy with the room. The streets were pretty noisy, people walking and talking loud but then it quit down at night. So Monday morning dump truck is pretty loud and wake us up. Then we are about ready to close our eyes somebody was lighting the fireworks around 10. pm to 11:00 pm. Over all I gave 5 stars because we got the upgrade room and enjoy the private balcony.</Review>< pics>

<Text>The rooms show their age and badly need to undergo renovation. Not happy with the cleanliness of the rooms. We found few strands of hair on our sheets(which definitely did not belong to anyone in my room). Was disappointed for the amount of money we paid for the hotel. One positive aspect is the location of the hotel which is really good.</Text>< Pics>

Housekeeping ripped us off! The Hotel staff did nothing, not even a call from manager as requested. Came back to room and we were locked out. Had to wait outside in cold till someone from another hotel could open our room. Room was not as advertised, nothing like pictures. Stay at own risk,  no safes...housekeeping will go through your bags.< /text>

<Review>Casablanca is a great place to stay at! The staff is very friendly. We stayed here for one night on our way to LA and loved it. It’s right next to the beach, restaurants, theme park and pier and just a 5 minute walk to a surfing beach. The rooms have a beautiful mediterranean decor and are very clean. There’s a fully equipped kitchenette and cute dining table. High quality organic soaps are offered in the bathrooms too. Very recommended!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

The website looked great and we got a room, even though the price was very expensive. We showed up and we had a standard, instead of a king. The room was the size of an office at best, maybe 6 ft by 8ft. Very cheap looking compared to the pictures online. Office staff went to fix our room assignment and they were booked but we would still be paying a lot for that tiny room. We decided it was not worth the price and left. If it was cheaper yes, but not for that price! Stay somewhere nice instead for a big price, away from the shore.<//Text>

< review>
Paid for ocean view didnt get, super old, ice growing half way down the inside of the frig 4 different locks on the door. Mold growing in the grout on the counter. On a super steep hill not enough parking. I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE. High priced for something super old We could have stayed at a Hilton for less and probably had a better view we looked out at a rotting building across the street. I have never in my life been so screwed over on our reservations and paid such a high rate for a dumpy room. Also could see light from a crack in the door to the tiny balcony that look at the empty rotting building across the street. The bathroom was half way descent like look the tried to remodeled it. Bed was OK thats all I can say good about it.</review>

King ocean view room was small and alittle dusty, but had the  best view.. No private balcony even tho it did say balcony on the sight we booked on. Im assuming the queen rooms with a partial ocean view have them. The Tai restaurant attached to it was such a treat with spectacular views also. Make sure u ask 4 extra towels our room had only 1.< /Text>

<text>CAREFUL... they CANCELLED my CONFIRMED reservation.

On 9/1/2015 I made a hotel reservation by phone with Casablanca Inn calling "Eden" at the front desk directly.  They took my VISA numbers and CONFIRMED my reservation by email and letterhead contract on that same day.

On 9/3/2015 at 6:14pm a desk clerk "Will" left a voicemail saying that there was a problem.  I called back and he said I had been quoted incorrect rates.  I explained that I had already made plans, that I had an agreement with them and I expected them to honor it.  He told me his manager said that they would not honor the reservation.

Incredulous at being treated this way, I asked to speak to a manager.  A manager "Rupesh" finally called me at 7pm on 9/4/2015 and left a voice message saying my reservation was cancelled.

On 9/5/2015, the day of my reservation, after calling three times I finally got through to another manager who reiterated they would not honor the reservation.

This is an outrageous abuse of the hotel reservation system. Hotel Casablanca does NOT HONOR their confirmed contract.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>The Inn is very run down, every hallway is infested with flies and they advertise rooms with ocean views that require a door facing a public balcony to be open to the room, totally destroying any privacy. The walls are paper thin and the guests were, honestly, pretty rough around the edges. The only thing that kept it from getting one star was that the younger staff is friendly and accommodating.  I would never stay there again, though.<//Text>< Date>

I very much enjoyed our stay at the Casablanca Inn.

The room had been recently renovated, and was very comfortable, and the staff was very friendly and helpful, directing us to a couple of very good restaurants.

The Inn is also very convenient to the waterfront, just a few steps away.</Review>

Other than location the hotel is not up to the mark. The room linens were not clean and rooms were still unclean. Small and narrow bathroom not well maintained. The TV was not working in one of the room. In our vacation this hotel was the highly priced  and the worst stay.</review>

<Text>Sawasdee by the sea is a really good addition to the Casablanca Inn. Really good Thai food, excellent Thai iced tea, and friendly staff.

If you're at the boardwalk or by Main Beach you should definitely stop in for a bite and a drink!</Text>< pics>

Ripped me off, upgraded to smaller room and charged more then refused to put back to our original room booked.  Reyna the manager refused to refund money and left us waiting on lobby.  Total rip off, ruined our vacation while I was recovering from surgery, don't stay there<//review>

My experience was terrible.  For the prices they charge to say they have no installed air conditioning and the rooms were old smelling and dirty.  They should be ashamed of themselves for such awful customer service.  They seemed used to complaints because it just rolled off their backs like "oh well" another complaint... I do not recommend.</text>

<review>I stayed one night at the Casa Blanca Hotel. They gave me a room that I didn't book. The gentlemen that helped me at the front counter raised his voice at me and told me they didn't have the any ocean rooms with a King Size Bed. He put me in a room where the TV didn't work nor did the coffee pot. Reyna the Hotel Manager seems to think it is ok to yell at customers, lie to customers and still have them pay full price. She told me she has no authority and she has to check with general manager for approval and will call me. When as you would guess, she never called. So, I will continue to hunt down the owners of the hotel to discuss with them how their 5 million dollar hotel is being handled. I would not recommend staying at this hotel. There are several hotels in the same vicinity at the same price and some lower. So it anyone out there knows who the owners are and can tell me how to get in contact with them, I'd really appreciate it. When I received such poor service, I did look at reviews and saw how many people were treated the same way by the poor management. What a shame to let such a expensive piece of property be managed so bad.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>This was the most disgusting, dirty hotel I've ever stayed in. I paid $328. for one night in a room that still had used Q-tips on the floor and dirty toilet from the previous customers, dirty floors, cramped room nothing like the photos, walkways to the restaurant smelled like urine and not at all the "beachy" bar and grill shown in the photo. The place is run-down and there's garbage and old signs and boards all over the roof-top area viewed from the balcony. After viewing my room, I tried to cancel my reservation and the girl at the front desk said it was my tough luck and would be charged anyway. I'm glad I took photos because my description doesn't do it justice. I booked through Expedia. I won't trust them again.<//review>< pics>

Most terrible hotel experience ever!  First, they gave us a queen room, even though I had a reservation for king  suite with ocean view directly booked on their website. The guy at the front desk kept asking me whether the queen bed was enough for us. Seriously? Second, there was no bath towels. And I went to the front desk and asked for both towels and the guy at the front desk gave me one. And I asked for another one (we are a family of 4) and the front desk guy got so angry and punched the door! If this is not insulting enough, we were literally locked out for half an hour after we came back from the boardwalk at night.  The front desk had no staff for half an hour. Nobody answered the phone. When there was finally someone, we were given different key cards and asked to try and try over and over again. After 5 failed attempts, the front desk guy finally went to check the key card himself. Yes, it worked! Turned out you have to lift the door handle upward, instead of downward as most hotel doors do, after you slide the card. I don't actually know whom to blame for this one. Maybe it is so simple. we are too undereducated for this fancy hotel door. A positive note, the next morning when we checked out, we were offered a $30 refund for all the inconvenience. Looks like they do care about their guests' stay. Maybe it is just the issue with one rude staff.<//text>

<review>Well we were not sure about staying here since the reviews were about 50/50.  With that said if I was the housekeeping supervisor I would hire all new staff.  The ceiling fans had not been cleaned in probably a year and the sofa bed my kids had to sleep on, we noticed during the second night while folding out the bed, that the bottom of the mattress was covered in mold. There was about 1/4 in of dust & fuzzies on top of all the door jams.  They allow dogs and you could tell that evidently the dog had used the carpet as its bathroom.  Our curtains were ripped half way down and I had to use my hair clips to hold them shut at night. There was cheetos on the kitchen floor which were from someone that stayed there before us.  The chair and couch were so dirty that i did not even want to sit on them.  Will not stay here again!<//review><Rate>1< /Rate>< user_id>

Dined at the restaurant's main dinning floor; they also have a restaurant / bar on the first floor; food was better than expected; prices are fair but portions are small; however, we ordered the same number of plates as we do at other Thai restaurants and we were full.< /Review>

I made a reservation for a room with a window looking over the Monterey Bay for October 4th. I did this because the Santa Cruz Wharf is having a 100th anniversary and there will be fireworks. I get a phone call that wakes me up from sleep from Casablanca at 11:00 at night on Sept 6th asking me why I haven't checked in. I explained that I had a reservation for Oct 4th. The man who called me hung up on me and when I tried to call back no one answered. I check my credit card online the next day to see if I have been charged for the room and they have not only charged me they charged me $267 when I was told the room was $239. Get a kick out of this: When I was initially making the reservation I was told that my dog could stay overnight if I paid an additional $25 that would only be charged if I arrived with him. Well even though I wasn't there when they said I was supposed to be there they are also charging my credit card for the $25 pet fee. Casablanca says that they sent me an email that confirmed the date for Sept  (I ask them why, someone like myself who lives in the same county as Casablanca would want a room there if it wasn't for this special event which I also explained to the clerk who took my reservation) but I have no record of that! So I ask them to send me a copy and I was told that they could not. I am of course going through hoops with the B of A credit card division and am told they cannot do anything until the charge is no longer pending. I would highly advise you to Not give Casablanca your credit card number and for goodness sake, do Not make a reservation with them.<//Text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Arrived and within an hour the boiler broke, and the hotel was without water.. No flushing, no water for showering or for washing hands.  I asked them how long, he said he did not know.  I asked the front desk if I could speak to a senior employee, or manager, he said he could not give that info out..WTF  I had 3 kids, and no water.  I asked to check out, but he said I could not have a refund...THhs is crazy..The hotel also has a strange odor, but that may because the pipes are old, and the boiler was broken, and no one could flush.  Horrible service, as the phone did not work and the staff was rude. This my first review that I have ever written that has been negative, but this is crazy...DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!!!!<//review>< resp>

Way over priced and under serviced.Not worth $560 per night.Fireplace chimney had animals scratching its surface all night long.when I complained the next day, I was told this is normal.I said why the chimney has not been capped off for safety,the response was silent and stupid like its owners and operators.<//Review>

Wir waren für eine Nacht im Casablanca on the Beach und waren sehr zufrieden mit der Unterkunft. Wir bekamen ein frisch renoviertes Zimmer mit Meerblick und bequemem King-Size-Bett. Das Zimmer war eigentlich mit allem Nötigen ausgestattet - evtl. wäre ein Stuhl sowie eine Ablagemöglichkeit im Bad noch praktisch gewesen - aber das sind Details. Das Personal war super freundlich.Die Verpflegung war in unserem Arragement nicht inklusive, jedoch hat es gleich nebenan ein sehr gutes Thai-Restaurant und nur wenige Gehminuten vom Hotel entfernt haben wir in einem kleinen Café ein wirklich gutes Frühstück für wenig Geld erhalten.  Parkplätze waren genug vorhanden und im Übernachtungspreis inbegriffen. Wir würden das Casablanca on the Beach ohne Weiteres weiterempfehlen und auch selbst jederzeit wieder buchen.<//Text>

The room is comftable and very nice. The main oroblem in eoom number 1-6 is that the light is shining into the room. A better light protection whould be nice.</Review>

La recepcionista a pesar de haberle dicho que teníamos equipaje pesado no nos proporcionó habitación en planta baja y siempre tuvimos que acarrear las maletas por escaleras. La habitación con puerta de vidrio expuesta al paso de la gente, sin intimidad, sin caja de seguridad, las paredes parecían de papel, pudiendo escucharse todo tipo de ruidos. Al lado de un restaurante tailandés con el ruido consiguiente.<//text>

<Review>They make up their own prices on the parts. The owner is a joke and so is his son. They’re both very rude and don’t care about the customer either way. They have a very “were better then you and we don’t need your business anyway” attitude. The owner would rather junk stuff then sell it for a cheaper price. Worst customer service. The entire experience there is laughable.</Review><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x809466d096980009:0x59a2a4256f75519e</gmapID>< pictures>

<review>Only thing holding this place from being great is the sorry excuse for a "warranty" they offer. 10% for a 30 "warranty" and that "warranty" is good for a 1 time exchange. If after that exchange doesnt work out, there goes your money.</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

This was my first time here, the entrance was a bit confusing as to where it was but the security officer helped point the direction, which was very helpful. Admission was $2.00, not bad really, they searched our bags upon entering and then stamped our hands and in we went. The place is very well kept, no junk on the walk paths to trip over or go through your shoe, they keep things picked up. There are many workers around the grounds so I imagine if you had a question they could help, we were lucky and found what we needed within the first few minutes we were there. We went and paid and were offered the option to purchase a warranty for the parts we bought, which I thought was amazing. Considering that it is a junkyard, it was a very good experience. We will return here whenever another used part is needed.<//review>

What an evil company !!!  If i can give ZERO star I will.  They will rip you off however they can.  They will offer you warranty then when you try to return to get credit (not even a refund like any other wrecking yard like pick n pull), they will mention you if you bought the warranty. If you didn't guess what, they just raped your butt.  I bought couple doors from them, NOT EVEN an hour i came back i wanted to switch my door hinges.  They still want to charge $10 dollars for warranty to exchange the parts that I just took off right in front of them.  I made the wrong move on getting the wrong door hinges out.  They don't care to listen but i got raped by them.  Guess what people, they charge $16 a piece to door hinges. Not like any others wreckers which they have two separate prices for complete door with hinges or not.  But they will charge you separately and $64 dollars for 2 doors and $128 dollars extra if you buy 4 doors which is complete rip off. they should try to work with customers but their customer service is just way below par. The ladies who works there, blaming on the business practice they do but no body works with customer even help at all.  Even the security guys who stands there doing nothing, they have nothing pick on and they try to pick on people who is try to open the door slightly so that we can get our paid parts out of the yard.  They give people hard times, too. Overall of operation is just out run and no body seems give cares about anything.  And Just look at the overal Google reviews!!! 2.7 stars. I wish they are a lot lower but whoever put high rating on stars must be paid by Westside.    People be Aware !!!!!!</review>

Total BS The prices listed on the their pricing chart are not what they charge you at the register. I'm not talking core prices, They said their was a mistake on the price sheet. On multiple parts? I went threw all the work of pulling the parts and would not pay double what the price sheet list! So I took the good parts a pulled and threw them on the ground out in their yard! The other yard have better prices and no BS! Plus the guy giving the prices doesn't speak a word of English. You lost another Customer for life!< /text>

Never going here. Prices are way too high for a junkyard where I have to pull my own part IF they have it. They have no inventory information. Then the exit pat down? What am I fitting in my pockets? Screws? How much could they have lost to that? Guess the high price is for the Fort Knox "security". Customer service is horrible.<//review>

Is a junk yard where i can find the part you need,before, the prices was more cheaper... but since the last year they increase the price a bit.... i have not complain about the security guy with the metal detector, he is a cool man doing his job.... the complain is vs the owners  or management.. how they have in mind somebody will take out a motor or transmission into the packets... hellow!!!.

Security really? They made me remove my jackets because my jackets had metal buttons that come in the jacket. After buying my engine the curly headed lady in the front charging was a real jerk. She has a nasty attitude and makes fun of her customers for saying its expensive. Yeah right. All the employees mocked me including who i assume was the OWNER.
Good thing i dont live near this city. Ill stay in the local Stockton junk yards than make a trip to that junk yard even if i can't find the engines i need. Never going back.<//text>

< Review>
The truth...the whole facility and yard is organized very well compared to the other dismantling companies in Fresno. It was also the cleanest, you can tell the staff runs a tight ship there. I was able to buy my engine there for less than 200 bucks which is crazy cheap instead of getting hosed somewhere else for a grand or more. The body parts there are also very cheap, so it's disturbing when I hear other customers say it's expensive there. If they went to a full service yard or a dealer they would probly have a heart attack. They also give competitive prices for junk cars too, key word in this sentence is "junk". As for the security, they are strict which is good for them. I understand it's a junk yard there are literally millions of small parts people can shove in their pockets, I didn't have a problem with it. They were very cool about it, I know it's a business, we're on private property they have every right to screen people on the way out....it's call safeguarding their business which is smart. Now I know why those idiots Pick a Part went out of business, I used to see people wall out with a lot of parts (even engines/trannys) without being paid for. The workers there didn't care. At westside auto dismantlers it's kind of cool to see a staff that takes a little pride in what they do. They do treat you fair there it's the truth, you just can't treat them like crap there because they will bounce you out I have seen it done. I recommend this place for cheap parts, my experience was good. Best auto and truck dismantling yard in Fresno/ the valley. Beautiful building and office too, would of never thought it was a wrecking yard from the outside compared to alot of the other dumps in Fresno. Just don't steal they will bounce you out.<//Review>

This is a very good spot to watch the sunset. I especially like early morning hikes here as well. Last time I was here I saw a pod of dolphins in the water. The trial is steep and can be dangerous so be sure to wear shoes with decent tread and be mindful when crossing over the stream and going up the hill.<//review>

<review>Very beautiful spot to watch the sunset. However, parking is extremely limited and the fights over parking diminish the experience. This is not a sandy beach for families. To get to the beach you have to cross under a sign that warns of sheer cliffs and dangerous conditions. But if you want a place to watch the sunset at the top of the cliffs, this place is very beautiful.< /review><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
My brother got married here on 03/11/21 absolutely gorgeous spot, im sure their photos will come out amazingly. Plenty of space to social distance, either on thr cliffs or down on the beach by the water. Seemed to be a fairly dog friendly area as I saw more than a few people with their dogs hanging out or playing.</Review>

Beautiful area! I've been to Sunset Cliffs many times, but with the extra low tides right now, we were able to enjoy the tide pools and caves under the cliffs that are in accessible most of the year. Definitely a special afternoon and great memories.</Text>

A great scenic spot with sights and thrills all in one. Splash zone included, as well as dangerous cliffs. The water is clear here! Around sunset it gets busy.< /Review>

Definitely a nice view. And different from LA beaches. It’s just astonishing. I dk it’s the most interesting place in San Diego. Reminds me of SF, but on a sunny way. Easy to get there by public transportation too, although might have to wait some time for the bus.</text>

<Review>Peaceful spot on the coast. Plenty of parking and parking ya to get to. You can bring some towels or chairs and hang out or bring your walking shoes and get in some exercise. They have weddings here. The birds flying by and surfers catching some waves give you some extra views to check out. Great place to check out.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeM7HKHjHIKaZGhTPg7OiSM2FrzJ0W93obyylI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNd4SyM-mu7Ns6R8pfIEPU7CZR3AOGJu0sj-rmV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmHiKtoiqkm2G9fLe4PMuzY8-h9pHvSMAa8u8h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXuh0Xh7y72kx7aQacTLMo5NdgT_eS2o8KNmMY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFypGAdDkjvKON_vOJEBOarPAa4nvUtdDk2ws1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTffvE7BVkqgIitQJ7w2NSPT2RWjCpBhW54CU_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXpBEOawXU5j3vRL8pRL_nHCxGRpmaA2jlJRbY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80deabd04f961fdf:0x8dca463a22e81674< /GmapID></record>

The cliffs were really awesome. Found them on accident due to a wrong turn but what a find. Definitely a neat gem. I would recommend to anyone visiting or living in the San Diego area.</Review>

This was a great getaway for a few hrs. The water here was extremely clear. This place gives you a great view, easy drive and plenty of parking. You must visit these if you want to enjoy the ocean without actually getting in....<//Text>

Beautiful scenic view along the coast.  It can be dangerous in some areas.  Great place for photos and to chill and view the sunsets.< /Text>

Beautiful cliffy coastline, like a tiny replica of Algarve. A lot of caves could be explored along the coast, including an open ceiling cave, but only during negative tide.</review>

This is the most beautiful place in the world to watch the sunset. It's a great place to go for a walk and clear your mind. At all times of the day. Morning night afternoon whenever it's always a beautiful place to be. just be careful don't fall off the cliff.</review>

Always love it here. Great place to surf, sponge, and watch the sunset. Get there at an off time to find decent parking, occasionally the parking at the end of the road is open. I usually take family from out of town here since it is just a beautiful area with cool people. The hiking in the area is also nice. San Diego = No Bad Days!< /review>

Awesome place to watch that famous Pacific Ocean sunset in San Diego. There is a decent amount of parking available as well, so you don’t need to plan ahead that far. Watch out though as the rest of the people around will either be necking in their cars, toking up, or flying drones around, or all three. The sunset really is beautiful here though so it’s worth it.< /text>

This is one amazing spot to spend your evening by the cliffs. This place is also close to point Loma. There are some good restaurants although not very close to the oceanfront but within a mile or so...
Best place to watch the sunset in San Diego after the Coronado bridge for sure. Also, this is a very good spot for doing photoshoots!< /Text>

The name says it all, it is just cliffs so watch where you are walking, but to see the sunset here is a nice view. You can see people surfing, a lot of photography opportunities.</text></record>

Luscomb's Point is a nice place to watch a beautiful San Diego sunset. It is accessible via Sunset Cliffs Drive-south-from the I-8 Freeway west and also by taking the bridge (south) across the flood control channel ( You follow Sunset Cliffs Drive southward, straight through Ocean Beach and Luscomb's Point is a very large dirt lot, bordered on the east side of Sunset Cliffs Drive by the upscale Pt. Loma and beachfront homes.
The only parking is curbside and on a nice day it's often difficult to find a parking space without a short walk.
Luscomb's Point is well known as one of Sunset Cliffs premier righthand surf points; the bottom consists of flat rocky reef.
On a very good day, when the winter swells are out of the west or northwest and about 4' to 8,' this area produces some very nice righthanders : It's at it's very best between 6' to 8' with an occasional 10' beauty.
It's usually best when it's glassy or slightly windblown however, it can also get quite crowded; when it's at it's hot, it should be surfed by only very experienced surfers.
The crowd can also get quite aggressive but, surfing etiquette prevails.
It's best surfed at a medium to low tide, with the very low tides producing some extremely steep drops, walls and an occasional tube. The medium tides producing some long walls and nice off the lip rides ; if you can make it around an occasional inside wall, the ride is quite long.
It's also a good place for photographers, because the break is closer to the rocky shoreline.
When paddling out, it's fairly easy unless you get directly in front of the rocky wall when the sets are big and the tide is a little higher however, there are several good entry and exit spots.
It's also a shortboarder's wave. If you have a longboard, try North Garbage and other slower areas.
The best months are usually December through mid February. In the summer it's usually flat in this area.</text>

Great view, particularly during sunset.  I didn't spot the elusive green flash this time, but I would be happy to try my luck again someday at this beautiful cliff.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Nice sea ... I can see the starting point of the Pacific Ocean and the surrounding landscape is wonderful ... I am sorry that I have not seen the wonderful sunset because of the clouds.

<review>(Translated by Google) It is a really wonderful place to see sunset. Just like a scenic view from TV, beautiful cliff and ocean are together. Do not just imagine with pictures. It is worth going there. But the thing is that I used Uber to go there, and you have to be aware of the trafic. But still it only takes 15 ~ 20 min. from San Diego down town.
It is a really fantastic place to watch the sunset. It is very impressive with the cliffs and sea that I saw on TV. Do not just imagine the pictures, but you have to go. I went on the uber, but it is called the stagnant zone. However, it will take about 15 to 20 minutes to downtown San Diego.

일몰을 보기에 정말 환상적인 장소다. TV에서나 보던 절벽과 바다가 함께 있어서 매우 인상적이다. 사진만 보고 상상하지 말고 꼭 한 번 가보시길. 우버를 타고 갔는데 상습 정체 구간이라고 한다. 그래도 샌디에고 다운타운에서 15~20분 정도 걸리니 한국의 교통체증과는 많이 다른듯.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1_QTPVCe8K25yPKSzNFaZ4qguqUu1m5xfMwGL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOoe5DBLvEPNGL-NcRHRBHcBaPi2ipZ6ogaXGn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>
