< Review>
This was one of my favorite lunch places on my break from work. They have delicious chicken and nice portions for a great price. They have imported Mexico beer. I'd grab the chicken bowl and always have some to take home. Recommended!< /Review>

<review>I always see this on everyone's story and I just had to try it. Can confirm that it lives up to its hype. If you're a fan of the spicy chicken sandwich, than you'll love this!!! There's a huge spice range perfect to suit those who love spicy and those who can't really handle spicy (like me). Service was top notch and super friendly. Went after a concert and the line went by surprisingly fast.</review>< pictures>

Their chicken is nicely marinated and cooked perfectly so that meat is tender and not dry. I love the salsa bar where i can consume their pickled carrots and onions. We shared the whole chicken with two sides amongst three people and we were satisfied.</Review>

Don Jacinto Pollo Grill offers quality cheap Mexican food. The restaurant is located in a small shopping plaza next door to a water store and checks cash. The first thing which caught my eye were the big bright yellow signs out in front advertising specials, so said why not? Don Jacinto offers specials daily but Monday & Friday are the same. My favorite day to come is on Thursday, burrito & drink for $5. Quick tip, if you dine in, they provide free tortilla chips.

The Mexican restaurant is rather small maybe seating around 15 or 20 people. There are 2 large flat screens available for watching, generally in Spanish. During the past World Cup it brought in many locals & environment was definitely exciting.

I generally order the Al Pastor burrito with everything minus the beans. The burritos are a generous portion with a delicious salsa bar located towards the back. At first, the location of the salsa bar seemed sketchy because it's close to the bathroom, but the employees are constantly cleaning and restocking it. The service has always been great. The employees are welcoming and professional. I recommend getting the daily specials if you come here because the drink is free. All in a good restaurant for quick and cheap Mexican food.</Review>

Only down fall is its kinda expensive for chicken meals and the pieces you get are crap. Got a 10 piece and got 3 chicken drumsticks and 2 wings and paid over $20 for the 10 piece with two medium sides...<//Review>< Pictures>

We tried Don Jacinto's for the first time last night.  Order was delivered by doordash and I was pleasantly surprised by all the little extras in our order (the pickled onions were a nice touch).

Let me say my family LOVED the food. The chicken and carnitas are so flavorful, the caldo de res reminded me of my grandmother's. The best compliment I can give?
My husband and son told me "You can order this again any time!"<//Review>

The chicken in my caldo de pollo had a weird taste. Also, it had very little vegtables in the soup for $10 i feel a bit taken advantage of.</review>

I'd like to express my gratitude to this flower shop for giving me such a lovely bouquet. I just liked how you guys wrapped the roses. It was so beautiful and refined.

Everyone's top rating goes to you! Last Monday, I went to your flower shop to purchase a huge quantity of flowers. I was overjoyed when your florist helped me choose the perfect flowers for my mother's birthday party. I was ecstatic about the pricing because it was so fair. Thank you incredibly much! Strongly recommended!<//text>

<Review>It was the best experience I've ever had! The only flower shop in town that sells fresh flowers every day. In some areas, they also make deliveries. I called them yesterday and ordered a bouquet of roses for my grandmother's birthday. They delivered it on time, and my grandmother loved it! Congratulations! Thank you very much!< /Review>< Pictures>

Every other week I ordered flowers from this site to my office, and they were amazingly new and beautiful! They still arrive on time and last for nearly two weeks. As I get so many compliments on my arrangements, I recommend this place to all my mates! I will definitely soon reorder it again.</Review>

The product is of good quality and the best value for the money. The flowers came in earlier than what I expected and were arranged beautifully. A great way to surprise your loved ones free of hassle while still maintaining the quality. So thankful that they were able to deliver my orders despite the short turnaround. Highly recommended!<//review>

<Review>This lovely little hole-in-the-wall flower shop has a delightful array of flowers and greens options, and a friendly and helpful staff. As you walk in, the scent of its fresh collections greets you respectfully, not overwhelming at all (I'm sensitive to smells, and it was perfect).

I got a custom bouquet made for a friend who was having a rough time, and the staff made a beautiful arrangement that absolutely delighted her. Affordable, beautiful, highly recommended!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Love this shop, they always provide me with the best bouquets for all my occasions. Regardless of my budget, it's always the best stuff. Susan is so kind, and she ensure that she gives you her best work. It's always up to date and smells amazing in the store too so that's a plus. Over all I would recommend this place for all occasions.</review>

Every time I visit Nancy's Flower Shop I enjoy the beautiful selection of flowers this shop has. For Easter I purchased some exotic pieces and made a breathtaking arrangement. I got compliments all day long. I will definitely buy again, and again, and again. Their flowers are stunning!<//Review>

<text>Just a quick review for this flower shop because I was so impressed by the service. I called in to get a bouquet and Angela was really good about recommending bouquets for my needs. I ended up getting the USA bouquet and the arrangement looked amazing, especially with the burlap! I highly recommend choosing them for your flower needs!< /text>< Pics>

Just got off the phone with Eric.  Wanted an arrangement delivered to a church a couple of miles away in 60 minutes and they said no problem.  I called 4 other florists nearby and another florist recommended Nancy's. Excellent customer service, friendly and super fast.  Thank you!</Text>

Used this place to send flowers in SF for the first time and was not disappointed. The arrangement was gorgeous and delivered super fast. The staff who I spoke to on the phone were very helpful and made sure all my questions were answered. I ordered the deluxe 'florist's choice' in specific colors and they nailed it! Thank you, thank you, thank you!< /Text>

I live out of town, so I ordered online the Designer's Choice for my friend's birthday. It was beautiful. Posting a picture for reference. I ordered sans vase since I knew the bouquet would have to travel home after work. It came to a little over $50 with delivery.</Review>

<Review>I found Nancy's Flower Shop, on google, and all the 4 star reviews were more than accurate! I called on a Saturday morning to send flowers to a friend, and despite the fact Margaret had weddings to prepare for that day, she got the arrangement to my friend that afternoon. The arrangement was absolutely gorgeous! She even texted me a picture so I could see them. If you're looking for a great florist in the Los Angeles area, definitely use Nancy's Flower Shop!</Review>< Rate>

< Review>
Disclaimer...it뗩 a bit pricey. That being said, it뗩 well worth it! The employees were so kind, welcoming and helpful! Everyone had a great attitude and energy and the location had an open, relaxing design and is very spacious.

My friend and I tried this place on our way down from Santa Rosa and we did not expect it to be so wonderful!

I definitely think this should be for a nice breakfast or lunch but I feel so bad that we ate quickly and hopped back on the road.

Definitely try it out if you want a bougie, delicious meal made with love.</Review>

< Review>
I have always enjoyed the chicken wrap and the pesto pasta. A few hiccups along the way not sure if it was new staff but I got cilantro on the wrap once. It was taken care of immediately with a new wrap. Tonight I noticed green onions in the pesto pasta, I  don't really care for green onions even though they are in the wrap. So is this new, if so I might have to think about ordering this. I had even thought of asking for the recipe since I liked it so much. Thanks<//Review>

If I lived here this would be my favorite restaurant!  Absolutely outstanding!  Mom had the Tokyo Steak bowl.  I had the Yakuza bowl.  Super flavorful!  Tender meat and veggies cooked perfect.  Outstanding!!!</text>

Great place to come in, sit down, and use the WiFi while enjoying the best fries in Redding. Seriously, I don't think there's anywhere in Redding that has better fries. If you like crispy, satisfying, quality fries, this is the place flr you.<//text>

I뗤 revisiting this review because I think my 3 star wasn뗪 fair. Nobody can be perfect all the time and I had one disappointing experience. They have consistently good quality and service.  Early in the pandemic when they started taking delivery orders for staples like bread, cheese, meats, etc.one of the owners was out doing deliveries himself. I뗬e ordered from one of their other establishments and also had food delivered by an owner... not every owner cares that much, but they do. That뗩 what you can expect from them, and that뗩 what they뗬e shown over and over. A commitment to doing a great job and that is what they should be reviewed for.

Here뗩 my original review which is technically accurate but not representative of their high standards.

The food is good but the menu is limited and don뗪 try to order off-menu. For example, our family뗩 Valentines Day tradition since having kids is going to FTH and getting French Toast. They no longer have regular French Toast on the menu. I asked if they could make it and was told that only make the Mascarpone-Stuffed Croissant French Toast now. They have bread, they have eggs, they have all of the other ingredients but won뗪 do it. Even McDonalds does off-menu orders.<//review>

Outside seating is great! Fresh air yet still private. Perfect for meeting with friends when youbwant to linger for a bit. I recommend the strawberry cashew smoothie or their rice bowl choices!<//text>

<review>The food is great. We had the California chicken sandwich with fries and a cobb salad. Both were delicious, well balanced, and flavorful. We also got the blueberry crumble pie which was delicious! We went back the next morning to grab coffee before hitting the road and it was very good. The staff is friendly, the service is fast, and the covid-19 protocol is great. Highly recommend if you're in the area.<//review>< Pictures>

This place has amazing breads. Their French fries are the best! They have a nice selection of deli style meals. I had the California Chicken sandwich and loved it. Their jalapeno ranch was super tasty also!</Review>

<Text>Excellent service, really good food, the Reuben sandwich was perfect. House made chips are great.  The Cobb salad is outstanding, lots of bacon avocado, egg, huge chunks of chicken. The food is not the cheapest, but you get plenty and the quality is the best. Best pies in town too, the peach was super fresh  The new outdoor seating is perfect, it was over 100 degrees and it was still comfortable out there. This is one of the best places to eat in Redding. The convience store next door has a great selection of local beers too.<//Text>< pictures>

It's a little pricey, but the food is pretty good. I think their salads lack imagination and flavor, but I love their sandwiches. They also have really good pastries, which are homemade.</review>

<Text>I have eaten here for years, ever since it opened,  and it has always been fantastic.
So tonight I decided to try the takeout at 5. I have only been eating at home during lockdown. I ordered a well done caf칠 burger with Swiss cheese and no onion, and a side of fries. The burger was filling, so I just ate a few fries.
Then, about 15 minutes later, it all started coming back up.
This has Never been my experience there before. I wanted to let them know that something needs to be checked out! Old fry oil?The lettuce or tomato? I don뗪 know. But I have never had this from eating there before. And my stomach still is burning and upset 5 hours later, so I don뗪 know when or if I뗣l go back.<//Text><Time>1592803164669< /Time><gmapID>0x54d292ec6865264d:0x7a2a44cd97428f0</gmapID>< name>

<text>Although a tad pricey on the food, the quality is excellent, and the taste is superb. It is part food, part coffee shop. So there is plenty of room for people to study (although its encouraged during meal hours (lunch and dinner) that you do not stay to do homework/reading). The coffee is also very good. Their drip coffee is excellent as well, and if you stay in, you can get an 'in-house coffee' that allows for 2 free refills. Great stuff, and healthy!< /text>< Pictures>

Good food!  Price range is a tad little bit up around $10~ or more for hot sandwiches, but honestly not bad because the quality is great.  Coffee is great.

Waiting time isn't outrageous, just know if you're asking for some food know it's not necessarily fast food.  But it's faster than restaurants.< /Review>

Love this place. Multiple locations, everything on the menu is solid in my opinion, coffee is great, they sell Clean Yerba Mate and the employees are always helpful. I've never seen these restaurants dirty or disorganized. It's an all around good experience.</review>

<text>Good food, often pretty slow if you dont call in or order online first. But if you do, it is there when they say it will be.
You can make the Chi Bowl easily vegan so a good choice.< /text>< Pictures>

My girlfriend and I were passing through for a wedding and came across this on the way up. Talk about a diamond in the rough. I never write reviews, but the food there was so phenomenal I had to write something. I can't speak of all the locations but this one blew our minds, in fact we ate there twice because once for the weekend was not enough. If you're driving through, definitely stop there! And please bring a location to Sacramento.< /text>

We came to visit Bethel Church for the weekend and saw this place on the corner. Stopped in for breakfast and were pleasantly surprised. Super friendly staff, great food and a nice ambience. Kind of like a Panera Bread take-off. Highly recommended.< /Review>

Food is very good. Great sausage breakfast burritos. Service can be a bit slow at times because of crowds of people that frequent it. Staff is all top notch and friendly, usually after 2-3 times coming in they will recognize you on a first name basis.< /text>

I love this place! Their soup is amazing, and I can get a hearty breakfast a steamy cup of coffee and the most delicious bread I have ever had for a reasonable price. Their sourdough is made the right way and even though I have a mild gluten allergy I can have From the Heath bread with no I'll effects.  The folks are so flip pin friendly that work there, you might think we were old friends. Massive thumbs up!<//review>

Sort of shocking that there's such a nice cafe located attached to a gas station. Rather extensive menu, which by my limited sampling (breakfast burrito) is quite good. The coffee is good too, and the staff very friendly.<//Review>

They have screwed up my order almost every time I have been there , takes forever to get your food... even if you order ahead, service is marginal, food is marginal and waaaay over priced. They seem to promote a health food image but the first ingredient in most of their sauces is high fructose corn syrup?! yeah, I think not.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Love the food here! However it would be awesome if you had a line for call in orders, it defeats the whole purpose to call it in only to have to wait in a huge line to pick it up. I only have a half hour lunch and I never get to eat my sandwich on my actual lunch because I run out of time :(< /text>

The counter is not organised well; the front gets crowded and you get to the register before you see the pastry case. Otherwise service is great, coffee is delish. And food is very tasty. Prices are fair but I consider it a luxury rather than an everyday lunch or breakfast spot.<//text>

If you are in Redding for any amount of time you will find that the prices of food everywhere are high, excluding fast food chains. The hearth is an excellent option for breakfast, lunch, and even dinner. During the rush hours, you may not find a seat, because for Redding, this is one of the best options you have.</review>

Five stars for the staff! We tried a small assortment of sandwiches and they were all good. The kickin' chicken was messier than expected. The Italian was different than expected, but a good sandwich. The Mr. Pickles received high marks from our kids. We would return and recommend you give this location a shot. The quotes on the wall kept me entertained during the short wait, too.< /text>

I ordered the  Hot pastrami  And Swiss on sourdough. Was I really good sandwich! Also got a bag of chips in a large drink. Just over $15. A little pricey but it was a tasty sandwich. I did like their garlic sauce.  The young man that help me was polite quick and respectful of Covid  regulations<//Review>

These people don't know how to run a business. I called, and phone was not setup. I placed an order online and when I went to pick it up they said there system was down and they didn't have my order. The man then gave me attitude. Two hours later after I ate dinner they called me to say my pizza was ready. Not sure who is helping them put there pants on in the morning.</review>

The pizza was awesome! Perfectly baked. Crisp but not burnt. By far the best pizza I have had in a long time.</text>

The people there are so friendly that they actually make it a joy to go in and order pizza. You can order just a slice or you can order a complete pizza. One of their best pizzas is pepperoni, pineapple, and mushroom. It was really a joy to go there.</Text></record>

My fiance and I ordered some pizza, hot wings, and a cannoli from Nonni's for the first time and we loved it. The order was ready quickly, the price was reasonable, the staff was kind, and the food was delicious.  Can't wait to go back!<//Text>

<Text>Pizza quality is good.  They had issues with their online Grub Hub ordering system.  Advise to call to place order,  the traditional way. Unless you like showing up to be Notified your order hasn't been processed.< /Text>< pictures>

Best pizza in the area if you want something more than the usual chains. Ingredients are fresh and the pizzas taste amazing. I highly recommend their meat-lovers equivalent, it takes fewer slices to feel satisfied and full.</Review>

<text>This is the best pizza in the area, especially if youre from New York or the northeast. I뗬e noticed that native Californians don뗪 particularly like pizza from places that most accurately mimic New York뗩, so your mileage may vary. I뗛 like to take a star off because it뗩 so expensive & there뗩 no way to dine in, but I just can뗪 bring myself to do it because the pizza is SO much better than anywhere else nearby. I haven뗪 tried much else on the menu, although I did once order a sandwich & didn뗪 think it was worth trying again. I highly recommend the pies though, especially if you grew up in the northeast & are really missing the pizza달t뗩 hard to come by when you leave!</text>< Pics>

< Review>
I'm not a big fan of thin crust, so take what I have to say with a grain of salt. Also, I ordered the two slice student special, so the pizza was reheated in the oven after it had been sitting around for who knows how long.

The pizza was alright. It was light on the sauce and light on the crust. As I said, not my favorite.

It was quick and the guy working was cool, so that's a plus.

I'd go back and try one of their specialty pizzas. That way I could see if my opinion of the place changes.</Review>

One of the best pizzaria places in town there medium is about the size of a CA large large is XL and there Sicilian is awsome 16x16 highly recommend fresh hand made pizza not the literal card board you get at places like Domino's. If you are in the area and need a pizza place for a movie or end of week night definently recommend.</Review>

Just order for delivery,  the guy in the phone was in such a hurry he didn't want to answer questions... I ask for the "lasagna with meat sauce" and it was nothing but cheese with tomato... not worth the price. The Italian sandwich no flavor... what a mistake to order from this place.< /Review>

Calzone is amazing- it's not some lumpy undercooked folded pizza that others hawk as calzones- very legit. Prices are very good for the quality of food. I drive from north Claremont down here as often as I can. Place is discreet and next to Subway. Which sucks.
I have had a turkey sandwich and salad from this place as well- stick to the pizza and calzones.<//Review><user_name>ProCraft Pest Control<//user_name><Date>1522109852728</Date>< GmapID>

<Text>This place has the most delicious pizza in southern california in my opinion.  I think my opinion matters since I have eaten some of the finest pizza's on the planet including pizzeria bianco in tempe, AZ and pizzeria gino sorbillo in pizza capital itself, Naples, Italy.  Nonno's has amazing staff, food, and are hands down a place you need to try when coming to southern california.<//Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< user>

From start to finish, Right Now excelled!
Great customer service from Cynthia, Gloria and Leland.  Cynthia and Gloria took all our info accurately, provided us with what to expect and were able to send a technician right away.
Leland was quickly able to pinpoint the issue and provided us with solution options.  He then remedied the problem immediately and gave us the relief we needed.

Great staff and wonderful and knowledgeable people.  Highly recommend!</review>

Have been with Right Now Air for years. Installed new heat & ac a few years ago. They come out twice a year for maintenance and are always professional and friendly. They keep everything running smoothly and are reasonably priced.< /Review>

<Text>I met Mason Chapple at a local Chamber of Commerce event. He quickly introduced himself and told me all about the business he works for and how it could better people's quality of life. I let him know that at my mother's house, although she just purchased a new HVAC system, could not get her house past 78 degrees when it's in triple digits. He let me know that they provide free estimates on a bunch of services that could help us - specifically a whole-house fan. He had brochures on hand, and I immediately was hooked. My mom now has a quiet cool fan, and can get her house below 60 if she really wanted too! Thank you Mason!!!! You are a life savior!!!! You deserve a raise!!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>A great service! We had an excessive heat warning in the area and our AC died just in time for this. We called around 9pm in the evening (when we noticed the AC not working) and left a message. They had called us back by 8am with a technician on the way by 10am before the heat would get bad. They were able to fix everything and order parts needed, by noon. The technician was amazingly helpful, explained everything, and was very professional. The pricing was reasonable and had some discounts available. They뗬e also provide a service to come back to make sure everything is still working.</Text><Response>{'time': 1626115195145, 'text': 'Hi Emily!

<review>Juan was courteous, respectful and actually called to see if he could come early, which I thought was great. He explained he was running early and I can see why. They worked hard and were fast. Very impressed! They also did a thorough cleaning, repaired our existing thermostat and replaced our old broken one. Our AC hadn't been serviced in way too long and they were very thorough.<//review>< pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>We called Right Now to get our AC unit fixed and while the technician, Stuart, was professional, everything else was downhill from there. He was supposed to order the part, overnight it, and then be back at 8am to fix it.  No one showed so we called at 11 and was told it was a scheduling error and that he would be back out from 3-5. At 445, we receive a call saying they dont have the parts and can not fix it until "sometime next week".  Leaving me stranded Friday at 5pm to find another company or be in a 85+ degree house until "sometime next week". I then called Advanced Heating Plumbing & Air and they have been MORE than accommodating, communicative, and even CHEAPER.   Professionalism and communication are important aspects of business so I would not recommend this company. Save yourself and call Advanced Heating Plumbing and Air.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>Outstanding customer service by our technician Leland Hasterman 救넖잺救넖잺救넖잺救넖잺救넖잺
He went above and beyond, first of all he saved us around 2k. Last year we got a different technician and we were given an estimate for $2,600 to fix our AC. Well, this time around Leland came to check it out, he found out it was something different that the other technician said. We only had to paid $600. We now have a full working AC unit. Now let me tell you how he went above and beyond, while I went to drop my kids to Karate class, my husband who뗩 injured and can barely walk stayed home when our dog 游냤 got out. Well Leland came to the rescue, he helped getting Princess back to the house!!!
I can뗪 thank you enough Leland, may God bless you greatly!

< Review>
Technician came on Friday afternoon for an estimate. Said he we would get me a written estimate Monday since it was going into the weekend. Waited all day Monday and got nothing. Called Tuesday the next to see if the technician could send it over so I could review and compare with my wife. Got nothing back. Finally spoke to a nice lady Carrie on Wednesday. The tech sent it over and their wasn뗪 much detail to it. Would like to do business with them but seems like they didn뗪 want my money. Also, not sure what their guidelines are but he wasn뗪 wearing a mask nor did he wear any foot bottles going into my house.< /Review>

My electrical demands went up and I needed to add panels to my Solar System. I was given several options with the pros cons and associated prices but no pressure. I got to pick what was best for me, my budget and my needs.

I was informed when parts were ordered, when they should and did arrive and they worked around my schedule and the weather for the install. Install was quick and proficient.</text>

This company has their act together! Scheduling an appointment was easy with a new quick turnaround. Called on Tuesday afternoon and Leland showed up at 9 am on Thursday. They send out a scheduling reminder that includes the name and photo of who is coming. Leland was very professional and followed safety guidelines (mask, distancing). Highly recommend this company.< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Technician came over to do a diagnostic inspection on the HVAC system pretty much gave me a step-by-step instructions of what's going to happen if I decide to change over AC system also gave me a rundown of the sales team who's going to be helping me out. All and all was a very informative person to talk to. Kevin Emory was the AC technician. The company gave me heads up as far as when the appointment was going to take place easy to contact really friendly conducted themselves very well there was a diagnostic fee which was $69 but from the information that I learned I believe that $69 was worth it.</Text>< Pictures>

I made an appointment for a service tech to run
A diagnostic on a furnace. He was very knowledgeable and straightforward with the issue and the pricing which seemed reasonably.
He was not pushy and he was pleasant.
I then made an appointment to have a design technician to quote a project e from r a new furnace. His name is Brandon, and he was awesome, personable, and knowledgeable .  I am going to get a couple more bids before making a decision all things being equal Brandon nailed it.< /Review>

I really appreciated the communication between RNA and myself. They texted and called to remind me and gave me updates. My tech Kevin arrived on time. He was professional, very nice, and well prepared for the job. I liked that he showed me the different parts of our heater and after explained how I could help the heaters efficiency. I was not pressured to buy anything however he did suggest alternative filters than I currently have. Thanks to Kevin I am looking into the new Halo system. I would highly recommend RNA to friends and family as I was extremely happy with my over all experience with them.</Review>

Edgar showed up and might as well had a cape on. we were burning up in the house. and having 2 elderly parents in the house was of concern too with the heat.

Right Now Air came out the same day we realized our heat wasn뗪 working in early January 2021. They were incredibly responsive & professional, and they determined that a panel needed to be replaced for the furnace to function properly. They ordered it and initially thought that It would take eight days, but they ended up having it expedited and it arrived in three days. They even offered space heaters for our use in the interim.

Kevin, the technician was fantastic and was great to work with. Gloria too! We are now going to use Right Now Air for our regular HVAC service and maintenance. Highly recommend!!</review>

<review>I just purchased a home 2 weeks ago and upon moving in my AC doesn뗪 work. It was expected (just not as soon as it happened).

I called right now air this morning, and they had somebody (Brian H.) out here by 2 PM to give me an estimate. Brian arrived about 15 minutes early and was very friendly and patient with me having several children in the home when he arrived. He spent a good amount of time explaining everything about my current HVAC system to me as well as telling me the options for my new one. If I didn뗪 understand some thing he broke it down into terms that I could. I feel like an HVAC pro after meeting with him LOL. This company offered me rebates in advance to lower my purchase price and also offers healthcare worker AND cash  discounts to those who qualify. I am able to get a top-of-the-line Mitsubishi HVAC system installed in my house with new lines for $2000+ cheaper than the FOUR other quotes that I뗬e gotten from other reputable companies for a much lesser quality system. I also got a Reme Halo uv light filter.  The other offers I got were for 1 and two stage units. This is a 700 stage unit and is a top-of-the-line energy-efficient unit. So had I not called right now air, I would be paying $2000 to $4000 MORE for a much LESSER  product (and keeping all my old 40+ yr old copper lines in my house). SO glad I called them. Brian did not try to pressure me or sell me something that I did not need. He went into a deep conversation with me to determine my actual needs and gave me a recommendation based on that, nothing more. I didn뗪 feel rushed or like just another appointment to the rep. Thank you Right Now Air for Employing impressive and knowledgeable staff like Brian and serving your community in a helpful and efficient manner, without being greedy. Should I have any future HVAC needs or know anyone else that should I will be calling and or recommending you guys.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Just received a quote from Right Now Air to change out our HVAC at our residence. Adam and Juan were great and respectful with our property and utilized safe practices. We have a couple more companies we are getting quotes from, but was very happy with their quote. We should be making our decision by next week and I뗣l update if we decided to work with Right Now Air.</Review>< pics>

I can뗪 say enough wonderful things about Right Now Air! Trustworthy, friendly, professional, quality work, attention to detail (literally EVERY detail) and COVID conscious. We replaced our entire AC/Heater and all of our ducts. Went from a one stage to two stage, zoned system. It was a two day job and they were all over our house. They left it so clean I couldn뗪 even tell they were here when they left except that I now have a cool upstairs! Everyone we interacted with from office staff, to Adam who spent over an hour with us going over options and ensuring we fully understood what we were getting, to Ken who came prior to the install to make sure we got to choose where the thermostats were placed and how wiring would be run, to the amazing install crew! Miguel and the install team were fantastic! Seriously, if youre looking for an AC/Heating company Right Now Air is the absolute BEST!</text>

it's hard to make a full-blown review about a product we have yet to choose we're in the process of shopping for solar these guys came in and showed us that our entire system needs to be overhauled in order to be energy efficient which I'm not surprised. I have yet to make a decision about who I'm going to use for solar or if I'm going to go through with a whole overhaul thing My experience with them so far has been extremely positive.< /Text>

<text>They came within a couple hours of calling unlike several other places I had contacted. The service tech Edgar was honest and professional. He informed us quickly that another technician with more experience of older units would need to evaluate and explained some of the problem as he could tell. Only drawback for us at that point is that we didn뗪 receive an instant estimate for repairs and that a recommendation for replacement of both the AC unit and furnace was what he thought would end up having to happen. Though he gave us different verbal amounts, (which ended up being much less than he had said at that point). The salesman ended up giving us the inspection and estimate after his own thorough review. His estimate was the first we have officially received so I can뗪 comment on comparable quotes yet. The service included more than just installation, and all of the other ducts would be sealed as well as replacing any ducts or vents that needed it. Also a guarantee of services (equipment(20yrs) and labor(1yr)   Up to this point, they have been an overall good company with quality products, and  great employees who are good at communicating their knowledge. We are definitely considering them as a good standard to go off of when comparing costs, time until Install, professionalism, and equipment quality. I would recommend them and hope to update this post with more info.<//text>< Pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Santos came out to provide a second opinion on air flow/ducting concerns. He was very professional and knowledgeable and was able to answer and explain all questions/concerns I had. He was straightforward and provided information regarding what the company offered, but was not pushy. He provided a solution for the concern without up selling. The first estimate (from a different company) suggested we replace all the ducting and upgrade both the air conditioning and heating unit. Santos showed me and explained that the ducting was still in good working order, so there was no need to replace, but the addition of dampers and air flow balancing may be the solution. I felt his assessment was honest, which I appreciated. At my request, he provided an estimate for some other things so we are mulling over the options. I am pleased with the quality customer service /estimate received which often speaks highly of the company. I recommend giving them a call.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I explained exactly the service I needed and they scheduled an appointment for 2days after.

Amazing!  Of course our AC broke during the hottest week of the year.  They were able to get us in for an appointment days before anyone else.  Some other companies didn뗪 answer their phone...or wanted to put me on a waiting list just to even make an appointment.  Kevin was the technician that helped us.

Ricky Ables installed my AC and heating system. He was very open to telling me exactly what he was doing and what he has done.  Told me how my system works and what to expect once it뗩 installed.  He answered all of my questions honestly and knowledgeably.  The work looked very professional and clean.  Basically got everything working and also helped me in setting up my thermostat connected to my wi-fi which saved me a lot of time.  He told me everything I needed to know to operate the system.  Been a long time customer and will continue to be.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Right Now Air has had our heater/air conditioner maintenance contract for years now, and I couldn't be happier. Today's service was performed by Stu, a very capable and knowledgeable technician. Stu was meticulous in his attention to detail and kept us informed of his progress every step of the way. He took his time, and made sure all the steps were thoroughly completed. Stu also ensured our solar panels were clean for maximum power production. I am completely satisfied with Right Now Air and have no need to consider changing providers. Stu and Right Now Air also that, as a veteran, they appreciate my service, and go the extra mile to show it.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1589571705081, 'text': 'Doug, this is an awesome review!

<Date>1626807488370<//Date><review>Exceptional Technicians with Fantastic Service and Quality Products!!

With a 27 year old AC unit and a 43 year old gas unit in our HVAC system, we were due for a change.  We wanted to check on a whole house fan as well and insullation.

We selected Right Now Air & Solar because they have had a long very positive  record of excellent service, and they installed the  HVAC system where my wife works.

Adam came out to talk with us about their HVAC systems, a whole house fan, and also insulation, He is knowledgeable, down-to-earth, personable, and very helpful!  We had planned to have the work done based on what we could afford early next year.  With PG&E rebates and other breaks, the price was so affordable that we said do it NOW!  We were so excited to not have to wait for months and months because of their reasonable prices! Ken who is one of the supervisors came out to survey the job the same day.  He made some very helpful suggestions that were of great help.

Two days later they sent two crews out who accomplished all the work except the insullation in less than one day!  (A separate group does the insullation.)  These members of a very highly professional team of technicians do exceptioanal work!  Ricky, the Team Leader, installed the gas furnace perfectly.  He directed his teams in various duties:  Andrew and Jose worked on the ducts, sealing them to prevent outside air from coming through the system. They cleaned and vacuumed the ducts to remove dust and dirt form the system.  Miguel  and Andrew suggested the best position for the whole house fan intake in our hallway, centrally located in our home.  By the way, the whole house fan is very quiet because the fan is up in the attic, and the intake is located on a ceiling. It comes with a wireless switch to opearate it.  Chaz and Leland installed the large AC unit outside and removed the old one with great attention to all the connections and assembly required.

Each one of these crews did extra, helped each other, and was very conscientous.  Several did multiple tasks.  They had to remove a metal container formng the intake air pathway for the system under a box-like structure on which the heating unit and the fan unit sits in the garage.  They had to enlarge the intake air vent leading to the house while making a larger airtight area below the fan unit from which to draw air.  This was a challenging task which they executed flawlessly with great attention to detail and much precision.  It lowered intake noise, made the unit more efficient, and increased the airflow with less stress on the fan.  Jose and Miguel put an additional support under that box-like structure within the intake chamber to support the structure which holds and supports the heatintg and fan units.  In the process he straightened out the hot water heater which had been leaning due the lack of proper support for its base.  I am so thankful for this extra effort of his and everyone else!  Andrew helped me with the whole house remote and the new HVAC  thermostat which was linked with the internet.  Miguel set up a junction box for the electric connection for the whole house fan.

They swept, cleaned, and removed any waste created by their installation!  They put down protective material for the carpet, and were extremely concientious in cleaning up and not doing any damage to anything!  All waste was removed, and we had noting to clean up after they left.  They worked together very well  They collaborated professionally like a Team, and it was a pleasure to see them work!

My wife and I are extraordinarily happy to have received great service from Technicians who seemed like your own family and who went the extra mile and did many extras to install their high quality products.

I highly recommend Right Now Solar and Air!</review>< user_id>

Edgar did a great job  on the new AC and Cleaning the Solar Panels. He was very thorough and professional.  He explained what he was doing in words we could understand.  He performed over and above our expectations. He impressed us as a younger version of his boss.  We hope he will be assigned when the next maintenance work is due.  Walt Bunter< /review>

I visited their website and used their live chat option to request an appointment to get my AC fixed. Mason gathered info quickly and passed it along professionally, and within 20 minutes I got a call from Mimi who was very personable and scheduled me an appointment for the end of this week. 15 minutes later she called me back and rescheduled for an earlier opening today, 3 days sooner than I expected. Santos called this morning and asked if it was okay to come before my appointment time, because he was running early. He came out and had my AC up and running before my original appointment slot time even started, and did a comprehensive check on all of my systems. He let me know options between routine maintenance, possible repairs to extend the life of my old unit, and all the way up to upgrades to my whole system that were very intriguing. He handled the visit to my chaotic house with professionalism and friendliness. I didn't feel pressured into anything, the repair and visit was very affordable, and I will be doing more business with this company in the future!<//text>

<Text>Called the office close to 5pm on Friday and was surprised someone answered.  Professional gentleman named Josh was very helpful and nice. Received emails and confirmation texts for appt two days later, which was  great. BUT, was concerned on appointment day that they didn't show up between alottee time nor called. However, as soon as I followed up with a call to the answering service they called me back with an update. When Our technician Alan T..arrived he was very professional and helpful in fixing our problem. Thank goodness because its been over 100 degrees for the last three days. They need to send delay text messages when their behind on appointments,  but overall I'd use this service again.  They have their customer service down.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I've been with Right Now Air for about 5 or so years now. excellent service. My tech Stu has been taking care of me from the start and he knows I trust him to handle whatever is wrong. I'm part of the 3 star plan and it does help when something interesting breaks. my system is 20 years old but runs like new. Been recently in contact with Izi as its that time of year to make sure my ac is rock steady for those triple digit days coming up. speaking with him excellent service and a stand up guy just like Stu.</text>

<text>Kevin is the best! Super knowledgeable and friendly guy. I felt really bad about having him come out on Memorial Day but we have tenants with health issues and needed the AC unit repaired ASAP! He got us up and running! Were very pleased with every aspect of the service. When were ready to replace the unit, we are going with Right Now Air and hopefully Kevin will be our Technician!< /text><gmapID>0x808522ec8722ecd1:0xb1942131290a116c< /gmapID><pictures>None< /pictures>< Date>

The service was outstanding.  They explained the issue and what's needed to make the system work properly.  The service received in 1849 Quail Meadows Circle with Edgar Aspeitia was excellent.  I would like to have him again in the future services because he did extra mile to climb up the roof to clean the solar panels.

Alan Tibbett also performed an outstanding job.  He fixed those that needed to be fixed and pointed out those that needs to be repaired.

Both technicians did a great job and I'm glad I chose Right Now Air for service provider because they practice loyalty to their customers.< /text>

<gmap_id>0x808522ec8722ecd1:0xb1942131290a116c</gmap_id><Review>I had an annual maintenance scheduled for today, 10-11am arrival time. At 11:35 or so, I called to see if I had been rescheduled. The customer rep said no, I was still on the schedule, and while I waited briefly, she confirmed with the tech. He was just finishing at the prior appointment. He arrived about 10 mins later. He introduced himself, told me what he would be doing, and began the work. He finished with his recommendations, which will be emailed to me. Tech was professional, both in appearance and demeanor. He put on booties when he had work to do inside, removed them when he went out. His recommendations made sense, although I have opted to wait on them. That being said, we both know what is recommended so there will be no misunderstanding at a later date.< /Review>< rate>

A/C went out on Sunday evening!
Monday morning put out a message on Yelp for a repair .... .got a lot of responses......most said they could come out.  TUESDAY!  it's like 100 Degrees!!!!  Right now said they could be there at 10 AM Monday and even said if I would have put the call out last night (Sunday) they could have come out then!
So at 9AM (not 10 they called and asked If I was home they could be early! YES!)
2 clean cut uniformed young men (Alan & Wyatt) showed up at my front door.
Processed to go through my ENTIRE A/C unit! Found the problem.....the problem was ME the operator.....checked out my entire HVAC
unit ....OFFERED not hard sell but offered the services of their company......and charged me the absolute minimum........THIS IS A FIVE STAR COMPANY!!!  AND I AM A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!!!!  I Have a similar review on YELP......Stephen OBAZA
I have no affiliation with this company......as a consumer I am always OVERJOYED to find a business with old time customer service.</Text>

<text>I was given the timeframe that a technician would be at my house btw 12-2. No one showed up until after 4. The temperature outside was 106 and the temperature in my house over 90. I received a call closer to 4 to let me know that someone was on the way. No apology for the tardiness. The technician was nice though.< /text>< UserId.>

Unfortunately my unit broke down over the holiday weekend. And we struggle with out air until Tuesday on a hot weekend and week and I thank the people of right now air for sending a technician way earlier than my appointment time. We were very grateful since the temperature was going to hit 102 to 104 today.</text>

I have used this company for years and just had another reminder why I stay with them.  I recently had a new heating unit installed. Eddie, Wyatt and Tony  from Right Now Air installed my unit.  They were awesome, worked well as a team, made sure they did everything right even if it took a little more time, were professional and personable.  They represented their company well.  I highly recommend this company if you want a job well done.<//review>

From customer service to the Kevin my technician 5-star service.  Tech texted me about 30 minutes prior to showing up with his picture so I would know who he was.  He showed up on time if not early, and quickly fixed the problem.  We will use them again.</text>

It was cold and our furnace had died.  We had an expensive quote to repair our furnace from another company with NO warranty.   Thus we were faced with replacement.

We were gathering estimates to replace our furnace.  Adam Deadrich  from Right Now Air suggested repairing our furnace with a warranty at a reasonable price.  No pressure or up charges and saving us thousands over replacement.

Thank you Adam and Right Now Air for GREAT Customer Service!<//text>

This company is awesome. Our furnace went out at night. I called in the morning and they had a technician out by the afternoon. Carlos was great. Figured out the problem, got us heat until a part was available. In two days Carlos called to say he was on his way, all was repaired and now working just fine. The office staff is friendly and helpful. Thanks again.<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Since I have an HVAC maintenance plan with I Right Now Air I called you and asked if you installed 30 Amp circuits because I was considering replacing my gas water heater with an electric one.  I was told that you did and that you would send someone to give me an estimate on the circuit installation.

What I got was a salesman (nice as he was) that tried to sell me an electric water heater plus installation for $8000.  Who the hell pays $8000 to take a hot shower?  I can buy an electric water heater from Home Depot for $1200 and I looked up the average installation cost for a 30Amp circuit to run 15 feet in my area and its about $1500.  I guess connecting the hot and cold water to the unit and plugging it in is as complicated as neuro-surgery.  In the end I never got my estimate to install a 30 amp circuit.  But I will find one.  Thank for your help.  I will give you 3 stars because I liked Brandon and your maintenance is good.

I like RNA and really appreciated Bruce who came to my house before the install to help me decide on what I would be buying.  Bruce has a great demeanor and was also expedient about calling me back the several times I called him with various questions.<//Text>< Rate>

I had an AC maintenance appointment scheduled from 10am-2pm. I got a call around 1:50 saying they would be a little late but we're on the way. This would have been fine if they showed up not long afterward. After another hour of waiting I called the office at 3, and was told he was still on another call. He finally arrived after 3:45. What is the point of scheduling an appointment if I still have to sit around for waiting for nearly 6 hours? You already had a 4 hour window which is inconvenient enough.< /Text>

I wouldn't give one star but that isn't an option. My AC went out, the tech came out and told me it would be close to $500, when I said no, he told me $380ish, again I said no, he then left, he came back and his last offer was $194, but I would have to purchase a maintenance agreement $12 a month for 12 months. I agreed, but before he returned from his car I made a call, my friend said hell no, tell him to leave I'll send my buddy over. I got the work done for $80. It's 98춿 outside, my house is nice and cool.< /text>

I am grateful for the excellent response time on a Saturday evening,
The only company out of 16 who kindly answered our call.
With 2 seniors in their 90s and no heating in the house, we were desperate. Mr. John, the technician who came at our home, is an excellent professional, knowledgeable and a courteous gentlemen who very quickly diagnosed and repaired our heater.
I highly recommend this company for anybody who needs HVAC service</Text>

<user_name>Rick Uchida<//user_name><time>1496847280395<//time><rating>1< /rating><text>A few years ago I was talked into signing up for a monthly service plan which would include periodic inspections of my heating and air conditioning systems.  Over these years my "scheduled " appointments would be cancelled by Right Now Air, sometimes at the last minute after either my wife and or I had cleared our busy calendars.  Because of the numerous cancellations and poor service I cancelled the monthly plan.  Even after it was cancelled and acknowledged, Right Now Air still continued to bill me.  I highly recommend you go elsewhere for any heating and air conditioning service< /text>< Pictures>

Not sure where to start it was a long day, could have been much worse if it wasn't for Tom and Don. These two fine young men went above and beyound fixing my a/c they actually did some electrical work in the panel .

That was about to be a serious problem if it wasn't already, recommend these two guys  and this company YES i would and if i was to start a company i would do what it took to have these guys on my payroll, thank you again RIGHT NOW AIR great job today<//Text>

I agree with Janet.    Chad just completed the annual checkup of my air conditioner.   He moves quickly and deliberately giving me confidence that he knows what he's doing.   He is pleasant and entertaining as well.</text>

No followup...no returned call. Call them on a Saturday around 4 pm. Told they would get technician to call me. 6 pm called again and was told they would inform technician to call. 6:20 technician called. Said he would be there Sunday between 10 and 2. No show! Called cell several times no answer. So here it is now 4:20 pm and one of my residence has no air and it's 103 degrees!!! VERY POOR SERVICE!< /text>

BEWARE. I had a horrible experience with this company that leaves me feeling as though they are more focused on selling their "service plans" and their overpriced repairs than actually servicing customers. They diagnosed my whole house fan as broken, quoted me $800-3000 for replacement, "could not find a replacement motor" (guess what, there's one available on Amazon) and as it turns out, my friend fixed my whole house fan with a crescent wrench and a voltage meter. There was a switch turned off and a piece of string tangled up in it. Please, do not use this company for any service to your HVAC equipment. They seem to suffer from a complete lack of integrity in their business practices.</Text>

<Text>Back in 2014 I purchased a Brand New Trane HVAC System, two actually, one for upstairs and one for downstairs, and just now a problem occurs with the system requiring replacement of a part. John sends his man Stu out to fix it and for two hours of labour I'm charged $749.00.

Get your estimates AHEAD of time and call around as you WILL be paying High Premium with those Labour Fees with RIGHT NOW AIR!!</Text></record>

Pastries and doughnut are big! So I guess it's worth $$. Wish this place was bigger because it packs in customers. Quality of doughnuts are very good!!</review>

<Text>Surprisingly good donuts! Not your run-of-the-mill donut shop, although it definitely exudes that hole in the wall atmosphere. Everything here is obviously fresh and they have a good selection. The breakfast sandwiches are decent; I wouldn't go here just for those but you could do worse if you're hungry and want something besides the box you're picking up for the office.</Text>< pics>

If you get there early the ham and cheese stuffed croissant is good when fresh and cheap too. The owners are good people but usually in a rush cause the place is busy early morning so you wait in line sometimes. Really good hole in the wall breakfast spot.</text><GmapID>0x808f910fe7f44e6f:0x329452b4cb7e165e<//GmapID><username>Red</username>< Rating>

Treated myself to chocolate glazed and donut holes...and picked up some to share. Very fresh  and perfectly done
A line for the warm breakfast (so I know that was good, but didnt have time to try it).   The vietnamese iced coffee was excellent as well. If I'm going to have a donut or bear claw, THIS is the recommended choice!<//text>

This place has the best donuts in the greater Bay area.  I travel weekly through Sacramento and the East and South Bay areas buying donuts everywhere I go for my customers. These are the only donuts that tempt me. Seriously good on another level.</text>

Really good donuts, great service. They sell lottery tickets as well, and can be very busy but try to get customers what they want as quickly as possible. Saturday mornings are the busiest,  probably because of the bacon donuts. A very picky friend loves the jelly donuts here.  Parking is available but the shopping center is not well kept and feels grimey.</text>

Best donuts in Hayward. Everything I tried I have to try over and over. Whatever it is they put in their donuts makes me want more every time. Any and all flavors are highly recommended. Will update this review again.<//Text>

<text>Its my favorite donut shop and for good reason. I've been going there for over 25 years and the quality has never wavered. The bacon maple bars are so delicious! And the jelly donuts will change how you view jelly donuts forever. They're HUGE! And with A LOT of jelly. And they have the best bagel breakfast sandwiches, too. Go there. Now.<//text>< pictures>

VERY popular spot with a large selection of donuts. Their dough is not as airy as other places, and they tend to go more for the bread-y/dense style. Not my preference, but the taste of the donuts are still solid.

Large lot for parking.</Review>

If you get here in the morning when the doors first open, you get fresh warm donuts. They melt in your mouth. They got a honey wheat donut.. I get it with a Kona Hawaiian blend medium roast first thing in the morning.< /Review>< Pics>

It's decent,  though they could invest in some new upholstery and clean up the place.. it's a place where "regulars" frequent and has a steady stream of loyal customers. Coffee and donuts are ok and cheap..<//Text>

Such a kind woman owns the shop ,even at 5am she managed the cheer us up after not being able to sleep for hours on an overnight flight. So generous and easy to talk to. Also the donuts were amazingamazing! The custard she makes is the nectar of the gods and sweet jesus the apple fritter... And those little custard puffs ! Snd there was this crunch panini with jalapenos! Ugh just all amazing</Review>

I grew up eating these. When I moved away in 2008, I got to come back, to visit in 2014, and they where -the same amazing donuts-. To this day I have not found any where that compares to Worlds Fare. The are the most amazing donuts I have ever had.< /review>

I'm telling you they are way overpriced it's crazy $2.25 for a cinnamon roll and a $1.40 for just a regular donut that's crazy way to expensive. The service really isn't all that good either I mean they're pretty rude there at least they were to me. They were too busy trying to get money from me they forgot to give me my donut and just as quick they were on to the next person leaving me standing there trying to argue I never got my donut I definitely won't go back to this place</review>< pics>

<text>Their donuts are great. Wonderful dough and at cheap prices. The only thing I have a problem with is that they tend to run out of glazed donuts quickly. By 10 am they're already out and this place is open well into the afternoon.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Review>Kinda old looking inside.  Donuts are ok nothing special.  The lottery is the big thing here.  Many people frequent this place for that reason alone.  Its considered a hot spot for winning. When Kauavanaugh (spelling?) Liquors closed this became the spot to buy lottery tickets. Must be true. Ten $2 scratches yielded $65 payback. Of course I played it all back.

Best doughnuts ever!!! The glazed raised are approximately 2" high. The owners are sweet and always give kids complimentary "holes on a stick." When you buy a dozen, they add a couple doughnt holes to your box. Our favorite place for doughnuts,EVER!!!</Review>

Gross  I've never seen a donut shop get so many things wrong. The maple color is way off, more like a mustard green. The glaze color is off. The donuts were messy, like they'd been shuffled all around before being displayed. Also.. SMELLS. LIKE. VOMIT   inside. The donuts taste fine, I guess.<//text>

This place does have some really great doughnuts and coffee. However my only complaint is the prices of the doughnuts when they are ordered as a dozen. It뗩 $12 for a regular dozen doughnuts, but youre charged almost twice that amount when you order a dozen specialty doughnuts such as bear claws, cinnamon rolls, apple fritters, and even croissants. It뗩 because of the pastries at World Fare Donuts are oversized.<//text>

<Text>Best doughnut spot around,  little run down at some spots like the booths and such.  They have been here forever and the quality and care realty shine through.   The little ones get free doughnut holes on a stick (which helps pacify them), and the owners family is amazing and we have watched them grow up just like they have watched ours grow.   Best doughnut spot ever!</Text>< pictures>

Well I could not put anything less, traveled for about 15 minutes to get here, to find out that not even a quarter of the showcase was available. Granted that they were going to be open till 5 PM on this particular day, but was not impressed by any means. This was just my experience with my my family. Will not be returning to this establishment again, sorry.< /review>

<user>113064813386255283434< /user><review>I believe that in concept the flame broiler is a good idea. However 90% of the ones I enter, are dirty and messy, and the food is rarely prepared fresh. Maybe that's what I should expect for $9, not entirely sure. However it's been years since I've had a dish that wasn't overcooked and that was hot when I received it, or a day I've gone in and haven't complained about giving too much sauce away. Maybe it's time for the flame broiler to retire.<//review>< pictures>

<text>I don뗪 understand why it says they close at 9 but twice I went in, and they refused my service and said they close @ 8:30. I love flame broiler but that뗩 so frustrating. It makes me not want to go there anymore.</text>< UserId.>

I'm a fan of the bowls here, and the sauce is yummy - definitely . I have never been given an incorrect order, and everyone has usually been very nice. Great for a quick lunch or an easy dinner.</Review>

We bought some furniture from Costco and had no way to get it home so we tried GoShare.  The app took a few minutes for us to figure out but once we got to the point where we could get an estimate we were good to go.  If you are new to GoShare be aware that you need to put your payment info in on Payment Methods"  BEFORE you put in your order.  Otherwise you will get a no payment message when you try to complete the order.

We ordered a truck and a helper.  We didn't realize that the helper would arrive separately.  With the help of the store we got all the boxes in the truck before the helper arrived.  That was OK though as we sent him to the drop off point and he was able to help there.

Would we use GoShare again?  Of course!  I put a lot of apps on my phone and then remove them after using them once.  This one I am going to keep around because there will be more times when I need to move items.< /Review>

I have used GoShare on couple occasions to move a wine fridge and a large buffet table I purchased locally. The services were performed at the requested times, and both deliveries were very satisfactory. I hired both the driver and helper for both jobs, and all had the masks on properly to keep everyone safe. The price was reasonable, and I will be continuing to use this service for large deliveries that require large vehicle and some manpower.< /Text>

<text>I was nervous at first since I뗬e never heard of this service before, but I am so glad I discovered them! They picked up my item within 1 hour and delivered it in under 60 mins. Very nice and the app was easy to use. They could def use more features like a more in depth admin section, but I뗤 sure that will come in time. Highly recommended!!<//text>< pics>

<review>The driver and helper were great! The website however changed my request and sent the driver and helper the same address for pick up and delivery. So they both showed up at my house instead of the pick up location. I felt bad for them. Neither complained at all and went straight to the other location and didn뗪 charge me for the additional time involved. Both were very professional and courteous.<//review></record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>GoShare is definitely a convenient and cost effective option to renting a U-Haul or hiring movers. I needed a new washer and dryer picked up from Lowe's and was having trouble renting a U-Haul as they were all taken. I signed up for GoShare and within moments I had arranged for a helper along with a van. The driver / helper arrived on time, was professional, and took care with my items. Definitely a time and money saver!<//Text><user>116243873448373392322</user></record></dataset><record>

The driver was wonderful, very helpful, pleasant and very willing to go the xtra mile, not actually the mileage but with his helping if needed.  Aaron was wonderful. If I used this company again I would want Aaron again to do the job.<//text>

<Date>1604974289077<//Date><Rating>2< /Rating><text>When the two guys came to deliver set up they did a poor job . we asked if they would remove the old bed and assemble and we were told at the store they would.Then when they arrived they advised us that they do not remove for nature from the room we had to remove it ourselves or they would not have said it up. Then they did a poor job they assembled the frame did fine with that but they put the box spring upside down on the bed and put the mattresses on top then we were getting onto the bed and the mattress started falling in we did not understand that so we took the mattresses off the box spring and found that they had put the box springs upside down so we had to take them off and turn them over and then put the mattress back on and this was extremely hard because I am a handicap person so this did not make me very happy will never use this service again</text>< Pictures>

<Review>I was quoted one price and the final price was way over the quote. The timing does not even work out correctly for what I was charged. As I know the distance and the time it takes to get from point a to point b. I recommend meeting them at the place where they are picking up from as then they can't lollygag and add extra time.

This was my first time using the GoShare app to have a couch picked up from storage and moved to a house several miles away.  My 랋roject was assigned within minutes of entering it.  Our driver -Sena- was on time (even a few minutes early!), was incredibly courteous, came prepared with a tarp in case it rained, and all straps needed to secure the load. He helped unload and was out the door with a wave and a smile.  What a great experience all around.  Will definitely use again and refer others.  I loved that we were able to tip via the app and rate him.  Thanks!< /review>

I ordered 2 guys, a truck, and a ramp to move a large trunk to a resale shop.   The main guy was a no show and no response to my voice mail.  Not good.  Luckily the other guy (the helper) was on time, called beforehand to assess the job, brought his truck with a trailer and was able to load my furniture piece by himself.  So Joshua was excellent.  I had to text customer service many times in 2 days to talk about the particulars and Emily was immediately available each time.  That was the best part.  Excellent customer service.<//Review>

Both the truck owner/driver and the extra "helper" I requested (as my item was large/heavy) were really nice, quick and conscientious. Great app!< /text>< Name>

< review>
I needed to get two very large and heavy items home from Costco, and as it's Costco I couldn't wait for my friend that usually helps me with such things. A Costco employee handed me the business card for GoShare and said they have people use it all the time so I felt comfortable trying it. It was late in the afternoon when I posted my job, and I knew it would need at least two guys so I added a helper. The helper grabbed the job immediately and not long after that the driver (the job also required a box truck so I wasn't sure anyone would be available) grabbed the job as well, so my first hurdle was crossed.

They were both early, and I didn't realize it at the time, but the driver brought another guy to help him as well, perhaps most people don't think about adding a helper? In any case, all of the men were professional and careful. I really appreciate them being willing to do the job and I had no problem adding a tip to the base cost of the job and giving the two that were listed 5 stars for their work. I realized belatedly I should have given an extra tip to the driver, for his friend, but it was too late to change that. I just hope they know I appreciated how careful they were, as not everyone is.< /review>

{'time': 1576610912221, 'text': 'We are sorry for any misunderstanding. When you placed an order, a hold was placed on your account. When a hold is put on your account, the bank temporarily reserves funds for an expected future payment. The funds are never removed from your account. An estimated amount is temporarily 랃eld back from account funds available for spending. This ensures that when your card is billed, there is enough money in the account to handle the transactions. Placing a hold on credit cards is a common practice by companies that provide goods and services before issuing a bill or charge, such as hotels, car rentals, and gas stations. GoShare releases the hold immediately upon payment of the final bill or upon cancellation of the project. While most card issuers release the funds within minutes of the hold being released, some banks may delay releasing funds for one to two business days. Unfortunately, this is at the discretion of the card issuer and GoShare is not able to influence how quickly they release the funds for use after the hold is lifted.'}<//Response>
<Name>Destiny Oscars</Name><Review>At the last minute they canceled part of the job then still took the full amount of the highest estimate ($200) for the job that THEY canceled.

Then they charged me AGAIN for the job that was actually done in addition to the $200 they were 랃olding and then told me I had to wait 2-3 business days to get my $200 back ...so not only did I not get the job done, I have to wait for them to give me my own money back so I can pay someone to actually finish the job 游땨

The service sounds good, but the whole money situation needs to be fixed ...will not be returning as a customer</Review>< Pictures>

My request was picked up within 30 minutes of posting it.
My delivery pro (Daniel G.) was right on time during my delivery and pickup windows. Then he took extra precautions treating my new grill 랇ike his own and it arrived at my house on time in perfect condition.

The driver arrived early which was great. Initially the location finder put on the wrong address and I didn뗪 notice before I booked the ride. Immediately contacted customer service who fixed the problem without missing a beat. Great service even the folks at Costco hadn뗪 used them before and asked me to let them know how this worked out. It was great!< /Text>

One (1) piece of furniture moved by one (1) man in one (1) truck... Billed four (4) times with different prices for each bill... Two (2) bills already collected by Go Share and two (2) more pending.... Nice service, but not 4-times nice!< /Review>

I used GoShare twice in past 10 days to move several pieces of furniture between 2 places.  Both were great experiences.  The app is simple to use (think Uber).  I liked being able to track the progress from arrival thru completion on the app site and to be very specific about the moves - so there was clear understanding of the projects.  The men that accepted the projects were experienced, friendly, strong (one sleeper sofa was extremely heavy!), on-time and masked due to COVID. I was able to customize the tip after the jobs were complete. I've recommended the service to several friends and recommend without reservation!!  I heard about it from Home Sense and think many other people would use the service if more knew about it.  I haven't seen any advertising for it.</Text>

I went on the app at 7:30 p.m. when I was at dinner and the delivery arrived at around 9:15 p.m.  I asked for a 9:00 p.m. arrival so it worked out perfect.  Delivery person was friendly.<//Text>

When he arrived he was clean, well groomed, personable and professional. His van was new and absolutely clean. I was impressed. When we arrived at my home, Michael help move the mattress in. All in all, a great experience. I will immediately call GoShare for my  next delivery of large items.<//review>< Name>

<review>We used your service for the first time to have a heavy piece of boxed furniture moved from store to home.  Getting an estimate and scheduling the service on your website was very easy. The chat feature helped when I had questions.  The driver called to inform me of of the expected arrival time at the store.  They delivered the box (275 lbs) and carried it to the second floor of our home without marking the floors, walls, or the box.  The job was completed in the time estimated on your site and at the time scheduled. We will certainly use your service in the future.< /review><gmap_id>0x80d954a468814545:0x1ecb4bef01b7c668<//gmap_id>< response>

This is uber for moving items. It is very convenient and everything is managed with a single app. The price is very competitive and I would recommend this to everybody in need of a van or something bigger for delivery. I did my moving contactles, you can also tip the driver if you want directely from the app. I will use this again for sure.<//Text>

For a project that I requested 2 drivers, one arrived an hour late. He completed 1/4 of the job that was requested. I reached out to the company and they took off a measly $20. They 띿isciplined the late driver but did not sufficiently compensate me for this loss. Expecting a customer to pay more than the job뗩 worth is ridiculous. I could뗬e called a family member or friend for free if I wanted my job done at someone else뗩 leisure.

It뗩 really disappointing to learn how GoShare handles business. The way this matter was handled truly shows that the company does not care about the customer뗩 experience. There will not be a next time for me booking on GoShare and I will not be recommending this company to anyone else.</review>

On a very busy Labor Day weekend, GoShare saved us after we couldn뗪 find a single truck to rent for a simple van load of stuff from our house to storage. Emyll came early, and was so friendly and professional all at once that we were done with the move before we knew it. Thank you GoShare! We will be using you for all of our local moves in the future.</review>

<user_id>113543936588134386972<//user_id><name>Todd Cheng<//name><time>1576281647208<//time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Please be suspect of their claims in 딸nsured coverage, that their pros will 딿roperly secure the load, and it is 'protected by GoShares cargo insurance policy.' There is no amicable resolution when stuff is destroyed. This has been raised by several impacted customers. One example below.

At 7 pm I arranged the movement of a hide a bed from about 25 minutes from my house. It was my second time using Go Share and I requested a driver and an assistant agent to move a couch. We got a great deal on a hideabed. I was excited because the first time using GoShare was perfect. The driver and assistant confirmed they would be there. 45 minutes late the assistant was not there. When I called the assistant said 딾h oops he can be there in another 45 minutes or more as he was not tracking the time. The driver was there and waiting. The driver said cancel it and move it. About 20 minutes later a Go Share rep called and apologized for the failed assistant and asked if I needed an assistant. The driver confirmed no. So we hauled it to my house and attempted to shove it through a door tearing the couch and ripping the wood off the door frame. The couch was not wrapped or protected. The mover persisted to shove and you could hear the tearing. It was now late and I was exhausted. Rough second use of the service.

I raised the incident to Go Share customer service that evening. The first action they did was to delete my account. Over the course of 40 plus days we went back and forth regarding the claim. They apologized for several dropped communications on their side. They had to have me send some information twice.

In the end they would not reimburse the failed trip that evening, damages, or the overall less than positive customer experience. The reason was my canceling the need for an assistant as the share voids there claim.  I suggest three of their online commitment should be updated and other customers be hesitant to trust the claims in broad strokes. I suggest if you request assistance and they are going to be 1.5 hours late while you are paying the other mover you think twice about canceling the assist. Though it cannot be found in their insurance statement online, this act voids any damages the mover might cause.

"Our delivery professionals take extra care to protect your cargo and deliver it in the same condition that it was received. If an accident does happen, you can feel safe knowing that your property is protected by GoShare뗩 cargo insurance policy"

"The GoShare pros will load, secure, transport and unload your items. You just tell them where you want them to put it."

"All GoShare delivery professionals are backed by our commercial
insurance"

In full disclosure I have used their service again and am now trying other similar services. GoShares overall has not provided a similar misshandling. However, I have found some of the other services easier to trust.

GoShare - no I did not drop it, your mover was the human shoving it through the door as my wife and I cringed. Yes, he ripped the couch and damaged a door. As you noted in your final response the claim was voided when  you chose to proceed with the project instead of waiting for a replacement contractor, you took responsibility for potential damage to the item.

Respectfully a torn customer<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1576210299370, 'text': 'Todd- We are sorry for your disappointment. Unfortunately, the second delivery pro canceled this project at the last minute. This is an unfortunate situation and our customer service team did everything they could to assist. You were given the option to cancel or reschedule. But, you agreed to proceed with the project and provide additional support and muscle. Our insurance protection extends to any work done by vetted contractors using our platform. The mover you hired was highly experienced and top-rated. There was no damage or tearing to the doorframe. The item was damaged when you dropped it. And, unfortunately, we are unable to purchase you a new piece of furniture to replace damage caused by a customer.'}< /Response>

Terrible. Just terrible. The quote provided was a third of what we actually ended up owing, and now we are finding tons of broken stuff in our boxes (probably due to the guy apparently not knowing how to use a dolly.)

We are very displeased that this move ended up costing us nearly 400 dollars. Never again. Do not waste your money. The quote isn't real. Go with a real company.</text>

<Review>The delivery was fast and the service was super nice but that was the driest pizza I've ever had. It broke in half trying to fold it and even with extra sauce it was hard to get down. TBH I'd try it again though for that price lol<//Review>< Time>

I have been to several different Pizza Hut restaurants and this one is the only one that doesn뗪 ask for your telephone number for the Hut Rewards. When I asked Valentine (which was the worker who took my order) why is it they don뗪 ask for the telephone number his said we just don뗪. He also said to get your Hut Reward point you have to order online. I would have ordered online had I known what exactly I wanted before leaving work but I was driving home from work by the time I knew I wanted Pizza Hut. I wasn뗪 going to order online while driving, so I order at the Pizza Hut store. What surprise me most is they have a sign on the counter stating Hut Rewards call-in,online, or in store but I guess that doesn뗪 apply to this location. I won뗪 be coming back to this Pizza Hut location. The food was good as always.< /Text>

This pizza Hut is on point! The pizza is always great. Meaning the right portion of meat vs. Cheeses and sauce, cooked at just the right temperature, and still hot when it gets to your door. And the delivery drivers are always super sweet. The ordering process is super quick and easy too. The only bad reviews on here are probably because people called at peak or closed hours. So too bad for them:/  Also the condition of the restaurant, but I've never been in so I have no idea what it looks like. Ignorance is bliss!</Text>

Ordered carry out, was told 10 mins, took more like 30, got home and one of the pizzas had a big bubble of just dough in it.  I don't know why they still have it to me like that, It's not like they didnt notice, I mean some one took the time to cut that horrible pizza. Didn't realize how the pizza was until I got home and was not about to drive back to request a new pizza be made.< /text>

The pizza arrives on time usually and always the right order.  Nothing really spectacular here as it is just your everyday Pizza Hut.  Would be nice to get a quicker delivery if you live within a quarter mile though.<//Text>

Everything was excellent but the customer service. Not even a smile or a polite greeting from the night crew, I think they need to improve on that.</Text>

<Text>Called at around 9:45 am to see if they were open. Someone answered and they were extremely rude. I asked them if they were in service at the moment and they said No!.  I then ask them what time do they open. And they said in the rude annoyed voice 10am . I honestly believe that she was almost going to hang up on me. Poor service!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2998e26e0be81:0x55c6460330ea75cb</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Just found out this place closed down when I drove by today. I've been going there for 30 yrs! So sad, the food was amazing, the staff so friendly, and I'll miss the ambience and memories. I even checked to make sure they were open before stopping by and it said open! 游뱂游쓇릦<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Great experience for my first visit.   Flavorful and inexpensive Mexican lunch buffet.  It's even cheaper than El Torito.  The food quality is good and tasty.  Options are limited but enough for you to choose from, and it will fill you up.  I came for their weekday lunch buffet 11am-2pm for $11.99.  Drinks are not included on the price.  Buffet includes menudo, caldo de albondigas, chile rellenos, rolled taquitos, chicken fajita, enchiladas, rice and beans, chile verde con carne, pork carnitas, salsa, pico de gallo, and much more.  Service staff are very helpful and friendly.  Plenty of parking.  I will definitely come back again.</review>

I don뗪 know how this place has 4.5 stars. When I went during lunch hour (what should have been the busiest time) there was only two other people. I ate some of my sisters plate and I didn뗪 even make it home in time to throw up. Now I have to wash my car.<//text>

Use to be a great place to eat. The last couple times I been here, the food hasn't been that great. Great and friendly staff. It needs an update, as it is very old. Pricing is good and the food option is good as well. They need better cooks.<//Text>

The service was quick and friendly. The burritos are huge. We each ordered one and we could have shared and still had leftovers. I ordered the pork burrito and they brought a chicken one, but were very apologetic and quick to replace it. I'll go back again!<//review>

< Review>
Casa Camino is a friendly restaurant with a big menu, happy hour from 2 till 6 pm. They serve big portions of tasty food. I enjoyed a burrito Colorado which was good. The happy hour Margarita's don't have very much tequila in them. We liked the regular one, were you could taste the alcohol. I advise to ask for more tequila in the Margarita's or you will end up, sipping on some sweet strawberry ice water.</Review>

The weekend buffet here is so good. With plenty of options, from freshly made tacos, enchiladas, to menudo.</Text>

THIS PLACE IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!  If I could leave no stars, I would. There was a TOOTH PICK in my dads beans, a HAIR on my sisters fish and my 랁ajitas were pure grease. All we wanted was to take the fish off the bill because we didn뗪 even touch it after seeing the hair but when they refused to give us a refund AFTER taking back the full untouched fish, we decided to also be petty and bring up the toothpick that stabbed my dad in the gums. The lady immediately LAUGHED when we told her and refused to give us any sort of refund. I will never return. Hear my plea  -  DO NOT COME HERE.< /review>

To the Flores couple and their friend that gave this business one star.... Google reviews isn't a forum for entitled adult children to have a tantrum because a table wasn't available to be saved for you. You were either late 10 minutes for your reservation or you called them and wanted a table giving them 10 minutes notice during one of their busiest times. In either case that's on you not them.
Have a great day.
Having that been said. The food is delicious!</Review>

LOVE This place!   One of the best authentic Mexican buffets I've ever had. Even better on the weekends when they have a Fresh Grill making omelettes , pancakes and tacos.  The enchiladas go fast!!  Even have fresh ceviche  (shrimp cocktail) in the buffet.
They're buffet hours are daily 11am-2pm</Text>

The only complaint was that it was so uncomfortably Hot! Seemed like there was no air conditioner working! Maybe they should install some ceilling fans.I think this would help! Otherwise Their Food Was Great!! I Will go ther again!!游꼾驕됋릜럻릜괧릜</review>

Worst manager! Very unprofessional!! Got mad a me for bringing to his attention that we were charged too much!! He got mad at us for questioning the reciept! Will never go back! Please check your reciept!! Before you leave!! I feel sorry for the employees who have to work for this guy!! Food is fine and the services from waiters and waitress are exilent. Too bad we wont be back, especially since we were told not to come back!!<//review>

<Date>1572140804041<//Date><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>We came here for my dads birthday. It was about 20 of us, they were good at accommodating us. The food was horrible though, we ordered the parrillada marisco and the chef, it was dry, overcooked, chewy and COLD. We though it was just us seeing as there were 20 of us, figured someone's food would be good. Out of morcajete, enchiladas, mojara, chicken nuggets and a few more items i think only the French fries on the chicken nugget order were OK. They don't seem to be trained to cook for a lot of people and its not like the restaurant was full, it was us and maybe 4 more people in the restaurant until the end when a few more showed up. The waiters did not come check to see if we needed refills or much of anything, we had to wave them down.  Restroom are right next to the kitchen which is to me not very sanitary and the restrooms smell like mold, i mean horrible. You really think twice if you really need to go because the smell is sooo bad. I have been to different Mexican restaurants and ordered parrilladas and this is by far the WORST place to eat mexican food. Will not be coming back, do not waste your time and money.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I have been eating here for over 30 years. This has always been the most authentic and best tasting Mexican food that our family has enjoyed. It is well known to the locals for their delicious lunch buffet. Prices are fair and service is Great! If you love Mexican food this place will soon become your favorite restaurant!!!</review>

<review>It was extremely busy...They don't put bleu cheese dressing in their salad bar so if you want some you have to pay an additional charge of $1.50 Every salad bar I have ever gone to has bleu cheese dressing as a choice so I think this is absolutely crazy to be charged for it!!!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Amazing all you can eat buffet with classic dishes and a treats they make to order like omelets and waffles. Reasonably priced and an upbeat atmosphere. Very family friendly.  Great place to take family during the weekend.</Text>

<Review>Delicious Mexican food. Taco bar, omelette bar, freshly cooked pancakes, menudo, pozole, beef and fish soups. Salad bar and fruit and deserts too. Churros with yummy filling. Crunchy tacos, enchiladas, and flautas too. Chille rellenos and fresh ceviche. Wow and other yummy dishes. We went for the Sunday buffet or you can sit in the bar and order from the menu. Great service too. We will be repeat customers many times!!</Review><username>James Juan<//username>< GmapID>

The chili Colorado was not like any other that I've ever had. It was not a spicy red sauce but rather a bland creamer sauce. We won't be back. Service was okay, but we were about the only diners.< /review>

We came for the lunch buffet (10-2) and thoroughly enjoyed it. The line for the breakfast food (omelets, pancakes, asada etc) was pretty long). There were flautas, tacos, enchiladas, chili rellenos, carnitas, chicken fajitas several soups (our favorite was the seafood soup). The service was friendly.< /Text>

<Text>This place sucks worst place I've ever eaten food had no flavor what so ever and even worst it was greasy as hell.... my sister made a reservation and they didn't have our table ready  I didn't want to leave a tip but our server aren't to blame for the food quality or size of the place... I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone</Text><gmap_id>0x80dd29b1c6b28097:0xdab7fc180b3a492a<//gmap_id><username>David Navarrete< /username>< rate>

Disappointed,  take long to ask for our order, the soup was cold, a flavorless guacamole, they forgot that my order included shrimps. I know this place for over 15 years and this is the first time I had a negative comment about it.< /review>

< review>
I've been here multiple times, but only had their coffee which is a bit on the sweet side. I finally had their breakfast and went with the breakfast quesadilla. It was better than I thought it would be, but it wasnt the best breakfast I've had. My wife had the French toast and that was also very good. Their bread was thick like Texas toast and personally I love that! Overall it was a good spot to have b-fast.</review>

The tacos are good. Rice and beans a little plain but add salsa to them. Reasonable prices.< /text>

<review>Delicious Mexican food. I recommend their Filete a la Veracruzana, carnitas enchiladas, or chimichanga and the mango margaritas. Great family friendly location. Good for groups.< /review>< Pictures>

IF I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE 0 STARS I WOULD! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! THE MANAGER THERE (OR AT LEAST WHAT HE CLAMIED TO BE ) HAS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS. WONT BE COMING BACK HERE ANY LONGER.  SAID HE COULDNT SAVE A TABLE FOR US WHEN WE WERE LESS THAN 10 MINUTES AWAY. WHAT RESTAURANT CANT DO THAT? TERRIBLE SERVICE!</text>

Great place to eat with more than one location.  Not generic food.  Great food that's a cross between Mexican and Cuban. Large portions at very reasonable prices--  actually lower than expected.  Excellent staff.  They will even make things that aren't on the menu, so don't be afraid to ask.  I always get the Carne Asada plate with an order of fried platanos ( bananas).  They'll fry them plain, or add cinnamon and sugar.  They are wonderful either way and its always enough that I can take home leftovers for a complete meal the next day!!   They have a special lunch menu and a lunch Buffett. So far haven't come across anything that I wouldn't order or recommend.  Best Mexican restraunt in southern California, in my opinion.< /Text>

<review>Today, I went to one of my favorite haunt's when I was passing thru Anaheim. I frequently revisit a restaurant/Deli that I enjoyed previously.
Today, my mood led me toward Margaritaville (maybe hearing it on the radio
had something to do with it...do you think?)

Damn subliminal messaging worked again!
Anyways, I sat at the bar and said to the bartender "I need a damn good tasting Margarita like I'm use to...he smiled and said that he can make it happen.

He brought me my Margarita and said to taste it because I came in at a good time.
After sipping it twice (I wanted to make sure before I spoke.)
I told him that it was a damn good tasting Margarita and will enjoy the rest once I decide on what to eat.

It was at this time, that he handed me a small bar menu which had several different "Happy Hour" food selections that all looked delicious.

After deciding on the Burrito with the chunks of pork which was marinated with a green sauce inside. I asked if it we're possible to make it "Wet with the red enchilada sauce"
He said no problem because it automatically is served that way.

Circling back to when he mentioned about coming in at a good time, he told me the wet burrito was $7.00 and the Margarita is only $4.00..such a deal.

I responded with a smile and said "that is incredible and let's get this show on the road.
It was about 10 min.that passed and he was already bringing out this large wet size burrito (with ez on the melting cheese.)

Let me tell you, that I enjoyed every last bite as I slathered some sour cream on top. I took a breather for about 5 min. and then finished off the second half with equal enjoyment.
I want to thank the bartender who worked the early afternoon shift for making my visit an enjoyable one. As usual, I'll be back.
Thank you!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I have been there several times. My husband and I love the  chile verde that they have everyday for buffet.  But every time we have gone  we get really bad customer service . The waitress and a waiter have no good customer service. This last time I went I was having menudo So the waiter saw me looking at it and he asked me if everything was ok ? I said there are 2 small hairs in my menudo. He said well it's a buffet what do you expect !? I didn't say anything so he said give me the plate because my sure your not going to eat it anymore!. My husband and I just looked at each other and dicited not to go there any more.</text>

WORST COSTUMER SERVICE EVER! THE MANAGER THERE NEEDS TO TAKE SOME COSTUMER SERVICE CLASSES BECAUSE HE CLEARLY NEEDS THEM. WE ASKED FOR A TABLE IN ADVANCE AND THEY DIDNT WANT TO GIVE IT TO US. ONCE WE ARRIVED, THEY KEPT GIVING TABLES TO OTHER FAMILIES. TOTALLY IGNORED US. THE MANAGER BASCIALLY SAID HE DIDNT HAVE TIME FOR US AND HE DIDNT CARE WHAT WE NEEDED. WON'T BE COMING BACK HERE ANYMORE. USED TO BE OUR FAVORITE PLACE TO COME AND EAT AS A FAMILY, BUT NOT ANYMORE.</review>

< Review>
New cook, disgusting food, I had a rotten chile, over cooked steak (and I paid for Ranchera and it wasn't), disgusting guacamole, and the pico de gallo tasted bad, even the rice wasn't fully cooked. The person who contacted the owner told us that they were sorry  but the cook is new. I understand that ,,, but a cook new or experienced shouldn't serve rotten food and they gave me $15 gift certificate, we paid $45 for that disgusting food, and I would like you guys to check your "To Go" orders before you leave premises, don't get a bad surprise like I did<//Review>

It would be better if you could extend the buffet hours,2pm it's too early, do it until 3pm at least.</Review>

Changed my rating from 2 to 4 stars.. We returned to Casa Gaming yesterday even though I had previously said I wasn't going to return.  This visit I gotta admit the food was very tasty. I ordered a soft Carnitas taco, enchilada on the dinner menu (there menu is extensive). My meal was very good. They serve chips before we ordered; the chips were thin, warm and the taste is excellent. The salsa is good; I add Pica de Gallo to add flavor to chips and my meal.

Before this recent visit I said:

The food was okay (about 3 stars). The interior is also 3 stars, exterior 2 stars.

Big problem with this restaurant (my visit) though, the margarita was terrible. Even worse than the terrible margarita was when I mentioned it to the manager he did nothing to make me a happy customer, not even offer to take it off my check. That reflects very poor management and showing me that he evidently doesn't care if I return. I had taken a small drink and asked the person I was with to taste it also. I asked him to look at the margarita, taste it, but he wouldn't do either. Both of us (his customers) agree it was very bad.

I was a bit persistent with the manager just how bad it was.."the worst margarita I have ever had", I told him. The waiter when asked about the drink told the manager with a shrug that it was a "Happy Hour" margarita...does that mean they serve bad margaritas during Happy Hour?

A side note on this is that one member of the family does like this restaurant and dines there fairly regularly; it reminds her of her family outings (but she drinks wine not the margaritas). She had warned me that the margaritas were bad.. I am sorry I didn't listen to her. I mean, how can you mess up a margarita? She said, "I love there food but I order a glass of wine, they can't ruin that).

In one other visit, I did like the Buffet.

I am not returning. Also, I can't recommend this restaurant with poor management because poor management is unacceptable.

Yes. i am originally from texas. This place is very comparable to some of the best mexican restaurants in south texas. Very good food. Everything from the enchiladas, flautas, and caldo. Cheap and authentic. Can't beat that.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Very good place to go to eat, have dinner whatever you say. Sometimes it is a bit crowded but nothing to see, it is obvious that if the place sells good food then it also has to have good customers.
