<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>My wife and I are very impressed with the work SEO Tuners have done for our construction company. Since hiring SEO tuners we are getting a lot more leads off of google searches within the first month actually.

Also Our point persons Jeremiah and  Elliot have been really efficient and professional with informing us exactly where we are with rankings and what their next goals for us are per each month.

We will continue to use SEO tuners as we've seen a drastic change in lead traffic since hiring them.

Highly recommend SEO Tuners!<//Text>< pics>

<text>We have been using SEO Tuners as our white-label SEO service provider for years.

Elliot, Chris and the rest of the customer support team has been outstanding to collaborate with on our SEO projects. Their process has been streamlined from the get-go from choosing relevant keywords for our campaigns, to sending clean and easy to read onsite instructions and providing ranking reports monthly.

Being from an agency background, we are constantly pitched and emailed SEO companies trying to win our business. We have consistently used SEO Tuners' team for their stellar service and extensive knowledge, and great rankings for our clients. Highly recommend SEO Tuners, their team and their service.<//text>< Pics>

This company is legit. It's all in what you know. My rep was Frank and I was honestly truly happy with his service. Highly recommend. Honest, Fair, Safe</Review>

I am a small firm with a limited product, SEO Tuners did a great job, much improved from before.  Most of my keywords are #1 in only 4 months
Great Communications and fast service.  I have put them on hold for now because I don't have any other keywords I need #.  If there was a 10 star option I would give them 12 haha.

Will use them again</review>

When we found you on page 9 of Google we thought you could use some help.  All you had to do is ask the person not to call you again.  Maybe try contacting a few of our reviewers and and see if they are fake.  If yo have the time to write us a bad review without doing business with us then you must have time for that as well.  You will find that these are real clients on here and are actually very happy with our work.  I have made sure that you are not in any of our systems and you will never receive a phone call from us again.  Sorry for any inconvenience.'}<//Response>

Everything from customer interaction, removing unwanted posts, generating daily content was deftly handled, giving our online presence a very well needed boost.</Review>

<review>At our midsized company we have worked with SEO tuners for a little over 2 years. They are a professional firm with guys who are not afraid to do the research and put in the work to create opportunities for advancing your website and your keywords in the search engines. Whether you are small looking to establish a new website, or you have some hard to cement keywords you are looking to move to the stop spot, stand pat, or incrementally advance, they are affordable and professional. In a world of tons of SEO companies and no guarantees, the staff at SEO tuners are a most welcome development, and they will always rank highly with me.< /review>< time>

In spite of all the other positive reviews, I was not happy with the work of SEO Tuners.  They were hired specifically to increase our page rank in Google.  Jeremiah persuaded me to go with their content network as a quick way of getting backlinks.  This is more of a grey hat method, and I was not truly comfortable with it but decided to give it a try.  Examining the pages where our links showed up and the content they wrote about our business, I mostly found myself hoping none of our potential clients actually saw that content.  We also paid extra for additional SEO work, and very little was done beside the content network.  There were some very low quality backlinks created in profiles at some membership sites, a few minor edits on a couple of our web pages and that was it. At the end of the month we got a very simply report of what had been done, and it was pretty much just a site audit with some recommendations.  I asked when do we get the report of the work actually accomplished.  It finally came over a week later, and was just the low quality backlinks mentioned above.   A couple days after the automatic payment went through on the second month I contacted Jeremiah and said we wanted to cancel.  He said they did not give any refunds and that was in the contract we signed.  Fine, I understand that.  After another week I asked him to remove us from the content network, and after the edits I saw they made to our web pages I reverted them back to their original form and removed SEO Tuners access.  Mostly, this was a waste of $2800.  I tried the content network and did not like it, and that is okay.  I do not believe they did hardly anything beyond that to justify the other $1400 we paid them for work beyond the content network.  Their methods may work for some, but I don't want the image of our company associated with the kind of work they do.<//review>

<Review>SEO Tuners's wonderful team has always been professional and prompt. They are all easy to work with. Most importantly, they are effective. Our Google and Bing rankings risen significantly since signing up with them over the past 2 years, and website traffic increased accordingly. Besides standard SEO techniques, they also have backlink cleanup and their own network to further increase rankings.

Every month, they provide a detailed ( and honest!) ranking report that shows if your site has risen (or fallen) in rankings.

Billing and invoicing has been 100% smooth, with no problems.</Review>< pictures>

We had got SEO Penalties on us through a search engine. That’s how bad our previous company was. But SEO Tuners helped us in SEO Penalty recovery. They guided us the reason behind drop in traffic and what all happened and even changed the content to suit our requirements. It is worth the partnership.< /Text>

We worked with SEO Tuners about 6 months ago. We are a niche magazine cover wrap marketing company and staying one step ahead of our competitors is crucial. SEO Tuners helped us improve several of our Google rankings and made our site "Google" compliant.

After the initial work was completed, we switched to a more user friendly web developing site. In order to keep all of the back end CSS work that was done by SEO Tuners, we had several issues to manage. They were always very helpful in explaining how we could transfer all CSS from the previous site, and took the time to walk us through the process. We were very pleased.

Nothing personal towards the gym. The people get on equipment coughing, sneezing without covering their mouths, it is not cool. These member's don't wipe of the machines when their done. Covid is a real thing and that's why the gym says where a mask indoors. Be respectful of next person, regardless if vaccinated or not.</review>

<text>This place has everything. Free weights, machines, pools and my favorite the cross fit room upstairs. I challenge myself daily.

The members here are always friendly. We share our work outs with each other. Not like other gyms.

Natomas Cal Fit seems to bring out the best work out people in the area. Great looking people because they try! Makes it fun and motivating 👍🏼💪🏽</text><gmap_id>0x809ad63f32802865:0x1b68640d1e25d64a<//gmap_id>< resp>

It's amazing how cal fit adapted to the Covid situation! I honestly love the outdoor experience a lot more than the indoor gym. Fresh air, no weird smells and it's safer while Covid is still around! they had a 14 days for 14 bucks offer and I signed up for that. One thing I'll tell you is to make sure you read before signing the documents they send you. I almost got fooled into signing a year contract. I wouldn't mind signing up if I wasn't moving next week. Overall great experience!<//review>

While my regular Cal Fit pool is closed, I get to venture out in search of options.  The six-lane outdoor pool is in the back, so it's a bit of a hike.  Who cares?  In the middle there's a kiddie pool with a slide and other water toys.  It was empty when I was there (February) but as soon as it warms up, expect the gleeful yelps of unbridled children splashing and screaming at the top of their lungs with their parents.  The Aerobic Pool, for lack of a better word, is inside and substantial in size.  The set-up here is ideal for those who like to get  into the water.  The staff is awesome and this facility is clean and well run.<//Review>

This gym has many machines, big space. This place is always busy. It's not clean inside. Showers are dirty. Water inside tub is dirty, sometimes has black color. Sauna is full usually. No papers towels usually. Lockers rooms are dirty. Parking is not safe. Everywhere at the floor you can found a dust. Did you think that gym is for health? - no, you will breeze that dust.<//text>

I have went in and told the manager to cancel my membership three times because I don’t workout here anymore because of corona virus. The manager assures me that my membership has been cancelled and that I won’t be charged again and that they have placed a request for a refund. I have three refunds pending and have not gotten a single refund and just got charged again today for the third time when I don’t even go there. Is this ethical?< /Review>

My 1st day so I need to reserve judgememt..im coming from a very nice, clean club n this looks like there been deferred maintenance and perhaps short staffing due to circumstances...we will see. Staff very nice so far but Im still missing my prev club...

**Going on 9 ? months later n I am enjoying my experience here...swim laps regularly and take a Tabata class I love..now that they are opening up it will be time to add more. I still miss my gem of an old club but it's gone, damn shame but the staff here has been wonderful, thank you for helping me make a surprisingly tough transition!</Review>

My wife and I been a member here since last year,we absolutely love the place. Great environment with everyone doing their own thing, they also provide one on one personal training. There's a kid's club for kids while parents train, an indoor and outdoor swimming pool plus a sauna as well. Upstairs is mostly designed for cardio while downstairs is for heavy training. Our contract is still the same when we first signed up and we're very happy with that. We train 3 days a week, spend about an hour training then we're out.< /review>

If I'm not mistaken but everyone is supposed to have face covering. Me and my Son walked in yesterday and found the staff walking around and at the desk with their mask hanging off their face and 90% of the members working out with no protection.

<Review>As a former employee i know all the cancel policies yet have still been unable to cancel due to having emails ignored and having to wait over 15 minutes in club to speak to a manager.

I tried to ask about cancel and freezing before COVID closure and 2 emails were ignored and 1 in person drop by was not handled. Now I have been charged for a gym I can't effectively use just because they put a few pieces of equipment outside.

I tried calling my club today and received no answer, this is 4 attempts of ignored communication, 2 prior to COVID closure an email after reopening was announced and now a phone call after being charged again.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>An ok gym but there is no way to cancel your membership. They make it impossible to get ahold of them and you can't cancel online. I highly suggest finding another gym unless you want to pay $150 for the rest of your life. I moved out of state and have been trying to cancel for months now. Also a employee told me all there positive reviews are written by employees so don't fall for them. They also have lots of hidden fees they lie about. I was excited about the gym at first but have sadly been very disappointed. They make it look so great until they have you in a contract. There are so many better gyms out there dont even waist your time with this one.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Very clean facility, nice people, machines everywhere upstairs and down.  I’ve been a member for about a month now and I’m really happy to have chosen this place.  I really like the 4:30 am opening time because I’m definitely a morning person and this works for me!   5 stars for sure.

<Text>I was a member at this gym for years and had to cancel once I moved to the Bay area. Upon coming back to Sacramento for the summer, I sat down with a CalFit representative and was hoping to get a good deal (without yearly contract) just for the summer. I was promised a discounted price. He said if I had any problems, i could just call him directly. I was unfortunately charged the full price (no discount) and took it up with the same representative. Apparently he lied on my application and said I had some kind of insurance which later backfired. He apologized and created a second account for me, claiming he can fix the mess and save me some money. That fell through as well. After this he ignored my calls and I decided I won't go to this gym anymore.

I'm giving 3 stars because prior to this I had a good experience going to this gym, but I'd be wary of any discounts you may be offered by a CalFit representative to get you to sign.

PS: This place is a lot more crowded than it used to be, it's even a challenge to find parking in peak hours.< /Text>< response>

I enjoy the atmosphere here. People are friendly. I only wish A. The machines were labeled better. Some have no labels and others have been rubbed/peeled off. Especially for some upper body machines and for beginners in general, proper labels are helpful. B. The men’s locker room was better taken care of. The trash cans are often over flowing and it smells horrible and is very humid. Some air fresheners and a dehumidifier would help a lot.< /Text>

<Name>Ernest L. Phillips</Name><review>The staff is cool. The patrons, not so much.
The plated weights are always in disarray. That's due in part to not having many places to put them, but mostly because folks suck at putting weights back in a logical manner. This place needs a better leg press machine that can accommodate real weight and enough plates to do so. They also need to put the plate rack back by the hammer strength machines, because dummies are mixing all the weights on the same rack next to machines. Finally, get some EZ-curl bars with fixed weights.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>NEVER GO TO THIS GYM, THIS FROM A PERSONAL TRAINER. I’ve been to plenty of gyms in my life as a personal trainer, but none had as poor customer service and sales as this gym.

I recently tried to cancel my gym membership due to a move. When I initially signed up for the membership a sales rep at the Natomas (Sacramento) location, named Robert, who assisted me explained multiple times that if I chose to cancel after 6 months due to a move there would just be a small fee of about $5.  I specifically mentioned the location of where I'd move too. He of course failed to mention that there were additional requirements to obtain this small fee.  As a sales rep he is there to explain the contract and provide accurate information, not lie to get a sale.  He initially misled and cares more about the sale than the customer.

To make matters worse when I tried to resolve this issue, I spoke to a manager by the name of Brian at the Natomas location. Brian clearly lacks customer service skills too, he was defensive and lacked understanding.  I would not waste your time with this location, there are plenty of other quality gyms in the area. As a personal trainer I recommend gyms all the time to clients, but I will never be recommending this location.< /review><gmapID>0x809ad63f32802865:0x1b68640d1e25d64a</gmapID>< Response>

And my kid is not an easy one ;) Tyler and Armando are really great employees!! You can tell that they really care about their jobs and the club and guests! There are a lot of people who go in and out of there every day and it's really clean when you consider that.  The cleaning ladies are even sweet...I have nothing bad to say about this place< /Text>

Most cycling teachers are great. I really enjoy the instructors Marji, Elizabeth, Sandy and Dave. They really know how to encourage you and motivate you to do your best. They get on their bike and really show you what to do and demonstrate everything including sweating. I have taken both morning and evening class and Wow!!! I feel great after these classes.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1532983105831, 'text': "Hello Esther.  Thank you for the wonderful review!

<Review>Very nice gym, equipment is nice and staff is nice too. The price is what made me cancel tho, 50$ a month plus $30  per additional member and $15 for guest each visit. It’s never that serious. This just seems like it’s in place to maintain a certain demographic.< /Review><gmap_id>0x809ad63f32802865:0x1b68640d1e25d64a</gmap_id>< Time>

<Review>I am giving the Natomas gym 4 stars because it's a good gym, both my husband and I enjoy this place, I enjoy the different classes, and my husband enjoys the fact that there are lots of different equipment to use, like every other place, there are the times when it's pack and there are times when you have access to every single piece of equipment. 2 things though: wipes always seems to be out, water fountains in all areas are many times slimy and dirty, it's nasty looking. There needs to be bigger signs letting people know not to jump in the pool coming out of the sauna/spa all sweaty, to please rinse first!!
One more thing:: I know that its all about business, but I had a free hour with a trainer and asked to meet with one as I wanted to see about learning specifics for some areas, the young lady that meet with me, spent 17 minutes total, and I know this because she, herself mentioned this, saying "WOW, look at this, we only spent 17 minutes exercising upstairs and see how you feel?" well, the rest of the time she spend it giving me prices and telling me why it would be a good thing for me to pay a personal trainer, and she was good, almost got me with her pushing, needless to say, I guess I am being owed a 43 minutes free session with a personal trainer for my specifics as she did not even hit those I asked about.  Pricing its good.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< name>

Worst customer service.
For the second month they did not provide me an employee discount.
When asked, been told there is a form that needs to be submitted online. Told no body informed me about that. And they took a xerox copy of my id at the time of the sign up. When asked for the xerox copy back, they told it was shredded.
What’s the point of Id xerox if I have to submit employment eligibility online ?< /Text>

<text>I came in to see about joining and asked for a tour .
I was greeted by 1 of the 2 employees behind the counter. I was asked to fill out a card and have a seat in the waiting area. While waiting I could see employees walking around as well as arriving. I continued to wait as they started gathering at the front desk. There were about 7 employees standing there and no one came over to assist me, so I left. I was walking in parking lot when an employee walked out and yelled at me if I needed any help. At this point I was done waiting and left. From reading the reviews I can see why people are complaining. Staff need better supervision and training . This location needs Safety, Cleanliness and Staff that are eager to help. Too many Gyms to chose from. This location gets extremely low marks for Customer service. Thank you<//text>< gmapID>

< Review>
UPDATE: received a call from their corporate office, who took the time to explain their policies to me and more importantly, took the time to listen to my whole experience. Rating upgraded based on this most recent customer service.

-original review-
They make it hard to cancel, like a cable company. I went there on 8/27 to cancel my contract. The lady processing my cancellation form for me said that I could use the gym until 9/14 and then we'd be done with no further charges.

I just noticed (9/18) that I got charged again on the 14th. I called Cal Fit to talk about it and got passed to "customer care," and the lady I spoke with was incredibly unhelpful and kept stating "Well you didn't read the fine print of the contract!"

I said "I understand what you're saying, but can you understand why i'm annoyed? The lady that handled my cancellation stated that I wouldn't be charged again," to which she replied "Well I wasn't there! And you didn't read the fine print!"

To current members: PLEASE READ THE FINE PRINT, and make sure you cancel ONE MONTH BEFORE YOU WANT TO STOP USING THE GYM.

To prospective members: their membership, contract and cancellation policies are no better than your average cable company (read: poor at best). If they work for you, then great, but please be aware that they won't make cancellation easy and will do whatever they can to charge you that extra month at the end.

To Cal Fit, if you want to discuss this review please ensure it's not the same lady I spoke to on the phone. I'm kicking myself for not getting her name, but if your goal is to care for customers, she's doing an abysmal job.</Review>

Ashley the club supervisor is absolutely amazing. I called because I am moving to a town that doesn't have a cal fit, let alone a gym at all. I have also never used my cal for membership in the entire almost year and a half I had it. I have another gym membership too, and it just ended up being more convenient as it was near my work. Anyways, she completely took care of me and was so kind and understanding. She also made it so fast and easy. All the staff at this gym have always been so accommodating and kind. I would definet oh recommend this gym, you don't find staff at gyms like this very often anymore. It's always more about money than it is costumer service, unfortunately!</review>

What I most like about CalFit is their friendly staff. When I walk in the club, I am frequently greeted by first name (even before I sign in). Also, the staff is always available and the are very easy to talk to. Any issue or problem that I have ever had with club, was always solve to my satisfaction and followed up with an email or phone call. I have been a member of many fitness club and hands down, this is the best club that I have ever been a member of.<//Text>

<review>we experiensced that we can not use for what we pay. my kids /2.-7/ years old and me came about 6.30 p.m. to the Natomas pool.  First the indoor pool was prohibited for us due to class. We tried to use outdoor pools. One of them was really cold, other was not enough heated. this pool was also not for us as the calfit worker said. we tried to warmed out in the spa or sauna. this is also prohibited by rules. we were informed that class sessions in this time 4-5 times per week. We pay for membership mostly because of usig pool. half of indoor pool was not used by class participants. may be ok to share it in such situation? for what we pay?< /review>< pics>

They don't even deserve one star. I wish I would have looked at their reviews before I signed up for a $1 for one month tryout membership. It seems like they are use to scamming people and providing 0 customer service. Gyms are suppose to provide health but this gym has only caused me so much unnecessary stress. An employee who no longer works there came to my school and signed me up for a $1 membership to try out gym and said I could cancel any time during the first month if I didn't like it and receive my $1 back. I was rushing off to class and said that I don't live in the area I just go out to school out here. I told him I'm a mom and don't have time to spend at the gym or money considering I do not have a job and am a full time student. He said just try out this one month for one dollar and if it's too inconvenient for you we will refund it. I told him I'm running late and he said just sign this this and this. I have not been to this gym once and called and emailed to have them cancel my membership before it rolled on to another month and I was emailed back saying that hey signed me up for a one year membership and to cancel I would need to pay $300! I reached out to Jesse who is apparently in charge of memberships. He said he would waive the $300 fee and cancel my membership. A couple weeks later they charge my credit card of $300. I am so furious! I called all day yesterday and left messages and asked to speak to Jesse or a supervisor and they said Jesse was on lunch for three hours and apparently never came back since he never called me. I have spoken to so many people and nobody can help me? I feel that my baby and I have been robbed. What kind of company will allow someone to be charged $300 for a gym they never even stepped foot in, especially when the workers are all liars and will do anything for their commission. I'm so disgusted. Do not go here and waste your time and money. They are scammers!</Text>

Inside Pool water is too cold to swim. Not only  for kids, but even their own employees shiver in the pool.  I complained to the swim manager for the cold water even she can't do anything because the "big" guy in the corporation doesn't want to fix the problem. The swim manager manually checked the temperature and it came very low. I will cancel my membership where nobody is there fix the problems.< /review>

Has a dirty feeling when you come to pools and saunas, so far this gym is last out of all family fitness centers I've been too. 2 stars because only this place has open rinse shower next to pool and saunas, otherwise I'd give 1 star the most</Review>

Someone dropped a deuce in the shower or emptied their kids shorts.
Ghetto Family Fitness!

Small details count! The management is inept and don't enforce the simplest hygienic rules  and common courtesy.

People routinely come in from the pool, dripping gallons of water on the floor of the locker room, so everyone  can stand in while changing. Simple towel rule an easy slam dunk.< /text>

No refund processed still after 5-6 weeks.
I posted review on other sites for same, got response there but still manager who processed cancellation, and suppose to call me on same day of follow up call, didn't call so far.
...Check cancellation and other policies before you sign up.
Also how much you will really use it but dont take this as discouragement from being fit and exercising.....if gym motivates to you, it is worth.< /Review>

< Review>
I was a CFF member and was utilizing this (Natomas) facility for about 5 years. There was a period of time, when my wife and I have stopped utilizing this facility. Due to a number of life-changing events, we ended up canceling our membership, after having it on a freeze for some time. Now that we have more free time again, we are thinking about joining a fitness club, and I was even considering going back to CFF for a minute. But, as I’m reading through reviews - it’s like a flashback!!! By now, I already fogot about all the issues we have had with CFF in the past; from bluntly rude/ unprofessional members of the management team to all the issues related to the process of canceling the membership (CFF kept charging our account after we have already cancelled and had the proof of membership cancellation. And yes, all this was happening after they already charged us for the “last month” fee, with respect to the contract. We had to go through hell and back, just so that CFF stop charging our account and issue us a refund, which they did, after giving us a good runaround.)
First of all, i wanted to thank all the members for posting their reviews, which have served as a great reminder of why I would not wish to reestablish my membership with CFF.
Second, it’s a shame that CFF keeps treating their Natomas facility and its clients this way. By the way, there were some exceptionally amazing employees at this facility, but just like the proverb says, one bad apple spoils the barrel...
And last, but not least, as I’m looking to sign up for a new membership, I have visited a few Fitness Clubs / Gyms in Natomas area, and was pleasantly surprised to find out that there are so many different options, that offer much more friendly and professional personnel, far more inviting facilities, and at a way more reasonable prices.

I hope you find the experience I have shared in this review helpful. But more importantly, stay healthy, stay motivated and always take good care of yourself!

Best of luck
-Adrian

P.S. I can definitely confirm, that majority of the 1 and 2-star reviews you read about this facility are not just a bunch of angry haters, dramatic and unfriendly individuals, who fail at basic communication - these are some real experiences of people just like you and I.<//Review>

<review>Sexual harassment alert! Discrimination alert!
I have been a member of Rocklin Warren Drive CFF for 12 years, 2 of my boys were practically raised in kid care. I have brought staff fruit, cookies and candy over the years, purchased merchandise. I am clean, modest, fitness loving woman who actually likes to not be a bother and workout to close to people to give them space. I am friends with many of the instructor, elderly people, fellow moms and long term staff there. I get daily high fives from other members saying that I am the most influence they ever had there and that they find me inspirational. They said my smiles and kindness come through. Today I was emotional abused and have never felt so unsafe in my life. The manager Nick Duncan told one of their staff members named Megan a newer employee flag me down after exercising during one of the slowest hours of the day. I do my cardio where I never even have a neighbor and find mats in the body dumbbell area after women have already left. Megan when on to tell me that the manager didn't like me breathing. I immediately asked to speak to manager and felt crushed and confused. Nick Duncan (the manager) when on to meet with me and he told me he was offended by my breathing and didn't want me to breathe basically. I immediately felt threatened and I have never been sexual harassed like this in all my 12 years of being a member there. He made me feel like a sexual object! This is where I go for my peace of mind workout and I consider this place a sanctuary for me. I am having extreme anxiety now and I feel like this location is not safe and CFF doesn't protect its members.< /review>< Pictures>

<Response>None<//Response><Text>We have been with Cal Fit since they opened many years ago. While the wife does more exercise then I do, I tend to talk a lot, meet a lot of very nice people at this Gym, and enjoy active and very interesting discussions.
Trevor who is no longer at this Gym, was one of the best greeters I have ever met. Marissa, who had replaced Trevor is a very close second. She is bubbly, sweet and very nice to all customers. Brandon the Manager, is attentive, takes time to listen to the very rare concerns at this Gym, and is always open and available to discuss anything you need. A special Thank You to Corey for helping me out on a couple of things. He is a Trainer that I admire and always strive to be like physically, unfortunately at my age it will take quite a bit of work and perseverance. If anyone could make me, Corey could. I have to mention the environmental staff that keep the Gym clean and sparkling. We take for granted that the Gym is always clean, floors nice, equipment really clean and we rarely say thank you to the people that make this happen. So I officially say Thank You to Juanna and her staff at Cal Fit Northgate.
Last, the environment is always welcoming, People are always friendly, customers and staff inclusive, and it is just a nice place to go and get a bit of work done, or get a freshly made frozen fruit slushy, made by the more than capable hands of Marissa, in the early morning when we workout. Brandon, Thank You for managing the location with care and fairness to all your employees. You set the tone and pace for the location, and we like it.

Disrespectful staff of liars. The sales department is filed with buff guys and pretty girls all trained to give customers the old bait and switch when it comes to prices and membership. The mens locker room smells like sweat and filth and the rock wall is not available to kids and members most the time because staff is not manning it or willing to. Save your time and money and go where you are treated well. Please notice when you read a negative review of this place that it is followed by someone making the complete opposite regarding the facility. I truly believe management at the gym makes efforts to cover negative post with fake positives post.< /review>

Benches are cheap(something you buy at sports authority) no deadlifting station and the weights are slightly squared meaning when you touch the ground the bar moves in two diferent directions.

The good is the pool the sports and good for family. But if you want serious lifting this gym is not for you its mostly for families and older people.</text>< Pics>

The experience is wonderful, the fact that this gym is like no other gym that I have been too. It is pretty big and has many things other than the exercise equipment that all of us members can use.< /Text>

<review>Do NOT BE FOOLED
WARNING
The gym staff will show you around and brag about the facility and will tell you that racquets are provided but guess what , they only have one racquet for the whole club ..
Childcare isn't great either. The child care staff makes a face as if they are about to cry , when they see a child being signed in. The teenage staff has 0 or no experience handling children here. Or they would call you every minute or so to tell you to pick up your crying child. Well like i said , the staff is incompetent and cannot care for your child. The membership fees is also ridiculous for the service they offer and membership cancellation is 350$.

Lol seriously am i signing up for a cell phone contract here ? Are you subsidizing anything for your members ?</review>< pictures>

<Text>I love it, good variety of equipment staff is friendly, and answers any questions i have. Just like any other gym, it's busy during peak times, but they have plenty of space and many machines that work the same muscles so you can still get a good workout in. Many friends go there and they love it too<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<date>1461342677267</date><Text>I agree with all the negative reviews. Cal Fit Sales people are full of lies and deliberately omit important information. Like for example, I asked, if I move to an area where there is no Cal Fit, can I cancel. They said , yes, you only have to pay a small fee of about $40. That was fine with me because its a small fee. What they didnt tell me is that if you cancel before 6 months you have to pay a lot more than that. Also, they said sign up now , and if you later become a student we can give you a discount for being a student.  What they didnt say , is that they extend your contract as soon as you get that discount. Overall, the weights are decent 3stars for that. But sales people are liars and managers are cool with that cause they cant help you with anything. Enroll and Fitness Systems, way better gym.< /Text>< Name>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I have been with Natomas Racquet Club for the past three years, I switched from California Fitness for poor service issues. My contract with NRC ended last month and before renewing I decided to give Ca Fit another chance. I went to their website and noticed a 7 day free trial offer. I signed up for the free Trial and before heading to the Natomas Cal fit, I called to inquire about bringing in my two boys for the free trial. After getting few different answers, I got hold of a supervisor and was told Kids were welcomed. Upon arrival I met with Diana V. in sales and she immediately went into her sales mode and started giving me the "We have a special deal this weekend" speech. I explained to her that I will decide after the 7 day trial. She punched in my name in the her computer, and explained that she could not offer me the 7 day trial since I was a previous member back in 2011. I asked her to find that policy on Cal Fit website and after trying for few minutes, she agreed that the rule is not explained on the Cal fit website and that she could not do anything for me since it was "corporate policy". My issue is not the stupid corporate policy, my issue was the fact that I was not told when I signed in or when I called. A simple check box asking if I was previously a member could have saved me the trip and my kid's frustration. Was it an over sight? I think it was a perfect bait and switch technique. I left Cal fit and headed straight to Natomas Racquet Club. I signed for another year. Everyone was happy, even Diane with her corporate policy.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>I wish i could rate this gym a zero. Both my husband and i met a sales person at the fitness expo we signed up for a 5 day trial. And we were told to cancel with him so we dont get charged if we decide we dont like it. Ok perfect so we thought we would give it a try. Unfortunately we live and hr away from the gym and commute to work so we weren't able to squeeze in one day. So on the 5th day i went in person to cancel the membership, i spoke to a gal there i told her it just wasnt going to work out for us that i needed to talk  lto the guy that signed us up. She said hes not here but no worries i will make a note in the system that you are cancelling you acct. Perfect!! I left at ease thinking i was not going to be charged. As i going through my banks statements which i rarely do i keep seeing a monthly charge of $94 on my acct. I called the gym and the gal that had put the note was a manager and she said the note she put in there stated "I was TRYING to cancel my acct" not that it was cancelled. And that i have to go in person (drive an hr) and sign a paper to cancel, or go through corp but that it will take longer. So she added up the months and ive been charged $94 for 6 months already and they cant refund it. (Mind you, my husband, kids nor I have ever gone) Very unhappy at this point. Will stick with planet fitness from now on. This is ridiculous.<//review>< Pics>

If you join make sure you do not sign anything for the trainers my son did and then they started to charge him $80 a month for classes that he had no idea about.  They said it was for the free training. Then I went to cancel my membership because I have a health  problem and I knew it would cost me to cancel it was $175 well they charged me twice for it.  So they will rip you off anyway they can.  Just be careful.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Lousy customer service. 3 kids standing around on a Saturday doing nothing and not one person is available to help with new membership.   Why is this place being run by what are most likely college kids instead of professional adults.  I took it as a sign that I should just pass on the expensive gym since I don't use most of the stuff anyway like basketball,  kids club, climbing wall, outdoor kids water park.  The only good thing is they obviously have a ton of equipment , pool and jacuzzi(but still a small free weight area).< /Text>< username>

The gym is often dirty.  Many.lockers not usable.  Overall quantity and variety of machines is good.  Billing practices are dishonest.  Rates are changed despite a contract and without contacting the customer.  It is not an inexpensive membership; customer service is poor as related to the fees.  I will be recomending my company disassociates from this company.  Now on hold for 34 min waiting to speak to someone at "corporate headquarters."  Used to be a good experience, but has sadly degenerated.  Avoid their pressure tactics.  Don't join!< /review>

<review>Thiefs and crooks.

It was almost the end of my membership term, I requested my membership cancelled at the end of my contract, they charged me for another month and didn't ask, when I asked them to fix it, they said this is how it's going to be and totally refuse to refund money that I never authorized them to charge. Still trying to fight this theft, probably will have to get a legal battle.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

When my wife and I signed up they convinced us to add our two young children to the family plan so they could use the club and also so we could drop the kids off at their "daycare" for up to 2 hours a day while we worked out.  Well the moment the kids cry over anything their teeny-bopper employees call you instantly and request you come to the daycare and take care of it, even if it's just minor, all because they don't have experience with kids.  If you're going to staff a daycare, employ people who know what they're doing with kids.  It was a total scam.  The staff is also generally rude and poor customer service.  I wouldn't go back to this place if you paid me.<//review>

<Review>i went in with my girl since this place is close to our house and right away they want your personal info before even getting a tour!

when someone finally came over to take us on the tour the took us over to their desk and right of the bat started going over memberships.  i was like ummm we asked to go on a tour of the place and thought that would come before trying to sign us up?

well we got taken on a speedy tour by this girl that talked so fast that we couldn't understand anything she was saying. then before the tour was over i was already getting emails from the place which is very annoying.

they sat us back down and went over the membership rates. i gave in and signed my girl and i up for memberships with the 1 yr contract which was 109 a month which i thought was quite costly.

they had me sign on this little screen attached to their computer like 12 times and i had no idea what i was agreeing to?   i asked and the girl was just telling me it was just the privacy policy and card info etc etc

they never showed me any contract or agreement and just took copies of our id's, took pictures, and then charged me 175 for the first month and deposit.

well its now 4 days later and i get the contract emailed to me with the digital signatures all over it. i read it and I'm not happy with it at all and wouldn't of signed it if i was shown it when i was signing up.

basically it states they can change the membership price whenever they want.  also they aren't liable for ANYTHING and you can't sue them for ANYTHING even if its their fault.

if you go and read the reviews you will see they aren't great. many people complaining about those fee increases and poor customer service.

i also read that they have a 5 day grace period for canceling your membership and getting a full refund.  this is prob. why they wait 4 days to mail out the contract to you in hopes you don't see that clause in time and are screwed.

the early termination fee is like 275 dollars and thats nuts if you ask me

when i went in to cancel the guy asked me 2 times why and if he could help and i just said i don't agree with the contract and don't like the reviews i read online. he called his manager and then gave me a piece of paper to call corporate.

well i asked for the manager and he said he just stepped out. i was like how convenient since you just talked to him via phone. i guess they didn't want to try to keep my membership by possibly putting me into a non contract membership at a special rate to keep us. its clear they don't even care about you.

i stated that i now know why the reviews are so bad and walked out

got ahold of corporate and the nice lady there helped me cancel and was confused as to what type of membership they even had me on.  she didn't know why they didn't have me sign the actual contract and why they never showed it to me and emailed it out?

anyways were going to 24 hour fitness downtown where they have no contracts and prices are cheaper.  plus they have great reviews< /Review><user_name>James J< /user_name>< Pictures>

<Gmap_id>0x809ad63f32802865:0x1b68640d1e25d64a</Gmap_id><Review>Very underhanded contract process.  Make sure you get names of employees you talked to and the time you talked to them and hard copies of everything you signed when join up there.  At the "end" of your contract, they make it very difficult to leave.  You have to get a cancellation paper a month before your contract "terminates" then physically bring it in two weeks before your contract "terminates"   It can't just end and your bar code stop working.  It has to be a ridiculous pain in the ass.   That is by design to keep your money coming to them in the event you forget to go thru their hoops at the end of your contract.</Review><Time>1509307975125< /Time><rate>1</rate><pictures>None<//pictures><Name>jwd jwd</Name><UserId.>115769752179789214828< /UserId.>< response>

am furious! It is impossible to get a honest or accurate answer out of any the staff. There needs to be some type of standardized training on the rules and regulations of the facility because it's very clear the staff have no idea what they are talking about and it is at the guests experience and expense. To top it off, I was promised I wouldn't come across any more problems or fees by a manager who is no longer with the company! I was told by the current operations manager that I'm basically S.O.L and that the email provided doesn't necessarily address customer service issues. I ended up paying more than my monthly membership to leave this gym. It's a shame dealing with fam fit is such a headache  that I would pay to not use their beautiful facilities. Shame on fam fit and their owners.<//Review>

I visited the California Family Fitness Natomas location to join the gym to get healthy with my husband and kids. They offered me an awesome deal. I pay 59.99 a month single and 109.99 for a family of four. this includes admission to the Kids Club which is daycare for kids while the parents work out. great right!! and on top of that offered my husband and kids 30days free and all I would pay is first month and last month for myself then after 30days the normal 109.99 would apply...Sign me up that's great.(now last year I had been a member of the club and I stop going and was billed for months I didn't use the service but according to the gym I had an old balance so they were willing to forgive the debt with paid membership)me and my husband have separate bank accounts so we split the payments on two separate card transactions. which caused an issue with the system but according to the manager everything went thru correctly. Hubby paid 64.99 and I paid 64.98 and we left the gym later that night with a new gym card for me and my hubby.the next night I get an email from my bank showing a charge to my debit card that was on file with California Family Fitness for 129.99 in addition to my pending charge of 64.98. I contact CFF and they said that they only see the charge for 129.99..ok now there is a problem apparently the rep who signed us up and did not process the membership correctly. I asked why I wasn't called and they had no answers. I was also told that I needed to pay an additional 49.99 because the sales rep forgot to charge me a processing fee which can normally be waived. Frustrated with the lack of answers for the CFF club location I contacted corporate who said that they could refund me for 14.00 if the 64.98 charge processes or I will need to pay an additional 49.99 if no they will cancel account. IF YOU INCORRECTLY BILL ME, CHARGE MY ACCOUNT UNAUTHORIZED. THEN ASK FOR MONEY WHEN MY ACCOUNT IS OVERDRAWN BECAUSE YOU ARE HOLDING MY FUNDS HOW DARE YOU. very upset about the unauthorized charge.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

My watch was stolen at the Natomas Cal-Fit location by an employee. The watch being stolen wasn't address for almost two months. Although I called and followed up. I continually called every other day to the Natomas CAL-Fit and the downtown K street location where my original membership began. The watch was turned in by the employee Kathleen who admitted the watch was given to Management until her co-worker gave a her a grimace look as to say you should have said that. Kathleen then begin to get amnesia all of a sudden. It was too late at the point. I continued to question Kathleen as her co-worker continued to scowl at her. Here I am a 50 year old speaking to some young girls that are my daughter’s ages.  Kathleen begin to perjure and couldn't remember who she gave the watch too (how funny). In addition I spoke with various employees Shauntel and DeAngelo all who stated there wasn’t a watch in the lost in found. Along with that DeAngelo stated the more valuable articles picked up in the gym is place in a safe by Management (Kate Spade would be placed in the safe). Kathleen who was upstairs has stated she turned the watch in downstairs.
I called the Manager Brock over 15 times in one month in regards to my watch and he never addressed the missing watch. When Brock appeared to address the situation somehow Brock no longer worked at the Natomas location as a Manager. The watch is a Kate Spade design, sentimental gift value was never a factor.  I am baffled that a multi-million dollar company as Cal-Fit never addressed the situation. After multiple calls to the Orangevale Corporate Office. Sad world we live in today!
It’s funny how I received multiple and numerous calls and text as Cal-Fit solicited their membership promotions, but only one call about my watch which to this day has not been addressed. Not one return call from Corporate Orangevale Office.  This review didn't deserve a star, if you don't select at least one star you can't send a review. Natomas Cal-Fit doesn't deserve a half of a star.< /review>

Natomas Cal Fit has the best classes and instructors. I live in Roseville and drive to Natomas because of this. The Roseville and Rocklin locations don't have much of a selection in the times I can go. I've been with Cal Fit for years now and rarely have any problems. Staff is always friendly, but the classes are the best around.</Review>

Staff here is horrible to deal with.They cheated me 99$ by saying they ll give me trainer. They say they can only give me group classes after i signup, Now they wont refund my 99$, and t training team guy, who claims himself to be the boss, says he cant refund, but he ll give me tshirts and ballons. They said, i did no read the terms and conditions. Who on earth ever went through that. I thought we run based on trust , and this training team boss is ridiculous. Now they want me to write a letter to them, asking for refund. They are just making me run around by holding my money.</Review>

micro managing and disrespectful. so i go to swim with my 12 year old step daughter. heated pool is taken by a class. we got kicked out of the jacuzzi which i understand i didnt see the age sign. so we go to the lap pool to swim laps. a lady comes to us DOESNT EVEN TALK TO ME just speaks to my daughter and asks her how old she is and says she has to get out because some child break time. which is fine i get it except im literally RIGHT NEXT TO HER and im 21. she cant swim with her guardian right next to her? not to mention they didnt even LOOK at me when speaking. i dont if its because im not black and she is or what but it was extremely rude. never coming back.</Review>

Very convenient for quick and decent volume meal.  Got more vegetables as fast food and large drink to keep you hydrated.  Fries can be aged a bit depends on your timing.< /Review>

Terrible waited 5 mins for 2 items. My order wasn't even right either, order spicy chicken no mayo add Sante fe add jalapeños. I got a spicy chicken with brown lettuce and bun. Nothing else. Order was correct on receipt. Terrible service will not answer their phones either. Do not go here .</review>

The best Carl's Jr in the bay area. I literally drive further just to come to this one instead of the Carl's Jr on the corner of fremont Blvd and Thornton. The later one being the worst Carl's Jr in the bay area. Always go to this Carl's Jr off Thornton in Newark because the other one is straight up garbage.<//Review>

Pretty Decent for fast food. Price is a little higher than most fast food chains but the size and taste make up for it. Tasty burgers great fries even zucchini rounds! Fav is the western bacon burger. That tangy sauce gets me. Super thick shakes too< /Review>

They have everything Alcatraz, from T-shirts with great pictures and sayings from Alcatraz's storied past, to playing cards that teach prison slang in between hands of poker. Striped pyjamas for the kids are a hoot. If only they sold the ball-and-chain to complement it.<//text>

History of it is amazing! Half of the audio didn't work in my group of 7. Tickets are expensive so I'm not sure why they didn't spend money on the tour people with mics. if they fix this it would be worth every penny!< /text>

Great selection of Alcatraz themed novelties.  Probably over priced but you would expect this from such an historic place.

On the day we visited they had an ex guard, 92 years old, singing copies of his book which was an added bonus.</Review>

(Translated by Google) A gift shop like many others, in terms of internal organization, prices and type of items, as they can be found in every tourist place in the United States.
But here at least many of the gift items such as t-shirts, sweatshirts, mugs, bottle openers, magnets, hats, etc., etc., are particularly funny because they are based on the theme of "Alcatraz escape" ;-)
Shop easily accessible, on a raised floor, large and bright.
Excellent availability of all sizes, from newborn to over-size.

(Original)
Un gift shop come tanti altri, in quanto a organizzazione interna, prezzi e tipologia di articoli, così come se ne trovano in ogni luogo turistico degli Stati Uniti.
Ma qui almeno molti degli articoli per regalo come magliette, felpe, tazze, apribottiglia, magneti, cappellini, etc., etc., sono particolarmente spiritosi perché basati sul tema della "fuga da Alcatraz" ;-)
Negozio facilmente accessibile, a un piano rialzato, ampio e luminoso.
Ottima disponibilità di tutte le taglie , dal neonato  all'over-size.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) This shop is unique and funny, selling striped alcatraz prison clothes. Not only sell alcatraz items, this place also sells gifts such as key chains, fridge magnets and so on. The location is inside Pier 39. Somewhat up to go to this place. Prices are rather expensive

(Original)
Toko ini unik dan lucu, menjual baju-baju tahanan ala alcatraz yang bergaris-garis. Tidak hanya menjual barang-barang alcatraz, tempat ini juga menjual gift seperti gantungan kunci, magnet kulkas dan lain sebagainya. Lokasinya ada di dalam Pier 39. Agak naik untuk menuju ke tempat ini. Harga agak mahal</review>

(Translated by Google) Awful welcome. They all do to make you pay in cash: ID required before you can use a bank card. It really smacks of scheming. In short, a very unpleasant experience.

(Original)
Accueil exécrable. Ils font tous pour vous faire payer en liquide : carte d’identité exigée avant de pouvoir utiliser une carte bancaire. Ça sens vraiment la magouille. Bref, expérience très déplaisante.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I don’t quite understand why everyone is so crazy about Alcatraz. When I came here, from the striped striped symbolism, the beginning was already rippling in my eyes. And to all this, the price tag for a dollar or two is higher than the rest.

(Original)
Не совсем понимаю, почему все так сходят с ума по Алькатрасу. Когда зашёл сюда, от тюремной полосатой символики аж в глазах рябить начало. А ко всему этому ещё и ценник на доллар-другой выше, чем у остальных.<//text>

<Review>Im sooo shocked and pleased with the new management of the  shop. Ive been coming to  this location  for over 8 years even before this was  a hair shop location.  Porsha  is definitely in her field of purpose. The energy  is soo inviting  and personable  but still professional  and im always taken care of in a timely  matter with efficiency.  I even had to let her k ow because  i was "mouth open" with amazement  at the place.<//Review>< Pictures>

They white label their wigs but not really. They just change the name and color code. So if you rather buy in person and you go in and ask for Jon Renau Scarlett, they won't help you. Even if you ask for it by name.  I understand brick and mortar stores competing with online stores but honestly if a customer cared enough to walk in and ask for a wig and color by name, if you obliged, you would do better business. It's a shame that a store closest to me has such crappy customer service .</Text>

We may not have this particular style available, but, we carry similar styles that you may be interested in trying.  Shopping for a wig or top piece takes time and patience, and for this reason we offer one to one service to all of our customers. Please pay us another visit and see what styles and service we have been offering to our clients.  We look foward to seeing you soon.'}</resp>

SO rude. When customers are polite and respectful and have a good attitude it's usually good business practice to be polite back - I think you really need to have a heart to heart with your staff about customer service and even manners or maybe recruit new talent, this is why companies such as Bellami and others are beating you, nobody wants to be treated poorly or give money to those who are rude.<//text>

This is the worst store I have ever been to. Customer service deserves ZERO stars. The store policy trying 3 wigs max, is pathetic. The hot day and no good air conditioning service made me very thirsty, and when I asked for a glass of water, the response was: "No water,  bring your own."  I do not wish to waste my time to write more negative things. I am done!<//text>

I came her for the first time even though 5live 5 minutes away, I never noticed this location its kinda hidden in the corner. But anyway?, everyone there was very nice and polite. They offered exactly what I asked for and I loved how everything came out. She even worked on my ingrown nail! Thank you so much for being so professional and very neat and helpful.  I will definitely continue to keep coming and recommend to family and friends:).<//text>

They are not cleaning the work stations after each client finishes a service during the COVID-19 pandemic. After completing my manicure the polish was so sloppy it looked like a 5 year old did it. When I complained I was told that it’s because of the top coat and asked to pay an additional amount to have it repainted. Save your money and go elsewhere. Customer service is horrible!</Review>

I've been coming here for a while, very clean and they are always friendly and do the best to please the customer. The reason for the 4 stars is because I went to get my mani done yesterday with an appointment at 1pm and it took them, literal 3 hours to get me started. It wasn't until I complaint that they rushed thru the other ladies. To their defense, the group of ladies before me had 5 manis & pedis, but the ladies had only booked appointments for 3 so it was taking them longer. Jenny did an awesome job on my nails(like always) but they need to work on their scheduling skills</review>

<Text>They took 2 hours just to do a regular polish . Had an appointment at 12:00 didn’t get helped until 1:20. They acted like we weren’t there until we said we were going to leave . Charged $50 dollars for acrylics with purple nail polish and no design. And nails were burning after  . Do not recommend<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Time>1561254067648</Time><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I went here for the first time yesterday, June 21st, keep in mind that i called beforehand and asked for the wait time and i was made aware that there was one person in front of me and i would me next so i decided to go there. I get to Alessandro location in Moreno Valley about ten minutes after the call considering i live down the street and there were five people in front of me not one but five. I decide to just look past it and wait there. I got my nails done then left. Later that day I ended up break a nail and today i called again before i went and asked them if there was a price and they said no and they’d be able to fix it. So again i arrive and they sat me and then said that it would be a three dollar charge but why didn’t she say that before when i called to clarify? I feel they are NOT true to their word and they are very rude. Also their selection of nail polishes are horrible. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk and I WILL NOT BE RETURNING. They also have very horrible time management and don’t take appointments but tell their customers to be back at a certain time yet still have them wait forever once returned and that was an observation i made while waiting my turn.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

When I walked inn nobody asked me if I needed anything, I had to look for a sign in sheet, and they didn't even notice until onother frequent customer walked in. They also took a very long time to get to me, and because they all seemed to be in a rush I feel I didn't get quality work on my nails. Also I had thet do a design with crystals and the lady had a hard time placing them on my nails, and its only been a week and most of them already fell. You can see the shape they left on my "almond shaped" nails. Some curved, some are too thick, and others have lumps.<//review>

OMG great job on my nails, felt relaxed very clean and my nails are still going strong. I will be back!!!! OK I'm here for a second time, I called for a 4 o'clock appointment and I'm still sitting here at 4:40. Never again. I'm here once again and nothing has changed. Horribly treated. Slow service, this place doesn't know how to manage there time or customers, very rude, ridiculous pricing. Only thing nice about this shop is the space. This will be my last time coming here.. I would advise anyone else not to come here......< /review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Worst nail salon experience ever!!!

I'm not sure how this is the first one star rating. Perhaps it was just the older lady that I had, but she did a terrible job and I was literally there for two and a half hours! (All I got was a full set) She kept filing my nails down to get them even and I left with an acrylic nail that was shorter than my original thumbnail when I walked in.

I wanted white tips but she talked me into doing the clear tips and she would just paint the tips white. She said that would "look better". They did not.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Coming from LA it was hard to find a good nail shop with great artist. I've been in Moreno Valley for 3 years, I tried 4 other places and Red Persimmon on Alessandro is awesome! I haven't been anywhere else for my mani/pedi, full sets and waxing(face and eyebrows ) since.< /review>< Pics>

< review>
My daughter's and I decided to try this because it had 4.3 stars
We walked in, it looks ok. I get to the table, there's a dirty towel. The girl pulls the sterilized tools from the machine, only to use the ones she had in her drawer. (I'm getting a mani) She files my nails and uses the buffing machine to remove dead skin. I ask her not to. So she removed the dead skin, then proceeds to color. (No buffing) Now a couple of nails look bumpy. What pissed me off the most, i didn't get my lotion massage!  As i was leaving, i notice a praying mantis on the lamp. Ugh!
One daughter (getting a full set) said her girl was too caught up on whatever program she had going on her phone. Not paying attention to her nails. When i went to check on her, the lady was talking on her phone.
My other daughter said she was fine with her service. (Getting a full set/pedi)
In giving 3 stars, just because most of the service was nice.<//review>

<Review>This is a great and affordable place to get both tattoos and piercings. Everyone who works here is professional and does their job very well, the aesthetic is amazing, and I leave appointments satisfied with what I get. I recommend it to anyone who wants to get either a tattoo or piercing.</Review>< pics>

<text>Walked in and everyone was so and super sweet. They got me in quick and The Dogfather Tattoo Company was super nice. I asked to do a constellation piercing and he customized my ear beautifully. It was quick and super clean. I'd definitely go again for my The Dogfather Tattoo Company.</text>< Pics>

I got a double helix with Angel. Im 14 and it barely hurt at all! She was so sweet and helpful and I wasn’t nervous at all! She made me comfortable and had we some interesting conversations! If youre looking to get a piercing this is the place!
Thanks so much Angel!< /Text>

I’m a happy canvas =) Jason Kim is the artist who did mine and he was just the coolest. He really made sure I had a good experience all around! In fact everyone at the shop was really nice. I’m really indecisive and asked him to redo the drawing quite a few times before we started, and even then I still needed some time to finalize it. He was pleasant the entire time. I’d definitely recommend him 👍🏽<//Text>

Kristel is an amazingly talented piercer. She's also very kind and pleasant to talk to. She easies your mind and makes you feel so comfortable with your experience. I'll only go here from now on for any piercing needs I have.< /Review>

My son and I got our first tattoos together. He's 18 and I'm 36. They were quick to get us in and let us schedule a time and day. They listened to what we wanted and delivered. I got a cardinal in tribute to my aunt who passed away October 5th. Both artists did an amazing job.< /Text>

One of the coolest most chill shops. Everyone is friendly and makes you feel comfortable. Found this place a couple weeks ago and my wife and I got a tattoo on a whim. Went there tonight because our teenage kids wanted to get piercings. We will be back for sure. Shop decor is so cool and the vibe is positive.<//Review>

Sean was super friendly and did an amazing job on my tattoo. Took about 2 hours but the results were amazing. I definitely recommend asking for him on your next tattoo. I was so pleased with the work and the people, this is going to be my regular tattoo place.< /Review>

<Text>My wife and I were very satisfied with their professional approach and quality workmanship. We were on a tight schedule and needed a quick turnaround, the owners were very helpful and we received the product the same day. Definitely recommend this company and we will use in the future. It's nice to know people still care about others nowadays.</Text>< pictures>

Ken was quick to respond and the design team was able to follow instructions from our Corporate office and get it right on the first try.  We got a couple of bids on the sign that we needed made for the front of our building and Fast Signs came in ahead in every aspect.  Definitely recommend and will use again.< /review>< Pictures>

{'time': 1608223794449, 'text': 'Hi Roland, Minimum orders are a standard in the print, graphics and sign industries many of our competitors are as high as $100 or more. The reason why is to protect our margins and keep the doors open. Example a single small decal that should only be $3 to $5, in order to produce that single item our cost in time and material can be the same as producing 15, 20 or more. You have to consider the time it takes to take your order, design it, send you a proof, load the material, remove the material, process the order, etc. as it passes through at least 3-4 employees, plus the material & disposable waste'}</resp>

Fast Signs installed window lettering and a beautiful window perforation for my new orthodontics office, Clarity Orthodontics. They were very professional to work with, and presented me with several proofs before install to make sure I received the final product I was expecting. Brandon worked on my project and his attention to detail and quick delivery of services was greatly appreciated! We will definitely be using Fast Signs for future projects and I highly recommend them!</text>

Fast Signs gave me exactly what I wanted for my fine art gallery, both with the sidewalk sign and with one that goes on the front of my building. They were able to give me the size and style of font I wanted for both. They did it quickly and with multiple proofs, working with me easily to create just the look I wanted.<//review>

FastSigns did a great job with production of multiple signs, multiple banners and a large full color art piece!  Their installers were prompt, professional and did a great job installing.  Vanessa is a wonderful person - easy to work with and very accommodating.  This is our third year ordering items for an annual event and we fully intend to continue using FastSigns for all of our needs.  Great people and topnotch quality.  Also, they really are FAST!<//review>

FASTSIGNS was quick to come and examine the job, give us a bid, and then accomplish the work.  When I raised some concerns about some stripped bolts holding the sign (not their fault, it was from previous installation of old sign), the personnel contacted their supervisor, who came within the hour and corrected the problem.  I will definitely use FASTSIGNS again for our needs.

I originally did have concerns about some communication on the service but my concerns were addressed by one of the owners Kim. I would refer my customers/family/friends to this company as they will address concerns you have as well as do everything they can to meet your deadlines on time. I prefer a family owned business such as Fast Signs because they will quickly take your sign requests and make them into a professional art piece that you can appreciate that is either on your wall or window. Give this company a chance to do your business signs because like myself small local businesses matter to the local community.

Just as their names says: they are fast! They are also friendly, patient and helpful. I emailed some designs with their graphics person and within a few hours I was walking out with a beautiful sign. But wait....I messed up and forgot to add something to the sign. I called the next day. They fit me in to their busy schedule and charged me very minimally for the fix. I will be back the next time our business needs a sign as they do a great job and take care of their customers. The owner was there both times and was very friendly and helpful!!! Thank you Fastsigns!<//text>

<review>All 5 star reviews? Lol , so I must say,  maybe service is amazing for purchasing a sign. “Spending lots of money” After that your on your! We currently have a situation regarding customer service since yesterday. Still have a burned out sign! I will update Fastsigns response to my customer needs. So far a NO STAR, if possible!!!

The girl the front counter seemed very uninterested in earning our business. She was more interested in what was on her computer screen, then speaking to me. I don't even recall getting a smile out of her. We will be going elsewhere for our startup business needs.< /text>

< Review>
Just like I say about my pet grooming business "you pay for what you get, good work isn't cheap and cheap work isn't good. Oh and I also say we groom the best and fix the rest! Well Fastsigns must go by the same motto because  they were awesome. And awesome people recognize other awesome people. You pay good money for a great sign in the amount of time they say it'll be done, they get it done. We tried going the cheap way first and got us an unprofessional con man. So we took our business elsewhere. FastSigns fixed our problem and came through with a beautiful sign exactly like we wanted it.  Thank you so much. I've started sharing my picture of the sign and people are asking where'd I go for my business sign, so I will be sending them to you.  Thanks again</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>2/16/15: What a pleasant experience! We put up a $1500 sign for our homeowner's association, and me and all the homeowner's couldn't be happier, esp after starting with another Fresno sign company. Vanessa did an outstanding job checking in with me and making sure I knew what all my options were. She responded within a day each time, sending over pics of numerous designs, giving me her recommendation for the best quality job. After we customized our personal choice by making a slight modification to one of their designs, she got this made an installed in a very timely manner. The sign is perfect. I can't imagine another sign place in Fresno that can outdo FastSigns.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80946631b087fa15:0x5ed3ac3e747f584d</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Purchased to 2  Box lighted LED signs from FastSigns Fresno for both of our Fresno offices. They were very professional from start to finish will continue to work with FastSigns in the future years to come.

Most garages will give you at least 15 minutes free. Going to a movie will cost something like $35. Also, there's NOTHING here other than a theatre and Cheesecake Factory. This place is a ghost town.</review>< userid>

A very well managed and well-organized shopping center. They have a huge variety of fresh produce. The other levels are full of high-end retail shops. Name the brand, and you can find a shop here. Also, the people working here that I came across are very friendly and welcoming. A must visit if you love to shops!</text>

I took my fiance here to celebrate her birthday, they did not validate my parking ticket and that ruined our night as we were stuck at the gate trying to exit for Wendy's mistake. Thanks Wendy for ruining our night, something my fiance will remember for the rest of her life. Gas, money and positive energy was wasted.</Review>< Pics>

Worth watching. Nice place to spend time. Surrounded with shopping places,restaurants. Along with this they have too many activities like ferries​,boat which can take you for ride. Good place to enjoy the evening and feel the nature.< /text>

Paul Mitchell School is a great place to have your hair pampered and fabulous place to absorb new and trendy fashion about your hair. Wonderful anti-hair loss products for your honey. If you are tight in schedule, great place to have all your beauty essentials done @ Galleria. Online appointment with European Wax Center. Appointments or walk-in @ Paul Mitchell School, which is a great trendy place to help and learn from aspiring beauticians. Then hit the gym @ 24 Hours. You can always modify the sequence of your appointments according to your schedule and preferences of action. PS...the estheticians @ European Wax suggested to finish steam room, which is my favorite activity @ gym, before going to their stores for services. Since pores are open after steam, it's not recommend to perform waxing procedures on skin because the likelihood of having infections at the open follicle pores. Steam treatment before waxing also helps hair removal. I guess less painful during waxing.❤️🈵❤️</Text><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

The Sherman Oaks Galleria was very cool to walk around in. It's a very nice outdoor mall with a lot of different stores and dining options. We went at night and everything was lit up extremely nicely. The fountain was also pretty awesome and it went with music. We went to a bunch of the pastry shops, as we were really there to look, not shop.<//review>

<Text>Beautiful, four building office complex with a shopping center and lots of water features. The center includes a few uniquely stocked stores and several upscale chain restaurants, some with patio seating.

There is a Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream Shop, offering vegan and conventional ice cream, and other counter restaurants.

A multi-screen movie palace, on the third floor, is excellent and has a good sit-down restaurant. Popcorn, too.

Attendant and validated self parking available.

Restaurants and the movie house validate. Most places offer some vegan and gluten free foods. Elevators and escalators are available throughout including the multi-story garage. Everything is wheelchair accessible.<//Text>< Pictures>

These are Clean theaters and they never reek of stale dead air like many other theaters!  Clean bathrooms to boot, a nice bar w/ small meals and seating overlooking the 405 parking lot 😂 Friendly staff and free parking, just remember 2 get it stamped. This small chain is above most other cinemas, a good experience!<//text><Name>D D< /Name>< Time>

They did a great job when they put FIGat7th together.  They have a variety of different restaurants to choose from including an entire food court.   There is a Target,  H&M, Lens Crafters, Golds Gym and many other places to shop.   There is also a huge parking garage and most businesses validate.<//Text>

<name>James Pikover</name><Text>An almost useless mall. The restaurants have limited views and the street noise from Ventura is annoying, even indoors. There's next to nothing to do there. Lots of kids all the time. Parking is in the back across from nearly everything worthwhile so it's a long walk to nothing. The only things with going to are cheesecake factory, DSW, and the arclight theater. After living next door to this mall and expecting it to be a fun place to go, I've gone 3 times and every time has been a disappointment. Go across the street to Public School instead.<//Text><response>None< /response>< Date>

I'm a country girl so this big theater is fun to learn to navigate. It's organized very well. The seats are comfortable. but back home seeing this movie would have cost me $15 for two people and here it cost $30. And if you get valet parking the charges $9 and on top of that you tip the valet so it's pretty expensive to go there</Review>

<review>When the earthquake happened and this mall fell apart I was hoping they would rebuild another mall there because it was really quite beautiful. Now they have cheesecake factory and a couple other restaurants and a DFW shoes.... For those of you that are disabled it's a long walk from the parking lot to restaurants or down stairs they have a furniture store or 2... And then of course the cheesecake factory which no matter how much you have to struggle is worth the effort because their food is always yummy and even if you split a desert you won't forget it</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

When the earthquake happened and this mall fell apart I was hoping they would rebuild another mall there because it was really quite beautiful. Now they have cheesecake factory and a couple other restaurants and a DFW shoes.... For those of you that are disabled it's a long walk from the parking lot to restaurants or down stairs they have a furniture store or 2... And then of course the cheesecake factory which no matter how much you have to struggle is worth the effort because their food is always yummy and even if you split a desert you won't forget it</Text>

Great that you have a Cheesecake factory here!!! The Ben and Jerry's ice cream shop is great too! PF Chang's and T-Mobile in the same place sounds like a good plan to me. Still a bit empty but it was a good option for spare time!!!</Text>

FIX YOUR PARKING!!! YOU HAVE 300 OPEN SPACES FOR VALET. MAKE SOME OF THAT REGULAR PARKING AND TOU HAVE 6 15 MINUTE PARKING SPOTS WHICH YA CAN MOVE TO THE VALET SIDE RIGHT ACROSS INSTEAD OF TAKING UP REGULAR SPACE.<//Text>

It's been 20+ years since I was last there. It looks awesome, wonderful, excellent. However I don't think it serves the clientel of old....like me. The upgraded look is Awesome, but it's just too high scale for me. Makes me wonder if THIS was what they envisioned all along. But kudos it's 10/10.<//Text>

More of a work place than a mall. However, there is a couple of places to shop, like DSW. There is a few restaurants, like PF CHANGS, Cheesecake Factory, Buffalo Wild Wings and more.

I work  in the Galleria and everything is very nice and staff is attentive. i appreciate management for all its help</text>

I love the fountain! It's the home of my Burk Williams Spa and lots of great restaurants! It's just minutes from our Heal and Soul Yoga studio so I get to be here often. It's 1 hour free validation for restaurants and 3 hours free for movies 🎥</text>

This place is strange if u're not used to it's setup, which I was not! I got lost and turned around so badly here, I asked a security guard to help me find where I'd parked, cause I literally couldn't! lol But the food was good at the Cheesecake Factory for my 1st time, and the rest of the eateries looked pretty tasty as well. The movie theater is very nice tho, I'd recommend anyone go see a movie in there and then check out the city on the overpass when you get outta the theatre. I think u'll like what u see.<//review>

<review>I enjoy coming here for a movie and dinner. The arclight theater itself is expensive, but it includes selected seats. The home furniture is also nice to walk around in. I never drive here myself and don't know the intricacies of parking but I know they do validate for 2 or 3 hours. I'm not sure if the theater validates or if it's just free for the first 2 to 3 hrs.</review>< Pics>

I have been coming here for years. They keep the place nice and tidy. There are limited businesses and after your movie or your dinner, there's not much to do here. Parking is abundant and vendors offer validation too. Love coming here for dinner at Cheesecake or a movie at the Arc Light.

Parking is expensive and so is valet so be prepared.<//Review>

The parking sucks. That is my biggest complaint. You get 4 hours free if you watch a movie, (2 hours everywhere else) but if you put your ticket in the machine you literally have 20 mins to leave, or sit in line to leave, or they will charge you $3.00. I know it doesn't seem like a lot but it is the principal.<//Review>

This mall is dying. Half the stores are empty. There is very little shopping stores. Mostly chain restaurants. Nothing special. The parking rates are egregious. Got a coupon to visit the indoor playground, but with those parking rates, it would have been cheaper to pay full price elsewhere.<//Review>

This is such a beautiful spot. Really nice to hang out with family, friends, or even have a date night. My friends and I come here when we want to hang out. The vibe is very chill. You can do some shopping, go to the movies, eat, or take a stroll. Really great environment and people are nice too.< /Review>

No more parking attendant at the booth. Please pay your parking using those machines. Super convenient. Easier and faster to get out the parking structure.

Higher levels always have parking spots near elevator.< /review>

This is very different from the Sherman oaks Galleria 20 years ago. now there are mostly restaurants that line this narrow shopping mall along side office buildings. Usually people come here to go to The cheesecake factory. Are also children's events every weekend. During the daytime many people go to the go to the gym, 24-Hour fitness. There's also a very expensive movie theater upstairs call the ArcLight theater. Parking is fairly reasonable although if you stay for a longer, they charge you.<//Text>

<Text>A place that contains anything you could possibly want! Food, clothes, businesses, entertainment? Parking easy but paid. Never visit during rush hour as it is directly on the corners of Ventura and Sepulveda, the home of the NIGHTMARE bumper to bumper, 405 on/off ramps! Otherwise great place and even hosts protests outside in front for high visibility! Check it out!<//Text>< Name>

You must come here for a destination, not really due to convenience. Movie theater, cheesecake factory, P.F Chang's, Starbucks, and Buffalo wild wings are the main stops that everyone comes for. 2 clothing stores, a shoe store and a couple others things reside at the galleria but nothing that gets more than 10 customers a day I'm sure. Overall, clean and classy.< /text>< pics>

Awful. All the Empty storefronts do not make for a pleasant shopping experience. The malls design is ridiculously inefficient and confusing.</Review>

<text>I have not been too this Mall for many years....1980's!  Parking looks easy. Until you actually have to park. You have to walk a long, long, long, long way thru the entire mall. I get it....they want you to check out the stores. But then you have to go through a wind tunnel. The theater also was very dirty! I would never go back....Not worth the time & effort!< /text><userid>117103326454220943186<//userid><GmapID>0x80c29794c8097071:0x83eca8ad4cef2f0</GmapID></record>

<review>Very clean and nice. Parking is expensive but it's validated for few hours if you watch a movie or eat at the restaurants. Huge parking structure so there are plenty of parking spaces, but expect LA pricing if you do not validate< /review></record>

A quaint, peaceful haven in the middle of the bustling city. There are plenty of places to eat around here, and you can have a nice walk while making your decision on what to eat.

The venue is very modern, and they do a good job of keeping the grounds clean and cared for.<//review>

I love coming here for my morning workout at 24hr. Fitness then breakfast at Starbucks, sometimes for lunch at smaller restaurant or dinner at larger sites such as Cheesecake Factory! I love their community room for pubic use, outside seating, and free 2hr-3hr. Parking. Very chill spot! Hope one day they can add a yardhouse or brewery like restaurant.</Review>

Thrilled to see 3 new restaurants coming in soon.  This is primarily a dinner and movie place, so the more food choices, the better.  The wind tunnel journey from the parking lot to the theaters is brutal on cold days but a godsend on hot ones ☺</Review>

<text>I absolutely love this mall. Bedt customer service ever. The have free charging docks at the food court for you to charge your phone while you eat. They are so cool, modern, password protected and free! I got lots of samples at the mall, was happy with my daughter who loved our shopping experience and after visiting several stores, we did not find one store sales rep that was rude. My new favorite shopping mall for sure!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<text>While it may not be as grandiose as some of the other Gallerias of Los Angeles Area, the Sherman Oaks Galleria has a memorable aesthetic.
From the water fountains providing calming sound throughout, the Hanukkah lights illuminating Ventura Blvd. during the holiday season, or the Arclight Cinema overlooking the 405 freeway's daily hectic races, the Sherman Oaks Galleria leaves it's mark at the gateway to the San Fernando Valley.</text>< pictures>

<text>I actually went there for the gym. I really like the area. I don't like the gym being inside. One thing parking sucks. Other thing is that 24hr fitness validates for 2 hrs only so you have to rush to get your workout in. But in general the area and location is very clean. The. Galleria has plenty of restaurants to chose from. A little bit of everything.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Given the name galleria I assumed this was a shopping mall. It is not. It is a strip of upscale restaurants and a Warner Bros Office. What the hell....? 12 dollars per hour for parking also. I ❤️ L.A.</Text>

This place has always felt suffocating and oppressive for me.  Whether it’s the building materials or the layout, I’ve never felt comfortable there.  This won’t stop my yearly pilgrimage to Burke Williams though!< /Text>

A large, fairly new and open outdoor galleria. Lots of shops and a decent number (and variety) of restaurants to meet many different tastes and occasions. Its parking structures are also easy to navigate, though parking can be moderately expensive (though often can be taken care of by restaurants).<//Review>

Everything you need from comfort food to a restaurant to a bar exists here +some other misc stuff.

Theater is a bit expensive but the 24hr gym makes up for it (cleanest 24 in the city IMO) and parking is reasonable with validation....the only way it could get better is if validation from the gym added an extra hour< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

I go here mostly to work out at 24 Hour Fitness and it's convenient because the gym offers two hour free parking and there's always plenty of space unless it's movie premier night then you park far away. The place is tiny with few establishments or real shops but people mostly go here to eat and watch a movie.<//review>

Really nice, well-maintained place to shop around. I like how you can pay for your parking at the gate and at a station in the mall. Beverly Hills doesn't do that. Good selection of stores. Didn't like the layout of the parking garage or the fact that unless you get valet you have to walk a while to get to your car.</Review>

Not the best mall in LA. There isn’t that much shopping. There are a few restaurants and a good movie theater. I give it four stars because I like the ArcLight movie theater and the location is pretty central to me and my friends.<//Text>

Nice outdoor shopping center. Plenty of eateries to choose from. Seems to be a mix of working business class people from the various onsite office  buildings, trendy shoppers and people going to/from the onsite gym. The architecture of the location is pretty nice as well. Worth a stroll through if your looking for something to do. Parking prices are a bit much, but I guess that's to be expected for the area.<//text>

The person that helped me place an order. Name not known but she had a sleeve on her left arm, was so horrible at customer service! She needs to find another place to workout or just end her career at CF for good.</Text>

<Review>Really nice, well-maintained place to shop around. I like how you can pay for your parking at the gate and at a station in the mall. Beverly Hills doesn't do that. Good selection of stores. Didn't like the layout of the parking garage or the fact that unless you get valet you have to walk a while to get to your car.</Review><Resp>None< /Resp><rating>4<//rating></record></dataset><record>

Last time my husband and I came we saw "It," though I have seen many movies here over the years. The customer service at the Arclight is fantastic and the whole cinema is very comfortable. Also, if you don't prefer to dine in the Galleria itself (which can seem kind of empty/lonely on account of the lack of active storefronts) there are other restaurants close by on Ventura.< /review>< pics>

Highly recommend the galleria...even if your alone it is in the middle of an always busy mall busy with bustling busy people ...great for mingling or people watching;) the galleria is also has many offices in and surroundind the the  Galleria. It’s a very popular lunch destination for many of these people who work there. Lost of shops and restaurants both fast food and family style.
Newest add into the Glendale galleria restaurants is Frida Mexican restaurant....Yummmmm. Also included in the line up is The Cheesecake Factory...PF Chang’s...pizza 90...and many more they even have a gym If you need to work off some of that lunch or dinner! Great experience ...great ambiance great food and drinks!< /text>

This galleria is great for high end food. It's doesn't have many stores but they have a few decent restaurants like P.F. Changs, Cheesecake Factory and Buffalo Wild Wings. To top the night off, you can head to the upper floors and watch films at the Arclight. Great theater but a bit pricey. Overall it's s great place if you trying to make a first impression.< /Text>

this is a good Marshall's. Great Parking.  This store gets a fair amount of higher end items due to the location.  Premium denim such as Paige,  Joes and more.<//text>

From sandwiches to wings to cheesecake to Mexican cuisine, there are a bunch of different food options if you are looking for a quick bite for lunch or a nice dinner with the family. There is also a 24 Hour fitness, an ArcLight Movie theater, and DSW. The Sherman Oaks Galleria is a one stop shop that will cover many of your needs.< /text>

It is a unique modernistic outdoor mall. I just wish there were cheaper dining options and more shops instead of just offices and condos.<//Review>

Not great for shopping. This place is more for private business, few places to eat, quick and sit down restraunts. Jersey Mike's, Philadelphia Cheesestack with provolone cheese pretty good.</Review>

Sucks!! Changed so much!!! Back in the 80s the Sherman Oaks Galleria was the center of fashion and teen culture!! It was the center to all that was Valley Girls, from fashion, lingo and even music (Valley Girl). Today’s teen talk was based on Valley Girl lingo! Dead is the cultural icon known as the Sherman Oaks Galleria!!<//Review>

Not great for shopping. This place is more for private business, few places to eat, quick and sit down restraunts. Jersey Mike's, Philadelphia Cheesestack with provolone cheese pretty good.</Review>

It is a unique modernistic outdoor mall. I just wish there were cheaper dining options and more shops instead of just offices and condos.</Text>

<review>Do not take any valuables into the gym, my locker as well as for other blockers were broken into. What's funny I think the employees there open the lock when someone said there lock didn't open, and didn't register the person's name. That's what I was told by a person who I ran into later on a week later who was present at the time my locker was broken into. This locker Room is unsafe, no security whatsoever to protect your personal belongings, I lost over $400 .

Again this 24 hour fitness is not a safe place to store anything, even in your clothing. All someone has to do is tell the employee they can't get into their locker, an employee will break the lock and not log the name or verify the locker belongs to the person they are opening the locker for.<//review><username>Curtis Winston<//username>< Time>

Definitely the best location just on the 405 and the 101 is not a better location than this place !!! Unfortunately the parking doesn't manage right and they have valet in the parking lot . Other than this everything is great ! Please note this place almost have no stores so don't go there for shopping this place is mainly to see movies and restaurants</review>

The Sherman Oaks Galleria has so much to offer!  It’s a one stop shopping, dinner, events and movies. One of the newest places there is L.A.’s newest children’s indoor playground & party space located inside the Sherman oaks galleria.  Arclight Cinemas is more than a place to see a movie; it is an experience! Before the movie go to the Arclight Cafe and they have a full menu of both food and cocktails. It also has a 24 Hour Fitness, Cheesecake Factory restaurant and DSW- Designer Shoe Warehouse!  During the holidays they have fun events for the kids too!</Review>

Not a typical mall with all your chain stores, but certainly lovely if you're just looking for a movie and some grub. ... Or home goods, a gym, waxing or a beauty school. A quite random, glorified strip mall.</Review>

Nice place, clean. Parking structure smells like pukes though, and I wish valet would open earlier. Nice staff too.</Text>

Validated parking is good. Also convenient place for a gym. However, not much else besides the arclight and a few restaurants.< /Text>

It's pretty, but there aren't too many shops and the places you actually want to get to are far way from the parking garage. That being said, the places they do have (ArcLight, Cheesecake Factory, P.F. Chang's) are all good. I'm sad El Torito is no longer there; it's absence is definitely felt.< /text>

Sherman Oaks Galleria was the mall that made "Valley Girls" famous back in the 80's. Since then it has been redesigned as an outdoor mall that features ArcLight theatres, The Cheesecake Factory, and 24-Hour Fitness.

The parking is a little challenging here but they do offer valet parking as an alternative. If you are willing to pay more for parking,  you can avoid the hassle of parking your car.

Most of the restaurants and ArcLight theatres validate for regular parking for the first 2 hours.<//Review>

I go there for the Arclight Cinema and Happy Hours in the restaurants downstairs if there's time before the movie, plus there's 4 hour parking validation. As long as you avoid traffic hour it's pretty easy to get there, but since it sits at the intersections of Ventura Blvd & Sepulvida Blvd and Ventura and San Diego freeways, you never know so check traffic or Google Maps before you go.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Aside from the Arclight theater, you have 3 or 4 dining options and a 24 hour fitness. Very nice mall but not one that you go to for window shopping.<//text><rate>3</rate><GmapID>0x80c29794c8097071:0x83eca8ad4cef2f0< /GmapID><Time>1482555924496</Time></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Saw it off the freeway and thought it was a mall. Stopped by and quickly discovered it was not. Left within 5 minutes of entering, and was charged parking despite explaining the mixup to the attendant. Don't waste your time, this place is a joke.< /Review><rate>1< /rate><userid>110515145891968890651</userid><resp>None< /resp></record>

<review>Went to meet friends at Cheesecake Factory for lunch. When I went to pay for my validated parking it was $14. I called the assistance button and Maria told me to cancel it and tell her what the validation code was. When I told her it was Cheesecake Factory she said ok put it back in. When I did it was $16 and she told me if I kept talking it would just go up. When I talked to her supervisor he said just to pay it and leave. Seriously? I don't even pay that for high interest parking. What in the world is the galleria doing charging those rates. They told me it was because they charge the corporate businesses that amount so they have to charge the shoppers that too.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Arrows leading to handicap parking at valet entrance are non-existent. Slim store selection. If you just want something to eat or to see a movie (a very expensive movie), this is the place to visit. The old newsstand is long gone, as are all the little n8che stores. You can, however, eat at Freshland, PF Chang's, Japanese fast food, erc.<//Text>

<review>I always tell my wife that this is a sad excuse for a mall.  The only places that make this worth going to are Cheesecake Factory and Arclight Theaters.  And while waiting for a table at Cheesecake, we wander to DSW.  When we have the $$$, we also go to Burke Williams, but that is special occasion only.  There's a gym there, so that always makes parking "interesting" too.  All in all, it's ok.  I go there, but for only for specific reason.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

A great place to meet with friends and relatives. If you play Pokémon go, has more than a few pokestops. Is always a safe place when the sun goes down</text>

Nothing too great here.  Food places are all decent,  Arclight is on the lower end of the scale as far as Arclight's go. Everything is pricey because of its location.</Review>

Really hard to say in general about the shopping mall as we went just to the ArcLight theater we really enjoyed the ArcLight there it's a nice theater and as far as the mall looks like a nice outdoor mall but most of the shops were closed< /text>

The Galleria in Sherman Oaks has a movie theather,  24 hour gym, big box retailers, and multiple dining options.

Dining options are highlighted by a Cheesecake Factory, PF Chang's, Buffalo Wildwings, and Starbucks. The restaurants are good and consistent with their other locations.

Big box retailers include DSW, Urban Home. The theather is an Archlight and is not normally too busy. The theather has reserved seating and is a good place to see a movie as there are not many theather options in Sherman Oaks.

The reason why 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because of the parking. It is located at the far end of the Galleria and is not free.<//Text>

From the top of the parking lot off of Sepulveda Ave., you can see for miles and watch airliners land and launch from nearby Burbank Airport, and even attend collage at DeVry University just off the food court near Starbuck's.  Drive from here either direction on Ventura Ave or continue south on Sepulveda for a wide selection of restaurants, bars, and businesses along one of the longest city streets in Los Angeles.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<text>I only go to this outdoor mall for very specific reasons e.g. seeing a movie at Arclight, going to Cheesecake Factory, etc. There are not enough shops here to just go walking around to shop, and the large parking structure with many levels and paid ticket parking makes the barrier to entry that much higher.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

It still reminds me of working at the theaters when they were filming Valley Girl and Terminator, so it'll always hold a special 'hang out' spot in my heart...but what they've done to it now, (making it an outdoor mall),...I'd rather drive to fashion square (which is now an indoor mall)<//review>

This is a fairly small location, with some good restaurants and offerings, but very scant offerings in terms of clothing, electronics, or toys.

The location is very good, right at the intersection of the 405, Sepulveda Blvd, and Ventura Blvd, and the mall manages to make what is objectively a very small space felt bigger. Still, the lack of space means there are no department or big box stores whatsoever. Instead, I would recommend either the Westfield which is off of Riverside and Hazeltine or the Northridge Fashion Center which is farther at Tampa Ave and Nordhoff Street but has a great selection.

Be sure to check if the stores you visit offer parking validation, as parking is not free at the Galleria.<//review>

Sure this place is fancy, but all I do here is work out at 24. Unfortunately they only validate parking for 2 lousy hours. After sprinting to my car Im literaly a minute early and the parking attendant lady of course had a language barrier problem... and takes her sweet time walking out of her booth and taking my ticket. SOMEHOW I'm a minute late and decides to charge me. This crap happens all the time. All those dollars add up to precious yogurtland trips.</Review>

The main draw here is Arclight Sherman Oaks.  There's also a 24 Hour Fitness.  Lots of covered parking that mostly free- lots of tenants validate.< /Review>

Visited Arc Light theater, not the nicest theater I've been to. Seats do not recline, not enough leg room. For the price, not worth it.< /text>

Good movie theaters and restaurants available, though all are expensive and parking certainly can be too. Overall not too much entertainment to justify going.< /text>

< Review>
Awkwardly located on the corner of Ventura Blvd and Sepulveda Blvd and backed up to the 405, Sherman Oaks Galleria somehow survives.  As far as malls go, it's alright.  The Galleria is located just north of the 101 and 405 merge, and getting to it can painful, depending on time of travel.  Avoid mornings and evenings and it won't hurt as much.  Parking is awful.<//Review>

The entire mall is way too expensive to park at. I think they charge $4 to park at the mall. Is this a crazy town I've gone to? Is everyone insane but me?<//text>
