Average coffee, average pastries. Main perk is the late operating hours and plentiful seating. Also the bus stop right outside allows some piece of mind for those taking the bus home late. The establishment itself is fairly run-down feeling and the restroom doesn't radiate a sense of hygiene. Some of the outlets are very loose so woe to anyone who has a Mac or other heavy charger because it will not stay in. Select your table and chairs carefully, lots of wobblyness!</Review>

<review>Generally reliable, the staff has always been friendly and enjoyable. They accept the fact that it's near to campus and don't make you feel bad about camping out to work--and there are plenty of outlets to keep you in business (provided it's not around midterms or finals, when seating becomes scarce). The espesso isn't impressive, but it does the job.</review>< pics>

Just strolled in here through an open door. The woman behind the counter said something I couldn't hear over the construction noise. I came around to the counter so we wouldn't have to speak across the sneeze guard and she angrily threw her arms out repeatedly, shooing me away with a scowl on her face. She caught herself and put on a strained and facetious smile to say they were closed, but it was too late for me. Everyone is tired in the morning, especially people looking for coffee. Being straight up rude isn't a way to treat your customers. If you're closed, close your door, or put your shoddily handwritten sign somewhere it can be seen. Don't punish people for wanting to buy things from you. I work in the neighborhood but hadn't visited this place until today. Needless to say, I won't be coming back.<//Text>

The food, coffee, and service are all fine. It is often too crowded to find a place to sit and it is a bit dark for a work space.</Review>

Sort of a typical non-Starbuck's coffee house. A selection of baked treats, coffees, and juice. Service was quick although communication between the cashier and the person preparing the order could be better. I ordered iced coffee and got a hot cup. The lemon icing cake was nice. Many tables and seats but I am sure that during the fall and spring terms the place is alot more crowded being at a stop for a bus that goes to the campus.</review>

I like the vibe in here.  It seems to be less crowded in the evenings than Caffe Strada down the street.  WiFi still free.< /review>

Crowded and busy with college kids, the coffee isn't really that good and the did is overpriced. The wireless is quality, though and the location is great so I keep going.<//review>

<text>My cappuccino review: poor. I ordered a double capp and what I got was an explosion of foam. Seriously over half of the cup was foam, and it was more like styrofoam than what I would like to see of coffee. The person who made this cup of coffee steamed the milk into oblivion where all that was left was super stiff tasteless foam and slightly overcooked milk. Topping that off was the harshness of the coffee, it was either made from low cost beans or they just don't know how to pull a good espresso from their machine. Peet's provides a much better capp than this place.

I won't be trying their capp again or any espresso drinks, once burned is enough for me, though I will go back and try their normal coffee at some point.

Ambiance: good. A fair number of tables with wifi and power, it's nice enough that it earns a star just for the feel of support for folks who want to get something done. The environment wasn't too loud but over two thirds of the tables were used up at 1:30 or so. I've not tried the food stuff yet, but if I go back I'll expand my review.</text><gmapID>0x80857c32a49bd15f:0xc8f12a2bddb68bcc< /gmapID>< name>

If you go there enough times they will remember you and what you like and begin to suggest it when you come in. If there’s no fresh coffee by the benches they’ll pour you some fresh coffee right over the counter! Prices are fair< /Text>

The donuts are $3 a piece, and they are dry, probably because it's all vegan.  The also have flyers supporting terrorists, or at least for donations to people who are being charged under federal terrorism laws.  I guess you come here for the politics and not the food.< /Text>

Dr. Burt is very friendly and helpful. My mom was experiencing major pain in back, neck and shoulder. After 6 visits, she feels much better and the pain is not as bad as before. She will continue seeing Dr. Burt for better results. He’s also flexible with his schedule. Highly recommended!< /Review>

I've had middle back pain for a couple of years now, to the point that simply washing the dishes would become painful after only a few minutes. I didn't want to keep taking pain pills every day, so I finally looked into a chiropractor. I ended up finding Dr. Burt's practice, and I was very pleased to find out that he handles all the patient scheduling as well as all the work himself. After about 3 visits my back is no longer hurting when I'm bent over, I actually sleep better, and overall I just feel good. He's definitely the guy to see if you need a good chiropractor. He makes sure you're comfortable the entire time and I always leave feeling better than I came in!</text>

<Review>Dr Burt is amazing. He knows what he is doing. Last summer I had a serious back problem where I barely could get up and experienced an enormous pain while sitting.
Luckily for me Dr. Burt’s clinic was only 5 min walk for me. After two sessions I felt much better, 2 more sessions and pain disappeared.
Recently I had a similar issue. Went to a different clinic, after 5 sessions without any improvements I went back to Dr. Burt and guess what? No more back pain. Highly recommend him.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<review>Dr. Burt has a gift. He listened to my concerns about my health and is helping me to reverse the damage caused by years of repetitive motion and poor body posture do to my previous career. I would refer anyone in need of a great chiropractor to Dr. Burt. I believe that many of his patients drive a distance to receive his care.</review><gmap_id>0x808f902d50bfe593:0x30eaa2a8ad74d22e<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I came to Dr Burt for chiropractic care after my car accident, and he was welcoming and considerate to my conditions. His scheduling made it efficient for me to also go to school and work without issue. As it was my first time being adjusted for my neck and back, Dr. Burt made it less frightening and more comfortable. The treatment was great and helped lessen the pain I had from my injury. Overall, great treatment, would recommend if it is your first time seeing a chiropractor.</Review>

Dr. Burt is such an amazing chiropractor and very down to earth. He identified my back problem and knew how to fix it immediately. He has very flexible hours that worked with my job and always kept me up to date on my treatment. Dr. Burt is professional and timely with his treatments. Anyone looking for a chiropractor I would definitely recommend him!<//review>

I fell injuring my back and needed to see a doctor to alleviate the intense pain. I could not take a deep breath then I found Dr. Burt on google and he has been able to help the pinched nerve and I am forever grateful. Thank Dr. Burt! I will recommend your services to whom ever needs you.</Review>

<text>I'm a male in my 50's who has spent effort to consistently staying fit through weight training and & other athletic pursuits on a regular basis. Of course,  at this age, it's resulted in some significant wear & tear on my body. I'd sublimated that fact enough to the point that I'd been living with quite a bit of chronic pain due to a whole variety of bone/muscle imbalances.
So as cliché as it might sound, my experience here has been fairly dramatic, even life-changing. Getting adjusted here has me looking forward to each next day and being able to stay fit and healthy. Without reservation, I highly recommend Dr. Burt.</text>< Pictures>

<date>1499455482339<//date><Text>Burt Chiropractic is the best place to go for help. I was involved in an accident and was informed it would be a long process to heal a back injury. Even though it took some time, Dr. Burt himself makes you feel like part of the family immediately, while working his magic to help heal and his staff makes you feel more than welcomed! Gail the masseuse works wonders, and don't worry, when Dr. Burt is away, you are left in just as good of hands as if he were there. The facilities are clean, cozy and comfortable. I am so glad I was referred to him, best decision.<//Text>< Name>

Burt Chiropractic has been awesome!  This was my first time receiving chiropractic care and Dr. Burt made me feel comfortable and confident in his abilities.  He is always friendly, polite, and a great practitioner.  His massage therapist, Gale, is also an expert therapist and wonderful to work with.  They were the perfect team to facilitate my recovery from a recent injury.  He runs a very efficient office with convenient hours, flexible appointments, and minimal wait times.  I couldn’t be happier!< /Review>

Be careful with this doctor. He worked with Accident  Attorney's  Group  Inc. They solicited my case then when the case got dropped.  Nobody gets anything.  Without prior billing or notice to me. Puts me on collection and ruin my credit .

I didn't  pick to go to your affiliate clinic. You chose to  work with this attorneys and when you don't get your money. You took it on me. I have 2 heath insurance. Sutter health and Kaiser. I have good medical coverage. I did not have to go thru you if not the attorney you work with.</text>

Good, straight-forward care. I’d never been to a chiropractor until I got into an auto accident. The idea was a bit daunting, but Dr. Burt made it easy. His demeanor inspires confidence and thus far my recovery is moving along. Would recommend.</text>

Had the best experience here! I can with a totally stiff neck and Dr Burt did a very thorough examination and after one treatment I was feeling much better. As an athlete, it's important to find a doctor who understands injuries as well as maintenance to be in top form. I will continue to come for regular care and upkeep. I love that this office has flexible and late hours, perfect for someone who needs to go after work.</Text>

From the beginning, Dr.Burt was very warm and personable as he described our spinal issues and the necessary treatment required in plain terminology for us to understand. We were not disappointed by our visits and in the future we will be sure to return, as he definitely lives up to his reviews.< /Review>< pictures>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I just want to start off by saying that Dr.Burt Is by far the best chiropractor.

I was involved in a bad auto accident, since  I have had horrible back and rib pain.

Upon the first visit, Dr. Burt was able to identify the area of pain. He was very straightforward and honest in regards to my treatment.

I have followed his instructions and continue to visit him 3x a week.  He is doing a marvelous job, though I am not back to 100% just yet. Largely because the impact of the auto accident was severe, something else he told me would take time to recover.

However, I have no doubt that I will be fully recovered within the next couple of months. Especially because Dr. Burt puts his patience first and is a master of his practice.

I highly recommend Dr.Burt to anyone who is dealing with any sort of pain. I definitely know that upon the completion of my therapy I will be returning for regular adjustments.!!

THANK YOU DR. BURT 💪🏽</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>In late August I came in to see Dr. Burt. During this time I had been using crutches because I could not walk. Right away Dr. Burt was already telling me things wrong with me that other doctors had not even discussed with me. For example I had no idea my whole back was miss aligned by a couple inches. Dr. Burt than told that my condition was severe but that there is still hope and that was something I need to hear. At first I was seeing him 3 times a week, each week slowly getting better and better which sounds like slow progress but it was the most I had seen in months because my condition was worsening before I came in. And as of October 23 I've been able to walk more than I have been able to walk in the last 6 months.  I am still visiting Dr. Burt but now only once a week as I have improved significantly since the first day.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><rating>5</rating>< Date>

I wish i had found Dr Burt sooner! I've suffered from vertigo for over 4years, Dr's all said it was an inner ear issue and nothing could be done other than anti nausea medicine. My latest episode lasted 3 weeks before I finally tried chiropractic help. Dr Burt did an evaluation and told me what was going on. Not an inner ear problem but a neck problem. As well as lower back pain. He did a few adjustments, was patient and kind. After 24 hours the vertigo was almost completely gone. After 2 more sessions I was much better. I will go back for regular adjustments.<//text>

I called and left messages with several chiropractors and Dr.Burt was the first to respond in a timely manner. His office is clean and professional, while he is knowledgeable and skilled, giving me a great adjustment (as well as a professional massage from Gail, his massage therapist) for an affordable cost. As a health professional who works in a stressful hospital environment among psychiatric patients, Dr. Burt's healing hands(& Gail's) are a necessary and welcome path to wellness.

<Text>At least 6 months i've experienced an exhausting shoulder-neck pain, tennis and golf elbow issues, that completely knocked  me out from the tennis court. In a seconds, Dr. Burt evaluated my condition, and performed a manual spine adjustment right away.
After following 6 sessions of the manual spine adjustment with a combination of a cold laser therapy, heat and massage, my health condition has drastically improved. I still follow his wise post-treatment recommendations, and i feel like pretty soon i will be back playing tennis again.

<text>I had a wonderful experience with both Dr. Burt and Gail. Dr. Burt was very friendly, helpful and flexible. He really worked with my busy schedule and allowed me to come at different times according to my baby's nap schedule.  He definitely helped me to have a more straight spine with his adjustments. Gail's deep tissue massage really helped my tight strained muscles. The combination of both of them working together really helped me on my road to recovery from the car accident.<//text>< Pictures>

Some things I appreciated about my experience:
1. If you don't get him on the 'phone right away he calls you back, in person, very quickly.
2. A couple of hours after the treatment he emailed to see how I was doing.
3. I found him to be both knowledgeable and kind - what a great combo!

Sincere thanks for the great service.</Review>< Date>

I've been having lower back problems for the last 18 years or so. I also had a lot of different chiropractors (or wanna be a chiropractor) worked on my back, some better then the others, some are big, and some are small (and considering that I am 6.4 / 210 - size does matter if you want to crack my frame). Lately I've been in a lot of pain, and after multiple cortisone injections, and "other" chiropractors - seem to be no help. But then I found Dr. Burt, and since the very first visit I knew I was in good hands. Very quick and straight to the point diagnosis, and suggested treatment. We worked on progressive steps in my treatment, and it seems to be helping. I would highly recommend Dr. Burt to all who needs chiropractic care. And one main thing people: start early! Don't wait until your minor back issue becomes a chronic life altering situation. Adjust it early! Go see Dr. Burt.</Text>

<text>I first started seeing Dr. Burt more than a year now; and I've been very happy with his professionalism and work.  He is very thorough and friendly.  His diagnosis and treatment are well explained.  Most importantly, he listens to your problems or ache and attends it.

My line of work makes back hurt very frequently and every time i get adjusted, I feel really good....

Another reason why I enjoy going to this place; in fact, that I get to be seen in a very short notice.  I walked in so many times, without any appointment,  and I was NEVER turned down.

If you are looking for a GREAT Chiropractor,  THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO!!!<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1395076096763, 'text': 'I will make sure that you can get a medal on your next MTB race. Keep your spine aligned Doc.'}<//resp>< GmapID>

I was in a lot of pain due to a sports related accident. It was also on a Saturday where most chiropractors were not available. Although Dr. Burt was not available on Saturdays, he was still able to squeeze me in for treatment. Dr. Burt listened patiently about my situation and then proceeded with the treatment. Barely half an hour, I was walking out of his clinic feeling relieved. After 2 days I followed it up with another treatment and my lower back pain is completely gone. I will recommend him to all my friends. Thanks so much Ed! You're awesome!<//Review>

I've been seeing Dr. Burt for over two months and he is amazing. His technique, service and methods of up to date technology surpass other chiropractors I've seen in the past by far! Oh and did I mention Gail his on site massage therapist who gives you the best massages after each therapy session. I can't say enough.

<Text>I was recently involved in a car accident, pretty bad one i might add.
When the accident happened i was shocked i didn't knot what needed to be done, all i knew is that i was hurting and  i needed help.
Dr. Burt has been the best help we could get, not only with our weekly therapy but also advising us every step of the way.
I am still taking therapy but my back injure does feel much better.
Also needles to say the environment here so friendly, from Dr Burt who always answers any questions i have, and of course adjust my back every time  and it feel great.
To Gayle, who provides excellent massage therapy as well.
Bottom line if you need any help come see Dr. Burt you wont be disappointed.< /Text><UserId.>114397166854807039664< /UserId.>< Gmap_id>

When I called Dr Burt explaining I was in extreme pain, he got me in with in a couple hrs. The work he did on me was amazing. When done, I had already felt 75% better. Within a few hours of leaving his office I was amazed how the pain decreased substantially and I felt much better head to toe.
Dr Burt is very professional and obviously knows what he is doing but at the same time is especially personable. He explained clearly what he was going to do, giving me a sense of understanding and trust.
I highly recommend Dr Burt.< /text>

In seeking a professional and honest chiropractor, someone who can provide me with a proper treatment plan to help address my tension headaches and get to the root of the problem, my friend recommended I give Dr. Burt a call. His exceptional technique and care has significantly reduced my pain just after several visits. Dr. Burt also worked with me to provide additional instruction and suggestions on what I can do on my own to further expedite my healing. Anyone seeking someone to work on your TMJ, he is your guy.
He is easy to reach and if unavailable, quick to respond to my phone calls, making for easy scheduling.

I am glad I’ve found someone like Dr. Burt to provide me with chiropractic care to keep my body in a pain-free and top working state.< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I am not one to typically write reviews, but I had to write a review for Dr. Burt! I am really amazed at how great I feel is so little time. I had an injury from 4 years ago that had not been treated adequately by other chiropractors. To be frank, I had given up on the idea go going to see a chiropractor for my back pain, but I decided to try it a third time since I was in so much pain. I am glad I went to see Dr. Burt! He truly is skillful and knowledgable in his practice. He goes straight to the point and honest and does not waste your time. Most importantly he is very approachable and personable. If you are thinking of giving any chiropractor a try, I would highly suggest you stop looking and visit Dr. Burt =]< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I was recommended by a friend to this chiropractic of Dr. Burt after I and my brother were involved in an accident to have our pains and injuries checked out. At first, it was a getting to know process and how we sustained those types of injuries which Dr. Burt precisely explained, and cleared up some dilemma's in our head. He's been practicing this for certain amount of years and his expertise in helping his patients get back on track is astounding. The facility is maintained to the highest standard, and his staff is as down to earth and professional as he is. We always look forward to our session and anticipate that we will have great experience, and he never disappointed us. I can proudly say that with Dr. Burt's help, I'm back to where I was before, lively, active, and passionate again to things that I love doing in my everyday life. I believe that I still got it when I start lifting those weights again after months of healing and recovering, and undeniably awesome experience we had in Dr. Burt's Chiropractic Clinic.<//text>

<Review>I was rear ended by a big rig, where the driver actually hit me 3 times. This left me in a lot of pain to the point where I could barely even walk or drive. Luckily, I found Dr. Burt's office. He was able to take me the same day I gave him a call. I have been going to his office for 3 months. Dr. Burt does the alignments and Gail gives a massage after. Both are great and I highly recommend coming here because they really do their best to make sure you leave in better shape than when you came in. Worth every penny. Thank you Dr. Burt & Gail for helping with my recovery!!</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Highly recommended!  I've been having on and off back pain for over a year and have been seeing different chiropractors.  I had a severe back pain few weeks ago which I can barely walk.   I decided to go with Dr. Burt due to the good reviews and I feel much better afterward.  I definitely will go there again to keep my spine in good health.< /Review>< Pics>

I would recommend Dr. Burt for anyone in the San Leandro, CA area... He provides great chiropractic and health education to his patients. His social media is very informative and is top notch.

My experience with Dr. Burt was always accommodating.  He was always able to see me and always very pleasant.  He helped me when I was in tremendous pain and made suggestions while in recovery.  I am lucky that I was referred to him. A family member recommended him because I was getting the run around with other chiropractors and attorneys.  He set me on the right track!<//review>

<Review>I will keep this short and sweet ( just like my experience here) I got into a car accident a couple months ago and was reffered to Dr Burt by my Father. My back and neck was in so much pain and out of alignment. Dr Burt reassured me that I will be fine, sure enough he was right. I would see him twice a week and started feeling better even after the first session. Hes an amazing Dr and  definitely knows what he is doing. For anyone who has any sort of pain,  he is THE MAN to go to! Overall GREAT experience, and will continue to come here for overall regular adjustments.
I have  referred a few people here and they all loved it. BEST Chiropractor!!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< user_id>

I met Dr.Burt about a year ago Mt.Biking. He was a nice guy and we exchanged contact info. Did not see him but that one time riding. About a 6 weeks ago I gave him a call to see about some lower back and knee pain I was having. He had me stop in and checked my back and started treating me for the pain and discomfort I was having.After about 2 visits my knee began feeling better and since then I stop in about once every 2-3 weeks. Between Dr.Burt's adjustments and Gail's deep tissue work I have been feeling a lot better. Dr.Burt has followed up and discussed what can help keep my back in better shape. I recommend Dr.Burt to anyone who wants to get on the path to better health. Thanks Dr.Burt and staff for the great experience. Sincerely, JFoy<//Text>

Dr. Burt and Gayle most definitely live up to their stars at this practice. I have been going to Burt Chiropractic for about a month and a half now since a bad accident that totaled my car. I came in with a lot of back and neck pains and Dr. Burt along with Gayle's massages have helped ease my back to its normal self. Most definitely recommend!!< /Text>

I've been treating here for more than two months, and must say I feel better than before after my car accident. Dr. Burt is a good listener and can always squeeze you in for an appointment. After a couple of visits you feel like you have known him for a long time. If in or around San Leandro, and you are looking for a good quality chiropractor and flexibility in your schedule you must visit Dr. Burt.< /Text>

I went to Dr. Burt for dizziness problems after I tried almost everything else. He really understood what I needed. He did 12 sessions of neck and spine adjustment and during/after treatment, I was able to notice a great reduction in dizziness and an improved quality of life. He is a friendly, knowledgeable, practical and caring chiropractor. I can't say enough good things about him. Highly recommended.< /text>

Dr. Burt is an amazing healer and medical professional. I came to see him following a car accident in which I was rear-ended at high speed. I'd been dealing with pretty bad lower back pain for weeks prior to seeing him, but he was able to greatly reduce the pain within several sessions and was then able to completely improve my symptoms within a few months time.  I go back to him now and then to deal with other issues as they come up. Thanks Dr. Burt!<//review>

<Review>I started having some back pain and headaches and my doctor is more for natural health  so recommended that I go to a chiropractor. I didn't believe in chiropractors I thought that they were just a waste of time and money.  Since I went I haven't had headaches in four weeks and my back pain is completely gone now. He explained some anatomies about how this works which I didn't completely understand, but it works so I thought I'm very impressed I leave a review.  Now I am a believer.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Date>

Dr. Burt is hands on and takes his time to listen and chat with his patients. That way, as a patient one feels really understood and the treatment is flexible and well explained. I highly recommend Dr. Burt if you want a doctor who cares about you and a place where you are comfortable and come out better than when you went in.< /Review>

I went to several different chiropractors over the last few years due to a chronic low back injury and I have not had any relief. I have seen Dr. Burt on two seperate occasions and each time he has performed miracles on my back. I now have no lower back pain. I highly recommend coming here if you want honest opinions and the best choropractic care.<//Text>

<Review>When you search for the best chiropractor in town you get what you ask for. My husband and I have both sustained injuries of our own and after years of pushing though the pain/trying alternative treatments we found Dr. Burt.
Dr. Burt and his team are amazing; the collaboration of a chiropractor and massage therapist is brilliant. I noticed immediate results after one visit and so did my husband who has a herniated disk & compressed L5.
Thank you Dr. Burt & Gail</Review>< pics>

I was referred to Dr. Burt for chiropractic care. Dr. Burt is quite personable over the phone and assured me that I would be well taken care of (his staff has been chosen well for their crafts). My treatments have gone quite well and my pain level has improved over 90%.I am recommending Dr. Burt for any chiropractic care.             (Go Dr. Burt) !!!< /Review>

able to remain upright for longer than one hour. I was in a lot of pain.
I received my evaluation and adjustment. Later, I received muscle
stimulation, heat treatment and massage. I started to believe that I
will be fine.

Dr. Burt was extremely attentive to my progress, always answering my
questions and even relax my anxiety with his calm, unshakeable
assurance in my well-being.

He gave me exercises and stretches that I did at home, was also very
responsive, and helped me recover quicker.

Dr. Burt improved my posture - which was the cause of my knee problems
and he did a lot more to return myself back to normal life: gave me confidence in my
tomorrow.

As I know now, with my knee problems, if you go to any doctor (even
orthopedic!) - the usual choice you can have is to wear knee immobilizer for
couple of month (or more!) and physical therapy (or some aggressive treatments
which I always refused). It will likely not relieve your problems.
What really does the trick is working on it with your chiropractor who
will improve not only your local problems but your overall health and posture.

And the best of chiropractor I know is Dr.Burt!!

Dr. Burt is most educated, intelligent and progressive doctor i know - who
uses new technologies and educates his patients by posting on the
Burt Chiropractic Weekly Newsletter.
He advocated sport and natural style of living and is a serious sportsmen
himself (bicycling).

If you are looking to get out of pain and to optimize your health, then call
Burt Chiropractic today!<//Review><rate>5< /rate></record>

<review>What can be said of Dr. Burt that hasn’t already been stated? As a rehab professional with a very physical job (occupational therapist), I can’t stress enough how much my time with Dr. Burt has allowed me to continue working. Dr. Burt is able to hone in on what’s hurting you and manage that in a very skilled way. In the 3 months of my time spent with Dr. Burt following being rear-ended by a big rig, I went from being in pain every single minute to now only every few days. Gale (who provides massages) and Lally (Dr. Burt’s assistant) are wonderful women who have made me feel like family. With Dr. Burt’s adjustments and Gale’s expertise massage techniques, I have learned what it’s like to enjoy my work again. Yes, I still have pain. There are no miracle fixes. But my quality of life has vastly improved. Thanks Dr. Burt, Lally, and Gale!<//review>< GmapID>

<Review>Dr. Burt is very professional and listens to his patient's needs.He is very accommodating and can adjust treatment according to patient's chiropractic needs. His Physical Therapist Gail is also very caring and knows what to do to relieve pain from injury. Both has excellent customer service and very knowledgeable in their craft. I would highly recommend their 5 star service.< /Review><user_name>francis reyes</user_name><user_id>106984647963473295709< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I am very pleased with the results after my two visits with Dr Burt. As a 67 year old who is very active in sports ( tennis and golf) my back and pelvis need adjustments every now and then. My regular chiropractor moved to New York and I was looking for someone to take her place.

Without his care I would not be enjoying the active lifestyle I love. I recommend him highly.

I was Recommended to Burt Chiropractic by my friend after I have been having a niggling pain and stiffness in my upper back. Nothing serious but very annoying and nagging. He took a look at me and I had my first adjustment! It feels like nowadays instant relief is hard to come by but I found it at Burt Chripractic! He was very nice and helped me understand what I was feeling and why. He was an Absolute Champion!<//Text>

It was a great experience. Dr. Burt knew exactly what he was doing and fixed me up without any issues. I had back pain for a few weeks and he found the problems that caused it and corrected the. I would recommend his services to anyone who is in pain.< /Review>

When I first came to Dr. Burt I couldn't even stand up straight and I had lot of pain in my back .
After being treated by Dr.Burt just couple of times not only my pain was gone I also was able to stand up straight and walk .
So I highly recommend Dr. Burt.
Thank you so much for helping me to able to stand up straight Dr.Burt< /Text>

<Text>I was in a car accident and decided to come here based on the Yelp reviews. Its pretty good, dr. Burt is very nice and so is the massage therapist Gail and their assistant. They're easy to talk to and humorous. I look forward to coming here because I know I feel better afterwards, especially if I've worked out the day before coming here. I've definitely been feeling better, dr. Burt knows what he's doing!< /Text>< Pics>

I was in a really bad car accident 4yrs before I went to see Dr.Burt and the pain in my back was extremely bad. After 12 session with him my back felt better than it had in years. The sessions were a reasonable amount of time and price. Everyone there is also very kind.<//Review>

<Review>I'm so gracious  I found Dr. Burts office, I had horrible back lower pain that started to shoot down my legs it was bothering me to work, walk and sleep ! There was times were I couldn't get up from bed I seriously needed someone to come help me up I also had trouble getting dressed and showering. I visited the emergency room a couple times and all they gave me was medicine that didn't work. Finally I found him on google and called to make an appointment he took me in that same week. From the first visit i noticed a huge change on my back i was able to work normally and finally get some sleep. I have had 3 visits and in those three visits I went from not being able to get up by myself in the mornings to working out again and going back to my regular activities. I forgot to mention that Iam really active and due to my back lower pain i was starting to feel depressed!! Dr. Burt has helped me get my life back in three sessions! I appreciate his professionalism and quality service!!<//Review>< pictures>

< review>
After countless epidurals, injections and medications for my neck and back pain, I had been on a 2 year long rollercoaster.  After being referred to Dr Burt by my acupuncturist, I really felt like this was my last hope to help with my chronic pain.  Never going to a chiropractor before I was a little leery (or more like scared lol) how much this would help me.  But after my first appointment the fear was gone and so was a little of the pain.  Finally someone understood the pain that I was in and wanted to truly help me be pain free.  Not just give me pills to mask the pain..  With my pain making it difficult to walk I started a series of appointments with Dr Burt and started seeing positive results.  After a few visits my body started feeling better.  Other symptoms that I has been triggered by my condition started going away.   The amounts of visits started to lessen since I was feeling good or less pain for longer periods of time.  I appreciated his flexible schedule and his honest an upfront approach to my care.  I have referred others patients to Dr Burt who have also benefitted from his techniques to manage/relieve their pain.  Thanks Dr Burt!</review>

<Review>I had gotten into a car accident and was suffering from back pain to the point where it was difficult to sleep. I had decided to see a chiropractor as soon as possible and had found Dr. Burt on Yelp. He got back to me immediately and was able to see me early the following day. Soon after seeing him my pain started subsiding and now my back is much much better.< /Review>< rate>

I am experiencing disc de-generation resulting from an auto accident that left me with bone graphs and a titanium plate attached to my spinal cord.  Consequentially, the pain immobilizes me at times, and I was walking around everyday with mild to severe neck and back pain.  I made the decision to see a chiropractor to help with my pain management.  After two visits with Dr. Burt and two aggressive adjustments to my neck and back, my pain was gone.  Thank you!  I highly recommend him!</review>

I was looking for a very long time, since my chiropractor retaired, to find a good one who can do ajastments and finaly I found Dr. Burt trough my husband's cousine. He is very knowledgeble and patient while answering all my questions in a proffesional manner.<//Review>

Love this hidden gem. Our go-to car wash. Actually met the owner on sunday morning couple months back while rushing to wash my car before church, he gave me some tokens, thanking me as a customer. I was so surprised and grateful. SUPER recommended, if you wanna save money, scared of those automated car-washing machine scratching ur car and be super detailed in washing/taking care of your car.<//Review>

Timer is not enough to wash a car, equipment is faulty and not maintained. Vacuums have holes or wrapped in tape and not working properly. Very outdated place and I am surprised its been there for years and not updated. Found another place that is more worth it and not coming here again. This was my car wash for 5 years, and maybe used it once a month (I have an old truck).</review>

Out of date equipment. Coin machine is always taking money and there’s no way to get it back unless the owner just happen to be there. Things are always out of order. This car wash has given me one too many headaches. Extremely disappointed.<//Review>

Everything works but there's almost no soap the vacuum was weak the wash bays were nasty and I'm pretty sure what they call "final rinse" is really just tap water. Also I don't like when they force you to use tokens. I always end up keeping and then losing one and then I paid that much extra</text>

<Review>Great wash but the bays are like a doubled up where you're in the same bay with another car washing with out a wall between you. I had to take a star off because the vacuum was absolutely worthless. I end up just shaking out everything that I could by hand.</Review>< pics>

Don't go here! For starters, when you exchange your money they give you TOKENS with no dollar value, instead of dollar coins like most car washes. RINSE and WAX was EMPTY. VACUUM DOESN'T WORK. Which is annoying because that is the main thing I wanted to use. I called the number twice - no answer. Left a message and haven't heard back. Now I'm left with valueless tokens and my car still dirty. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.< /Text>

Token machine out of service, people parked in the only open lane just chit chatting (not washing their car) while the other lane is coned off. A dog with its leash tied to a pole. Is this place even operable? Or should it be marked permanently closed?</text>

Nice inexpensive self service car wash. Not in the best area but it’s safe through the day. I’ve been here several times. My last visit the owner was there and gave me a free wash. Told me to see him next time I come in and he would give me another free wash.<//review>

This place is a TRAP, don't go here! It's in a terrible area. It is a terrible coin wash. You have to pay $3 minimum to start the meter. You can't use anything but TOKENS, so it actually costs $5 unless you have exactly 3 bills.. it's a total trap! There's pretty much only soap and water, and no filtered water either.. so, you're getting squeezed hard for your money, and you leave with dirty wheels, water spots and an empty pocket, if you leave at all, because this area is sketchy. Beware!</review>

They have a wheel  washing brush. Still uses quarters so you don't get stuck with washing coins in your change pocket. Those are worthless any where else.<//Text>

Does not take quarters takes tokens, has the worse bill reader I have ever dealt with in 20 years (I had crisp new bills from the bank even). And to top it off machine ate my token. Utter crap show, you should pass.</text>

I tried three vacuums no joke none of them worked. They just sit there collecting coins, I feel like this place is a scam and it should have big closed signs or something along the lines of "property condemned" the car wash is the worst I've ever seen no exaggeration. The owner of this dump should be ashamed and embarrassed to own this monstrosity.</Review>

It's only $2 for a wash and the vacs are $1. Armorall and Blue Sham towels are vended at discount prices. I actually like the layout because it is "easy in and out".

Avoid this self serve wash. Foot traffic walks through the wash areas, two cars share the same bay, and the site offered no spray wax or spot free rinse. I had to wash it again somewhere else an hour later to get rid of all the water spots to avoid them setting in. Hands down the worst self-serve wash place I've ever visited! One star was extremely generous.< /review>

I found this self service car wash online. I needed somewhere where I could wash my big truck because the standard car washes just don't do it right. This place had the right price too, especially for a guy like me with a big car. They have all the high pressure hoses and materials i need to get the job done after a dirty week of work. thanks ez coin!< /review>

Hard to notice as your driving by and it's not the best setup for a do it yourself car wash but it works since it's only one in that area. The main reason for the 2 stars rating is because you can't use quarters here, instead you have to buy tokens which are equal in value to a 1 dollar bill. The part that sucks is if you have a ton of quarters like I did you still can't use them because the change machine doesn't except anything else than dollar bills. If you can find another car cash over this one I would go to that one instead.</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I like to come and wash my car, it has accessories for drying, the brushes to carve the car are fine, I notice it scratches the car. The only thing that the manager of the car wash needs is a little pending, there is a demand to wash and there are those who wash it and do not move, or if they arrive and do not wash they are parked where it is needed

(Original)
Me gusta venir a lavar mi carro  tiene accesorios para secado los cepillos para tallar el auto están bien, note ralla el auto. Lo único que hace falta el encargado de el car wash este un poco pendiente hay demanda para lavar y hay quienes lo lavan y no s e mueven, o si llegan y no lavan están estacionados donde se necesita</text>< resp>

Generally, I prefer to pay more but for the car to be washed thoroughly by car wash employees. Self-service car washes are not my story.

Stacja na żetony. Osobiście tego nie lubię. Generalnie wolę zapłacić więcej ale, żeby samochód byl umyty dokładnie przez pracowników myjni. Myjnie samoobsługowe to nie moja bajka.<//Text>< Pics>

Hands down our favorite Thai restaurant! Everything we've ever ordered is incredibly delicious.  The Beef Panang Curry has the most delicious sauce you just want to drink right from the container.  The Chicken Cashew Nut is light and flavorful and perfect with fried rice.  We also love both the Pad Thai and Rad Na Noodles.  Try it once and you'll see. Bring an appetite!< /Text>

Maybe the best pad Thai in la? I’m impressed. I asked for it spicy and the lunch special comes with a delicious dumpling and soup or salad. I may update when I have the coconut soup but honestly I wish I would have known about this place sooner. Home run!< /Text>

Most of the dishes are good and the service is very friendly. If you are used to restaurants in Hollywood or other areas with more Thai presence, this is not at that level, but it’s a good Thai place for the West Valley and the staff and owner are great people.</Review>

<Review>I ordered green curry and as usual, I ate the whole thing myself...ugh. Why is curry so addictive? But it is. And delicious. I ordered takeout but I would also eat in. The ambiance is very nice. I like this as my little local spot with great food.<//Review>< user>

<review>Local Thai Restaurant close to home...
Ordered 2 take-out and dined in twice...
Service is amazing, staff is friendly.
Food is good. Can't wait to try some more in the future.
Highly recommend the tom yum seafood or chicken...<//review>< pictures>

They're a small, cozy Thai restaurant in my neighborhood.  Service is always friendly and efficient.  I think it's a family run business.  The food is always fresh and tasty.  Chicken or beef with basil and pad keep mow noodle with chicken are my favorites.  They do a busy take out business, but even so my order is always ready within 20 minutes or so, even on a weekend night.  I also suggest eating there for a delicious, quiet dinner.<//text>

I eat in this spot a lot since I work in the area. I got to say the customer service is always great and they keep the spot well kept at all times. Pricing is fair and they serve big portions.<//text>

Might be the best and most consistent place to get Thai food. Flavors are amazing. Love the dynamite wings, pork jerky, red curry, pad se u, Siam shrimp, and the wonton soup.< /Text>

Best Thai food in the valley! The menu has tons to pick from, I have never picked something and not loved it. I live within a few blocks and get dinner here often.  The owner is just the sweetest person. I am so glad there is such a great and healthful place to eat so close to home!   Try it, you’ll love it!!!<//Text>

One of the standouts in the valley as small restaurants go. Cha Cha is the best to be served by and the food is of high quality and delicious. Go and you'll be both pleased and pleasantly surprised at the caliber of product.< /Text>

The price and portions at this place are great. I usually will get a Rad Na Noodles Wide rice noodles, mushrooms, carrots, meat and broccoli in gravy. Its great to have and enjoy the dish with a Thai tea to wash it down smooth. For dessert I will get either a Coconut Ice Cream or Sticky Rice with Mango</Text>

<review>Simply Thai at its best. In a few years, this restaurant will be the one thing I will remember about dating the dumbest meanest girl I ever ate dinner with.

They love the Mack & Cheese, but it can be alot more tasteful so adult can enjoy it also.
2 years ago when i frequently visit the zoo,  i use to ask for the chicken salad sandwich to be made into a wrap, but i was inform that manager woulnt let them do it anymore! Sad but over all its great place to eat with your kids and make memories, but it can be very pricey for a family who lives in a budget.< /Review><Rate>4</Rate>< name>

It was nice and it had 2 big fire place areas to keep you warm under the Kopje Lodge and it overlooks the Rhinos and other animals like you're in the Savannah.< /Review>

<review>Very nice cruise! Very happy to do it by Christmas! and I hope to go back soon. I like the discounted price and the 1 hour was really fair for it. Love the way people decorated their houses around the beach, beautiful lights at night.
Only thing I wish they have different choices for food, instead of cheetos and just hot dog. They have a restroom too which it's pretty convenient. Other than that I would give 5 stars.< /review><Resp>None</Resp><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsn6dlNNFVQw3dCe61u3C3cAdGU7HQkU4Z2cbJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvA-j6y5K4LYO_M3dtvdME54xs_sxXSYLijFpG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9WvF8h-trsnhQGFjaIql7TaUzJHUM4GgLRKNm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODVlQSp1tckMo3a9Q3cD9NSEtuFVlkWUNgadGk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnrhq6AGBa5JF9MkmlawNmo4CVRBzqGZzyuF7d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtsswRw7gnTurAmVwuSxZnJoF8jo95ZV2HCKt5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Rating>

We bought our tickets through Groupon for Davey's Locker. The boat was clean and they only allowed a small number of passengers. We stayed on the top deck the whole ride. It was a great time!! The houses looked amazing and there were so many boats! It was really a fun time!! I highly recommend it!!!</Text>

<text>Fantastic! Met a beautiful couple at the front of the boat and we waved and said Merry Christmas to all the other people on the water. It was magical! Highly recommend, the lights & scenery was beautiful. The boat captain was very kind, and the Christmas music was the old-fashioned ones so that was also fun to listen to.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcQXu2rXlDlJtlcnoJ1kU1LrFGHd8rPoXx5AlM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtL8oudnMt2VQaZvNQZPcU6Bk312a17GHxT5z6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhiBilpqstl_FQoqfJ8XxX4xAnw5toAHAErznU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dce06cba95f963:0x30b04159da61bf52< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We took my two boys, ages 7 and 3. It was beautiful and such a fun experience for us all. Ours was about an hour and a half which went by quite quickly. It was just the right amount of time for our kids though. They have restrooms, hot chocolate and popcorn. They even had adult beverages (adult hot chocolate and beer in a can). The crew was friendly and helpful. My 3 year old split his hot cocoa all down the front walkway of the boat. They were understanding and cleaned it up for us. I reccomend this for a family experience or even a nice  couple's date experience.</Text>< gmapID>

<text>The boat ride was pretty fun, it lasted a little over a hour long and I loved that they offered hot chocolate and plenty of other snacks and drinks to buy. The only bad thing was that hardly any boats were decorated or sailing around, we mainly had to look at the lights on the houses, that was disappointing but we understand that’s not the cruises fault. Maybe we try again next year when the virus dies down and hopefully more people will participate.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNns4INoMLAWlgZ1akrALLDJEQq4Za8VnP2RM0e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtlkgHRgjD5ft9UheQr7f5UhrW7_m9pSGKQXcg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEbNe42oTcpW7Ro-rSDFRpuCNNK9OIc5rd8vuM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2a8RbPG9IhZHm-K_oPkyrPTPVgjBHDXOc7l4l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzfdNGPDE40SvihflNum4xLZSTaMGs0_UGUJJZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_uzzUuzTb2_ro74eQqEf5niFvGTOMwSxYAfOQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbGIRbca_YFv8Bry1kM3pRPi97M_lGccNP-AW-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Always a great and reliable company whether fishing, whale watching or chartered boats for the Christmas lights and boats around Newport Harbor. Boats were not packed even though it looks like a lot of people, you had the option to stand or sit. T treehouse had light snacks and beverages for sale.  Make sure ALL of the people in your party check in together as they can’t give you tickets unless you are all there, so plan accordingly and make sure everyone is there.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYmaMQJxlFyP48SNSyOmyBIeiAeUXLsW6KVVYk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN04f6PS75eozTUWEBg5ejHfZ_u9snmEZuP7hM7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNXRd6AbNX0PyxjFjDORaZ4sB0zRe5y9wz0_sO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiANEOY8vz5mEHlk7auYPteATWpgW3fjY35X54=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNASee2lVYqa2Bzw1X2YSw-0G-h9dsh7-0GG-He=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPK9akXMZ2sALazvbRtrKO5MjWX7Okf48T29JkT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsjvkYIdmS4Znrv8GHqt4nSZ88DGezlL6wZ21j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeulGEGqLK8JC0O0Bvxz_cFZISsQ313XAc7mqj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMr8AfifpiMrOWBSxTMXiwOx4dfW2VS3rXR8xOZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyRAQqMnlVfNpZZPYsTJ4Hv9kXtxhkNdCKTeeI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRcpVnjxSodjaX3bVvsDKR0kPecN2SKg4PQ-zh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

<Review>My family and I had a really nice time last night looking at Christmas lights while cruising the Harbor.  Davey's Locker provided a safe and comfortable cruise through the Harbor for all ages. I highly recommend it. It was a fun way to enjoy some local traditional Christmas spirit.

<review>took my 3 year old for his birthday and he loved it! we all did, it was a Thursday evening, so not crowded at all, maybe 4 other small families, felt like we had the boat to ourselves. Bartenders were sweet, glad i was able to purchase a glass of wine, hot chocolate and a beer. i only gave it a 4 stars because the boat parade was cancelled that evening we were told after purchasing tickets. a few boats were still out there however not as many as we were expecting, but will be back next year. Thanks for the memories :)<//review>< user_id>

<text>This was so nice and enjoyable. My husband and I took our two boys to enjoy a nice evening on the water looking at some gorgeous Christmas lights and decorations. It was beautiful! This was all of our first times doing this. And we enjoyed it so much! It was perfect. Even the boys had so much fun looking at the gorgeous lights. Thank you to all the locals for displaying their beautiful lights and taking the time to dazzle us all! And thank you to the captain who drove the boat so well. We appreciate all of the staffs' hard work putting this together for us all. Merry Christmas and a safe and healthy New Year to all!</text>< pictures>

<text>What a pleasant and festive way to spend Christmas Eve, especially during the craziness of 2020 !  The Harbor Lights Cruise is a perfect relaxing way to ring in the Holiday Season.
The staff and crew are a relaxed but professional group that made getting tickets, checking in and boarding very easy, while upholding safety standards.  The boat was disinfected and cleaned between nightly cruises.  I'm certain I will be back to take the cruise in December 2021.  If you haven't been before, you have to try it.
I would not recommend this for younger kids.  Its about an hour long cruise and younger kids may get bored and fidgety. They have a cash bar on board for alcohol and hot chocolate if you're so inclined.  Be sure to tip to show your appreciation.  They do a fantastic job.  Enjoy!< /text>< pics>

<Review>I decided to do this year because my friend was in town and the boat parade was canceled in San Diego. This looked like fun. I recommend getting there early to find parking and the 4:30 boat ride. The sunset was beautiful. Go to the top and sit on the right side to see more of the lights. It says it’s an 90 minutes long but was only 65 minutes long was done by 5:35 pm. It was a good time and not too cold.</Review><user_id>111206108859654143436</user_id></record>

< Review>
Kind of a let down. Was expecting it to be like it was advertised. The mask policy was NOT enforced as there were people without a mask the entire 75minutes. Not to mention people standing in front of the view of what little lights there was... when it says no standing. Lights are NOT show boats but the housing/stores on shore. :(< /Review>

Very enjoyable! It was a beautiful little cruise around the harbor.  Perfect holiday date night! Boats were not over packed with people so there was plenty of room to maintain social distancing.  They do have a restroom on the boat and a bar - bring cash 😉<//Review>

The 75 minute cruise left and returned right on time.  It was well organized and enjoyable for all ages.  My only tiny complaint is that the holiday music was blasted so loudly on the top deck that people in my group could not talk to one another.  If you don't like talking with your relatives, this is perfect for you. Maybe they could run lines to other speakers to distribute the music more evenly. All in all - it was a very nice experience.<//review>

It was OK.  I don't feel like it was fair to sit on a side and your back was away from the lights and in order to social distant you had to stand or turn to lights in order to see them.  I would suggest inquiring more information but still a nice outing if you are looking for something to do.< /Text>

Went and saw the holiday lights in newport last night. All the employees were very nice, the boat clean and we left on time. Not that many houses decorated as expected but not their fault. Only thing that was frustrating bwas there were no signs for what boat to line up for so we did a lot of back and forth. So signage would be my only suggestion.< /text>

<text>Didn’t have a pleasant time. The boat crew were in a bad mood. I asked which boat I need to board and he told me to read my ticket and walked away. Once we got on the boat there was not enough places to sit so we had stand the whole time. Not that bug of a deal since all it did is a quick circle and right back. During hard times like Covid we are just trying to replace misery for a chance in sceneries and happiness. Please watch your bitterness and sarcasm. They don’t accept card on the boat and water was 2.00 and hit chocolate was 2.50. Expensive yes< /text>< name>

<text>Although the Christmas boat parade was offically cancelled because of covid our experience was awesome. Decided to do a boat ride to see lights and Davey's Locker was a great choice-they were friendly and went around the whole bay area. Also offered hot drinks. There were lots of decorated boats in the water and found out there was an unoffical boat parade so got to see that also! What a great time. It is a must see</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

I would have loved to go on the Newport Lights Cruise.  Due to a very loud mouthed Blonde Female, who treated me like a 5 year old. I was forced to miss my Boat Parade on New Years Day.< /text>

<Review>If I could give zero stars I would.  This Groupon was advertised as Christmas Boat Parade.  Without notification, it was changed to Holiday Lights Cruise which means you are just cruising around the bay looking at peoples lights who live there.  Nothing more than in our neighborhoods.  No Boat Parade!! They cancelled it and allowed us to take the cruise thinking we were going to see a Decoraded Boat Parade.  What a rip off!<//Review>< Pics>

<time>1608521771359< /time><rating>1</rating><review>Bad execution and planning on  Davey's this time. I was the first in line, which turned out to be the wrong line they sent us to. I showed up on time and waited in the wrong line for 1.30 minutes. The check in guy was rude and not listening to me when I told him i was there the 9 pm cruise. He checked me in and placed me on 830 cruise. That would have been ok, but I had more people coming far away for the 9 pm cruise. after noticing confusion with other people i went and inquired, they finally told me it was another line, walked us there and placed us in the back.<//review>< pictures>

first time trying this with the whole family. i  have to say if you do not like the cold you might want to book days with warmer temps. i was freezing but still enjoyed the sights. its actually very peaceful. easy boarding the boat which was called the fury. very nice  and polite  staff. also  very smart for the donut shop to stay open, hot chocolate really warmed us up after. i would recommend to others.</review>

<user>114705317293317296248< /user><Resp>None</Resp><text>First time going, don't think I'll ever go back. It wasn't too interesting. Staff were very inattentive. Walked all the way to Davey's Locker from parking lot on directions and was them told our boat was loading at Newport Beach where we walked past to get to Davey's Locker. We were then told that we'd have to walk back about 3-4 blocks with a 5 year old, 3 year and 1 year old in the rain.  I called to verify the cruise was still going since it was raining maybe it would have been nice to be told we were loading elsewhere when I mentioned we were on the 5:30 cruise.  Staff were busy trying to get tickets out to people and very short with us as if we knew anything about the area. Only about 1/2 of houses were decorated for light show. Told to come early there would be plenty to do, but only about 10% of businesses were even open before the cruise and then only 40% of the boardwalk businesses after the cruise. Even my teenagers were bored on this outing. Not a good pick for my family. The nicest person was the gentlemen selling hot chocolate everything else about this was horrible. Not many pictures with taking but I posted the only 2 I took. Boat was small too.<//text></record></dataset><record>

we had a great time with our family of 8. it was our first time doing a harbor cruise. valet was full but friendly and willing to accommodate us.  a bit of confusion during booking  as the website link i clicked said cruises 5:30 , 7, or 8:30 but redirected to a general ticketing page with more options available. ultimately it was my error booking on a cell phone and not checking my confirmation email; led to us missing the 4:30 cruise that i booked by mistake instead of the 5:30. by that time the 5:30 cruise was completely booked and we were put on a wait list. knowing its hard to accommodate our large family anyways, we walked down the boardwalk to find dinner and check out the fun zone.

5 stars earned: the hero of the company left his station at the (very busy) check in area to find our group in a little pizza place down the boardwalk, recognized me, and hand delivered our boarding passes for 5:30. "squeezing us into a fully booked charter", we were expecting a very crowded boat but were happy to find that on this fully booked boat there was plenty of room to walk around, and booths available inside by the fully stocked bar.

70 min cruise is the perfect amount of time with our 4 young children, (2 restless toddlers)  as we were able to see everything in that time.  we spent most of the cruise standing and walking around the boat (easily i might add) this leads me to believe alot of the bad reviews here have been addressed and this is a company that really listens to and cares about their customers.

we plan to do it again next year and also plan to do a deep sea fishing charter this summer.</text>

We went on the last Christmas Boat parade tour which left at 8:30PM on Sunday.  It was a little confusing on which line to stand in since there was a 8:10pm tour and our tour.  Turns out we were in the 8:10 line but when we got to the end of the line we found ourselves at the beginning of the 8:30 line...so not a problem.

The captain did an excellent job of pointing out interesting homes and boats to focus on.  He also got us out to his favorite spot for both some beautiful homes and a few businesses.  Great tour...well worth it and very enjoyable.  Will do again...good value.  And no rain even though it was predicted.</review>

VERY disappointed with boat parade cruise from Dave's locker. Saw very little of the parade and decorated boats. We followed the end of the parade and so none of the colorful boats went past us. Our group goes every year and this was the worst tour. Going back to boat company I used last time where we had a position on the water and saw all the beautiful boats, and cruised to both ends of harbor, not just half of it with Dave's tour. Ride only last an hour. Other boat company's rides were 1 1/2 hours. We could have seen the parade better standing on the pier. Sorry we went with them.</review>

<date>1577031380005</date><Text>Giving them a 2 because the staff was nice. This year we were on the Fury which was a much smaller boat from prior years. The seating was awful. Most people had to just stand on the side to get a good view. My family sat inside with a half view of the boats due the glare of lights banking off the glass. The table across from us had two young adults that spent most of the hour making out and feeling each other up & down. It would have nice if the bartender would have said something. Last year was amazing on the Freelancer with Davey's Locker. Next year we'll be trying something new with a better experience.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>The only reason I'm giving a two-star is that the staff was friendly.  I have gone on many Davey's Locker boat trips and have had really good experiences but this was not one of them.  First, our group got split onto different boats because we were not told we had to check in together to be on the same boat...this was very, very disappointing because it was 1 couple out of 6 couples that ended up by themselves!!  And when we got on our boat, there were no seats so we had to stand the entire time, very bad because we had an elderly lady with us and she could have used a seat.  Why on earth would you take people out on a 1-1/2 hour cruise and not have a boat with seats???  And we were supposed to be part of the parade but come to find out, the 5:30 boat is not in the parade at all..our trip was ending as all the boats were coming together at the start.  So we didn't even get to see the decorated boats because we were heading back to the dock.  Don't advertise this as a Christmas boat parade cruise when actually it was just a harbor cruise to see the decorated houses.<//Text><Rate>2< /Rate>< date>

<review>We did the holiday lights cruise 12/31/19, this was our 2nd year. Fun, beautiful lights, a super nice evening together. Go early and have dinner in Newport Beach, then walk to Davey's, walk around and shop a bit if you have extra time. We highly recommend this.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dce06cba95f963:0x30b04159da61bf52</Gmap_id><Rating>5<//Rating><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Time>

Can't really blame the cruise for the lame home decorations.  Very few homes go all out.  The rest were nothing spectacular and many were not decorated at all.  Paid a high price, not worth it.  Better off walking thru Santa Claus Lane in Torrance.  We also purchased a drink ticket with our cruise.  It didn't get me a drink!  It got me $5 off a $13 rum and coke.  Lame!< /Review>

We were very disappointed in the boat parade this year. We were on the 5:30 boat “Fury”. It was a smaller boat than the previous year but more crowded. People were stepping on each other to see. They rushed us on and told us we would have more time. Then they brought us back early and we did not see any of the parade. We ended up staying on the boardwalk and watching as the boats passed by. If they were not able to stay for some of the boat parade they should change their descriptions of the tours. Don’ t think we will be back🙁< /text>

<review>This is definitely the best way to watch the boat parade -- to be right in the middle of it!  Buy a cup of hot chocolate for the kids; treat yourself to a glass of wine or a beer, and have a close up experience.  But come early.  If you don't, there is never enough seating!< /review>< pictures>

The company had 3 boats touring, so they were all lit up, and running the bay. From what we saw on Youtube, many more houses were lit up in the past, so we were really disappointed by how few lighted houses there were. For how cold you are on the boat for the hour, it's not worth just seeing the few houses, better to just drive around the neighborhoods of the mansions to see even more houses.<//review>< Pics>

First time. We were on the 8:45pm boat and were only in the parade a little bit and only saw decorated boats close up for a short time and then road around by ourselves as parade had dissipated and deserted us .plenty of seating on top level. Nice staff.<//review>

<review>Went out on the Fury this year, which had very little seating. If you are older or have any kind of disability or injury that would make sitting more important you should check with them to see if you can get matched so a specific boat.  Because it was basically all standing room, if you were standing near the bathroom doors you were getting whacked or had to keep moving.  Same if you were near the bar entrance. The pathway is very narrow and people kept hitting you who were coming and going for drinks.  Staff and crew were friendly.< /review>< Pictures>

We did not feel like we were part of the boat parade at all on the 5:30 p.m. sailing. I would recommend the 7:00 p.m. sailing. For the 5:30 p.m. sailing the boats were not even lined up for the boat parade yet.< /Review>

<rate>2< /rate><text>we were a large group with two separate reservations, we did a separate check in  for each group 10 min gap to find out that we are not on the same boat. we went back to thy guy and he goes I will do it this time but next time you need to check in at the same time I was like how i am supposed to know. Boat is scheduled 8:30 pm, they haven't started boarding until 8:45, also, No enough seats on the boat, we were standing the whole trip. in conclusion, nothing too impressive I would prefer morning boats much better.</text>< username>

Fun family outing for the holidays. I would recommend taking one of the evening tours to ensure that you can see more houses lit up. The cruise was very relaxing and will definitely get you into the holiday spirit.<//Review>

<text>It was a wonderful cruise. We stayed with the kids at the lower deck most of the time but the real beauty of the cruise is on the top deck from where you really experience the Christmas lights and decorations.  My only complaint is that the music was too loud and there are speakers every few feet away. So you can’t really get away from the sound. Also it is hard to have a conversation because of the volume. But I would go back again next year with ear muffs.<//text>< pics>

We did this Christmas Eve. Boat was small and packed. They evidently have a cash bar but there were so many people you couldn’t get there. No Christmas music or anything festive...seemed like any other day. Lights are awesome but you can see them better walking the Island.<//review>

This was the first time for my husband and I and we thoroughly enjoyed the cruise. My husband needs a cane to walk due to knees and hip replacements. He was able to board first and the crew was very helpful with helping him board and getting off the boat. I would definitely recommend this cruise.< /review>

It was a delightful trip around the harbor.  Not sure it is worth the full price but discounted price from Groupon was just fine.  Very festive!  Great crew!< /text>

I went and saw the Christmas lights on Balboa Island last night and was somewhat disappointed. The staff were not as friendly as last year and I did not care for the boat we were on. I thought we would be on the same boat which was much larger and not as crowded as this one. Additionally, they left the lights on inside that took away from the ambiance of the cruise and the Christmas light show. I asked one of the staff members if they would be pointing out where some of the celebrities used to live and the staff member told me that they never did that, however they were wrong because it was done last year! When I explained this to the staff member the individual told me that that was done last year to excite people, and in his three years of working this cruise he had never experienced it. It gave me the impression that he thought I was lying or that the prior staff member last year was just trying to add hype to the cruise. Nevertheless, the cruise was doable but I will definitely reconsider whether or not I will come back next year.< /Review>

The boat ride was fine. Nothing to write home about. Very disappointed because when I made the reservation the rep told me that on that night, the night before the actual parade starts the next day, we would see hundreds of decorated boats. We saw maybe 5 that sailed by. Very misrepresented night. Just glad I didn’t pay a lot of money because I used Groupon. Buyer beware.</Text>

Took the holiday lights cruise with my family last night and was totally underwhelmed.

We first went to check in the location that was provided to us, and were told that they moved it so we had to walk to another location.   Then we were told to standby a sign and wait; there was no staff around the crowd that was cutting in line. We then boarded the boat and cruised around for the alotted time without seeing one staff member or heard any interesting commentary about the cruise itself. Some of the houses were decorated and some were not. At the end of the cruise we finally saw 2 staff members; one had a tip jar in hand. Not sure why a tip was deserved.

The excursion is overrated and overpriced for what it is. I felt that I wasted my time and money, and would not recommend this company for this cruise.<//text>

I am giving a two is because the staff was very friendly.  I am very disappointed with boat parade from Dave's Locker. We reserved thought we are part of the parade but we didn't get a chance to see the parade at all. Our tour took off early and returns before the parade started.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Wonderful, crazy Beauty parade! Everyone is trying to decorate their boats with lights and musical special effects. Many arrange theater repertoires right at the stern! Everyone needs to see it!

Замечательный, сумасшедшей Красоты парад! Все стараются украсить свои лодки огоньками и музыкальными спецэффектами. Многие устраивают театральные репризы прямо на корме! Всем надо это увидеть!< /Text>

<text>Horrible!!
They use to be amazing!
Now they are mediocre at best :'(
Just look at their Tom Yum soup with beef!!  It use to be a super rich, white broth with an amazingly complex flavor.
But now, all of a sudden, it is a disappointing brown broth soup with mushrooms....

<Review>Went here for the first time tonight, AMAZING. Outstanding service, I believe it was the owner who took our order and told us it would be 20-25 minutes, and the food was ready on time. Large portions and the best Thai I have ever had. I got the pork drunken noodle spicy. My wife got the chicken pad Thai not spicy, and we ordered a beef Thai salad as well. The meat was tender on everything, the noodles were great and the salad was outstanding! We will be eating here again and sharing this place with all of our friends!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Text>I'm not sure why I even give this place 1 star except the lady was very nice.  This place use to be awesome.  Came back and it was horrible.  The mango was green and unripe in the salad. The Tom Yum soup was brown water with mushrooms and chicken.  No galangal, lemon grass, fish oil. Horrible flavor.  Tried to take it back up to the window and they were closed. Such a shame.</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808035790e7a0cad:0x14badc2acc9de2da</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>One more thai restaurant on our visit to Mendocino.
We ordered yellow curry, roti and Shrimp pineapple rice.
Food is good but it could have been better.
Roti was bit oily and the Shrimp was bland.
The good thing is the portion of food is big, usually we ordered 2 items for 2 of us and are able or finish it.
This time we have to take Togo everything.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuUVKht7Pp54fsEPtfs-nyBDahpoQTqAfMwP6a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzjzkpIgxovrZ6Fe-4QJqjPN8RwFcmfg23W30V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0aMw2dk2W-BUpdH6KxVLpE8MA_iuxZcTJwUP0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Ate here for the first time the other day and I am nothing but pleased!! The staff was very friendly,  the prices are reasonable and the food is AMAZING. Its a shame with COVID they cannot outdoor dine or have people stay. I can’t wait to go back as this is a restaurant I’d love to support.< /Review>

Thai Basil Shrimp tastes just so so. Pad Woon Sen has large portions with a good flavor.

But they forgot the Thai tea! Not sure if they forgot regularly or just once. Overall, it’s a ok Thai restaurant.</Review>

<text>Literally so good. I was here for dinner 2 days ago and still thinking about it. I shared the fried chicken and drunken noodles with a friend and we left SO happy. Noodles were generous with lots of good veggies and chicken. Usually I pick through stuff like that but I was too focused on shoving it in my mouth to do that. The fried chicken with lime sauce was so good I saved a tiny bit at the corner of my plate to end my meal with and let me tell you, GREAT DECISION. The sales that came with it was also great. The magnum opus, however, was definitely their homemade chili garlic sauce. They sell it at the restaurant and I knew from the first bite I wasn't leaving without a container of it. It was so flavorful and a great level of spice. I can't wait to cook with it at home.

Also the restaurant is family ran and the two sisters waiting on us were so sweet and welcoming. Honestly if you only have one meal in Fort Bragg, I would recommend here.< /text>< pics>

<Text>COVID-19 diaries: They have parking out in front and eqsy access.Only takeaways no dine in. We tried the pho, which we liked and a stir fry, which we didn't. The pho broth tasted nice and its quantity was insane (will last you 3 meals). The vegetables in the pho had been overcooked. The stir fry was mostly cabbage and the vegetables were soggy with all the sauce.< /Text><user>104787075117568838642< /user>< rate>

Some of the friendliest people we have met. They found out my friend was celebrating his birthday, and three waitresses came out and sang happy birthday. The food was excellent too! The restaurant was located in an historic lumber company office building converted into retail shops but full of old photos of the days it was used as a lumber company HQ. A great place to visit and enjoy a great meal with good company!<//Text>

We passed this town today while visiting Albion. With covid going on and passing thru town I'm glad they had a little sitting area out in the hall since dining in was not an option. The food was delicious full of flavors! Even my parents agree. I highly recommend. If you are visiting and looking for an authentic Thai restaurant look no further.</Review>

We took to go two curries red and green, both with shrimp: curry was fine, but there was no rice  (which we didn’t realize until we tried to eat it on the beach) and no spoons (quite difficult to eat curry with a fork..) Moreover shrimps were way overcooked.</Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>If you want good Thai, this is the right place. If you want a fusion restaurant, you'll want to look elsewhere. The "fusion" is your typical mixture of Thai and Laotian dishes. With the exception of a couple items, everything on the menu is exactly what you would expect to find at a normal Thai restaurant. The food is good, and I would eat here again. It's just not what I expected based on the name.<//review>< pics>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Excellent Thai restaurant. Waitress was prompt, polite, and professional. Food arrived quickly, was of high quality, and was perfectly seasoned. Prices are fair and portions are generous. I ordered the Thai Basil (Pad Graw Prow), chicken, Thai hot. The chicken pieces were juicy and on the larger size, which I prefer, and the chili sauce was sweet with enough of a syrupy character to nicely coat the vegetables and chicken. There were plenty of chopped Bird peppers to get the heat level up, although this dish today was not what I'd consider a "10" on the heat scale, more like 8.5. I feel confident that they could make it hotter if requested.

This is a young restaurant, and it warmed my heart to see lots of people coming in to eat as we were eating. I want to eat here again on my next visit to Fort Bragg!< /Review>< Pics>

We passed by Asian Fusion Sea Valley  on the way back from Oregon trip. Well-balanced of spicy and sweet flavor with Thai seasoning merged into Mango Salad, Tom Yum Soup, and Angel Chicken that we ordered. It was surprisingly delicious! Dishes' presentation and portion size were great. I would like to go back and order same dishes again.< /text>

<Review>VERY friendly staff, great pho and pad thai. Will definitely be returning next time I come through Fort Bragg. They also have a bunch of different house made sauces chillin on each table. All the sauces are really great and I highly recommend if you visit here that you try them all. This really is a great establishment and I wish we had more restaurants as good as this one where I live.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Literally $20 for one pad Thai with tofu, worse I’ve ever had in my life.
Noodles were soggy and swimming in very sour sweet and sour sauce. Clear veggies. The extra $4 you pay for tofu gets you three wet chunks out of the box.
Awful. Just awful.
Edit: the chef informed me that someone had switched the pad Thai sauce to salad dressing, which explained why it was horrible. She gave me a new meal for free and it was much better. still not worth $20 but raising to 2 stars for the hospitality.<//Text><date>1624407669792</date><Response>None< /Response><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Rating>

I’ve been their client for 4+ years, and have no complaints. Robert is professional and quick to respond to any questions or concerns. The company does a good job of screening potential renters and have filled vacancies in less than two weeks. Delight Sittman in the business office is also professional and responds to questions even if it is after business hours. They are very customer focused and a pleasure to work with.<//Text>

Prior to coming across PMI, our experience with finding a rental was really depressing and discouraging.  PMI made the application process simple, they were super accommodating when it came to viewing the property and asking any questions we had.

Tracie is a delight and Michael was so willing to listen to our story.  Two weeks after moving in they are great at following up.

I highly recommend working with this property management company.</Text>

Delight and Rob of Patron Property Management have done a great job managing my property for over 4 years. They are genuinely nice people who return calls promptly and do all necessary repairs in a timely fashion and at a reasonable cost. They are up to date on all the current laws such as those pertaining to smoke and CO2 alarms. My statement is posted online every month and the rent is direct deposited into my account. It’s a very seamless system for me and I’m very happy knowing my property is being taken care of and that my tenant continues to enjoy living in my property! I would definitely recommend them! Thank you Delight and Rob!<//review>

I recently had the pleasure to meet with Rob and Tracie.  They are on point.  We were unhappy with trying to manage our tenant and maintenance issues.  We are inexperienced with dealing with the woes of being landlords.  We are happy to let Rob and his team take over rent payments, maintenance and tenant communication.  PMI Patron has so much to offer and would definitely refer them to family and friends.</text>

Patron Property Management has been managing our property for the past 3+ years since we moved out.  Rob and Delight made the process to prep our townhome and get renters quick and easy for us.  Tracie is on top of coordinating with us when necessary and facilitating communication between our tenants and ourselves.  Their communication is wonderful and their prices are reasonable.  I cannot say how much we appreciate working with them!< /Review>

I highly recommend Patron Property Management. We had never used a PM before when renting our house and we had some initial concerns. But Rob answered all of our questions and did an excellent job of finding us great tenants. We have peace of mind knowing that Rob and his staff are taking care of everything for us.  Plus our tentants have never missed paying the rent even during the pandemic.  I gave them five stars because of how professional and trustworthy Patron Property Management is.< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>The day I met Delight Sittman and Rob Sittman, the days of a challenging rental were over.  I never knew things could be so easy!  With a former PM I was called and asked about everything  and went through numerous tenants.  With Patron they take care of things seamlessly!  I honestly believe it's why tenants stay as their needs are met immediately.  Since Patron took over my rental their first placement has been with us 3-1/2 years and, to my knowledge, have no intention to move.  I LOVE PATRON PROPERTY MANAGEMENT!</Review>< pictures>

Our grandma passed away recently and our family inherited the home she lived in for over 50 years. We wanted to keep it instead of selling it, but we didn’t feel like handling the process of finding a tenant and everything else. Plus everything with Covid 19 and the new laws made us nervous. We started doing some research online and we found Patron Property Management. They contacted us immediately after we visited their website. Rob met with us at my grandmas home to go over what needed to be done to the house in order to get it ready to rent. We signed a contract and they took care of the rest. Tracie did a great job finding a tenant for us. We have been receiving our monthly check with no issues, even during Covid. This company is small and offers great service. I trust them to handle any situation quickly and effectively. Another great thing is they have a month to month contract so I am not locked in long term. They also have a money back guarantee if we weren’t satisfied with the service.<//text>

<Review>Disclosure: I'm a homeowner and we're 1 month into the business relationship. Also, this is the first time I've hired a Property Management Company so I'm not sure what one would generally expect.

That said, DMS has been great. They found a tenant at an appropriate price point with only ~10 days notice and were incredibly responsive during the process. Rob has been particularly hands on and helped work with me coordinating schedules and necessary repairs. At this point, I'd recommend them and will be sure to update my review for better or worse in the future.</Review><user>104768193278535801129</user><name>Ardeshir Pezeshk< /name><date>1506084183829< /date></record></dataset><record>
<Review>Just signed my lease last Monday with Robert at DMS and I can say that the experience has been incredible and smooth.  I love that they are up to date with technology...I can pay my rent online!  I can also request maintenance items and such through their portal.  I'm not a big fan of having to drive or mail my rent check in or leaving messages and waiting for call backs so this is a HUGE plus in my book.  The lease was even an easy online process as well.  No need to keep a copy of it in paper form.  I highly recommend using their services and they are very pleasant and courteous.< /Review>< username>

Wonderful FAMILY owned and run business. They seem to know most of the owners of the properties personally, and they take a lot of pride in finding the right people for each of their homes. I recently moved in and it was an easy and friendly experience. I am looking forward to a long relationship with DMS and am so happy to be out of the large corporation-run apartments. A happy renter is a loyal renter!</Text>

<review>What can I say? Robert made a very stressful across country move easy and seamless. My family and I were relocating to SoCal from WA and had a whole 8 days to move. In my house hunting trip I was having no success finding a nice suitable home for my family. Then I found a house managed by DMS Property management and WOW! They made it easy from the very beginning. Being able to apply online, sign my lease online, pay rent online, etc. is very convenient. My property has been well maintained and the landscaping is gorgeous! Did I mention we have a landscaper that is included in our rent? I recommend this company highly. Thank you Robert and Delight for making our move a happy one.< /review>< pictures>

They have done a wonderful job on managing my four-plexes. Delight was also involved in assisting me in the purchase of the property. You can always count on them to return your call promptly.  Recently I had a vacancy and there were a lot of repairs to be done. But DMS was able to clean up the place and even rent it out at a higher rate with a very short period of vacancy. I highly recommend DMS and I will definitely use them in all my future rental purchases.< /Review>

DMS Property Management is great! They've been managing a home I inherited from my dad for two years and it's been going perfectly from day one.  They oversaw some major refurbishing that was needed and then interviewed and found a perfect tenant very quickly.  I love that that the monthly rent checks are automatically deposited to my account and that I receive an online statement.  Robert Sittman is an attentive and conscientious property manager who I know I can call on with any questions or problems.<//review>

<text>We are renters of DMS Property Management and have loved working with Delight and Robert. We had a clogged drain the other day in our home and they had a plumber call us and come out and snake the drain less than 2 days later. We have never received service that fast before. We have also loved paying rent online. We have never been able to pay rent online before and it makes it so much easier to get our monthly payment in. DMS Property Management has been great to work with.</text>< Pictures>

< review>
My husband and I had our final military move (from Virginia) last year after he retired from the Airforce. Anyone who's done this knows that despite some perks it can be a tedious experience. Delight, within DAYS, found us a place that fit us perfectly. Not only is it within our budget, it's possibly my favorite place that I've lived in with my husband. We thought with the CA cost of living we'd have to settle and the opposite happened. She found us everything we needed and most importantly, the owner and DMS were able to accommodate our two cats.

Delight, Rob, and the team are easily accessible and I trust them, which I can't say about every property manager we've had. Perhaps the most telling factor is that after years of accepting the fact that you can't tell how happy you will feel by just looking at a place, my husband and I are both still very pleased with the choice we made to take this place and that is something we owe to this company. I feel pretty lucky with DMS in our first new place in Orange County. Thanks guys!<//review>

<Text>I have had a tenant living in my two bedroom rental condo for 30 years and I recently wanted to have him sign a new lease with my wife and me. I wanted to make sure that I was compliant with all of the current tenant-landlord laws so I gave Robert Sittman a call at DMS Property Management. He came over to our house and helped us fill out a new lease for the tenant along with a lead based paint addendum. He was pleasant to work with and was familiar with many of the new tenant-landlord laws. I feel confident about our new lease agreement with our tenant and I feel much more protected against a lawsuit. Thank you so much DMS Property Management!</Text>< pics>

I have been using DMS Property Management for several years now, I am always happy when my monthly check is deposited into my personal bank account. Using a property manager to take care of a single family house is a great way to take the pressure of dealing with tenants out of the rental property equation. The staff at DMS is great about taking care of repairs and the only time I hear from the City is when they tell me that the property has onec again won a beautification award.< /review>

Robert and Delight at DMS Property Management have been great to work with. They have been managing properties for almost 30 years and they seem to know how to handle any situation that comes there way. They have been nothing but courteous to me whenever I have needed them.</text>

Arranged a tour of a property and they confirmed the time twice the last time 4 hrs before the tour but they no showed. They did text an access code to tour the property alone but the code didn't work. Poor customer service  to their customers and prospects AVOID!< /text>

Cute place and really delicious food! I talked to someone that I'm assuming was the owner and he was very nice and very helpful. I wanted to order one of everything, but had to contain myself, I will be back to eat my way through the menu for sure!<//text>

<Review>Here is what to expect at ReMix Asian Kitchen: very small serving sizes, extremely overpriced prices(including a 5.4% covid fee), and the aesthetic that would appeal to a 10yr old. Dining in will take you back to your elementary school days, as you'll receive your tiny meal on a colorful tray surrounded by some iconic childhood characters on the wall. Relive what it was like eating in the cafeteria and talking about naruto with your friends. If you like paying $20 for TV dinners, this is the place for you!<//Review><UserId.>112068609664705984743<//UserId.><rating>1</rating><response>{'time': 1618452011043, 'text': 'Not sure what you ordered, but we have meals that start at $10.95 and our portions are quite generous.

I am not a ramon fan but this place was really good. 👌 I read the hater talking about the prices...umm...if you can't afford to eat really good ramon maybe you should just stick with 25 cent top ramon? It's not even that expensive and you get 2 meals out of one order.... the man that worked there was very friendly... the gyoza/dumplings and potato macaroni salad were amazing.... My friends who have to drive to little Tokyo just for some good ramon said this place is definitely right up there with the place they like in little Tokyo... so they must be doing something right! =)< /Review>

<text>Korean BBQ tacos were okay, lemon pepper chicken was great but needs more sauce. Staff was friendly and they let you same items before choosing.

Love the variety available here, however I think updated menus are needed. They have so many options but the items are scattered everywhere on the walls behind the counter it's hard to really see what your options are. Plus you wouldn't know there was a coffee menu until you get to the register or if you intentionally came here for that.

Overall, I'm excited to be back to try some more.< /text><UserId.>112716881170751314545</UserId.><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80ea43dbad4ba551:0x850b423d13bc835b<//gmapID><username>Alexis Nichelle<//username>< rate>

Oh. My. God. This place is so underrated! The food here is on another level. I got the ramen bowl with dumplings and I had to stop myself from absolutely devouring everything at an unholy speed. My body will not thank me, but my mind will. My soul is replenished, and my enemies have no power against me. I am one with the ramen and the ramen is with the sh*ts.< /Review>

I had the ramen and it was very good! I have had quite a few different ramens from different places and this is definitely in my top 5 favorites! Everything is reasonably priced and it did not seem too busy so the food came out pretty quick! Overall, I highly recommend this place to any ramen lover!<//Review>

Came in for a quick bite with friends and was very happy here. The cashier was very welcoming and definitely knew the menu (helping us to decide). Tried the Korean Saltados and Chicken Katsu. Both were great. The fries were not soggy at all, the rice was perfect and Chicken was amazing. No gross fatty or grisly pieces - it was a nice breast and just the right amount of breading.< /text>

This new spot is a must try!! Right when you walk in, it gives an Asian Kitchen ambiance type of feel. Came here with my friend for lunch and we had the chicken fritter plate, shrimp fritter plate, the avocado toast, and for dessert the mochi balls (satisfied my sweet tooth).Everything tasting SUPER DELICIOUS. Fritter plates arrives with a house potato salad and a side of purple rice that complimented the dishes really well!! So many great flavors being made in this kitchen and you can definitely tell everything was made authentically. ReMix Asian Kitchen & Ramen hotsauce has a good kick that paired very well on top of my crunchy chicken breast. I also had some of my friends shrimp and it was super juicy and fairly huge which I was super happy about. Flavors were phenomenal and portion  sizes and prices were fair. Definitely recommend this gem, totally worth it !!!<//Review>

<Text>I love this place! This is fusion done right! The chef is super creative and detailed in the way he composes each dish. I can tell because everything is balanced in terms of flavor, contrasting textures and overall presentation.  Food comes out pretty quick considering I can tell it mostly from scratch.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Truly one of the best places I have eaten at for Asian themed food. It was delicious, well cooked, they handled my custom order just fine, and was very clean. It's worth the trip there, even from Visalia. You won't regret it.< /text>

Delicious, fresh and something different. Friendly staff, nice quiet location. Fun theme and if you listen carefully, even the background music is a "remix".<//Review>

My husband and I love this place. We go there often and my husband is trying everything on their menu. So far his favorite item is the Po Boy Sandwich. Their shrimp tacos are delicious, any pork item is flavorful and tender and their ramen is SO GOOD. Give it a try! You won't be disappointed!</Text>

The food was great, love it. The con part of it is that some of serving are to small, my first time there I had to wait about two hours to get 3 orders. I would suggest more help in the dining area. The server was very kind. Hope maybe in my next visit I can give you my 5 star.<//Text>

Delicious!  It was a spur of the moment thing since we were both busy (I, in school and he, in church), and since it’s Valentine’s Day, why not try something new. So glad I googled and found this resto. My hubby got the Indonesian Style beef curry plate, our son (the camera man) got the Japanese chicken ramen and I, to be on the safe side got the KBBQ plate.  The owner/chef was so nice and served us a slice of mango key lime pie- a freebie! Yummy!< /Text>

ReMix is an excellent place for traditional Korean food. It's very bright and clean in all respects. The food plates are plentiful and filling. I highly recommend this place for those that enjoy good Korean Cafe food. We will continue to enjoy the ReMix in the future.< /text>

The location isn't easy to find, but definitely worth the effort. ReMix Asian Kitchen is a family-owned business that offers fusion style food unavailable elsewhere in Bakersfield. Everything here is excellent and Sung (owner/chef) often has new dishes that he will happily offer samples of. They also take the time to explain each dish, which sometimes make your decision more difficult. 😊 They offer catering, so you can share the goodness with family and friends.<//review>

I love the food here. Whenever I go I tell myself I will get something else other than the Ramen Bowl but then when I am there I cant think of any other food item other than the Ramen bowl.

I came here on the recommendation of a friend, who spoke highly of it. I came with high expectations, and was well satisfied. The food is not cheap, at between 10-15 dollars a plate, but it was well worth it. I had the Korean French dip, and it honestly exceeded my expectations. We ordered 5 things, between my party, and had nothing but good things to say.< /review>

What a hidden gem!  Take the time to get to this yummy cafe tucked away in a medical complex area.  Wonderful Asian fusion blended with southern comfort food.  Highly recommended.  Prices quite reasonable. Great addition to the Bakersfield foodie scene.< /review>

< review>
I was the first customer of the day as was greeted by the owner and again at the counter by a cashier. I was drawn inside by their outside board showing breakfast items and different types of coffee, the one being a salted caramel mocha was what caught my attention. I also saw the note showing coffee being offered hot or cold. I walked in hoping the cold part meant I could get it blended. Well I ordered it and asked if they blend their mochas here and no they don't so I asked for it to be iced. Their POS (point of sale) machine wouldn't accept my card so I paid cash. While I waited I noticed the cleanliness of the place and saw everything stocked. When I got my coffee it was piping hot and I asked the gal if I could get ice and she looked at me crazy and said ice?! I said yes this is the only way to turn this very hot coffee into the cold one I ordered. She pointed to the soda machine and let me know that's where I can get my ice. After all was said and done the mocha actually was very plain and without a lot of flavor. In fact I added sugar!!< /review>

A great place for take-out, and something different. We enjoyed our meal and the service was friendly, although I live on the opposite end of town from them (so it's a little inconvenient for us).</text>

<text>In the middle of this business center lies ReMix. This modern asian kitchen with a wide variety of dishes. Prices go from moderate too high (depending on if you like Lobster) but the amount of food easily justifies the cost. There's a cute bit of wall art representating various types of nerd culture. At the time I visited (around 4) it was empty enough to enjoy a conversation with a friend. The manager even came by to ask how the food was.
Highly recommended.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

The flavors of the food we got were on point. The serving sizes were large.  I got the spicy pork Hawaiian plate lunch and gyoza, my wife got ramen with a side of katsu chicken.  We loved everything. We will eat here again for sure.<//Text>

Came on a Saturday early evening. We were greeted and asked if it was our first time visiting.  They told us what was popular on the menu and offered several samples. Wow the flavors were great. I got the tri-tip sandwich and my husband got the shrimp lunch plate. Both were fantastic. We will have to go back several times to try the many very different items on the menu.</Text>

It's in a hidden location but worth the search. The food is an interesting combination of Korean, Japanese, and other cultural flavors. It was a great way to enjoy breakfast in a different way than the usual fare.<//Text>

<Review>If you like a change from simple Asian food then this is the place. Located in the medical plaza across from CSUB.  The coffee is amazing! Must try churro coffee.  The staff is friendly and sweet. The meat loaf is  perfectly seasoned with the best sauce I ever tasted. Must try. The area is perfect if your stopping by for a doctors appointment or want a quiet place to relax. The prim rib sandwich is super tender that it tears apart easily. I highly recommend going! five stars all the way!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Love it! But there's so many things they have that aren't on the menu (please update paper menu!) that I want to try!< /Review>

This is the perfect place for that person who wants to try something new!!!! Came in on the weekend for lunch. Very friendly staff and the owner came out to ask how the food was. This was an extremely pleasant environment and meal. You just can't find good interesting food like this in Bakersfield.  Please order the spam and egg musubi. It's a sight to see in bakersfield and it is hands down the most perfect portable food.   I will return on a regular bases.<//Text>

I read about this place in the Sunday Bakersfield Californian and wanted to try it. The food is delicious. We had the bulgogi tri-tip and the North Shore shrimp as well as the spam musubi. All fabulous. Like eating in Hawaii.<//text>

Unfortunately, the service was a pretty slow but would definitely come back again.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNozx9EJ6a9--k2SIdMKHgJFl4ZhLOz3h-q9IzW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

I adore this spot! They prepare great dishes, their menu is nice, The chef in that spot is a real pro, I like very much tasting all their dishes. The dishes are always tasty, the service towards the customers  is efficient. I  go often to this place and I not even once was unhappy. I recommend this place.< /Review>

I love Indian food and have tried several restaurants throughout the so Cal area. I was excited to try Flavor of India. However I was left feeling unsatisfied with the entire experience.

After waiting for a table on a busy Friday night, I was finally seated only to wait another additional 20 minutes before anybody came to take my order. I ordered samosas,  chicken Tikka, lamb vindaloo,  Naan,  and rice.
The samosas were not that great. It was rather dull in taste and complexity compared to the fragrance of spices I'm accustomed to in Samosas.
After waiting for another 20 mins, the food starting to come one by one. First was the chicken Tikka. Again. Disappointing from the chicken Tikka I have had other places. Not to say it was bad, but it lacked the unique char and smoked taste that is the signature taste of anything made in the clay oven. It just tasted like regular ol chicken fajitas.
Next the lamb vindaloo. Again the trend continues. Something lacking in the overall flavor profile compared to other versions I've tried.
The saag alo was good, however the potatoes were UNDERCOOKED and just ruined the dish for me. The rice that I ordered never came. Which was just disappointing. Nobody ever came to check on me for well over 30 mins. By the time I could get somebody, to tell them about the rice. The kitchen was already closed. It was just a disappointing experience for me overall and won't be back. The food is by no means bad, it's just not that great either. I think there are much better places to get your Indian fix on.</Text>

Everything was well seasoned and tasty. The garlic naan was so good and perfect for scraping off the leftover sauce from our plates. All round a very pleasant meal.<//Text></record>

last night was the first time we came to that excellent restaurant. But It is obviously not the last time. We enjoyed the evening very much with the attentive service, with the superb cooking and fine drinks and with the modest cost. We will surely return there soon.</review>

The worst food quantity food I have ever received, I paid 45 bucks and didn't even get quantity to be good enough for one person. When I called to ask , they hung up on me.  Would definitely recommend everyone to avoid ordering from this place.  Rudest staff and most unprofessional service you could expect.  On top of that stale food.</review>

So since I did mot know what I wanted (I recently switched to a vegan diet and was never a big fan of Indian food) I orderes the buffet (since 4 of the options were vegan) and I ordered a mulligatawney soup off the menu.  Everything was so good.  I asked for some extra spice for the soup and they briup me this green chili puree that I added to the soup and it just set off all of the flavors.  I even took a soup to go. The spinach saag was another eye opener.  I never knew steamed spinach could taste so good.  I mixed the saag with some lentil, veggie rice and lime and that green sauce and it was heavenly.  Let me tell you, my eyes are wide open now and I can't beliwvw I have been missing out on Indian food my whole life! The server was excellent! He took the time to point out all pf the vegan options from the buffet and which dressing was vegan as well for my salad.  The menu has a whole page of vegan options, most are also gluten free! Love this place.  So happy I wandered in.< /Review><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

Naan and vegetables entrees were great though vegetable biriyani was like tomato rice. Also it wasn't accompanied with raita.<//Review>

I used to eat here all the time.  Don't order near closing, or take out. I tipped them for takeout (thought I'd be supportive during these times) but I received vindaloo with ZERO potatoes the past 2 times, no regard for what spice level you specify. It's a disappointing decline.<//Review>

Best Indian food in la. Even with perhaps a limited menu the food is fresh, full of flavor and food not over cooked. Spice is correctly gauged as far as no spice, or little spice or super Spice. There are even more levels than that of course but those are the three types I tried so I can know if I’m ordering for guests. The food came quick thru Uber eats. Only thing I would sayas a change would be  that the packaging could be biodegradable</Text>

I didn't have high expectations going in because I've been disappointed by Indian places around LA before but I was super stoked with how well everything came out. If you aren't a fan of spicy food, you may want to ask your server about the level of spice on any meals you order. This place is one of many little gems tucked away in downtown Burbank.</text>

We really wants to give negative rating -5 star it's worst really sucks. We was so hungry we ordered chicken biryani the old girl ask do u want to order raita with it means wow they don't server raita with biryani that's its self weird so we canceled our remaining order and waiting for biryani it's came within 5 min in very small plate and it's look like they  just mixed chicken curry in rice and served. Very bad experience</Review>

Great and tasty food with a big variety of vegetarian options for those that don't eat meat. Food might be a little spicy for those that are not used to Indian food but still very taste with lots of flavor. Decoration is very classic and cozy with low lighting. Plenty of free parking in building behind the restaurant.</review>

This place is ok for food but the worst service ever! The staff is extremely rude and did not provide bowls for curries even after repeated requests. The price $16 for buffet isn’t worth the experience. I hope they realize that they are in hospitality industry and will improve the service.<//Text>< pics>

Fairly decent Indian buffet.  It lacks some of the spice and depth of flavor that you might seek from Indian food, but it is perfectly aligned with the typical american palette.</Text>

Small selection but you can’t go wrong with any of the choices here. I really enjoy their naan. It’s always fresh and hot. The garlic and mint are my go to choices.</Review>

One of my favorite Indian restaurants in LA. Good food and a really reasonably priced buffet. I love that they have chicken tikka masala and samosas every day as part of the buffet. And the buffet is 7 days a week! The Studio City location has a nice outdoor area too.</text>

For tlmy fellow vegan friends, they always have vegan options readily available at the buffet. If they don't have what's you're looking for, inform them you're vegan and they will hook it up.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>Picked up a meal, portions were incredibly small. Also, just no chicken! Rice is an additional cost. This in my opinion is extremely greedy as rice is essential to a goood Indian meal.  Tikki was bland. Korma was bland. Overall, no. So many better options.< /text>< rating>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>The food was good, though not as spicy as I was hoping. They have a very upscale-like interior with a very deep, serene atmosphere. Felt like there should have been some jazz playing in the background and maybe there was... The wait staff check on your frequently and it was a lovely place. I would recommend it for a local Burbank/LA Indian spot, but just don't ask for medium spicy unless you would like it mild... I like things spicy! ;  )<//Review>< pics>

My husband and I got the vegetarian dinner for 2. It came with 2 somoas and salad to share, your choice of 2 vegetarian or vegan dinners from the menu, naan and a dessert to share. It was very filling and the waiter was very nice and helpful. They are very accommodating for Vegans. One of the owners came to talk to us afterward to ask how everything was. He was so nice and cheerful. We will diffently be coming back when we are in the area.</review>

Love this restaurant! Great location, comfortable and beautiful interior, and friendly staff. Most importantly, the food is DELICIOUS! The dinner entree prices are a bit steep, but I highly recommend the lunch buffet! $12.95 (I believe) for amazing quality food, with great vegetarian options. I love the naan and the samosas especially. Definitely recommend! :)</Text>

< review>
Flavor of India is conveniently located in Downtown Burbank. I've never been a fan of Indian food, but since it's been years since I last tried it, I decided to give it a go.

Surprise! Palate was very happy this go around. The garlic naan was incredible. Tandoori chicken was a bit dry, but the sauce was very well done. The butter chicken & tikka masala didn't taste very different to me, but they were both good. The real difference that I could tell was the texture of the sauces. Finally, we also got the vegetable korma, which was my favorite. The food was flavorful and at a good price range, and the service was good. Do keep in mind that I have nothing to compare this experience to, but rather I rate this as an Indian food first timer.

Thank you Flavor of India for awakening my taste buds for Indian food. I'm now aware of a whole cuisine that I have been missing out on.  Great LA local business.</review>

Not friendly. Im not familiar with the food and the waiter was not suggestive. I had to pull teeth to know what is good on the  Menu. Waiter did not offer anything to drink just brought tab water and there was a Bar in the resturant across from me. Bad waiting experience but food did taste good. A little too garlicky but that was fine i like garlic<//Review>

< Review>
Food is DELISOUS staff excellent and besides these important reasons this establishement is very HONEST. A person in our party dropped a twenty dollar bill on our way out and when he relized it was about an hour later. When we went back to ask if someone found a twenty dollar bill they said yes and returned it. 😍 Great food and great people.<//Review>

<Review>The food was good. The waiter was nice. But the server and the rest of the staff was horrible. The place is a little run down which I didn't mind, but the place needs a serious cleaning. The light fixtures  have clumps of dust it's was bad.</Review>< date>

Walked in to hear buffet service ends at 2:30, looked at their menu and everything is around 12 dollars and up. Indian restaurants in this area have it all wrong, and it shows. Both Indian restaurants which are a block away from each other, fully empty at rush hour. This place is super dark and when I walked in there were 3 restaurant workers literally laying down on the booths with their shoes off as if this thing was a hostel. The smell was foul and they have the nerve to ask for these prices LOL laughable. You can cook your own food at home, you come to a restaurant for the experience and for someone else to wash dishes. The experience in this place is similar to going to skid row downtown LA to have a meal, people laying around and foul smell. Didn’t even sit down, I’m sure the food could be good but I would never sit down to eat in this filth. Yuck. Omg wow.</text>

<Review>We've been going to this restaurant since they opened. There's a daily lunch buffet, consisting of salad, rice, a vegetarian dish, tandoori chicken, a meat dish or two, naan, pakoras, and chutney. The food is fresh and delicious. The service is always exemplary. This is one of our go to places for Indian food. It's tucked away, but not hard to find at the bottom of the parking structure.< /Review>< pictures>

Excellent flavor, had the chicken vindaloo, chicken tika masala, and saag paneer. Wish the vindaloo was hotter, but flavor-wise it was one of the best I've had. It wasn't overly vinegary like some places do it.</text>

First ever review of my life and writing because my 2years amd 4 years old kid was crying because of screaming waitresses....can u believe 😲! Horrible Horrible Horrible Horrible the only word to describe....giving 1 star because won't let me write otherwise. Too bad there is no negative star option! They talk terribly and rudely. lady there says "u people  (Indian) always complain and other (non-indian) people never complain 🙄...really u hear this in Indian restaurant...she says " i don't care"....They even don't know they are serving spoiled food....never ever go there to humiliate your self and make yourself sick! BTW speaking of food no where near given 4 star! average food!</Review>

<Text>The owner is the best. He is very friendly and helped with the menu selection. He was kind enough to give free desserts to the kids. A must visit.< /Text>< response>

Good food, very nice decor but the portions have gotten very small where it is no longer good value. There were six of us there, we ordered samosas for appetizer, six entrées naan and rice and all of us left hungry.< /Text>

The worst Indian restaurant in the area. service was awful and they snuck in charge for a dish we didn't order which I had to point out(it could've been easily slip through my attention). Also very over priced for the quality food they had. I've been to many Indian restaurants in the area and I try similar dishes to compare them, and this one by far the most disappointing experience.</review>

Place was almost empty at 5:30 on a Saturday, when we walked in one of the waiters was asleep at one of the tables right when you walk in the door, after being seated we waited for 15 minutes and no one came over to even ask us if we wanted a drink yet one of the waiters was standing in the dining room watching tv. I was pretty surprised at how much the waiters didn't care and even the fact that there is a tv in the dining room shows that this place isn't being ran right. What a joke these guys need to get their act together!<//Review>

The food is not delicious. It didn't taste the way we expected it to be. The food price is quite expensive for the quality and quantity. The fish curry in particular was not good. If you decide to go to an Indian restaurant, search for another place.</text>

Had dinner, Food is OK in taste but quantity wise is less. We took Chicken tikka masala and couldn't finish even one Naag properly.
Maybe lunch buffet would be good option to try for with multiple varieties which we had in Santa Monica in same restaurant brand.</Text>

Great lunch buffet experience, you honestly cannot help but pile on the food on the plate. Vegetarian options are available as well as the classic Tikka Massala. I highly recommend ordering one of their  Naan Breads, my particular favorite is the cheese Naan bread.</review>

< Review>
This restaurant is awesome! It's simple, and maybe a little loud. But probably has the best prices for the highest quality indian food I've had in SF. We enjoyed mango lassis (delicious), vegetable pakoras (great flavor), garlic naan, and chicken tikka masala. Fantastic dining experience, great service, will go on the list a must have for union square area food!</Review>

I had a very bad experience with the order I placed :(.

I ordered Chicken Briyani and got a rice mixed with some chicken masala; when asked, got a response that this is how a Briyani would be and many customers appreciated that. I am not sure who appreciated or whoever appreciated know how a Briyani tastes. They should have told that they do not serve Briyani, I would have gone fro some other GOOD restaurants.
Paid 30 bugs for a mixed rice. Literally disappointed with this!<//review>

<Time>1419405056431<//Time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>This was the worst indian restaurant that i ever visited. The Chef didn't know the difference between Paneer Tikka Masala and Paneer Butter Masala.
We had asked for Spicy Paneer Tikka Masala and the Chef simply added RED CHILLI powder. The food was not tasty at all. Biryani was also very bland. I felt as if Rice was cooked with Potato and Cabbage Curry -- i would NOT recommend this restaurant for Indian food. The hotel & the location is nice but the owner needs to hire a better cook and a good manager :-)<//Text>< Pictures>

Very less options for a lunch buffet. Items like Naan, samosas and pakoras were being very much delayed to be served even though the restaurant was not so busy.<//Review>

It’s first drink in the menus and is called ‘Masala chai’, and we are never out of stock. Please feel free to call us and tell us about your experience to look into this matter directly. We would look into it immediately. But we definitely have Indian tea and we ensure we are fully stocked as it is a common order item.\n\nThank you !'}< /Response></record>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) Good service and delicious food, average price per set is $ 16. yes ... everything is separately, that is to say that in this type of restaurant you will never find a complete meal on a set, you have to order the rice separately, the bread separately and so on.
It may be a bit more expensive than other places, but it's worth roughly $ 50- $ 60 for 2 people. This type of service is ideal for sharing, you order several dishes and everyone at the table shares.

(Original)
Buen servicio y comida deliciosa, precio promedio por plató es de $16 dólares. eso sí...  todo es por separado, es decir que en este tipo de restaurante nunca vas a encontrar una comida completa en un plató, tienes que ordenar el arroz por separado el pan por separado y así.
puede ser un poquito más caro que otros lugares Pero vale la pena aproximadamente entre unos $50 Y $60 por 2 personas. Este tipo de servicios es ideal para compartir, ordenas varios platos y todos en la mesa comparten.< /Review><gmapID>0x80c295508f572517:0xdc916891dd702b12</gmapID>< userid>

<Pics>None</Pics><Name>Dori Kesta<//Name><Text>(Translated by Google) I love this place, the food is very good, the staff friendly and available.
There is a good variety of choices on the map, also drinkable.
The taste is authentic and you can even choose the degree of chilli of your dish (for those who, like me, avoids spicy dishes)
Tip: when coming to many, choose a dish and share to discover the menu!
A good place to keep!

(Original)
J'adore cet endroit, la nourriture est tres bonne, le personnel sympathique et disponible.
Il y a une bonne variete de choix sur la carte, en boisson egalement.
Le gout est authentique et vous pouvez meme choisir le degre de piment de votre plat (pour ceux qui, comme moi evite les plats epices)
Conseil : en venant a plusieurs, choisissez chacun un plat puis partager afin de decouvrir le menu !
Une bonne adresse a garder !< /Text><Date>1453672006235< /Date><gmap_id>0x80c295508f572517:0xdc916891dd702b12< /gmap_id>< Response>
