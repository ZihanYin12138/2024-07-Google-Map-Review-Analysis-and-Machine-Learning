I visited this business and was very pleased with their services. I had my hair ruined at a barber locally and came here to get my hair fixed. I told the lady what occurred and she was understanding of the situation. The lady was friendly, kind, and provided quality services. She fixed my hair and made it look good. I was very happy and walked away satisfied.

I recommend visiting this location!<//Text>

The staff was helpful and thorough. A little pricey, but they definitely took their time and made it worth the trip to get cleaned up. Would recommend it if you need a haircut on the fly. Online check-in was easy and convenient.<//review>

Always seen within 5 minutes. I like the online and phone scheduling. Stylists are professional, efficient, and friendly. Masks are required and worn, making it a safe place even if you haven't had your Covid vaccine yet.
Get a haircut and shampoo. You deserve it.<//Text>

<text>One of the best places for certain styles.  They cut my daughter's hair in a bob. Not everyone knows how to do that style. It's not as easy a cut as you'd think.  My daughter still looks like a little girl and the cut was quality.  My other daughter also ended going to a Barber because of how well they can cut certain styles.  Barbers are really experienced hair stylists. But to mention all the other amenities at a barber.  As long as my daughter continues to want shorty hair we will continue to go to a barber<//text><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

I wanted to tell her the way I rate a barber/beautician is how much I have to fix my own hair AFTER I get home. Laura is awesome as I did not have to fix ONE IOTA on my hair. I will DEFINITELY be returning in 2-3 weeks as I will be making the drive from Spring Valley to Eastlake as my usual shop is in Rancho SD...

<Response>None< /Response><time>1600031645620</time><review>We went and checked in, in person and people kept popping up after us that checked in online. They obviously checked in before they got there because it was just us who physically checked in but the staff just kept pulling them in front of us. The point of checking in online is doing it when you arrive and not having to wait for someone to stop cutting and come to the front counter. It is not a VIP pass to cut other people in line when you were not present. Very rude staff, all women. Normally go to a man's barbershop because they follow the first come, first serve etiquette. Won't be returning to this location in the future. The one in Visalia, CA is not like this one in any way.<//review>< userid>

I used the SC app for the first time and it was extremely easy and convenient!  Once I arrived at the site, they checked me in at the kiosk and a few minutes later Chastine was giving me my haircut.  She was very friendly and professional and has adapted to the outdoors setup like a true pro!</Text>

I signed up on line and was put on the waiting list.  I was seen within 5 minutes of the estimated time. The stylist was very friendly and professional and gave me the current I asked for.  The shop was very responsible in following the new directives and yet somehow managed to make you feel like it was business as usual.  Which was a nice change.<//text>

The hairdressers were very polite.  However, the one who assisted my son, a minor, caused minor cuts on the back of my son’s neck. And she did not cut the back round, as I requested.< /Text>

<Text>I have been here several times over the past few months and have loved the great service and the hospitality.  Sports Clips offers and variety of services outside of a standard haircut, but I normally just stop in every two weeks for a trim.  I cannot recommend this Spots Clip location enough.  They do a grab job each time I visit and run a very professional shop.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

All was great for my 1st time at sport clips, since all other places were closed.  Only issue was pricing online was lower than what I was charged; got charged $24 for a varsity cut, same for a MVP.</text>

<Review>A very good experience but a bit steep for price. As a military service member, I can get a regulation haircut for $9. I only decided to pay $21 (with discount) plus tip because It was my last day in town and couldn’t afford the time to drive to the base. So service members, I suggest going to a base to save more. If the discounted price for a regulation haircut was about $17-18 I would feel it would be a more fair price and increase service member participation.< /Review>< Date>

I travel alot. I'm a senior and a veteran. I always get the discount as a veteran and being a senior. Which comes out to be $15.00.
Your barber said the owner will allow that. So I got the senior rate only. I will not be back to your location.

First time getting my haircut since I moved here from Oklahoma and it was probably the best haircut I've had in my life. I'm horrible with names but she has blonde hair and is very cool and outgoing. Had a great conversation that didn't feel forced. She knew what she was doing and cut my hair perfectly. The product she used worked well with my hair unlike a lot of other products people have tried on me. I went to only Sports Clips in Oklahoma but never were they as good as my experience here. 10 out of 10 would recommend giving it a try if your still getting a generic cut at (won't name drop) Duper Cuts. I was there for years and never knew what a good cut was til now!</Text>

The timing worked out for me, as I went mid-day on a Thursday. I checked in via the app, arrived within 10 minutes, and was seen right away. The offerings of services here are the same as what I'm used to at Scripps Poway. There's certainly more room to roam about for the stylists. The MVP experience went well. My stylist checked on the heat level of the towel before the wash.

The location being on the second floor is new to me, but it's accessible by both stairs and elevator.

I had a pleasant experience, overall. I'd get my cut there again, should I visit the area, down the road.< /Review>

I got the haircut exactly what I wanted. The Stylist I had knew what she was doing, and even was able to know what I was looking for, without me fully knowing what it was that I wanted. They took GREAT care of me! Highly recommended!<//Review>

My son had an amazing haircut.  The experience was top notch.  We even went back the next day to buy the hair product the stylist used on him to style his hair.  Love it.< /Text>

My son and I followed Jessica from another store in our home area because we know her professionalism and positive attitude make for a great experience. We will gladly travel outside of our home area for that type of person. Thank you Jessica, Brayden and I appreciate you!<//Text>

<Review>Susie was great and the haircuts are great for what you pay for. The location of the place is a good place unless you don't like the hike up the stairs. Overall the experience is one that anyone will like especially to catch up on espn highlights and live sports.</Review>< Pictures>

I want to give this place 3.5 stars, but that isn't an option. Service was good. One of the ladies, possible the owner are part owner didn't seem very welcoming. She was all business. The biggest problem with Sports Clips is they try to upsell on an already $22 dollar hair cut. Come on now, Men's hair is not hard to cut to complicated to style. I would say on average they could turn around a customer in 15-minutes or less.  I will probably be shopping around.< /text>

Very friendly, clean and efficient. But then I don't have much hair left.  Just one annoyance; I wish they would stop yelling, "Welcome to Sports Clips" as if it were a contest whenever anyone walks in the door. One cheery welcome from ONE person would be sufficient.<//text>

I had a molar removed and implant placed with absolutely no complications. The staff is very helpful and appointments are prompt, I did not experience waiting. Dr Wilson is very skilled and took great care during my procedures. He also was sweet enough to check in late in the day after my morning procedure to see how I was doing. Recommend highly if you want great results.< /review>< Pics>

Called 6 times to make a appointment with Dr. Wilson. First call with front desk said would call right back with scheduled date. Did not call back. Called second time front desk said needed to get with office MGR. before scheduling said would call end of day or tomorrow(Friday). No call back. Called on Friday . Recording said they were closed. Called Monday front desk said didn't anybody call you on Friday and I said no you were closed. She said they were open but did not remember our conversations on Thursday(why would you say didn't they call you when you don't know the conversation is about. You were the one to convey the conversation). I asked to speak to the MGR and the MGR said they were closed and would call me back with a appointment date. MGR called me back to say Dr. Wilson does not give second opinions on dental work due to legal matters that can occur. She said to find someone else. This office wasted 5 days of my time . Unbelievable!<//Text>

Dr. Wilson and his staff have great bedside manner. I have had several negative previous experiences with dentists and oral surgeons and they made me feel really comfortable. They were also able to fit me in for an emergency. I appreciate everyone in this office and their professionalism !< /text>

<text>I WAS NOT SURE WHICH OF MY TEETH WAS TO BE EXTRACTED.  SINCE WE WERE AT AN IMPASSE, I DECIDED IT WAS BETTER FOR ME TO CHECK WITH MY DENTIST TO BE CERTAIN.  I REGRET THAT I DID NOT HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY THAT BEFORE THE NUMBING BEGAN.   I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE I WSA WEARING MY MOUTH GUARD FOR 2 NIGHTS PREVIOUS, MY TEETH (TOOTH) WAS NOT SORE.   YOUR OFFICE DID NOTHING WRONG. AND I APPRECIATED DR SLAUGHTER'S PATIENCE!<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Greatly successful pre & post meetings. Successful surgery. Clear communication. Doctor Wilson has GREAT bedside manner, the nurses were very considerate... I never felt rushed, like they were trying to move on to the next patient.

The only issue was the lack of communication with my spouse as she was waiting for my surgery to be done. She had several work-related things that she could have completed in the neighborhood or even from her car (she works remotely) had she been given updates for how much longer the surgery will take. Just communicating updates as the time changes would go a long way.</Review>< Pictures>

Staff was great, provided excellent customer service. My only complaint is during the initial call I asked would they call me ahead of time to let me know if the services I requested was not covered by my insurance and the lady said yes. Of course as I'm  checking out, a staff member reviews the services/costs, turns out my insurance doesn't cover any of it. Wasn't too happy about that.< /text>

Very attentive staff.  I must thank Dr. Wilson for calling me at home the evening after my procedure to see if I was doing well.  I also want to thank Christine at the AG office for greeting people so cheerfully and for remembering my name.<//Review>

Dr. Wilson allowed me to be participant in the process of treating my tooth extraction plan.  I liked the way he explained so much to me of the difficulties and the procedure. The root of the tooth goes into my left sinus.  Prolia has to ahve been given 6 months before to prevent prolonged bleeding.  Thanks.< /Text>

< review>
About 10 months ago I had to make one of the biggest hardest to decide decisions of my life... I needed complete dentures, and at the age of 82 I really didn't know if I was ready to make a huge commitment like that.... Pain????  money???? permanent relief and ability to eat normally ???   All major questions... With wonderful loving advice from family and consultations with Dr. Slaughter, I felt comfortable and confident with the decision to invest in myself and my comfort... It has been 10 months and I can honestly say it was an easy journey.... Dr. Slaughter and his staff were so calm, reassuring, and there anytime I had a question during the aftercare...They simply did not allow me to be apprehensive...I am now 100% confident with my dentures, no more pain from bad bad teeth, and I cannot tell the difference in my dentures and how my real teeth used to feel... I am eating normally, (even corn on the cob)....So I highly recommend this pleasant professional office...

I am grateful for the excellent medical treatment I received from Dr. Wilson for my fractured mandible.  This is a first class doctor's office.  The staff is friendly as is Dr. Wilson.  I recommend anyone who needs an oral surgeon to see Dr. Wilson.

DO NOT USE DOCTOR SLAUGHTER. I AM STILL SUFFERING FROM HIS MISTAKE.

I got my wisdom teeth extracted by Doctor Slaughter in late July of summer 2016. It is now March 2017, and I just had my second surgery to fix things that could have avoided in the first place if he did the surgery right. A week after I had my wisdom teeth taken out, I got an infection so I was put on a small dose of antibiotic by Slaughter. A week or so later I had finished the antibiotic and left the country for a vacation. My first night in Belize, I woke up and the infection had gotten very bad. That morning I went to a doctor in the nearest town and he had to squeeze the infection out with his hands because it was so bad. He then put me on a stronger antibiotic (what Slaughter should have put me on in the first place) and it killed most of the infection. When I got back home, I went back to Slaughter and he found a piece of dead bone that he left in. He thought nothing of it.

Fast forward to 8 months later and I am still having severe pain. I went into an oral surgeons office a couple weeks ago and he said from the looks of it, there was still an infection. Yesterday, March 24th I had a biopsy and they found a piece of root from my wisdom tooth that had been left in there!!! It was causing a serious infection to where my bone was very soft and mushy.

3 surgeries when this could have been avoided if done correctly. Doctor Slaughter is definitely not a good option if you are looking for an oral surgeon.</text>

I hope Dr. WILSON and his staff read this !!!!

I think Dr. WILSON is one of the best doctors/dentists who has ever treated me in my entire lifetime and I will b 66 on 11/11/2018. U can tell he really cares about his patients cuz he asks how I am feeling & actually waits & listens to my response all the while he looks me in the eyes. He does not act so busy as if I am wasting his precious time. I happen to know that this is quite rare for medical professionals these days because approx. 2 weeks after my oral surgery w/ Wilson I had another surgery & this surgeon moved, talked & reacted so quickly that it made me nervous & uncomfortable & scared. This surgeon had a much larger support team but somehow I felt like I was just another patient in a long line of scheduled surgeries. Dr. Wilson called me himself and also one of his staff following my procedure to "check in on me ". WOW ! THAT IS A VERY KIND & CONSIDERATE THING TO DO. OF COARSE NO PHONE CALL FROM THE OTHER SURGEON NOR ANY OF HIS STAFF. The pre-op instructions from the other surgeon included 4 simple things: 1. Hav responsible adult pick up after surgery. 2. Wear short sleeves & comfortable clothing. 3. Bring pillow to elevate arm following surgery. 4. Directions to surgicenter (map & written directions) which I found most helpful. But nothing about not eating/drinking b4 procedure which I knew I had to do from Dr. WILSON'S PRE-OP INSTRUCTIONS. I TOLD THE RECEPTIONIST AT THE OTHER OFFICE THAT PRE-OP INSTRUCTIONS WERE MINIMAL & SHE SAID MANY PATIENTS TELL HER THAT. HELLO ? THEN WHY NOT CHANGE THEM. WHEN I WENT IN FOR THE SURGERY THEY ASKED ME WHEN IT WAS THAT I last ate. What wld hav happened if I said 3 hours ago? SHEEZ!!! And the final thing Dr. WILSON DID WHICH I really appreciated was explain all of my options. Now how many times has a physician/dentist done this for you ? Very knowledgeable, organized, positive and great sense of humor-all things that helped me feel relaxed and comfortable. And his staff fills in just where needed. I highly recommend Dr. WILSON to anyone requiring oral surgery. I NEVER KNEW I CLD MAIL MY FILLINGS & RECEIVE CASH. AND I HAV HAD MANY MANY MANY FILLINGS THROUGHOUT MY LIFETIME. THAT WAS A BONUS BONUS BONUS. IT FELT LIKE I HIT THE JACKPOT. THANKS DOCTOR & TEAM! I REALLY APPRECIATE HOW COMFORTABLE YOU MADE ME FEEL.< /text>

Outstanding in all categories. Wish Dr. Slaughter could be my dentist for all of my dental requirements and not just surgery.  I have always been a "coward" when when it comes to a dentist, but not with Dr. Slaughter.<//text>

< Review>
The Asian meatballs were very disappointing. I think they are a limited-time item and I couldn't be happier. The meatballs were small, hard, and overcooked. I wasn't a fan of the sauce either. This location is next to a Starbucks so trying to get parking and get out of your parking space is an issue due to the Starbucks drive-thru. The restaurant was clean and their staff was friendly. The beef bowl was wonderful.<//Review>

Very fresh and delicious food. I love ordering the original beef and teriyaki chicken combo plate with veggies and rice 👍 I always get a great deal with the coupons they send through the mail ☺️ Friendly and very helpful staff</Text>

<review>MM its really yummy gyuudon but NO BENISHOGA!!!
if you are really smart you can buy the yoshinoya frozen packs at a japanese specialty store and make it at home! it tastes much better AND IS MUCH CHEAPER than going to these actual chain outlets. yoshinoya in japan actually is really struggling recently simply because it has TOO many chain locations in japan, i wonder what will happen in california!!! either way i will come agaiN!!!< /review><response>None</response><Date>1599112211020< /Date><gmapID>0x80c29c9ad122fe0f:0x7dd9a01b1edc52ae</gmapID><pics>None</pics>< user_id>

It was a good place to eat prior to the remodel! Decent amount of food for the price. However, anyone noticed the quantity is being cut down to at least 1/3 compare to previous owner !</text>

I was here on Saturday afternoon, around 130pm, only 3 customers in front of me, took more than 15mins before I got my regular bowl, even that I had to go to the counter to ask for my food as the people after me already gotten theirs. Not sure why they are so slow, it's not like they cook to order<//review></record>

<Review>A STAPLER PIN in my food??????? I can't even imagine this!!! Is it a joke?? really?? who does run this place?????? it's not like piece of hair, it can KILL you!!!!! at the begining I thought it's just some vegetable then I found out it's too thick and hard. Story wasn't finished there and funny is that when I went to counter and I ask can you describe why it is in my food, the cashier looked at me and said mmm idk! do you want another one? it looked like it's a normal matter in their kitchen.

IF YOU LIKE YOUR LIFE NEVER EVER GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) A terrible place where they do not know how to take a take out order and do it correctly
The orders are never prepared well, something is always missing or they give you something that you did not fill and in the end the managers are rude since they do not know how to take a claim, they only want one to leave so as not to stain the name of the company and in the end how always "the customer is to blame" and why because as they told me "that's why check your order"

(Original)
Un pesimo lugar donde no saben tomar una orden para llevar y hacerlo correctamente
Las ordenes nunca las preparan bien siempre falta algo o te dan algo que tu no padiste y al final las los encargados  son groseros  ya que no saben  tomar un reclamo  solo quieren que uno se salga  para no manchar el nombre de la empresa  y al final como siempre " el cliente tiene la culpa " y por que  por que como me dijeron "por eso cheque su orden"<//text>

Disappointed. Employee is not wearing mask at all but talk talk talk while loading the foods. That's gross. Very rude and discourteous, bad customer service. As long as being a manager, it does not mean that she can act as if she doesn't care about the customers.
Also guys, the price is hell good but you know you get what you pay for. Spend extra $1 or $2 but the food will be of better quality.</Text>

Hands down the best place to get produce at great prices. Love the fact that the Store is very community oriented too.

I wish I could give them 100 stars. My family has been shopping here since before I was born. I follow the tradition and drive here weekly from Pasadena because no other store can beat their prices and fresh quality. Family owned. I see the same friendly faces from when my grandma would bring me with her when I was a little girl. You won’t regret stopping by. You’ll be shocked at how much chain grocery stores rip you off after you shop here.< /review>

EMPLOYEE'S NOT WEARING MASKS! Worst of all, one of the owners, who wasn't wearing a mask, ACTUALLY coughed right in front of me, basically in my face and they where handling the food. No gloves or anything! He was placing produce, coughed right in front of me, continued placing produce after coughing on it, and then without washing his hands or anything, went to the checkout to help customers. Dissapointing for sure.< /review>

<Text>The best produce store around. The prices are low! But most important the store is clean.
you can get in and out very quickly also. At times you can find produce you cant find at super market.

They run out of the mint leaves so I was thinking they didn't had any. So I pick other vegetables since they have very good prices but I still ask one of the gentleman that was working there if they had any and he said Yes but he check in the front where there were supposed to be And I guess they run out since it was close to 5pm but he went right away to the back to grab me a bunch very green very fresh..  all I can say that their prices are very good And their products are very fresh. They closed Sundays and Mondays but they are open all the other days in till 6pm Saturday in till 5pm. I can't remember I what time they told me they were open but it was super early I believe it was 6 a.m. in the morning or 9 not sure. Anyway mi Gente I do recommend it 💕</review><user_name>Ana Cuevas (AnaCuevas)</user_name>< UserId.>

<Response>None<//Response><review>My best friend has been raving about this produce market for a long time and I finally got the go there with him today. It's a wonderful throwback to when produce was fresh and packaged on the premises. there's a huge selection of produce and fruit. They also have a cold section with great selection of cheeses and other dairy products. They have pre-packaged dollar bags of fruits and vegetables which are a great bargain. I saw the prices were about half of what you pay in one of the big supermarkets in Los Angeles. They also have bulk selection of spices, beans, dried fruit, and pantry Staples. It's far from where I live but I plan on coming back again.<//review>< Name>

Not everything is labeled with the name, so you need to be somewhat familiar with produce. Prices are great and the person working there was friendly and helpful. Limited parking. Also produce bags only available in a few spots in the store.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2d9f95dee3b9f:0x681c9217516f734d</gmapID></record>

Good prices. Closed Sunday and Monday. Most vegetables are one dollar. You have to go and see for yourself. For 10.00 you can purchase so many vegetables.< /review>

The prices there are a little lower, the selection is a little more limited, but it's a solid location to drop by if you need some vegetables or fruit for the night.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2d9f95dee3b9f:0x681c9217516f734d</GmapID></record>

<Text>I enjoyed my time at Tower Yoga and hope to be back very soon! I could take Jameson’s class 1000 times and I believe it would be equally as profound as the first; and I love they offer classes in Spanish, I hope to take one soon! If you have the opportunity to take any class at Tower yoga you won’t be disappointed, I’m sure!</Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I was just talking about this place with my partner recently and we were saying how much we love and miss tower yoga. We moved away and realised how much we took them for granted! They are 100% under rated. Kellee and Jameson are honestly the best yoga instructors I have ever met. Their cueing is on point. They’re exceptional human beings all around. And I realised that I think I love Kellees teaching so much because she instructs in a trauma informed way. I can’t even explain it well enough. Some yoga studios are not like that at all. I think her teaching style is a major contributor to my ability to open up and make a significant amount of emotional progress. So much healing was initiated from being around them, and the community they created!< /Review>

I have been going to tower yoga since they opened a year ago and I am in love. I go every chance I get( which is sometimes twice a day). If you download the tower yoga app you can see all of the classes available and your first week is free. There are a variety of classes and definitely something for everyone! Not only can you get in great shape but even better is the mental clarity and strength as well as peace!❤️❤️❤️<//text>< rate>

This place is so welcoming for beginners and beyond. Super clean and inviting space with fully stocked showers for after hot yoga class. All the instructors fully explain each movement and offer variants of positions for different levels of yogis. Staff are super helpful and nice. The classes are always exactly what I needed mentally and physically. Plus, they offer a wide range of classes from vinyasas to power or sculpt type yoga classes and more!
It’s an amazing studio!<//Review>

The staff was extremely friendly and I love the environment. The instructor for the class (Jameson) made me feel extremely welcomed. I’ve never done yoga before and I was lowkey a little nervous but that went away after being so welcomed by the staff. They really encourage you to go at your own pace which is awesome. Highly recommend for any experience level.< /review>

Very friendly environment. This space is dedicated for being well and personal growth. I am a beginner and I first came with a friend just to get more in tune with my body. Every time I leave, I always feel more relaxed and loosened. It is really nice to be in such a welcoming  environment.< /text>

< review>
This is my first week along with my daughter and we have been so impressed!  Tower Yoga has such a great vibe!  Starting with Jamison who signed us up and then let my other daughter have a trial run.  The facility itself is amazing from offering free face towels to all the supplies provided in the bathroom. Tower Yoga IS all about connectedness and building community. Because of all the accolades and raves we speak about Tower Yoga now my oldest daughter wants to join too!  This is my first yoga membership after trying other programs and just after a week I know this is something I need for my mental health and will continue. The instructors are amazing and passionate about what they do.  Today during the 11am class was especially difficult for me because we buried my best friend's father who was also my godfather.  I broke down and cried as I was leaving and Crystal was so kind and talked to me with such compassion that my feelings of embarrassment quickly dissolved and I embraced my tears. Crystal talked about how that self awareness is healing and happens with yoga.   When she said "cry it out sista" I knew she meant it.  I am very grateful to share how much I appreciate Tower Yoga and all the people who make it a welcoming and peaceful place.  Thank you for asking!<//review>

I have always wanted to take a hot yoga class but never had the courage. I felt comfortable that the class was beginner hot yoga class and I'm so glad I tried it out! I appreciated Kelly's positive and kind energy, and that the class was at a pace comfortable for a newbie to hot yoga. AND $6 community classes!</Review>

Love all the yoga selections that are offered, hot vinyasa, power yoga, and yoga sculpt are my favorites. The instructors and the instruction is great, but what I like most of all is the atmosphere of the studio, they help everyone to feel welcomed and included in all aspects of the practice.</text>

My husband and I have taken a few classes at Tower Yoga and holy smokes we were blown away by the LOVE everyone has!  That's the best way I can describe the place, filled with love.  The teachers are extremely passionate and knowledgeable and they make you feel comfortable getting outside of your comfort zone, if that makes sense haha.  We took our first acro yoga class just the other night.  We arrived feeling anxious and unsure, and we left feeling supported and proud for trying something new.  10/10 recommend anyone to give this place a go!</text>

<Name>AL< /Name><date>1548909455170</date><Text>Becoming kid friendly...The types of classes offered are great; their Buti Yoga is different from the traditional yoga and has more beats and exercises. The ambiance is refreshing/natural and super neat, their bathroom is clean and offers free natural products to use. The instructors end the class beautifully with reflections for ourselves... However, in December it wasn't really good. I arrived with two kids (8&6) who were just going to sit and play on their tablets while I went into a class,  but I was told "Sorry we don't have a day care system" and I had to leave. I eventually got a response from James (one of the owners) and he was truly concerned to learn about what had happened. He and some instructors are always working towards making it a welcoming space and you can truly feel a part of Tower Yoga, instead of just another body in the room. 👍🏼< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1540345742733, 'text': 'HI Alice, thank you for your thoughtful words.

I'm so so so excited to finally get to try Surf and Soul! Their Instagram feed full of food pictures has been drawing me in! I called in my order and picked up popcorn shrimp and grits and a piece of pound cake. The shrimp and grits are soooo good, highly recommend! I can't wait to try other dishes! Everything looks amazing!!</review>

<review>Go early because the line starts to form fast.  The food here is hot and fresh and tastes amazing. We ate the fried pork chops, crispy fried catfish, and golden fried whole chicken wings. Our sides were baked mac and cheese, smoked turkey collard greens, and sweet candied yams. My husband and I loved every bite. Nothing is greasy, everything is crispy and scrumptious 😋. Will definitely go again.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Wow wow wow wow!!!! BOW DOWN to the Kings of the South Soul FOOD!!! YAS LORDT!!!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 this gotta be the best food in San Diego. Every. Single. Thing. Was, AMAZING!!! Got the fried chicken, catfish, greens, yams Mac n cheese red beans and rice. Whewwww everything I just listed I recommend. Good flavor,
Cooked literally perfect!!! I could cry!! Then they had the nerve to put in some crusty, peach cobbler that was amazing. So good , just soo good!!!

Only complaints: the cornbread isn’t that good (but u don’t need it) , no parking really and be prepared to wait. (About an hour) But let me tell u it’s worth the wait!!!

I CANNOT wait to get back!!!< /review>< Pictures>

My partner and I love Surf and Soul Spot! We’re lucky enough to live in the neighborhood, so we eat here ~once per month and the quality *never* misses! The lemonades and desserts are always changing and they always compliment the rich, flavorful soul food so well! My favorite days are the ‘soul’ days. The fried chicken is good, but the pork chops and the catfish are BOMB. The red beans and rice are great! I highly recommend showing your support for this amazing small business!< /text>

Had the chicken sandwich. It was bomb af. I feel like the prices are cheap for the quality of food. Order ahead, be prepared to wait, and potential not get what you want. They can sell out early. It's worth it though.</Text>

This spot is legit. Order ahead, it’s all cooked to order, and takes a bit of time. We’ve had the fried chop and wings so far. All the sides are solid.<//text>

We ordered pork chops and cat fish with rice and turkey dressing, greens, and sweet potatoes. The pork chops were tough but well seasoned. The fish was tasty with two large, well seasoned pieces.

The sides weren't worth ordering but were included in the meal. They taste like soul food for the novice. This is said having a husband from Louisiana. Overall, it was a great attempt and the novice may really enjoy it.</review>

<Review>Today was my first time ordering here. The lady on the phone was such a sweetheart as I rambled off my order of a $16 plate w/wings, Mac n cheese and yams...then added greens, lemonade and banana pudding that I’d read about. She took my credit card over the phone. My food was ready when I got there. Everyone was so pleasant. My tab of $28 seemed pricey but when I got home and saw the portion size... easily a filling meal for two without the extras. So fresh and delicious that I had to stop myself from eating just to eat. I’m even writing this review so late because I needed a nap after stuffing myself. Great food and portioning for the price. I’ll definitely be going back!< /Review>< Pics>

Whose Granny is cooking back there?! This food is good. Perfectly seasoned. Not too salty like some fish & chicken places. A Very Good Value! We get 2 dinners on Friday and always have enough left over for a second meal. The free pound cake that comes with Friday's meal is delicious. Also, the service is very good. We tip them always for their courteous efficient service. Keep up the good work S&SS!< /Review>

I've been here for the "Surf" days: Monday and Tuesday. The catfish sandwich is superb. Everything is cooked to order. Call in first with credit card if you're too impatient to wait. It's worth going out of your way to come here. Just take it home and eat right away! You want it hot and fresh.<//review>

Food is hot, fresh & delicious.
Food packaging is professional.  Parking is horrible. And be prepared to wait 20plus minutes, if you didn't call it in.</review>

This is a small place, really only takeout even before the pandemic. I had the dinner basket with chicken wings. Wings were great and made to order, and the fries were awesome. Make sure you call ahead as it will take 20 minutes and there's nowhere to wait.< /text>

SO delicious!!! We picked up and on the drive home the smell of the food was irresistible. Super generous too. We ordered the fried shrimp and grits. Also the Fish Hook sandwich. Both dishes were winners.</Review>

I love this place SOOO MUCH. I've had the fish hook sandwich, the basket and the shrimp + grits. Always ask about the lemonade of the day! The catfish is juicy with such an amazing, crispy coating and perfectly seasoned, grits are just the way I like it (with just a tiny bite/crunch to it, not TOO THICK) Seriously everything tastes GREAT here and service is amazing. They're only open Mon-Wed and the wait can be long sometimes but trust me, it's worth it.<//text>

There are 2 things keeping me from giving 5 stars (and I really am going back and forth on the last star just because the owner was so nice). But, first they don't serve plain old tap water like the vast majority of restaurants, fast food joints; almost anywhere you go you can ask for a cup of water but not here. Also the cashier did not seem fit for a customer service job (this is my personal opinion as someone who has worked in customer service for many years, everyone else seemed generally happy and filled with love and good vibes but she seemed a little sour. Idk if she was having a bad day or just isn't really a ray of sunshine, either way, it rubbed me wrong). Overall the look and feel of the place is so cool. A hole in the wall, small restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. The prices are a little steep but that was expected. The food was full of so much flavor though that it was definitely worth the price. I'd go back.<//text></record>

<Review>Bomb y'all.  I had the catfish plate, with rice (I love me some rice) and mac n cheese.  It was great, taste and the quality of food - A+
I will definitely be coming back.
The staff was nice, warm and receptive.  The cook even came out and chatted for a min.  The experience was very good overall.

I'll update when I try some other plates.</Review>< Pictures>

Today was my first time visiting here arrive at 12:53 so of course I had to wait in line until they open up I did order the catfish collard greens and yams with additional side of mac & cheese yams were pretty good collard greens was just OK the fish was the bomb, but the mac & cheese  smell and taste sour there’s no way I’m eating this 🤮🤮 I’m so mad I wasted my money especially on ordering a additional side of it I’m not sure what’s wrong with it or how it is sour but it definitely is It taste like it has been sitting out</Review>

They also make some of the best candied yams I’ve tasted (and I make good ones myself!).  I also highly recommend the macaroni and cheese and the lobster rolls served only during the week.  Get there early as parking is a nightmare, but the food is on POINT!!!<//review>< pics>

<Review>I called to see if they were opened bad phone reception and the female l spoke to was very RUDE. And when l got there they have no parking and l wanted fried chicken wings they didn't have mac &cheese or greens just French fries. And the wait was 20 minutes and the price was $16. Outrageous for 3 whole wings and fries where do they think they're at Lajolla?. I cancelled my order ridiculous .They should be supporting the neighborhood not robbing them!!< /Review><userid>110697669737037352317<//userid><Date>1585694190766</Date>< user_name>

Came back 2x in less than 4 days. Yes it's that GOOD. I'm a go back with my hydro flask and ask them to fill it to the top with lemonade. Fried chicken, skkrrimps (yeah I said it) like  grandma used to make. Imma go back again tomorrow. First reason I had advise you to.visit La Mesa.

<review>They are constantly late! They used to open at 8:30,changed their hours to 9, and still can't manage to open on time. If you need to use it don't plan of coming in the am, you will be sorley disappointed. Get better employees that are on time!<//review>< pics>

No wonder this UPS Gilroy branch gets bad reviews. It says opens at 9:00 AM and there’s nobody here to open the door. I gave it a good five minutes and called the store - no answer, voicemail full. It’s 9:30 AM and still no employee or manager. This branch needs to improve!< /Text>

They offer P.O. Boxes, notary service as well as the standard service’s that UPS stores offer.
The lady in this store was very nice and took her time to help all her customers with out rushing “good job” she helped pops get a letter notarized and was very understanding in helping him get it done.< /review>< pics>

<Text>This store has hours posted outside opening at 8:30am and online. This store is NEVER opened on time. It’s 8:40 and still not open. This is the second time I get here early and its still not open on time. Their answering voicemail doesn’t give any updated opening times either.

Worst place ever , left a package on Tuesday today it’s Sunday and they still haven’t shipped the package yet, if I was UPS I’ll close the store immediately this is just creating bad reputation for UPS.</Review>

I called ahead describing  what size box I needed to mail ASAP. When I arrived the clerk (Brenda?) had found the perfect size, filled the box with the baby shower clothing, taped it up, addressed it, explaining everything.

I normally read lips due to hearing loss but with her Covid mask that was impossible, so she spoke louder at my request.

I received great customer service. I told her that her store had been flamed on line.

It's not an employee's fault that there is a long line. I lucked out, walking right up, attended to in <5 minutes.
Try the Gilroy Post Office if you babies want to really cry.<//Text>

I have been renting mailbox here for almost 3 yrs. Good service good people always willing to help. I've had my mail sorted and sent to my winter address out of state and never a problem or attitude. I've been late on payment for almost 2 months and never a problem. They go above and beyond not only the owner but all the staff. I'm grateful  to have my mail well cared for and sent to me when I ask. Their printing service and computer use service all services I've used have been great. We need more businesses such as this one in Gilroy< /text>

This is the worst ups store. Literally the slowest and least able people work here. They have found the most incompetent people and hired them. I came to simply drop off an amazon return and two employees are present, a quick scan of the bar code and I should be off.

Not here friends! Slow employee number one is taking two customers ahead of me while world slowest dinosaur employee is walking around the store doing god knows what.

What the actual F???

Scan and go people. Scan and go.

Avoid this unless you want to rip your hair out.<//Text>

<text>I dropped off my mountain bike today (I had never shipped it, and I had anxiety about sending it, and packing/labeling it correctly as it's very important to me), and everyone at this store could not have been nicer! Not only did they reassure me that all would be well - as I hovered around them and my bike - they were so sweet in wishing me well on my trip and my bike race (even got a fist bump). It's things like this, when someone is having a stressful day, that just can make someone's day. Thank you so much! I appreciate you guys. :)< /text>< pictures>

Your deliveryman are THE WORST. He gave the name Mario and honestly if I could choose  to pick any other delivery I would because he is the WORST. He always says no one is there to pick up but I'm here!!!! He needs to be fired. Had to go to the store in San Jose to pick up my packages because he would not wait 5 seconds.< /review>

Friendly service and do not even have to write the address just show them the screenshot and they'll ask you to double check the address and then they'll tell you the appx time it'll get there and tell you the charges pretty efficient.< /review>

International shipments requires many forms to fill so every so often you are right we have a line but believe me we want to make sure that we minimize your time (that helps us two ways: 1 You the customer is happy and 2 We have more revenue ).

I had a next day envelope that I dropped off at 3:00pm.  They were busy and the lady said all outgoing go in the pile on the left.  I mentioned that mine was overnight, but she cut me off asking if I was picking up, When I answered no, she repeated herself saying all outgoing going go in the pile.  I put my package in the pile.  The next day i checked for the tracking number to no avail, and called.  Because it was not dropped off in time (5:30pm)  it would not be shipped until the next day.  I informed her that I dropped it off at 2:30 and put it in the pile as instructed.  She then said that i should have told them that my package was overnight because it did not belong in that pile.  Now my package will not be delivered until the following day!  There are many "should have's" this story.  I am definitely culpable, yet I will not be returning to this facility!<//text>

< Review>
The clerks in this store are amazing. I had an error on my bank statement that mistakenly identified the UPS store as making an error with a transaction. I was terribly upset and critical of the store and clerks. Fortunately, they were kind, patient, and incredibly understanding in helping me resolve the error with my bank.
I seriously doubt you'd receive this type of generous attention with a conflict at most stores. The Gilroy UPS store has an amazing staff!!!
THANK YOU  for all of your help and kind patience!!</Review>

This store does not open at 8:30am as scheduled and their mailbox is full when I called. Very unprofessional and inconsiderate of customers.<//Review>

I have never had such slow service.  ATT told me to take my modem to UPS to return it.  It took her 30 mins to decide she couldn't handle it.  Then another 20 mins to take a personal shipment.  I will be avoiding this store at all costs.</text>

Either google is wrong or the older lady working there wanted to leave early. Google said they were open until 7pm. I raced home after work to get the package i had to send out amd got to the store at 6:15. She was locking up and i told her the internet stated 7. She said the internet is wrong. Who should i be pissed at? Google or the little old lady?</review>

Then going to pay for the delievery i pay with a 10 dollar bill and she says she doesnt have change, she looks at the older lady there which is like 65 or older and she says your gonna have to wait till im done with my customer and takes her sweet time which should have been done is the lady i was with could have switched and takin over for the older woman just starting the transaction. So i had to wait while the woman that was assisting me jus stood behind the counter as i saw a couple of people behind me just waiting.  I shake my head at dissapointment that its horrible service and they need to hire people who want to help and want to work, who will greet the customer and get the job done in a fast pace. Not good service..<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Poor Customer service: Score-Zero. The service is so slow every time I go. I have to plan to be there for at least 45-60 mins. The hours on their website say they close at 7pm on weekdays, but the older lady on the phone told me they close at 6:15. When I get there, she tells me they close at 6:30. The employees there really do not like their job, and it shows in the work they do.</Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< Time>

<text>I am so impressed with the effectiveness of gopher control performed by Pro Pacific. After years of trying different methods and services to get rid of gophers, now so we can landscape our slopes with water from our new well, without the gophers eating everything. This is the first service that has demonstrated their effectiveness. So, I just extended the gopher control with Pro Pacific to the rest of property, and coverage for other pests as well. The technician, Joe, was very professional and knowledgeable as explained everything about their services.   Thanks so much!<//text>< pics>

We recently moved and found that we had not only a spider issue but rats! I quickly called various pest control companies. Pro Pacific was quick and on it and had sent Daniel out the very next day to overlook the problems and provide us with an estimate. He was extremely thorough and walked us through all that his company offered. Their pricing is competitive and fair. We signed the agreement that evening and they sent their technician by the name of Richard out the following morning. Richard was great!! He was thorough and attentive. He and Daniel both answered the many questions I had. I absolutely recommend this company to anyone who is need of pest control services.<//Review>

We ha a bee infestation around a pond that had stegnant water for several months.  I had put a little bleach in the water to keep from getting Msquitoes. Unfortunately I killed the bees.  There were still a few hanging in the area.  He did not find a hive.  He treated the area to keep them from coming back. Things looked much better today. Water is even clear.  We have a 30 day warranty.<//Review>

<Review>Anthony was great!!!
He was very knowledgeable and I believe he was very very thorough also! He went up into two of my attic accesses and setup 7 rat traps today…also went up on my roof and found a couple of openings and he identified an area underneath the water heater external door with an opening that we have now gotten metal mesh applied over it!

Thank you so much Anthony I want to complement him on his professional and friendly demeanor...

Pro Pacific is the Best Pest Control Company! They took care of the mice that invaded our home for 8 months. After hiring other pest control companies, having the attic sealed and cleaned, and having 2 roofing companies check the roof for openings, the mice were still running around the attic and between the first and second floor.  After searching online and finding their website and watching their informative video it was convincing that Pacific Pro can do the job.  From the initial phone call to the weekly trap checks Pacific Pro knows how to do the job well done the first time. Their 2 Techs that came out to look for openings found the hole in the roof the mice had chewed through to get inside the house. They sealed it and still heard activity, but the following week Bobby came out to check the traps and found 3 dead mice. Bobby and the 2 Techs are professionals and courteous. Since then it's been quiet and now we can sleep! The weekly check ups have even been getting shorter and shorter since there has been no activity! Thank you Pro Pacific you have a great team!</text>

At the time of this posting, I have just gotten an estimate.  Daniel Clark came out to evaluate my property for termite damage. It was a thorough inspection (looked at every room and into the attic space) and he offered tiered multiple options (local, enhanced, & full tent treatments) increasing from $ -> $$. He was courteous and knowledgeable, and provides concern to treat an issue rather than upsell u on the most expensive treatment options. Customer service goes a long way so he definitely left a good impression on me.< /text>

There are so many pest control businesses these days. But just because someone is licensed to spray poison in and around your home, it doesn’t mean that they deserve your money.
Pro Pacific Pest Control offers competitive prices...but most importantly they offer the best customer service that I’ve received from any other business ever.< /text>

<Review>Rigoberto worked really hard and did a thorough job of rodent proofing our home. So far so good!
Pro Pacific is a very professional business to work with. They didn’t try to sell us stuff we didn’t need or want. We appreciate the no pressure approach to doing business!< /Review>< Pictures>

Excellent service. Very pleased with their responsiveness and the fact that I see the same technician every month. He is quick to respond to any concerns we might have during his visit and is always pleasant and cheerful. Great experience!</Text>

Rita who made scheduling quick and simple and accommodated my schedule without issue and with a great attitude.  Ricky the tech who came for the estimate (on time) and was again very accommodating and kept it all so simple and quick that we were able to sign contract right there and then and he even performed the initial service same day!   Jill who got me the insurance and contractor information for my files within minutes!  Everyone had a great attitude, high work ethic, so rare to find today and VERY much appreciated.  These guys are an amazing find!< /Review>< Time>

Juan was here for the monthly service and we also requested spaying for spiders. H e was efficient and through. We like having Juan come to the house as he takes our concerns to heart to make our home pest free.</Text>

I have used Pro Pacific for the past few years and at two different residences. The customer service is wonderful, the technicians are always helpful and friendly and their service is effective. I would definitely recommend Pro Pacific to anyone looking to rid their home of insects/rodents.</Review>

Pro Pacific Pest Control were able to come to my home immediately when a swarm of bees flew into my eaves. Jason did a great job and they followed up the day after. Thoroughly recommend. Great customer service</review>

Pro Pacific responded promptly to my online registration. Jeff provided details of the service, scheduled a same day appointment and emailed a copy of the contract. James arrived during the scheduled time and met with my husband who commented very positively on James' service. He signed the contract, paid $80 and now we feel secure that Pro Pacific will take care of our pest control needs in the future. We are very pleased with our decision to choose Pro Pacific.<//text>

<Review>We were very impressed at how thorough and effective Pro Pacific and our rep, Richard was at relieving our attic from rat infestation!  They came four weeks in a row to check the traps and remove any rats.  They also offered to fix all our vents so the problem wouldn’t re-occur. We would definitely call on them again but hope there will be no need!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dbf49910b0fb93:0x11321c2ed124f443<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Yesterday ants were everywhere! Now today they're all gone already! 👍 After getting really expensive quotes from other companies I was extremely happy to find Pro Pacific offered such an affordable rate. I was even more happy with the service when Jason, the technician showed up. He was very professional and thorough. He explained everything in detail when I asked him about the service and the chemicals used. He assured me that it was safe for my 3 1/2 year old. He was very knowledgeable. I highly recommend their services. They even knocked down all of the spider webs in and around my house.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Called different places , although I did not get an exact quote from customer service  (unlike other companies that I called) yet I found the Pro Pacific's explanation to be more truthful so I gave them a try , Anthony showed up, very accurate in his performance,  friendly and caring. I ended up with a very fair price even better than what other companies that had quoted me over the phone. I even had a text and phone call from Anthony about what else I should watch out for.
Thank you Anthony.</text>

Pro Pacific Pest Control was great!! Came right out for my bees in the chimney.  Their technician Anthony was proffessional and courteous and took care of the problem in no time. It was a pleasure to do business with them from start to finish. Have not had service like this in quite awhile and plan on using them for any pests in the future.<//text>

<text>I am thus far quite pleased with my Pro Pacific Pest Control experience. My first telephone contact to arrange service was very easy and an appointment for the first house visit was set for a few days later. Jordan arrived with a smile and described the service he would complete; he was happy to answer all my questions. He was certain to reinforce the company policy for no cost return visits for any special problems that might occur prior to the next scheduled visit. A follow up customer service telephone call came a day later to make certain I was satisfied with my experience. On the basis of my initial experience, I highly recommend PPP Control.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80dbf49910b0fb93:0x11321c2ed124f443</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Do not even consider this company as an option.  They have absolutely no regard for customer satisfaction.  I have been in the customer service industry for over 25 years and this is the first time I have had to deal with a company less concerned about the customers’ satisfaction.  We have used other pest control companies and had no problems with pests for up to a year.  When I called them and told them the ants were back, they said we were 20 days over our 30 day warranty. I told them that they did not inform me prior to their visit that we would have to leave the premises for 2 hours. I have children.  I cannot just pick up and go at a moment’s notice. The guy did a sloppy, hurried process and left me worrying about the effect it would have on my kids.  He backtracked and said that we didn't really need to vacate.  It was just a precaution. (really?)  We paid $185 for them to fumigate our house.  When I told them that less than 2 months was unacceptable, they told me my only option was to get on a quarterly plan for 1 year for $98 every 3 months.  Can you believe that? The person told me that was all she could do.  I was so pissed; I told her we would not do business with them anymore. Her response was sorry, that's the best we can do. You would think that a business truly concerned about customer satisfaction would have tried a little harder to retain our business.  From being in the business of customer satisfaction, I know that 87% of customers who have a bad experience will not only return to the business, but will tell as many people as possible about their experience.  So there you go.  Do business with this company at your own expense, and I do mean expense in the most literal way.<//Text>

I have used ProPacific in the past and always had great service. At this new property I detected a rodent problem and they had Brenner out to me on the same day.
Brenner has been by far the best tech ProPacific has sent me as he is well mannered, timely and a truly professional guy.</Text>

Excellent job with customers and removing attic rats. On time and proficient at closing entry into the home. Professional business as well as affordable. They will also come out on weekends and during holidays. That's great customer service.

The technician was very attentive and informative of the ant problem. We've been having this problem for few weeks!  Additionally, the customer service representatives extremely responsive to addressing my concerns - I had a  scheduling problem last Thursday and the representative was on the target by rescheduling the appointment right away.   I'm impressed with a whole team effort to solve customer problem!</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I have been a Pro Pacific customer for over a year. I live in a gated community, {an Association,} and for several years my parents and I were using the exterminator that the Association had hired. They were fine for a while, then they {my parents }became dissatisfied with them; so we stopped using them.
Fast forward several years later...I  am living alone now, and one day last June, I was in my bedroom, and I noticed two rows of ants crawling down the wall over by the window. So I thought "That's it, I'm calling the exterminator."  The first call I placed was to the Association, but they told me they no longer provide exterminator service. Went online to see what was out there. I knew I did not want to go with Orkin or Terminex, because they are nationwide, and have enough business. I wanted to support someone local, specifically in the town where I live, {which I think they do have a "branch." }
They came out, and like others have commented, they were friendly knowledgeable, they didn't make me feel pressured into making a decision. {I put that pressure on myself, because I so desperately wanted to have the ants gone!}  and did not make you feel like any question you asked was a stupid one! I also appreciated their price. {I will be honest, Pro Pacific was the first place I called,} but I am still satisfied with the job, and professionalism they provide.</review>< Pics>

<gmap_id>0x80dbf49910b0fb93:0x11321c2ed124f443</gmap_id><text>We were in an epic battle against a never-ending army of ants that had raged for several days. At first it was a few ants and we easily got rid of them. Then more would show up but we did the same thing. There were times we thought we won only to soon realize that we in over our heads as more and more ants kept showing up.

So I Yelped an extermination company and several dozen popped up. I read tons of reviews and requested quotes using Yelp's feature. All of them responded but their approach varied and didn't come off friendly, professional,  or knowledgeable. As a matter of fact, some people were pretty vague. They would say things like, "it depends" or "we need to have someone come out to inspect" or "we don't service that area" even though their office was less than 5 miles from our home.

Pro Pacific Pest Control was the outlier. I called after 6 p.m. knowing that they were closed according to Yelp hoping that someone would answer. And Mike did! He was friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. He was not vague in the least. On the contrary, he explained their services and pricing and even recommended one based on what I told him.

He said he would have someone come out the next morning between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. and James showed up at 10:15 a.m. He even called to let me know when he was on his way. James was very cool and friendly. He did a great job explaining how and why he was treating certain areas for the ants and other pests like silverfish and wasps. Sadly he works in the Inland Empire so we won't see him again. I hope that the next technician is just as great. I'm fairly certain based on the service from Mike and James that I will be satisfied.

As far as the ants are concerned, they became like Houdini. Poof! All gone. The next day I saw dead crickets around the house and a few spiders, too. I am extremely satisfied with the experience so far and as long as the service continues, it should remain this way.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Name>Rene Cortez<//Name><resp>None< /resp></record>

<Text>Andrew was very friendly, took time to listen to our questions and even laugh with us when talking about our gopher problem (catch it and putting it head on a steak to warn all the other gophers not to come into our yard). :-)< /Text>< time>

<Review>I was overrun by ants and called ProPacific.  They booked for the very next day in the morning, which was a total relief.  The tech was polite & efficient.  Immediately afterwards, there were NO ANTS.  I am thrilled.  Thank you so much for the excellent service!< /Review>< response>

< Review>
Pro pacific did an awesome job on the first day out of our service agreement. Everyone was great since onboarding to our technician, Zacarias, who took the time to explain the process of getting rid of our outdoor ants and spider issues. I will take advantage of having them come out again for the free of charge retreatment since it can take a couple times to eliminate the outdoor activity. Thank you.</Review>

<name>Ben Floyd</name><date>1532272544238< /date><Rate>5</Rate><Review>This company was referred to me by a coworker of mine after I meantioned I was looking for a routine service for insect control around the house. I signed up for their quarterly service based off their reviews and great pricing. Fast forward a few months and it turns out we have a rodent problem that unfortunately wasn’t taken care of prior to purchasing our house. I called up Pro Pacific Pest Control and explained the situation. They sent out Gao to do a thorough inspection of the house, explain to me his findings and recommend the best course of action to take. He was extremely professional and knowledgeable and I did not feel pressured into any service, he simply weighed the pros and cons of having the service he recommended vs not. I went with the trapping service followed by a full house sealing that comes with a 2 year warranty. They set traps throughout the house and for 3 weeks came to check on them, even coming more frequently when I noticed a trap had been sprung and I didn’t want the house to smell of dead rodents due to the heat, all with no fuss or hassle and free of charge. The final stage was a full house seal, where they spend the day sealing up every nook and cranny of the house, places I couldn’t even imagine a rodent using to enter. Yanky and Raul were my sealers and they went above and beyond. They showed me the places that were going to be sealed and how they were going to do it, even explaining WHY they were doing it and the reason it needed to be done a specific way. Pro Pacific Pest Control is a great company to have a service with and you can always expect great customer service and friendly contractors at your door. A big thank you again to Gao, Yanky and Raul for making this bad situation (rodents) into a better one. My family and I can sleep a little better now knowing the house is rodent free and knowing we have a great warranty on the service we purchased.</Review>< Pictures>

Who wants a root canal,😟 but if you need one, I HIGHLY recommend this place!  From the time I called for an appointment the front office staff was friendly, and very helpful. Upon my arrival, I was treated with the utmost care.  My consultation & the procedure went well. BOKHOUR,  DDS was the BEST! Great team work with her assistant Rocio. I nearly went to sleep the process was so smooth. NO pain! The next day, still NO pain. So again, if you need a root canal, this is the place!<//Text>

<Time>1615433482048<//Time><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Name>Claus Weisemann< /Name><Review>Well, a root canal is not my first idea of a fun afternoon, but I was in pain and needed help.
Medical and administrative staff were very friendly, waiting time was only a few minutes. Dr Patwardhan explained the procedure, very professionally and without any rush and then went to work. About 45 minutes later she took the time to show me the final result on the X-ray.
Today, the office called me to check on me. I could report back “all good, pain free”.

So I don’t wish a root canal on anybody but if you need one that’s the place to go.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

I went in for a consultation under constant pain, met Dr. Patwardhan who understood exactly what my situation was, and did the root canal right then. I felt no pain during the procedure and was out within an hour. Her assistant was also very kind and thoughtful. They said I might get leftover pain and aches from the procedure but I've barely had any trouble.

I came to Endo Care and was treated by Dr. Patwardhan for a badly needed root canal. She did a great job and was very thorough. I then came back for a Retreatment of my first ever root canal, performed by another doctor which was a horrible experience. Dr. Patwardhan was amazing from the numbing all the way through and Rosio was very accommodating and comforting. I put my headphones on and from start to finish it was wonderful. Thank you Dr. Patwardhan!</review>

<Review>They did a great job on my root canal. You hear horror stories about how painful root canals can sometimes be, but with Endo Care it was completely painless.

They also did a flawless job with the internal bleaching afterwards. It was my front tooth, so I was a bit hesitant, but the bleached tooth now matches my other teeth. Before the bleaching, the tooth was a slightly different color than the rest of my teeth.

Dr. Bokhour even volunteered to come in on the weekend if I had an pain (which I didn't).

I cannot say enough good things about Valerie and Dr. Bokhour.<//Review>< resp>

Ms. Valerie and Dr. Hamid took great care of me. I was nervous due to past experiences. They answered all of my questions and made me feel very comfortable. I even had music to listen too, which helped a lot. I never thought that I would say this but I had a great root canal experience (I had two others). Most of all I felt like I was a person instead of a number. Thank you!<//Text>

Dr. Hamid did a great job explaining purpose and procedure and also had great anesthesia technique that kept discomfort to a minimum.   Assistants - were highly skilled and knowledgeable making for excellent team.

They gave me an appointment right away to treat my toothache. Turned out I need a root canal which Dr. Barnes and assistant Rocio did with finesse.  Everything was explained clearly prior to and after the procedure. I was well on my way to daily routine just the next day. I was quite impressed by the well run operations there.</text>

<review>This is one of the better medical offices I have visited. From the front desk to the Doctor-  Very professional. Went in to have a cavity filled with a possible root canal which wasn’t needed thank God. They could’ve just gone ahead and done it but I am thankful that they’re honest. I would recommend them to anyone and everyone I know</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

It was fantastic, remember it was a root canal, the team from front desk to the dr. was supreme and very professional. I had not had a root canal in over 30 years the procedure has certainly improve for the better, although it took a little longer the trauma of a root canal was non existant. Thank you guys for caring! Extremely well done.< /review>

I went in today for root canal and my team today was Dr Rezai and his assistant Diane.
I was very nervous but from the start Diane was reassuring and caring. They work together very well as a team and they were very professional. I felt very calm and cared for during the entire procedure due to their excellent bedside manner. I parked at a meter and the receptionist offered to keep an eye on the
time for me . I thought it was a really kind offer and she went above and beyond to help me.
I highly recommend this office 😊<//text>

A great experience for two root canals????  Thought I would never say that but it is absolutely true!!   The facility is modern, clean and loaded with  new technical equipment.  However, the staff is amazing especially Dr. Sheila Patwardhan who did a procedure that was essentially pain free with few after effects.  Very informative and assuring while working on me.  If you have to have a root canal this is the place to have it.< /Text>

I absolutely felt compelled to write this review. Today, I had the most awesome and amazing experience at the  Endocare dentist office! Everyone was sooo nice and so supportive. And might I add that I absolutely cannot stand going to the dentist. My perspective has now been altered. If every experience with the dentist went this well I might go just cause. Lol. But seriously, outstanding job. Thank you Dr. Pat, thank you Mindy, thank you Sue, and thank you Feliz! God knew I needed some happiness today and he sent it right to me right on time! You guys are rockstars and this is truly an experience that I will never forget! I’m smiling at this very moment! 😊< /text>

They got me right into a next day appointment when I called with tooth pain. Staff was very friendly and what I appreciated the most was the  thoroughness of the front office staff. They went leaps and bounds beyond my past dental/doctor experiences when it came to breaking down the cost, what my insurance would cover, what I would be charged, etc. In and out in just over an hour. Best root canal ever!!  Will come back and change this to 5 stars if my tooth is still holding up after few days :)<//Text>

Can’t say enough about Dr Rezai and Dr Shinbori. They are absolutely great overall and highly experienced. They have the kindness, gentility and professionalism you barely see. I went to both offices, Oakland and Alameda and their service and professionalism simply excels. You can expect outstanding technology and expertise from both doctors. In my case, I came here as a result of an unfortunate and unfinished malpractice performed in another dental place. Here, at EndoCare, they reviewed my case and never hesitate on providing me with the appropriate treatment and find the best solution for my situation. For those who get nervous about dental treatments, don't look any further, this is the place for you to go if you ever need these type of procedures. I am greatly Thankful with EndoCare team. You Rock!</text>

I have EXTREME dental-anything anxiety because I was traumatized by Dr. Wells, my East Orange,  New Jersey dentist from the 60's.  Novacain needles were huge, and there was no gentle approach with use of a topical anesthetic to lessen that little "pinch" dentists say we will feel.  My sisters and I went to the same dentist as our parents, not taken to a pediatric dentist, so our tears did not resonate.  Fast forward to 5 decades later, and I am still a basket case in any dental procedure chair.  Thank goodness for the compassionate and exceptional staff and endodontists at Endo Care.  They supported my need for mild sedation and provided a pain free (before AND after) root canal.  Dr. P did my procedure, and Jennifer called the next day to check on me.  If I could give 10 stars, I would give 110.  For real.</text>

Dr. Patwardhan is a fantastic surgeon. She has performed three root canals on me. Each procedure was less than an hour, no problem with pain.  She  goes out of her way to answer any question you have. Staff(Diane) also great. I would highly recommend Endocare. Two thumbs up!!</Review>

When my crown fell off it exposed an old root canal and in order to avoid infection, my dentist referred me to EndoCare for a thorough evaluation of my tooth base. I went to the EndoCare Alameda office and easily found street parking. I was greeted by Jennifer, their friendly receptionist, and completed general medical information forms. Diane welcomed me and expertly completed preliminary X-rays, then also provided me details of my treatment prep on my follow up appointment. On the day of the evaluation, I received clear information from Dr. Alyson Barnes on how to save my tooth and I returned in a few days for the root canal treatment. Dr. Barnes has a steady and skilled hand for painless injecting of novocaine and drilling. Dr. Barnes and Diane alerted me to changes in procedures during the treatment to ease my nerves. This care for patient comfort was much appreciated. I took three 200mg ibuprofen tabs after the treatment just in case but was fine later. If you also get a cold shiver down your spine when you remember past dental treatment experiences, don't delay treating your teeth and see Dr. Barnes.</Text>

<username>Rachel Loftin</username><text>This is my “go to” place for EndoCare needs.  I am having old bridge work replaced and needed a couple root canals.  I saw Dr Patwarden a few years back and knew she would take excellent care of me again. She is a gentle and patient doctor that takes extra time to make sure the job gets done right.  That’s very important after bad experiences with other endodontists 20 years ago. I eventually lost a tooth when another dentist left a part of a tool in a root canal. So, when I say I trust Dr Patwarden for all my endo needs, that’s saying a lot!  The root canals were done with care and I am looking forward to my sparkling new smile!  I rate 100 stars!<//text><UserId.>112690515327060296580</UserId.>< gmap_id>

Dr. Ali Rezai performed my root canal in his Alameda office. He is a critical thinker who has mastered the art of endodontics. One of my roots was difficult to locate, but Dr. Rezai didn't give up. He was tenacious in finding and properly treating the challenging root. Between the two phases of my procedure, I reached out to his office staff because I was at work almost in tears. I was set to wait two weeks for a tooth extraction, but I wasn't going to last: I was in so much pain. If Dr. Rezai hadn't referred me to an oral surgeon, I would have suffered quite a bit during those two weeks. My tooth was extracted in less than 24 hours. I appreciated Dr. Rezai's compassion. I perceive him as a perfectionist with a sense of humor. Why do personality traits matter? Well, it was just nice to interact with a doctor who is professional, caring, and personable. On a final note, each and every one of his office staff members and assistants were courteous, hospitable, and friendly.< /text>

My experience with a very painful root canal was made as pleasant as possible by the talented staff at Endo Care. Dr. Shinbori and Valerie were compassionate, professional and supportive.

Thank you!< /review>

<user_name>Mark Linkiewicz<//user_name><Text>If you need a root canal this is the place. Dr. Patwardhan and Diane are the best at what they do. I was completely comfortable throughout the entire procedure and I felt no pain. None. My tooth was completed before I knew it and they even put on a playlist of classical piano music to make everything even more relaxing.

Bottom line if you need endodontal work done this is your place.<//Text><userid>108197412667538681903</userid>< Rating>

This place is great. I was referred here by my usual dentist for an emergency root canal. I'd never had one before and was nervous, but honestly didn't feel a thing. Very nice and keep you up to date about exactly what they are doing in your mouth. Parking is easy  because they valedate for this huge lot across the street. All the staff was kinda and helpful. I saw Dr. Patwardhan and was very happy with her. Also, it always smelks good in here and feels more like a lounge than a dental office. Definitely would come back.</review>

Endocare office was exceptional! I had an emergency root canal on March 30, 2016 in the Alameda dental office and all services were amazingly wonderful!

Dr. Ali Rezai is the best endodontist I have seen to date. He is highly recommended for the following reasons:
1.  Knowledge, experience and training, Dr. Mahardi and Tong my wonderful  "A+!" dentists in Berkeley and their great office support staff rate Dr. Rezai, "the best!"  And, yes, after my treatment yesterday, I agree whole heartily!

2.  Extremely professional!  Dr. Rezai is very friendly, communicative, healthy, warm and positive. He is very explicit explaining everything throughout my dental procedure. In addition, Dr. Rezai collaborative style with Sylvia his dental assistant was seamless, positive, respectful and efficient. This allowed my root canal to be done beautifully with zero pain!

3.  The entire office is immaculate and the practice has state of the art equipment.

All in all, I loved my treatment and all of the services I received from Dr. Rezai, Sylvia and his additional front office staff: Jennifer and Teresa!  I highly recommend Dr. Rezai. He's a 10!😃<//text>

Came to EndoCare for a root canal. I was nervous as hell. The staff here are more than welcoming. Stephanie was soo helpful with the whole process. I would defiantly recommend this place if you need endodontic therapy. I was treated by Dr Patwardhan, as anxious as I was, I felt at ease. Thank you soo much</Text>

<text>I was referred to Dr. Ali Rezai by my dentist, Dr. Dean, in September. I very foolishly delayed making an appointment (always listen to your dental professionals!) and the "shadow" in the root of my molar became an abcess during the Thanksgiving holiday. I made an appointment Wednesday for the following Monday. By Friday I was in excruciating pain and called Dr. Rezai's office. Thank the lucky stars they were open. Although he couldn't treat me that day, he did get me on antibiotics and pain meds until I could have the retreatment done the following week at the Alameda facility.

I met with Dr. Nick Norton and Michelle (who I met in the Oakland office) and they were absolutely wonderful! They put me at ease after I let them know I was a little anxious and that it takes quite a bit anesthetic to numb me properly. Absolutely no pain - the most was the slight pinch from the shot! They were done in a little over an hour and I was on my merry way. The follow-up treatment two weeks later took even less time and again, no pain.

The offices in Oakland and Alameda are very clean and well kept. The front office staff are polite, professional and accommodating and the medical staff and Drs. Rezai and Norton know their specialty ~ I would highly recommend them for anyone undergoing endodontic treatment ~ they are a first rate practice!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f8695c6feaa9b:0x4ea728f016db8fbd<//Gmap_id></record>

I thought I needed to replace my battery and the port for charging. Clean the port put a new battery and all while I waited maybe 15 minutes. Im completely happy with the service and the cost! I’ve used them probably 3-4 times and every time they’ve exceeded my expectations. Super knowledgeable super honest what more could you want.<//Text>

I broke my phone screen and apple store was too expensive so I went online and I came across Telekom wireless. I requested a quote and Adde responded quickly  with a reasonable price. I went in and got my screen fixed. My phone works like a new phone! You can't even tell that its been worked on! MAKE SURE YOU TRY TELEKOM WIRELESS OUT!<//text>

So, whaire do I start?
My sister broke her iPhone XR last week and I didn't want to spend a lot trying to fix this phone because I know she will brake it again. I remembered that Telekom wireless had fixed a phone for me recently and I was happy. I gave Adde a call and he told me that he had the screen instock and to come in. I went around 4 and I was out by 4:30! I will continue to use Telekom for all my phone/tablit needs! Now the iphone XR looks brand new! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!< /text>

<text>I don't usually write reviews but I had to because this is by far the best customer service when it come to phone repairs. Very fast turn around time and they provide quality parts. These guys can fix virtually anything and give very reasonable prices. I've been going to them for multiple repairs throughout the years on my various phones and they never disappoint. If I could give 10 stars you bet I would!< /text><Date>1449777118449< /Date>< rate>

I had been told by two companies my phone needed a new screen. Estimates where  $180/$200. As soon as this guy got my phone in his hand, he new all I needed was a battery & new tempered glass cover. Total cost was  $30. This guy is an expert. Wish I had found him 1st.<//Text>

The guy there is a thief & he has two illegal mexican workers lying on his couch that are additionally thief's. Avoid this place at all costs. If you bring him a Iphone 5 or newer with a clean IEIM he tries to swipe it while locking your phone. It is possible with a cloned operating system! the valuable thing is the info of the IEIM! He is dishonest & I pray they arrest him! He froze the phone we brought to that store.

PLEASE do not trust that guy or anyone at that shop!</Review>

<response>None</response><Review>well i went here looking for decent laptop for my mother. i was interested in a dell as i know they have good logetivity. well the dell they advertised had a chipped corner so i instantly turned away from that one. they had an hp and a compaq for the same price. so i asked to see the hp and they could not get the display case open for me to view it. so i checked out the compaq. it was marked with stickers explaining the details. it said it was a dual core 2.4 cpu  with 3gb of ram. well after some time of trying it out i was ok with the computer even though i am not a compaq fan. so i purchased the computer. have been using it for about three days and have been noticing it is kinda slow for a dual core with 3gb of ram. so i began going thru the system info and have found it is a single core 2.4 processor and only has 2gb of ram installed. and all the bios and operating softwafe asside from windows is all hp. i am a little upset that i was sold something that is no longer worth the money i paid i will be calling them for more info as to why this was sold to me with the wrong software and less performance by far than what should be.. i would be weary of any laptop purchases there. make sure you go through the entire system before buying anything there.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Latter-day Saints are a temple-building and temple-loving people. It has been so from the earliest days of the Church. Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord declared that "my people are always commanded to build [temples] In temples, we can draw closer to the Lord, we can learn more about His plan for our happiness, we can receive essential ordinances for our exaltation, and we can perform vicarious service on behalf of those who have died without the gospel of Jesus Christ. The culminating blessing of the temple is that we can be joined together as families for eternity, so that our relationships with those we love will last forever.<//text>

This temple is visible on the hill above I-5 as you head north towards Los Angeles leaving San Diego.  It is a pure white castle of marble and has been known to many young girls as the princess castle.  The symbolism on the exterior is amazing and I especially love the seal of Melchizedek.  The atrium within the temple is also really amazing.< /text>

<Review>This temple truly is a House of the Lord. His spirit is felt inside and out. I come here often to learn of Him and to feel of His peace and love. Jesus Christ is at the center of our temple worship. A family's eternal potential begins here through sacred temple ordinances. Only members of the Church of Jesus Christ in good standing may enter the temple, but all are invited to enjoy it's beautiful grounds, peaceful setting and amazing architecture.< /Review><date>1615841258876< /date><rate>5</rate><user_id>114840619599009101812</user_id>< Pictures>

One of my favorite temples! The exterior is magnificent, but so is the interior. It's truly a House of the Lord. I've been here for baptisms, weddings, and endowments. It's a great place to stop and take photos even if you're not a member but have a zest for photography and like beautiful buildings. It's probably the most beautiful building in San Diego, and that's saying something.<//Text>

What a special place this is. Even during the pandemic, just being outside the gate offers peace. This was stunning at night during the Christmas season. If you are looking for a place to feel comfort and light, this is a good place to start. To learn more about this sacred place, you can go to ChurchofJesusChrist.org< /text>

<Review>What a beautiful temple. Even when the spires were undergoing construction, very gorgeous.  The highway is super close, it is easy to get to the temple. The constitution in front of the temple is to extend out the trolley so it will be even easier to visit this temple in the future when it is finished. The grounds are gorgeous and the plants are very colorful! I even saw hummingbirds! If you are visiting San Diego, make sure to come to the temple (whether you are a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or not, the grounds are open to everyone to enjoy and have a peaceful, thoughtful walk.)<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMt5CPgbSdLSX4s1JAxV3SYlcEuAioRYfVgkUQq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url':

Beautiful church, lovely garden that's very well maintained. It looks all the more wonderful with the lights on. The temple however, isn't open to the general public. Ample parking space available and a good place for the kids to spend their evening.<//Text>

<review>The San Diego temple was located right off the freeway and we kept seeing it as we drove up and down La Jolla. So we decided to stop by and check out the temple.

it is open for guests till it closes and there ample parking available as long as there is no service. it is best to see the temple at night with the lights lit on especially during the holiday periods when they do an exceptional job decorating the trees and the grounds around the temple. Just check out the photos posted here to get a glimpse of what it looks like.< /review>< Pictures>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>Being raised in Catholic environment, and being influenced to appreciate art and architecture by my architect father, I have always been fascinated by design and architecture of houses of worship. I became fully aware of this when I visited Vatican first time in 1980s.

That being said, when I had opportunity to explore the inside of Tabernacle in Temple Square in Salt Lake City with Mormon friends in mid-1990s, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to explore from the back of the church as the choir rehearsed. It was an amazing and enlightening experience.

I saw California Temple across the freeway on my way to my hotel in San Diego. It was striking contrast to the skyline surrounding it, so we decided to visit a few days later -- not considering that houses of worship have been closed in California due to COVID. Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed we could not explore the inside of this Temple when we arrived, but made the best of it.

It was a challenge to capture this fantastic structure in photographs, but we drove around and found several spots to capture different angles and bits of the building. If given the chance, I would be more than happy to see the inside of the building, walk around the gardens as I believe that it would be just as striking and fascinating as outside.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Absolutely beautiful building. Friendly staff at the Visitor Information kiosk. You can check it out even if you don’t plan to go inside for worship. Peaceful feeling and impressive grounds. The Temple has a unique feeling about it. An oasis of faith in a busy world.<//Review>

We love this temple. Many people don’t know that the grounds of the temple are open to the public. If you have not done so I would highly recommend visiting the grounds to just walk around and see this beautiful building up close.</text>

Such a beautiful Temple! Quiet, Serene and filled with the spirit. The grounds and building are breath-taking. Parking however is a challenge. When you are finished here they have a wonderful cafeteria with great food. Although there are lots of stairs there is an elevator to help us get around!</review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>This is a beautiful building with immaculately kept and gorgeous grounds. It’s worth visiting and walking the grounds just to enjoy the scenery—whether or not you have interest in, or are affiliated with the church who owns it. The grounds are open to the public, visitors are welcome. We try to come every time we visit San Diego.< /Review>< pics>

Although the temple in Laie on the windward side of Oahu will always hold a special place in my heart this Tempe here in La Jolla is well manicured and the perfect location to take pictures after your wedding. The architecture is something straight out of "The Last Starfighter" an 80's movie I absolutely love and always puts a smile on my face as I'm driving by it on the 5 freeway.<//text>

<text>One of the most beautiful temples I have ever seen. It looks like a castle from a fairy tale.   I love just looking at it! A wonderful place! There is a certain calm and peaceful feeling just being near it.
Of course, if you're not Mormon, you will not be allowed to go inside, but the outside is very impressive and makes for some great photos.
So, so, beautiful. It is lit at night, and you can see its beauty as you drive òn Interstate 5 near La Jolla.Love this place.Visited May 2016<//text>< date>

Gates we're open on Sunday. While the building was closed, they had knowlegable guides that walked us around the outside and shared the history.</text>

It’s always a great experience to come to the temple. This building is absolutely gorgeous outside and inside. It is well worth the visit to come by and check out the grounds if you are not a member of the church. Of course it’s always worth the visit for members as well. We went while on vacation and were glad we took the time to stop by.</Review>

<Text>Beautiful place visible from the freeway. Temples are usually quiet places where contemplation is encouraged. The grounds for the San Diego Temple are smaller than other temples, however. Nevertheless, the Temple is strikingly beautiful and a reminder that God is ever present.< /Text>< pics>

If there is anything close to a Disney Castle in this life, this could potentially be the one! What a majestic building! I loved it there and I wish I lived near by to go more often to visit. Very beautiful place both during the day and night.< /review>

<text>It's the House of the Lord.  Nothing more needs to be said.  Treated with utmost respect by everyone.  Before going in, I wandered around the grounds. So peaceful and calming.  Saw a lot of people...a few families..taking pictures and walking around.

Was blessed to watch as wedding photos were being taken on the front lawn. Wow.  Just so beautiful.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>When people ask me where my favorite restaurant is, I tell them its the San Diego temple cafeteria. Its actually really good food, and before or after you could do a session. I'll be the perfect day/evening/night just visit the temple have lunch and or dinner and go through the temple.
Edit: Cafeteria not open to general public.< /Text>< Pictures>

Really beautiful Temple. You can see it right off of the freeway and the people there were very inviting. they even have a tour down in old town San Diego if you’re interested in learning some of the history. It was very cool seeing them repainting the temple as it was a very difficult job. I recommend stopping by and taking a look!</Review>

We found the building and the whole atmosphere nothing but creepy.  We would have liked to get an impression from the inside, but it's for authorized people only. Two stars instead of one because of the beautiful gardens.< /review>

We had a wonderful time inside the Temple and had kind volunteers helping out whenever needed.

I highly recommend taking a tour from the missionaries at the Information Desk located outside.<//Text>< Rating>

Architecturally, what you get when you cross a Disney castle and a space ship.
For members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, this is the area's most sacred place of worship and service---a most welcome refuge from worldly ruckus. For those who are not members, visitors are welcome to view the outside grounds of perhaps the most stunning of The Church's temples.<//Review>

Beautiful area. Lots of flowers and great places for picture taking. The temple looks good from every angle. It's a sacred place for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There is a small waiting area inside as well as restrooms and a water fountain. Only endowed members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints can enter past the waiting area.  There is also a temple clothing store near the temple as well as clothing rental inside for members. There are  missionaries on site to answer any questions.< /text>

No better place anywhere on Earth.  I still remember the day that building was dedicated by President Hinkley and where we were in the Celestial room.  I've been taught so much within those walls.  I'm grateful to have been fortunate enough to always live near a Temple.<//text>

The Christmas lights make this place look like a Wonderland! The gardens are beautiful that encircle it. He will also feel a spiritual uplifting as you walk the quiet grounds.</Text>

Nothing makes you feel better than a trip to the San Diego Temple. Even if you're not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the temple and its grounds are beautiful, and a wonderful place to spend some time and feel the peace of the place. At Christmas time the grounds are decorated with Christmas lights, and there is Christmas music and a nativity.</Text>

The garden is beautiful. It is by a freeway, but there is a wall to block out that view. Incredibly peaceful and beautiful. It's like a big castle, definitely worth the trip</text>

<review>Need a spiritual boost?  This is the perfect place for prayer and quiet reflection.  Gardens are open to the public, free of charge. Representatives onsite to answer questions.  And if you visit in December, there’s the bonus of Christmas lights and music.<//review>< pics>

Very interesting place to visit. The architecture of the building is very cool. It reminds me of a fairy tale castle. They have people there to explain about the building and the religion and what the building is used for. It's worth a visit.</Text>

You can feel a spirit of tranquility when you enter the grounds. The green grass and beautiful flowers with the added sound of birds singing.  Right now,the towers have scaffolding, but, come July  it will be gone. All are invited to walk the grounds!</text>

I love that the celestial room connects to a garden on the upper levels, where you can look up and see the spire with the angel Moroni.</text>< Pics>

<review>This temple is amazing. I went inside this temple for the first time a couple weeks ago and it is so beautiful. It has so many unique features as well. The Celestial room is also amazing. It is really cool that you can access it from two different floors. I and planning on coming here again in the future.<//review></record>

Absolutely beautiful!!! I've seen pictures of it for years but to actually see it in person it's so much better!! This is a huge temple!
The amount of workmanship is incredible!

The grounds are gorgeous and it's crazy to see how to see how close it is to freeway and yet when you walk around you totally forget about the busy work still going flying by and the peace the temple brings!!< /text>

Beautiful architecture but the organization behind it is less so. Here's to hoping the church promotes more healthy and loving dialogue to the community.<//review>

<Review>I have attended several temples, but the experience here was really memorable. Everyone was beyond friendly and the design is so unique. A must-see for any church member visiting the area, and a great stop for anyone else passing by. When we were there they had an information booth outside for visitors.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc06d32da29aff:0x3681ef10f8a92fa4</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Just to walk on sacred ground gives you peace of mind knowing Heavenly Father is watching over us.  Weather or not you are Mormon, you can experience the beauty of a Temple.  Everyone of the Temples built are as unique as you and I.  Our love of Heavenly Father and his Son Christ Jesus are what bind us together as human beings.  Temples are not secret, but they are sacred.  Take a minute and drive onto the Temple Grounds and speak with the Missionaries.  They can answer questions and explain the going on's inside of the Temples.<//Review>

<review>What a magnificent Temple filled and decorated with so much symbolism.  From the symbol of Melchizedek throughout, to the spires that assist the viewer in gazing Heaven ward thus raising our thoughts from mere mortal maters, to the Angel Moroni facing the East awaiting Christ's return.  This is a place to come, learn of Christ, and feel His peace.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

This temple is stunning!! We really had a magical time there for my son’s wedding. My granddaughter thought we were at Elsa’s castle, so she was a little confused why there wasn’t any ice or snow until we reminded her that Elsa melted the snow with love at the end of the movie. Then she ran around singing ‘Let It Go’ and holding her hands up to shower everyone with love.<//text>

A one-of-kind edifice for the performance of the highest rites of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, among which are sealings (marriages) "for time and all eternity," not just "'til death do you part," and which is the second-most popular location for such ordinances in the worldwide Church, behind only the Salt Lake Temple.< /review>

<Review>Beautiful grounds and temple bldg.. from the outside. I live near it and am basing my review on a Christmastime visit with my Dad.
I heard not even a non-Mormon may see or tour the inside, not even with a Mormon..true? The Google Maps name is a misnomer, SD CA Temple! Silliness, what are you deceptively hiding from?!.. I mean please. At least put LDS as part of the Name. My two cents.</Review>< userid>

< Review>
This is one of the most beautiful churches in California! There is a lot of areas for photography opportunity. This place is nice as it doesn't have anyone that tries to shoo you out as long as you are being respectful and considerate. Yes that means don't try to do a lingerie shot here!
Anyways you have the front of the church to get right from the get go and then you have small walkways you can walk around the church for different walkways and backdrops of the church. The pure white building makes it so great, On overcast days you kind of have to be careful while taking pictures because it can cause shadows on the models which makes them way too dark to match the church

This place kind of reminds me of a kingdom oblivion for those kingdom hearts fans! Kind of feel like doing a cosplay shoot here!< /Review>

< review>
A beautiful, and spiritual temple, which requires exceptional inspiration to even partially understand.  A temple is place where sacred ordinances take place, something almost completely unknown in these days of general downfall and apostasy, of people and nations.

Over the 50 years of my membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, I have found that there is a great resistance toward true spiritual values, and an easy acceptance of low, debased thought and action. That is why our nation is drifting in immorality, and unbelief in God and Jesus Christ, and all things of a finer spiritual nature.

But, the scriptures tell us that straight is the way, and narrow is the gate which leads to salvation, and FEW THERE BE THAT FIND IT.  Even my grandfather, a fine man, a Methodist minister, was completely unable to comprehend the deeper spiritual values, and a greater understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  He preached what he was paid to preach.<//review>

Whether it's just exploring the grounds and beautiful gardens outside for free... or actually serving inside. Definitely one of the most un-regrettable places to visit in my life. <3

<Review>Why is there still a need for temples when Jesus Himself came and after His atonement there is no longer a need for temples. It is in Jesus’ death, in His destruction, and in His resurrection three days later, that Jesus meets our needs and reconciles us to God, becoming the temple, the supreme meeting-place between God and sinners.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dc06d32da29aff:0x3681ef10f8a92fa4</gmap_id><Resp>None</Resp><rating>2<//rating><user_id>105349390954664325600</user_id><name>Jayson Mallari< /name><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

I traveled to get married here and it was a dream come true. Everyone here made the best day of my life even better. They let me reschedule my sealing time and then called me back multiple times as my wedding date drew near to make sure I was prepared and all my questions were answered. They made me feel so special<//Text>

Temples of all faiths are open to the public but this one is "members" only so could not go inside. Outside grounds are very nice and very grand exteriors.</Text>

< Review>
My wife grew up believing that Love is Eternal. When she learned that family members can be together Forever by becoming Sealed to one another in the Temple, she gladly joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. We Love the San Diego California Temple. It brings us close to Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, and Heavenly Father. Our capacity to love our family and many of Heavenly Father's children increases with each Temple visit.</Review>

<Text>It is a very peaceful place to go. And for members of the church we can go do the ordinances by proxy for our ancestors.

It is also a beautiful building to view.< /Text>< username>

<Text>I went here today after a business meeting and love going here as often as I can while in the area.  It is breathtaking when you first see the temple coming south on I-5.  Once arriving on the temple grounds everything slows down and it is so peaceful and beautiful just to walk around and sit on the grounds in awe and wonder.  Our Heavenly Father loves each of us so much and wants us to come to His temples often.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc06d32da29aff:0x3681ef10f8a92fa4< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>This place is absolutelying gorgeous and definitely fits in with surrounding area.  I was here during Christmas time and they had lights all over the grounds and it was very pretty.  They also had a nice nativity that was apart of the lights to really help remember the true meaning of Christmas.  Missionaries from the church were on the grounds and very nice to answer questions and help my family take a picture.<//Text>< Pics>

Beautiful on the outside, the people around don't seem to mind visitors. Only members can attend inside.
Sometimes people may speak to you on the outside grounds but honestly they have good intentions.
Very photogenic and gives off a castle esq build.
If you want a good picture, or to see some newly-weds I would definetly recommend it as a spot.<//review>

<text>The temple is a place where I feel enlightened.  I understand the purpose of my life as I enter the doors.  It truly is Heavenly Fathers house.  Because of temples, I know that I can be with my family forever.<//text>< Pictures>

I was there for the Open House, either late 1992 or early 1993.  It was dedicated by President S. Monsen right after my baptism in 1993, I received my Endowment in the temple in 1993, hence my calling it MY TEMPLE.<//Review>

This is one of my very favorite temples. It looks like a fairy tale castle. I went to the open house twice when it was first built when I was growing up in Fontana, California. Simply breathtaking architecture and the best thing is the Spirit of Heavenly Father permeates the building and temple grounds. The House of the Lord. Holiness to the Lord.< /text>

What a beautiful temple! Its magestic and yet a place where the spirit of the Lord dwells. A place of peace, inspiration, and light to all that visit its grounds and within. It symbolizes light and truth from above in a world of confusion, stress, uncertainty and that lacks purpose, direction and meaning. Temples are a place to recharge your spiritual batteries which enables you to better live according to God's laws, to receive inspiration for the personal challenges you face in life, to remembering who you are and your relationship with the Lord, your purpose on earth, and to receive ordinances which will allow you the opportunity to be with God and the Lord and your families forever. I know it is true, I feel it in my heart and it is available to all who seek the truth.</Text>

When this temple was announced and money way raised, there was quite a period before construction began. The lot was out in the middle of nowhere across from where I had an apartment. I used to go there at night with my trumpet and play hymns. It was comforting. Though we have moved away, I have attended the temple several times. I do feel a special connection to the temple, the locale, and the people. Also, we were in the 13th Ward, that same location, which is I think now the University City 1st Ward. What a wonder place with wonderful people.< /review>

"Temple building brings increased power.  Every foundation stone that is laid for a temple, and every Temple completed according to the order the Lord has revealed for His Holy Priesthood, lessens the power of Satan on the earth and increases the power of God and Godliness."

A Hindú motel manager motivated me to visit for the first time. He knew that I'm a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and after I complimented a calendar on the office wall featuring Hindú temples, he enthusiastically told me that he'd visited my beautiful temple! I'd decided not to visit it because I thought I'd feel sad, as I didn't have a temple recommend so couldn't go inside yet. I was wrong. After arising before dawn, I took public transportation (3 buses, 90 minutes) and arrived as many of the temple workers did. I had a warm chat with one and took a few photos. I'm planning another trip when the temporary visitors center is open @ 9. :-)

UPDATE: I have since received my temple recommend and, after receiving my endowments, (during which the dear sister who was my escort was also my mother's proxy), was sealed to my late husband and parents. I was my mother's proxy for her baptism and confirmation as well as her sealing to my father and her parents, and was proxy for one of my late husband's paternal grandfather's wives for their sealing (he remarried after being widowed, but had only been sealed to one of the two). I'm DETERMINED to get familial permission to have his mother's ordinances done so his parents can be sealed and he can be sealed to them (I've had his father's other ordinances done). I have a lot to do for our ancestors!

I could hardly believe it was possible for the temple to be even more beautiful inside than outside, but it is - and, despite being right beside a major freeway, it's as quiet as those who come to such a holy place deserve for it to be. I've learned that two of its architects was a Catholic couple, and it shows. The Bride's Room is so breathtaking that I've sneaked into it a few times to enjoy its beauty and snag a few TicTacs from the bowl on the central table (and the one time I was "caught", we just [quietly] laughed!). I'm blessed to be able to go about one morning a week with sisters in my ward who carpool there to participate in initiatories. I know we retain our free agency after death, just as we had it before and after mortality, and have been blessed with impressions from some of those for whom I've been privileged to be proxy that they had embraced the gospel after death as they were unable to in life, and were grateful for the small, but necessary, role I played in their eternal progression, which was, of course, edifying for me, as well.

While I regret having not lived in such a way so as to be worthy of temple worship for far too many years, I'm grateful that I persevered and made doing so a goal. Having read accounts of the temple experiences of a few women who went on to break their covenants, forsake the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, and withdraw from the Church, I was a little nervous about going, as well as worried that what I'd read would negatively impact my own experiences. But I discussed my fears and concerns with my bishop and had a few chats with the Temple Preparation Class instructor, so nothing I read ended up making any difference to me. I merely feel sad that these women were less prepared, went under questionable circumstances, and therefore couldn't help but interpret the experience far differently.</text>

Not open to the public. Why don't they spend money on the poor instead of building expensive temples?< /Review>

The white massive building/temple off the Interstate 5 (San Diego), does draw your attention and curiousity.  I respectfully pulled off the I5 to visit the temple, but was told it is not open to the public.  So enjoy it from afar... the grounds are well kept... So is Disney.

It might be different if you are an LDS member, but the man behind the desk didn't even bother to ask.</text>

Not to mention that it is beautiful on the outside, being near the home of The Lord brings his wonderful spirit. If you have questions about going inside talk to the missionaries knocking on your door or riding their bikes around. It will change your life!<//Text>

I love the temple! People saying we need money to get in is not true. But you do need premission by doing that you need to be baptized. This is a sacred place for LDS OR Mormons. Im sad that people couldn't  answer  your questions but nobody is perfect. Since Converting to the LDS church me personal , I have grown closer to Heavenly Father and my Savior. If you need Answers about what we do in temple. Reach out to the Missionaries! 👍 may Heavenly Father continue  to bless yours lives.<//review>

I suggest everyone visit the San Diego Temple grounds this Christmas, member or not. Everyone will enjoy what they encounter, especially as the sun sets.
If you would like to learn more about how to enter the temple please visit with missionaries in your area and or speak with a member.<//Review>

Have visited this temple during vacation for baptisms and an endowment session.  It's like stepping into a giant crystal.  Beautiful temple, full of the Lord's Spirit.</Text>

There are helpful girls posted outside that answered questions and take people on tours of the grounds.  Only people with membership can go inside but it is still worth getting up close to.  Amazing building.</review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Rating a Temple experience seems a little odd in a way. For those who are LDS it is an opportunity to go to a place that is peaceful, where you feel the Holy Ghost, or Spirit of God. The San Diego Temple is a very beautiful building inside and out. It has ornate work and the craftmanship is exceptional. All of that is secondary however, to the peace one feels when doing the work of Redeeming the Dead in the House of the Lord and then reflecting on the higher purposes of life. The San Diego Temple is special to me because my wife and I were sealed there in 2000 and we entered an eternal covenant between us and the Lord. All are welcome to the grounds; however, in order to enter the temple and participate in the ordinances of the Temple one must be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in good standing and have been baptized for at least one year. That is not hard to do, but one should not do it just to enter the temple alone, but because they want a better life, focused on the Savior Jesus Christ.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Even if you can't go in, this temple is special to me just looking at it.  It looks like a beautiful castle and taking a walk on the grounds just to feel peace and love is amazing.</text>

< Review>
This building is the best. It is well built and the architecture is Astounding. I was able to go inside and the feeling inside there is pure bliss and love. Nobday looks at you funny or thinks your weird, although you might think that about them. But dont. Everyone working there is dressed in white and it matches the decor inside which is alll white as well. It is beautiful and clean and the Mormon church lives up to their name because you can truely feel the love of Jesus when your in there.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) The San Diego California Temple is a very nice building. If you drive on Interstate 5, you should get off here and spend half an hour walking around this wonder. As can be seen in the many pictures, it is probably the most beautiful in the evening.

(Translated by Google) It is an impressive temple both far and near. Its architecture is a neo-Gothic, very modern, concrete. Its gardens immaculate, and the people very friendly. What I never asked if it was a Catholic, Christian, Anglican temple or something else. What if they have the curiosity of their entrance, it is not like the classic of the temples where the door is impressive and you get inside the space of worship. In this no. Your entrance gives to a reception, after which a pair of automatic doors is opened. You're going with the modernity of the site. But the entrance is not for a temple of that magnitude.

(Original)
Es un templo impresionante tanto de lejos como de cerca. Su arquitectura es un neogótico, muy moderno, de concreto. Sus jardines inmaculada, y la gente muy amable . Lo que nunca pregunté que si era un templo católico, cristiano, anglicanos o algo más. Lo que si tienen la curiosidad de su entrada, no es como lo clásico de los templos donde la puerta es impresionante y llegas al interior del espacio de culto. En esta no. Su entrada da a una recepción, después de que se abre un par de puertas automáticas. Estás puertas va con la modernidad del sitio. Pero la entrada no es para un templo de esa magnitud.< /text>
