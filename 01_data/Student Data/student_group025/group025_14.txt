<review>These guys are great. They arrive on time and do their work quickly and efficiently with excellent results. We also had them clean high traffic tiled areas and reseal the grout. Now it looks like new tile again! It's no wonder we've been using them for nearly 30 years.< /review>< Time>

<username>Robin Overstreet<//username><review>We just had our carpets cleaned and Service Master was great. Called last week and was able to get them in yesterday. They showed up right on time, were friendly, efficient and answered all my questions. They even charged LESS than their quote because we moved a lot of the furniture ahead of time. And my carpets look amazing! Would highly recommend!<//review>< rate>

This should be called “miracle”carpet cleaning. I had some extreme spots in the carpet after some construction projects, plus other old spots. Service Master got every one of them out. My carpet is 24 years old and now looks very close to new. I am beyond happy with the outstanding job they did!!</text>

<text>I called ServiceMaster of the Desert, spoke with Leslie and told her that I wanted all the carpets cleaned in the entire house.  She asked some questions, and having been to our house before, gave me a quote over the phone.  Two technicians showed up at the agreed upon time, and the rest is history.  They did a fabulous job.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Brad did an excellent job on the carpets. But what I particularly appreciate is the extras. Tucking in the bed skirts so they wouldn’t absorb any moisture,  turning on the fans for quick drying ( I was not home) and  ring extra considerate of the home. Lesslie was great in setting the appointment at short notice. Highly recommend.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I was extremely satisfied with the work done by the technician ServiceMaster sent to my home for carpet cleaning.  He was polite, professional and called to ask if he could come early for the appointment.    Also when I called to enquire about the cleaning, they were able to make an appointment in a timely manner.
Thank you Steve & Leslie, I would most definitely recommend this business to anyone needing carpet cleaning in their home.< /text>

I highly recommend Service Masters! My first impression of booking my appt through Lesli was the beginning of a seamless process. She is knowledgeable, professional & thorough. They are tech savvy in keeping their customers informed & reminded of future appointments.
Steve arrived on time, went above & beyond to meet our carpet cleaning needs & the pricing was very fair. It’s wonderful to know there’s still quality, locally owned companies that really care about the exceptional work they do for homeowners and companies alike. Thank you to the community on the NextDoor App for referring Service Masters!< /Text>

Service Master of Palm Desert came to clean up my rug & did my kitchen for free 😍.  I have just acquired a small dog and I was happily surprised how my rug looked after they steamed cleaned my carpet.  The guys called to see if they could start working on my rug one hour early, which I LOVED. I was truly amazed how beautiful my rug looked. I would recommend Service Master to anyone that has an issue with their rugs.

Also hired them recently to clean  water stains off our upholstered sofa -- again, what a fabulous job.  They showed up very promptly and are very courteous and professional each time.  I highly recommend ServiceMaster Of The Desert.  I do not write many reviews, but this company deserves five stars.<//text>< userid>

<review>This was my first experience with Service Master of the Desert. Steve and Leslie were extremely responsive to my calls and questions. Due to Covid-19, we had to reschedule a few times. The work was completed last week. It looks like we have a brand new home. The floors look amazing.

I would highly recommend this business.< /review></record>

They are always mindful  and respectful for our home. I was so impressed to see they protected my wall corners with a fitted  cone. Believe me , that goes a long way with someone with a Type A personality! I love that they use long time employees and not " random subs"... Thank you, ServiceMaster!!</Text>

Wouldn’t use anyone else for carport &/ window cleaning in the Coachella Valley!
Have been a satisfied customer of Service Master of the Desert for 25 yrs.
Lesli & her crew do an amazing job , are accommodating & always prompt.
She’s taken care of my two units in Palm Springs and is one of the rare business owners that stands behind her work. I wish I could take her w me on my move.
Will not disappoint ;)<//Text>

Steve, the owner, took over my project. Besides being professional and timely, he’s most courteous and truthful in not wanting to attempt to clean an item as he didn’t feel it would make a significant difference.

The cleaning team arrived on time.  They viewed the area to be cleaned and determined the best entrance.  Hoses were brought in and all bedroom carpets were washed in a mannerly way.  The carpets dried the next day.  We were very pleased with results.</Text>

Steve, the owner showed up early with a prior text message letting me know he was in route. He did a fantastic job on our carpets that were very dirty from
Sweet 90 lb Labrador. I will definitely be using them again!< /review>

Always use Service Master to power wash, clean windows, screens, mirrors at our two homes in Rancho Mirage. They are the best window service I have ever dealt with.</text>

My service was the upmost  professional job that we have had in such a long time!

ServiceMaster of the Desert did a fantastic job cleaning my windows. Steve and Brad were prompt, thorough, and completely professional. Windows and doors are spotless and look amazing. Also, the amount of communication (for confirmations, reminders and updates) from the time I made the appointment until the job was complete is perfect. I highly recommend the company. Thank you!<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>These guys are super heroes!  I moved into a new office and the landlord's crew had cleaned the floors but it was still so filthy.  I called Servicemaster of the Desert and they had a cancellation with enough time to do a great job.  They steam cleaned and polished my cement floors so that the floor looks great - and it's really clean.  They were very careful with my stuff and worked quickly to get the job done! Thank you so much!< /text><Resp>{'time': 1568746486833, 'text': 'Thanks Kathy! Always wanted to be a super hero.'}< /Resp>< user_id>

Kids love this place. Multiple areas to play.  Nice wide open grassy areas for multiple uses.  Little area for the kids to get wet in. Little spout, but the 6 and unders will have a blast.< /Text>

These guys had a good attitude with a beginner like me.  The price is what it is, pretty much everywhere. So the big difference is service = their good attitude.

Not a super fancy place, some of the staff can be a little dry sometimes, but certainly not rude.  This place serves its purpose well, prices seem reasonable, seem to be open lanes when I go, they seem to take safety seriously but not in a tension causing manner.  Nice balance of diligence and accommodation.  Good to go.< /text>

I was getting set to join the club to go shooting because they have perks for members. The range was okay, seemed typical for a few that I have been to over the years which isn't many but it doesn't take a whole lot to figure it out.
The staff however is a bit on the 'pithy' side. Two or maybe three conversations on the phone left me not feeling like I want to join. Mind you, it is a financial commitment, aka, not cheap.
On the positive note, the help at the range was good. At least, the one time I was there. I will continue to shop as the California legislature makes it impossible to shoot or buy ammo. Too bad the service didn't leave me with the feeling of wanting to get more serious. On the other hand, maybe it is better off. I will use my cell phone for help and then throw my phone at the perpetrator.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dbffb2b82ab841:0x30361dd2c94a52b4</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<user>109815985640440485788</user><Review>I went here just to inquire about getting a new membership, but the staff was so friendly and helpful that I ended up buying a handgun at the same time.  The staff was knowledgeable and explained to me all about gun legalities in California.  I would definitely recommend this place not only for target practice, but for sales and services as well.< /Review><Name>Gerald Cortez<//Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><date>1450803068158</date>< response>

Take safety very serious (which is a good thing).  Reasonably priced, glad they had rentals (pistols and rifles).  Clean, efficient, and friendly.  Enjoyed our shoot that day!< /Review>

I like this place to shoot during the week and after work. Prices are not bad, safety is stressed but shoved down your throat. The gun selection is very limited compared to my previous visits to the store.<//Text>

Not only a great gun range, but a classic -- perfect. Old, nondescript building, nothing fancy, but everything you'd need or want. Fourteen lanes, good assortment of range guns for rental, outstanding staff with a significant depth of knowledge. This is a place to treasure, it's that good. Other gun ranges are imitations of ASC.< /Text>

I WENT IN TO THIS GUN SHOP 3 YEARS AGO WITHOUT MUCH EXPERIENCE AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE EDUCATION THEY PROVIDED ME. I NOW FEEL I CAN HANDLE A FIREARM SAFELY AND WITH CONFIDENCE. I HAVE SINCE THEN BEEN TO MULTIPLE GUN SHOPS AROUND FROM SAN DIEGO TO ORANGE COUNTY AND THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST PROFESSIONAL AND POLISHED GUN STORES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I CONTINUE TO SHOP HERE FOR MY FIREARMS AND I JUST RECENTLY GOT A MEMBERSHIP. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ASC TO EVERYONE WHO LOVES GUNS AND ESPECIALLY YOUNG ENTHUSIAST WHO ARE GETTING INTO THE HOBBY.<//text>

This "one star" is based upon today's terminal negative experience.  The experience of the previous 6+ years is more like "4, then increasing slightly over several years."   Helpful staff.  Staff had continually improved as they finally got rid of some of the rude long time employees.

I have been buying an annual membership at ASC for six years, renewing each June.  I recently renewed in mid June, 2017, for the beginning of the 7th year.

I had recently been to the range at ASC for target shooting, about 10 days or possibly 2 weeks ago.

Wednesday, Sept 6, 2017, I arrived at ASC to find a gutted building !!   Not even a sign on the door, which would tell customers, and paid members, about this sudden, unannounced closure.

Then I called the ASC phone number, only to reach a non-message voice mail which said nothing at all about what has taken place.

No previous indication that they were soon to be shutting down business, even though I was there recently.   ASC ownership has skipped out.

ASC should return a pro-rated remainder of the money they charged me for a one year membership. ASC took money for my membership, which they had no intention of fulfilling.

Disabled Vet, with multiple physical problems, on a fixed low income.

ASC should be honest and forthright, by not avoiding responsibility for problems their abrupt actions cause.

Don't skip out - - and give me back my money.

Vanguard has great service, reasonable prices and gets the job done quick. I was having a problem with my laptop and Bladen was able to figure out what was wrong with it within a short period of time. They work fast and are a very professional and reliable company. I will definitely return to them in the future if I were to have anymore problems.<//Review>

<text>Not a very communicative places. I dropped my MacBook off to them, they told me they were going to call me and they never did, I had to called them in the afternoon to see what was going on. All they said it’s going to be very expensive to fix and that it’s hard to fix it. When they said that i didn’t even bother to ask for prices. When I picked up my MacBook they were trying to give me an Old masts macbook charger. Mine was new, I bought a day before dropping it off. It was an insult to me what they did<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_3md-G3U9GV1l-f3iYwA_8CTTfBwctNNxiNZB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNX4cn7j3-bzYwjiM5Y_4ATKCt-k3KtPh9gGb0_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYQoyRzRgdoYOAbS68gP8JnaHfRL-QMO_FBZ7z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMT7148LBUv8Z0OHAXnKQl9ggEUHj9bSKd4iWPZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1YJYnVgp93elak2xVnesRIihxIYaMjy62W0bS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiuAdxCi4MEdDXHdAsK0mUtgWUh6dhhbs4-buE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFC6ci8Sc83KBbozed82sUBsHoB2Q_pfcRW7HS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNb659KtgaUO1a3rTwdYwHMiIS5taGoEIIJ3mRS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2qVE19RsD-eFhtioBAr5msACl2-TFWcQ4MPCO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1554582897226, 'text': 'Hello,\nI do apologize for what happened to you I have looked into the issue and am having trouble finding when you can in.

These guys are miracle workers!!
I thought I had lost all my family photos when I accidentally drove over my laptop in my driveway!
Next it was able to salvage and recover my family memories and load them onto a flash drive for me.
Additionally they helped me get some cloud storage so I can know my memories will always be safe.
Thanks Vanguard!!<//review>

He continues to give us honest and reliable solutions for everything from software to hardware needed to keep our company running at all times. Highly recommend Vanguard Solutions< /Text>

<Text>Internet connection hardware problem with my OLD and SLOW laptop.  It was not worth repairing the clunker, so asked for advice. Vanguard was able to salvage my hard drive and all programs and files and transfer to a MUCH BETTER and FASTER laptop  for a very reasonable price. Recommend this company highly for your computer repairs!  Thank you.  Paul Martin< /Text>< pictures>

Thanks Vanguard! Great staff, great service, Just great! I had a really frustrating issue with my desktop and I tried all solutions I could find, but nothing would work. I decided to find a place to help me out and I am glad I went with Vanguard. They where very professional they kept me up to date. If I ever have any other problems in the future I will not hesitate to go back to Vanguard and I definitely recommend to go to them if your having issues with your computer, they will get the job done. Thank again Vanguard.<//Review>

The greatest experience when repairing my laptop. The service was BEYOND amazing. I had researched what it might cost to replace my hard drive and it was hundreds at other big places whereas vanguard only charged me $150. I was beyond relieved and it was replaced in 24 hours. The men and women here are so friendly and helpful and I really appreciated the way that they explained the process without making me feel "dumb". I will be coming back with any problems I might have.< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Vanguard was by far the best decision I've made. Walked with my Macbook Pro with a messed up battery and with tons of problems that made my computer run slow. They fixed everything within a couple of days! Got a new battery, they clean the inside of the computer which was filled up with tons of dust and other debris, and had my laptop running like band new! Definitely recommend this place to anyone with computer issues!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>We have had Will, and Vanguard Solutions, work on our network and computers for about 3 years now.  They are very knowledgeable, professional and courteous.  We can not do business when our computers are down, so if and when that happens, Will is extremely accessible.  He is prompt and gets us up and working in a very short time.  We have recommended Will, and his company, to many friends and colleagues.</Review>< Pics>

We are a physician's office that needed IT help urgently and Vanguard did a great job coming in and setting up systems and securing our setup. They successfully set up a wireless network to stream video to multiple TVs which was technologically quite challenging. Will is a pleasure to work with.< /Review>

<Text>Whether you use your computer at work, or work from home, it's key to have someone you can trust, to help you if your computer gets malware, or worse. I trust Bladen from Vanguard Solutions. They are reasonably priced, got both my computers fixed and returned within 1.5 days, they follow up after the fix, and guarantee  their work after it's completed. I Strongly recommend Vanguard Solutions Covina if you need your Computer fixed!<//Text>< pics>

<review>Awesome! All I wanted was a computer check up to see which part was broken, everywhere else wanted to charge $300 just to LOOK at it. I like how you can be specific. They work with you here and really give a fair price for what you're looking for and not tie you down with some overpriced package. When I dropped off and picked up the PC they were very friendly I was able to solve my problem very easily. Id choose this place over anyone else next time I have a computer problem. Seriously if you're in the area choose them!< /review><rating>5< /rating><response>{'time': 1476733776495, 'text': 'TY so Much please come down and visit our new office!'}< /response><time>1413956123976<//time><UserId.>102695206073118831182</UserId.></record>

This place should be everyone's one stop shop for every computer problem you may encounter. The hours of operation are early morning and late evening and availability of a computer tech is almost immediate. The location is easy to find and the price is more than reasonable. The quality of customer service is phenomenal. Without a doubt I will be coming here again. I would  recommend this place  to everyone and anyone. My laptop is once again brand new; What should have have taken days to complete, my laptop was finished within hours and it didn't cost me an arm and leg!!Couldn't be happier.<//Text>

I had the best experience.... I am "computer dumb" and they explained everything no matter how ridiculous my questions and fears were. They diagnosed the problem on my MacBook Pro, then consulted on what to do or buy, and then set-up my new MacPro so I could understand it ..!Never did my consultant rush me or not answer my calls..I will recommend BLADE TECHNOLOGIES  every chance I can. P.S. the best part --they are unbelievably reasonable---such a GEM!!!!!!!</Text>

<Review>The logic board on my macbook pro went out so I was looking for a place  to replace it . A google search later, i'm emailing Vanguard with questions about services after their posted hours. Not 2 min go by when I got an email from Bladen (Not sure on the spelling) telling me that they do the repair i'm looking for and that he would call me the next day. A few days later, I drop the computer off. After some diagnostic work, they call me up with options and we go from there. A week later, I've got my machine back. He even stayed later than closing time so I could pick it up. Great service, great customer service and very competitive pricing. I'll certainly will be back!</Review></record>

I absolutely love this Thrift store and everything they stand  for. It is clean and organized and they adhere to all the covid 19 restrictions. The best part of all though is that they give all of their proceeds to the upland Valley animal shelter.❤< /Text>

So my first time in this store was last week: and aside of them having literally the most amazing stuff donated the staff is EXTREMELY NICE & HELPFUL! Every single person that works there keeps a smile on their face and makes sure you’re taken care of. The prices are also insanely low! Ive been able to redecorate my house in a rustic farmhouse look with almost everything from here! Because of this, I’m in this place 2-3 times a week now!<//text>

I love this thrift store! It's a very big size store this store supports Upland animal shelter! They lost their city funding and the store he brings a lot of Revenue in for them! If you have things that you need to get rid of or need to have them picked up or you just want to go shopping it's a great place to go I recommend it highly<//text>

<review>They would help their cause more if their prices were lower. Like most thrift stores these days, they are way overpriced for things that they get for free.

I'm not asking for a handout - but they don't even budge. Yes, the proceeds do go to a great cause,but like I said,they would sell a lot more if they would ease up on the prices...<//review>< pics>

<Review>I really want to do more of my thrift shopping here as the profits go to support the Upland Humane Society, but the selection just isn't that extensive. They do have a few hidden bargains, but like all thrift stores, it is hit or miss.  Employees were friendly and helpful<//Review>< pictures>

<review>I like this shop because the proceeds benefit the Upland Animal Shelter.  I don't mind paying whatever they charge, although the have special discounts Monday thru Thursday, as well as daily color tag discounts.  Sometimes it's hard to find parking, their lot is small and there aren't any legal spots within walking distance.< /review><GmapID>0x80c331912f2c710f:0xda6e49f210bf97c< /GmapID><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

<review>Quality stuff for reasonable prices. My mom comes here atleast once a week and when ever I am down visiting we come here and loose ourselves in the store lol. I would of gave this store 5 stars but I didn't due to only 1 employee. On 2 occasions she rang my mother and I up and was very short tempered and made us feel like she was superior and we were ignorant. I wont get into details of the situation but she was very rude and I will never forget these both interactions with her because no matter when we come in it seems like she has a chip on her shoulder with everyone. She has a cute short haircut with pink in it. We love this store and everyone else is super sweet and helpful that's why we come back but we just pray Shes not there when we do.</review><resp>None<//resp><Date>1523924220715</Date><GmapID>0x80c331912f2c710f:0xda6e49f210bf97c< /GmapID><UserId.>116703417801615088360<//UserId.><username>Jennifer Ortiz<//username></record></dataset><record>

Thrift shop run by the Friends of Upland Animal Shelter.  Typical selection of items for sale, donations accepted.  Pricing is sometimes a little sketchy and the staff doesn't always seem able to put together items that clearly belong together (making you pay for each part).< /Review>

Very caring doctors and nurses. Staff is well informed and explains to pet owners how to care for their pets. I have been taking my pets to Shield Stone pet hospital for over 13 years. I highly recommend.</Text>

These folks are amazing. Very safe and convenient handling of covid safety concerns. And they always care so well for my Honeydew. Though one of the docs kept calling her a him, which was a little confusing.</Review>

<review>One of my poor little dogs has a back problem but this vet office has been so great through all of it. We have been using this vet for all of our dogs and I really appreciate the care that the staff has for all the animals. Will continue to come here for any vet needs.<//review>< name>

We have trusted them with our doggies for over 5 years. They are always helpful and professional.
Today was the same, except extra Covid precautions. We are thankful for their help when we are frantic.
We recommend Shield Stone Pet Hospital to everyone that needs their help.< /text>

< Review>
I've taken my dog, Tyson, here for several years and their care for him has always been exemperly and their customer service exellent.  We've never had to wait long.   Today I had to have Tyson euthanized and they were very gentle and supportive of both of us.  They took the time to explain everything and I would strongly recommend them to you.</Review>

< review>
Our fur baby "Cash" has some constipation issues.  A dear friend of mine referred me to them........BEST Referral ever.  We took our dog in for exam and treatment.  Staff are so very kind and compassionate.  I would like to recognize employee Valerie.  We had to take our fur baby to 24/7 Vet last night due to his disc disease.  Medications were ordered at the ER....a little expensive.  I contacted Valerie at Shield Stone to let her know what happened last night with Cash.  She has Beautiful Heart and was so compassionate and understanding.  She made contact w/ me this morning with not only a better price for the meds, she made sure I had a few until other meds were filled.  She totally went above and beyond her call of duty.  She is a Blessing to your Hospital.  Thank you Valerie for your Love, Compassion and Understanding during this emotional time for us with our fur baby.  Thank You Dr. Shim for your kindness, patience when you examined Cash last year,  God Bless All Of You at Shield Stone Pet Hospital.

Sincerely,

Sharon Marzette

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>I simply wanted a price range, not a quote, for a procedure for my pet. They won’t give you anything until you spend $85 on an exam. Most folks can’t afford to hand over that much money to hear they can’t afford the procedure. Why is it so impossible to just give a ballpark number so I can immediately decide. They seem to care more about money than your pet. Shameful.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Text>They're not always on time with their scheduling. Like having to wait 10-15min after the appointed time of arrival BUT the service is professional and friendly. Cheap pricing for most of their services and they always use the latest technology available. Love this place!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< Review>
I will not take my animals anywhere else. I’ve used a lot of vets and Shieldstone is the real deal! One of the main reasons I love Shieldstone is the staff!! The girls are always so nice and friendly. They treat my dogs as if they are their own. I always feel comfortable leaving my animals with Shieldstone if they have a surgery or procedure done. Dr. Shim is also great! Same thing, he always treats my animals like they are his. Just good vibes all around. Thank you for always taking good care of my animals :)</Review>

We have always been treated great by the staff! Dr Yo, that is what we called him, was so good with our Jack Russell, Happy! She loved going to see him. She started going to him when she was about 8 weeks old. She lived to be 18 years old! Everyone there has been wonderful & the new vet was so good with her when we had to put her to sleep. She is so kind & caring, she was there with us thru every step of the way & made us feel so much better about what we had to do for our baby. We had her cremated & have her in a little gold box, with her picture on it.
They are all wonderful people to deal with!<//Review>

These guys are amazing. My dog was sick not eating for 3 days. I tried to feed her before i went to the vet and nothing. Soon as we walked in i gave her a treat and she nibbled at it a bit. But i was just happy to c that. Long story short the vet checked her.and gave me medication and the next day she was coming around. Now shes 100.Thanks shield stone. U guys are the best< /text>

<review>I have been taking my three pets to this place for 15 yrs. When my one dogs, who was 15 yrs old, had to be euthanized, Shield Stone was completely unsympathetic or understanding. They wanted me to just drop off my dog. So, although they gave my  pets pretty  good care for most of the time, their handling of my experience when I had to put my beloved pet to sleep, was inexcusable and lacked any sense of empathy. It is why I have decided to switch vets.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Also, office visits are very affordable and my dogs medication was cheap as well. The doctor was great!

The friendly staff got us (well, our two cats) checked in and seen promptly and quickly. They also give good multi-pet discounts of $20 off of the $45 exam fee for each pet after the first.< /review>

Took my friend to have his cat put down, and while we were quickly ushered into an exam room(we had an appointment), the amount of time they left us sitting in the exam room was extreme - after waiting for 15 minutes I  left my friend to go get gas and McDonald's,  came back, and he said someone had come in one time while I was gone and told him it should only be another minute or two. Another 15 minutes went by before they even got the patient info from us. Toooooo long to be sitting in a place that smells like, well, an animal hospital. Don't  know what I expected, but I was not impressed.<//Review>

<Text>Took my dog 3 times for various needs and every time she was treated very kindly as were we.  Both vets we got to see were very sweet and calm.  The exam fee is affordable and so are the medications.  I definitely recommend this place.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Good place to go if your pet is sick or injured.Offers a variety of services.Also offers end of life service. Such services are cremation, burial or whatever you decide on. Staff is very friendly and is willing to work with you as well as give you suggestions and prices. I was very happy with my cremation selection and I highly recommend Stone Shield Pet Hospital 4 A1 Services.<//Review><user_id>112348037241528890459< /user_id><Rating>5</Rating>< Resp>

My dog is currently battling cancer and kidney failure. The staff here have been great at helping me and my dog get through this. They keep prices reasonable. As much as my dog has to go there for procedures, he is always happy to jump in the car to see them.< /review>

I found this place because of my son. This place has appointments and if you have an appointment you are certainly called quickly. Everyone is so kind and caring. My Cookies now has his own pet-iatrician.< /Review>

When Dr. Yoo was around, this place was great.  The new vets are inept in their care and horrible in their customer service.  I had a boy dog who went through some rough medical issues last year before passing away.
A wait of an hour or more after my appointment time was not unusual.

They told me to come in with my very sick girl dog at 10:30 this morning for x-rays.  Once there, they told me they couldn't look at her until after lunch.  Then why have me come in at 10:30?  I told them I was done for good.  I asked for my dog's file and they REFUSED to give it to me (the law says they HAVE to get it to me).  They were butt-hurt because I was leaving, so they wanted to complicate things for me today.  I eventually got the file.  I'm going to complain to the state board Monday morning.<//Review>

<review>Took my dog here because she was pretty bad to the point where I didn't think she'd make another day they didn't do walk ins but I told them her conditions and took me in the same day they really were very caring and did whatever to help her , even had me taking her in so they can check up on her status , my dog is now recovering and looking better I really recommend this place , they are affordable compared to other places I've thought of taking her, wait time isn't long at all , staff is very nice and caring , I can say I really am grateful for all them 🖒 will be coming here for all my dogs for sure!<//review>< time>

<Review>I will not take my animals to a vet that won't allow me in the room when they give shots, nail clippings or other non surgical procedures.  I could not verify what they did or what extras they were trying to charge me for.  I could verify they clipped his nails.  I don't know if they clipped all of them.  They lost my trust.<//Review>< response>

Prices aren't insane, however you can NOT join your pet when he's getting shots, groomed, checked up on, etc. You wait in the lobby, quite a long time usually, but the job gets done with care and I've never seen them mistreat an animal.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>They've been the best for every dog and cat I've ever had very the last 20 years. I've had several dogs that were themselves disabled, some severely disabled and the Drs worked with me to keep all of them alive and thriving for more years than my fur-kids would have had. Currently Dip-Stick(16+yrs) starting to lose his sight. Tri-Pod(6+yrs) born with 5legs but only walks on 3 legs. The pointers and techniques they given me have enabled my kids to live long and healthy lives. If a dog is man's best friend these people are a dogs best friend. Bry Jameson< /text>< pics>

This is my second time here and I love it! The staff is friendly and helpful. I could tell that they are geuinely concerned for your pets. I never have to wait, I am always in and out within 20- 30minutes(appointment needed). I used to take my dogs to a Vet in Clovis that would charge me double the money, so happy I found this place! Their prices are very affordable and competitve. I had a younger asian male Dr help me with my 16 yr old pup and he listened to my concerns and didn't rush me out the door like some vets do. My dogs are always happy to come here. Love this place, can't say enough good things about this place. Thank you</Review>

Very poor experience so far. Ordered two closet doors through home depot. We received both doors, but only one track? And the track we did receive is an inch longer than the doors it is supposed to fit and won't fit in the closet enclosure without being cut. Well, I don't have a metal saw so I can't install this door. I've purchased many closet doors in my life and never had the track be longer than the door or opening. I called Home Depot who called these guys and were told that they always ship tracks that are longer than the door. This sounds ridiculous to me. I'm still waiting for the other track which  I can supposedly call next Tuesday to get a "tracking number", meaning, I probably won't get my track until a few weeks after the doors. Last time I do business with this company and Home Deport. Exceptionally poor experience. I am seeking a way to return all of the products for a refund once the missing track appears.

UPDATE: Here we are, over a month and a half since I ordered the doors, and I STILL DON'T HAVE THE TRACK TO MY 72' door. I have been flat out lied to, told they were shipped, only to find out nothing has been sent. I have been told they were on their way over three times and they never never showed up. I was told today that Keona, the person who promised Home Depot last week that my order would be delivered to my house last Friday, did not include my address or phone number on the shipping log which is why they couldn't deliver. Either that is another very ridiculous lie, or Keona should not be working in this kind of position given that a shipping address would seem like a pretty obvious thing that would be needed for a delivery, no? My god, this company is a joke@!<//review>

I purchased a shower doors in 2006.  They have been very good and durable.  Wear and tear had cracked some washers for the knobs and yellowed some plastic door bumpers.  When I contacted CW to purchase some replacement parts.  CW took my information, made sure it was what I had and needed, then sent - AT NO CHARGE, even after 14 years of use - a hardware kit that had knobs and parts with new new designs.
They make the shower doors look even better.< /review>

Their customer service is very nice and I cannot understand there still are many negative reviews. My specialist, Michelle T., is efficient, helpful and friendly. She answered my repairing questions with professional details so I benefited from it a lot. Contractors Wardrobe gave me a very nice repairing experience when I felt stressed-out as I needed to repair a sliding door. Home Depot provides the special order service for this vendor and Home Depot's service is awesome, too.<//Review>

<review>The customer service with this place is absolutely horrid. I ordered my shower doors through these guys and when I asked for instructions for my contractor what they sent wasn't even for the unit I purchased. I repeated my request several times only to be told that's all they have. I have had three contractors refuse to install these doors without better instructions. The unit itself doesn't even have enough screwed to hold all of the u-channels in place. The pictures on their website aren't what you are actually ordering (it showed brackets). I've been hung out to dry by this company. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM!!</review>< Pictures>

I would give them less than 1 star if I could. They can't get ANYTHING right! They have some products that we can"'t get from others. We never have a good experience with this company. They throw a lot of paper work at you and get the glass wrong anyway. If you need to buy from expect to wait for 2 to 3 weeks!!!!!! Been on hold for 20 minutes!!!! This company is terrible!!!<//Review>

Past employee and i can grantee they do not care if they give you damaged product to them it just another day of getting money. Doors and glass are used with cheaper materials before they were good materials to make them but now the company only want to make profits. This type of behavior shouldn't be allowed especially when they still charge the same rate for an inferior product.< /text>

<review>In July 2017 we bought a shower enclosure manufactured by Contracters Wardrobe.
After several weeks, we noticed calcium deposits on the outside of the corner post.  See attached pictures.
Water is seeping through the manufactures frame splice joint and shows up as calcium on the outside of the shower!
After many e-mails and phone calls, between the 3 parties, the representative from Contractors Wardrobe, Chad Saunders, wrote the following statement to the Installer:
Nick,
I have done an inspection on this shower and from everything I can see the shower was installed and manufactured correctly.  I have brought back pictures and videos to management at my company and the shower seems to be working as designed.  The problems that the customer is concerned about does not fall under our warranty.  I believe that we may just be running into expectation problems.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you.
Chad Saunders.
Our expectation was having a shower enclosure where no water is seeping through the frame, if this is not a warranty issue, what part of the Enclosure do they warranty?
Perhaps we should have suspected future problems since the first day of installation of the enclosure, the installer had some of the frame up and due to the manufactures mistake, all the frame sections were removed, wrapped up and returned because the corner post was the incorrect size.  When the installer returned at a later date and reinstalled the shower enclosure, the top corner frame had a noticeable 1/8 inch gap.  See attached picture.  The installer was able to make the gap not so noticeable, so that we could accept the installation, but the gap is now very noticeable from the inside of the shower.  Per our installer, this is an ongoing Contractors Wardrobe problem.
As customers we have been very patient with these people, allowing them to rectify their mistakes, but it has run out, especially when they tell us they don't guarantee non-leakage.
This will be the last time we will deal with Contractors Wardrobe and for sure, they will get no recommendations!</review><name>Edgar Rastede< /name><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

I've had my large sliding mirror closet doors installed for quite a while. And I've always been  happy with them. I have a bathroom remodel in progress, and being that the doors are in fairly good shape I wanted to keep them. I was able to remove them,  make adjustments, and clean to the point where they look like new. The only other item I could use was replacing the sliders up top. I contacted support and they were easy and a pleasure to work with in getting them replaced. Any closet doors I replace in the future will be with these guys.<//text>

I ordered a neo shower enclosure through Home Depot that purchased it from Contractors Wardrobe. The sketch that Home depot used and sent to the company showed dimensions at the outside of the bottom curb/sill. Bottom dimensions given were 16 1/2 inches for both side pieces and      26 1/2 inches for the bottom curb door width piece. They provided 16 3/4" pieces and 27" for the bottom curb/sill. The headed pieces were cut to 17 13/16" and 27 1/8". These dimensions place the curb/sill at the very outside edge of the shower dam. I called the number provided in the installation instructions concerning the measurement's talked with Angela she said I would be called. No called received, went to Home depot rep. Alonna called CW and was told the company would do nothing. I've been a machinist for 35 years and the shower dam is very square and if the sketch dimensions would have been followed the
enclosure would be installed already. But they want me to hacksaw it to fit. They don't stand behind their product. Would definitely not recommend this company.< /review>

<Text>Strongly advocate purchasing from another vendor; this company is not worth the headaches.  Ordered two standard tub enclosures on June 7th, today is August 8th, and I still do not have a completed order. Received the initial order July 25th (48 days later), but metal work was incorrect size. Reordered same day, metal arrived August 8th scratched/damaged. Reordered again same day, and I have no idea when it will arrive. Most likely another two weeks to wait. Not to mention time and gas back and forth to the home improvement store to reorder/pick-up etc. If the order arrives correctly, then total wait time would equate to about 75 days, or Jun. 7 - Aug. 22? You've been warned.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

HomeDepot very nicely contacted this vendor and they shipped another track which we rec'd promptly.  Naturally, the mirrors were dusty and flecked with the styrofoam beads from packing.  Once installed and cleaned both doors were coated with blue paint overspray from something not connected to these doors.  Photos were taken and Matthew from this company was called to investigate how this happened in the shop.  After giving him order numbers etc., he wanted my husband to do all the calling to investigate.  He seemed unwilling to actually do his job.  Shouldn't be in Customer Service. Period.  Because this overspray wasn't seen until after the doors were installed, WE need to deal with trying to get the paint off from all over the doors.  We are NOT happy and would not recommend this product with shipping cost us close to $650.00.<//Review></record>

They act as a 3rd party and have Contractors Wardrobe make the shower doors and glass. When it arrive both the glass door and glass sides were the wrong size. It was reordered and when arrived the second time the side glass was correct but the door was still the wrong size. I was told it would be reordered and in by Nov 12th but only the hardware came in. Again I was told today Nov 16th it would be reordered and here by Friday the 20th. this has been going on for 7 weeks now and no one seems to be able to get it correct. When ordering glass shower doors ask who the manufacture is and if it this company you would be smart to look somewhere else<//Text>< Pictures>

Recently went back to this salon for a pedicure first and then a week later for a manicure, had a male manicurist with a high-pitched voice.  He mauled me both times, drawing blood, and it hurt like hell during and after.  Did not see sterilized instruments in a sealed packet, nor did he use alcohol to sterilize my wounds! Do not go to this salon as you risk infection and god knows what else!<//Review>

<UserId.>114158503677487589428</UserId.><text>I’ve been coming to this nail salon for years. Recently, their work and customer service has been lacking. I was there 3 times in less than a week to fix my dip manicure. I got it done on 6/29. I called the salon first to explain why I was coming, the manicure was chipping off on 6/30; Ben answered. They fixed it. Then the dip was so fragile and it was popping off throughout the week. It was the 4th of July. They were closed on that day to call and tell them about it. I ended up going on Friday, 7/5. I called in the morning. Ben answered. He said yes come. As they were finishing up the manicure. And I thought he was going to be understanding and have pride in having happy customers. And apologize for the inconvenience. And take care of me. But instead I’m being charged. Ben was uncooperative and unprofessional. He just kept saying, “I don’t know what you mean, I don’t know what you mean...”  it was a back and forth conversation. It wasn’t going anywhere. Horrible customer service and no type of communication. I do not recommend coming here.<//text><Rate>1<//Rate></record>

<text>DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU VALUE YOUR HYGIENE.

So, I was a walk in for a regular manicure and pedicure. I did my pedicure first, they rushed through it and also caused an ingrown nail. However, the worst part of it was the manicure. I sit down for the manicure and I notice that the tools the manicurist has to do my manicure STILL HAVE SOMEONE'S LEFT OVER SKIN ON THEM.
I did not ask for the manicurist's name, but she sits at station 5.
Completely unacceptable.

Please. Go somewhere else!< /text>< pictures>

No thank you, went with friend for a pedi. She asked if they could do something on the nail and the first person didn't answer so she asked the person I one I  was to have. She got a yes. Oh no, it was a terrible job. She gave attutide to the client when it was brought to her attention that she forgot to  Massage the other leg. I couldn't believe she dist her in front of both of us. Don't need this, won't be back.< /Review>

< review>
I went Into this shop My grandmother dropped me off because she was going to get my nails done for my birthday coming up. I tell Them my grandma will be coming back and paying I’m 17 years old my birthday is 2 days away so when I go To a nail shop I want To be pampered and enjoy myself and it turned into a stressful and discriminative experience.
After getting my toes done the man the manager doing my nails  told me he would not paint my nails until he was paid after I had already said that my grandmother was going to come back and pay for my nails as a birthday gift.  After I started complaining to him he started painting my nails him and one of his employees was going back-and-forth with me trying to tell me that that was just their policy when I’ve been to so many nail shops San Diego LA etc. and you don’t pay until after your nails are done and dried then you pay at the front. I was Wearing relaxed clothes no makeup and hair in a messy bun Im a mixed female and felt discriminated the shop was full of women getting there nails done none has paid before getting them painted but he was insisting I did when the row of females to my side were getting them done and painted no problem terrible first experience my nails and toes look great but to feel discriminated and your nail pampering experience is completely ruined it makes you never want to come back and I will Not be returning to this establishment again everything was handled very very unprofessionally and the experience has ruined my whole day 2 days before my 18th birthday<//review>

I have been going to this place for about 3 years. Usually haveing a good experience with my main girl, but not so much with the front guy , Ben. He likes to tell me how I'm going to do my nails. He is rude, unprofessional, and quite honestly sucks in customer service. He forgets about the paying customer and instead wants to boss around the staff.
Wont return....<//Review>

This is the best place I have been to In The Valley. Their prices are great and the customer service is really good. I am very happy almost every single time and the one time I wasn't, I went back in and ask them to fix it and they gladly helped me out< /Review>

I really don't recommend getting your nails done here. I got a Gel manicure which should of lasted 2 weeks and instead only lasted 2 days I went back they where very unprofessional they kept cursing in their language I will never go back to this place!!!! I don't like to ever complain but I spend alot of money that day to only be treated bad.< /Review>

Having just moved to Escalon and our kitchen was not unpacked . We were in the need of a home cooked breakfast. I placed a to-go for our family. AC's customer service was a great. As for their food it was Freakin Awesome. The food was fresh and not greasy. The biscuits and gravy was spot on. And on top this the AC's food is reasonably price.< /text>

Ulta is my favorite beauty store to buy. They have many different types of brands. The store is always so organized and they have the best quality on products. My mother is also a great fan of this store. She is the one that recommended this store to me for my beauty products. I trust my mother because she has great taste in makeup and she is always testing new products for hair and skin. The last time I went I had problems with choosing a great foundation that matches with my skin. I had to ask a worker which one I should pick. The worker seemed to have knowledge with makeup and she did pick me a foundation. Getting to my house I tried it and I was perfect. The foundation perfectly matches with my skin. Definitely the store has good attention with customers.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< gmap_id>

Yes, yes, yes, !!!! I love it! Allie and Joseph helped me pick out some products and everything that they suggested for me was so on point! From the color to the product. They were very knowledgeable and informative.  I highly recommend them to be "Employee's Of The Month". Thank you again Allie and Joseph!<//text>

<review>Went in yesterday morning for nail files and walked out with a skin treatment set by Mario Badescu, and some hair products by Philosophy. The staff that helped me out was cosmetic specialist but was very polite and very helpful considering it was not her area. Provided me with great options for what I was looking for. Didn't get her name but she made it easy.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>Shopped at Ulta for some gifts.  Good selection of products for women. Surprisingly good selection of colognes for men as well. Not too bad if you need products in a pinch.  Like anything else, you can find better deals online.< /review>< Pictures>

I normally don’t come to this location but since it’s close to my job I decided to come here I was helped by the young lady named Cynthia she was so much help and so knowledgeable with her products she was able to help me with every single question I had and gave me some really good recommendations. And to top it off extremely friendly thank you so much Cynthia< /text>

If I could leave zero stars I would. I was looking for a specific product and everyone appeared busy until I found an employee and when I tried to talk to her she completely ignored me when talking to her male coworker. I found it completely disrespectful because I asked for her attention, kindly, various times. I got tired of waiting because she looked at me and kept talking with her coworker. I walked away to put back my products because I did not want to shop here anymore. When she realized she went to follow me and now tried to help. She was blonde and tall. Extremely rude and will never be returning.< /review>

<rate>1</rate><review>If I can give this place a negative star I would. They greet you yes. I can't even walk around to look at things without them looking at you the whole entire time. Walking around you like you are some sort of thief. Little do they pay attention to the ones who do actually sneak products in their puerses.I don't just like walking in stores for fun. Even before pandemic they have always been like that. I understand one thing like keeping a eye. Another thing making people feel uncomfortable.<//review>< date>

I was at this place yesterday with my husband and we took 2 colognes and 1 hand cream to the front cashier. When we got home and checked the receipt we found out they charged us for 3 colognes!! So I came back today and the security guy would not let me go thru to get to cashier and ask them to give me money back for the extra cologne they charged me for. He made me stand in line like everyone else!! This mistake of an extra charge was theirs and they want me to waste more time waiting outside in line? Next time you go to Ulta check your receipt so they dont charge you for extra items you are not taking home... but  they might be keeping for themselves!!</text>< Pictures>

I was absolutely terrified to get my haircut her after my friend had a nightmare experience. However, I took a risk and scheduled an appointment with Gabriel.  He did an incredible job and I am so happy with my new look. I am so thankful I found a stylist in the area that is an artist and passionate about what he does.  I would recommend him to everyone.<//Review>

<review>I booked appointment for 2:30 yesterday. I arrived at 2:15. I approached the counter, the person, was with a client, he did smile at me ,but never actually acknowledge me. I sat near the cash register waiting. Employees, walked by. There was an employee near me ,she just kept on working never acknowledging me. By this time it was 3pm, when that employee working near asked me if I was being helped, I told her I was waiting for Justice, then she walked away. Justice was done with his client, came up to register, I was a foot away from him and not once did he look at me or bother to acknowledge me. He kept on taking to his client.  I told him I had an appointment at 2:30 he responded I'll be right with you. Then his client decided that her hair felt heavy and asked him to thin it out. So they went back to his station. Another 15 minutes past. It was 3:45 when he finally sat me me down, he asked what I wanted done. I showed him a picture of a , a line layers Bob. He asked ok it's longer in the front I did yes. So he  cut my hair dry from the back and showed me the length I said yes that's fine. After that he washed my hair and proceed to cut my hair. He dried it a bit. I asked for a rubber band. He gave me one, I put on my hair. I paid and went home. I showered and styled my hair. The right side is longer than the left! My hair is one length, no layers . I got a chin length, buster brown, lopsided hair cut minus the bangs, for 40 bucks! I am a cosmologists did hair for many years, and the first thing I did was acknowledge the clients even if I was busy,. That's how you keep clients. Never going back!!😬😬< /review>< pics>

This is my favorite Ulta Beauty, it's really clean and had stock of things that I wanted. Overall well run!

I've been to a lot of Ulta's all over the US and this is by far the best. So many in LA are not the cleanest and always out of stock.</text>

<review>I love the option of having high end and drugstore quality makeup available in one store. If you have the money then go for it and spoil yourself and if you're more on a budget then you have the drugstore option, nevertheless there's always something for everyone at Ulta. The staff is friendly and helpful and I love the rewards points program it really comes in handy when you save your points. I am a platinum rewards member and I love the perks.

Nice clean store but it takes way more than it should for check out. I am buying one item. I don't want to wait 30 minutes. If you keep this business practice up you will have all of your customers shop online at home to avoid the wait time. Problem with that is your company loses the edge it has with availability/ convenience online. There are lower priced, lower shipping time retailers online.< /Text>

<review>Very bad customer service not one employee asked if we needed help. We headed to the salon as we wanted to dye our hair, there was two employees there each with a customer they saw us approaching but didn’t offer help either, each of them kept attending their current customer. There was no chance to ask questions both women didn’t look up at us after that first time they saw us heading their way. The cashiers weren’t friendly at all either the girl looked & sounded annoyed when my aunt asked for the price on an item, as there wasn’t one on the item itself nor the isle we found it in ( It was in the correct spot there was plenty). To top it off the security kept doing circles around the areas we were in. Very uncomfortable place to be in, we won’t be back.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1564068910634, 'text': "We're sorry to hear this, as we strive to show our guests how much we appreciate them all.

Cara was the best! Her makeup and style were hella cute too. She was super helpful. She was so patient with me and helped me find my correct foundation. She definitely knows her products and what shes doing. Thank you Cara! Ill be coming back to this Ulta as long as people are working hard like her too.<//review>

I needed to exchange a concealer and had a lot of questions. I know they had just open so I was patient because I know they were busy. Cara was the girl that helped me. She was so understanding to all the questions that I was asking. Even the silly ones. I needed someone to guide me and tell me the steps on what to do to my face. She made me understand what I was doing wrong. And that everybody's skin is different. She really helped me understand and what to do...... Ladies ......Cara is the best!!!!!😊😍😘<//Review>

It was my first time in an ULTA store. At first it was good. I had help when I was on the section where the make-up brands were more expensive. I was helped and given make-up but when I seen the "drug store" make-up I asked for help and was told I'd be helped and nothing. Then I asked a guy for help after he was done with his customer and I was no helped. So I left all the make-up except a KKW mascara.<//Review>

I wish I could give this store a no star. No one ever asks, if you need help or if you are looking for something in particular. I went on Tuesday afternoon and all the employees were talking among each other. As if it was a high school reunion. Gossip about other employees etc. On top of that this store is very  unorganized. I wanted to buy the Charles  eyeshadow pallet but since no one ask me if I needed help...I assume they didn’t have it when they did. I was very disappointed.  Stop yourself from shopping at this location!!!</Text>

Update: I've been back a few more times and the problem with the staff is still prevalent. I thought that maybe it was just the younger employees but it seems that the older staff are even more rude. I don't know, I just don't feel like shopping there if the employees are ignoring me or giggling at my accent? I rather just go to the mall.< /text>< pics>

I was here in the week before Christmas. I understand its gonna be busy and packed. But when i came in and the first thing i saw was the 1 mile line, i turned around and walked out. Shops should hire extra people during the holidays. Also have more people on the front at the register.</Review>

This salon is one of the best experiences I have ever had in my whole life! First off they are honest. They will guide you into the right path for your hair and make recommendations on what suits you. I came in because my hair was absolutely damaged. It had a lot of old color and brass. The girls here were so patient and kind. They took my frizzy, thick, damaged hair and made it into this beautiful color. They also showed me how to style it and how to avoid further damage. These girls really know what they are doing. They are professional and really care about your hair.< /Review>

<review>Stopped in with my cousin and mom because my cousin was looking for a specific perfume that she wanted but one sales girl advised that they were out of stock on the "Versace Bright Crystal Absolu", and that she could either check back or could check the Downey location.  We ALMOST LEFT THE STORE 》》》》》》
Then ZOE came up to us and offered to check the Back for stock that might not have gotten put entirely out onto the sales floor..
ZOE "Thank You"! For Going the EXTRA MILE and EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE even when the store was about to close!
DEFINITELY COMING BACK TO SEE YOU AGAIN  ~ THANK YOU AGAIN ZOE ☆😊💎<//review>< Name>

< Review>
Horrible customer service, I was the only one in line and everybody at the register was just talking away. Jasmine who was the person who rung up my items really needs to work on her customer service skills. The manager really needs to have a talk with her employees about what excellent customer service should look like!<//Review>

Definitely get your hair done here if you want to spend the extra hmph but get treated by the best.<//review>

I went on Thursday to get a formal styling for prom, I paid 60 dollars and honestly it was such a bad experience. I didn't say anything because I tried my best to be positive and enjoy my day but the girl doing my hair (Stacy) started at 12:30 and didn't
Finish until 4:45my prom started at 5:30 keep in mind I still needed to get home and finish doing my makeup and getting ready, she would constantly complain and say she  couldn't do my hair because it was too long and too thick. Maria finished off my hair and was more pleasant.. but I didn't even get prom pictures because of how late it was and by the time
I got to the venue my curls were nonexistent.<//Review>< Pictures>

Found what I was looking for 1 star because the girls there seem to have ulgy attitudes and none of them even smiled. I work in retail and you need to make guest feel welcomed and have a positive attitude toward them and smile the whole time you're there. I felt unwelcomed and some areas were messy not good presentation of the store with the items and employees please fix that.It also seemed like they didn't want to help anyone so they just pretend to look busy and I know what that looks like and they don't even walk up to you.Guest experience should always be number one in every retail store.< /Text>

I love it here. I'm always trying on the example ones. And you can easily take it off because there's so many other lotions and make up removers. It's really big too. There's also the make up salon where they can darken your eyebrows or other things.</Review>

<Text>Unlike other Ulta stores that I have visited, this is the only one where the workers don’t bother asking if you need anything. They act and sound as though they are angry and are not aware of the signs they put on their makeup such as the “buy one get one free” only to find out after waiting in line for forever that the special expired only because they did not notice they had to remove the sign. Very annoying to come to this Ulta. Employees need to practice their customer service skills.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Take in mind that I had my 18 month old with me wanting to also try on makeup as she too is a makeup aficionado. Nevertheless, I came out happy with a bag full of new big girl toys (makeup). Also, NYX was having this event to promote their foundation. I had never bought any NYX stuff, that just changed. Keep up the good work, Ulta Team!

Has good variety of makeup. Many different brands, prices vary.  I needed some assistance on makeup but no one was available to help. I ask the security and he had no idea where anybody was either. Only one cashier was handling a long line, poor thing, and i did not want to bug her, she had her hands full. Maybe i will go another day, but i really doubt it.< /review>

<Review>If I can rate this store a 0 I would. The staff is so not customer friendly and one cashier really??? while the rest are just there standing around seeing customers pile up in line. As a professional I am disappointed I only love going to Ulta in The San Fernando Valley Like Burbank or Fallbrook where real makeup artist are hired not some regular teenagers that think they better than the customers!!!! First time and last shopping in this area!!!</Review>< Pictures>

Sometimes items are on sale and you will never find out until you get to the register. For example most of the Ardell products where on sale for 50%off. Was it advertise in its section? No! I found out until i was paying. If i would of known i would of bought more. This has happen at least 4 times already with other items.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c2cc19697ba4cf:0x8d8cf9c32a11dad4<//Gmap_id>< Pics>

Products are great, but the service isn’t. The employees don’t smile, don’t help, & don’t care. What a joke.<//Text>

If I could give a zero, I would. while on vacation, On 12/30/17 the m.o.d (manager of the day)who looked more like a janitor with all those keys dangling started following my besties husband for no reason. He came to us and was telling us about how she rudely approached him when she literally started yelling loudly if we needed any help. I was ready to purchase $300 in products We were there to spend money. Ulta really needs to retrain this m.o.d cuz she stereotyped a loyal customer and the ghetto came out of her.

Horrible customer service! Went in there totally willing to spent money. I was just a bit undivided of which brand I wanted and NO ONE could help me. Staff seemed lazy and annoyed I will never come back! The Ulta in Redondo Beach is way nicer and the staff is amazing it's further but worth the drive!!!!< /Review>

My shopping experience was bad because most of the makeup was disorganized and very filthy. I was checking out the tarte tape counselors and the test samples seemed so dirty and had many layers of makeup dripping. Dont try those on your face. They need to make an effort to keep the store organizer stock and clean up the test samples.< /Text>

Management in this location is horrible! Most sales associates are nice and welcoming...I always come in and take home more than 200$ in product. Most of the time I leave happy and call it a day. But I will no longer come to this location ever again.

Kara, a so called manager is the rudest person I have ever come a crossed. I can’t believe her lack of respect. Coming from retail management position myself I’m in awe how she is even a manager. Not professional, can not keep her composure under pressure. Confrontational and very aggressive.

Two times already she has rudely treated me infront of other customers and her fellow employees. First time she tried to embarrass me and the second time she told me I wasn’t allowed to step Into her store...big mistake! I have now called corporate on the same rude employee. Kara, hasn’t grown as a employee still continues to be rude, unprofessional, unqualified for her position in this company. She is not a good example to her team and the rest of management does not fall too back behind her.

If anybody reads this please, don’t come here drive a little further down to Downey. In the new plaza on Lakewood Blvd. You will have a better experience. The store is much cleaner, better staff, more product, and most importantly profesional management that keeps their staff and store looking great. Plus you will not have to ever deal with someone like their unqualified manager Kara. I don’t wish that on nobody. This also goes to the General manager who never reached out to me after all of this. I’m waiting for the districts manager to call me and I’m sure they will then take care of the matter.< /text>

I don have complain with the atore or products,  it's more  about the salon services , omg!! So bad experience it was my first time and the last ,  i think i can do my hair by my self better than pay $ 200, and get horrible results ,  i got orange hair color , on  the highlights , i speend alot money and time , 6 to 9 pm. For nothing i thought if i pay more money its cuz it worth, but it was a disaster,  my hair look like diferent color orange , blond and its not soft , like usually be when i do my hair in a salon,  so never again ,  so disappointed<//text>

Sad to say but every time that I need something from here (this ULTA) they never have what I need. Most of the people working here don't care about customers. Or maybe I am the only one who gets ignored by them.< /Review>

<Review>This ULTA has the worst customer service ever I seen in any store what a disappointment, I came in early Saturday morning was looking for a mascara and the girls there seem to be mad or something like they didn't want to be there,  I was afraid to ask any questions, As I was heading to the salon hoping to get a haircut and as soon as the women in the front desk of the salon saw me coming towards them approaching they both look at each other rolling there eyes that's so unprofessional they both wispered something to each other so I instead pretended  to look around looking at the (sale items )they had near the salon hoping one of them would walk away so I could come in for services instead I heard them GOSSIPING to each other about there private life (go clean your stations or dissenfect combs or clean shampoo bowls  ) I'm not one to be nosey but you couldn't help it over hear them chit chatting since they were just standing around doing nothing but talking , when I turn hoping they would stop talking they looked at me again like saying what do you want wow just horrible!!! I left I wouldn't want  negative people cutting my hair< /Review><Date>1490526595212<//Date><gmapID>0x80c2cc19697ba4cf:0x8d8cf9c32a11dad4</gmapID><user_id>115454108654377419042</user_id><pics>None< /pics>< Rate>

I visited the store today and I really liked the customer service. Even the security guard tried to help me as well hah I went in for a color match. Right away I was referred to another associate who asked me my preferrence and right away tried foundation on me. It was exactly what I asked for! She even gave me tips! I got all my questions answered and felt like she was about to do my make up as well lol I was very pleased couldn't get her name. I would definitely recommend!! Idk why the bad comments, maybe the "blonde girl" they talk about isnt there anymore lol<//Text>

Out of all the ultas I have been to this is the worst one. Service was horrible especially from the blonde with the buzz cut. Rude and extremely unhelpful. I hate writing reviews but the service here was so unacceptable I had to write one.<//review>

YOU GUYS NEED NEW EMPLOYEES!!
What did I like about it? Nothing. Besides the products.
Customer service? Disgusting. You walk in there & they don't welcome you, they mad dog you when you're checking out the make up. I'm always buying make up there, so why they acting brand new for ? And when you ask a question or something they be acting like they working for free all mad n s***. Honey you getting paid to assist me, now fix your salty ass attitude & do as I ask.<//text>

< review>
This store is the worst store that I been to.
The staff there won't help you .! And if you ask a question they will respond back to NO . When items are in sale they don't put the add ons. And they are always out of stock Always . !
I won't return back to store anymore. Really disappointed.<//review>

< Review>
👎🏾I hate this ULTA store Custumer service is horrible when in to buy what I needed and couldn't find it . I ask for help and the cashiers we're rude and talking to each other a blond one and a chubby one with black hair by far the worst place to shop for your beauty needs<//Review>

<gmapID>0x80c2cc19697ba4cf:0x8d8cf9c32a11dad4</gmapID><Review>(Translated by Google) The truth is it is a very beautiful place, unfortunately I have to rate it badly because the cashiers who attend there do not help anything, it is located in a place where most of the people are Latin and people ask and they pretend they do not understand anything, let's not They have nothing like a rod of gabachas because of the face of Latinas or mestiza ... I went to pay and the two Ms who were in conrtigua asked prices and none of the three cashiers helped, they were neglected and the one who dispatched did not speak mada Spanish, very bad attention. From the box area and it is the most important side because they have to give prices, explain colors in short, bad situation.

(Original)
La verdad es un lugar muy bonito lastimosamente los tengo que calificar mal porqué las cajeras que atienden ahi no ayudan a nada, esta ubicado en un lugar donde ña mayoria de personas son latinas y la gente pregunta y ae hacen como que no entienden nada vamos no tienen nada de vara de gabachas puera caraa de latinas o mestiza... Pase a pagar y las dos Sra que estaban en vaja conrtigua perguntaeon precios y ninguna de las tres cajeras ayudaron se gic9eron ñas desatendidas y la que despacha no hablo mada español, muy mala atencion. Del area de cajas y es el lado mas importante pues tienen quw dar precios, explicar colores en fin mala situacin.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<rate>3</rate><text>(Translated by Google) I give it 3 stars no more because the lady who helped me in the store was very kind, she helped me with what I was looking for, she was interested in helping me how bad it was when the cashier paid, she asked me if I had a number associated with them and I said no and then she told the other client, give me your phone number for the points, I think out of respect and because it was my money, the cashier had to first tell me it's okay if I give the points to her or tell me do you want to register with us since she was a new customer.

Le doy 3 estrella no mas por que la senorita  que me ayudo en la tienda fue muy amable me ayudo con lo que andava buscando se le veia interes en ayudarme lo malo fue cuando pague la cajera me pregunto si tenia numero a sociado con ellos y le dije que no y entonces le dijo a la otra clienta dame tu numero de telefono para los puntos, creo que por respeto y por que era mi dinero la cajera  tenia primero que decirme esta bien si le doy los puntos a ella o decirme quieres regristarte con nosotros  ya que era nueva clienta.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>(Translated by Google) One of the girls who is attending today who also speaks Spanish, with black hair and a little chubby, takes super bad care. Apparently she does not like a job where she must be willing to the public to advise on brand or quality. The person who attended me spoke only English and I asked him if he could help me and he did so very reluctantly. When she finished with me another person came asking her where for a perfume and she just played deaf and went to another part of the place. Where is the quality of service on these sites?

(Original)
Una de las chicas q está atendiendo hoy que habla también español, de cabello negro y algo gordita atiende súper mal. Aparentemente no le gusta un trabajo donde debe estar dispuesta al público para aconsejar en marca o en calidad.  La persona q me atendió hablaba sólo inglés y le pregunto q si me podía ayudar y lo hizo de muy mala gana.  Al terminar conmigo llego  otra persona preguntándole donde por un perfume y ella solo se hizo la sorda y siguió para otra parte del lugar. Donde está la calidad en la atención de estos sitios?<//review>< Pictures>
