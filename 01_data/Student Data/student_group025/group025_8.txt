I like Fed Ex very much but the Bell branch screwed up an expensive delivery from Overstock. The delivery man put my purchases at the building NEXT DOOR. My  things were also left in a wet area. I would encourage Fed Ex to be more careful when reading the address and matching the numbers on the building to the GPS.<//Text>

<Text>Like many other people posting here, I had the unfortunate bad luck of this company being in charge of me receiving my package. They are liars saying they tried to deliver the package but no one was at the location to sign for it. Why was there no delivery notice left on the door? The USPS has a bad reputation but they are WAY better than this outfit. The worst service I think I've received in my life. Do not use this location, and better yet, stay away from Fedex.</Text>< pictures>

This is by far the worst delivery service available when it comes to actually delivering a package. If i didn’t drive 25 mins to pick up my package i wouldn’t have ever got it. Even with clear directions they can’t do the simplest of tasks. I wish i could rate this experience a 0 out of 5 if i pay for shipping and delivery i would expect at least a slight effort in trying to actually deliver it.<//text>

Waiting for a package can be challenging enough. Not knowing exactly what time it will arrive but being provided with a day allows you to plan accordingly. However with this location that is NOT the case.  I have been waiting a whole week to receive a package that I ordered 2 weeks ago. I am now waiting 4 days past my delivery date. Not one  tag was left. I have not seen a fed ex truck on my block. I don’t even think the driver arrived! Calling customer service was a nightmare. The representative have the audacity to tell me I should have chosen another shipping option! And to top things off they are making it seems as if I cannot pick my items up in person when I KNOW THAT IS AN OPTION! If I could give 0 stars I would. Bell needs to get it together.<//text>

<text>This place is horrible. I have had two absolutely terrible experiences with FedEx from this location. Both times have involved my package not being delivered to me and no door tags being left to explain. When I called (multiple times between the two instances) for assistance I am told there is nothing they can do. This afternoon when I asked what my next steps were to get my package in my care I was told "I can't tell you what to do, but I will ask the driver leave a door tag next time."

Last time, I had to actually go to the location to pick up. It was a nightmare. It took forever, the staff was not friendly, they made me drive my car into the loading dock, get out of my car in the loading dock, and load my package into the trunk. They wouldn't even lift it. Mind you, this is an active facility with semi-trucks, forklifts, and me in my dress and heels standing in a loading dock, mere feet away from semi-trucks and forklifts. Needless to say, I did not feel safe in that situation.

This time I caught it on my online tracking that two attempts have been made and a final attempt would be made tomorrow--because again no door tags left at my house. I finally got someone almost competent on the phone this evening and they are delivering it to a store a mile out of my way, he seemed to want a thank you for rerouting it to that location.

I would avoid FedEx and this location at all costs.< /text><user>104858465488424324412<//user><name>Chelsey Smith< /name><response>None<//response><pictures>None< /pictures>< Gmap_id>

The worst delivery company I ever dealt with, they don't know if my box was delivered to wrong address or still in the delivery truck, they had all day yesterday to figure it out but they couldn't as they failed to communicate with the driver.
Their solution? According to Fedex: Although the driver scanned the box as delivered, it could still be in the truck(it happens sometime, I doubt it as someone I don't know signed for it), so FedEx's instruction is that I need to stay home for next 4 days in case the box might be delivered and if not I need to contact the sender.
So my time is irrelevant to FedEx, miss work and stay home for 2 days(1st 2 days of the 4 are weekend)for a box which may or may not come.

7 minutes(1:15pm) after I got an email saying that it was delivered, I spoke to FedEx to let them know that it wasn't delivered and told them to contact the driver to retrieve the box while he's still around the area since it was signed by someone, they had all afternoon to get the box back but they didn't.

As for their stupid policy of needing a signature for delivery, if you let anyone sign for it and take it then why bother getting a signature?

Stupid policies and the WORST customer service.

I highly recommend to avoid using this company.<//Review>

Fedex literally lied saying they “tried to deliver and no one was home.” I called customer support and they confirmed that the package didn’t even move from facility and now I have to wait an extra 3 days for my package. After this, never using Fedex again.</text>

Who ever the driver is delivering from this location to west LA  needs to be fired. I don’t even think he parks his truck to bring items to the front door of my building on a busy street. I picture him just driving by and throwing it out his window as he passes. Two packages lost within a month of each other and one I paid extra shipping to get it before this weekends birthday for my husband. No other delivery service has an issue bringing my orders into my building and to my apartment door. This guy is pretty much leaving my packages in the street,  not even enough curtesy to bring it in the lobby. Fire him/ them if it’s more than one person. They are a liability to customers and your business.< /Text>

I am very disappointed with this facility. They failed to deliver by christmas and to make it worse, they lost my package. I went to talk to Ryan the manager and he had no answers for me. I will push for accountability for who's  responsible.
With all the scanning technology. There's no excuse. They said they made an attempt, I told them that they must have an invisible driver because my camera caught a nothing. Fake attempts should be a crime.

Corporate needs to follow up with all these complaints against this facility.

Called to get an ETA and the young girl there was super helpful! She went above and beyond to give me a pretty accurate eta.  FedEx driver was very nice and right on schedule.  I was a little nervous not getting my package on time after reading other reviews, but I am completely satisfied with the staff and driver from the Bell home delivery office.<//Text>

fake attempt notice. I missed their first 2 attempts and waiting home all day on the scheduled delivery day. However there was fedex car outside my apartment and I thought they would bring my package, nobody showed up but on my tracking it says third attempt failed because I wasn't home. I think delivery driver is messed up. Anyway UPS is much better than FEDEX.< /text>

<Time>1564190738725<//Time><rate>5< /rate><text>My package was delayed by one day and I still did not received my package. So I called customer service and was told the location was already closed. I was disappointed and thought about writing feedback here when Jose Yanez the FedEx delivery person rang my door bell. It was a surprise and I was really glad that I could receive my package. After a brief talk, I knew he was working overtime trying to get all the packages delivered. For all the other negative reviews, I could totally understand the frustration but I just want to share my own experience here. LA traffic is no joke so it is possible that not all packages would get delivered on time. But maybe customer expectation management could be improved. Communicating real time status might also help.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Wow - I remember a day when FedEx stood for quality and leadership in package delivery. Now, dealing with them is a nightmare. I will literally no longer purchase a product that delivers with FedEx. They are unreliable, untruthful, and completely unhelpful. I’d give them 0 stars if I could. Blechh!!!</Text>

Worst fedex drivers ever they don't even bother to make an attempt to deliver the package . Lazy workers . Seen them leaving without  deliver my package multiple times through my window.  I even try to chase them down with no luck. Hate the fact that some of my orders go through this fedex location.  If I could avoid them I would .!</text>

<Review>My husband stayed home from work to help the delivery man handle our shipment. He claimed to have attempted a delivery, which was not true. While I was on the phone with Fed-X to file a complaint, the driver doubled-back to place a note on my door. Not one time did he ring our doorbell, which is quite loud. When I phoned customer service, I was lied to a total of seven times within a two-hour period. One person said the driver was returning to my home at night to deliver my shipment, which was a lie. Another person said he was on the phone with a dispatcher, which was a lie. Another person said a manager will phone me in 15 minutes, which was a lie. Someone else said the dispatcher will phone me in 20 minutes, which was a lie. Another person said the driver really did attempt the delivery, although my surveillance video reveals otherwise. Someone else claimed that I had the wrong delivery date, which is disputed by the text messages I've received from Fed-X. This company is a joke.<//Review>< gmap_id>

The ONLY reason I reluctantly gave 1 star was in order for me to post my comment. This FedEx location is a poor, pathetic reflection of the other locations that do satisfactory or above satisfactory  work. Their lack of communication and professionalism at this city of Bell location NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION and serious MANAGEMENT HELP! Specifically because my husband had a 10 AM interview (arrived at 9:40), communcated with Sergio (the manager in charge LOL) and NEVER received a response. My husband checked in with security & waited for Sergio until 11 o’clock. Needless to say......3 hrs. and counting we have heard NOTHING from that manager.  I will now ONLY DO BUSINESS WITH UPS!< /text>

<review>This location I dislike with a passion. They're driver indicated that they made 3 attempts to deliver when they only made 2. Then they update their system stating that they will try again and instead hold at their facility. I had someone waiting for all day to take delivery but just because they don't have my same last name they would't even though I wrote a note stating to leave it with a copy of my own ID. THIS IS A JOKE. I work in an industry where packages are delivered everyday and have never had such a pain with a delivery. I will make sure not to use FED EX ever again.

<Text>Try calling to find out store hours. Try it. It’s insane.

After an infuriating automated phone system, I get to speak to a rep, who cannot find this major fedex location even though 1) I pick up from there all the time, 2) the address was provided to me on the door tag 3) the address was verbally given to me on the phone by a FedEx rep days prior.
And this agent on the phone is telling me “sir there is no FedEx location at that zip code”, and puts me on hold, and asks for my personal address- only after 20 minutes to say “ah yes, I see it now. There is a location there. The hours are 8am to 4pm.”
20 minutes for a business hours request....
I should note that this is the day after thanksgiving, I figured it’d be good to call to see if they’re open since it’s a special weekend.<//Text>< Pics>

So my package was supposed to be delivered this Thursday February 22, 2018. The thing is it said it was delivered but I'm a stay at home mom so at the time I check there was no package.  I checked with my neighbors and nothing. I called immediately so the driver could fix his mistake and they couldn't even get a hold of him. I called yesterday and still nothing no information. I called again today and it turns outs the drivers misdeliverd not only my package but 4 more packages. Fedex might be good to business deliveries but to residential local home deliveries they are the worse. THE WORSE. My package misdeliverd with other 4 people packages. I would give 0 stars if it allowed me.< /Text>

They say they will call you back.  They LIE.   They don't call you back.  They say they leave a note.  They don't.  They LIE.   And with a box that does not require a signature, they say you have to be there.

Avoid like the plague.<//text>

Sitting in my office waiting for my package to arrive and received a notification at that the driver attempted to deliver my package when they just blew by my office apparently because it's not a residence.  Fedex has become the counter productive company for one that's supposed to be supporting businesses, maybe this is why Amazon works with UPS.  I have had trouble receiving my Fedex packages almost every time I've  been stuck using Fedex.   I'm going to cancel my order and re-order and encourage the seller to discontinue using Fedex.  I schedule my packages to arrive for a reason, I do not work for Fedex, I should not be scheduled whenever is convenient for you.<//text>

<Review>FedEx is horrible the worst customer service I've ever experienced in my life!!!! I really don't understand  how this company is still in business. I've NEVER had this issue with UPS. If I knew the place I ordered from uses FedEx I would have never made the purchase. Smh</Review>< Name>

<Text>I don't here for all my pharmacy needs. There pharmacy is super helpful and are great with answering questions. There stuff in pharmacy as well are very helpful. Covid-19 procedure are taken very seriously here. At times they will shut down to clean the entire store so if you're coming out from a far place call ahead.<//Text><Rate>5</Rate>< user_id>

<Review>Yesterday I went to pick up a prescription for my mom and the pharmacist Jonathan provided the worse Customer Service I have ever experienced.

When I pulled up to the window Jonathan didn’t even acknowledge me or say just a moment while he wiped  down the drawer, his area and equipment. He then walked away and after several minutes he comes back and says how can I help you. When I told him what I wanted and provided all of my mother’s information he walks away again. Several minutes later a female comes to the window and asks how can she could help me. When I told her she saw all of the information already on the computer. She comes back with my mom’s prescription right away. By this time my blood is boiling and I questioned her did Jonathan just go on break without telling me and she confirms that he did. I tell her how rude and  unprofessional he was by not telling me he was going on break and that someone will be right with me. She apologizes and says he’s new. Although I appreciated her apology there is no excuse for rudeness and being new should not give anyone a pass. If anything being new you should be following the manual for providing good customer service  by the book. Now I’m questioning is this the type of behavior they are teaching.</Review>< Time>

I waited for about 15 mins in line to get to the cashier, there were 4 workers 3 of then cashier but only one was on the register, the second lady "cashier" was taking pics of of customers waiting in line instead of helping on the other cashier register, when I finally made it to pay the cashier lady was having a bad day with a bad attitude to customers.</text>

<Text>Every time i come to this store the staff is always so wonderful to me, so kind and helpful with any questions or things i need. They totally look out for their community. The manager Yolanda is always so nice and pleasant to deal with, she always so nice to my kids as well and trust me they are hard to handle especially in a store. Best rite-aid i have every visited by far!! The management and staff are up to par :) will always go here for my daily needs.</Text>< gmapID>

<review>I regret it to choose here as my pharmacy! They really do t care I was too sick nearly could stand in line and when get there she asked me to wait for 1 hour just to put 6 ready antibiotics on a pocket even when I explained I can’t wait I need to start taking them she didn’t try to help. I walked out without my antibiotics until my husband got them at night for me!

<rate>1< /rate><Text>Don’t count on this rite aide to call you to notify you when your prescription is ready. They take no responsibility or action to help the customer to let them know your stuff was refilled. They just continually say their system is down and there’s nothing they can do about it. So if your life depends on having a prescription filled at an accurate time do not count on them to let you know.

There system is always down.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Stopped by on 9/13 around 9:30 to get one thing. The two woman in the front were incredibly rude. Not only did they give me attitude the cashier a middle aged hispanic lady rolled her eyes at me when she gave me the receipt. After both of them where laughing at something over the radio that someone was saying to them. Please train your team in customer service or hire some qualified management.< /Text>< Pictures>

Can you PLEASE post the correct hours for drive thru? The hours are not posted on the window of the drive thru and so I called and asked specifically what time the drive thru closes.  I was told 10pm over the phone, show up at 8 and they're closed.  I couldn't come into the store because I had my dog with me.
Other than that,  I've had a good experience with this store.
Thankyou.</Review>< Pics>

Good experience, well stocked with Dayquil and cough drops and Listerine. It was  open early at 7 a.m. on Saturday.  Had a nice chat with the man at the counter. The man suggested I get a bag, which I'm glad he reminded me. He asked me if I had a rite-aid card and I used my phone number and got a 4 dollar discount.< /text>

Horrible.  Workers do not know what the other is doing.  One says one thing and vice versa.  My local rite told me there would NOT be a problem transferring.  The other said they couldn't.  I've transferred rite aids before with no issue. Now I have to go out of my way for me to get my MAJOR SEIZURE meds    They also told me I would actually have to call my Dr to switch to their rite aid.    Foothill rite aid is straight BS . DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!</text>

Near halfway house, so always weirdos hanging out out front. Apparently, the pharmacy phones don't work because they do call you when your prescriptionnia ready nor pick up their phone when you call. No pharmacist on duty when I dropped off my script, just 5 girls not answering the phones talking about some drama.<//review>

I went on Saturday  to pick up my child's prescription.  I had gone online for the pharmacy hours which said they were open Saturday  from 7am to 10 pm. I got there at 7 pm and the drive thru was closed with a hand written note saying the drive thru hours were different.  So, I got down and went in. It was closed inside too. I'm glad that my son still has enough pills to hold him over for a couple days. I was disappointed  that their hours posted online do not reflect their true hours.< /text>

Horrible service in the pharmacy. Dropping off my prescription didn't take any time at all. I came back and waited for 45 min in line to find out that they had my prescription ready, but if I wanted to use my insurance they were going to have me wait an additional 20 min to  recount the pills. And not to mention I provided my insurance when I dropped the prescriptions off. Not that CVS is any better. Are there any good pharmacies in Sylmar I think not.<//Review>

Pharmacy is the WORST!!! They say ur dr denied ur refill then I called the dr office and they say that they never got a request for refill. So many times this has happened . The final straw was the pharmacist had me on hold and I was in the drive thu and was watching him and he was just ignoring my call.  He didn't know I was waiting in line watching him. The worst pharmacy ever! !</review>

<text>Great location, pharmacy is okay and register lines are iffy. So many people complaining about this rite aid, what are the alternatives? I never rate a place based on the best places in the world, I base it off the area and the competition. CVS in san fernando is beyond horrible and the other big name pharmacies are worse. I've experienced the problems these people complain about, and yet I still give 4*. I was born and raised by empire state building in NYC. Theres a CVS 1 block from there on fifth avenue, very high traffic averaging 40 people in a 1500 sq ft store...and they have usually 1 to 2 cashiers with lines in excess of 15 all day, the pharmacy is usually gated closed and you have to ring a bell to get someone to open it. Point being, lower your standards, its Rite Aid, not a private independent pharmacy.

Parking lot is great, for those complaining about pharmacy hours, go to their direct location website and check PHARMACY HOURS which is different than store hours.</text>< Pics>

The pharmacy is absolutely horrible.  They are not helpful at all.  I called and they left me on hold for 26 minutes without coming back once in that time.  I hung up and called back and they picked up, no greeting, and put me on hold again.  Every pharmacy technician I've spoken to in the last 2 years has been rude and unhelpful.  I would not recommend filling prescriptions at this location.</text>

Absolutley the worst service I have ever had from a pharmacy.  They never seem to have the perscription ready or they don't know anything about it.
If you call to check on the status they don't know about it.
Don't even think about waiting for it at the store, you will be ignored.</Review>

Poor customer service when I went to the store and even worse over the phone.  Wait times ..well they just forgot I was on the phone.  When I called back they hung up and the 3rd time , the receiver was picked up but no one spoke.</Text>

(Translated by Google) It is a good place where you can find a little of everything, but they exaggerate in some prices. They also made me come to the pharmacy twice because my son's medicine was not ready, the second time it was ready but they made me wait 15 more minutes without any reason when the medicine was already there

(Original)
Es un buen lugar donde puedes encontrar un poco de todo, pero exageran en algunos precios. Además me hicieron venir 2 veces a la farmacia porque el medicamento de mi hijo no estaba listo, la segunda vez ya estaba listo pero me hicieron esperar 15 minutos más sin algún motivo alguno cuando ya estaba ahí el medicamento< /text>

Lure you in with a low price on gas then you see you have to pay inside. I'm sure there is a fee for using your card & the gas ain't so cheap after that fee. Guy outside tells me you gotta pay inside, ya ok no. This place used to be a 76 now its a "0". I miss the good old days.< /Text><username>Swartz Robles<//username></record></dataset><record>

Dropped by this store to get a bus pass but wasn't able to purchase one because they don't take credit cards for  bus pass purchases. Store not in a very good neighboorhod. If you're a woman I wouldn't visit this store by yourself.< /Text>

Good selection of items. Helps save a trip to larger more packed grocery store. I especially recommend the carne and chicken asada. This place has it all</text>

I believe the girl that assisted me was Jessica (she has magenta highlights). She’s awesome! I went during the Black Friday weekend and thought my visit would take longer. Instead, she kindly greeted me, asked if I was looking for anything specific and the item was ready for check out before I even made it inside. Great customer service.< /Text>

It can bring out the creative side of you. It is a little higher than convenient stores but what they have you also won't find in those other stores. The employees are very helpful and friendly.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<rating>1< /rating><review>Poor customer service. Just when I step on the store no warm welcome but a reminder right away that tester are just for display. Staff literally moved to another customer and ignored me while she knows I still need her help. I guess I have to be wearing LV purse too like the lady she chosed to help just to be treated fairly. They’re in a rush because they’re about to close, which I understand. But the staff who left me hanging didn’t even bother to apologize but instead told me they’re closing in 2mins. Had to just get whatever shade I think matches my skintone just to get the make up that I really need.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

It was very nice and professional! I was just starting to wear makeup and the foundation I got made me look orange. Fortunately, the workers helped me find the right foundation and color even with the social distancing rules!< /Review>

Helpful staff, store is clean, products are usually available.  Never have an issue finding your shade.

Greeter is always at the door, testers are never empty, overall a great experience.< /Review>

<Text>Not my favorite Sephora.  They are oftentimes sold out of products and the store is not the cleanest.  Nothing worse than going in and asking for a specific clear eyebrow gel and they respond by saying they are sold out of clear brow gel in EVERY brand they sell.  Come on now, get it together with the inventory.<//Text>< date>

I agree with the other bad reviews. I kindly asked one employee if the Sephora brand mascara was water proof and she said only the ones on line. Then I asked if there were other brands that were water proof and she simply said yes, but did not bother to help or recommend or suggest anything, she simply went back and continue to walk back and forth the perfume isle and do nothing. The store was pretty quiet so no excuse. Then suddenly the line at register got long and only one person at register. When someone finally came to help, she stood at counter for a while then finally said are you ready. Not very friendly sales employees.<//review>

This has been the worst Sephora I've ever been to. I talked to management and they did not care about my experience in their store. Called customer service and they didn't care what I had to say either. Sephora is definitely not my fav make-up store anymore... Learn how to take care of your loyal customers Sephora! Thanks!< /review>

To write a review I had to give a star. If it were in me I would not give it any stars. The service is bad, there is a person in charge (I think he is the manager) and he is always looking at you and following you as if you were stealing something.
He walks around the store with a boar. Writing notes, according to him. He does not do anything productive, only makes customers uncomfortable. And that's not good. I say it because since he is a manager and visited the store several times and always has the same attitude.</review>

This is Larry Millete’s wife, May.  I just came from the store and they are NOT helpful at all.  I’m not very familiar with makeup and would’ve really appreciated their expertise but the one girl I asked, she laughed when I didn’t know the name of the “eyeliner gel pod”.  Then simply said “Oh we’re out of Anastasia but there Bobbi Brown.”  And pointed be to a wall...  this is why I hate going to that store... they’re judgemental.  They probably looked at me, no make up and clueless and instead of helping a customer, they just ignore and go about walking around.  Got my stuff and left.  I don’t think I’ll ever go back there again.</Review>

Went to return or exchange one of their Sephora Mist airbrush foundation products that stopped working half way on me and they couldn't bring my name up, email or phone number on their screen, even if I always shop there, they told me to find the receipt and i obviously dont have it because I wasnt thinking of returning the product, it just stopped working. Not to mention, they didn't give me my birthday gift either.</Text>

The person over the phone said... yes we have them, yes we have all the colors, yes we can help you to find a right shade for you. I mean that's what you expect from a store like this... this kind of service no less. BUT NOOOOOO. I GOT THERE AND THIS "OLDER WOMAN" THAT GOT TO BRING OUT THE BLUSHES TO SEE.......... OMG SHE WAS SO RUDE TELLING ME WHATEVER SHE WANTED INTERRUPTING ME NOT LETTING ME EXPLAIN TO HER THAT I HAD CALLED AND I EVEN SHOWED HER THE PHONE NUMBER..... I DID CALL THAT STORE......I SHOULD HAVE ASKED TO TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE... BUT I WAS TOO BUSY THINKING... POOR WOMAN SHE GOT F... IN THE A... WRONG.... I gave this store a 5 star review because of the young woman that saw me and walked towards me and asked me if I needed help. She did help me look for some tweezers, she helped me spend my rewards points... she saved this review.... for the store. Seriously people... if you are too old to work there... maybe you feel too tired of hearing people's needs, thoughts, and don't want them to spend their money with you.... go flip burgers...</text>< Pics>

Ok so there Is usually plenty of parking which is great specially during lunch hours. The drive thru is easy to locate. The staff is friendly polite and deliver great service. The food is well cooked AND ! They didn't forget to include napkins! I love it. I ordered the shrimp tackle box with fries. The food was not at all greasy 5 extra ⭐ there I think they use air fryers 🤔 maybe not but, non the less great quality food ,service and location is clean.< /review>

<user>114429065474190117602< /user><review>"Crispy,fresh and delicious"... thats what I was thinking after trying the chicken made at The Popeyes Famous Louisiana Chicken at their
store in Colton,California on West Valley Blvd.
They have a complete Popeyes menu with their famous sodas and drinks ,a drive through and very friendly and courteous staff.A great experience!
They also have free parking and just off the I-10 freeway.

I usually love Popeyes but today this was the worse I ever had. The surf and turf was old very hard shrimp which was hidden under the chicken tenders. I recommend that you check your food before you drive away from the drive thru. Food went straight to the trash. Inedible!</text>

<review>After waiting in line forever,  they got my order all wrong and asking 2x what drink they still gave me the wrong one. Ugh sandwich was all soggy and mashed potatoes were only half full. I HATE they discontinued the Jambalaya.... That was my favorite thing on the menu!!! So disappointing 🤬< /review>< pictures>

Ordered regular chicken sandwiches, but were given the spicy version in error (discovered when we got home); but otherwise this location is always fast and friendly.<//Review>

I noticed the cashier left after my order and started packing food, left a customer behind me just standing there, didn't acknowledge him or nothing. Thats poor customer service. If you're that busy at least acknowledge the customers</Review>

Worst customer service ever! I asked for the number to corporate and  the manager to me to goggle it, then when I asked who was the branch manager she told me none of my business! This is the way you treat first responders. Just left there never going back thanks to Host# 60105 she would not give me her name.<//Review>

Had to wait around 11 minutes for a drive thru order. But they were nice enough for this to not matter. Besides it was a big order. 11:40am time of order, couple cars in the drive thru on a Tuesday. Hot food, and given correctly. Props to the employees. Thank you<//text>

<text>Ordered a family meal with popcorn shrimp at the drive thru and they messed up my order. When I went in the manager told me that I didn't ask for it correctly but it was plainly printed on my receipt what was supposed to be in my order so how did I not ask for it correctly. Over heard the manager telling her staff that they messed up another order. Also to top it all off we spent over 40 dollars and the food was poor quality. It was not cooked properly, it was cold, and it didn't taste right. We usually like Popeyes but this location and staff made us extremely upset. We are never going back to this location again.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Did not get what I ordered. Went in to talk to someone and all 10 people made 2 of wait at the counter for 10 minutes while they tended to the drive thru. Only about 3 cars there.<//Review>

Was only taking Cash, I get it technical difficulties...but then they didn't have change and asked if that was ok? 🤔Then the cherry on top, I get home and I'm missing part of my order🤨. Not a great first experience at this new location. Oh BTW what was the hype all about on "The Sandwich"?< /Review>

< Review>
Popeyes food is always great. But there service lacked true customer culture. Their employees forgot part of meal, I drove all the way home. When I tried to contact them no answer over the phone. I called for 10 minutes straight.. Then the manager treated me like dirt, their employees forgot my food. I drove all the way home and asked for a little compensation for their error. Again she pretty much told me to get over it and it wasn't her problem. I'll make sure I never return to this Popeyes specifically because of their service. Rude people.<//Review>

Indoor dinning is back at 25 % capacity! Where do I start, today I enjoyed the best mini sopes ever.. it is obvious that the food served is handled with care using fresh quality ingredients with presentation being considered as well. These little guys were full of flavor! I will plan to come back a couple of times a week if possible. Now to the restaurant itself, very classy, elegant Mexican look and beyond clean! Very spacious which allows for social distancing. I haven't checked out the bar but I'm sure the drinks are just as good as the food. Staff is very welcoming and attentive.

I highly recommend for their cleanliness and high quality Mexican food.</review>

We were so excited to hear that the new and improved Mama Lupe's was now open after their remodel. Our party of 4 stopped by on a Saturday afternoon ready to have some good food and that we did! Started with two beers and some Street Corn with chips & salsa. The Street Corn was packed with fresh corn roasted just right, full of flavor, and of course lots of cotija cheese. The chips were lightly salted with plenty of crunch... totally made in house. And the salsa- yes please!! After all that we were stoked to get our meals which included an enchilada plate, quesadilla, and a grilled chicken burrito smothered in the house green sauce. EVERYTHING was delish but my favorite by far was the green sauce on the burrito. So light and flavorful with just a little bit of a spicy punch.
The remodel looks great!! You have to check out the bar top... such a personal touch that shouldn't be missed on your visit.
The ADA bathrooms are clean, crisp, and have great tile. They even have the cutest little sinks!

Can't wait to visit again soon... We will be back!!< /text>

Love the people. Love the food. I grew up with Mama Lupe's classic and recently went back for their after renovation/remodeling...still wonderful people. Still godly food. And I love what they have done with the place, changing the style but still keeping much of the classic.</Review>

<text>It can be very loud  with all the conversations going on. Had the enchiladas 1 ea of the meats and mixed sauces. Really  good. Went thru 3 bowls of hand made chips, 2 bowls of salsa, 1 order of guacamole & chips, 3 glasses of tea and the 3 enchiladas and left not stuffed ,but just right. Staff is very friendly.  Definitely  will come back to try the other items
Have been back 2 more times now and the food  is just as good. Tried the Burrito  and the nachos. The nachos will feed 2+ easley<//text>< pictures>

They are just beginning a remodel (I can't wait to come back when its done), so everything is take-out now and cash only, which actually worked out perfectly for me.  I ordered a Wet Burrito and it was HUGE!!  Easy enough for 2 people to share WITH leftovers.  This is a great little family place that I'll be coming back to!  Excited to see after the remodel.  The new owner is one of the friendliest I've met and took the time to chat even though other customers where waiting.  Wish I could give more than 5-stars!< /text>

This has been my favorite neighborhood joint for years. They closed down for a year to  refurbish the place, and I'm so thrilled that it's better than ever.</Text>

I went for a quick lunch but it wasn't. Only one server although very nice but slow nonetheless. I got the Chile rellenos but I didn't like it. The cheese was oozy like liquid and it was served with a sauce that seems to have tomatoes and Velveeta together. I don't mean to be harsh. I'm willing to give it a second chance. I'll try the fish  tacos the next time.</Text>

< Review>
Food and service normally fantastic except for tonight.  There were 3 other couples seated when we got there, 2 were eating, 2 had given their orders and were waiting for food and the last two were waiting to give their orders as were we. We gave our order and then waited over 40 minutes for our food while the 3 people working concentrated on setting up tables for two large parties that were coming in, not there but coming in. They threw our order together without paying attention, my combination plate came with a salad which I did not get and my husband requested the guacamole on the side however, they put it IN his burrito. It's a good thing he is not allergic but just does not like avocados! When I brought this to the attention of the owner his response was "you could have left any time you wanted!" I am very disappointed because as I said this place is usually excellent in service and food. I guess just not when they have large parties coming in.<//Review>

The food was so good! My husband and I went before the crowd came, it was cozy and quite. The young waiter was really cool and his mom who worked in the back made the food just right. Chips and salsa was on point.<//review>

My dad and. Used to meet here a lot for lunch.. it's down the street from his house. Its a big place but it's not crazy noisey or packed like El Torito. It's a nice family restaurant. Every time we went they remembered dad and what he ordered. Now he's in a home and I go by to pick up dinner for him once in a while. It's always been his favorite place. The owner is amazing, the staff are friendly and work very hard. The food is tasty and filling!<//Text>

I wish I could give them less than one 🌟 star. Food is so flavorless and stale!
For those people who thinks that this is authentic mexican food let me tell you that you probably grow up eating at Chipotle or chevy's. Anyways...I'm not coming back to this place!

This place is great!! I actually came in looking for a tool that would remove a stripped screw from my electric skateboard and Randy takes a look at it, puts it on his workbench and in about 5 seconds he had it out. And the guy's so awesome he didn't even charge me for the removal! Now that's customer service and just dog gone nice. Thanks Randy! I'll be back in for some gardening tools I need and anything else tool wise in the future. You guys rock.</review>

<Text>Lots of used tools, including NOS stuff. Some new stuff as well. Name brands as well as generic. They have tool parts as well. No prices are posted so just make them an offer you can't refuse. Looks like they get fresh product in all the time, so browse and enjoy. People are nice, too.< /Text></record>

I've had a few tools repaired at M & M Tools.  They fixed the ones worth fixing for a reasonable charge and didn't charge me anything for examining the tools that were too far gone.  Definitely will use them in the future< /text>

I've been here a handful of times and each time Randy & Shelly were super helpful and friendly. I've turned into somewhat of a tool collector, so to me this place is a hidden gem, they have EVERYTHING.
Support your local small business, avoid the big name chains and save money. Thanks Randy!</review>

This is the place I bought my power washer at I highly recommend this place and they're great negotiators they did makes a little bit of money off me I was okay with that cuz of the fact the way the guy told me it was pretty amazing how you sold me and got me down off a hundred bucks off of it but you know he was saying he wasn't making much money off it when I know it's somebody probably was meth out of their head and just sold them that for like twenty bucks and they just got like $200 off him from me but I'm okay with that was pretty cool experience I highly recommend this to anybody if you want to go to a place to get a good price and negotiate down to a very very good Price Cleaner pawn shops are we all know how that goes thank you so much M&M tools have a great day and I hope you< /text>

I can not speak highly enough about the owners and the store itself. I have utilized this store for 2 decades. Marty and Randy the owners (father & son) are 2 of my favorite peopLe on the planet. They are helpful and kind and always greet you with genuine enthusiasm. I can not recommend a better tool shop.<//Text>

Great store with so many things to look at. They are a mom and pop shop with so much knowledge about anything tool related. They even fix tools which saved me tons of money and hasle of finding a new one. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who needs assistance, opinions, or great customer service.<//Review>

The best place in the City of Los Angeles too buy or sell tools. The proprietor is extremely fair and knowledgeable, and the prices are the best anywhere. The other reviewer who implied that the owner is racist is completely unfounded. I won't go anywhere else for tools.<//review>

In a world of corporate monsters it is nice to find a place that you can trust and somewhere where you know you are going to get great service and a personalized experience. This place is just that. The staff is incredibly knowledgable and willing to go the extra mile to make sure you get what is right for you. I honestly appreciate a place where I can simply find a staff member just to ask a question or two, but it is a major bonus when that staff is committed to each and every sale. If you want an experience that is not only painless, but also helpful, stop by here for that mythical customer service atmosphere. It is not a myth at M & M Tools. Tell Randy I said hi.</text>

<Review>If you are going to check out this place M&M tools,  it's the last place you want to buy. The people are rude and bored out of their minds with a lot of old junk-tools. Just go next door to Home Depot and buy a good quality tool with warranty. Don't waste your time and money with those guys.</Review><userid>102216210343951147518</userid>< rate>

<text>Excellent customer service and knowledgeable people. I walked in there, told them my project and they knew exactly what tool I needed. Never had that at Home Depot or Lowes. And I even got some used tools at a great price! This place is the spot for all your diy tool needs!< /text><Time>1511636775331</Time><name>jason cintra<//name><gmap_id>0x80c299f7d5410e9b:0xdccc01b7c56f049c< /gmap_id>< resp>

I hate walking into any kind of tool shop or home improvement store. I always feel like I’ll be taken advantage of because I’m a woman. So I was hesitant when I was told about this M&M Tools. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted graciously by a charming man, Randy. I love that he wasn’t all “salesman-y”. He was genuinely wanting to help me and was happy doing so. He was very knowledgeable about tools and offered his honest opinion on things. I highly recommend this place if you’re a beginner “DYI’er” and if you don’t want be “nickel and dimed”. I will be sending all my friends and family to this place. And make sure Randy helps you!<//Review>

Cachete tacos have a lot of flavor...recommend. The meat is prepared using steam/vapor.</text>

<userid>115599322917590134767</userid><Text>Me gusta los tacos muchos.. y ya tienen burritos! Estan buenos pero no estan muy grande. Tambien la horchata, esta buena pero la grande no esta muy grande.

This is my spot when I have a hankering for tacos. It's tacos al vapor (steam cooked tortillas) it's a little different from your typical  taco tortilla but in a good way. The only 2 I've tried there are the Asada tacos and Cabeza. Also, the horchata is good. I get it to go with everything on the side.
Hot sauces are good.. green one is a very low spice avocado sauce..
The second sauce is like a habanero sauce.. Very spicy so be careful.<//Text>< user_name>

<rating>4<//rating><review>Their tacos are pretty good,  a little small but for $1.29 seems ok, except lengua, One taco will cost you twice as much.
As for me I'm happy with asada, cabeza (head meat), labio(beef lip), and cachete (beef cheek). Al vapor means steamed soft tortillas and their salsas are good, warning- habanero is hot af! Be careful.
Overall a good option.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) I do not recommend it, my son ate tacos there and says they are very bad, my brother-in-law also ate there and they hurt him, finally my husband went shopping often and for 40 dollars they gave him less than half a pot, he was without taste without color and also did not smell good, I do not recommend it 👎👎👎👎

(Original)
No lo recomiendo, mi hijo comió tacos ahí y dice que están muy malos, mi cuñado también comió ahí y le hicieron daño, por último mi esposo fue a comprar menudo y por 40 dólares le dieron menos de la mitad de una olla ,estaba sin sabor sin color y además no tenía buen olor, no lo recomiendo 👎👎👎👎< /Text>

<text>We ordered 6 muscovy, and all were fine, still are. But there were 8 chicks included that were not part of our order. They're doing fine as well, but that seems like the kind of mistake one may notice before shipping them. Anyone else receive extra chicks or ducklings?< /text></record></dataset><record>

To begin with I placed an order, only to call a few minutes later and change it with an additional gosling. When my goslings hatched I received an email with a projected delivery date so that I was able to prepare. The birds arrived in good condition after traveling completely across the country from coast to coast. They are growing well and I even received a follow up email checking on them. I would recommend Metzer Farms and will remember them if I have future poultry needs.</Review>< Resp>

I ordered two female baby geese (African Greys) and they were shipped to me in the Houston, TX area. They arrived as expected and were healthy upon arrival.  I also ordered the vitamin pack and used that for awhile. The geese are growing fast and continue to be healthy and happy.  The customer service has also been great. They have emailed me to see how my geese are doing.  I would definitely buy from this company again.<//Text>

I ordered them on a Saturday and they shipped late Tuesday. They gave me a tracking number which didn’t really update but that wasn’t a concern. I’m from Illinois and I got my birds within two days! (Picked up on Thursday) I Went by the post office early in the morning when they called me, I found all birds alive and healthy! The packaging they were in was very neat and they had all the necessities they needed for two days! I will be ordering from here  again later on! If you have dead birds, don’t blame it on the farm, it’s your local postal service!</text></record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>The first batch of Cornish cross from Metzer Farm will be harvested this Saturday and the 2nd batch will be coming out of the brooder. Both batches are healthy and growing like crazy! Great birds and a great experience working with the folks in the office.  I've had quite a bit of trouble sourcing good quality meat birds through other hatcheries, especially lately.  Im so glad I found Metzer Farms and hope we have a long relationship.  Thank you guys so much.<//Review>< pics>

<text>In February of 2021 I placed an order through MyPetChicken.com for 12 ducklings to be delivered in mid March. When the shipment day came and went without an email from the company, I called their customer service. I was told that orders are filled by Metzer in California and they couldn't fill my order that week and apologized for not contacting me. They said they would fill my order the next week. When our ducklings did arrive they were all dead!
I called and they offered to replace our order. I offered to pay for expedient shipping and was told they only ship Priority Mail. We scheduled it for a few weeks later because we were hoping warmer weather would insure their survival. They shipped our order this past Monday. It arrived today (Friday) and once again, all the ducklings are dead.
I called customer service and they quickly put in a request for a full refund.
While customer service was understanding and easy to deal with, this should never have happened...especially TWICE!
We will never order from them again!!< /text>< pics>

I got some Indian Runner ducks from Metzer Farms, and one of the ones they sent me was a runt with an eye infection and her legs didn't work.  She died after a couple of days.  I was pretty disappointed that they sent me a duck that was clearly struggling so much, but they replaced her and sent another duckling companion too.  The new ducklings are energetic and healthy, and I appreciate them fixing the situation.  Also, I love all my ducks from Metzer Farms, and overall am really happy.  I love that you can pick specific colors, and their selection is really good.< /review>

The Ducklings shipped Tuesday and made it in less than 2 days all the way to South Carolina.  All 10 were alive and healthy and are thriving!< /Review>

When ordering birds through the mail it’s always a 50/50 chance of a good experience or a terrible one. Our birds arrived early morning at the post office where I picked them up immediately. We only ordered 2 female Cayuga ducks, we’re in NC they came from CA. They shipped Monday night and arrived Wednesday early. We’re thrilled with our choice to use Metzer Farms! The ducks arrived happy and healthy and were eating and drinking within minutes of being in their brooder. I wouldn’t normally write this review but I use Instagram and the hate this company is receiving on social media is outrageous.<//text>

I ordered seven mixed female ducklings for them. Sadly I had one pass away and another didn't look so well. I contacted them and I got a response within 15 minutes. Ashley helped me and was so nice. She apologized and helped resolve the issue for the ducking that passed. She also gave me recommendations for the duckling that was looking out of it.
I have ordered from other hatcheries before and have never had as good of an outcome as what I have with Metzer Farms. I will definitely be ordering from them again in the future.</text>

I ordered 3 Embden Goslings.  They shipped exactly when Metzer Farms said they would.  They arrived happy, healthy, and vibrant!  I was very pleased with how informative Metzer Farms was during this process.  They sent me an email on how to prepare for my goslings about a week before they were scheduled to hatch and ship.  They also informed me that even though I would be receiving a tracking number that USPS isn't very good about updating the shipment and often times it will show as the shipment still has not left Gonzales, CA.  They were correct and I really appreciated this information because I would have been a hot mess expecting my birds and not knowing where they were.  Thank you Metzer Farms!<//text>

It sounds like they care about their birds, but I was surprised at the way they shipped the babies. I could see no precautions that were taken to keep the babies safe. They were basically in a box with holes and some straw on the bottom. Evidently whatever food or water supplement they had put in the box ran out because out of 8 birds, two of the birds were dead and one was very sick and died a day later. The ones still alive in the box were pecking at each other out of sheer hunger. Metzer Farms had sent us an email that said to contact them if we had any problems with our shipment.  But after contacting them about the loss they were silent. No response and no refund. I don’t know how to make a safer box, but they really need to add extra food supplements to make sure the babies have enough to survive the trip. I definitely won’t order from them again.</text>

Great Meat birds and shipped very well. Ordered 25 cornish cross.  shipped on a Monday, received on Wednesday morning at the  post office.  Shipping box was strong and in good shape.  Still had gro gel in box.  They shipped 26, had 1 dead on arrival.  Lost another bird because it got too hot and got pasty butt - our fault - not the hatchery.  Lost another bird at about 3.5 weeks - don't know the reason, it was just dead in the morning.  All other birds were healthy, grew very well - we fed 19% from start to finish - and we butchered at 7.5 weeks.  Did not pluck, we skinned.  Average finished bird was 6-7lb roosters and 4.5-5.5lb hens. Great looking and TASTING meat!  Just placed another order for 30.  Would definitely recommend.</text>

<text>I purchase three ducks from metzer farms extremely happy with my service and what I paid is no different than what I’ve paid at another places with not such good results, that place they just sent three ducks in a box no water nothing to sustain them, newborn ducks  high and dry for three days of travel.

BUT The ducks from Metzer farm  arrived in three days with 2 cups of a water type gel for them to drink while they’re in travel amazing they totally care about their ducks and they arrived  extremely healthy, eating happy baby ducks I give metzer farm high props they’re definitely a five star or above business I highly recommend them if you want to buy ducks buy them from Metzer Duck Farm<//text><name>Darlene<//name><gmapID>0x80920d0c6f4b4379:0x18efb90025f305ef<//gmapID><response>None<//response></record>

If I could leave zero stars I would. All 3 of my ducklings arrived dead this morning.  Cold and dead. This is cruel and horrible. I cannot express how traumatic it was opening a silent box and finding all the ducks dead. I am still waiting to hear back from SOMEBODY. I have read reviews and have found this is a common occurrence. I truly believe this is animal abuse and a company that does not care about the welfare of animals should not be allowed to operate. I receive plants in the mail shipped warmer and with more care than living ducks. I am disappointed and so so sad.<//Review>

Ordered four waterfowls two died when they arrived and then one was unable to walk then had a seizure and died. Then the last who seemed perfectly fine running around and happy died a couple hours later. The box they came in was very small, had a little heat warmer, and almost no food. Also the two that died when they arrived had been dead for some time. Are not gonna order replacement ducklings. I suggest you don’t buy from them in the first place.</text>

These ducklings are hardier than CornishX chickens but finish in only 7 weeks! Packing is great, and mortality is close to zero when the Priority package arrives by Day 3. Yet when USPS doesn't come through, Metzer does.<//Review>< GmapID>

I don't write reviews usually but future customers should be warned. I bought three ducklings that arrived dead. Called them up to discuss the matter and was greeted by a downright rude woman. She constantly would talk over me every time I tried to speak. She even started to get loud with me. At no time did I get disrespectful or raise my voice. When asked if I could talk to some one else that would treat me the way they would like to be treated I was told there was no one else and tough luck. I'd love to have a cordial conversation with someone in charge there. This isn't how to treat people. I have a feeling if it wasn't for the distance between us and I was in front of her she wouldn't have treated  me, the paying customer, that way. Easy to talk tough and rude when you are 1,000s of miles away. They lost my business sadly enough all because of a downright nasty employee.</Review>

I was hesitant to order with all the reviews but after talking to others (I'm a new duck Mom) I learned all hatcheries ship priority mail and prior to the pandemic, no issues were had from friends I new who ordered from here. Also of the many hatcheries I looked at, this one had the best reviews, and had been in business the longest. After placing my order, I decided to change it so called and spoke to a sweet woman who answered on the first ring. She was very kind and helpful. So as of reviews saying they don't answer the phone, I didn't personally have that issue. We got 11 ducks and one passed away the day after arriving. I called and spoke to another nice woman and she gave me my options, asked about my other ducks, and apologized for my sweet duck that passed away. As for usps....I have had many issues! Wouldn't answer the phone, shipping didn't update, wasn't open on time to get my ducks, the list went on and on. I personally would have paid to overnight my ducks if that was an option,  all in all we had a good experience a d the people at Metzer have been great!<//text>

<text>I have been waiting weeks to receive my new Fawn and White runner ducks, built them a home with a pond. I get the call this morning that the post has them ready to pick up, upon arrival the post office employee says they haven’t made a sound so she doesn’t believe they are alive. I open the box and sadly they have all died, huddled together on top of a heat pack that’s cold. The ducklings arrived in the correct time frame, the heat pack should have still been warm. This kind of disregard for life is unacceptable and the packaging needs to be more seriously considered by this company. Very disappointed in the situation and customer services lack of empathy.</text>< Pictures>

Today I received a call from my Postal Service advising of the deceased jumbo Peking ducks I purchased. I tracked the order the entire time, and realized something was wrong when six days later I hadn’t received anything. I don’t know what methods they use to send these animals in, but this is not worth an animal‘s life! If you are going to order from this farm, be mindful of what you are about to put these animals through. I am deeply saddened and remorseful for what the part I played in these deaths.<//text>

This is the first time I've ordered from this company and the last. Extremely poor customer service. No one answers the phone. Left messages but no return calls. Emailed them. No reply. I ordered 10 ducks and 6 goslings. They arrived in separate shipments and a day apart even though they were shipped the same day. One of the goslings was in poor health and died the next day. There were no heat packs in either order. The green food gel was totally gone in both boxes. So far the other ducklings and goslings seem to be ok.</Text>

<text>I developed colitis and it turned out I was sensitive to chicken eggs after a lifetime of eating them. I tried duck eggs and did not have a reaction, but duck eggs are hard to find on a consistent basis. I ordered 20 duck eggs from Olinday farms and could not be happier. They arrived within two days of my order, all intact, and they taste terrific. I'm a customer for life.<//text>< pictures>

Orederd two jumbo pekins and a black runner duck.when they arrived the runner was dead. We called and were talked to by a rude lady and lost connection. Have not heard back from them. I have emailed them twice and still no reply. The heat pack was cold when they arrived. It took 3 days to ship them to us. I do not suggest purchasing anything from this company. They do not have any customer service if it requires not taking your mo ey.<//text>

Ordered 8 Silver Appleyards (2 drakes).  They arrived in 36hrs (cross-country) and the post office called promptly at 6:05 after just opening.
Brooder setup is perfect (we raise chickens also).  After an hour home 2 appeared to become lethargic but all continued to take water (+Sav-a-Chick) and starter crumble (+brewers yeast).  Measured 95° under far end of Brisnea heat plate... Everything's perfect.
I looked in on them every other hour, letting them rest.  Twelve hours after receipt I checked on them again to find one dead, not one of the lethargic ones either.  Two hours later I held one of the drakes as he took his last breath.  Close to midnight, I held a duck as she died also.  The remaining 5 were all lively, active and eating/drinking.  I check early in the morning and 1 had distanced herself from the other 4, she was preparing to die too.  She passed an hour ago.  I've called the hatchery 4 times in the past 2 hours and left a message through their webpage and I cannot get ahold of them.

I fully expect the remaining 4 to die also and I cannot figure out why.  I'm just ensuring they're comfortable while we await the inevitable, and praying.  I suspect either something viral, they caught a chill because of the lack of a sufficient heat pack in the box (it was so small and ice cold after 36 hours) or they're just not healthy coming from this hatchery.

I will be requesting a refund and ordering from a more reputable hatchery, with better reviews, that charges more for shipping and gets them here overnight.< /text>

If I could I’d leave 0 stars. 40 birds shipped Monday and never got to the post office for pick up till Friday morning. All dead. Of course my pregnant wife had to be the one to pick up this disaster. Will never order from here again. Buyers beware. They blame shipping end to be the problem when they are not being responsible and send overnight. Poor communication and just overall terrible experience.</text>

<Text>UPDATE:
My sabastopol gosling has now died.
When the company called back about the muscovy losses I told them about the gosling not being right also. They suggested electrolytes. I asked how electrolytes would help with a deformity and got no answer just "keep us updated". I will. Trust me.
It's outrageous to pay that kind of money for such a poor product. Not to mention the birds that had to endure.

First time ordering from this company since my trusted hatchery was sold out early this year. Ordered 8 muscovy ducklings and one sebastopol gosling. 4 arrived dead, one died two hours later and another that night. The gosling is eating and drinking however seems like it may have problems or a deformity . We'll see as time goes on. Still waiting to hear back from Metzer , unfortunately you can only leave a message but I want a refund ASAP. Not worth the $150.00 for over half my order dying. Will never again use this company. Buyer beware!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Ordered 4 ducks 2 came dead on arrival shipping took 4 days which is horrible for live animals this should have been overnighted or 2 days at the most also no response to my email an it's been a couple weeks now. Will not order again animals shouldn't have to suffer an die due to poor shipping especially when they charge you $40 for shipping.< /Review>

For everyone writing negative reviews, its not the hatchery, its the post office. Go give the USPS a one star review. All the birds I've ordered from Metzer Farms have been healthy except for when the post office can't handle them right, and keeps them in a room with no ventalation and delays my delivery by two days past the expected date. This is when I get losses.</text>

<date>1590771801155</date><Rating>5< /Rating><review>Great experience. We ordered four female ducks for our drake and at first we were taken aback by the hefty small order fee - but we understood because good livestock isn't cheap. So we paid it, because that meant to us that we were getting quality animals and service - and that turned out to be true!

Shipping ducks can be tricky, we knew that going in. So when one sadly did not survive the trip, we let Alexis know. She offered us a refund or replacement and we chose replacement.

The new duck was delivered healthy - WITH A FREE TRAVEL BUDDY SO IT WOULDN'T GET LONELY - within a week. They wouldn't even let us help pay for the additional shipping.

10/10 will definitely order from them again.</review>< pics>

As of right now, all appear to be female, which is what I ordered, so that's great! Really happy with the quality and shipping care.

< Review>
Bought some geese and Muscovys from them, some didn't make it but Metzer made it right and it didn't take talking to a machine for 30 min to get to them.  Props to Ashley, she was direct, professional, and handled my issue politely to my complete satisfaction within 2 minutes.

I have definitely found my preferred hatchery, if you also have high standards then I would absolutely recommend Metzer.

Only thing that I could wish for above their current marks for excellence is a variety of chickens for sale.  Of course as a predominately waterfowl hatchery I can see why they don't.<//Review>

<review>Metzer will just delay your order without warning. It looks like they must "over book" like the airlines and the small orders get pushed to the back of the line. So, I then ordered from Ideal Poultry and the ducks came in as promised.

Here is what Metzer told me the day AFTER they were supposed to ship:

"Dear Customer

Things didn't turn out quite the way we planned for your order #XXXXXX, which was scheduled to ship Monday, September 28, 2020.  The new expected shipping date is Tuesday, October 13, 2020.  We're very sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you.  If you have any questions, you may call us at the number below during normal business hours or simply reply to this email."

Thanks, I'll order elsewhere. Be aware they don't care about your schedule, only theirs.</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

A recent order of ducklings arrived with one duck not included in the order. I reached out for help with replacing the duckling and perhaps ordering a few more. In response to my polite email it was insinuated that I was lying about the missing duck. Further correspondents continued to be rude and very unhelpful. It's too easy to order online from anywhere to be bothered with unhelpful and rude companies.</review>

<text>I do not like giving 1 star reviews. So I won't. The shipping was fast. The eggs looks to be packaged nicely. One of the eggs rotted within the first 2 weeks. 6 were infertile, 4 partially developed, and 1 hatched. I followed all of the instructions to the T. I did not candle them at 14 days as instructed on the sheet. This was a mistake.

IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE THIS COMPANY, MAKE SURE TO CANDLE TH EGGS OR THEY WILL NOT REFUND YOU... NO MATTER WHAT.

I just assumed that 90+% of them would not be duds. I called to ask the company if they would consider a percent off of the next order in order to retain me as a customer, even conceding to just 20% off (which I think is fair, due to the eggs costing me approximately 50 bucks) and they said no. The lady on the phone was super nice, but was giving me the information provided by her supervisor. I asked them point blank if they would rather lose my as a future customer and have me take my business elsewhere rather than give me a discount on a future order, and they said YES.

She told me they would have refunded me if I had candled the eggs and reported them within the first 14 days. I am struggling to understand why this would make a difference. The eggs were a bad batch. It is obvious.

This is not how I do business and I hope they consider a change for future customers. They have lost my business due to this.

Changed my mind. 1 star.< /text>< Pics>

<Response>None</Response><Review>I got ordered 3 ducklings (Pekin, Cayuga, and Black Runner) and got them today. Opened the box and 2 ducklings looked fine but the 3rd one didn't look to well and as I looked inside I could see that the ducklings didn't have anymore food and I recommend Metzger farms that you fill the food cup all the way because there wasn't anything in it after I opened the box. And it's been hours and my ducklings seem perfectly fine, they were just a bit thirsty and hungry<//Review></record>

<text>My initial order was delayed, but I had ordered a bit of a variety pack of breeds and genders so that was somewhat expected. But 10 little ducklings quickly arrived well-packaged and healthy. They had been shipped with plenty of GroGel so they weren't starving when we unboxed them and the males are marked with expandable bands around their feet. They're all happy little babies and we're happy duck owners. Highly recommended!</text>< pictures>

Purchased 25 meat chickens and 5 Emden goslings. Metzer sent 30 chicks and they were hale and energetic, eating well right out of the box. Lost 3 in first 48hrs, but still have over the original total ordered and really impressed with the vim and vigor of Metzer's birds. Would absolutely order again!< /text>

I ordered a batch of ducklings which all died the day after they arrived. Metzer replaced the ducklings promptly and professionally, but the next order died over the next 10 days (most passed in the first week, then 2 more passed). I feel guilty about how inhumane their short little lives were. Metzers service was great, but their stock was sadly not.</review>

We ended up getting 9 drakes out of the 10 golden 300 ducks from a straight run. I called them and they were more than happy to give us replacements of females to match the gender ratio that should have come out of the straight run. They were quick to help! Thank you! =)</Review>

Wish I could give zero, more than half our ducklings came dead. Super upsetting. From reviews on here
DONT ORDER runners from them.

They don't do well or dont properly take care of them before transit.<//Text>< Pictures>

I ordered and paid for 32 Cornish Cross and 32 Rollin S chicks. They arrived in 2 days, as promised. When I counted out the Chicks, as I dipped each beak in the water dish, I realized that I received 34 Cornish Cross and 35 Rollin S babies. Sadly, 2 of the CC had died in transit, but the remaining chicks are healthy and busy being baby birds.

As there was no note or indication as to why, I don't know if the bonus chicks were an act of generosity or poor counting, but I'm glad for it, either way.<//Review>

I ordered 10 ducklings from them to be shipped to Cheyenne, WY as we couldn't find anywhere local to get female only birds. We got 6 of the hatchery choice and got 2 ducklings of 3 different breeds! VERY PLEASED and all our ducklings were happy and healthy (though a bit thirsty) when they arrived. We had exactly what we ordered and, again, were very happy with their condition. They shipped on Monday and arrived Wednesday morning.< /Text>

Great communication! Great business! Got everything  I ordered and babies are healthy and growing fast! The staff helped ease my concern about shipping so far away. I live in the Midwest. Guess my babies had only half as far to travel as most of them! Great job Metzer! Would not hesitate to do business here again.< /text>

I ordered a small order of only four Black Swedish ducks and was concerned about the shipping with such a small batch. But they arrived right on time at the post office and when we picked them up they were in excellent condition and have now had them four a year and have never had a problem with their health. I was impressed with the quality of the ducklings and the kindness that customer service showed me when I called about some shipping details. Overall I highly suggest them to anyone looking to get just a few ducks and larger quantities.< /text>

I bought three types of ducks from them.  One of the types was the chocolate runner.  The first order all 4 died of the runner ducks and one of our Peking came dead. Then they replaced them and the runners died again. All except one so far.  Seemed a bit rediculous.  One of them had seizures which I looked up can be from the hatchery improper incubation.<//Text>

Ordered 11 eggs, 4 Pekin, 4 Rhouen, and 3 Welsh Harlequin. They were shipped promptly. I put them in the incubator, and candled them 7 days later. Only 5 showed signs of life. I emailed the company and was told to wait until monday and call if there were still only 5. I called, and was told to give it a little more time. Called two more times and left messages, but no response. They ducklings hatched in the last couple days, but only five, 3 Rhouen and 2 Pekin. The others never developed. I contacted them again and got a very rude response saying it was my fault for not contacting them promptly. The problem is, I DID contact them....4 times. Very disappointed. I love the little ones that hatched, but it definitely wasnt 80% fertility like promised.< /review>

In my 9th grade biology class we did an imprinting experiment where we were going to hatch ducks from eggs and then raise them as our own children. We ordered the eggs, waited the right amount of time AND NOT A SINGLE EGG HATCHED. Our teacher contacted the company and they agreed to send a batch of live chicks, which would still work for our experiment EXCEPT THEY ALL HAD SEIZURES AND DIED IN OUR LITTLE 14 YEAR OLD HANDS! After this happened, I emailed the company and still, four years later have not received a response, and an obviously still salty.< /text>

Due to unknown extended delivery time, one or more ducklings would arrive dead or ill.   Not the fault of Metzer farms (I live in a very very rural area).     However, when I explained the situation they sent another two ducklings at no cost and with extra food and they new additions were healthy and well.   Great place to do business with and I won’t order my ducklings anywhere else<//Review>

Out of an order of 18 different ducks, 4 are alive. They died horrible ways. It was a inbreeding problem. I contacted metzer and they pretty much wanted me to take them to a poultry vet. I talked to my vet and several others and they all said inbreeding. I did everything they said and nothing saved them. This was 2 years ago. I found metzer unconcerned and really wanted blame not on them. The 2 that are alive have problems but are managing. I did the niacin and all the other vitamins they told me. They died... buyer beware.<//Text>

We ordered a couple of female Buff Orpington ducks. We drove a few hours to pick them up. They were ready to go when we got there. And gel for hydration, grass hay for nesting and a heat pack. It has been a month and the girls are doing great with our other two pikins< /text>

Ordered 6 Golden 300 Hybrids. Unfortunately, 1 was DOA. (Traveled from CA to TX) You could tell she had just died before I picked them up. Metzer offered to replace with 2 ducklings or give a refund. I chose the refund. All other ducklings were healthy. Metzer has been great about answering all my questions the first few weeks. Very pleased with the service and my ducks.<//review>

We ordered a  6 duck day old mix from them that they hatched Jan 2nd. Shipped all the way to wisconsin when it was 0° (I wouldn't recommend that) they sent 7! Well it's March 29th and all are alive and doing great! They were in great shape when we got them. If my incubating doesnt go as planned they will be the only place we ever order from again<//Text>

I ordered goslings and ducklings on a Friday, less than a week in advance, and they all showed up healthy and alive. Before ordering, I called ahead and they said my order would be hatching on Monday, shipping out the same day, and ariving on Wednesday. Sure enough, I got the call from the post office at 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday morning that they were ready for pickup. I live in Iowa so it was a long distance, but all the birds were alive and chirping, and exactly what I ordered. Very pleased.</Text>

A computer glitch caused my goslings to be sent to my old address from a previous order eight years ago, despite the confirmation e-mail having my current address. I know this is not the norm, I have never had a problem or even heard bad things about Metzer Farms. However, this caused the birds to spend about 4.5 days in transit. My original post office forwarded them to my current address before I even knew they had been there. The people at Metzer were so incredibly nice and caring about the situation. I was impressed that they admitted their mistake quickly and apologized immediately. When I called again on Friday morning, they put a replacement in for me when we were still unable to locate the goslings. That afternoon, the post office called me and said that the birds had finally arrived and two (of three) were still alive! They were not making noise or moving much. USPS fed and watered the goslings, so by the time I received them they were standing and peeping! The roman tufted looked very shaky, but he perked up quickly! I was amazed that the female toulouse they sent was in such great shape.

I called Metzer to tell them two of the birds had survived, but they insisted on sending the full replacement order anyhow! I have to say, this was a very difficult week but the kindness and helpfulness of the people at Metzer made it a little easier to get through. I don't blame them for what was obviously a computer glitch. Instead I am impressed with their customer service and desire to make things right with customers! You can tell they run a reputable business and stand behind their name and their birds. I would definitely recommend them to anyone and plan on using them in the future for all my waterfowl (and etc...) needs!</Text>

The note attached to my order stating I wanted "any off-white Crested Pekings, and if there were none, regular whites would be acceptable" was taken to mean that it was fine to short me the Crested Pekings when Metzer's hatch was not up to their expectations. Not only did Metzer make zero attempt to contact me before changing my order, when I called them the morning they were due to start shipping they didn't even try to get my name to pull my order up.

Just to make it clear: they altered my order without my permission, without even TRYING to contact me first, and then rudely brushed me off on the phone when I contacted them.

Afterwards they LIED and claimed they had tried to contact me, rather than dismissing me on the phone without bothering to get my name or pull up the order in question.

Zero effort was made to correct the issue- the best they were able to manage was refunding me for the DEAD duckling I got in my COMPLETELY BUTCHERED order.

This is an incompetent, unprofessional business which will happily try to rob you blind then blame you for it.< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80920d0c6f4b4379:0x18efb90025f305ef<//gmap_id></record>

<rate>1< /rate><text>I have been quite disappointed with the Welsh Harlequin ducks I bought from this breeder. Their genetic line has obvious mutations that are not good to perpetuate within an endangered species like the WH's (yellow bills, feathers growing on the legs, etc). I know they aren't considered "show quality", but it's bad breeding practice to continue these traits. Also, I ordered straight run ducks and was hoping to get a more even cut between males and females in my flock. I did not and I believe it is because they sexed all the ducks and filled the orders for specific male/female orders and then put the left over ducks (mainly males) into the straight-run category. Doing this is not being honest with the customer and what they ordered.

Overall, I will not be ordering from this company again and I do not recommend anyone else order from them either. Even when I called to clarify on the amount of males I received and to see if I could get a refund or some more females they were very short with me and spoke to me as if I were stupid.

4 khaki Campbells
4 welsh harlequins
6 indian runners
And I waited inpatiently for them to hatch! I was so excited to meet them but I knew they all wouldn't make it sadly. The khakis, and welsh ducks did amazing! They were basically jumping out of their shells. We named one tigger he was so bouncy from day one. But the runners kept dying. One by one I had to bury fully formed ducks half out of their shell. Which I knew would happen sadly. We did get 2 amazing little runners though! 1 black and one yellow! They were great but the black one was having trouble. The next day the yellow one died out of no where.  Then that night (on father's day) the black one died. We were all heart broken. I called the farm to see if I could get a new batch because clearly the runners had very bad health issues. But a woman on the phone coldly said that happens, we breed thousands so who knows. Not sure what to do now. Just feel so sad.<//Text>< username>

I ordered 5 varieties of ducks from them, 10 in all. All were healthy except one that looked like it may have been a little smaller than the rest. She didn't take long to perk up however. When they started laying I did loose one, not to egg binding, but it may have been the same one that arrived weak because it was the same breed.
However, I had ordered them 2 years ago on Aug 20, 2014 and the rest have been strong and healthy and egg laying happy. Whenever I've dealt with anyone on the phone from there they've always been nice and helpful.
I'm thinking of getting pekins to raise as meat and I will be getting them from Metzers if I do. Other people I've talked to that have ordered waterfowl from them have also been happy with them. Would definatly recommend to anyone wanting waterfowl. And the duck I lost was not any fault of Metzers, just an unfortunate occurrence.</review>

(Also, I forgot my mask and another awesome staff shared one that she had extra-sweet!)
thanks nugget staff!

I've been here a couple times... it's nice. I received this with a cheese board for christmas but when I opened it, it was horrible. I am really disappointed that this was meant to be sold by 12/23/2020 which it may have been, but the new sticker said sell by 1/1/2021. You can even see the mold through the paper... This is really disgusting and sadly I live too far to replace it. I was really looking forward to this gouda, please do better.< /review>

This is my favorite Nugget Market of all! I try to make a point of stopping in whenever I come in to Woodland and it never disappoints. I have done my grocery shopping here in the past and wish we had one in Carmichael. This time my daughter and I stopped by for lunch. First off, they have a great coffee bar with delicious drinks. I got my caffeine fix with an awesome Iced Caramel Machiatto! We then checked out the deli where I chose a turkey/ bacon/avocado sandwich. It was delicious! There is a wide selection of premade sandwiches, salads, entrees, etc. I will be back again soon!< /text>

But that's what perfection is worth . It seems to all look great from the floors, the goods , the fresh veges an fruit. As well as every store worker I laid my eyes on ..

Beautiful as always< /review>< Pics>

I'm sure I'm not the first to say as this is the original location but the store is even more amazing than a lot of thier other locations just because it's so beautiful and the people are just so helpful. 4 people offered me help and I found out things I would have never known. If you're looking to get something special to make coming home something to look forward to come here and the staff will help you find a new healthy vice!</review>< pictures>

<Text>Beautiful clean exceptionally kept store. Very impressed with selection. Enjoyed their kitchen trying Asian garlic chicken while staring at a showcase of cakes and tarts. Took home a huge piece of Carrot Cake which pairs terrifically with a Jan 2020 Milk.</Text>< pictures>

Great selection of beers.. just.. y'all need more cashiers working. Lines were down the aisles and only two registers open.  Can't say it's Covid related because both registers were next to each other. 😂🤣 At least there was social distancing though in the lines!!</Text>

<Review>Nugget market is always pleasant to shop in!  The displays are tidy and attractive and the store is dependably stocked with lots of the regular stuff as well as local and organic choices.

<response>{'time': 1620311660733, 'text': 'Hello Lawrence, thanks very much for shopping with us and for sharing your thoughts. It’s true we carry a lot of specialty items (e.g. organics, gluten free) that tend to come with slightly higher costs. However, we also regularly survey other markets to ensure our overall item-to-item pricing is competitive. If you have concerns about specific products, we’d be glad to look into them for you. Also, the great news is our bakery’s fresh scratch-made cheese bagels are $1.99 apiece, and those bagels without cheese are only $1.50. Our 6-count bagel packages are $7.99 each, except for the plain which are $6.99. Have a terrific day, and we hope to serve you again soon.'}</response>< name>

<Text>If you want to spend 10 on a bagel this place is for you. By far the most expensive market in town   why?  Because that's who they are   if you're middle class trying to live on a budget this place would blow that budget out<//Text>< userid>

This place is super cute and clean. Sanitization products(wipes, etc) are available for customers as well. The staff are friendly and ready to help. They have a wide selection of groceries including healthy brands. Most stores only have small sections of the healthy brands but they carry A LOT of them. Great meat(and non-meat) selections. This is my new grocery store for sure.< /text>

One of the best supermarkets in CA! Im from the Bay Area and I prefer this to any Whole Foods. What separates them is their level of service and sandwich bar!< /Review>

Shelves are empty and prices are through the roof. Nugget is price gouging as people stock up during a pandemic and to prepare for the shelter in place. Shameful. Will not be returning.

Edit: Tylenol 24 count was $5.39! Progresso Traditional Chicken Noodle Soup was $3.29 per can at Nugget. Same can of progresso soup at Savemart was $2.50. You are selling the same can of soup for 31% more on the day shelter-in-place came out. Shame!
I asked the cashier if prices had gone up and the cashier said, well demand is high so we can raise our prices.
You say, "we’d never take advantage of our guests, especially during a time of crisis." I will let other customers judge if you are taking advantage of your guests.

Finally, you also made all sales final, but do not tell anyone until they get their receipt. Then you only find out if you read the second to bottom line of the receipt so you cannot even return the overpriced goods to buy them elsewhere.<//review>

I love the Nugget! Great food and products, awesome, friendly staff and cool decor. In Woodland, they pretty much have the best selection of craft beer and specialty food. Their deli, bakery and hot foods are restaurant quality. I've visited every single Nugget across the Sacramento Valley and I've noticed that the Woodland location often introduces new products and ideas at this location first. Though not my favorite Nugget Market, the Woodland location is the best place to buy food and adult beverages in town.< /Text>

<review>Nugget Market what can say that has not already been said. I use a walker I don't drive anymore.it's nice to have a E-cart to shop with Nugget always has one charged and ready I know luck has a lot to do with the availability.Still Nugget always seems to be working to keep customer satisfaction at a high level.Yes you might pay more that's fine by me Nugget has great service.and wide isles I don't feel comfortable with that machine anyway I watch were I'm going, but stuff can happen.The E-CART is a Godsend to a disabled person, Nugget Market has a great game plan keeping the E-CART a priority  and not a mandate with cost limitations.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1555464551174, 'text': 'It’s encouraging to hear you had a great experience at our store.

<rate>5</rate><review>When i go into a store, i like to see the lay out and feel the vibe. I confess I don't like the layout, but that's a matter of preference--so noo big deal. The vibe, though, that was good 👍! I could have done w/o the loud music, but the people were nice, the customers looked content, and i felt like spending money in there. I had some interaction w/one of their staff, and she was very nice and helpful--another reason to like the store. The nugget is one of my favorite stores.<//review>< pics>

<Review>I don't live in the area, so I hadn't been in The Nugget before. I have never seen a grocery market that was SO clean. The staff, from floor people to deli counter workers and cashiers, is exceptional. The prices are slightly higher than big chain markets, but well worth the cost for the variety and quality of products.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>I Love Nugget Markets.  People really need to look at the Quality of people that work there the Quality of the Items you can purchase.  In all REALITY you can find very Reasonable prices here just like the next.  Non Gmo, Vegan etc.  Is always going to cost you a little more no matter where you go.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>I love the Nugget markets. They have everything. I stopped in today because I didnt want to drive all over for a gift card and Birthday card. Unfortunately,  I was disappointed.  The gift card could not be activated due to the implementation  of a new system  that had not been completed; day two. I would  have been helpful if a sign had been posted on the gift cards. However, I will  be back tomorrow  morning  for pastries.< /Text><time>1552531071694<//time>< GmapID>

They always have lots of specials on things I regularly buy, and when I have checked their prices against other stores they are not more expensive. Their produce is excellent and they sell items other stores don't sell, from innovative smaller companies. They have an amazing coffee drink and juice bar which serves delicious drinks where you can either caffeinate in the most delightful way or literally drink your servings of veggies. But equally important is their service. Their staff are friendly and helpful, more than at any other supermarket. The employees there seem happy and relaxed doing their jobs. Many of them are long-term employees, others are students working their way through college. Not all customers are nice to the employees, but  they still go the extra mile to help people, making sure the elderly, disabled, and really any customer gets extra assistance if they need it. I usually stop by Nugget on my bicycle to get a coffee drink and groceries, and the staff still offers to help me out to my bike with my groceries.</text></record></dataset><record>

Nugget is great, their chain hires the best staff. But it's a little too "speciality" items for me, so I usually only go for the health supplements, tincture type items especially Arnica. Then do my normal weekly shopping at Food 4 Less which fits MY needs but is other side of town.

But, ironically I was sent to also pick up a 2 Liter bottle of Coke. Imagine my surprise huge shelves of every imaginable soda, and the largest were 1.75L. I laughed all the way thru the checkout for my items, and stopped at a competitor on the way home for 3 for $5.<//review>

One of my favorite places to go when I'm in the mood for a good, healthy snack. I can even use food stamps to get smoothie bowls and as a #veganonabudget it's amazing!</Text>

As always, Nugget continually offers the very finest in quality products and excellence in their shopping experience.

Ask today at the customer service desk about their $10 gold coins. One of the best gifts ever in my book. ;)</Review>

This is the best grocery store in the sac area. I’m a poor shopper though. I keep pulling items off the soup and bread shelves thinking the price in front of me is the purchase price. Turns out someone forgot to turn the oatmeal sign around and the small soup was 3.99 not 2.50. 2.50 was the oatmeal. The advertised sourdough bread in the stack with the 2.99 price underneath it was really a stack of 4.99 loaves of jalapeño bread. The price was on the back of the bread and not viewable unless I examined it more closely. Just a poor shopper in a rush. Looking only at the big numbers in front of me. The problem is I always stop the transaction then and go back and look for my mistake. A friend tells me I should insist on the price if it’s in my favor but that seems like a lot of bother and badwill. Prices are more expensive here but for a health conscious person they have a good variety. Dry goods are sometimes cheaper on amazon prime.</Text>

Very nice market. Focus is more on upscale and higher quality. Prices are higher than surrounding stores, but it does have some nice features such as a coffee shop with seating.</text>

On the higher end of supermarkets. I don't really shop for groceries here, but I love visiting during my lunch. They have one of my favorite sandwiches (el diablo) and they have some delicious chicken noodle soup.

Very unhelpful and overpriced. Ex: Bought turkey for $3 pound after Christmas when later food4less has it for half the price. Workers are cold and stubborn . it’s completely opposite the what you expect and it’s run like corporate instead of your friendly neighborhood market. Will never shop here again. There seems a hidden dark force, behind running all this operation.</review>

They have all the seasonals for Lagunitas, Sierra Nevada, Knee Deep and Out of Bounds. Pretty solid choice if you want to find a beer you've never had the opportunity of trying before.</Review>< pics>

<username>Angry As Hell<//username><Text>Nugget Market, I go to the one by my house in south Sacratomato, so going to the one in Woodland is familiar territory.  They have great prepared food (for lunch, and for dinner too I suppose).  I just bought a bowl of cheddar broccoli soup, and Ohhh man that was delish.  A bowl was $5.99 +tax.  I will say though, tasty eats has its cost.  All-in-all, Nugget is a great place.<//Text><Time>1513889451742<//Time>< Response>

You mention our prices, and it’s true we carry a lot of specialty items (i.e. organics, gluten free) that come with slightly higher costs than conventional groceries. However, we regularly survey our competition (Raley’s, Safeway, Bel Air) to ensure our overall prices are comparable or lower. If you have any concerns about specific items, don’t hesitate to call our store director, Rodney Beebe (530-662-5479), as he’d always be glad to assist you. Have a great day, and we look forward to serving you again soon.'}</response>

(Translated by Google) In this place the products are top notch, the food is made daily and for that reason it is more expensive than in other places, but it is worth taking your luxuries from time to time.
