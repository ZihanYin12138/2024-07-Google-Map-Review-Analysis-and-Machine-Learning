This service provider is very professional.  Took us in early and processed papers quickly.  The person in charge, I think his name is Rudy, is very professional and made sure that everything was taken care of.  The damaged areas are unnoticeable after they have repaired it.  Looks like it just came out of the dealership :)  Nice work.<//Text></record>

My experience with this shop are excellent. They have a friendly receptionist. They always do very good work and they guarantee it. I've been to this shop several times they're that good. The last time was on 25Feb21 which Rudy was my advisor and incharge of my repairs kept me updated all the way and I got my car when promised. Would definitely recommend this shop to someone.<//Review>

My daughter's car needed a part of the bumper to be replaced. I thought I could do it, but could not. My daughter called Caliber and David told her to bring it in at 1 o'clock that day. I took it in at 1 o'clock and Robert told me that I could wait for it. It was ready in 25 minutes and was perfect. I'm very satisfied.< /text>

This Caliber shop is getting worse than what it used to be. Edwin Gualito was the estimator who wrote the original AAA estimate for some $320 to change the silver lower part of the rear bumper.  I told them his estimate was not accurate. They need to change & repaint the whole bumper cover because the middle black plastic bumper has some damage which cannot be fixed.  They kept the car for a day and came up with an excuse that they cannot match the original factory paint of the bumper.  All the bumper, sill plate & paint are original OEM. This is the most ridiculous excuse that I have ever heard of and there are bumper accidence every day.  I think they are too embarrassed to tell AAA that the new estimate will be more than $1000 for the new bumper cover & painting.  They made me do all the running and I end up going to another body shop that I used to do business with and they can do it.  Caliber goofed up big times on their estimate.  It ended up $1850 by another shop nearby and AAA will pay for it.

The owner of Caliber needs to know if their shops cannot paint bumper, what else can they do in a body shop.< /text>

From the moment I walked in, I was treated with great customer service. David at the front desk was very professional and courteous. Robert, the manager, was very accommodating and extremely generous. Lawrence, did a great job fixing and repairing my vehicle. I highly recommend this place if you need work done on your vehicle.</review>

<review>Caliber Collision Repair,  and Customer Service was awesome 👌. It looks like nothing ever happened. After my accident, I didn't make a single, call to check on my vehicle. They always sent me update status, until it was time to
Pick up my car 🤗 They did a follow-up, to check (after pickup), if everything was to my satisfaction....it was GREAT!!!🤗😃<//review>< Pictures>

We’ve been going to Caliber Collision for years. This time around was the 1st time dealing with Mike. My car was repaired, it looked really good, they did a great job. Initially, Mike was EXTREMELY rude! All in all everything worked out fine in the end.</text>

I had my front and rear bumper replacement done at this shop through insurance , but not at the same time , rear bump first and one month or so  later the front , they fix them quick and nice . But when I drive two months or so the paint begin to peel off , I found out they did not apply base for both of my bumper paint . It looks horrible then I took the vehicle back to the shop , the manager was able to repaint the bumpers for free as the warranty . This time they applied base and was durable .
But I am still not happy with the things they rush to do in the first place , how can they do not apply base for both of my bumpers ? It is not rare case obviously< /text>

Had to go back about 4 times to get the same issue fixed. Its been over two months since I got it done and had to go back 4 times. I’m very disappointed because I had to tell them what to do because they didn’t fix it.< /text>

<Review>These guys do a great job!  The whole right side of my car was wrecked, could not open or close both my doors and the mirror was hanging.  I got my car back in less than 2 weeks looking like new.  Because they are pros and really good at what they do it can get pricey if you don’t have insurance< /Review>< date>

< Review>
My car was taken here for repairs after I was hit by someone who ran a red light. The radiator needed to be replaced, but when they did that they did not put any radiator fluid into the radiator. When I drove it the check engine light came on, and the temperature shot up to maximum, which means the engine overheated.

This happened twice before I realized there was literally not a drop of radiator fluid, it was bone dry. I had my boss give me a ride to the local auto shop to get coolant to prevent any further damage to the engine. It took the entire jug, proving it had absolutely none in it. When I told this to the person that handled my case at Caliber their response was "Ok".

At this point my car is now leaking oil from a leaky seal and I am positive it was caused by the fact that I used the car for two days without radiator fluid. I brought it back in and according to them unless Toyota themselves can prove that the oil leak is related to the accident on the claim that they have no obligation to fix my vehicle because they only replaced the radiator and did not touch those seals. I am arguing that they caused severe damage to my vehicle with their neglect, and they are refusing to take responsibility for their actions by repairing that damage.

They are lucky my engine didn't seize up completely and total the car, then I would be getting a lawyer involved. I still might have to, we will see what the extent of the damage is with time. I am in contact with my insurance company at the moment and they seem to agree with me so far on this. I know my family mechanic who has seen my car before and after this experience agrees with me, especially considering that it was not leaking oil before the accident. Caliber tried to tell me that it's "normal" for my car to be leaking because it's about 90k miles, even though it's a 2015 Scion FR-S. The seals are nowhere near old enough to be failing yet. The only reason they should be failing is misuse of the engine, which running it without radiator fluid repeatedly constitutes.

As a side note they also took my car for a joyride, without coolant of course. The reasons I believe this are the ladies sunglasses in my glovebox, and the extra miles on the car. I don't keep sunglasses in there, and the glasses didn't belong to my girlfriend as she wears prescription lenses. Seems pretty suspicious considering my car was only there for repairs. I understand a test drive, but the glasses and miles tell a more exciting story. You still shouldn't do a test drive without any radiator fluid though, especially with the Ferris Bueller-esque shenanigans they likely pulled. I am extremely displeased and I will not stand for this.</Review>

I asked him if I went to another body shop and asked them to paint half of the door would they tell me I had to paint the whole door because they can't just paint half or would they say Yeah sure no problem didn't give me an answer ask him for a quote to fix the other half and gave me a quote for 625 dollars to  remove 3 small and I mean small chips repaint the door properly they  basicly half ass painted in the first place apparently it takes 6 extra hours of body work to bondo some chips on a door to a small Honda door that they had just done work too now your down to half of a door to work with add another extra 6 to paint  and that's not even the final estimate sheesh i just spent 3000 1000 of my own pocket for a door and  and small qt panel to be fixed only to be told that I have to pay an extra 625 for some rookie mistakesi could have gotten the work done somewhere else and got the whole car painted for that amount not to mention they didn't mask off my mudguard so now thats painted silver the rear lip is partially painted silver even tho it's supposed to be  black I have them the time to do it right i thought they were the best but sadly they don't live up to the name maybe next time I'll try a different one because the walnut one seems to have a lower standard< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c32bbd76bbadd7:0xc7ded16fb10ab804<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

To get an 3 star (averege rating), a collision repair shop should at least be able to return a vehicle that had less than $2k worth of damage back to the condition it was in prior to the accident. Not too unreasonable - right? That didn't happen for me and the service advisor that was assigned to me had more excuses as to why it wasn't repaired correctly than he did a desire to get it done right. We had been here before but I don't think I can recommend their services again. To get a 4 or 5 star, the primary contact should have a desire to superceded expectations - not do just what it takes to just get that insurance money. At least that is the impression i got.  There's more that I can write but it is sufficient to say that I would look for a different place before going back there. Such a simple job and I am not happy. I can't imagine giving them anything where there was a lot of damage. Who knows what other excuses they will offer.< /Review>

<Text>Horrible service!!! My car was there for 1 month to be repainted on certain areas and when I picked it up it had a big dent where it was painted supposively the painter didn't see it but it was so big you could see it from all angles,this dent was  on the door. And the car  was  supposively on "QUALITY CONTROL" for 1 week lol,my bumper wasn't place back together how it should soppuse to be, scratches on the paint and now that I washed it it has some excessive clear coat on my door!! Oh and also my car had a dent on my trunk and I  told the manager to fix it and he refused to do it, he said  no because it was a rock ship and said that my car had 12k miles already in other words he kind said my car wasn't new anymore  and that basically it was my fault for having those miles  , are you serious😤😤!!! I would never never again take any of my cars back to that shop. What's  the point of having life warranty if I have to take my car every week for them to fix a different issue. So if your that type of person who really cares about your car and paint AVOID this shop!

(Translated by Google) Don't come to his home to fix the car!
I'm coming for repair my rear bumper, after all didn't match at all! guys! Check this out!!!
At first they said changed a new bumper, but then they said didn't change, just fix the scratch! And one more thing!
They made a NAIL in my rear passenger side tire!!!
I have to come back again to fix it!!!
And most Ridiculous thing is after I leave this car for a whole day they didn't fix for nothing!

I drove the car to repair the bumper, spent $759, and then lied to me to change my new bumper. After I came back, I found that there was no alignment at all! ! And when I go back again and ask them to repair it for me, they tell me that they didn't change the bumper, just sprayed it on me! So still the original bumper! I rub! There is such a thing! ? When I left, I found out that my car had a nail on my right rear wheel during the repair process! ! After a few days, I went back to find them to repair, and I didn’t recognize the account at the beginning. Then I asked for repairs, and then I placed them one day! When I get the car back,
Development of the fuck is not repaired at all! The nail is still there! Everyone looks at the pictures! His service attitude is particularly important! And the quality of service is more special! Don't come over! You will regret it! I will regret it! I will regret it! The important thing is to say three times! Your sister-in-law (-`Д ́-ノ;)ノ! !

我开这辆车来维修保险杠，花了$759，然后骗我说给我换了新的保险杠，回来以后我才发现根本就没有对齐！！而且等我再一次回去要让他们给我修理的时候，他们告诉我说这个保险杠他们没有换新的，就是给我喷了喷油漆！所以还是原来的保险杠！我擦！有这样的！？等我离开以后发现我的车在他们维修的过程还特么的扎了个钉子在我的右后轮子上面！！过了几天我回去找他们修，一开始死活不认账，后来说给我修理，然后我放在哪里一天！等我拿到车回来以后
发展他妈的根本就没修！钉子还在！大家看图片！他家的服务态度特别扯！而且服务质量更特么扯淡！千万别过来！你一定会后悔死！一定会后悔死！一定会后悔死！重要的事情说特么三遍！你妹Σ(-`Д´-ﾉ；)ﾉ！！</text>

Got quotes from other places (including SafeliteAutoGlass) and they were 3x more expensive...got a brand new windshield for under $150. Just be willing to wait for about 1 hour, and make sure to bring cash!

Have been here in the past and have gotten OEM windows put in, it all depends on availability..will definitely recommend to my friends.</Review><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

<review>This place was amazing!  Had to get the front windshield replaced after a rock cracked it...bummer!  Another company was going to charge almost $900.00 for the replacement, but these folks replaced the glass in under an hour for a total of $140.00.  While I hope not to have to replace the windshield again, I would DEFINITELY take it here if needed.  Fast, super friendly and great service!!!</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I was really in and out of that place with the quickness. Make sure that when you go that you do call in advanced and get a price. Also they only do cash, so if you dob't have cash there's a liqour store across the street that has an atm. Really nice, hard working guys. They really took care of me. I'm so happy I didn't have to spend almost 400 with Safelight just to get my windshield done. So thank you guys sooo much.</Review>

Great work and cheap price. Bring cash. Once you get over them hacking your old windshield off with a Sawzall scrapper blade and spray bottle,  it doesnt feel so bad.</Review>

This shop has excellent customer service! Amar was our contact person and he quoted us a fair price and set up an appt. As other reviewers have stated, we found him to be very nice. The shop staff were great as well! They went above and beyond in their service. We would definitely use them again, but we hope we never have to.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Second time here and it had been a while between visits. The meat looks thick and marbled through out as it did the first time I was there. All the meat in the market is organic. I was surprised to see they had organic vegetables which was a nice surprise. They offer bacon that you can choose from that is thick or thin. There are seasoned chicken thighs or seasoned whole chicken to choose from.<//Text>

<Review>Delicious meat. Got a prime rib from them for Christmas dinner last year and it was the best beef I've ever had. Great deals on their summer pack with hamburgers, hot dogs, and chicken too! Super friendly staff always happy to help.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

{'time': 1609975337945, 'text': "Hello Eddi,  I appreciate and understand your concern. We take mask wearing and all Covid safety protocols very seriously. I believe that lady your were concerned with was fixing a computer issue (several  behind a glass counter, not related to the deli.) She did not tell you, but her glasses fogged up while explaining a technical glitch on the store's website to the technician. I'm sorry for this experience, and again, we do take mask wearing seriously. Thank you."}<//Response>
<Review>I went to Main Street Meats for the first time to order a prime rib for Christmas.  At the time I thought the place was pretty cute, and the deli menu looked good. I came back to order a sandwich today.  The woman who worked behind the counter was talking loudly to an employee--and she was not wearing a mask.  This is the height of the pandemic, and masks are required by the city/county in all businesses.  I asked her nicely why she didn't have her mask on.  She yelled at me, "BECAUSE I AM TALKING!"--Wow. Rude.  Then she called for another employee to help me.  I was not interested in ordering from the deli after her rudeness and lack of attention to County Health requirements.  I won't be back.<//Review><time>1610143739466<//time><pics>None<//pics><userid>114841592808240677726< /userid></record>

Main Street Meats not ONLY has the BEST well meat in town - but the staff is knowledgeable and wickedly helpful.  Cut up a whole chicken, SURE,  Give you a crash course in how to cook a Prime Rib roast,  OK no time for Prime Rib - so a New York Roast - FREE seasoning.  CUSTOMER SERVICE EXTRAORDINAIRE.  And for you Porterhouse steak fans - This IS the only place to by a beautifully aged one.  On a budget - no worries - their signature 'sirloin hamburger mix' will please ANYONE who eats beef - small patties between butter lettuce with a slice of ripe tomato always garners rave reviews from my friends.  Bottom Line.  You can not go wrong buying your meat here !

OH yeah they usually have nice russet potatoes, an assortment of deli meats and even dessert - can you say "one stop shopping'!

I have absolutely no affiliation with this establishment, other than loyal customer.</Text>

Excellent selection of meats and sides to prepare at home or made to order sandwiches.  The meats are prime quality and can get expensive - so choose wisely for your budget.  I’ve enjoyed the t-bones and ribeyes, but come away much lighter in the wallet.<//text>

< Review>
Gave this place multiple tries at a cost of hundreds & hundreds of dollars. Pork is decent, ground beef is decent but the steaks are tough as leather. Tried all steaks from porter house to ribeye and they just don't stand up to other organic farmed meat in the Venture area. If I am paying 40 plus dollars for a couple steaks, I want to be able to chew them!.<//Review>

Sharon never once smiled while helping us, then gave us a fork instead of a spoon, part of the lettuce was wilted. Looked as if she was overworked and then her help just left her...There were 2 customers waiting for about 15 minutes to be helped while she finished with us.  Not crazy about the service that day although I have been here before and always had a friendly face.</text>

We wanted a few Chickie's for eggs and we got these beautiful little guys, oh and one we call lunch for the meat. They're so cute and sweet ❤️. The workers where so sweet and helped answer so many questions.< /text>

Great place George is always so friendly and so his staff. My kids love going there to look at all the animals he has and they always have the best time there. Highly recommend this feed store they also sell 75 pound bags of food instead of 50 and the prices are great<//Review>

I've been going to George's for 6 years now & I m very happy with the  selection and service,  everyone is always helpful,  the prices are very good,  if you're buying feed for any kind of animal they load it right into your vehicle!!   One more thing which I love, no credit cards,  cash is king
My kind of place</Text>

Hi, I'm a new chicken owner and I got 3 Black Australorp chicks on May 10th. Unfortunately I ended up with 3 Barred Rocks.(I'm not going to return them as I already fell in love with them.) I just want you to know that you have to make sure what you are getting from them. Also why I still give them a 4 star review is the chicks are healthy and growing really well. Plus, a side note: Bring cash. They don't take credit card. I don't think you would mind it, because their price is pretty fair.</Text>

<Text>We got out 20 chicks from here in April. So far 5 have died from Mareks. When we called the store for advice/help, the man that answered was very short and not helpful at all. We had one of the chicks tested at UC davis and they confirmed it was Mareks. Unfortunately we've been told theres nothing you can do about this disease so at this point we're just waiting to see if we'll have any survivors.<//Text><name>Samantha Troup<//name>< GmapID>

I go to George's Pet Supply store to purchase 'Taste Of The Wild' dog food. I always find George and his staff to be very friendly and helpful.  The only problem I have is I can never remember the store hours or whether or not he's open on Sundays.  I think he should include the store hours on this website.< /review>

I called this place about the availability of a product. They had it but neglected to mention that they take cash only. I drove to their store only to see the hand painted sign about that. I purchased nothing and went home. I will not be back. ..< /Review>

When some one calls and asks about pricing you would think the store would mention it’s CASH ONLY. No debit, credit or ATM is accepted at this location. Thought I’d share since they didn’t tell me and then pointed some direction telling me the closest ATM is over there (very specific thanks). Definitely would not recommend this store that can’t pay the $.50 per transaction for cards to make it easy on the clients.</review>

It was a pleasure doing business. Will defentaly  be back when I'm in the area. I didn't know they only take cash and was short.  The guy said it was my day so took what I had. I really appreciated him doing that. Because of this I'm for Sure coming back.</review>

All the locals go to George and like me have for years.  George doesn't give an RA about any reviews.  He knows we'll keep coming back because he is a small business, is fair, and does business the way he wants and not based on any reviews.<//review>

Stupid business plan and if you are going to do that, then state it in your sale ad.

(Translated by Google) Many of the employees speak Spanish and it helps a lot. In addition to being fast loading what you need!

I spoke with Beth who was very sweet, professional & prompt about scheduling an appointment and working with my busy schedule. She was able to get the following week. Well today I had the pleasure of having my teeth cleaned by Julie. Iv been a rda in the field for many years and it was really nice to have my teeth cleaned with someone who was light handed, gentle & quick. My teeth feel fantastic & got a good report with Dr. Grossman. I enjoy being a patient at this office & thank everyone for being so awesome! Looking forward to my next visit in October.</review>< Rating>

<Review>Love this dental office!  Very professional, very timely and very friendly.  Really make you feel welcome.  Most of all great quality of dentistry and value for money.

I first went to this dentist because I wasn’t sure where to go.  We had just moved and I had a broken filling.   Was concerned I would ruin the tooth.  I just wanted to get it fixed.  Dr Korando was fantastic in fixing the tooth and another that also broke (old fillings).  Very happy with the results and will declare Dr Korando my dentist.

I really recommend Dr Korando and Twain Harte Dental.<//Review>< rate>

I was very happy with the care and service I received at Twain Harte Dental. All Covid 19 precautions were in place. Everyone was friendly and efficient. They valued my time; getting me in and out according to my appointment schedule. I highly recommend Twain Harte Dental.< /Text>

this is by far the worst dentist we have ever been to, plenty of other moms say the same, yet you would never know by the rating. Prices are very high and the service is below that of other dentist in the area. Ask around and you will see better choices out there<//Text>

One of the best I have even been to. They take any concern seriously and if it is really bad they will do their best to fit you in. When I come here it’s not the stereotypical dentist when you come in they do not talk down to you because of your teeth health. They tell you the problem and immediately what they are going to do about it. Honestly if I lived 3 hours away I would still come here.<//review>

<text>The most unpleasant part of my office visit, surprisingly is not the actual Dental work, but the front staff! The main girl has ALWAYS been so unfriendly, un-inviting and curt. I only go there to support my friend, Dr Grossman. 5 stars for him, 1 Star for the office staff!</text></record></dataset><record>

Was recommended this dentist for their quality of work. Went in as a new patient and they found a crown that needed to be replaced and a cavity that needed to be filled. Quoted $64.xx for filling and $650+ for crown as an in-network dentist. Make appointment for filling 2 weeks later. Go in for filling and am happily surprised how fast they get it done. Go to pay and my bill is now $110. No plain English explaination other than your insurance faxed us one thing the day of quote but when we went in it was different so they lowered your coverage. Dentist knew bill was going to be more well before appointment as confirmed by clerk but made no attempt to inform me of new cost until I was paying. When asked why they didn't call they gave a weak "apology " and said I could call my insurance to find out why it was lowered. They also said my crown quote was accurate still. Called insurance and found out they NEVER submitted a preapproval form for either procedure. If they had, they would have known that white fillings weren't covered. Not sure how they can say the bigger quote is accurate if they havent submitted a preapproval form with insurance to see what they cover. Happy with work done so far but beyond disappointed with customer service. Will not be going back.<//text>

My first visit to Twain Harte Family Dental set me at ease right away.  Everyone from the office to the Dr, were welcoming and professional.  I was impressed that at every stage of my visit,  I was informed of what would happen and given every opportunity to ask questions at any time.  This is an impressive team of professionals and I look forward to many years of having them as my dental group.<//Text>

Incredibly caring, friendly, and knowledgeable staff. Clean and modern facility. TVs on the ceiling so you can watch something while you're in the chair. Windows looking out onto the golf course across the street (beautiful). They called me the day before my appointment to let me know about road work in the area. Best dentistry experience I've ever had, honestly.< /text>

Came up to the mountains on vacation and had a very bad toothache after biting down awkwardly at dinner . I made an appointment the same day and they were able to fit me in and do x-rays and verified there was no major damage. Staff and Dr. were all very nice and professional.   Highly recommended this office!</review>

Everyone was extremely professional, friendly and caring. The facility is so beautiful inside. The dentist was very thorough, took time with me and had a sense of humour. The location was easy to get to and there was plenty of parking. They were very good with my husband and mother as well. My husband and I have been going to them for 2 years now and my mom has been going to then for much longer. Happy to have them as our dentist!!</review>

Just returned home from Twain Harte Family Dental office. Their Name says it all. They don't care how many tweaks it takes, they care and get it right. I am so glad they are gentle and caring.
I used to be afraid and upset when going to a Dentist. From the office staff, Dental Hygienists, to the Dentists themselves, you can't ask for a better Dental experience when going to the Twain Harte Family Dental office.From the moment you walk in to the office, you do not feel the stress of "Going to the Dentist". They put you ad ease with their bright caring smiles. They work with your schedule and everything flows smoothly. I feel blessed to have a caring, community minded office near me.< /review>

I don't like changing doctors but this change has been very pleasant.  The office staff is very friendly, efficient and very accommodating to my schedule.  The staff has managed to work out the usual kinks  offices have and created a smooth running operation.The equipment is state-of-the-art and my dentist is very compassionate, efficient, knowledgeable and friendly. My experience couldn't have been better except the weather was too hot to drive over to the Twain Harte Pharmacy, a favorite shopping venue.< /text>

Went in for a dental cleaning today. Lisa did a great job as always. Quick check by the Dentist and all was confirmed to be good for another 100,000 miles.  Front office staff were great as always!  I always get greeted with a great smile 😊 and a joyful hello.
Awesome staff all the way around !!!<//Review>

Love this dental clinic. Got a good deep cleaning today and they didn't nag me about not flossing enough. 😁</review>

We've had Dr. McKelvey as our family dentist for the last 25 years. With his recent retirement, we switched to Dr. Le, who is new to the practice. My wife and I are both very happy with Dr. Le. He is very thorough and professional, and is very competent in every way. Dr. Le is the kind of dentist who will fill up his patient roster quickly, so if you're looking for a dentist I would suggest getting started with him ASAP.</text>

The Dentist was very good and so was his assistant, and after a strange blue glow and a little epoxy I was out in 90 min and having a comfortable cocktail at the bar. Thank you!</Review>< username>

The staff was extremely nice, efficient and helpful with adding me as a patient to their practice. They made me feel very welcome and comfortable right when I walked in the door. After filling out the proper paperwork, they quickly got me back to see my dentist and he answered every question I had and gave me alternatives to every answer I wasn't sure with. I highly recommend Twain Harte Family Dental Care</text>

This dental office made me welcome, and well taken care of. That's hard to do since I am usually very skittish with dental care. They took excellent care of me & expertly handled every detail, from the x-rays ( digital!) to the  treatment plan, to the cleaning & most importantly the follow up with my insurance. What an awesome experience. Thank You.</Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I’ll start off by saying I am the biggest wimp when it comes to the dentist. I have extremely sensitive teeth and gums and after some previous, more traumatic, dentist visits going to the dentist generally causes me severe anxiety.

Twaine Harte Family Dental is by far the nicest dentist office I’ve ever visited. Everyone is so kind and accommodating and willing to work with me to get my procedures done despite my extreme sensitivity and anxiety. They explain what they’re doing and what tools they’ll be using and give me time to take a breath or two and recompose myself if the procedure gets to be too much. They’re also super quick and easy to get ahold of. I sent in a request for appointment online and got a response within a day or so. They communicate very well, the text reminders for my appointments are a huge lifesaver! They’ll also communicate via text if for whatever reason you’re unable to call

I absolutely recommend this office, they maintain a professional yet friendly and welcoming environment and are by far the best dental practitioners I’ve ever visited.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x8090cc0a13b96435:0x7eec69c3247af6f2</Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
My family and I drove from Livermore to Long Barn Lodge for the holiday weekend yesterday. I've never had a dental emergency before but the mix of the elevation and my wisdom tooth I had a terrible pain in my mouth. I thought I was going to have to live with it because it was a holiday and no one was open. But my dad called Twain Heart Family Dental and the owner told me to come right in free of charge so my holiday wasn't ruined! Every one was so nice and helpful I've never been to a dentist so caring and genuinely concerned about me. I left happy with free floss!</Review>

Very pleased with Twain Harte Dental.

Hygienists are very nice - and gentle !

Dr. McKelvey is excellent.  Very good communication, attentive and does nice work.

Welcoming staff and office is very comfortable.  And hey, some of the treatment areas even have a view of the golf course...<//text>

I have been a long time patient of Dr. McKelvey, DDS and have had excellent experience with the entire practice.  Lisa is the hygienist that cleans my teeth and has done so for several years.  I could not be more pleased with all of the staff, including the front-office people who schedule appointments, handle insurance matters and greet me when I arrive.  I do recommend the practice without any reservations.<//Review>

I broke a tooth and they were kind a courteous and did a free consultation. They got me in the next day.  I am pregnant and they did not want to push any procedures on me until they consulted with my doctor first.

Wait time was minimal and great patient care.</review>

All of the staff here are friendly and professional. I've never had to wait past my appointment time and it's usually at the end of the day. They always accommodate my schedule and are readily available for dental emergencies, which I had have had experience with. I would highly recommend them for the whole family.</Text>

<Review>With over 30 years of seeking dental services in the western states and Canada, Dr Korando is truly the best dentist i have ever found.  Friendly staff  and modern facilities are also as good or better than any you will find anywhere. I definitely recommend Twain Harte Family Dental Care to anyone and is well worth the drive to Twain Harte.<//Review>< pictures>

It was just okay. The dentist who looked at my teeth asked too many personal questions unrelated to my teeth. It took 3 hours for a 1 hour procedure. The dental assistant who cleaned my teeth did a nice job though.<//Text>

<text>Dr Grossman did a great job on my recent crown. I trust all the Doctors and would see anyone of them. The staff is well trained and work like clock work.  I appreciate that the assistants are licensed and excellent at making my visit a pleasent experience. The staff at the front office is warm and friendly. They go the extra mile with customer service.  After working in the dental profession for 30 years with many different dentists, This is where I would go to get my dental work done.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Every time I visit this dental office I feel so welcomed and comfortable. The office staff is very friendly, professional and knowledgeable. The atmosphere of the office and operatories is very warm and comfortable and they have the latest equipment. They typically run ontime and the dentists and dental hygienist do not rush through your treatment. They are very thorough. I would highly recommend this dental office.< /review>

< review>
I had a crown come loose today , twain harte family dental was able to get me in right away. Not only did Dr Korondo diagnosis the problem but he also did the work that needed to be done. He explained all treatment options to me and I trusted him with everything he said. Dr Korondo thank you so much!! This was super helpful being that I was going to be at work for the next 48 hours. Rachel was so helpful in coming in to talk  to me about my finances with the treatment I had done. My assistant Deidra, she was very helpful in explaining to me what we were going to do next, and made small talk with me making the whole experience very comfortable. The staff at THFD is like nothing else, and I’m so thankful for all their help today!</review>

I have been a patient at this practice since 2009. I was a mess when I arrived. Had a fear of the dentist since childhood and a lot of work to get done starting with Wisdom teeth and all the problems they created by avoiding the dentist.
Dr. Grossman and everyone I have interacted with at this practice are of the highest possible calibre. The rest of the medial industry could take a few notes from this team of people. The facility has always been extremely clean from the waiting room to the exam room. Paint is well cared for, even the vents on their ventilation system are kept dust free.  The building is right across from a golf course, so the view from the exam rooms is better than most places.They use all the modern tools, and are attentive to details that keep your overall experience pain free should you need work done. (Obviously they are not miracle workers, some times you have a problem that is just going to hurt after the novocain wears off.)  They are also quite understanding of a tooth ache and the misery it entails, and prior to establishing good dental health they have gotten me in right away to fix an immediate problem. The hygienist's make the cleaning process completely pain free (at least it has been after I got all my initial troubles dealt with) and in the entire time i've been going I never felt I was being judged. Even the billing department is nice,  and very well organized. They use text messages and automated phone call reminders to keep your appointments fresh in mind even for cleanings. I've recommended all my family and friends to this practice, and from what they tell me all the other dentists at this practice are just as good as Dr. Grossman, and all of them have commented on how good their experience was. I have seen most of the faces there for the entire time I have been going to this practice, and have had the same hygienist (Lisa) the entire time. So no turn over in almost 8 years as near as I can tell. I highly recommend anyone who needs to find a good dental practice, go here!<//text>

< Review>
I have hard a hard time going to the dentist my entire life. A couple of years ago I was faced with some really tuff dental choices, and tried a new dentist who failed me terribly. I was referred to Dr. Grossman by Margaret G. who thought he might be someone I could trust and be more at ease with. Was she ever right!! My journey isn't quite over, but if not for Dr. Grossman and the amazing and understanding staff at THFD, I don't where Id be in this journey. Probably in pain and afraid to go forward with it. THANK YOU!!<//Review>

<Text>I have been going to Dr. Mckelvey's office for over 20 years.  He is the best Denist I have ever had.   I actually lived in Virginia for a short time And went to the denist in  Christiansburg Virginia.  He was complementing me on how great my teeth looked and said my dentist was the best he'd ever seen.  He told me it was like an art.
The receptionists in the office are wonderful they're always there and willing to help you with anything they can.  I have known Margaret since I have been going to Dr. Mckelvey's office she's wonderful and always willing to help. And it doesn't matter where she sees you she will stop and say hello.<//Text>< pictures>

Unfortunately, I did not get his name but he picked up my Camaro and took it to the collision center, we had some obstacles with the towing yard, not his company but the original towing company that took the car during the accident And once again, he was very understandable and waited until the car was released to him. Outstanding service!!!!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Manny came to my home in Lake Arrowhead with my disabled vehicle in the driveway. Within 15 mins the my car was loaded onto the flatbed truck. When AAA gave me the link for Manny’s ETA, he came faster than what I thought. I arrived at the dealership in Ontario at exactly the time I estimated. Manny provided excellent service and he is a model for which other roadside technicians should strive to be. Roy and Dot’s Towing has a wonderful person in their midst! Manny has a huge heart! Thank you so very much!!<//text>

Great service, friendly and quick response time. We needed to get towed and Angel attended to our call on and took care of everything for us. Angel was highly professional and very friendly. I would highly recommended this towing company to take care of your car needs. If we ever need to call a tow truck we’ll be sure to contact Roy & Dot’s Towing.</text>

The driver was very professional and extremely kind....I NEVER do reviews but when you meet individuals that truly deserve to be recognized you do that...I honestly don't remember his name but I will never forget his kindness...Thanks Roy & Dots Towing for hiring top of line employees...< /review>

<Text>Honestly what a great tow truck driver. Was stuck up in Crestline and the local company just wouldn't show up for whatever reason. This guy showed up and was very polite and took care of everything, only complaint which I'm not too sure who's to blame was that when AAA called me to tell me that they found this company that they were 2 to 3 hrs out and would call me to let me know when they'd be there, instead I got a text message saying they were 30 Mins away! Lol so I left work and headed to the house to make sure someone would be there to relieve the truck. It took about an hr from the time I got called by AAA to having a tow! Unbelievably great really but I do feel the company should call to confirm. Other than that it was a super streamlined and excellent experience so I'm giving this company 5 stars!🌟🤩✨<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Thank you Roy and Dots towing. Your driver was courteous and professional. He picked up my truck and took it to  to the AAA approved tire shop when I got a flat tire on the freeway. The tire shop couldn’t accommodate my tires, so the driver went back and picked up my truck and took it to another shop That was capable of Replacing a 26 inch tire. I was not at the first location when he arrived to pick up my truck. He called me to verify that that’s what I wanted. I was very grateful for the extra effort on his part of making that extra phone call to verify the change.I definitely would recommend Roy and Dots towing to anybody that needs a tow.< /text>

I flipped on the freeway and bob amazingly flipped it back upright and out of the freeway in less than one hour! He called dispatch to see if I can get this for free and use AAA for the tow back home and thankfully was successful, thank you Roy and Dots so much< /review>

Bob was my savior!! Other companies wouldn’t help out because of curfew even though that’s their job so the curfew won’t apply! From being frustrated Bob made it end a great way he got there very fast! Super friendly, knowledgeable, taught me a few things, very professional and courteous! For any future services I will be back! Thank you BOB!</text>

I have dealt with many tow companies in my time. By far, Roy and Dots Towing is the best. Bob was awesome and the most professional driver I have ever dealt with in the towing industry. He took care of my car like it was his own. Something you dont see from other tow companies. When I need a tow from now on, I will request Ray and Dot's Towing. GREAT JOB<//Text>

Vicent was well-mannered,  dressed professional,  and  made me feel comfortable about towing my 2007 Audi. He also assured me that he would make sure my tow bar was placed back and windows closed. Furthermore,  he called to let me know the car was dropped off at my mechanic in Orange. Thank you again Vincent and Roy & Dot"s . I know it wasnt a fun tow due to the distance,; nonetheless,  AAA has great connections with amazing company's.  Amen!!! Sincerely, HLD<//Review>

Awesome experience today with Roy & Dots Towing.  Came for a tow via Geico. Very knowledgeable and friendly in person and on phone.  Tried to crank car, said battery and then threw on a battery pack and car cranked right up!  Diagnosed it perfect.

Great service and accurate diagnosis.  Even a couple minutes early on arrival!  Thanks, Roy & Dot's Towing!!!<//text>

Very careful and caring--he even drove me towards the nearest exit to guide me to where I needed to go, so that was really appreciated! Definitely would recommend if you need fast help with customer service.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Name>Christine Garavito</Name>< Rate>

Roy & Dot’s was sent to me by AAA with an estimated arrival of 1 hour. The driver Brian was there in 15 minutes! He took great care loading my truck onto the tow bed and gave me a lift to the mechanic. Brian provided excellent service and helped me get on with my day.< /text>

This is a very good tow company. I didn't get the driver's name, but he. was very professional and polite. They kept in touch with me to let me know when they would arrive. I would hire them even if I wasn't covered by my insurance company.. I give them five stars on every thing.</review>

I called different tow agencies for estimates and wait time. Roy and Dots Towing was amazing from the time I called until the time they got me out of the mud. Angel was the driver whom came to “rescue” me. I was having a terrible morning and I was not in a very good mood, but Angel was sweet helpful and had a great sense of humor. He really turned an unfortunate situation into a great customer service experience. I will NEVER forget how he went above and beyond for me and my sanity. Lol. This guy Angel was in the mud in the water in the cold shoveling mud and still kept a smile on his face the whole time. I truly appreciate great customer service and Angel did just that. Thank you Roy and Dots Towing for hiring someone whom represents your company in such a wonderful way. I will definitely recommend you guys and thank you for turning a terrible start of my day into a great experience. Angel don’t ever change your wonderful customer service skills. Roy and Dots Towing 👍🏼Keep up the great work.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

The guy OMG was so unprofessional he’s was trying to flirt with me the entire time so much he forgot to tie one of the hooks when we took off. Almost damaged my car. Than he said o it’s because your your emergency brake wasn’t on and tried to blame it on me. Hope I never get a tow from this company and after on the ride he was like can you get on the internet and give me a good review they give bonuses for me. Like seriously after that hell no
Think he’s name was Vincent or victor has tattoos I was so uncomfortable in the truck😒<//review>

Bob , the driver assigned to pick up our car was very professional, came on time and followed up with me by phone about status of my wife’s car (a newer model Mercedes Benz C300) he delivered to our mechanic at Walnut Hills Auto Repair. He knows his responsibilities and sticks by the AAA strict standard. Bob is knowledgeable and dependable. I highly recommend Bob and the company he represents. Good job Bob!👍👍👍...

Roy & Dot's Towing were very prompt. I was told they would be at my home in an hour and the driver, Miguel, was there half-hour before. Miguel was very pleasant and courteous! My only fault was with myself in that I did not have any cash on me to tip him when he delivered my vehicle to the dealer. Kudos to Miguel and Roy & Dot's!<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Miguel was awesome. I have a 2006 Bmw 750 Li and two other tow trucks came prior and because my car didnt go into neutral, they couldnt help me.  Because of this issue, i had to leave my car overnight and deal with it in the morning. Miguel came with perfect knowledge of my car, used my key to unlock the gears down by the break and also showed me that i have a tow hitch in my trunk. Amazing!!.

<text>After waiting hours for another tow company my insurance company contacted Roy and Dots Towing . They arrived quickly and driver was courteous and professional.  I didn't have to do anything as he handled it all, even when dropping vehicle off at repair. Thank you Roy and Dots.< /text>< Pictures>

I needed my truck towed to a repair shop. Whitin minutes of calling, I received a text saying a driver was on the way, and a few minutes after that, Angel was at my apartment gate! Extremely fast service, and Angel is kind, friendly and professional. I will use this tow service again!</Text>

<review>Thieves Thieves Thieves. when I called to report almost 15k worth of goods stolen they never responded. Then I went in to make a in-person report I waited 2 hours for some fat smelly woman to come talk to me and she said "our cameras don't work" and when i asked to talk to the owner she told me "he's helping poor people." Since my iPhone was stolen i went to find my iPhone and guess where the last spot was it was on. Right here at roy and dots. Then I met one of there drivers who sold me some drugs. He was cool and told me the fat woman is always the one stealing but since she's the supervisor she gets away with it.</review>< Pics>

<review>They arrived sooner than I was told, towing service contacted me within minutes of AAA contacted them. Then I was greeted and helped by Bob who fixed my car and was incredibly nice in a day when everything seemed to be going wrong. Thank you for the help, the speed in which you handled it and the encouragement (which is not typically included) :)</review>< rating>

Today at 10:15am on the corner of Maple and Etiwanda in Fontana i received a tow truck driver by the name of Angel that assisted me with a tow to the tire shop. He was a nice, pleasant, and courteous driver. I would recommend him to all of my AAA patriants!!< /Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Used to work for dave it was the biggest mistake I've made he thinks because he is having money problems he doesn't have to pay his employees or fix the crappie trucks he has still owes me, ex and current employees money and instead of making payroll he will faithfully buy Dodger tickets and hit the bar down the street after work. I'm surprised he hasn't ended up in jail for all the shady things he does...... I suggest everyone take their money elsewhere. It's just a matter of time before aaa finds out everything about this clown they will cut him off like Rialto PD and other agencies did ... Pass this info on<//text>< Pictures>

Home Goods at one, Marshalls at the other, and a choice of waffles or ramen to keep up your value shopping energy in between.

Parking is free and ample.<//review>

I joined the YMCA for some lap swimming,
It was the best decision I ever made! The pool is gorgeous welcoming and being in it is just fabulous! Everybody at the Y is helpful and nice. They gave me water weights and wakeboards and they have inner tubes anything you want it doesn't have to be lap swimming but you getting that pull and it's just wonderful< /text>

We come hear for the YMCA Anaheim swim classes. I didn't even know this pool existed until I found the swim classes. The staff is friendly. The lockers and pool are clean. There's plenty of shade for the parents to sit and watch the classes. I also love that the pool is only 2.5' where they instruct the littles so my 4 yo can actually reach the bottom and still be above water no problem. That really helps with their confidence in the water. My 4yo really likes Ms. Amanda and the other instructors. We signed up for the second session.< /text>

This pool is very well supervised by friendly lifeguards, polite and helpful staff- lifeguards test potential swimmers before allowing in the deep end on weekend open family swims. It was a very enjoyable place to visit.</text>

(Translated by Google) I liked it so much because they are very well organized there is a lot of security it is free on Fridays from 12:00 to 2:20 and on Saturdays from 1:00 to 5:00 the swimming lessons are 52 per person 8 days with sections in the morning and Afternoon I really liked it it has from low parts for children from 5 years old to adults. Very good recommended pool ....

(Translated by Google) It's nice but there are a lot of people who like to live on the street, I don't know what to call them

The vets and staff seem to be doing their utmost to attend to the pets. Banfield is always busy. Suggest you make an appointment before you come.

This clinic shares the place with PetSmart, very convenient for pet parents.<//Review>

< Review>
My family has been using Banfield for all of our pets for the past 15+ years and I started bringing my own puppy recently, however I can't be loyal if the service is continuously subpar.

It has now happened three times where I arrive to the appointment and call for a check-in, however no one responds. The first two times, someone finally picked up after 15 or so minutes and they were able to take my dog. Frustrating but passable. This last time I sat for 30 minutes calling to check-in and when they finally picked up, they let me know that I had missed my dog's appointment. They acknowledged that they couldn't pick up the phone because there was only one person available to answer and that there were many calls, therefore my call went unanswered.

Instead of fitting my dog in, they asked me to drop her off for a 6pm pickup when her appointment was at 10:30am. So I left my puppy, who had only had breakfast, through 6pm, having her miss two meals. This was the only option they gave me and said they would give her "a treat". No idea whether they did or not.

I think the vets at this location have been knowledgeable but the service isn't worth continuing to be a loyal customer. There are plenty of great vets with better service for customers. Definitely take your pet somewhere that can provide the support and professionalism you're expecting so your time taken off from work is met with the same respect you have given by being on time -- you won't consistently find that here.< /Review>

< Review>
They need to communicate what is being provided during appointments and not wait for the pet parents to ask. They are the “experts” so they should clearly provide this information, especially to the new pet parents. Never saw or spoke to the Veterinarian during my 2 visits. Cancelled our 3rd appointment and going to the other location.</Review>

<rating>1</rating><text>I had an awful experience with this hospital. I recommend you to look carefully about the things they charge you - they charged me differently from what even we agreed with and lied about the service they provided.

In August, I took my dog to this hospital for dental cleaning and teeth extraction surgery. That experience was OK, the doctor told me there were still two more teeth need to be removed, so I just need to make an appointment for teeth extraction next time.

I did it and specifically told the nurse this time no dental cleaning, and she acknowledged. Before the surgery, another doctor gave me the estimate(no details, just the total number), I trusted their expertise and didn’t ask questions about it. Last Friday, when I dropped off my dog for the appointment, the nurse confirmed with me " this will be no dental cleaning and just teeth extraction surgery." When I picked up my dog in the evening, the nursed told me that even though my dog didn’t have dental cleaning this time, she managed to scrub off some residues from the teeth.

I was so confused when I got the bill because they charged me for a dental cleaning. When I called them, they told me the manager will call me, I waited for two days, and they never called. I called again. They started to claim the dental cleaning is required before the surgery which I thought is ridiculous. Do you really need to remove the tartar from the teeth that you eventually going to extract? Nevertheless to mention he just had the dental cleaning two months ago! What’s more important, those staffs have confirmed it with me that there wouldn’t be/wasn’t a dental cleaning.

Eventually, they started to blame me for approving the bill and said there's nothing they can do about it. I honestly feel sorry for those staff who work hard at this hospital - my first experience wasn't bad. However, it's not a trustworthy hospital as a whole.< /text>< pictures>

It's rare I feel truly ripped off and disgusted with humanity.

But these people do not even try to hide thire Lack of concern for your animal.

They know they've got you in a desperate situation. They know they've got you in a desperate situation And are more than happy to pounce on it.

Normally I would go to a privately owned veterinarian.

But due to some Bad choices with insurance banfield was  Where we had to go.

Honestly if your dog is sick take itout and shoot it in the head before bringing it to these con artists.

If I wasn't clear
I will not be returning< /review>

<date>1596572146796<//date><Rate>2</Rate><Review>My family and I have been going to this specific location for YEARS since we adopted our first Maltese, then our first Yorkie, and then our two Morkie babies. We've always had extremely great experiences with every member of the staff here!

However, the last encounter we had (August 1st) was with the nastiest receptionist we've ever encountered. I asked my mother to help me pick up my Yorkie as I was out of town. He needed a physical and we were told he was due for shots (thank you Banfield for letting us know!) but as she picked Toby up, she was not asked to sign ANY FORMS, NOR was she given any of the usual paper work after a visit.

She soon after had to take my grandfather to his dialysis appointment when she received a call from Banfield, from a rude and angry male receptionist stating she had not signed the required forms to discharge Toby?? Mind you, she doesn't speak the best English and she had no idea she had done any wrong doing. She told the male receptionist she can come after she drops off my grandfather to which he became rude and NOT understanding, implying she needed to drop what she was doing to come back to sign these "forms" that she did not even know about.

Banfield, we love you but retrain your staff to have better communication in interactions with customers. How my mother was treated is NOT okay and we are still trying to learn this male receptionist's name.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>I really felt disrespected, angry, spent a lot of money and was treated like this. First of all, I have two cats, a boy a girl, two into the clinic to make vaccine and physical examination, and finally I got my test results prove that the doctor misspelled the genders of the one, the girls as boys. Are you seriously checking my cat? I doubt it because COVID-19 is not something we can wait for and accompany my pet in the clinic. We reaction to the front desk staff to write wrong, attitude is very bad, do not think that I didn't see him their partner to me reluctant to deal with things, I think he did not deal with to help us to communicate with the doctor's. Secondly, my cat needs some documents to fly next month. One of my cats does not need to shoot the cat plague vaccine. Without this vaccine, the doctor is not willing to sign his name. He also said that he was not willing to change the information, because he had spent a lot of time, then I would like to ask what is the use of this piece of waste paper? And we have to pay 30 dollars for a piece of useless white paper. We are guests, not not to pay, spend money to find the pain, in a word, I am not satisfied with the service this time, the quality of personnel need to be improved.</text>< pics>

I was going to this facility for years. At first they were so sweet and caring, but after a while my dog seemed to be extremely scared going in and leaving with her tail between her legs. Last week, my dog had extreme diarrhea and when I took her to the vet, they told me to give her low-fat diet and a probiotic. That was it. I took her to the Banfield in Colma the next day (they had early same day appointments) and they gave her anti diarrhea medication the first day they saw her. They followed up the next day and asked how she was doing.

Banfield hospital is overall a great place to take your fur babies. This specific location isn’t the best. Maybe they’re understaffed and too many pets to look out for.< /Review>

My dog oreo was taken to vet for foxtail removal,I had to drop her off in the morning because they didn't have appointment that day. Dr Rose call me in the afternoon saying that they didn't find anything and that if it was first time of oreo there?,which it wasn't. Somehow staff had created 2 charts with information of my husband and one with my information and they were trying to charge regular price when we had the wellness plan When I went and pick up my dog I was expecting to pick her up outside but the lady that help me ask me to come inside to pay, when It would have been easier to pay by the phone which I end up doing,I ask her to bring my dog out instead and told them to give me the indications by the phone. When I received my dog her paw was cover with a bandage and I wasn't able to see what they had done. The staff was trying to make appointment to bring oreo back in 2 days which I didn't agree doing it. After 2 days I open up the bandages myself and noticed it that they didn't do anything with her paw, her paw was swollen and full of pus and I knew this because in the past she had the same issue and was taken to somewhere else and resultes where different. We had to clean the wound and open up the wound to drain all the pus and Guess what we found " the foxtail" that Dr Rose couldn't find. My husband call the place to talk to the manager about what happened, he was told that manager was busy, he left all his information for a call back and until today we haven't received a call yet. Please please do not ever take your dog to this location. Waste of time, waste of money and very unprofessional people.< /text>

Due the corona virus I agree to have an Appointment (a drop off appt) @9:30am (for 4 years old dog ) for his Comprehensive Exam which is usually not longer than 2 hrs . But this appointment took so long about 6 and half then they called me around 4pm for pick up. I feel like weird and worried and wondering why so late. Then when i came to hospital to pick up my dog I’ve noticed his left eye was so red and have a huge blood clot around the eyes and bruise on the top of his eye. Im really upset that day, mad, and very disappointed asking what happen to my dog? Then this rude staff lady answered: ask the doctor In charged, then i’ve told her i want to talk to the doctor. Sadly the doctor not came out and he just talk to me via phone while im outside of the hospital. He said the swollen eye of my dog is due of stress and trauma. Unbelievable i do understand most of pets get stress and traumatized when they go to the hospital and grooming salon but it happens all  the time but this one is different . When i saw my dog his really scared and hurt so bad, im a dog parent I know his action. Please help me to find out what is going on. As a dog parent I trusted them to take good care of my dog , please treat them like a human they have a feelings too. Hope you can help me in this matter. And please hired people who has a big heart for all pets.< /Text>< Rate>

<text>Dr. Lee at the Banfield location in Daly City saw my 15yr old Shih-Tzu, which was coming in for an appointment regarding his dental disease. After reviewing my dog, she recommended that I put him to SLEEP, meanwhile she was not even a dental surgeon and could not provide me with any information as to if he was in pain or suffering!! She proceeded to tell me that my dog was severely underweight, going senile and could not give a response regarding what was going on in his mouth even after asking her to check if he had a broken tooth several times. However, after consulting with another vet who IS a dental surgeon Dr. Huynh also at Banfield Daly City, he was great and recommended that I go though with the dental surgery. I took my dog to Ocean Ave Veterinarian Hospital in SF and they saved my dog and also told me he has at least another two years of life......Dr. Lee I hope you see this review and I hope that you LEARN compassion and STOP jumping to conclusion OR assumptions. Dr. Lee should really look at changing careers because you don't have what it takes to be a Good vet, you almost killed my dog. Had I not gotten a second and third opinion, I would have put a perfectly healthy family member to sleep!!!<//text><rate>1</rate>< gmap_id>

I have been coming here for over a year and I think the vets and vet techs are wonderful! However the administrative side/front desk is horrific and extremely incompetent. I would never come back but apparently my dog's wellness plan was automatically renewed for another year without my knowledge. I have never dealt with such ignorant and rude people. They kept calling my husband at work, even though we told them multiple times to call me with any questions or concerns. When I go to pick up my dog and pay, there was some confusion with the account, eventhough I told them I was fine paying the full amount. They told me to have a seat to wait for the manager. The benches are about 5 ft from the front desk and I hear one woman say to the other that "there have been multiple calls and I don't want to get involved with that." I didn't even know what was happening. Ultimately it came down to misinformation. After 30 mins of them telling me my plan never included castration they finally actually looked it up and noticed that it had just switched. I still have no idea why no one told me that my care plus plan (or whatever it is called) had expired only 7 days earlier and it automatically updated to a lower plan that didn't cover castration until after he was already neutered.  We had tried calling a month ago to get in sooner and the woman on the phone said they were extremely busy and would call us back but never did.
**Also my dog HATES it there.< /text>

<Review>If this is Oceana Pet. Hospital, I would stay away from them as far as possible. They where telling me one of my cats had cancer and renal failure. Come to find out it was pneumonia and is much better after taking him elsewhere for 2 antibiotics shots. BUYER BEWARE I spent over 2000.00 since February on my other cat and still want more money to run more tests😳I have found a much nicer and not money eater vet that truly cares.</Review></record>

<Text>We just bought a female yorkie.  Vet was very informative and reassuring.  We changed our mind about breeding her as we would rather have her around longer.  Did not know breeding them could subject them to breast cancer.  Was told the dog flu is contained to the East Bay and to hold off until it expands to give the flu shot.  Same thing with ticks...  we didn't get it with our prior dogs so he recommended holding off until we found one.  I am all about prevention but don't like too much medicine or vaccinations unless necessary.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>This place is way too busy! The vets seem stressed out trying to keep up with demand. After setting an appointment you only get a few minutes to talk about issues with your pet.

The vet offered to amputate my dog's leg and was going to charge me $700. I knew there was another option, so I decided to reject that option.

WOW! Called because I was at a different petsmart but I needed my prescription number since I didn't have my prescription card with me to buy my dog's food. It was 15 minutes before the hospital would close but somebody picked up the phone, took my information and put me on hold. After a couple of minutes on hold the call was drop so I called back and noticed that they had put the phone on night mode and my call wouldn't go through. I still had time to call a Banfield hospital in San Mateo where they closed at the same time after this horrible experience. Horrible service</text>

<name>Ellen Wen< /name><Date>1577131712474</Date><rate>5<//rate><text>(Translated by Google) This pet hospital is good. I like it very much. Because all the medical staff at this pet hospital are very caring about pets among any pet owners. The pet doctor also has great love to meet any different pets. The service attitude of other front desk waiters is also very good. Reassuring pet owners, pets are happy to get along with medical staff and receive a diagnosis. Not bad. Awesome

这宠物医院很好，我很喜欢。因为这宠物医院所有的医务人员对任何有宠物的主人中的宠物非常之有爱心。宠物医生也有非常好的爱心去见任何不同的宠物。其它台前服务员服务态度也很好。令宠物主人放心，宠物们也开心和医务人员们和好相处和开心接受的诊断。不错。棒棒哒👍<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

While I have never written a negative review, today’s experience at the Eureka AAA DMV was hands down the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. The staff was rude, inconsiderate and incompetent. Apparently neither were concerned about the line of people waiting (on a time crunch/on a lunch break) as they chatted extensively about irrelevant things rather than actually streamlining and doing their job. One star is still too generous, and only because ultimately they were able to get the job done do I give that.</review>

Everyone at this branch is very friendly! If they can't help you with the service you're looking for then they will direct you where to go (call, online, DMV) and are very gentle about it. This was my first time working with title transfers and insurance and they were very kind and were happy to answer the simple questions I had, which is a huge help on details instead of the confusing DMV website. I was in and out very fast aside from waiting in line, which was the time of day rather than the workers. :)</review>

<review>Very rude snarky. Attitude. Seemed like I was a burden to asked questions. And staff seemed more ingaged  in talking amongst  themselves. Then helping  customers. And trying to get them on the telephone  is beyond ridiculous. Hung up on hold.  Automated  phone system  on endless loop and select option 1234 over and and over then hangs up< /review><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

So much better than the DMV! Able to get an ATV registered today, line was short and staff was friendly and helpful. And social distancing 2as followed, they even wipe down each station after every transaction! Good job folks</Text>

This branch was very conscientious about Covid 19 protocols. Everything was wiped down after each customer, and a supervisor met customers at the door to assist in making sure the customer had what they needed for their transactions before entering. As always,  they were very polite and engaging.</Review>

Some of the employees take there time (not all of them) so it can be a slower to get through the lines , but anything is better than dmv. With AAA membership you have the luxury of handling car registration and insurance at 1 place + you cant beat the towing services with your membership.<//review>

< Review>
My experience, for the first time in decades, was very poor.

The reason we have autoclub memberships is so that we have a pleasant and convenient experience when registering vehicles, inquiring about vacation plans, and of course, the emergency roadside services too. Who wants to stand in line and wait for hours on end at a DMV office?

Well the lady that served me at the counter was terribly ambivalent and indifferent towards me.

First, she said my membership was expired, I opened the app on my phone and showed her it was not, then she said, without ever offering to contact SoCal AAA, that I myself would have to call, and to get out of line and fix the problem.

I called SoCal, they verified that everything was in order, and even waited on the phone to verify with the staff at the local office in northern California where I was at... From the back of the line all over again where I was sent!!!

Fortunately, a gentleman who was handling reception noticed, talked to the rep on my phone, and then had his supervisor apprised of the situation at which point he bumped me up to second in line.

Unfortunately, however, I got the same condescending lady servicing me again and then their computers went down again just before the office closed.

I ended up going to a private registration service center in town where I was in and out in less than 9 minutes. Yes I had to pay a fee but that was gladly paid considering to the more than an hour of the abusive treatment I received at the autoclub office.</Review>

An older woman with glasses who works here is Extremely passive aggressive.
After this experience,
I’ll just go to the DMV from now on.</text>

<text>Locked my keys in my car at Houda Point in Trinidad! Couldn’t find the address to give to the agent but she managed to figure out where I was. The tow truck guy who came out was super friendly and laid back. I forget his name...something that started with a J maybe Justin or Josh? Thanked me for getting to see the beach that day and popped open the lock in less than a minute.< /text></record>

The manager, Justin, is a really great guy. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for most of the females that work in this location. One of the girls who used to call for late payments was incredibly rude and had a very obvious smugness about her. And another lady that you see as you first walk in looks at everyone like an angry dog and barks at them very similarly.<//review>

Not to be mistaken for AA...lol
On a serious note....Lots of free maps for traveling. Easy DMV services at AAA. Roadside services have gotten more limited over the years but if you meet their terms it's well worth it especially if you have an older vehicle.<//Text>

Called for roadside assistance today and was told a tow truck was dispatched and we were a priority call... should be 60 min. 2-hours later, I called for an update and was told no tow was on the way, my tow was not covered. Had they called me to inform me they were not sending a tow truck I would have made my own arrangements immediately... instead, they felt it ok to have me waiting roadside on the highway with a 3-year Old with no help on the way for what turned out to be 5 hours.<//review>

I have an Specialty vehicle. It’s a Mercedes 309D van.

If you have a normal vehicle this probably doesn’t apply to you.

I signed up with AAA specifically for this vehicle and didn’t imagine the headache that came with it.
I don’t imagine I will continue with AAA after this year is over.
My vehicle wouldn’t start and it’s 4 blocks from the mechanic. 5 times in 24 hours they requested the wrong sized tow truck after I passionately expressed that I have a large vehicle that needs special consideration.

I wasn’t able to stay the night with the vehicle so I drove 45 min home over the snowy mountain. I had to drive back here this morning and after hours of phone time with them I’m still sitting here waiting for them. So frustrating that their system doesn’t include or consider my special needs in this matter.

So much wasted time and gasoline and missed days of work and delaying the mechanic work. I can’t imagine what it would have been like if I was far from home. Which is why I chose AAA for the security of having support when I need them on long far out road trips.

I will be researching a company that is RV specific. Wish me luck.</review>

<text>Normally I have had great service at this location in the past. The visit on 2/26 however was a memorable visit for all the wrong reasons. The lady at the front counter happliy greeted the guest in front of me as well as the guest after me but for some reason not me. As the first point of contact with the representative, I did not feel welcomed or valued. Once I was called to review my policy loan for both my auto & home, the visit became  such that I felt it needed voicing. The woman who was supposed to assist me in ensuring my policy was working for me handled the entire conversation in a demeaning, condescending tone. I wanted to know why my policy had gone up just under $300 dollars this past year. I am not sure if she thought I was easily bullied but she offered no effort in ensuring my policy was up to date, or ways to ensure I was getting the best deal possible. I was treated as though I was wasting her time & once again of no value. I am very sad to have referred so many friends & family to the Eureka branch for their insurance needs.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1519759983483, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear that you have had a negative experience with us, Antonette!

The staff here were all very kind!  Being a large office, I wasn't expecting it.  Everyone that came into contact with me greeted me very warmly.  The agent I spoke to, Monica Hicks, was very friendly and had a lot to talk about as she was drafting a quote for me for a local 4 plex.  Any answers she didn't have, she quickly went to look for and got back to me.  I was very satisfied by the service I received at this branch.</review>

<Review>You can take care of most of your DMV needs as well as get/renew/pay for insurance or roadside service.  The service is always friendly, and wait is nonexistent to short.  The wait time is made nicer by free wifi and coffee.</Review>< Pics>

Over a couple of visits, the extremely friendly, professional staff at the Eureka office went above and beyond in assisting me to enhance my understanding of services, and, though they didn't need to gave my family added benefit for no add'l charge. Despite how busy the office was,  at one pt., 4 staff were making absolutely certain the information was exactly correct. This office has ALWAYS provided excellent customer service, and we'll be back, year after year, and decade after decade simply b/c no other Auto-related Emergency Service comes close to helping as they have over many years. It only takes one Emergency in the middle of nowhere, to make the annual fee more than worth it!  Btw, cudos to all staff, but Shannon has the constant smile that let's you know she is NOT ever faking patience nor at all worried about the extra time needed to answer questions.<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>This is a resort we like to go to, over and again, especially for spring skiing. Everything is so well done, lots of Covid safety rules, enforced by the lift operators. Good grooming keeps enough trails open to make it fun. Base village has reopened so plenty of food choices too. Pass works at Alpine Meadows which is smaller, quieter, very scenic. Worth a day for sure.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Our first visit and first time spring skiing as well.  The ski area is great.  The easier slopes higher on the mountain are really good, large and plenty of trails to learn quickly.  The blue slopes are challenging with different terrain in the mix.  I would definitely recommend Squaw/Olympic Valley for Every level of skier.< /Review><Time>1618543909985< /Time><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjVlaFTrByo8gwyyOK9BDWoT_DNZLCjvkaxa5g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfXUKTLhCMl58NEkVeWLjuQck9f3HDuUbyVvde=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4DUXBWiElSpui5QFoo9XfxA3chi-DOibEFVxc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< GmapID>

Love Squaw!  The grooming could be better though.  Lift operators are so helpful.  Ski Patrol everywhere.  Bathrooms are so new and clean!!  Lots of lifts and runs!  Wish they allowed overnight parking in the parking lots.  Urgent care on site.  Beautiful ski village and great and plentiful restaurants.  Great cell reception.  Covid careful ~ masks required, take out food and 25% capacity limit.< /text>

<Review>My favorite mountain in Lake Tahoe. All different type of terrain on the mountain. Excellent beginner runs at the top. And great progression park at Belmont lift. One lift dedicated for the small park is great for practicing small feathers. I have never seen any other like this in Lake Tahoe.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6uhc_0xn_dy-z7I06febNaQvbIQePGcBWUH3D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Always great starting at the Squaw Valley Lodge, especially with the kitchen amenities. The staff is super nice and helpful, and it's also nice to have covered parking for your vehicle during your stay so you don't have to brush off snow! Can't beat the ski-in ski-out either.</Text>

Lots of options for any level. I really enjoy skiing the Backside/ Granite Chief chair especially now in the spring. There is a nice balance of groomed and ungroomed terrain.<//review>

<Text>One of the best resorts in Tahoe to ski/snowboard, but the mountain just isn't worth $240 a day. Hate that they are making it this expensive to get up on the mountain. A single burrito costs $16 and it's super basic. Way too expensive for mediocre experiences. I would recommend flying to Europe at these prices. The snow is better, amazing après, and great food - raclette for days! Check out La Folie Douce in Chamonix.</Text><Date>1618334065742<//Date>< user_name>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Excellent ski resort close to the Reno Tahoe area. Famous for hosting the olympics many years ago. BEAUTIFUL VIEWS ALL AROUND!!! Great terrain for skiing here, tons of different lifts with dozens of runs all over the mountain. Lift lines are not too bad, but can be long during the busy weekends. Plenty of parking if you get there early in the AM. Lots of very difficult runs when the snow is good. Looking forward to skiing it more this winter season as well as Alpine Meadows just down the road.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Love the Squaw Valley Resort. Highly recommend this resort. Walking distance to the slopes, shopping and most of all, true resort luxury and tranquility.

Moved to this resort from Lake Tahoe Resort by Diamond, which was a disaster, which was a timeshare on life support trying to stay alive by renting the units, charging a resort fee like Vegas and a $100 a day additional deposit they use for 2 weeks as a slush fund.< /Text>

<Review>Beautiful mountains, great slopes. It was a little too late to go in April, will try March next time. The only issue we have had was when my daughter’s ski went backwards when she was getting off the lift, she fell twisting her knee, the chair ran over her and hit her in the head. The operator did not stop it on time, it kept going for another 3-4 seconds after she fell. When it finally stopped I and my husband had to jump down off the chair because it already went the other way. When we used the same lift later that day the operator was playing with his phone and not even looking at us. I was surprised because all other operators were staying next to the lifts and helping people to get off them.</Review>< user>

<review>Try to buy season pass 21-22 with active nurse license from ticket office. They say they cannot sell the pass with discount at ticket  office only through online. But the discount verification process was not possible  through  online. So why the discount announcement is there?<//review>< Pictures>

My family and I love the location. During the spring and summer days it is a great place to go hiking and walking. During the winter days it's a great place to go skiing and snow playing. Would come back here again.</text>

Squaw is such a great mountain. With the erratic weather this season were lucky we have such good coverage.
Alpine meadows is great as well, but when I'm at Alpine, I feel like I'm home.💗</Review>

One of my favorite mountains in Tahoe. The snow was pretty good this last weekend and resulted in a great time. It is nice to see them enforcing mask policy and keeping the lifts grouping low.< /Review>

<Review>I love the varied and vast amount of terrain Squaw has and the amount of amenities in the Village for apres ski.  The staff is very friendly and they were particularly helpful with this Covid season.  I can't wait till next year.<//Review>< Pictures>

Large parking area. Very friendly parking security.  No overnight RV parking in the lot, but available close by or in town. Very expensive 1 day ski ticket.  Decent shopping in the village.  Snow looked good.</review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Squaw is a great resort, lots of opportunities for beginners to learn in the beginner slopes or with the classes and for the more experienced skiers there are lots of hard and off trail slopes. There are plenty of restaurants to eat at after the skiing. The biggest issue with squaw is that everything is very expensive, from the tickets to the food, to the houses and rentals.< /Review>< pics>

This ski resort is awesome. I enjoyed some trails there like lakeview, shirley lake, ridge run and more. Also, this ski resort is clean. No wonder why is it one of the best ski resorts.< /review>

< Review>
I'm not a skier, but I love to stay here during the summer for hiking. The location is perfect for accessing most Tahoe trails. Prices are much more reasonable during the summer, and especially during the fall. The place is pretty dead in the fall. Most shops are closed, and restaurants are inconsistently open. And, for god sake, shop before you get there. Alice's Grocery is like shopping in Switzerland. Prices are ridiculous. Avoid that place like the plague.<//Review>

I visited here in July 2008 and took the cable car lift to the top 8200 ft.  The views are spectacular  and the museum dedicated to the 1960 olympics is very good. There was a large blown up picture of the scoreboard from the old Blythe Arena taken seconds before we beat the USSR.<//text>

Not because I grew up skiing Squaw Valley my whole life, but because they have actually done a great job to make the area safe during this covid time. So glad I took a day off midweek to avoid crowds! Friendly people, safe conditions, and beautiful scenery as always!</Text>

<Text>We have visited the resort by the end of August. It is a center for winter sports. But I liked it a lot. We have rented bikes and rode along Truckee river. The view is great right outside/back of the hotel. They have a very good swimming pool, as well. We had a room with a kitchenette. Rooms were clean, more like a studio apartment.< /Text><Time>1599421243907< /Time>< Response>

<review>This is my favorite ski resort in the Tahoe area, but the $220 adult price for even mid-week tickets during the President's Day week (Tuesday and Thursday) is obnoxious. Yes you can save if you buy a four pack, but that only works out if you want to only ski at this resort.  I have to admit, I now miss Alex Cushing...</review><response>None< /response><user>117465018761604622166< /user>< gmap_id>

There wasn't a ton of snow, but Squaw was still a blast. The runs are super fun and well maintained. There's a wide range of accessibility from easy to super challenging. Also, everyone working there was super friendly, from Ski patrol, to information, to the lift operators. I feel like it's a little confusing to find the entrance from the main ski lot, but if you just keep trekking through the village, you'll find the base. Can't wait to come back when there's fresh snow and I can hit the trees!</text>

Squaw Valley Resort (soon to lose its name) is the quintessential mountain resort.  Lodging, shopping, dining added to the ultimate draw of a mountain snow-sport experience in winter and hiking, trail running, and other outdoor sports in summer.  Olympic history, world class training opportunities, and unmatched scenery make it a must-see if ever in the North Tahoe area.</Review>

Had made a reservation a week in advance for April 28th at 90$. During the day they made an announcement that they were shortening lift operations and reducing the price to 50$. There was not way I could have known or be notified of this change and upon calling the ticket office they refused to refund me even partially. Incredibly frustrating experience. Nowhere in the itinerary or ticket contract does it say they are allowed to do this.<//review>

< Review>
Great skiing at Squaw valley! Beautiful mountain, lots of parking, tons of shops, restaurants a d bars at the base. Add to that a giant mountain with a wide range of skiing choices from pleasant groomed cruising to crazy steep, through the trees powder skiing. Nice lifts and gondolas. Well maintained and clean. A+ experience!< /Review>

I always have a great time here when I make it out to the Tahoe area.  Plenty of parking for carpooling (3+) and otherwise.  I also like the variety of shops and restaurants as well.  Extremely military friendly discount on season passes too!  You will enjoy this place.  Siberia runs are my favorite and they were able to open Siberia Express today.< /review>

Olympic Valley, classic winter destination, under new management. Past few years services and lifts have been dumbed down on weekdays but they are stepping up their game with new food and beverage standards and tons of fun extra curricular. Nestled in a picturesque valley with multiple peaks viewing to Tahoe and beyond. Get up here and feel it for yourself. Winter magic! Disco tubing Saturday’s. You can do it! Epic lights show. Tally ho!<//text>

<review>We came here for a hike.  It was cooler than the central valley and less smokey, plus so beautiful and a really nice place for family hiking!

Can't wait to come back when there's more water to hike along the waterfall.< /review>< Gmap_id>

I think this is the best ski resort in Tahoe. Variety of slopes for all levels plus it has great facilities. Only downside is the cost. The are very expensive, not just the lift tickets, but rental and food (which was not so god), but we are here for the snow...<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Top notch skiing facility. Dozens of runs, good lifts, and helpful staff. The views from the tram to High Camp are amazing. Whatever your proficiency level, Squaw Valley has you covered, from beginner (green) to pro/expert (double black diamond). And if you've never skied or snowboarded before, lessons are available.<//Review><time>1556017396805< /time><user>116324548454652591299<//user><user_name>Davis Johnson<//user_name><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZURoz_CqMnfvA1LRU2ssRbnRJAZZrjzXMZsce=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMczzwcDmogkRzMlN9fxqLrPTVKHt_avs34Fs1s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHGazLn77YI307yMnKSS1Dbs8popp3EFUT8zsp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjPk3V_A-Hr-2P8r3AaOIcQ2gM_2g9T2t3gdFK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6yWESTt4rG3TijOSBdIfDv6EbCoBEOfUtncdU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMp_Fv3mOu-ml1-8cNCK10pQCXqdXhqUgSThWd3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMo3PRJNQUXmqwxS6g5SC_3n4WjRu5OH4k7D84D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZDK5WieUvVxrvZoFGnowsWhqTsBJ2r7NBXF0W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHNvH-L1rzmCiYUijT6Pw8zk4rqJhRlaz9gT60=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiEzcSpFBX0TVP46RINB8WiK09YA6KvaunezgJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6F7VHf0LAruXUyABipSC--cobDn0EaZo44ERF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLIXQnI1zPeSPTLJSWMr_HNhC1txsI0a1RyKP1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><GmapID>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f< /GmapID></record>

One of the best resorts in Tahoe. They do an amazing job with events and the programing in the village. Aaron Tippet the events manager is a top notch human. Love working with him. They have music and fireworks every Saturday. Also Laser tubing. Not to mention the skiing and boarding is world class. Eat at one of the many restaurants in the village, my favorite is the Nectar spot, the wraps are DELICIOUS. Be sure to take a ride in the tram and head up to high camp. While you're there check out the Olympic museum or grab some food.< /Text>

<Text>Came after a storm on March 2nd and the pow pow was insane. There was no much snow at Siberia bowl run it was crazy. I literally couldn't see anything so when I fell I just fell on clouds cause it was so powder. It was definitely worth it tho I would suggest going after storm days and bringing good low light overcast goggles if it's cloudy or snowing.< /Text><user>103289654001809851967</user><Resp>{'time': 1551824384440, 'text': "Dear Steven,\nWe're glad you got to enjoy the powder!

Saw this company at Squaw Valley yesterday. People that did the rock climbing were so thrilled over it. We did not do it cause we had our dogs with us, but we will go up again and check out this activity.

What a great way to get out and enjoy this beautiful area!<//Text>

Second time boarding. This doesn't have much beginner terrain for first timers but it was still a great spot. Lots of food and drink places nearby on site and also when you take gondola higher.</Text>

Love the squaw valley resort! When the villages 100% open it's a great place to go and hang out and browse around especially during the winter time during ski season. Wish I could afford to stay there though but it's always great to go visit and shop and get great food. Had a great recent trip to Tremigo this summer. Great Mexican food in the village. Can't wait to visit again when things get back to normal.< /Review>

<review>This was my first time skiing ever, and luckily I got to ski with my daughter and her friend.

We went to Squaw Valley, one of the best Ski resorts in Tahoe. We were there on March 8, 2020. There was a lot of snow, which made Squaw more charming.

Squaw has plenty of parking and everyone working in squaw so friendly and professional. I was lucky to get Mr. Haz Nabulsi as my ski instructor. He is kind, funny, patient, and loves his job,  He made me feel like I’m with my brother the whole time I was skiing. I did fall a few times but I had a lot of fun. The best feeling was at the end when I took off my ski boots. :)

I love nature, and Mr. Nabulsi showed me all of the mountains on Lake Tahoe and even told me the name of each mountain. I highly recommend him to whoever is new to skiing. Thanks to Mr. Haz Nabulsi.

I plan to come back next year!< /review>< Pics>

<review>I just love Squaw Valley. I'm unfortunately physically incapable of skiing or participating in snow sports but the pleasure was insane. I've been a few times now and count it a privilege. Such a precious and beautiful part in the world. Blessed to see it, do go if you've opportunity, nothing was disappointing.< /review>< gmapID>

I really like the glades under red dog. When it is windy, they close the upper mountain for good reason, it is impossible to see and scary. But fun nonetheless.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUZewWqv3PiBpX_OkgOprJRXxTpwmMqn3Ei_np=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

I highly recommend this resort. Snow came early this year. There weren't many groomed runs and the ones we went on were icy. But the ungroomed areas were amazing! Not all the runs were open but we were able to hike up a run and ride down on powder. Such an azming day!!< /Text>

< review>
I am a owner and I stay here throughout the year. In winter they have a lift right from the hotel to the squaw mountain. The squaw mountain is beautiful, and for beginners and advanced use. At night the hotel has the prettiest sunset, in winter and summer. They have amazing activities such as, ice skating, hot tub and pool, and more. In the summer there is a golf course, a pool, crafts for kids, a bar, and much more. The only problem is if you want to get to a lake you have to drive a 15 minute drive there. But, have you ever seen a hotel with a lake and a lift to the mountain? I didn’t think so. On thing that really made my trip here awesome was the restaurants. They have Sandy’s Pub, Sweet Potatoes deli, I don’t know the name but a buffet, Montagna, and the most memorable place Six Peaks. This is so memorable by the sunset right next to you, the beautiful view, delicious food, and just the magical feeling of it. Another thing to add is they have adult and kid shops where you would find Sweet Potatoes. Overall this place is amazing for summer and winter please come her on you next trip to Tahoe< /review>

<Time>1534189492414<//Time><review>Great place for summer hiking in Tahoe. If you're looking to take a tram for "high-up" views during the summer, choose Squaw Valley over Heavenly. You can get quality lake views at free lookouts around the lake. You can't get mountain/meadow views like you get at the top of the tram at Squaw.

Last tram returns to the base village at 5:30pm so plan ahead. There's a ton of family friendly hiking at the top, and a small restaurant at the top too (although restaurants at the base village are probably better). Be sure to check out the Olympic museum!</review><Resp>None<//Resp>< Pics>

Lift ticket prices are inflated here like most other resorts. Chili cheese fries are a good value, ton of calories for 11 bucks. Skiing was good but not all lifts running, could have more staff for the price of a pass to run more chairs.</Review>

Mountain is great, but their equipment needs renewal. Scratches on windows, peeled paint, hotel  feels old. If they won't remodel soon, it ll go down. Northstar is much better maintaining their resort.</review>

Overall it's great! Best meal by far at PlumpJack ...did social distancing well and great food and service.  Alice's Market is a place we won't go back to...grump guy and he wanted a tip because we bought canned/bottled beverages from him and he didn't even provide bottle opener.  Coffee bar excellent and Starbucks great.  Great ambiance...Mind Play is excellent toy store.<//Review>

IKON pass discounts on food and merchandise all day any day. High Camp hot tub party is a spring ski must visit. SVAM parks crew works hard into summer, keeps the big jumps snow conditioned and plenty of rails.< /review>< pics>

<user_name>Alvin Newman</user_name><Date>1516655565694< /Date><rate>4</rate><review>The resort was excellent, and the rooms very well furnished. We had a two bedroom suite that included a king bed in one room and a full size bed in the second, with a pull out couch in the living room. Living room had beautiful views of the mountain, a very nice fireplace, and a full kitchen.
We were literally steps from the tram going up mountain in the morning, which made skiing and returning to the rooms very easy. There is indoor parking,  an elevator,  two hot tubs in the building, an exercise room, and various firepits spread through the resort.
On the negative side, food at the restaurant was fairly expensive since this is resort so I would recommend taking advantage of the kitchen and preparing at least some meals in. I also rented skis for 3 days, and the rental cost me $150. You may want to consider renting your equipment locally rather than at the resort.
Overall, I had a great time and we'll definitely do it again.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYWMbZmALJq0xDd74fAzF_JkcaS2227f4eqNYY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>I have been an avid supporter of Squaw valley not only as a visitor but as skier.

If the name is changed I will never set foot on your property.
This is an iconic venue with Olympic status.
To change the name would be a crime. We need to evaluate the crisis going on and make decisions that are not made due to pressure.</Text><name>Lucas Milburn<//name><Date>1592875427315</Date>< Resp>

Finally got to the slopes and I took the tram to the higher part of the mountain. The view is super pretty and the snow was great. There was a lot of people on the weekend but not super annoying where you feel like everyone is constantly in your way. The staff is nice and the lines go by quickly.

Overall, I enjoyed snowboarding here. Lift tickets and rentals were expensive though! It almost $150 for lift and $50 for rentals. Eeeks!<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Squaw Valley! Home to the 1960 Winter Olympics! So you also get access to Alpine Meadows with your lift ticket but I didn't have time to check it out. The resort is hugely spaced out with lots of open runs and wide open powder bowls. I will say that compared to Heavenly and Northstar, the runs are mostly shorter. There are some VERY advanced areas though, so if you want some challenging runs they definitely have them. The village is pretty nice, not as nice as Northstar's but has a better apres.<//text><rate>4< /rate>< Gmap_id>

Stayed in a 1 bedroom, 1 den suite. Ended up being a 2 bedroom 2 bath. It was very spacious and comfortable. Since it's in the village, it's just a short walk to the trams up the mountain or to the rentals.

All day Squaw kids were great for our 4, 6, and 8 year old children. They all loved it and got a taste for skiing.

The beginner lessons for us parents were great as well. It was our first time ever and the instructors were very friendly and insightful.<//text>

I thought Squaw was great in the summer but it's even better in the winter. It helped that we had over two feet of fresh snow while we were there, but even without that it was a perfect trip. The staff at Squaw Kids, ski rentals, lift ticket windows and ski lifts were all really friendly and helpful and everything you need is a short walk away through the village. Squaw for Christmas is my new favorite vacation.< /Review>

Great place for the whole family. Kids loved it, lots of activities for them. Great restaurants and shopping. Game rooms for kids, small theater room you can bring your own movies in and watch on a big screen. Hot tubs in the Snow! Fun all around.< /text>

<review>Amazing resort, great trails for all levels (even beginners will find lots of fun) and also plenty of intermediate and advanced ones. The infrastructure is awesome, with lots of lodging options and restaurants. I strongly recommend. Plan to stay 4 days and save purchasing the 'tahoe super 4' pack, much cheaper than the day pass. Renting equipment is more expensive at the resort than on the sorrounding areas, so O recommend Dave's place...good equipment at good price. Loved it!<//review>< date>

<Review>I used to not like Squaw as it seems either for  beginners or experts and not much middle. It does take some getting used to finding your way around I've now found great terrain and grooming. Still like Alpine better as it's friendlier but now you can ski both on the same pass.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Thankfully I ended up going on a good year. The season in 2017 has been helped significantly by the end of a drought and a lead into significant snow. I met a local who had lived in the area while skiing and he said that it was possibly the best conditions it had been in over 20 years. Two issues come with that. Firstly, I caught a ski bus from San Francisco (NAC) at 4am, which arrived at Truckee at 9am but took a further 2 1/2 hours to reach the resort and another 30 minutes to start skiing. It doesn't help this is the first time skiing in the US, and that comparisons can only be made with Japan (which had world leading transport infrastructure - this type of delay would be unheard of), and Sydney, Australia which still has resorts twice the distance this is from San Francisco, yet I would still have reached the resort earlier. Anyone else coming all this way should stay at the resort. Even Truckee would be a stretch. This early in the morning, all the cars were being turned around. That said, it was a public holiday weekend and possibly expected.
Once skiing though, all was forgiven. The conditions were superb, and lines although long, progressed quickly due to many of the chairs being either high speed or high in seat number. There were a lot of places where I could take in the slopes without anyone else around.
The price though..... you have to be kidding. Another unfortunate result of being able to compare with Japan is that the price of my lift ticket at Squaw would have paid for four days of skiing in Japan, including accomodation, food and hiring of all gear and equipment - with double the annual snowfall. Regardless - still worth of a decent amount of stars. I'll be back!< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcUc6NYjvL9XeRGGJgzUzf808G1qOIUzhi8oxa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNH803j8xL_luAhE9k2b0izQ7WpN4c11uL6Sm4K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWUly6QaAkb1DTWstHdAWUHvZWwo6U6Aairkt1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZhydUUWw-KzUCAtIpcQozwhyBF0EFZfC2u04c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOymV2AOh5C5kCDWxB141leJkOh1Us4pKM5Appo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPY683vdskyIpir5EL61Z7Urxtz5GJhqwU6TYZv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjNK5MC3Da8l4wM8t4lpNxPymaHkGkwjdRjECI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOauCKhr6uaCF0Rb_gF55CqcoFr52WTp80agbHm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0YwACvzle5YQR9EdbjPlz3pA2-IDSRobN8Y9A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<review>Well, snowboarding is always fun so four stars but I did honestly expect longer runs for somewhere so highly celebrated. This is my first time there when it hasn't been storming and the lifts are actually open though so I haven't seen too much of the mountain yet. Likewise, not much snow this season, not yet, so nothing black was open to ride and powder wasn't an option. As always, I recommend mid-week for shorter lines at the lifts.
Went to the board shop for a stomp pad and they were super helpful and put the pad on for me with the heat gun and everything. Good pricing for what I expect to see at any resort let alone one of this much attraction.
I didn't hit the Irish pub this trip but I highly recommend dropping in for your drink of choice and their loaded tots: awesome, delicious, warm, comfort food perfect for any cold day.
During the summer I hike up there too and it's got plenty o good trails for that and running of course, given it's the start point for the Western States 100, or mountain biking.
The pool there is also a good spot to hang on an off-day from the dirt. The food at the cafe there is pretty good, you can get drinks, and the pool itself is a good layout for chillin out.
If you haven't been yet I also recommend checking out the Olympic museum there; pretty cool stuff in there.<//review></record></dataset><record>

There not prepared for covid times. The price is for all the amenities you can't use. What am I waisting my money on? This doesn't feel like a family friendly place. Our view is of weeds is underwhelming.< /review>

<Text>Squaw Valley is my favorite playground as a local resident but it is also my fav as a wedding and even portrait photographer. So many backgrounds to choose from and Squaw offers A+ service for planning and venues. You can choose High Camp , the decks, OVL...  all this with village lodging. Worth a visit for sure:)< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Loved it, the town is awesome and even though I went during summer and covid times, it is fun to visit, lots of free air, lots of space to distance yourself and just to wake up to lovely weather is awesome. Service was good, only exception is the drain from the shower was clogged, took for ever to drain the water, but the hospitality is great over all, willing to give a second chance? Yes, the cancelation takes about 14 business days to see the money back, that was another negative I noticed, staff is very helpful and understanding. It is not their fault about refund process, staff is 5/5 stars.</Review>

<review>What's not to love? This is a huge ski area with plenty of terrain for all skill levels, accessible by a wide variety of lifts from funiculi and aerial tram (which allow descents as well so beginners aren't forced to ski beyond their limits to the base) as well as traditional chairs. Most every one of the staff members were friendly and helpful. There is a mountaintop pool and hot tub (for an added fee) and many other amenities around the village. There is a family of chubby marmots roaming among the peaks for your viewing pleasure. And it's gorgeous.</review>< pictures>

Great terrain but long lines. highly recommend Dawn Patrol on Saturdays to get first on the mountain before the crowds. Great village with food, bars, and shops< /review>

Great mountain with one of the best terrain in Tahoe. Plenty to keep busy a skier or snowboarder if any level. Beginner area is mid mountain so even beginners can  get "high". Free parking can get tight on weekends so get there early. Paid parking is free with 3+ people in the car. Facilities are good but food is expensive.<//Review>

FYI - we no longer have paid parking at Squaw Valley, but one of the main lots is dedicated to carpool parking with 3 or more passengers. This initiative is meant help reduce traffic on busy weekends & also reduce carbon emissions. It's still good advice to arrive early :)"}</response>

<Review>Def Nice spot to shred with a beautiful Gondola ride up to mid mountain area where they have Restaurant, Bar, Restrooms, etc. And then just hop on the lifts from there.  Steeper stuff is on the small lift that goes up from the base lodge actually!!<//Review>< resp>

Super expensive! 170 for a day of skiing. They don't check your pass after the gondola so I suggest buying a single ride. Food is crazy expensive too. Just go to France, Austria or Italy...<//review>

Great spot, huge mountain with good food options in the lodge. We liked the team that took you up in a covered seated team for a 3 mile downhill run. This was the only way to handle the cold rainy day on the mountain New Years Day< /Review>

<Review>This is one of my favorite resorts in Tahoe. They have a ton of variety in their runs and it's a big resort so I can come multiple days in a row and not do the same runs over and over. If you haven't tried the cookies it's definitely a must for the end of a long snow day!< /Review>< userid>

The Tuesday Bluesday Concert at Squaw Valley Resort, has become a summer tradition for us! The crowd and music are amazing and the location is steller! If you ever have the chance to visit the Reno Tahoe area in the summer, I highly recommend you book one of the Bluesday room specials in the village, ($99 for a 1 bedroom, full kitchen condo unit!), bring some hiking shoes and bikes, along with your favorite snacks and beverages, and turn it into a 2 day mountain escape! You will not regret it!🎶</text>

This review is on the tubing. I should say Disco Neon Tubing which cost about $50/hr and much be prescheduled.

It’s a lot of fun, you may think it’s childish but it’s not. Just watch out as it was slippery and people were flying into other lanes.</text>

The best ski resort in the Sierra's. I also worked at the other end of the lake. The area was a great ski area, but our customers drove me back to Vermont. Squaw Valley USA does rock!! Your customers are way better and the terrain is awesome! This is coming from a guy who grew up a  Vermont skier. Keep up your great Squaw vibe and run it the way it is supposed to be. Go Squaw and keep keeping it real!!!< /Text>

<Text>Best Tahoe ski resort. Brilliant powder days, terrain for all levels, good food options, great access and parking. There is so much terrain that despite the large number of people that come to squaw, the slopes never feel crowded and lift lines are fairly quick. On both Ikon and Mountain Collective season passes, the 4-pack lift ticket is another economical option.

KT-22 is the best!</Text><gmapID>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f<//gmapID><Name>Ashish Vora< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Been coming here for years. My favorite place in Tahoe and in the American West. So glad this resort hasn't gone corporate ugly in the way other places have. It's friendlier, fun, varietal, and there is never a day where the beauty on the mountain isn't absolutely exquisite.< /Review>

<Text>Terrain options are impressive, snow can be outstanding but can also be absolutely garbage with only 3 chairs open and they'll still charge $165.  Be prepared to pay out the nose to enjoy the beautiful scenery from the hour long lift line waits. But in all honesty it is a phenomenal experience absolutely worth it but make sure you explore every single discount available to make even more worth it.<//Text><response>{'time': 1577309742386, 'text': 'Hello Kalen. Thank you very much for taking the time to review us. The best way to save on lift tickets is always to buy in advance rather than at the window. If you are ever feeling overwhelmed by the action at Squaw Valley, check out our neighbor, Alpine Meadows, which is a laidback, old school spot. It is a totally different feel from Squaw! We hope you will visit again soon and are glad to hear that you had a phenomenal experience. Best, Liz'}</response><name>Kalen Edwards< /name>< Rate>

We are a family of 3 (includes a toddler). We don't ski/snow-board but love to be around snow. This place is ideal for someone like us. Great eating places, the ride to the highland is worth it even if you are not skiing. Good idea to out your name down at the pizza place so that you  explore and come back to a ready table. We almost missed the huge food court at the back, incase you want that kind of a meal.<//text>

Squaw valley offers arguably the best skiing in the state of California. Situated in north Lake Tahoe, Squaw stands apart from other local mountains by offering significantly larger acreage, high capacity/high speed chairlifts, typical ski-resort amenities and a variety of events & extracurriculars. Because squaw caters to both local skiers and destination/travel skiers you can expect long lift lines and large crowds at lunch spots and apres. Like many mountains in North America parking and traffic (in & out) of Squaw valley is a bummer. Especially the traffic. Plan your day accordingly and do yourself a favor and stop for a drink or browse the various shops; leaving at 4pm to go to truckee or Tahoe city could easily mean an 1hr+ drive. Squaw offers a lot of varied terrain that will almost certainly satisfy most people. Personally, I’m a much bigger a fan of alpine meadows (also owned by squaw) but most of my friends would favor Squaw. I will say squaw does seem a little dangerous at times and could use a bit more roping-off and signage for rocks, cliffs, obstructions, etc. This shouldn’t be too much of a worry since Skiing by definition is a dangerous sport. Lastly, the snow in California is and always will be California snow. Do not expect Rocky Mountain conditions. Obviously some years will be better than others but more often than not, snow isn’t great. 2018-19 season did happen to be one of the best I’ve seen in a long time so pray to the snow gods they will give us a repeat.</review>

<response>{'time': 1583457777972, 'text': "Hello Taylor. Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a long, informative review about Squaw Valley. We are glad that you enjoy our world-class skiing and diverse terrain here, and we appreciate you voicing your other concerns as well. Your recommendations regarding visiting Truckee or Tahoe City as part of a trip are great. As far as parking goes, we have also introduced or contributed to a number of traffic-reducing and parking initiatives such as a free shuttle service, free regional buses, carpool parking, an increased number of parking spaces, a park and ride in both Truckee and Tahoe City, better snow removal equipment, and a better guided directional flow in our parking lots. This is an important issue to us, and we will continue to improve upon it wherever possible. We appreciate that you recommended Alpine Meadows as well, which is one of Lake Tahoe's best-kept secrets. Thank you for giving practical advice to our future guests! - Liz W"}<//response><gmap_id>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
This place was highly recommended by friends and the history here made this an attractive resort to visit. The day (a Monday) we arrived it was very easy to rent demo equipment, get tickets and take the gondola up. I did pre-purchase my ticket and rental online which made the process easier. However, I will say the website could use some small improvements for online purchasing. It was **VERY** windy that day, all the peak lifts on the West side were closed, sadly. The mountain was otherwise wide open from the gondola and to the East, and lines were pretty much non-existent. It would have been a great day to bring kids to practice.

However, what made this awesome was the great customer service. Staff were nice while we were there but more importantly, they also were kind to us after we left. Idiotically, I left my helmet, goggles, and goPro attached at the demo shop's bench. I didn't realize this until I was driving past Sacramento toward the bay to fly out the next day. I didn't catch the resort operator before they closed so rang them in the morning frantically. Lost and found didn't have it (my heart dropped), but luckily I reached the demo shop person, Mo, remembered me and helped me out. She then brought it over to the shipping department where Anthony shipped my gear to back to me on the East coast. A couple days later it showed up. I did pay for shipping getting my helmet back but that is inconsequential to getting my helmet that has been with me for over a decade and the gopro footage/memories was priceless.

To Mo and Anthony, MANY MANY THANKS! I'm definitely repping Squaw Valley on my helmet!<//Review>

This place will be memorable for me as in here I have experienced my very first encounter with the snow. The place is a historic one because it was the site of the 1960? Winter Olympic. It's worth the long drive from San Francisco to this lovely place.</review>

I came here this winter and last winter, and it's alright! The slopes aren't too varied and the snow quality wasn't super great, but the runs are quite wide. The runs aren't too long though, and the lines are quite long. Thankfully, there are single lines though so that makes waiting a bit shorter. The parking lot is huge, and the gondola is quite good.<//review>

Great place to go with a lot of good runs. Lift tickets are $170 for one day for adults, so it's best to find a friend with an Ikon pass to get you a discount, which brings it to about $128 for a one day pass. The sometimes have fireworks at night and live music. Fun town with a bunch of places to eat or grab a drink.</Text>

Nice place to stay for mountain views and chilling out. The restaurants are good for families. The shops are fun to browse. We usually come here in the off season (late spring or summer), so it's pretty quiet at those times.< /review>

The lift tickets are expensive, but there is so much great terrain at every level. You could ski KT-22 and the Headwall all day. Check the lift status before you head to the mountain. On a great day, be prepared to wait in lift lines in the morning. The food and post-ski options are average - we had very dry sandwiches and waited a long time for beer. My mom has had a bad experience with the ski patrol people here, so look out for your own!< /review>

Great place for a afternoon walk. However, during summer it can be a bit quiet and the stores are more targeted towards skiing supplies. So, if you are looking for a place to shop for other things, this is not the place for you. However, the history of the place and architectures are very well maintained, and is worth appreciating.< /Review>

<rating>4</rating><text>The resort/ village is awesome and beautiful! The best skiing is definitely upper mountain but lower mountain is very good too. The powder is magic! I feel there is a good mix of black turn blue trails. Then of coarse there are pure adrenaline runs and easy sliders. When everything is running lines are minimal to perfect. The weather is a tricky balance when planning a trip. High winds, avalanche control, or initial rain turn snow can snuff out a couple days. Overall we have been lucky to catch at least 2-3 good skiing days out of 4-5 day stays we have had in our three trips here (Dec '16, Mar '18, Feb '19). I was able to get refunded as an out of stater instead of a snow check. Staff is great! I know it is a little pricey but as an east coast dweller the experience is worth the splurge.</text>< pictures>

Though the daily ticket prices are a bit extreme this resort is well ran with quite a few runs. I went early in the season and they already had 4 different runs open. Great resort would go again.< /text>

<username>Hannah Pence</username><text>Squaw Valley is the biggest mountain around Lake Tahoe.  It is pretty far driving from South Lake (over 1 hour) but not a bad drive from Incline, Truckee, or Reno. It's gorgeous in the winter and summer. On Memorial Day annually they host a Made-in-Tahoe event with local artisans, food vendors, and live music...easily my favorite event of the year. Stunning backdrop of alpine meadows and the dramatic cliffs of squaw valley ski resort. Truly beautiful year round at Squaw Valley resort.< /text></record>

Given the lack of snowfall at the time, the groomed runs were excellent. Also the staff were helpful when needed.
It is an expensive trip so plan accordingly.< /Review>

Beautiful getaway summer or winter. Many restaurants and shops. Ski lifts for in and out. Lots of hiking options and close to Lake Tahoe and Truckee for even more options. The area has a European ski village atmosphere. Recommend.</Review>

<Text>Best resort in the Lake Tahoe area, hands down. Best beginner area, best double-black terrain and best infrastructure (lifts, village, etc.) Even though it's more expensive than every other resort, you get what you pay for. With more than 4,000 skiable acres, you can spend an entire winter here and not ride every run. This place caters to everyone...but, actually, don't go here because it's already too packed.

We came up on November 20th and were surprised to find no crowds and 3+ feet of relatively fresh snow up at High Camp. Was a perfect time to bring beginners up the hill to practice turns before the holiday season begins and floods of people come up from the city and dump off their rude, entitled punk children on the beginner slopes who tend to ruin the experience for others.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2OvGIwLCbXA5fhzXDZEDVds2Rd0DVYPMcP9Hp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Came by in June so I wasn't going skiing but wanted to check the place out to see if it would be worth the trip when I want to go to a place to ski.  It definitely would be.  Besides the awesome skiing it would be there was a lot of nice shops and places to eat.  Lots of room to lodge as well.  I'm already starting to plan my next ski trip.</Review>

<Review>Great resort but I really don't thing the management were prepared for the weather and crowds.  Online information was not being updated or was wrong, shuttle services were running at a fraction of the posted times, and several ski runs were closed even though many people were skiing them quite safely.  Too early to tell.< /Review><resp>{'time': 1576197851629, 'text': "Hello Tom. Thank you for taking the time to leave a review with comments.

Room was nice, good size and bed was comfortable... Location is great... Right next to lifts if you're sking. Staff was friendly. Could use more to the fitness area and hot tub are was not impressive, but it was snowing so,  but if you're in the building and not outside in the snow or nature... You went to squaw valley for the wrong reason. All in all had a awesome stay.</Text>

Great slopes with nice amenities, polite and helpful staff, and the App makes the experience:  download the App with friends and track your ski/snowboard runs, find your friends, enjoy you day with a map on your mobile!

Great visit during the summer for visitors that don't ski! The aerial tram was a great alternative to the heavenly gondola which doesn't open until the end of June. Wonderful views of the lake and mountains,  lots to do at high camp like swimming and roller skating. Plenty of free parking.</text>

Awesome resort if you're looking for good natural terrain. The terrain park is pathetic, but why ride park when you have good snow on the rest of mountain?<//Review>

Lots of runs to accommodate different levels. The Broadway run is the best for beginners for many reasons: 1. Great view, 2. High elevation, and thus, 3. Soft power snow comparing to beginner runs in other resorts.<//Review>

Wow! Sushi, Coffee, Dogs everywhere, hiking, ample parking, and maps, public restrooms... It's actually a pretty cool place to spend the day during the off season because although it's a skiing mecca during winter, it's kind of a day hiker's paradise because of all the amenities.< /review>

<review>Resort has a nice vibe with plenty of bars and restaurants to choose. Some rooms have good views of the slopes, some don't. Overall, it's what you'd expect for a ski resort. Our condo was comfortable but the most basic inexpensive (think dorm quality) appliances and old furniture don't impress.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1557547012392, 'text': "Dear Marty,\nWe're glad to hear you had a nice time at the resort--we hope you were able to soak up some sun and mountain views!

We went in the off season before the snow rolled in so we basically had the place to ourselves. I will definitely stay here again on my future trips to Lake Tahoe. I highly recommend this place.<//text><Resp>None< /Resp><user>104666373360482298627< /user>< Time>

<Text>Great resort overall. But I found myself stuck in a few concave grounds while snowboarding to unfamiliar slopes. My gf was a beginner and she got stuck very often. To her, this place was much worse than mammoth.

The resort overall could be much better labeled. It was easy to get lost on the slopes without constantly looking at your map.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1578355624577, 'text': 'Hello Ricky.

Stunning natural beauty and the best customer service make Squaw Valley a place you'll want to return to again and again and again. Everyone, from the ticketing staff, the ski rental/demo staff, the lift operators and the ski patrol have been exceedingly friendly and genuinely helpful. We truly feel welcome every time we come to Squaw Valley Resort. This is the happiest place on Earth, not that other place in southern California.</Text>

<rating>5</rating><gmapID>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f< /gmapID><review>Expensive ski resort, but the mountain is world class. I was not a particularly skilled snowboarder the first time I came here, but because the mountain is so large there is truly something for everyone. Just be sure that you know the potential routes for each lift before you head up the mountain, so you don't get in over your head. Have fun -- Squaw is a place where you can learn a lot and explore like crazy!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<time>1587058834376</time><user_id>103903225066695251689</user_id><user_name>Arthur Zarins< /user_name>< Review>
Up until the 2019/2020 season, I was using the Epic pass so I could ski Northstar, Heavenly, and Kirkwood. I tried an IKON pass this season (so I could have a trip to Mammoth), and I was a little worried about having only one mountain to ski in Tahoe on the IKON pass: Squaw Valley. Even though this season was shortened due to Covid19, I was completly blown away by how amazing Squaw Valley was a ski destination.

Firstly, the chairlifts are amazing. The iconic KT-22 chair is a high-speed quad, making lines during midday nonexistant (unless there was a huge powder dump). However, the chairlifts only get better. Headwall Express and Siberia Express, the two chairs that go to the top of the mountain with advanced terrain, are both 6-seaters. In addition, Intermediate chairlifts Gold Coast Express, Shirley Express, and Far East Express are all 6-seaters too! The Beginners won’t be dissapointed either, as beginner lift Big Blue (False advertising?) is also a 6-seater! All in all, we get:

-6 express 6-seater lifts
-2 express 4-seater lifts
-9 slow chairlifts that run daily
-4 slow chairlifts that run rarely

Secondly, the advanced terrain is going to be a lot better than other areas. Like falling down chutes and being watched from several chairlifts? The Palisades are for you. Don’t like crowds? Head over to Granite Chief chair or the Silverado ski territory. Want to see the US’ best chairlift and lift-served ski terrain? Head on over to KT-22 Express - it’s up there with chair 23 at Mammoth for interesting chair rides. If you go up KT-22 Express and you get scared, take a right at the top, and take Saddle, the easiest way down (called a double blue, but it’s not that hard). For those who want to spend a whole day at KT-22, Saddle Face, Olympic Lady, and Schimmelpfenning Bowl are great trails to warm up on. G.S. Bowl is also a great run, although be careful, as it’s a long way to the bottom if you fall.

Sadly, there's a character limit, so I can't get into detail on Intermediate/Beginner terrain, but it exists, is good, and is serviced with high-speed 6-seater chairlifts!

And the ski mountain is going to expand too! A California Express Gondola has been approved, and it will link Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows, and (based on the blueprint) the backside of KT-22 (a.k.a. Troy Caldwell’s white wolf mountain) into one single ski resort! This Gondola will have 4 stations: Bottom of Squaw Valley, Top of KT-22, Bottom of KT-22 backside (the most odd and interesting one), Bottom of Alpine Meadows. I can’t wait for this gondola to be built in the future, as this plan has been going for quite some time. If you take the KT-22 chairlift to the top and go straight, you will see an unfinished KT-backside chairlift that just needs a cable and chairs on it to run. I’m confident that this chair will start running once the Gondola is built and functioning, and that this new territory will be opened up for everyone. However, this will remove the Red Dog chairlift, which will disrupt the whole East side of Squaw, as only Squaw Creek would get to the peak of Snow King, as Far East Express doesn’t go the full height. Given that the owner is replying to some of the reviews, I would like to know what’s going to happen after the California Gondola is installed, and Red Dog is removed. Will there be a Platter lift from the top of Far East Express to the top of Snow King? Will Red Dog’s base terminal simply be put higher up the mountain? Will the backside of KT-22 open up? Will the Olympic lady chair become obsolete, and be removed (it doesn’t run much already)? If the Olympic lady chair is removed, will it be relocated to Alpine Meadows or the backside of KT-22? No matter what happens, it looks like the iconic KT-22 chair will remain open, which I think we can all agree that it is more important than the Snow King area.

And that’s all I have to say about Squaw Valley!<//Review>

<review>Always best terrain and best snow. Operations are not as good as used to be before new corporate owners. Ski school is meh (kids don't learn much - you have to pay $$$$ for privates to really see improvmnt.) Applaud investment in express lifts, but staff doesn't do much. No traffic control in the lines and on slopes. Congestion points are a mess and super dangerous. More signs, ropes and mesh dividers aren't really helping!!<//review><gmapID>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f<//gmapID><user_name>Christina Van Zandt</user_name>< Resp>

<rate>4</rate><text>There are a few things I'm not tremendously fond of with Squaw, first is the crowds, second is the lack of trees on the ski terrain, and third is how quick they are to close the ski lifts on stormy days. There's a lot that I like, such as Squaw is amazing when you catch an event or day of skiing that's not too busy. I have been fortunate to be able to attend events on days that attract smaller crowds and I have always had such a lovely time. The resort is beautiful with great food options. The pool is super awesome. The terrain is fun to ski/ride. There's something for everyone.< /text>< pics>

This resort offers pretty good skiing and the views are amazing, However:
1) Even though the weather was really good today (apart from a little wind) they decided to close a part of the mountain which meant a lot of lines to the chairlifts and busy slopes. Which caused quite a few accidents.
2) They also closed a couple of runs to prepare for a ski competition a week ahead. In a couple of places they left narrow steep passage, along with the ice this felt pretty dangerous. And indeed someone eventually broke their collar bone because they ran into another person.
3) Ski pass is ridiculously expensive. And also the food. $12 for a bowl of chili? $13 for a chicken sandwich?
4) none of the chairlifts had a bar to put your skis/snowboard on so they had to hang in the air.
5) The entrance to almost all the chairlifts is downhill, so with the ice today people ended up sliding into the person in front.
6) When you get out of the chairlift you need to walk uphill before you can slide down. Who designed this?< /Text>

The lift operators and guest services are all individually helpful above any expectation I could've set. Terrain: out of this world.

Great place, but it gets busy, especially in the winter with people skiing. Here’s what you can do while you’re here.

On the ground:
Take a peek into the window of the building housing the gondolas. It’s fun to watch.

If you go down to the restrooms below the building housing the trams, remember to go over to the window. You can see what makes the trams go.

Go to the restaurants and shops

Sometimes, you can do the rock climbing, mini golf, and the slack line thing between some trees. When they aren’t going, be sure to check out the lifts on the ground that take people up to ski. It’s fun to sit on them when they aren’t moving.  Also, they have bungee jumping sometimes.

Up on the mountain where the tram takes you:

Skating

Swimming

Hiking around

Skiing (I believe)

Be sure to check out Squaw Valley! It’s a lot of fun.< /text>

<text>Could be better. Conditions were amazing for late spring skiing but ( from what I'm guessing is ) a business decision to close an entire side of the mountain by shutting off a bunch of lifts. Can't blame them though because traffic was light. Alternately, light traffic meant more mountain to ourselves. ;)<//text><gmap_id>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f<//gmap_id>< time>

{'time': 1578430107153, 'text': 'Hi Aaron. Thank you for taking the time to review Squaw Valley Resort. We recognize that traffic has been a major issue with resort access over the past few years. Please know that we have been working tirelessly on a number of initiatives to improve this issue including a free Park & Ride in Truckee on peak days, the free On-Demand Mountaineer Shuttle Service that takes people anywhere in either valley, contributing to making the local TART buses free, and a carpool parking program. We also worked with the county to get Squaw Valley Rd widened, and we three-lane the access road on peak days.

Huge area. Some fast lifts over good variety of terrain. But not cheap. Especially if too full so you have to use the obnoxious pay lot:(.

Re: Reply--But will the pay parking be back again early next season like it was? What's the justification for it?< /Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1556064455846, 'text': "Hi Mike,\nAs far as I've heard, there are no plan to reintroduce pay parking next season, but the POW carpool lot for cars with 3 or more people will remain. Our goal with POW Parking is to encourage our guests to carpool to help reduce our carbon footprint and combat the traffic congestion issues we deal with daily in the Tahoe area. The paid parking option was available earlier this season to allow vehicles with fewer than 3 people to park in that carpool lot, but we eliminated the paid option earlier this season and reverted the lot back to carpool-only parking.\nThanks for asking! :-) We hope to see you again next season in one of our free or carpool lots!\nCheers,\nAnne\n\nOriginal response on 4/17:\nDear Mike,\nThank you for visiting Squaw Valley and for taking the time to leave a review. We no longer offer a public paid parking lot, but both resorts do offer carpool parking for cars with 3 or more people. Thank you again for your visit--we hope you get to enjoy our mountain again soon.\nKind regards,\nAnne"}</Resp>< gmapID>

Great resort, if you carry 3+ you are eligible for free parking, right next to the tram. Squaw even has golf carts zooming between the parking lot and tram entrance, very convenient.
The upper mountain terrain can be windy as it is very exposed, especially during storms, if it is not raining at the base go there.</review>

The place is legendary for the slopes and beauty. But never eat ant food there, it was terrible. Due to bad weather the gonfola was non operational. So we missed the best part and got the most non desirable part of the dinner experience.< /Text>

Love that place! Nice shops, restaurants, fire pits. Beautiful mountain view and lift that takes you up to the mountains even in summer time to Olympic Valley. A bit too pricey though for a lift itself during non skiing season which is  $23 or so..< /Review>

Beautiful resort, host to the olympics in the day. Tons of terrain to shread. Families take the Funitel to the Gold Coast base where most of the beginner terrain and a good deal of intermediate terrain sit in a beautiful bowl area with access to about 6 lifts that will entertain most all day long. High camp has food and Gold Coast along with exterior seating weather permiting. Now for the more advanced head up top on  siberia or headwall for lots of open face bowls or on backside toward granite chief for some trees and steeps. Also at the base you can hit kt22 or red dog for an  additonal load of advanced terrain. This mountain offers lots of fun for all levels, friends and family alike. Certainly lessons from noob to advanced available for riding and skiing. Weekends can be very crowded, mid week if able, rocks. Have a blast and winter it up.< /text>

Not what it used to be. It used to be an iconic resort with unbelievable terrain and a wonderful ski culture. Now it is nothing more than a holding on the books of an investment company. They don't care about skiing and they could care less about the customer experience.

I'm sure someone in the marketing department will reply to this review and say how much they care about their customers, but I can assure you they don't operate the mountain as if they do. These days they spend way more time marketing the mountain and making sure it is constantly packed (which it is) than they do making an effort to operate the mountain and open terrain. 2,3,4 days after a storm they still struggle to get areas of the mountain open and they make excuses and whine on social media like there's no tomorrow. If it snows, they shut down. If it's windy, they shut down. I can probably count on one hand the amount of days that all the lifts have been running on the same day this season. The bottom line is that they either have no idea how to run a ski area or they just don't bother to do it because it isn't profitable enough for them.

If I were ranking the mountain on the terrain, it would be a 5, the mountain is awesome. Unfortunately the people running it bring it down to 2/5 stars. It really is sad, I love Squaw with all my heart. I wish they could pull it together and run as smoothly as they did when Alex Cushing owned it.<//Text>

We've been coming here for years. Summer or winter, the resort"s service is top class as are the amenities. The area and views are breathtaking. Focusing in on the property only, they have fun activities for adults/kids/families at either no cost or a reasonable fee. We'll be coming back for years to come.</Review>

<review>The resort itself was pretty, but the cost was wayyy too much for a day ticket bought day-of at the resort. The price was about $180 for just the ski ticket for a single day, plus another $50 for the ski, boot, and pole rental.

The quality of the rentals was excellent. The process for getting them was great too.

I ended up getting a two hour pass, from 2-4pm, for $80, which was already a lot of money. That is the price of a day ticket at other resorts. All in all, not worth the price.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Review>I've been here a few times now, and the resort and staff are great, but there's never any snow in Tahoe, so I would give the whole lake a one or 0 for skiing.  Can't fault Squaw for Mother Nature, but you'd never believe they actually held a WINTER Olympics there!< /Review>< Pics>

<Name>JEREMY MARSHALL< /Name><review>We go in the off season when room rates are really cheap. Although Squaw Valley Resort never fails to impress no matter what time of year we go. Always friendly and eager to serve.  There isn't a time of year when it's not absolutely beautiful here. Excellent restaurants and only 10 minutes from beautiful Lake Tahoe and Truckee. If you want to experience the Sierra's and have access to some of the most beautiful scenery in the world,  you have to stay here.</review><GmapID>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f< /GmapID>< user>

Lots of amazing terrain! Cool experience for beginners as there is lots of green terrain accessible by the upper lifts.  Beware of the easiest way down can act like a funnel and get very busy and icey towards the bottom.  Single day lift tickets are also extremely expensive.< /Review>

<Review>The mountain looked beautiful and been planning on coming with a couple of friends for a while, because we heard good reviews about Squaw valley. Called the same day to ask if they had any military deals, and they said they did and we would be able to get it. After a 3 hour drive, we get there and they failed to mention one critical piece of information. That it doesn't work on holidays. So after the whole drive we had to pack our stuff and leave, we didn't have enough time to go to another mountain, so the whole day was wasted. Disappointing, and I'm not blaming the front desk lady for turning us down, because that's the rules, just hope for the next people that call Squaw valley resort, they will mention that one little but very important information.< /Review>< GmapID>

Good-looking resort. The people here were extremely helpful. My mom got stuck near a cliff area, and the ski patrol quickly acted when I told them the problem. They even took pictures of my mom for her. Quick, extremely helpful ski patrol really made my trip as awesome as the amazing skiing and weather< /text>

< review>
Great place. The mountain was pretty cool. I came because I have the ikon pass and squaw falls under it. The runs were pretty cool but the biggest problem I had was that people (not the people that worked there) were really really rude! They have signs everywhere to stay "15 feet in distance" from each other, but it was far from it. I was nearly run over several times.

Its not too far away from san Francisco, just 3 hours drive. This is really my favorite place for ski.

I have been waiting many years to go on a tram... especially this one I was not let down The guides were great and capable of answering all my questions The ride was very smooth and the view was spectacular Too bad I was not here when the weather was a little warmer Would have loved to soak in the hot tub.
These guys are awesome. They worked with me and my family well. We were able to get great service quickly so we could get on our way to a great day of skiing.
Convenient location, great selection and the best prices in  Lake Tahoe. WOW I strongly recommend this great place in CA< /review>

What a great little resort. They throw some cool parties and events here, and their lines aren't that long at all. During the spring and summer they have some cool things going on too. Make sure you check out some things in Truckee because they will send you here to have a fun day of drinking and maybe some sunny skiing/boarding.</review>

<Text>I didn't get a normal experience at Squaw, but I can say that their safety and ski patrol is very solid. In a
related topic, many of my friends regard Squaw to be amongst the best of resorts for good slopes.

I've attached a picture of myself getting tobogganed down a hill after my fall, which unfortunately cost me an ACL tear.

Finding that I was unable to walk after a fall, I flagged down a ski instructor, who called for ski patrol. Within 5 minutes, an officer of ski patrol came down to access what had happened and had another member bring the sled within the 5.

They were very professional and well mannered about my injury. Big shout out to Sarah and her father for shuttling me down! I made a bad mistake, but they helped me make the best of it.</Text>< Name>

<Review>Squaw valley is such a beautiful place both in summer and winter. I really enjoy this place, they have nice caring and loving staff so that's a must that they accomplish. They have decent hotel rooms. I love how there's a little shopping square within the village as with food and the bars. So that way you don't have to go anywhere else besides just in the village with all that provided. My opinion probably the best place to ski and snowboard🙂< /Review>< Rating>

Slow lifts compare to the alps. A powder day is tracked out in 2 hours! Even if you buy a ticket in advance it's not worth the ticket price.
Compare with St Anton, Grinderwald, Åre, Niseko, Riksgränden. Cool place Lake Tahoe. It's worth a visit for the nature. Would go back to the Lake Tahoe for some hiking.<//Review><Date>1573427869619</Date>< Name>

It was very quiet at Squaw Valley when we visited. It was not the height of ski season and it was not the middle of summer. Early October was a fantastic time to explore Squaw Valley and the magnificent surrounding area. We loved it. And we would return in an instant. So much to do. So much to see.<//Review>

<pics>None</pics><Rate>1<//Rate><review>Went on one of the best snow days of the year with the whole family.  After spending about $900 on lift tickets and ski rentals, got to top of first run and Squaw shuts down 99% of the lifts claiming too windy.

It was a little windy, but after an hour it was blue skies and they still kept all lifts closed except for one or two and lift lines were 45 minutes.  A friend called me from top of a run he hiked up to (because lifts were closed) and said it wasn't windy at all.  They kept only 2 lifts open the rest of the day and the crowds/lines were unbearable.

The previous day we didn't go because we watched the online lift reports and saw the same thing happened.  It was windy that day, but not bad.  The day we went it was nice but still they kept lifts closed.

No refunds were given either day.  After spending $500 for cabin, $900 for skis, and gas to drive up I won't be going back there again.

I've been told by long time Squaw locals that the management isn't running their finances well and that this was likely a cost cutting attempt to avoid having to pay lift ops and electricity.  They won't be renewing their season  passes next year.<//review>< gmapID>

<review>Love it, always one of the best places to snowboard or ski in the tahoe area. I come back time after time with friends and by myself. Great terrain. Good areas for kids. Excellent views. Most skiable terrain in the Tahoe area<//review>< Pics>

<rating>5</rating><review>Absolutely the nicest employees and the public areas of the resort were lovely.  All of us totally enjoyed ourselves.  We will return!  Our suite wasn't ready on time but we weren't upset.  Still we were treated as though it was an egregious error.  We accepted the apologies but still the resort tried to make it up to us. (How nice!) Wow!  Two flaws:. 1) Rude bellhop who wanted a larger tip (my sons were happy to take our luggage up but not allowed) and 2) suite needed to be refreshed.  The decor was early 80's with a number of stains and holes in fabric plus the "kitchen" didn't have an oven or freezer.< /review>< pics>

<Review>Normal pricing for a single day lift ticket is $180.  This is crazy. Yes, you can buy a season pass or find discounted tickets ahead of time but if you live locally/NorCal and just want to ski for a day you need to be either rich or sell an organ. This sadly has become the reality for many California ski resorts.
When you walk into the rental shop they don’t even have prices posted, they just assume people bend over and whip out a credit card. The good old days where everyone could afford to ski with their family are over.</Review>< Time>

Only reason it's not 5 stars is because two hot dogs with chili on them is $28. Ridiculously expensive to eat, but that's expected I guess. Other than that, wonderful ski resort. Beautiful. Nice new buildings. Rentals are high quality. Friendly staff. And it would take days to ski every run.</Text>

That means that we can offer beginner skiers stunning views of Lake Tahoe while they are learning a new sport. Mountain Run, the three-mile blue run that goes down to the base, is a good goal for skiers and riders as they progress to intermediate levels and beyond. Alpine Meadows offers beginner terrain at the base of the mountain and is also a great place for new skiers and riders to learn. Thank you for your review. We hope to see you on the slopes again soon!"}< /response><Name>Joy< /Name><Time>1549588622798<//Time><Gmap_id>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f< /Gmap_id><Text>A bit pricey, but really huge and amazing ski resort. One thing, though, if you don't know a bit of skiing already, this may not be the best place to learn. All the green slopes are at the top, and there's not an easy way to get all the way down the mountain. So you need to take the lifts and tram back. I wish they would make a green route all the way down.

If you can handle blue, then it's great, and lots of more challenging runs for the experts. If it's your first time skiing, maybe learn somewhere smaller first and then come here once you're confident stopping and turning.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

A 2 hour drive from Davis.  Great hills and lifts.  Nice village and lodge options.  Pricey (as ski resorts often are), with discount ticket purchases occasionally on website or advertised during Spring Season.  Children's ski school available.</review>

I liked how big squaw valley was and that it had 2 ski/snowboard parks (advanced and beginner). The runs of of Granite Chief and Shirley are quite fun as well. I have not explored the bottom runs of squaw yet and only use Mountain Run, Sunnyside, and Home Run to get down from the top. Some things to improve upon is a skiing or snowboarding connection between Alpine and Squaw so that you could ski or snowboard between the two since they are partners and more parking space that is not obstructed by the snow (like a closed parking building).< /Review>

The lodge is a little dated, but the lower price more than makes up for that. The rooms are clean, no problems there. If you plan to ski all day and mostly sleep and eat here, it's perfect. The spa is a great way to end a long ski day.<//Review></record>

Top notch ski. Lots of terrain. More expensive than the rest of the resorts in the area. Watch out for closures of upper mountain when windy. Shirley lift on the back side is a good trade off for blue-black slopes with easier lines.<//review>

I've both skied at Squaw and attended Wanderlust in the summer. It's stunning at both times of year. The skiing is really good and I enjoyed the vastness of the park. In the summer, I enjoyed the hiking and the high camp pool area. The gondola to high camp is fast and large.< /text>

<Review>Bought a 2017 season pass. This is the most amateur resort I've encountered. They are consistently closed or blocking mountain access. I have never been to a resort who is closed more on a weekend. Just drive the extra 8hrs to Salt Lake City and get better resorts, snow, and much cheaper than the $159 for Squaw.</Review>< pics>

Squaw is a love/hate relationship. The mountain itself and its village are certainly the best in Tahoe. Squaw is truly a world class mountain. The problem is that most of the time, a majority of the mountain is closed to public. If you decide to go, understand you may not be able to ski what you want.< /text>

Not as expected, runs are shorter that expected and runs could get crowded easily.

Youll be constantly looking out for people. Its interesting that they would have beginners runs in the middle of the mountain funneling everyone on the same road/runs.

Should a lift operator have the right to put there finger on you? Yeah!!! It happened and unfortunately for me I own a season pass with here.

Lift operator are very demanding and with no smile on there face... Theve forgotten that they are in existence BECAUSE OF US THE COSTUMERS.</Text>

< review>
While the skiing here can be great, the early season is terrible and they offer no discounts for early season.  We paid full price for 20% of the lifts open.  Additionally, the majority of the runs during December are in the shade and completely icy.  The staff seems preoccupied with catching up with their friends and smoking weed- there are exceptions, but the majority are immature and don't treat it like a job.  All in all the worst ski experience I've had in 30 years of skiing (including Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Europe, and even back east in Massachusetts and Vermont.  I waited 2 months to post this, but after an awesome day at Bear Mountain of all places, with peaks at only 8,500, I just realized I paid twice as much for Squaw, for only half the experience.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><review>Was here the last week in July 2015, with my wife and 13 year old daughter. We loved it!! The 1 bedroom condo was huge and clean and beautiful decorated in rustic mountain style. The kitchen was well stocked. The village area was great, a very casual and mellow atmosphere. We ate at two restaurants in the village, a Irish Pub and Fireside Pizza, both were excellent. The pizza place had live entertainment on the outside deck. We enjoyed the campfires placed around the village, and also saw a evening movie playing outdoors. Personally as the Dad on the trip, I appreciated the front desk help when asking about good places to hike and swim. The girl at the desk was patient and wrote down all the best hiking trails on a map, and her favorite beach. We did most of them, and every one was a jem! After our 4 nights stay, both my wife & daughter complimented me on choosing the Squaw Valley Resort. So, right there, a winner.

If we return to Tahoe, which is very likely as it's the most beautiful place on Earth. We will be back at Squaw Valley.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Squaw Valley is one of my favorite resorts within the Tahoe/Reno area.  Within the ten years of snowboarding,  I've been to all the resorts and still find myself visiting Squaw Valley at least once every season.  There are many qualities makes Squaw outshine all the others. I'll highlight my main reasons:

1. Everyone is friendly - from the staffs at the parking lot to the staffs high above the mountain.

2. Diverse staffs - not many people will pay attention to this,  but I do as I have older parents who are actively working bc aren't ready for retirement.  I appreciate the fact that Squaw doesn't discriminate; age, gender,  race,  etc.  You can connect with any staffs there bc of it.

3. Clean - I'm not sure about the men's restrooms, but the women's are clean.  They also have complimentary feminine products.

4. Price - if you buy your ticket online early,  you'll save at least $40. We bought ours online for $129; on day of, it was $169. The online purchase do not have expiration date and you can use them individually.

Overall,  those are my main reasons for supporting and coming back to Squaw Valley besides their multiple runs for different level - beginners to experts.<//text>

I know it's a winter resort, but if you're going to rent it in the summer, you need real AC. Their alternative is a very noisy portable unit in the family room that vents onto the patio (which makes that area hard to use due to the hot exhaust), with box fans to blow cool air into the bedrooms. I thought it was a joke until I called the front desk. Our room was 85 degrees when we checked in for those who think it doesn't get that hot. Resort overall is nice, great amenities, lots of dining options, super friendly staff.< /review>< UserId.>

Fun place to hangout for a weekend. They do fireworks on Saturday evenings. The skiing is great, except that all the green runs are near the top. When conditions are windy, the lifts that take you up are the first to close. 😑< /text>

I wanted to surprise my daughter and her husband with something special when they arrived at resort. I contacted the Concierge Kate to make my request. I was amazed at the great information and assistance I received. I have never received such great customer service! From the moment they answered the phone until I made my request I was treated with such courtesy and kindness. Thank you so very much for helping me make my kid’s vacation just a little more special. Thank you Kate!< /review>

<user_name>Marc G< /user_name><Review>Squaw still ranks as my favorite general focus, all-mountain mountain in California. It's got a ton of terrain, plenty of snow, great access to fast lifts and gondolas, and a proper resort feel for apres-ski. No wonder squaw has hosted seminal moments in NA skiing history with events like the '60s Olympics and many actual olympiads. Add the growing collaboration with neighboring Alpine Meadows, and you have thousands of acres of exciting snow playground. Not to mention that Squaw keeps it's lift and season passes more affordable then the competing Northstar resort.

<Text>Squaw is a terrific experience for service and value. The kids ski school is just terrific--super supportive and patient. Everyone consistently makes us feel welcome and valued as customers, and the overall value is strong.

The company is investing heavily and creatively in development partnerships to solve parking, transit and other area problems in sustainable ways, and the management team is really knocking it out of the park in operations and communications to customers this year, despite enormous challenges from record snowfall.<//Text>< Pics>

Squaw is hands down the best skiers resort in the USA. It’s still just a little rough around the edges, and yet refined. The skiing varies from the extreme, which made it famous, to the green groomers that make it a good fit for families.<//Review>

<Text>Staff is friendly and helpful. Runs are long and pleantiful. Powder is on the far right usually. Grooves are freshly created and well kept. Snow park is pretty awesome. The Olympic Museum nastalgic and the outdoor ice skating rink. Definetly a place to visit car pool if you can, or stay for the weekend the Snow Village is fresh and breath taking.</Text>< date>

It's a nice resort, good food options, lots of runs and helpful staff.  Great place to snowboard. Especially if you are lucky enough to catch some powder off Broken Arrow.

Easy rental options and demo shops for those without their own equipment.

Expect to pay $12 for a cocktail. Roughly $12 for lunch. The lower food options are better than what you'll find in the upper mountain.

Great place for the family.< /text>< UserId.>

The hotel was very clean. The room was perfect. Sarah at the desk as well as all the staff just awesome. 2 complaints. Charged an additional 25 bucks for a resort fee upon checkout. Not happy. Also a bottle of water and a very small chocolate milk was 9 bucks. Pretty overpriced.
View was spectacular.</text>

Great terrain! Good ski/snowboard programs. Decent restaurants and non-ski options in the village, but it's lags behind Northstar. Overall, our family's go-to resort in the Tahoe area.<//review>

<UserId.>104539715813332020581< /UserId.><rate>4< /rate><text>The skiing here can be phenomenal.  Variety of terrain, elevation, snow - it's all here.  The price for such extravagance is that Squaw attracts a huge crowd.  The parking lot is huge, and it fills up, spilling over onto the access road.  On my most recent visit, the lines were long even for a Sunday (7-12 minutes, which is long for this day and age) and here at Squaw, they generally leave it to the skiers to self-regulate the lines, which *most* people do.  After all these years, I am surprised they still do not have a shuttle to get people across the treacherously icy parking lot.  Know what you are getting yourself into, and you will have a great time here!<//text>< Date>

It is in a great location close to Tahoe City. It's clean and visually pleasing. Our kids were excited about the water slide in the heated pool. I'm not sure what the actual temp of the pools were heated too, but it was still VERY cold. The kids couldn't stay in it very long. When Lake Tahoe's water is warmer than the pool, I wouldn't really consider those heated.
My biggest complaint which rendered my rating of three stars was the AC in the room. They have mattress covers on all the mattress that prevents them from breathing. We would turn our AC down as low as it would let us, and we would still wake up burning up. We called almost every day complaining. They offered to move us, but I went to that room first to see if it was any cooler and it wasn't. The hallways always felt amazing! I was tempted to pull my bed out there. We would lower the thermostat every night to the lowest it would go and when we woke up burning up it would be 4 degrees higher.
We just called down again to tell them the thermostat is changing from where we are setting it. A guy came into the room to look at it and advised us that these systems were just recently changed to new systems and the thermostats reset after 6-8 hrs. So, I told him when I wake up burning up its because the thermostat is changing 4 degrees higher. He pretty much was like yeah that's what it does. He said the old systems were worst, and it took them 5 yrs to finally get them replaced....as if this made me feel better about burning up at night. It is not worth any amount of money to me if I can not get a good nights sleep because I'm burning up!!!! Another weird design is that they have the air vent on the wall right next to the huge curtained window. Most Hotel rooms have them on the wall to where the air goes towards the beds where you actually sleep! Whoever designed this format was not feasibly thinking of sleeping in the room! We LOVE Lake Tahoe, but I'm ready to get a good nights sleep!<//text>

<Text>Way too expensive for what it is. I really enjoyed it 10y ago when a day pass cost $65; went up 8-10 times a season. Not worth double the price though. The last few years I haven't spent a single dollar in Tahoe but prefer to go to Utah or Europe (if I have more time).<//Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
A steeper and larger ski resort on Lake Tahoe, Squaw offers a mixture of chair, gondola, and tram access to the snow. With several harder terrain options, many prefer Squaw for it's difficulty. Others prefer the abundance of high speed chairs, moderate terrain, and village atmosphere.< /Review>

<Name>Francesca Pepoon<//Name><Text>One of our favorite Tahoe ski resorts for its diverse terrain, excellent snow grooming, and best-in-class ski patrol. For intermediate and advanced skiers, there is a wide selection of groomed and open bowl skiing, especially if you include Alpine Meadows as part of Squaw Valley. What makes it such a great experience, though, is the active presence of ski patrol ensuring skiers and snowboarders are in control and safe. Unlike places like Northstar, it's far less likely you'll be hit from behind or run over by idiots who just want to see how fast they can go before they crash.

The village is lovely and has everything you need for a day, week, or season of winter fun.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Disappointing first time stay, we were told we would be getting a one bedroom suite, however we got a normal room which didn’t work since there were 2 couples. TV channels didn’t work most of the day. Worst part was the snow plows/heavy machinery going on all night long outside our room. We slept very little both nights due to this. Lastly and most disappointing was the fact they wouldn’t let us check out late, despite all the highways being closed and we literallly had nowhere to go. Definitely would not come back. I will say the heated underground parking is nice, and the rest of the village is great.</Review><gmapID>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f<//gmapID><user_id>113230373007320352457< /user_id>< resp>

<text>Buyer BEWARE.  Never pre-purchase your lift tickets for Squaw Valley. I am out of pocket $600 because the 395 was closed and we could not get to the resort. While on our way, we had to stop in Mammoth and turn around.  We begged the resort to refund us and they would not. THey offered a "ski cheque" requiring us to go back again before this season ends.  It was a one time opportunity for us.  I will never go to Squaw nor will recommend it to anyone.  I am certain there are others out there who have experienced the same disappointment as us.</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>Loved it. Still lots of snow over spring break. Restaurant was closed at High Camp so we hit the mini-mart there. Extremely overpriced. 3 sandwiches and 2 salads in boxes like the ones from 7-eleven costed $81! Only one sandwich option and it had so much olives kids didn't really eat them.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

The skiing is amazing here. Along with all the restaurants and ski gear shops. It does get a bit crowded and try and find somewhere cheaper to stay.  The hotel can get pricy.  Big bonus for military is the super cheap annual ski pass. I only paid $50 for the year!</Review>

<review>There is a lot to ski. A lot of different terrain to from easier greens to some hard blacks. We spent two days here and still didn't see everything. For more advanced skiers I recommend Granite and Silverado.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Used to be a great resort, now wind holds poor staffing and over sold passes have created a bay area type experience of bottle necks, traffic jams, and dangerous work environments for employees. When skiing other resorts it is the most common conversation how Squaw Valley has taken a turn for the worse.  It's a bummer, such great terrain and an amazing legacy.< /Review>< Resp>

Some of the most varied terrain around, especially since they connected with Alpine.  Granite Chief is my favorite area to ski.  Just hope the snow conditions improve. Good thing the Olympics were not held in Tahoe this year.<//Text>

A great ski resort! Good trails and good snow. The upper trails are good for late in the season.< /review>

<Review>The setting and atmosphere are some of the best in the Tahoe area. There are many shops and trails to explore and the sceneries are outstanding.

<Review>That place has ridiculous prices. $180/day for ski lift, $40 for 15 min kid snowmobiles in anemic setting? Give me a break. No wonder there no usual crowd on the mountain this Christmas. As i learned they changed ownership - that explains it. Keep going, sooner you go bankrupt, sooner things will change for better greedy guys.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I would give it 5 stars if management wasn't trying to destroy everything great about Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows. Best terrain in the Tahoe Basin run by the most evil and environmentally destructive ski corporation in the lower 48.<//Review>

My husband won a package through Squaw Valley that included 1yr lease of a Toyota Highlander, new skis with boots, ski clothes and a ski pass for the two of us for the 2017/2018 ski noise. My husband tried to contact them several times and they were always going to get back to him. Needless to say we did get the Toyota for a yr and the skis but nothing else. So the next time you enter a drawing and by chance your name is drawn you may NOT get what they said you won.  So disappointed because I have never skied and was looking forward to learning. 😕< /text>

<review>Either pay $100 or so there or $97 for 12:30 time in. I highly suggest to buy it online for a slight bit more discount so your time would be more worth it.
Taking the gondolas up you will be able to start your adventures. There were tons of different lifts going to different part of the mountains. Sadly though there were some very FLAT areas which is very difficult for boarders so gotta learn to shimmy your body or if your new, just take off them bindings!

Lift tickets may cost over an arm and leg but the runs are quite long, but watch out for your last run around 4pm ...There is tons and tons of moguls so watch out for them and skiers!<//review><UserId.>100944996559980288840< /UserId.>< Pictures>

Definitely a full service resort with a huge selection of everything for every level of skier.  Beware that they tend to rate the slopes less difficult than they actually are so beginners should stick to the green runs around high camp.  Literally everything here is stupendously expensive though.</review>

Parallel Mountain Sports in the Village next to the Tram building is tops for buying your skis and boots.  Connor was extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  They also mounted my bindings and I'm ready to go.  Let's hope for a great winter because I'm good to go.< /Text>

The pictures of the rooms do not resemble the rooms at all.  We booked a 1 bedroom suite for our honeymoon based on the pictures that looked really nice, but when we got to our room, we were less than romanced.  Very little storage for your stuff.  The unit is overall well equipped, but very cramped.</review>

Hit a full day after the hectic monster lines on a Saturday after the first big dump of the winter. What is there bad to say about this place minus the price. If you can afford this place its gorgeous, massive, has it all from shops to lodging, eating, valet, etc. As for the mountain itself, tons of lifts (all are usually not open) and some of the best views I've ever seen in my life. Good avi control here so be sure to hit that headwall lift hard.<//review>

My initial impressions were marred because at first I thought this was a skiier's resort, and damn, there are soooo many of them. But then as I became more educated I learned Jeremy Jones is here, and during good snow years a lot of the top snowboarders train here. The only thing that makes Tahoe stand out among other places in the USA is its snowboarders, and the awesome beauty of watching their creativity when you go ride. Squaw is great, but Alpine Meadows is even better, and it suffers the usual ills that plague Tahoe ski resorts: anti-density and NIMBY car driving wealthy homeowners block any sensible construction of middle class hotels, so they lose a lot of great vibes and there's way too much time spent driving in a parking lot unless you're super wealthy. There are no hostels here, but there are no hostels on any resorts in Tahoe, and on the plus side they offer a TART bus. There's just not as good a vibe when a place is stuffed with wealthy ski families and there are no options for single or working class people. Food is standard ski food, although the village is getting better, and it would be really cool to have banh mi and poke and French cheese and delicious baguettes and Indian rotis. The swimming pool is actually pretty fun and not cheesy at all, and man! during good years it's just so fun to watch the best snowboarders ride.<//Review>

I really enjoy skiing at squaw but I have two specific complaints. The first is probably just opinion but I feel like they close or put lifts on hold too easily, I always go during the week so it is probably more economical for them to do so. The second complaint is lift ticket prices, I have a pass so this isn't a problem but when I want to go with friends or family who do not it is very expensive. Even online ticket prices are significantly more than the vail resorts, arguably smaller but still. I doubt prices will ever decrease but I feel the need to voice this complaint. For evidence I payed $87 at Kirkwood this Tuesday while my brother payed $160 at squaw today, Wednesday. Squaw pass purchased online Kirkwood at the window. For accuracy I was able to get a discount for ski with a friend on rhe epic local pass but still.</text>

Swanky crowd and big open basins for skiing.  Does not have a community feel nor a forest-y feel.  Lots of runs and options for getting down the mountain. Food options ample and expensive.< /text>

<review>Here is the deal with this place.  If you can take two weeks off and stay there, you'll be golden.  If you can go on a whim and find a place to stay on short notice or just drive back at the end of the day, that would work

But, if like most people, you can manage 3-4 long weekends in a season that you need to book at least a month of more in advance, and IF there is a storm that hits when you are there, you will be in Reno pulling slots.  Here is how it breaks down:

Storm starts, too warm - raining and windy. A few lower lifts may be open, but don't count on it.
Begins to cool, starts snowing - lifts closed due to wind
Snow finally abates - lifts closed due to avalanche danger, check back at noon, then check back at 1PM.  Lifts close at 4 so basically, they don't open.

Look, I get it, skiing is a sport that DEPENDS on bad weather.  Unfortunately, this resort is unable to operate (or unwilling to) unless the conditions are PERFECT.  I also understand the corporatification of skiing and that the location of Squaw puts it into a very strong wind channel.  But, over the years, this resort has been getting more and more conservative to the point where a season pass is just not worth it any more.</review><gmapID>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f< /gmapID><date>1457219222433< /date>< user>

Overall a mediocre skiing experience. Only good during record breaking snow year due to low base altitude. Decent verical although only about 1000 ft. of its 2800 has decent snow. The overall consensus I keep hearing is " best mountain at Tahoe" . I can think of more than 25 resorts in the states that dominate the Lake Tahoe area and I have skiied them all over and over. If you like steeps and deep with great snow try Jackson Hole or any Resort in Utah or if in California try Mammoth a much better Sierra experience!</review>

Instead kf having a pass dangling from your pants all day, they have key cards that scan theough your gear so it can stay in your pocket all day.
It has a great village if you're not into skiing, and some great dining options.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Majestic in its own right, as with all the Tahoe-area resorts. The village is lively with apres-types in the late afternoon, and the mountain itself provides a great experience especially for the intermediate types.</Review><user_id>109013198219258180078< /user_id><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Long time passholder at Squaw & Kirkwood.  Squaw is an amazing mountain with unbelievable terrain, a legendary culture and some of the best local skiiers and riders in the world, including winter sports pioneers such as Shane McConkey, Jeremy Jones,  the MatchStick Productions crew, more Olympians than you can shake a stick at, and many, many others.  This is also one of the best spring skiing destinations on the planet. There are, however, some downsides: 1) squaw has become oppressively expensive in all dimensions.  A season pass is absolutely required if you want to ski there more than a few days a year- ticket window prices are now >$160, and forget about having someone lean to ski there- you are in for >$300/day- not conducive to bringing friends into the sport.  2) Squaw has been hit by climate change- it is increasingly frequent for squaw to get rain on its base, and (if we're lucky) snow on top.  3) the mountain is huge, which is amazing, but also means that some favorite (but less popular) lifts run very infrequently.  4) on the weekends or powder days, expect crowds, lots of crowds.  once the whole mountain opens, people disperse, but until then, expect to put in some line time.  On the plus side, if you put up with all of the above, you get to ski or ride squaw with some of the best winter athletes on the planet, and with terrain to test you at any ability level.  A final note, people can get agressive on line on a powder day.  Don't take it personally, they want to be in the snow and don't have patience for you not having your act together in front of them.  focus on the snow and it will all be okay...  This is a place for people who deeply love to ski and ride.  enjoy!< /Review>

I have mixed feelings about this mountain. I found one particular run that I enjoyed the most and ended up coming back to. Some runs were closed for a race, some due to low visibility.. overall despite it being a huge mountain, it gets super crowded. It took us over 45 minutes just to pick up our lift tickets on a Friday.
Beautiful views on top.. the kind that makes you want to wait before riding down.
Like many ski resorts , great cozy downtown area</review>

Got food poisoning from the cantina, floors were dirty, room service didn't even have a vacuum for daily cleaning, got stuck with no power and they told us roads were too bad to leave then people showed up to check in and said roads were fine. Would not comp a room or offer free night for no power.  Staff lied about not having a generator because they didn't want people to be mad because it broke down.  I have never been lied to so many times at one place.  Probably won't come back.</Review>

<Review>My husband and mother-in-law skiied, my father-in-law and I took in the amazingly beautiful views, walked around the village, enjoyed the gondola and tram...and relaxed on the deck watching all of the snow boarders and skiiers! We had a great time and the skiiers loved it!  Expensive for someone who doesn't ski often but I'm sure all ski resorts are.  Super friendly staff, great place!</Review>< Pictures>

Excellent ski resort. The place is huge with lots of terrain. The prices have increased way too much over the last few years though. If you're a beginner I'd suggest going somewhere cheaper.< /text>

This golf course is truly amazing,the way it playes between the meadow the creek and the  mountain. The service is AWESOME, everyone from the Sandy's Pub to the Pro Shop, Michael Mc Ityre the starter will take care of anything that you need . He took care of the group in front of us I was so impressed with the way he keep everything running smoothly. The pace of play is never over 4 hrs. I usually play  in three hours and it happens at Squaw Creek. The lessons are very good they have an Exceptional teacher John who has an amazing knowledge of the game. The pro shop has so much COOL stuff for a golf shop. WELL DONE< /Review>

guess they dont know ‘squaw’ is a derogatory term for native women.
this place may be ‘legendary,’ but its grossly overpriced and overrun by the ‘elite.’

Good facilities, helpful staff, good selection tion of ski runs, quiet during mon-wed.  Thursday-Sunday more locals turn up and gets busier.  2018 season snow was at a premium and unusually warm afternoons meant slushy runs heading back to the village wasn't much fun.<//text>

Squaw SUCKS!  Wish zero stars was an option.  It's an over-priced, over-rated has-been mountain.  They routinely lie about snow levels and lifts in operation.  It used to be a skiers mountain and now it's a flat-lander-kook destination.  Unlike the old ownership, the new ownership doesn't care about the ski experience they only care about fleecing suckers and closing as many lifts as they can due to 'wind-hold'.  Don't bother, there are plenty of other great options.< /Text>

<text>On one of the nicest ski days of the season, the lifts had many mechanical problems.  The tram was closed (for more than just one day).  One lift was inoperable when the area opened.  Other lifts were in and out of service during the day.  It was a bit frustrating to be standing in line with little idea of when the out would be running again -- or, worse yet, stuck on a chairlift while the mechanics were at work.  One suspects that, because there were so many mechanical issues, this is a chronic situation due to substandard maintenance, rather than just an isolated bad day.<//text><Name>Chuck Nordhoff< /Name><Rate>3</Rate><Response>None<//Response>< Pics>

<Text>Squaw Valley is almost too big for KSL to manage on stormy days.  Safety is always first, and delayed lift openings ensure avalanche controls are taken and skier/riders get fresh tracks as upper mountain sections open as the day progresses.  Best bets on fresh snow days are KT-22 on the lower mountain, Broken Arrow in mid-mountain, and usually Solitude/Shirley to Granite around mid-day.  If not windy, then head up the Siberia Express and Headwall Express for colder and drier conditions at North Bowl and The Slot.  And when the Emigrant lift is fixed ski/ride the Funnel into Shirley Lake.  A lot of Upper Mountain terrain is hard to open due to buried lifts; however, it is worth the wait.<//Text></record>

<Text>Awesome ski/snowboard experience! Parking was easy and close to the mountain which allowed us to leave our lunches in our car (and not pay money to rent a locker). Renting snowboard and boot was very professional. They had a whole assembly line going which removed the confusion of who was going to help you. Fast forward to the end of the day and returning your equipment was very easy! :)

We had a few beginners in our group but it was awesome that the green runs were not just at the bottom of the mountain. We were pleasantly surprised to find a whole green run oasis at the top of the Tram. This allowed our group to split up but not have to worry about taking a long time getting back to each other.

Definitely will come back here again :)< /Text>< Pictures>

Best run mountain in the Tahoe basin.  Great lift coverage, great snowmaking and guest services.  Wish the lift tickets were a little cheaper. I  feel like I need a loan every time I ski.</Text>

<Review>This place is huge. I've taken classes and they were a great experience. Staff is friendly and the runs are long. Long runs are a definite plus and the village has alot of different foods.</Review>< pics>

<Review>The runs and snow were great.
For a first time there, they were terrible at directing us where to go to get tickets and hire equipment. We ended up queueing in the wrong shop (the inn ski shop), not squaw valley, before getting turned away. Then they gave us the wrong voucher to get ski clothes and had to call someone to switch the voucher out.
They don't rent jackets, and quickly run out of ski pants.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I'm a retired vet that drove 2 1/2 hours only to be told that my 20 years of service wasn't enough to get the military special only to follow it up with them kicking us off the mountain because "snowskates are a liability" even after signing a waiver. And FYI, the skates are flat like skis and are the same length as kid skiis. Sounds like they just hate vets to me. Just found a resort I'll never visit again. We give them 👎👎👎👎< /Text></record>

Loved the Tram ride and the Olympic village view from the peak which is at 9050ft .. The peaking view of Lake Tahoe was an added bonus.
Worth paying $46/ticket & you can ride as many times you'd like before it closes for the day.< /review>

< Review>
To be honest, some of the reviews of Squaw are not so hot, so I tried to keep my expectations in check. This was my wife and I's first trip to Squaw, let alone any ski area outside of the east coast. We had an absolute blast! Conditions were as good as they could be for being somewhat warm, the views and atmosphere are astounding. Traffic and parking was no problem at all because we made sure to get there an hour early to prep and catch first chair.

Some other's were upset that they weren't opening the lifts early, but it was no big deal, we were just happy to be in the mountains. Crowds were none existent for the first hour, then they set in and the longest wait was maybe 10 min, but later in the day the Funitel had no line so you could just ski right up to it.

The day was going great until I decided to do one last run while my wife rested, so I decided to take a whack at Lower Dog Leg, bad decision. Black diamonds are a little different here than on the east coast. Wound up taking a hell of a fall and breaking two bones in my leg, gear flying everywhere. Once the snow settled, a snowboarder stopped, helped me gather my gear and alert ski patrol. Took a ride down the mountain on a sled to their urgent care. Got x-rays taken, confirmed things were not great, got an air cast, crutches, and pain meds. So out trip had to end early.

That being said, everyone we interacted with on the mountain was great, employees were all pleasant, happy, smiling. Made for a great experience. Ski patrol was absolutely top notch, got me out of a hairy situation quickly and safely, did an absolute great job.

We will be back without a doubt!!<//Review>

I just got there 29/11/2017.
Snow is very good. Not too much crowded. I rided a tram(Gondola) for 46$ per person, its so amazing and good value. Don't have to wait because there are just a few passenger. Tram takes about 10 minutes riding and approches every 20 minutes. Tram ticket can ride small tram called Funitel with unlimited. All closes about 15:30 for the last passenger who wanna go up. The upper site have a station but buffet and Olympic museum are closed for construction but it's still great with café, terrace and ski school for beginner. The base floor is also good, nice architecture. Scenic view on the way to the resort is nice. I believe that you will love it like me.
PS. Sunset at 16:00</Review>

This place needs no introduction. Make sure you whack the poles before sending it.

<Date>1487103404182</Date><rating>1<//rating><Review>This is one of  the most poorly managed resorts I've ever skied at.  They can't get anything with pitch open, and proximity to SF means massive lines on the lower mountain (the only open areas). They stated wind hold today and Ave danger on a day with 0 wind and every other Tahoe resort was fully open. If there is av danger four days after the last storm it's because you haven't done your job yet.

Tons and tons of intermediates everywhere. Poorly maintained, badly managed, and an extremely sour vibe at the resort from all the  locals that feel their seasons were stolen by this crap management Co. This place badly needs a change in ownership.  Have skied all over the world, will never, ever return.<//Review>< pics>

<date>1539901972968</date><Rate>2< /Rate><text>Good challenging terrain for expert skiers. Ownership sucks and mountain operations are terrible. Lifts like Broken Arrow and Olympic Lady almost never run. I've been skiing here for 35 years and mountain operations use to be quite good. New ownership (KSL) frequently stops or doesn't open lifts to save money. They are often short staffed. Lift lines, parking, traffic to get to the mountain are all horrible! We have nicknamed the KSL ownership "Keep Stopping Lifts" or "Keep Standing in Line". Even though they don't limit season pass sales, they won't refund your season pass if you get injured. Instead they have a terrible business practice of requiring customers to buy "insurance" to get any kind of refund if they can't ski. Talk about adding insult to injury! The only thing being insured is the profits of KSL! They are a big corporation that only cares about profits and they lack focus on customer service in what should be an enjoyable experience for all in a recreational venue.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Huge, crowded, pretty expensive tickets. Worth it, if you can find a multi-day deal.< /review>

I went to Squaw Valley last weekend.  Beautiful resort.
I took the beginners group class.  This was my first time ever in ski boots whereas the other's in the group were familiar with the basics.  What I got was a patronizing instructor who spoiled the experience for me. (Asking me sarcastically if I didn't know I could skid on ice or if I was an A-type certainly didn't help.)  The good news was that I got my money back since I cut short my 2-hour class.<//text>

<Name>josh</Name><Review>Interesting to read the reviews of others who had similar experiences.  The resort seemed short staffed and they  closed down lifts frequently during our stay due to "high winds".  When I asked staff why all the upper lifts were closed, I got a insulting response "are you a lift engineer?"

Great terrain but it is very poorly managed.
These guys can't keep lifts running.  Maintanence issues, understaffing,  just poor operational management.
I live in the area and also have a place in Colorado and I can definitively say that the difference in operational management is extremely palpable.  A lot of wasted powder days because these guys don't have their operational services on par with other resorts around the country.  Lines can be hours long due to mismanagement.< /Text>

love this place due to there steep challenging terrain. Wish it still snowed there. Management has there head up there asses. They dream about being a destination resort but do not have the intermediate terrain that the general public desires. Nore do they groom well.Local resort northstar dose this well. They cannot keep lifts running. The management continues to not plan for any problems and they have lots. I have traveled around a lot and every resort I go is run far better.Also the snow pack changes due to the warmth but it is rarely Colorado cold here<//Text>

<review>This review is not about the ski area (which is beautiful) but about the Squaw Kids Ski school.
If you are considering group ski lessons for a beginner child (mine is 6): run away. Run away as fast as you can. Based on my experience this place is light years away from being able (or willing) to teach young kids the joy of skiing.
I enrolled my son in an afternoon group lesson for first time skiers (price in 02/14 is $169 including gear for 2.5h of ski lessons). What my son got for this was:
20 minutes gear fitting
30 minute juice break
Approximately 30-40 minutes sitting around in the snow and about 1h of actual playing in the snow which sums up to two rides on the magic carpet, a little intro to "pizza and French fries" and, well, nothing else. This is it.
Afterwards I talked to a very friendly and professional supervisor who had nothing of any significance to add to this. It appears as if this is very much the experience that is expected. He did mention that it was a very busy day (yes, Presidents' Day weekend is crazy indeed), but from my vantage point this is *his* issue to manage (staff up more, take fewer kids, hire more competent people) but should not make a first day of skiing a "I don't think I want to do this ever again, we were only sitting around" type of experience.
Based on my experience in Washington state this is not typical for kids skiing lessons. Snoqualmie, Crystal Mt both offered much better lessons for the kids (my older son did his first steps on skis there).

So yeah, run, run fast. I hear Northstar offers a more fun environment and less frustration.</review>< userid>

Great ski resort, cheap(er) lift tickets available at Costco.  Easy access to lifts, shuttle bus available for parking, and a great beginner slope.</Text>

I've seen a lot of complaints about the instructors and man oh man, do I agree.  I wasn't someone that paid for the lessons, but I was another person on the mountain.  I almost collided with someone that was being instructed and it was a complete accident.  This person was going straight across in front of me.  I saw him and was moving out of his way as far as possible to the left.  He kept going to the left and although I thought I had enough room to move around him, he continued to move straight across in front of me.  By the time I was closer to him, it was too late to slow down enough to avoid him.  So I started to shout to make sure he saw me, narrowly missed him and our boards touched just a smidge.  I looked behind me to make sure he was okay and that he hadn't fallen.  He hadn't.

However, he was with an instructor that actually was telling this guy to cross like that!  The instructor started yelling at me down the mountain, cursing at me!  It was a clear mishap, but the instructor was not having any of it.  The instructor bombed down the hill and caught up with me when I was taking a rest on the mountain when I found my friends and husband.  I was ready to apologize and tell him that there was no harm meant, but he was extremely condescending, talking to me as if I was some reckless teenager.  "YOU - take your earphones off.  Make sure you can hear me.  That was completely your fault."  At that point, I was angry, "no... I tried to stop and because I couldn't predict where he was going, I was having trouble.  It was an accident."  "No" he says, "that was your fault.  You were not paying attention."  "Yes I was.  I couldn't avoid him, even though I tried."  The person that was being instructed was sheepishly looking on, as if he wanted no part of this.  The instructor clearly wanted me to apologize, but because of the way he approached me and his unwillingness to understand that accidents can happen regardless of how careful one is, I was NOT going to.

I told him I was going to report him.  He said, "go ahead!  Here's my card, I hope you do report me!"

This guy completely ruined my time at Squaw and I'm not willing to go back...especially with so little snow and the ticket prices increasing.  There are far more mountains to choose from than have to deal with this crap.

He's supposed to set a good example on the mountain rather than continue a culture of anger and yelling.  Awesome job guy.  I hope you were a seasonal employee.</text>

Not much going on in the village when I went. Wanted to take the tram up to top but it was closed. They want a lot of money to ride that thing. I suggest looking at Groupon for discounts</text>

< Review>
Home to more Olympic athletes than any other resort I know about and for good reason.  Much to do at 'base-camp' and lot's of advanced terrain.  No rush to head home either, probably the biggest ski apres vibe in all of Tahoe.  Low on cash? Try the general store where you can get a tall cans of Pabst for about $2 and good deli samiches for a few more.< /Review>

This resort gets some bad press from time to time but, rest assured Squaw Valley offers the best spring skiing experience in the country!
From consistant snowpack to highcamp hot tub and bar to apre ski gambling nearby this is what warm weather skiing is all about.
I haven't missed a spring trip since 1981 and I'll see you June 10th weekend!!</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Arguably the best mountain Inn of Lake Tahoe. Other favorites Kirkwoods and Sierra on Powder days. At Squaw Valley you can hang out  next to the fire  after you're done  in the evening  or grab dinner . Northstar is a fun place to go skiing or snowboarding, but it does not have the amount of difficult Terrain that you find at Squaw Valley. Northstar does offer ice skating , music and a series of fire pits all in the central area for hanging out during the day or in the evening after riding , which is the only feature that I prefer over Squaw Valley. Kirkwood and Sierra have a great training but don't have the evening atmosphere.<//Review>< Pictures>

If it's storming then you're screwed and if it's not storming then there's no fresh snow.

I don't know if it's just poorly laid-out (how could a world-class ski resort be so crippled by wind?) or if there is just a lack of staff to get all the jobs done that need to get done to open the mountain on time but it is extremely frustrating to be there during a storm that is dumping snow by the foot that you can't ski on because the lifts won't or can't open on time or at all.

Btw, if you are skiing with beginners (or you yourself are a beginner), you may want to consider another mountain. The big area of green trails at the top of the mountain looks enticing on a trail map, but you can only ski there if the top of the mountain is open (definitely not a given). If the top of the mountain is closed due to wind or storms then there is almost no beginner terrain on the entire mountain.

It's a shame because it is a great mountain with awesome terrain that should be one of the top resorts in the country.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x809bd9ecf08f263d:0x30be88f09785170f<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have to admit, I like Squaw MORE than both Heavenly & Northstar. I think it does the whole "Mega-resort" thing with more understatement then either of the other two. I REALLY ❤ Alpine Meadows (which is also like Kirkwood -- my other medium sized mountain favorite) and the fact that you can ski both Squaw and Alpine both in a day and mix it up is SUPER convenient for the experience. I still prefer Alpine over Squaw because I am a fan of smaller less mega-resort type places, but Squaw I actually do like VERY MUCH. More
than I expected to. This year I opted to not renew my Epic Pass to Heavenly, Northstar & Kirkwood and bought the Tahoe Super Pass to Alpine, Squaw, Sugar Bowl + Sierra At Tahoe. TOTALLY worth it! Next two trips are more Alpine/Squaw and then Sugar Bowl. I like this pass more than the Epic, because you get a whole extra mountain (4 versus 3) AND, the other offers and benefits kind of outclass the Epic Passes. However, I miss Kirkwood, so I MIGHT eventually go back to the Epic pass for a season, but I TOTALLY recommend the Tahoe Super Pass -- ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!</Review>

Squaw Valley is a really beautiful place, but the prices are skyrocketing. I suggest going there with a tent, because it's place where you would be outside for most of the time.</Review>

I was a Lifty there a few years back. Best mountain in Tahoe. best terrain.
granite chef, headwall, KT22, broken arrow.
best runs in CA
Most advanced riding
KT22 is the best place to be on POW days
but the locals line up at like 6
so it doesn't last long
lifties are all stoned.
but that's every mountain in Tahoe.
but they discourage drinking on the job
so that's probably a plus for you

Very expensive for what you get. $169 for a day pass, that's more than I'd ever want to pay. Clearly Silicon Valley money at play here, but I have a hard time seeing the logic in "punishing" the people who actually show up with extreme pricing? Mammoth anytime instead</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) A paradise on earth without words. The scenery seen from the top of the mountain is so beautiful, and there is also a pool in the summer. Tracking with guides is also provided. At the end of July, the hot sun is falling, but the snow is not melting. Swimming in the pool is a place for many to remember. Good.

말이 필요 없는 지상낙원. 산 정상에서 본 경치는 너무 아름답고 여름은 풀장도 있다. 가이드와 함께 트래킹도 제공된다. 7월 말 뜨거운 태양이 내리 쬐는데도 눈이 녹지 않고 있다. 풀장에서 물놀이는 많은이에게 기억에 남을곳이다. 강추.< /Review><username>한혜진<//username></record>

<rating>5<//rating><review>(Translated by Google) Great place to spend time both in winter and in summer! Many active activities! Just keep in mind the place is at an altitude of about 2000 meters above sea level. Beautiful nature, in a special starry sky. Full service, choice of classes for any taste, will not leave anyone indifferent!

Отличное место, чтобы провести время как зимой, так и летом! Много активных занятий! Только учтите место находится на высоте около 2000 метров над уровнем моря.

<Text>(Translated by Google) It is a beautiful place, as it is, it is too expensive. However, it is very attractive with a thousand things to do, always have something to eat and with very good attention. Undoubtedly a beautiful place to vacation in winter and go skiing. I repeat, it is very expensive, a salad leaves 15 dollars, a hamburger leaves 14, skiing per day leaves 500 dollars and others.

Repito, es muy caro, una ensalada sale 15 dolares, una hamburguesa sale 14, esquiar por dia sale 500 dolares y demás.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGLAgKEHK1b9_jgx-N6JZiqzdFIJMB7nEYOnMX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEwlyaTI8ke01VtSwziuKdTFMWIBCAGFHNQQpw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3k9lV1pu4BIOdse7a9v1Fup_rlj1QlKDgZ7kf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfbuaK6-M9wObuoTDFJGBOpEu6hGf2iXOFWHdM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5heF5039zZMfhBCw0MxUQJDMKfUnlpzURLB8h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeGwVahCJriRs-RwPUavswgr4YjTEwF3uQj7Al=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg49acuqG1M4HzYyKvfLyXpI-h3mM78K0j4-2U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO_KAo61vO1TOcbNP19reqFbRZxTb3NI-JTu1E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb09FqjqW48abhdjNUST7oZTUNaZXSiOcpF5yU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsHsjbcfk5CGv_EWdJRLQePD78oUL8L6Xo7x3T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOShN3gJq9amZzVmu8h8eCePisiwKf3rJwH6d61=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_KGxD3PgZ_yrWdKOoIWEM2ltNeVhTiZHuCH-m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6eSywJ0Bx29HQ-YzUzBd8nCOhkF1FTw0mnPZ2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbELFxa5h388qHT24FuiisIxwczOLWdlemi2Rg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo1eF-qQcB_Cc2AeIsJ6XjFg5itOUgAdHFLVPr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPB1j1UQNa3pIT6y1PDh3rRWGQeVDw4sD6ouC4V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnBi3yDBOi17DKmZ-cNf5PlOP2WzjCa6WSeNRo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYzAv8iIuh2I8mAm8QPVzW-Go3Rtfrgy0lgfxe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8uIPpBkSedLyKItxVXHgFOjOd82D1Hc1qA93E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGKCZTi6P3ZtH8SALFPEC9TuAoeLqNeEjPIm2V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>{'time': 1580926835132, 'text': 'Thank you for the great review!'}< /response>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) We had a great ride: it was not very snowy and not all the slopes were open, but even so, we spent two wonderful days here. It can be quite crowded, especially on the lift ah, leading to the blue and green slopes. Come early. It is best to park right next to the lift on the left side of the parking lot.

(Original)
Отлично покатались: было не очень снежно и не все склоны открыты, но даже несмотря на это мы провели два прекрасных дня здесь. Может быть достаточно людно, особенно на подъемник ах, ведущих на синие и зелёные спуски. Приезжайте пораньше. Лучше всего парковаться прямо возле подъемника на левой стороне парковки.<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Good rooms, a little small and a little dark. The beds are absolutely fine and you can sleep well in them. The rooms are equipped with 2 TVs (satellite). The bathroom has a bathtub and toilet. The kitchen is well equipped with 2 hotplates, a dishwasher, a refrigerator with freezer compartment and a microwave. The balcony is not overly large, but it is absolutely sufficient. There is a swimming pool, 3 whirlpools and a sauna.

Das Bad hat eine Badewanne und WC. Die Küche ist gut ausgestattet mit 2 Platten, Geschirrspüler, Kühlschrank mit Eisfach und einer Mikrowelle. Der Balkon ist nicht übermäßig groß, reicht aber absolut aus. Es gibt ein Schwimmbecken, 3 Whirlpools und eine Sauna.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

{'time': 1545772791936, 'text': 'Hi Trevor. So sorry to hear you had this experience. Our ticket scanners sometimes do have to take passes that have issues (if this was your first time scanning your Ikon pass at Squaw, some of your information may not have fully transferred from Ikon to us yet.) While we do have the ability to fix 85% of pass issues at the gate, sometimes the passes need to be brought back to the office to figure out the issue. The ticket scanner should have issued you a ticket to use for the day and you can pick up your working Ikon pass from the ticket office at the end of the day.'}< /resp>
