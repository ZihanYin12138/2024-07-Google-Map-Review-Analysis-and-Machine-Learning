Fernando the receptionist is VERY nice and welcoming!! I think he has been my favorite receptionist here and I have been going to johnnys for YEARS! Vanessa does the best lashes and is very kind as well. There are some new techs who are really loud and gossip about there drunk nights but enjoy the welcome from Fernando and def. make your appointment with Vanessa TRUST ME!!</review>

I have been going to Johnny's Lashes for the past 4 years and today I was treated very poorly by the front desk person. I called to cancel an appointment as I had an emergency come up and I was told that I would be charged as I did not cancel within their time frame. I asked to speak with a manager was directed to an online chat on their website. While on the phone, I went online and there was no such chat. According to the front desk person, we cannot speak with the manager directly as we would need to go in and they would contact the manager themselves. After being told that "life is not fair", he said that I would be charged $10 for the missed appointment and that I also had another $10 late fee on my account that is showing unpaid which I find interesting considering I have been there many times and no one mentioned a $10 late fee that was due. Based off prior reviews, looks like this person has been rude and unprofessional before.

Sad but today the business lost a very loyal customer who has referred many people to their company.<//review>

Horrible!! I walked in at 8:15am and was told it was a 2 hour wait or I could come back at 4:30 and she would take in. I went in at 4 and was told they stop taking walk-ins at 3! I inform the girl up front that I was told to come back at 4:30. She said there was nothing she could do. They were all booked up! I asked why wad I told to come back. I would of waited in the morning had I known I wouldn't be able to get in later. Never going back again!< /Text>

I went in to get my Lashes done on Friday
Great customer service from receptionist the lady with a lot of tattoos and blonde hair very sweet girl
The only thing I did not like was that this Artist that actually do the lashes are always gossiping and even had the nerve to talk about their own Receptionist.. the big girl with black her was very disrespectful and tacky talking about the sweet receptionist</text>

The lashes look good and initially when you get them done. However 5 days later you will be charged for the glue flaking the lashes falling out in spots. The 1st receptionist had a stank attitude and you can never get Johnny or his wife Laura to make a complaint. So if you and want ro get real lashes done fussy will laar, go elsewhere. This is definitely the temporary glam shop. The techs try to play you like you have never worn lashes before. Get the cheapest ones cause that's the job they're going to give you. Thumbs down for me. They are just convenient for walk in service.<//text>

< review>
Second time going in and the first time was great. Went back in because they did not look even and dont even look as thick as the picture I was shown. But went back in and they fixed the one side but when I got home the lashes I lost from the first set on one eye looks completely different. I paid more then 50 and I am not happy. The sides keep falling off. But besides that because i do not have my normal lashes anymore because the first ones took them off in weird places. I will never look normal. As I said i took all rules to heart and even did not wash my face or put make up on.hopefully i get some justice Jonny.
Thank you

they are lashes are not extensions their lashes are the type that you get from the nail shop very heavy extremely uncomfortable I paid $69 and they were not the one by one they were the three lashes that makes your lashes look cheap and not professional when I called to tell them about my  discomfort  The reception was no help at all very bad attitude very unprofessional so I just wasted my money only had them on for three days and then I took them off so save your money and go to someone that really does extensions one by one Sorry not sorry< /Text>

<Text>They messed up on my lashes and only last a few days. So I made an appointment to get it fixed and my daughter ended up in the hospital due to someone running a stop sign. They do not care about people's well being. They still charge you even when you call 3.5 hours ahead and when  know there was a true emergency.</Text>< user_id>

Went to the upland location because it's the closest to me and even so, drove over 1 hour to get there. I scheduled my appointment online with someone specific and lashes were applied by someone else. The lashes were glued to my lid instead of the actual lash and were falling off by the next day. My eyelid began to swell and I had to get them removed on an emergency basis by someone else. It was such an awful experience. The process felt rushed, no one speaks to you and no one introduced themselves nor walked me through the process. I wont be going back.</Text>

So the customer service here is horrible. The receptionist is inexperienced, lathargic, and unapologetic. I went in to ask for an appointment in the am and she told me to go online because she still needed to check in the morning appointments. So I sat down waited for a bit and went on my phone to schedule something for later the same day. I FINISHED My appointment online before she even checked anyone in. Came back on my lunch and nothing was scheduled apparently their website didn't confirm my appointment there should have been a confirmation email and text and there was nothing in her computer. I asked her if she remembered me from the morning and  she said yeah. So she said she can take me as a walk in. I asked how long the wait was because I was on lunch and that's why I tried to schedule something earlier she looked confused and unable to answer my wait time question. I told her never mind and as I was walking out she was shouting to me if I wanted to schedule something for tomorrow. NO THANKS BYE FELICIA.</review>

I love this Salon. They did a wonderful job fixing my baby's hair. We visited the kids salon at plaza bonita and this lady did a worst haircut to my baby boy. So when we visited Bambinos Salon and the lady did a awesome job. Highly recommended.</Text>

First and foremost let  me start off by saying I don't know how this place is still in business. I wish my kids experience would've been about as good as yours. So I show up around 1:50 on January 26, 2018 to Bambino's and the place is empty. I was glad because I had to be at work by 5 and there is a lady who greeted us without even smiling. She looked up at us from reading a magazine and asked if she could help us. I told her my son needed a haircut and she asked me if I had an appointment. I said no and asked her if we needed one in order to be seen, she said no and that it all depended on whether the next appointment showed up or not. She asked if we wanted to wait so I said yes but decided to ask her first when the next appointment was. She hesitated and said the next appointment was at 5!! At freaking 5 and it wasn't even 2pm and she denied me services. I was furious!!! I had driven about 20 minutes, no customers, no wait, no appointments til 5 and she was sitting there reading a magazine getting paid to do nothing!! Never will I go back there again! And i do not recommend this place, save yourself the drive and your precious time people. And I hope there are cameras to verify my story so something can be done about this employee. I just hope the rest are not as incompetent as her.</Text>

They stylists are very sweet with my baby and they have a way of making him feel at ease. Not to mention the great cuts! The cuts are a little up there in price, but you get what you pay for.

<text>I wasn't aware you needed to make an appointment. So the wait was probably 20 min or so. The staff was somewhat friendly, could use some improvement considering its a salon just for children. My son's haircut was very nice, I just didn't care much for the staff or environment.</text><Response>None</Response>< Name>

The hairdresser was VERY patient with my toddler who was making it almost impossible to give him a trim yet she was still very nice and patient with him and gave him a pretty decent trim seeing as how much he was moving we will definitely be coming back<//review>

DON'T GO HERE. The lady at the reception is rude and not willing to help. She shouldn't work in customer service, perhaps something that doesn't involve talking to people. They say they take walkins but only if the next appointment doesnt show. Somehow they are always booked, who knows how even if the place is empty and dead silent... unbelievable. Instead go to Pigtails and Crewcuts, even if they're booked they manage to squeeze in walk in appointments, and they are actually nice, not like the terrible workers at Bambinos. On top of that, my son's haircut wasn't worth all the trouble I went through to get a haircut, I can do a better job with my eyes closed. This place sucks< /Review>

My son loves this place and doesn't want to get his hair cut anywhere else. Only 1 out of 20 haircuts was not too great, but it was a different barber.</text>

<Text>I've been going there for years. Previous owner gave me honest attention and I felt that I can always trust. New ownership seems to lack all from the previous ownership. I give all businesses a chance regardless of ethnicity of ownership. But, I admit that as a Mexican, I look forward to support Mexican ownership. However, that didn't seem to help here as I received a sub par service and attention. He seemed bothered and I witnessed owner ignoring me as I went for a follow up, walked right in front of me to greet another white client with a pleasant attitude I have yet to see from him. I was originally filled with freon at the highest price ever, but told me he wouldn't charge me if I needed refill.
Turned out, I ran out of air a day after in a long hot trip where my daughter vomited twice because of lack of air.
I returned to have it checked again and charged me an additional $600 ish over the phone for a new compressor, so I declined. He later called me for a lower price, which I accepted, but turns out that he included another gas recharge. He told me that he just put that in as paperwork.
Note that when they called when the job was done, my wife dealt with it and they tried charging her the $600 plus amount.
I'll see if give them a second chance. But, I wasn't thrilled about his upset offer to solve our disagreement by offering to replace the bad compressor back into my truck.< /Text><Resp>{'time': 1619819084547, 'text': "Thanks for the feedback.

Any decisions you've made when you left was at your own discretion. In regards to the follow up visit, we offered a $100 discount and would include the freon on us.

I had to review this place  because it was just a pleasant experience, minus the fact it was a baking hot day so it was a bit warm in the lobby I mean everything else was just a pleasant and friendly day. Jose was the mechanic that helped me and even down to giving me an ice cold drink and filling me in a couple of times during my repairs ànd checking on my well being they made me feel like family.. highly recommend this auto repair shop.. and you just can't find that kind of service very often....<//text>

I have been going here for years. They have new owners. I asked for a system flush and replace upper and lower hoses. I supplied the hoses. The mechanic replaced the hoses and added antifreeze without flushing the system and i saw that he did not have the upper hose properly fitted. I asked him to fit the hose properly and he did. He said antifreeze looked good. But my point was I wanted the system flushed. They do not take credit cards and only cash. If they continue to do business this way I'll find another place to go to.<//review>

I have come here 3 times over the past 5 years and they have done a fantastic job on my 1991 Lexus LS400. The first 2 times dealt with an air conditioner issue, the third the water pump, radiator reservoir and radiator. During the water pump install I had Paul’s crew install a new timing belt, serpentine belt and anything else that had to do with the inside engine, water pump area, wear and tear. My 22 year old car in 2013 runs smoother and quieter.

Paul and his crew did an excellent job at a great price. He’ll use only the highest quality parts and guarantees all of his work. This is a great place to get all of your air conditioning, heating system and general engine repaired. Paul, the owner, is super honest and will not do any unnecessary repairs. A place you can trust to get the job done right at a great price. I highly recommend the Radiator Depot & A/C Specialist.< /Text>

""""These first 8 lines added on 8/17 (for honesty) as an update for my review , so the place returned me back my money (the $80) after I called them again and tell them that it wasn't a fix or appropriate to deal with a customer so they did at least better than nothing ( the suck their freon back from the compressor though, but still wasted my time""'""

Don't ever go to this place
It's totally untrustworthy.
He simply have no experience at all and he ripped me off. He took $80 for nothing at all.

I went to him he checked  the car and he ordered the part needed to be replaced (I gave him $120 deposit as he asked with a good intention that he knows what he's doing) after 2 days the part was delivered so he called me I took the car to him he started working on it told me it's going to take couple hours then after coples hours he come and told me I have to leave the car till tomorrow because he wasn't able to figure  what is the problem!! and although it's frustrating and waste of time I told him that I'm going to take my car and come back in my day off, then he start talking more he said he ordered the wrong part but he said in fact he doesn't even know which part he should order (I think he ordered a used or refurbished part that does not work although he said he's ordering a brand new part and I'm saying this because it says Toyota genuine part and I have searched this part if it's the Toyota genuine and it way more expensive than his total estimate)  , and after couple minutes talking he tell me I didn't work on your car model before and you better take it to another shop(my car is a 2007 Toyota Camry) there are millions on the road . He told me I'm going to return the money to you and I said okay but now he's telling me like I have to charge you $80(return $40 out of my $120 I paid him as a deposit) for what? He didn't even know what's going on with the car so he didn't even diagnose it he is the one that doesn't want to take the job and he still want to charge me.
He simply have no experience at all and he ripped me off....
Don't go there .
You might be lucky but you might get screwed he have no experience and he would want to charge you still... don't pay for diagnosis or deposit till the job is done if you go there but it's better not to go.
Don't deal with him with good intentions till you get the job done and you check yourself.
I warned you !!!!< /Text>

A few days ago, our car had a busted radiator that we could jerry-rig decently enough to drive short distances. Took it to two different shops, both told me it had to be replaced, got quotes from 5+ shops on a radiator replacement... Paul beat them all by at least $200, and up to $500. Went in and he asked me what he quoted me, and being an honest man I told him the exact price he told me. He ended up charging me exactly that price (plus tax, but that's to be expected), while getting the work done in under an hour on a Saturday afternoon. Definitely going to recommend this place to anybody who's having radiator issues; Paul's honest, great work at great speed and great prices deserves to be widely-known.</Text>

I have been to Radiator Depot several times and each time has been a joy. Paul is honest and knowledgeable, and their prices have not been matched by anyone I’ve ever seen.
Today I paid $85 for what another mechanic called a faulty ac compressor and quoted me $900 for! Paul quickly realized the other mechanic was wrong and had me out of there in 30 mins. Cold air from my vents again!< /review>

Paul is amazing and and honest mechanic. I had a coolant leak in my car and was quoted from the dealership $800 for a brand new radiator and water pump for my mustang. Took my car to get inspected by Paul and he noticed right away that the cause of the leak was a small hole of the reserve tank. All he needed to do was get a new part from the dealership that only costed $85 and a coolant flush. It all costed me around $200 which saved me $600 right off the bat. I am very thankful for Paul and Radiator Depot for their honesty and amazing customer service/knowledge.< /review>

I had a radiator for my RV start leaking. A shop near my house wanted $700 to replace.
the radiator. I called Paul (the manager) he built me a new three core radiator using the
old tanks. He did a quality job and only charged me a little over $300. I did the instalation.</text>

After I refurbished a radiator,  3 months later it blew out.  Now it turns out "there is no warranty",  and the owner guy just doesn't want to deal with it...< /review>

Will not be going back here again. Yes, the staff was friendly. As for being knowledgeable, they are not. I had to tell them about my pets breathing problem AFTER they said her breathing was normal. It is not normal for a pet to be struggling to breathe. If I would have taken her to a different place, I would only have to had paid 1 time to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. Would be nice to get my money back, but know that I'm out of luck with that along with being without my pet.< /review>

<text>This place has some of the most patient nurses who are helpful with every step. Look I'm not perfect and I'm sorry to say that one day I was not in the best of moods and had to call Banfield to set up an appointment and ended up being told that my payments were being put on hold & that I wasn't able to use my credit card. Well that just set me off, but no matter how upset I got the nurse kept on trying to help and eventually it was all figured out & it ended up being some computer glitch. My point is that Banfield can roll with the punches and keep on being helpful! The best crew around, thank you for all the hard work you do and for all you put up with!</text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>After spending a sleepless night with my dog who coughed and wheezed all night, I walked into Banfield this morning at 9am.  I had my little one wrapped in a blanket. I would usually call for an appointment, but I needed help quickly.
They could have told me to come in later at their next open appointment time. But the doctor took her in right away. I found out my baby has pneumonia and Banfield has a client for life. I am very grateful to the Banfield staff and Dr. Lindsey.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Wilkins, Dr. Keller, and their supporting staff are incredibly helpful and gentle in their handling of sensitive news. They show genuine concern and care for the animals they treat and the fur parents that come with them. Drop-off options make for flexible appointment scheduling and the doctors always make sure that important information is understandable. Highly recommend this location!< /review>

My beloved dog was very sick and I had to have him put down. Anyone who considers their dog a member of the family can understand how terribly difficult and emotional this decision was. I requested he be cremated and paid a fair amount for this service. I was given no options so I assumed it was a normal cremation package. Today I picked up the remains and it has me distraught. There was no paw print which everyone else I know received and the container his ashes came in was no more than a pine box. No tooling in the wood ... Just a cheap wood box. I am broken hearted 💔. If you love your pet as much as I loved mine, find another place should you find yourself having to make this decision. Now I am not only grieving but I feel as if I have let down my best friend.<//text>

Saved my big boi...every time I take my animals we receive the best care and my big boi always leaves a happy camper. I've had so many pets that are terrified after leaving the vet but not here.< /Text>

The woman who answered the phone was on the rude side. She couldn't find my pets profiles and told me I would have to pay $51 for my pets visit even though my pets are on monthly plans. I gave her my phone numbers and she STILL couldn't find my information. She assumed I lived in Fresno and when I mentioned I lived in a different city she found it and didn't even apologize for not knowing how to do her job/making me feel like I don't pay to take my pets here. Personally have never been to this location but will never step foot here.<//Text><Rating>1< /Rating><date>1552939290320< /date></record>

<review>I have read the previous reviews and they all say Banfield is expensive and they do tend to be on the pricey side which is why I only gave them 4 stars. I have taken pets there for a least 13 years. I did have one pet die in surgery but the dog had a perforated bowel and the Vet was in tears when the dog could not be saved. It was not the Vet's fault. I have been there for a severe bee sting reaction, neutering, ear infection, eye injury etc. The receptionist is beyond kind and always helpful. The vet. assistants are the same. The vet I see, Dr. Orth is fantastic and I would trust her with my pets any day. It also comes in handy to have a Vet that has weekend and evening hours for those emergencies that can come up. And they do not charge extra for weekend and evening visits as most other Vet's do.  I also enjoy being able to look around at the latest dog toys if I have to wait. But when I have had an appt. I have not had to wait very long.</review>< Name>

<Text>Katie F was absolutely fabulous. We have been shopping around for a few months and decided to purchase a mattress through her ultimately because of her professionalism and transparency as a salesperson. Her customer service was far superior to any of the other stores we visited. She made this an enjoyable experience. I have recommended her to my friends and family.<//Text><Response>{'time': 1613414545088, 'text': 'Ashely thank you very much for the Google Review.

Walked in today and we were greeted by Brandy. She was the only one there, but that is to be expected for a Monday.

She was very friendly and she had so much knowledge about all the mattresses. We told her what were were looking for and what we wanted to spend. Based off our preferences, she showed what she believed we would like and she told us what we wouldn’t like and why, then let us try it and she was right.

We ended up leaving spending a bit more than what we wanted but it aligned with our long term goals of what we wanted for our mattress.

Thank you Brandy! You were amazing.</Text>

<text>Great job Mattress Firm with having Brandy Brizuela as an ambassador for your store. We cannot say enough about her and the service she gave us today.

We went to three mattress stores in Sacramento looking for a superior mattress, at a great price and great warranty.

When we walked into Mattress Firm and met Brandy, our expectations were met and exceeded!  She was extremely knowledgeable about every mattress, including clearance prices available for certain ones, and warranty’s on the new mattresses.
She went above and beyond for my husband and I!  Her customer service was extraordinary, giving us personalized attention, and with her level of service, we were in and out in less than 20 minutes, feeling extremely pleased because we got THE best deal in Sacramento, after shopping all day long.

Thank you again Brandy for the amazing experience you gave us today at Mattress Firm. We really appreciate it!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I came in nervous to make a big purchase like this with little to know about mattresses and what would work best for me and my spouse. She was enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and so very kind. Not to mention very patient with how many beds I laid on over and over again lol. And her manager (didn’t catch her name), was also amazing. Those two gals made what was a nerve racking purchase, so fun and smooth. Not to mention the great finance options for those that can’t put that big of a dent in their savings. Will definitely refer any others to them!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Had an amazing experience. Brandy went beyond neccessary to help and accommodate me in everyway possible. She helped me find the right mattress for my needs and helped keep within my budget. Very attentive and asked me lots of questions to help me figure out which type worked best for me. First time buying a bed and it was amazing service. Highly recommend anyone give them a try before you go somewhere else you won't regret it.<//text>

The person Samantha who helped us was AMAZING. Totally amazing and we were able to get a new mattress and financing done so fast. Definitely taught us and showed us exactly what we wanted when we didn’t know ourselves. Perfect customer service; bittersweet I got an amazing mattress because that means I probably won’t get to talk to her again! Amazing.<//Review>

Was mattress shopping and thought it wouldn't hurt to check this place out, even though it was out of our price range. Didn't expect to buy anything, but wanted an idea of what we may want. Jenna was freaking amazing. Zero pressure sales, super friendly, got the feeling of relaxation and ease. Jenna could have sold us a rainbow pony with wings and we'd still buy from her. She even sold us the protection package and mattress sheets, which honestly didn't feel she hassled us, but helped us. Giant thumbs up Jenna! She totally needs the recognition!</Review>

I will never buy another mattress from anyone else. Jenna, the store manager of this location had me ROLLING in laughter. We hit it off immediately and I felt zero pressure. She was quite frankly the most helpful person, I wish she sold cars, houses, all of the above LOL! I will be sure to send everyone I know to her! We had the best experience! after years of putting this big of a purchase off, we walked in still very uncertain but we told her all about my husbands incredible back issues at 28 and how I wasn’t sure i was ready to seep like a 90 year old! LOL.  Thank you  sooo much Jenna!!!!</Review>

Had a great shopping experience and got a deal on a Nectar mattress.

Jenna was very helpful and accommodating with letting us try multiple types of mattresses before settling on the soft yet firm Nectar. She even got it to my place the very next day!

We knew we wanted a Tempur-pedic matress before we even walked.into the store. We were helped by Jenna, who made the experience excellent for us. We tried the different firmnesses and styles and chose which one we wanted. After we left the store Jenna even called back to tell us she had found the exact bed we had just bought on clearance (returned and sanitized) to save us money if we wanted. We opted for the new bed, but it was very kind of her to give the option to save money. Overall great experience and would recommend!< /text>

<text>Recently our mattress was stolen from a moving truck, which was really frustrating and inconvenient. On the hunt for a new mattress I call a number of Mattress Firm stores and each person I spoke to was amazing 👏 Samantha at Mattress Firm Clearance was the best of the best!!! Samantha was knowledgeable, sympathetic, and extremely kind. Everyone at Mattress Firm made this less than ideal situation less stressful and at time even enjoyable.<//text>< Resp>

The service we got from Tyler was exceptional. SO professional and friendly. We were referred to Mattress Firm by our granddaughter explicitly because of Tyler. She got a mattress with his help a couple weeks before. Your organization could use 100 more Tyler's....We will tell everyone about our experience.  Denice Elder<//text>

Easy process. Purchased the mattress and was out the door in about 5 minutes. Picked up at the warehouse across town in about 15 more. Had it on the bed in under an hour. Good price. Got a free adjustable base too.<//Text>

Hands down the best experience I’ve had with mattress shopping, thanks to Tyler. I didn’t feel rushed or pressured to buy anything beyond what I was willing to spend! Tyler made sure that I left feeling like this was a win, and not feeling unsure of my investment. I could’ve slept the day away trying out mattresses and I’m pretty sure Tyler would’ve let me, without hassling me about what I was thinking, if I was ready to move forward, etc. Go here if you’re looking to be taken care of the right way. Thanks again, Tyler!</text>

Very nice options and we also were looking for bed frames. Unfortunately they didn’t have any but we were looking at prices. Our first time looking for a mattress. The tall blonde man was very helpful but my boyfriend and I weren’t set yet. We wanted to know or options. He gave us some attitude when we told him we might look other places for a bed frame or finding a place that might sell the frames as well..but might be coming back after for mattresses if we couldn’t find what we were looking for. Maybe that’s just how I want to do it but I want to see prices. Try them out before I just buy something..I understand he was looking at prices for us and I appreciate the help. We almost decided to buy a mattress until he had an attitude with us. It was unfortunate because the last one we looked at was one we would have bought and we were talking about our plans to figure this out and make sure we can get a frame and box spring as well. Unfortunately won’t be back here.. made our first big step together uncomfortable.< /text><Date>1546211061979< /Date></record>

Hands down tyler is the man to go with! He made it happen for us. We went in hoping not to get a sales rep that was pushy. Thats what we got he gave us the time and space to talk about things he let us try the matress out at one piont we couldnt decide beteen two so he said spend 15 min one each one and see if you can decide so we did and it definitely made our choice clear.. he gave us privacy with out the awkward "can you give us a moment to talk" haha over all if i can give them/ him 10 ⭐ i would!</Review>

There service I received when I went into the store was Fantastic! Shane was very helpful and answered all my questions, he even helped me stay within my budget. The reason for only 3 stars is because, I bought the bed on Tuesday (7/31/18) and I set up delivery for that Thursday. Shane told me I would get a call Wednesday night after 7pm to let me know when they would delivery the bed. I never got a call. Now it's Thursday morning, I have errands to run but can't because I have no clue as to when the bed will be delivered.<//review>

<text>Mattress firm clearance store Arden way, Sacramento, CA
Sales rep/Manager: Shane
Paid about $1,000 for queen foam mattress.

We were explicitly told by the sales rep/manager, Shane, that we able to return the mattress after 30 days with only a restocking fee of $80.00. We want to be happy with the mattress but that is not what is happening. We called the store prior to bringing the mattress to the store and they told us that it would be an $80.00 restocking fee (which we were aware of) and $80.00 [forced] delivery fee because they need to “check the environment” of where the mattress was. By the state of California, it is illegal to sell a used mattress so why would it matter to “check the environment” and forced your customers to an $80.00 [forced] delivery fee when we can deliver it ourselves.

We also had issues with the mattress cover that we had been extremely pressured and duped into purchasing. A couple days after the purchase, we decided we didn’t need the unopened mattress cover. Those things are easily returnable to any other store but not this one. We were told that we cannot return mattress covers unopened or not.

So we are potentially spending an ADDITIONAL $210.00 just to return the mattress and forcing to keep a subpar mattress cover after spending about $1,000 on a mattress that we don't even like.

Im extremely disappointed with how this business is being ran. The customers are the reason why you have a business and when you soil your reputation, expect for your business to follow suit.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Date>1543614400657< /Date>< name>

KID FRIENDLY, BEST STAFF, GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICES!
Juan was amazing! We are getting my son his first bed, and he was really reluctant to go in. Our sales rep let my son try out the different matresses and how they felt, (even called him "rocketship" like my son asked him to being silly!) and was so patient with him (3 years old) and my nephew (9 years old). He was also patient with me, I'm incredibly indecisive.
If you're a parent you dread doing things with your kids like mattress shopping. Well this location has a fun little activity/play table to entertain them, and as I said before Juan was AMAZING helping my son to be excited about picking his own bed and being part of the process! He even let my nephew be part of the decision! He helped me find a great quality product in my price range!
One of my best customer service experiences ever!
This place is great, and thanks to Juan they have a customer for life!<//review>

The guy that helped me was very pushy, nice at first but when my cousin started asking questions his attitude changed really quick. When I told him I would think about this since it is somewhat of a big decision, the payments were a little high for me. He became almost hostile. He said that I already knew how much I made so what was there to think about. It even seemed like he was blocking the door when I explained why I needed to give this consideration. It made me feel uncomfortable and definitely not interested in buying a mattress from him.</Text>

< Review>
My husband and I were driving past and saw their store. I had had a right, top, lobectomy on my lung 3 1/2 weeks ago. It was a very painful and uncomfortable surgery that can take 3-6 months to heal and sometimes a year. We wanted to get an split California King adjustable bed. They were great. We picked one out, was approved for financing and it will be delivered next Saturday. Katie was a great salesperson. We couldn't be more happy.<//Review>

<text>I got some adobada tacos here last night, they were cold, the meat didn’t taste like anything and the tortillas were nasty. Oh by the way I paid $12 something for 4 tacos! I wouldn’t care that the food was overpriced if it was decent but it wasn’t. If you want some good Mexican food go to burritos Santana, it’s in Winchester too.< /text><userid>110969832972674815345< /userid><time>1609575263055</time><Name>John Doe< /Name>< Response>

<date>1583643695724<//date><review>The Primos at Winchester and Murrieta Hot Springs Rd. We visit this evening around 8pm. My order was simple, you would think. Nachos! They tasted like "Nachos from Stale" Chips, meat, and beans. All stale. The cook was talking about his work hours  being reduced to the Cashier Woman when we walked in. A man was asleep in the first booth with has head face down on the table with no apparent food purchase.  Just asleep. Two other patrons waiting on their orders to go. Our other order wasn't any better. This is my first time at Primos in 5 years. It was a disappointment then and unfortunately a disappointment tonight.  So much for second chances.< /review>< Rate>

Came to the location and told them we only got 1/2 our order. Waited for over 30 minutes to get the rest of the food 😴 and while waiting they are making other people's food that came in after I did. This location SUCKS also they should have more than 2 people working. This is BS.<//text>

One of the burritos came with only egg, not an ounce of chorizo to be seen. Both orders of huevos rancheros and chilequiles only came with rice, not beans...which is strange.

We will not be eating at this location again as it seems everything we ordered had something wrong.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80db7e779e39ca29:0x4eca1da7f3b73f9f</GmapID></record>

When they finally picked up the phone, I ordered a couple of street tacos with a side of beans. I made the mistake of sending my son to pick up my food. Turns out they gave me rice instead of beans. Mind you the side of rice was about 4 ounce- $3!! That's not even the bad part. I drove back to the store to get my side of beans. The girl that was mopping stopped cleaning and started warming up a side of beans without washing her hands- gross! 🤢 I took back the rice and I left. I stopped coming to this location because they always get my order wrong, they over cook my food & the employees lack common sense and courtesy. I will stick to the mall location with the drive through. However, they have all become ridiculously over priced!< /Review>< pictures>

As regulars of this place we typically wouldn’t have a complaint. Today we went in a bit earlier then we normally would as we always go later at night. A lady in her 30s or 40s, white complexion, heavier set, whom was supposed to be running the counter and was doing a poor job as we stood at an empty counter waiting to order when we got there and then again when asking for a to-go box. Lucky the cook saw me and went to pass me one. I took one step to the side of the counter to grab it from him and as I’m saying “Thank you man” I’m cut off with “I can’t have you back that far, you need to get back!” From the back In a unbelievably rude tone. Sorry lady, do your job so others don’t have to do it for you. Not my fault your 40 going home smelling like beans and guacamole. The cooks great tho. Foods always good.</Text>

Not authentic Mexican food. It's flavors are missing but it's good if you're craving Mexican and there's nothing else.. which there isn't in the area.</text>

I stopped by here in the morning just close to lunch. They were pretty busy taking and making orders, so be prepared to wait a bit. They make food to order, but the quality is worth it. There is a salsa bar with Jalapeno and Habenero Salsa as well as Pico. You can munch on chips and salsa while waiting. Been here many times and the foid is always great!< /review>

The serving sizes are outstandingly big, (so maybe share 1 order between 2 people if you don't want to eat too much), but it's ok if you're hungry. Everything's delicious aside from the meat being pretty underseasoned. It's a bit pricey too, but it's fine since the servings are so big.< /review>

I am not one of those reviewers who rate based off if of one experience. I have gone here occasionally throughout th3 years and I have never had a bad experience. If you think of it, many businesses in the area are franchises, and some are family owned. So we must be human first and realize that mistakes happen. Be a good neighbor and rate them honestly. But in my opinion, their food is good. Period. Plus they are friendly, and that is why I gave then 4 stars. :)<//text>

Favorite burrito spot by my house. I love the tomatillo salsa with fresh lime on everything.  I haven't been disappointed in anything I get here and usually come when I feel like a quick bite. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.<//Text>

Tip: They have three different burritos with the word California in it. Be sure to double check that you order the correct one.

I really like the California breakfast burrito from here. I'd eat it any time of day. The rest of the food here seems pretty hit or miss, depending on the cooks in the kitchen. The people who work at the order counter could really use some training and some supervision. They do a lot of standing around, doing nothing when customers aren't ordering food.<//Review>

Order the carne asada nachos for 9.95. Did not notice the 1.50 charge tip they snuck on there. So either they charge 1.50 for using a card or they decide to add their own tip to your bill. Called them and they just hung up on me. Will never go back again. Also telling all friends to avoid this place, they will just rip you off.</review>

I hesitate to give one star. Been going for years but never again. Food was cold and bland.  Tostada shells were hard as rocks. I think the carne asada was old. Too expensive even if it was edible.</review>

<Text>Look, I’m generally pretty fair, but I am honestly regretting not going to del taco. So, I ordered the Cali breakfast burrito, no sour cream add beans. I got a Cali breakfast burrito WITH sour cream and NO beans. I asked for a custom order, it happens, no biggie. Ask them to fix it. Guy behind the grill throws a fit asking to see the receipt because he doesn’t believe it. So, once he realizes I’m right, (btw, this receipt interaction is happening loudly between the cashier girl and him in front of me and clearly upset at me), he goes ahead and adds the beans. But there’s still sour cream in the burrito. He wraps it up, slams it on the counter, cashier sees it and IGNORES it. Cook says nothing. Fuming, I walk out, but I don’t complain. I go sit around the corner with my wife and dog and start eating. She ordered quesadillas. So, both of our foods had eggs. These eggs were SO WET!! And the guy just POURED on the chipotle sauce or whatever it is on both of our meals and so they were just like an ocean inside. It was a really terrible feeling to bite into. Her quesadillas tortillas were still fresh out of the package seemingly. It fell apart and everything was just a mess.

To sum up, the staff could be better, the cook needs to be changed though for sure. Mid twenties, tall Spanish speaking dude. Around 5:50 pm. The food was terrible. I won’t be returning, but based on the fact the business has so many negative reviews both on FB and Yelp, I’d venture to say they don’t care. Maybe the day shift is better, but I will never find out. Biggest waste of $18 for a burrito, quesadilla, and a small drink I’ve ever made. This refers to the Los Primos off Hwy 79 N and Benton, next to the Del Taco that also sucks where I should have eaten instead.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1516844414149, 'text': "We sincerely appologize for the experience you had with Los Primos.

They couldn't get a potato taco right. Asked what was on it, and what I was told was completely different than what I got. Apparently after explaining that I'm allergic to eggs, they thought I meant some strange kind of european bird that didn't exist in the states. Half eggs, half potato. No lettuce, no cheese. I ask them, they quickly "fix"it and return with potato in a tortilla. Nothing else. I ask them to put lettuce and cheese on it. Finally! Then I bite into barely cooked potato.  Couldn't even eat it. Worst mexican experience ever</Text>

<Review>Horrible service. The drive through cashier refused to give me the sauce I requested because they were running low ( this at 9pm long after the dinner rush). When I requested to purchase extra she refused and closed the drive through window on me.< /Review><userid>109708220561707466365< /userid><response>None< /response></record>

<review>We've been going here for a while now and the service was what was expected of a smaller taco shop. But our last visit was awful. We ordered and paid for a full order of bacon chipotle fries and we were given a half order and they argued with us about the size. The amount was noticably different there was minimal amounts of chipotle sauce on it and bacon on the top once you really got in to it there was nothing but fries. Its the rudest service ive experienced there. I'm extremely disappointed with the food. The girl behind the counter was rude and distracted while helping us and the man that was there was rude as well. This place sucks now. It went down hill completely. Not worth eating there any more<//review><GmapID>0x80db7e779e39ca29:0x4eca1da7f3b73f9f< /GmapID>< rate>

We are new to town and decided to try this place on Taco Tuesday night, I had 2 fish tacos and my husband had a Baja burrito. As soon as I ate my tacos I got instantly sick, had cramps and heartburn all night. This morning both my husband and I had horrendous diarrhea and camps. WON'T GO BACK AGAIN< /Review>

<text>I just bought a cali burrito with guacamole. And I had to pay for the guac😏 It had No flavor! It had chunks of cooked tomatoe. When they said it has pico de gallo I thought it was fresh. No it wasn't! It was cooked😠 Then I asked for carrots. Omg! The carrots were so old, they tasted bad and were falling apart. I will never go there again.<//text>< Pics>

Why would they Ever get rid of their Albondigas?!!! Their Menudo is worst than the canned menudo & I actually love certain canned menudos... They should've gotten rid of tbeir menudo NOT the Albondigas, Smh. Get rid of the Los primos off of Winchester & whatever that mall street is in Temecula, Ca. It's not a good look when it comes to that taste. Put another 24hour fast food Mexican joint there that actually gives a damn...

The smallest burrito I've ever had and probably the most expensive. $7.69 is worth MUCH more. Not coming back.<//Review>

<review>They messed up my order and when I went back get the order corrected the lady gave me back the burrito I returned, stating they got the order correct (they did not). She was a total b****. I asked for my money back. DO NOT EAT HERE!!! These people are horrible, and their fun is junk.</review>< Pictures>

I was recommended this salon by a girl who worked at Trader Joe’s who had super cute nails. I was not disappointed! Everyone was kind and Ivy did a beautiful job on my acrylics. Definitely my new favorite nail salon!<//text>

<review>Helen is my go to nail artist. My friend dragged me along to do my nails and Ive been going ever since. Always love catching up with Helen while she works magic. The shop is clean and covid safe. Weekends of course are busy so I'd make an appointment. Also when you get your nails done they hand you a paper and if your nails get messed up in a week you can go back and get them touched up.</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I could talk all day about how amazing this nail spa is but I’ll keep it simple. Now that I’m back in Arkansas, I’m wanting to fly out to Cali every three weeks just to get my nails done. They know what they’re doing, offer a nail insurance for a week, and are priced pretty reasonable compared to other places. I got spoiled and now I’m on the hunt for a new salon. Phoebe was my personal favorite!</Review></record>

<review>I’ve been going here for a year and have used almost every single nail technician and they are ALL AMAZING!

I usually ask for Kim (she did my nails in the photo) or Lily but if they are busy Hannah & Anna are great too!

They are busy so please call and if you don’t like something just tell them and they will be accommodating! I usually go to Koreatown for my glass nails but now I just go here because it lasts forever and they always get it perfect every time!<//review>< Name>

Ruby is the best. She paid attention to detail she gave me exactly what I wanted and the price was not bad either. 😊🙏🏾< /review>

Chi is the BEST nail tech. She goes above and beyond. I only take one star off cause the manager lady can be rude sometimes.< /Review>

< Review>
As far as prices go, HIGHWAY ROBBERY!!!
I don't have complaints about the service itself, I will say the work on my nails was done great! But absolutely NOT worth the price.
I had already been to the spot once before and got a full set for $45 (more then my usual spot but I was in a hurry and this place looked good)
I called in beforehand because I needed a fill and asked pricing for "gel fill on acrylic long nails", the gentlemen on the phone told me $25
I went in for a fill and also had one broken nail (I figured $5 extra to fix)
When the lady hands me the slip its $42!!!!!!!
$42????? You mean to tell me it was $17 to fix a broken nail !? Absolutely RIDICULOUS!
Never again will I go back !!!!<//Review>

This was my first time going to this place my daughter-in-law turned me on to it. I have been going to Ann's nails for 7 years and in those seven years have I ever been asked but I like a new set. So I think I have found a new place I am a specially happy with the girl that did my nails her name is Christine. Thank you for making me feel welcome</Review>

<Text>The staff is really nice but their technique is comparable to that of a five year old. There is gel polish on both the cuticles of my fingers and toes. They were busy and it is evident that they rushed. They care more about customer turnover than quality and I will never go back here.< /Text><name>Mama Man< /name>< user>

<review>This was once my go to place. After a long hiatus I decided to take my daughter in to have a mommy daughter day. The girl who did my pedicure was horrible!! I go to get my nails done for the relaxing massage and friendly service. This place sadly lacked both😌 Needless to say I won't be back and it wasn't a fabulous experience:(</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I don't want to highlight this store, but if you want to comment, you should put its star to the store.  I have no problem with the ladies working there but I have a problem with the manager she’s was very rude and did not know how to talk to customer  in a nice way to make me think I did my nails for free and I will never go there and I would not advise anyone to go there :/:/:/< /Text>

I have been going to Holly for years.  I get a pink and white full set and they are perfect every time.  She carries on great conversation with me and she remembers things about my family.  her sister also works there, I cant remember her name, but she does great pedicures as well.  Love this place!<//Review>

<Review>Amazing service from everyone who has helped me. Ana is my nail tech but I go to anyone for my pedi. And I'm always happy. I refer everyone who compliments my nails to them. As a licensed climatologist my standards are pretty high.  They are the total package clean, talented, friendly, and professional.< /Review><user_id>116116488282000094556< /user_id>< response>

<text>I dropped in after a business meeting, looking to kill time while traffic was bad, and boy am I glad I did. I cannot say enough good things about my manicure. It got an acrylic overlay with a unicorn chrome polish and it looks SO GOOD. Like I find myself staring at my nails because the colors shift in the light and it's so pretty. Also, I got the manicure 17 days ago and it still looks amazing. No chips, nothing broken, and it's still shiny. I live 30 miles away but I might just brave the traffic to go back because it was just that good.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I had a great experience getting my gel manicure from Coco and a pedicure from Lily. I'm picky and they were both very meticulous and pleasant to talk to. I really love my nail designs and my toes came out way better than I pictured. I would definitely recommend others to try Lovely Nails.< /Review>

I don't usually pamper myself but I got a pedicure here back in February. I loved that they put some nail growth formula (i think) and it made my nails grow longer than I ever could! I'm definitely going back here for my pedicures!< /Text>

<Review>I would not recommend this place for any man who is on his feet most of the day. I was charged $35 for a pedicure that was supposed to be basic. I was told she gave me a 5 minute massage yet I left with a callouses on my feet. Very friendly and but overprice with mediocre service in my opinion again I'm a man who's in work boots for about 12 hours A-day</Review>< Rating>

Friendly staff.  They do a great job every time and stand behind their work. They have a timeframe for fixing nails damaged in the immediate days following service.< /text>

First time here. $20 for pedicure. Made appt during lunch work week at 1pm. I did not have to wait!!!! They took me at scheduled time!!! Busy, a bit noisy. 30 minutes from start to finish. It did the job, nothing spectacular. Massage part a bit meager but acceptable. Good selection of polish.  Polish wasnt painted the neatest. No fans or lights for drying. I was moved right out of the seat pretty much out the door. Not a big deal for me cuz im a skilled wet paint walker. Will go back due to convenience and it was acceptable.< /Review>

Just want to say thank you to the team. They are responding to all that is going on around them with integrity and great patience. I am a first time gun owner and they took the time to train me in safety  and made sure I was comfortable with my purchase. They were knowledgeable,  efficient,  and sincere through the entire transaction. Thank you!<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Awesome customer service
Very respectful I didn’t know what I wanted for a firearm . John showed me so many and helped me narrow down my search . He was very knowledgeable and kind with me not knowing this stuff .

I have to be honest here
I’ve been to other gun shops in Stockton and was treated not so nice for being a new purchaser and a woman, no respect , from other gun shops by making comments of my knowledge and showing me big and tinitiny guns while laughing . I felt so intimidated that I didn’t Want to give them my business .

So when I went to go buy my new firearm here at integrity Arms  I was ecstatic.!

John showed me the different options that would fit my hand and made me feel confident to what I was purchasing . The guys here will treat you with respect and that goes real far for me being a woman .  I will be buying all my guns and ammo here .

So gal pals go see John or really any team member that works here no intimidation no stress and they go the extra mile to make sure what you are buying is what is best for you . Thank you John for the excellent service
Peace and happiness

<rating>1<//rating><Text>I do not own guns, I am attempting to buy one. These guys are making it as hard as California is. I came here to take the FSC (common sense) test. He told me they have no handguns and to wait till I'm buying. I told him I found one online and was going to have it shipped to this location. And he still refused to let me take the test, without asking any information from me. My guess is because I'm not buying it from them, but I still need ammo, a case, ear muffs, cleaning kit. They missed out, besides they get $60 fee from me for dealer transfer.... Never coming back here, and of you don't own a gun, definitely don't waste your time with this shop.<//Text>< pictures>

These guys are professional and very friendly. Being a girl and a first time buyer, I was very "green" and the guys were patient with my questions and concerns. I was greeted by name when I came back to pick up my firearm, which made me feel welcomed. I highly reccomend this shop.<//Review>

Two rifles bought here and always great service. I had them fix another rifle for a modest price. They go above and beyond when it comes to customers. I watch them take extra time with people who are not familiar with something and are even willing to find out the answer they did not know rather than spitting out a bs answer. I look forward to buying from them again.< /Text>

Came here with my Husband, whose review is below. Most gun shops are about the same, to me, with fairly general stock and pretty standard solemn faced people. Not this place. They have a pretty fantastic variety of guns and we even found the clips we were looking for that we couldn't find anywhere else (that wasn't online). There are some really interesting and novel pieces around the store as well.
The folks are very friendly and pleasant, they're extremely fun to talk to, and reasonably knowledgeable. Filling out the paperwork for my Marlin was a breeze and took barely any time at all. I actually really like their selection of rifle bags much better than large chain stores. They seem to be of higher quality and the prices are comparable, some even better than.
The overall setup of the store is nice and expansive, open and comfortable, yet doesn't have that "bare shelf" feel you can get at similar places.
Overall I definitely recommend stopping by. It's a trek from where we are, but we'll be back. It's worth the drive.</Text>

<Text>Super pleased at what I am experiencing here so far! The owner John is very helpful, knowledgeable and community focused. I have already made a sale and a purchase and am referring others here as well. This town needs a gun store where people are treated such that they feel they are important. So many gun stores have such a "I'm cool and you are not" attitude, thank God this store is not that way.  5 Stars!</Text>< Pics>

<text>All I can say is wow! By far best gun shop in Lodi and the surrounding areas. Guns are very reasonably priced, and he keeps a good inventory of pistols, shotguns, hunting and AR  style rifles. John and his crew at integrity arms are very knowledgeable with their guns and ammunition and can answer any question you could think of about our local gun laws. Integrity arms is a no pressure place that you can look and buy guns! I have bought a few guns from John and crew and never felt pressured that I had to buy anything from them, they have definitely earned a lifetime customer.< /text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x809aa014c68c56d7:0x4184ca83c8750b8a< /GmapID></record>

The gentleman was VERY knowledgeable about guns, ammunition, laws, manufacturers, etc. They have a pretty good selection of pistols, rifles, and shotguns, and ammunition. If a type/size/brand of ammunition isn't stocked on the shelves they can order it in for you. I was extremely happy with everything about this shop from the employees, to the guns, down to the cases. My new favorite gun shop. I will be coming here for my ammunition purchases and my future gun buys.<//Text><rate>5<//rate>< Time>

Great store all around! The guys here are professional, easy to get along with and knowledgable. I've gone to this shop about a dozen times and I never get anything less than amazing service. The owner is real appreciative of his customers. He's a genuine guy who will go out of his way to help a customer even if he isn't making a profit.<//Review>

I'd give it a zero if I could. If they don't tell the truth about when they receive shipments, how can I trust to purchase a firearm from them? Buy elsewhere.</text>

I've made a few purchases at Integrity Arms, had a gun or two shipped to them and have done several PPT's there.  All I can say is that John, and company, are A+ all the way.  Great customer service and good knowledge of the industry.  It's a nice shop, set -up well and inventory is good.  I hope to give him more business and send him more business.<//Review>

An employee was very misinformed on laws and gave horrible advice and was a bit condescending. However the owner (John) made things right and made sure his employee was more up to date on what is legal and illegal.< /Text>

Went in and got the exact Kimber I wanted and Mossberg. Wasn’t even in the store 30 minutes all together. Also had a great time talking it up with the guys working and the owner. Pick up of my firearms was just as great. Did my safety check, talked about the Industry, had a few laughs, and headed out. This will always be my spot in Lodi from now on!<//Review>

First couple times coming had decent service. Was straight in and out with what I wanted. 3rd time I had them look at a firearm to install a part I bought from them. Finish on my gun was beat and dinged with a hammer during this, the employee who did it apologized and got the (manager?), and the (manager?) With the braces was acting like they were going to fix it. So After getting a quote on getting it cerakoted again, I took it back in. The employee who had originally damaged it was present and apologized again for damaging it, took me around the store looking at cases for compensation so I could mail it out for the repairs. and got the (manager?) with the braces to come out to sign off on it Who told me that I damaged it myself. The employee who damaged it just looked at the floor and said nothing.. Very displeased to have a 500 dollar cerakote job damaged by inexperience. Was about to purchase 2 rifles that day as well, but went down the street and had a much better experience and service at the other gun store in lodi.</text>

Great place and relaxed environment to buy, look and feel out firearms. The owner John is very nice and willing to help out in anyway to get what your looking for in your hands. What I don't notice about Integrity Arms is that clique feeling that many gun shops have. Every person is treated with dignity and respect. The prices of ffl service and gun are among the lowest I've seen, even rivaling internet prices. All in all you can go to Integrity Arms and get great customer service and feel confident you've got a great price too.< /review>

Went to Integrity Arms for the first time to try and get a duplicate firearm safety certificate. Sportsman’s Warehouse would not accept my FSC because the name of the person who issued the certificate was not legible.
John was extremely helpful explaining the FSC process.  Turned out there was no problem with my certificate since the number on the FSC is what matters. John even offered to price match the sale price at Sportsman’s.
Fifteen minutes later the deal was done and Integrity Arms is my new favorite place to buy a firearm.< /Text>

Have not swam at Calphin Aquatic Club since it first opened.  Actually I was quite reluctant to go back, but I did and was pleasantly surprised 😊.
The crowds were gone, due to Covid-19 and their adherence to the strict protocols is impressive.  A big improvement was how the front office is run.  A huge difference from when they first opened!!  Josh has
excellent customer service skills and to me, that speaks volumes!!  Although the pool is fantastic,  it's the people who work there that make the experience a positive one.  👍👍
Cannot say enough about how far this club has come from it's earlier days!!  High 5's to the new management and staff!!!</Text>

We had an extremely bad experience with Calphin. They automatically deduct the fees for next session. Due to Covid 19, we had to cancel the enrolled session due to unavoidable reasons. They asked for a lot of details & proof for cancelling. We provided all the details but still they refused to refund the amount, The helpdesk was extremely rude, doesn't have any idea of customer service or how to treat customers and are ONLY INTERESTED IN GRABBING YOUR MONEY. please be extremely cautious in case if you have to cancel, you should forget about your money<//review>

<text>Hello, Calphin cancelled swim lessons during covid 19 pandemic and credited my balance to their Calphin portal account. I was trying from last 2 months to get back my refund back in to my account. Recently they opened the club and when I told them I am not ready to send my kids back to swimming during this covid hard times. When I asked my 2 kids amount refund back they are saying as per their policy I have to use it or recommend some kids to their club and transfer my amount to them so that I can get back my money from other kids parents if some one join on behalf my kids.

This looks like not professional at all by the club rules and they are very very rude while talking with the customers. Can anyone suggest what can I do further to get my money back. It's not small amount to leave.

I am not sure what to do further and now a days they are not picking my call also. Please advise.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Our kids have been swimming here for years and we had been happy. But starting this year, there are very obvious recession on the organization and teaching quality. Some of the coaches don't teach the kids in their classes even once during the whole one hour lesson. Some don't show and leave  the dozens of kids in the pool without supervision. Owners and managers don't bother to find substitute. Perhaps they don't even notice. Kids from multiple levels are often combined into one super crowded group with only one coach. We are considering switch to  other places or get private lesson if we stay.< /review>

Classes are good. The registration is crappy and owners are not willing to make it more convenient. You need to fill form online and next come in person to submit the payment. You need to come in the specific day, depending whether you are an existing or a new customer. Last time I came after the work, making half an hour loop just to learn that because my son did not attend summer classes, we are not qualified to be existing customers and I need to come to pay next week... Really "great" customer experience.<//review>

It’s a hit or miss experience, as everything depends on the instructor. We got lucky as our first instructor Brandon was amazing. The second time not so much. Every parent in our batch complained but no action. One thing that Calphin staff doesn’t tell you at the time of enrollment is that they would not advance you to the next level till the child is 4+ years of age. So if you enroll early, be ready to be in the same class.< /Text>

<Text>Today i saw a very dispassionate , inconsiderate and heartless side of calphin staff fremont.I was unwell last week and my husband was out of town and we explained the reason when we called last week to get another available schedule and the calphin employee gave us friday ( Wednesday is our once a week schedule). We attended friday class last week and happily went to our Wednesday class which was today as per our normal scheduled time but a shocker  came when we had to meet a very rude female holding a charter.my son kept asking her where his class is and she could not find his name in the roster.in the meanwhile my daughter  saw her instructor and the rude lady let her pass and we started looking for my sons name.after a min i along with my son went to the reception to inquire about the missing entry.i was then told that the timings are now changed to friday but this was not informed neither verbally when we had requested for one time change nor via an email.we were just trying to make sense of this while the rude lady was bringing or dragging my daughter holding her like a prisoner while this 4 year old was crying mercifully  and was just asking her to let her take slippers but this lady did not care a least bit.my daughter puked there twice because she got so scared of how she was being treated.she was pulled out of pool.. dragged from her arm...not even tried to listen what she was trying to say and handed over at the reception like we were some freeloaders in front of 20 parents waiting.I had very high regard of this place and the staff up until today when i realised this place is zero when it comes to teaching empathy to the staff who are dealing with small children day in day out.what is the point of opening a big center and you cant have your staff treat small children with respect, care and some love.SHAME ON YOU. I understand that there can be glitches in schedule and miscommunications from the staff but unruly behavior with kids is totally UNACCEPTABLE.< /Text>< pictures>

All the teachers do try their best to teach. We've been coming for years. One caveat, the front desk usually only has one staff before 12, so it's always busy in the mornings.< /Text>

Really hope can give them 0 star. I came here at 7:40 for pre test of our daughter and my friend's daughter. The guy in front desk Tom is very rude and let us waited for half an hour after the test and even said if you don't want to wait you can go to other swiming school. He said he runs the place and his name is Tom. Ha, that's why it is chaos there.
Updated: Owner contact us after reviewing the surveillance camera footage. Owner admit it's their fault and apologized to us.<//Review>

<Text>I cancelled a class for my son and assume that they will give credit. But later they said they cannot find any information for the cancellation from their system and cannot give any credit. So if you have to cancel a class for your kid to wait to register later, make sure you get proof from them about your cancellation and keep the proof.</Text><gmap_id>0x808fbe291628fd41:0x39cc58ce524b883a<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<pics>None</pics><Review>After several attempts to give some feedback to Calphin, I was finally able to discuss with some of their managers the concerns that I have about their pedagogical methods, which I really appreciate.

Coach Wang and coach Jay went beyond what's usually seen from a coach in a class to help my child progress to the next level.<//Review><UserId.>112431179626189513499</UserId.><Date>1370583037568<//Date>< Rating>

<Date>1549937258916</Date><Rating>1< /Rating><review>I recently enrolled my kids, prebubbler(3 yr old) and bubbler (6yrs old) .  My kids have been swimming since they were 18mos old at American Swim Academy in Fremont. The reason we moved to Calphin is because it is closer to our home.  I wished I read the reviews before transfering my kids. Both of them were put to the class that is below their levels. The pre bubbler all they teach is play, blow bubbles and walk in the walls. My son learned that technique when he was  2 yrs old. I am not saying that my kids are advance but definitely their swimming skills are better than the level they are in now.  I guess they want your kids to progress slower so can they can make money out of you.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

The question is not if, but when a tragedy involving a child or children will occur in the parking lot near the entrance of Calphin Aquatic Club in Fremont if one has not occurred already. I have witnessed young excited swimmers darting to-and-from the tanks as parent drivers and Motel 6 guests speed to-and-from the facilities seemingly without any regard to the safety of the youth. There are also vehicles backing blindly out of parking spaces. What a recipe for disaster exists here at Calphin Aquatic Club. There should be serious safety instructon for the parents and children regarding this dangerous condition. Responsible authorative safety spotters should be stationed outside the entrance of this pool building at all times during busy hours just like the lifeguards must standby the pools. The ignored "Student Crossing" sign should be at least 4x8 feet in size and well lit for the even worse situation after sunset. I am helping out with a large estate, and I have been a long-term Motel 6 guest. My one star rating is not based on the quality of the swimming program, but on the apparent failure of pool management to solve this spine-tingling hazard placing children at a very scary safety risk. What a poorly engineered facility entrance that should be on the opposite side of the structure with a mandatory safe supervised pick-up and drop-off zone away from the vehicle traffic flow. If a fatality has not occurred, then a miracle is in progress at this location. But something must be done immediately so blood is not on the hands of pool management one day and the directors will not have to live on with the horrible remorse for the remainder of their respective lives.
Please take my concerns in a positive spirit as from where I sit it certainly appears you might have a great program at Calphin Aquatic Club!!!

CONS - The front desk is terrible. Too much crowd in the pool and in the waiting area. The owners should focus on improving the overall experience like improving the facility, getting rid of silly policies and  train the front desk. They can get rid of the gym and use the space to increase the waiting/shower area. A coat of paint on a rusted door will help. Obviously it will cost some.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>The students not given more attention when crowded. One coach teaching 6-7 students or they keep changing helpers they don't understand the level of students. Helpers start over again it wastes time. Only positive is 1 hr class where other school offers only 30 mins.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

< review>
I signed up for a quarter swim class and went to 6 classes so far. There has been 5 instructors. The first time was a replacement for teacher Jessica, the second time was Jessica, the third time another replacement because Jessica quit! The problem with replacement is that they don't teach because it's not their class thus not their responsibility . I called to protest that instructor switches too frequently and I didn't learn anything. They told me that they had a new teacher and the new teacher is going to stay till the end of the course. The new teacher is Jimmy and he was there for the fourth and fifth class. He is a nice teacher and I learned something. However the 6th class there was another replacement and I didn't learn anything again! For 6 classes and I had 5 different teachers! This is just not tolerable and I felt like total waste of time and money !</review>

They are good at teaching class, but one thing that I am not satisfied is that their registration system is soooo outdated and if you have credit on your account, you have to REMEMBER to use it! The staff will not automatically apply it on the tuition........ time to upgrade to new system, calphin</text>

< Review>
I chipped one of my front teeth when I was little and the filling over time had started to discolor. Dr. Cole did an amazing job fixing my tooth to make the filling look like one natural tooth! I was so excited I took photos to send to my friends (and now will share with internet strangers)! Her assistant Heather was also incredible.
Dr. Cole is also incredibly gentle and I did not feel a thing. If anyone is nervous about pain, needles, or the dentist in general, she is the dentist you need to see! Thank you Dr. Cole!!!<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Dr. Chase was incredible!!!! 5 stars for him and 5 stars for Dr. Hada and his entire team. They were super friendly and thoughtful. My dental Assistant Chris was always looking to make me more comfortable. Dr. Chase squeezed me in to his busy schedule because I had a broken filling and he wanted to make sure it was addressed quickly. This was my first time using Dr. Chase. In the past I had problems staying numb. I told him this and he assured me I wouldn’t feel anything. His goal was my well-being—always making sure I wasn’t in pain and going above and beyond to do-so. I was at peace the entire time, and they even have Netflix to watch and listen to during the procedure.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

BEST DENTAL EXPERIENCE EVER! Today I had my first phase appointment for veneers. Dr Hada and his assistants Anna and April made sure my experience was comfortable the entire time. I never felt the shot either!! My temporaries look and feel AMAZING. If you want an exceptional dental experience or are afraid of the dentist, you must go to Hada Family Dental. If you want a beautiful smile, go to Hada Family Dental.< /review>

<Review>Dr. Carlston is currently doing my ortho treatment and I couldn’t be happier!! My teeth are moving faster than I anticipated and I’m seeing amazing results just 15 weeks in. He’s been there every step of the way and checks in frequently to see how it’s going which I appreciate. I’ve never felt so comfortable in a dental office before. He’s the best!< /Review><Name>Christina Valdez</Name>< Gmap_id>

Cori gave me the most thorough cleaning I ever experienced. She also was very informative regarding my overall dental care. Dr. Carlston was excellent in terms of explaining my dental treatment. I very highly recommend Hada Family Dental.< /review>

My recent dental visit to HFD was a treat; my family and I highly recommend Dr. Cole.  She is amazing, knowledgeable, and truly makes you feel comfortable. Very professional, with great chair manner, and attention to detail. Her delivery of local anesthesia was so gentle and felt very reassured during my treatment. At Hada Family Dental, one feels welcome and appreciated.  Thanks to the entire friendly staff for making a visit to the dentist such an enjoyable experience!</text>

Absolutely impressed with Hada Family Dental and Kelley!!! Wonderful experience from the start. Took my 3 year old daughter for her very first dentist visit and Kelley couldn't have been more perfect! She made my daughter feel comfortable and happy right away and had zero issues hopping on the chair to get her teeth cleaned and first check up! Kelley explained everything in a very toddler friendly way! So please by the office environment as well. Very clean and front desk assistants were excellent! Looking forward to.cpming back in a couple of weeks for my first visit!<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I went to Hada Family Dental during my holiday break from university. Even though the office was busy, Cori stayed during her lunch hour to clean my teeth (which I haven’t gotten done in a while) before I went back to school out of state.
The office is very clean and welcoming. Also, I was able to watch Netflix while getting my teeth cleaned!! I felt so relaxed and refreshed after Cori cleaned my teeth. I would definitely recommend and will definitely be coming back. Thanks Cori! :)< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>We love Hada Family Dental! We’ve been going there for 7+ years now. I love the new office. It’s beautiful! The location is also great. There is a flat courtyard outside where my kids can ride scooters while waiting, plus a Starbucks next door for me. My kids love the TV and headphones while getting worked on. They love the prize bin at the end even more. Dr. Hada  is the nicest and most trustworthy person you will ever meet, plus you can tell he’s dedicated to his work. We always feel important and cared for by all the staff. Our favorite hygienist is Cori. She has a beautiful smile that will motivate you to floss more and is great with kids.< /Text>< Pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>The BEST Dentist experience.  I've visited many dental offices growing up in the past but by far the staff at Dr. Hada's office has been truly amazing.  Carol and Tori go above and beyond to make sure you feel cared for and make you feel like your apart of their family.  I can't say more about how great they are and how much I enjoy seeing Dr. Hada.  If you're a new patient and never had a positive experience at a dentist, you will 100% here!<//text>< pictures>

Was referred to Hada Family Dental by friends when I broke a molar (never mooch the last handful of popcorn, you'll surely pay)...
Dr Cole and Sarah took amazing care of me. Highly professional, yet warm and kind enough to ease the anxiety of a genuine dental-chicken like me. From the front office staff through all the clinicians, this practice is top notch. I'm an operating room RN locally, so cleanliness and technique are paramount to me. Hada Family Dental has a spotless office and treatment areas, and I am very impressed by the quality of the patient care they deliver. I cannot recommend them highly enough. ..Thanks for taking such great care of me.<//Text>

Had the most wonderful dental experience I've ever had with Dr Carlston. Zero painful moments and was so helpful in my dental care options designed for me. The Hada Family dental facility and staff will actually make you excited for your next appointment!</review>

<Review>Been looking for a dentist I could trust. Was recommended Hada Family Dental with Dr. Chase Carlston. I have had a new patient exam, two cleanings and had three teeth worked on. I have brought my kids and wife to Dr. Carlston because my experience has been hands down the best dental experience I have ever had.

If you are looking  for a place for your kids this is the guy.

If you are looking for someone for your wife because she might be embarrassed, this is the man.

If you need someone who knows what they are doing and want someone you trust. I have one person I would recommend. Dr. Chase Carlson and his v whole staff of amazing, nice, helpful, and friendly.

I love the text reminder of appointments and the affordable pricing.</Review>< Time>

I do not like going to the dentist, and have avoided it for some time. I recently went to @hadafamilydental in Mission Viejo and had an amazing experience. Not only was the office clean and organized, everyone was super nice and helpful. I unfortunately had some cavities after so long away but they all made the experience as easy as possible. Cori Salazar was my dental hygienist and did an incredible job. She was patient, and kind as she educated me on how to create better habits at home. I could not recommend a better dental hygienist or dentist!< /review>

A friendly experienced staff that takes excellent care of their patient's. The office is beautifully decorated with modern appointments that make coming to the dentist very relaxing. I recommend any of the doctors in this practice all of them are friendly and gentle. I'm so glad that we were referred to this office several years ago.</review>

After avoiding the dentist for roughly 3 years Hada Family Dental welcomed me with open arms. It was my first experience with them and I ended up having to return multiple times. Dr. Cole was very informative and ensured that I knew what was happening every step of the process. Lizzie, her assistant was an absolute DOLL and was so sweet. She remembered me when I returned for a visit and I was so impressed with her continuously sunny disposition. Dental work is never fun, but since hygiene is important I can't recommend Hada Dental enough.<//text>

My Hada Family Dental experience is always great. Their staff are professional yet down to earth and super nice. Especially, Amber, she is by far the absolute best dental assistant I have ever come across. She explains everything clearly and makes sure you understand the next step, she has a beautiful personality and is easy on the eyes if you know what I mean. Dr. Cole and Amber make a great team. I highly recommend Hada Family Dental!< /Review>

I love these people! Their positive energy radiates throughout the office. Besides their energy, the doctors and dental assistants are up to date on the latest techniques and use the latest technology to treat their patients. I felt like I was treated with so much respect and professionalism. I had some treatment planned and they were so understanding. This is the most important take away. They never push for the most profitable treatment. They really understand that you are a patient, not just a customer and plan your treatment accordingly.<//text>

Dr. Hada is very skilled and extremely talented when it comes to making your teeth look and feel good. I knocked my teeth out snowboarding, and got composite veneers by another dentist 15 years ago. While they held up as good as they could, I decided I needed to get my teeth fixed. I've lived in 8 different states  and I had previously had a consultation with at a well known cosmetic dentist in Utah, as well as other dentists in other states. I was referred to Dr Hada by my friend after seeing her flawless smile, and I decided to get a flight from Utah to California to get a consultation with Dr. Hada. Not only is Dr Hada very personable but he has an attention to detail and knows what will look good and how to achieve it. I decided to fly back down to California and get my teeth fixed! Dr Hada was the one I felt would do the best job and he did. I Needed 2 crowns and 4 veneers on my front top teeth. I am extremely pleased with the results! I'm also extremely picky, so I drag my feet making decisions but hands down I would recommend Hada Family Dental to anyone and everyone! In or out of state. Plus the procedure was nearly painless. Dr. Hada and his staff especially Amanda who was his assistant during my appointment were very good about making sure I was comfortable. He's very particular about making sure the color is correct, the shape, and your bite lining up. As well as making sure your other teeth and gums stay healthy.  I was nervous but looking back realizing I probably should not have been nervous. I just can't say enough good things about this dental practice! I believe my before and after photos might be on the website soon. He will also go out of his way to check on you if you had any major dental work. He works with kids and is great with them. He truly has passion in what he does! His dental assistants are so kind. I will continue to fly down to California to use Hada Family Dental for our dental needs! Thank you guys so much!!<//text>

I love Hada dental!  The staff is so friendly. Dr. Hada is friendly, knowledgeable, and honest. He let me know of any issues, and what I need to do to prevent things from getting worse. Kelley is such a wonderful hygienist. She is friendly, and efficient. I overloaded her with questions, and she had answers and advice to help me with my teeth sensitivity among other things. I will look no further for a dentist or hygienist.< /Review>

Had a dental cleaning from Dental Hygienist Julie Canning. She is fantastic! Very personable and easy to talk to. I and my teeth always appreciate her excellent work. Dr. Hada came in for my check up & he was great as usual . . . friendly and professional. Thoroughly checked my teeth, gums and x-rays. No cavities. Looking forward to my next visit in 6 months. I would highly recommend Dr. Hada and his staff. From the front office staff to the back office staff, everyone is great! They are moving to a brand new, state-of-the-art office next month. Excited to see the new build out</Text>

Every time I come here the staff is amazing. Really friendly and genuinely care about how you are and what's going on in your life. Going to the dentist isn't necessarily a "fun" experience but Dr. Hada and his staff make it the best experience it can be. All the assistants, especially Amanda, are great. I needed a lot of work done in the back of my teeth, from crowns to fillings, and they made it seem easy and  smooth. Dr. Hada knows what he is doing and knows how to treat his patients. Not to mention my teeth feel 100 times better. I look forward to getting my teeth to be amazing with Dr. Hada and Hada Family Dental.< /Review>

I recently had my teeth cleaned by Kelley, my dental hygienist, and had an amazing experience! She is so gentle and caring. I also had work done by Dr. Cole who did an outstanding job and gave me the best treatment. Amber, her dental assistant, is so sweet and thorough with her explanations. My experience there was 5 stars to say the least! Dr. Hada, I felt the great energy of your office staff and will surely recommend it to all of my family and friends!< /Review>

<name>Jon Clarke</name><review>Dr. Hada and his staff always provide a great dental experience (if there is such a thing!).  His staff are extremely friendly and always try to accommodate special circumstances and requests.  Dr. Hada takes the time to clearly explain what is going on and what he thinks the best treatment will be.  Best thing is, you feel like you are getting the straight story from him - that he cars about your dental health and that he is only suggesting care that will make you feel better. Trust is super important (I have to admit I have had a few questions with other dentists I have seen) and I have always felt secure that he is concerned first and foremost on what is best for me.< /review><time>1491348480855< /time><Pics>None< /Pics>< GmapID>

10+ years and after cracking a tooth on a particularly hard almond, the repair work was exception, even by their standards.  The bedside manners cannot be beat.  That evening after the procedure, the Doctor checked up on me.  I feel that they hire by skill AND character.  Hands down, the best treatment and care is from Hada Family Dental.< /Review>

<review>Everyone at Hada Family Dental was friendly and professional. The ladies at the front desk, our hygienist Julie, assistant Eber, and dentist Dr Cole were all super nice and took great care of my teeth.
I brought my 3 year old for his first visit and they made him feel right at home. He loved watching cartoons with the headphones and getting his bag of treats at the end. Julie was great about showing him the tools and counting his teeth. He can't wait to go back.<//review>< pics>

< review>
I absolutely love this office! My experience at Hada Family Dental has exceeded all expectations. Dr. Hada and Dr. Cole are amazing dentists who truly care about their patients. I recently had my teeth straightened by Dr. Hada with braces for my upcoming wedding and I am so thrilled with how straight and perfect they look! He was able to perfect my smile in such a short period of time and made sure to have them off just in time for my bridal shower!
Dr. Cole has done a few fillings on me which were completely painless procedures! She has also done some dental work on my mom, who has very high dental anxiety, and made her feel so comfortable the entire time. That was the first time I have ever seen my mom leave a dentist office smiling!
The assistants always go above and beyond to make you feel extremely comfortable and the front office staff make you feel like family when you walk in the door.
If you are in search of a great dentist office, Hada Family Dental will not disappoint!</review>

<review>Had a great experience here! I woke up constantly for multiple nights with a bad toothache! Like serious dizzying pain... I decided to go in to see Cori (my dental hygienist. Go see her, she’s amazing) to see if an old cavity was to blame.  I expected some long expensive procedure. To my amazement Dr Carlston said he would have me fixed in about 5 minutes!  Apparently the last dentist I had, didn’t level out a crown and when I chew it puts kore pressure on my gums where that crown is. A little fine sanding down later and I was all good!  I can’t believe I have had that issue for years!  So happy! Thank you Cori and thank you Dr Carlston.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

< Review>
What an outstanding office!
Jill, (hygienist) is amazing!!
So gentle and professional, with a wonderful personality! Rita, (front desk) was a doll in helping us with our dental insurance.
Oh, and the office was was
beautiful, spotless and well organized!
And finally there’s Dr. Hada, without a doubt the very best! He was a joy of a Dr., and the greatest as a person. Really easy to connect with and gave us a very enjoyable dental experience. Dr. Hada has very professional dental ethics and caring towards our dental health. He pointed out some concerns, that needed to be watchful of. Not once did he push or rushed anything that didn’t need to be done. Dentistry can be so foreign and confusing, especially if you don’t know what really is true. Not to mention terrifying.
From the moment I walked in till the very last goodbye, my husband and I were treated so wonderful!
I’m so happy to have found the perfect dental office!
Thanks everyone at Hada Family Dental!
See you soon.<//Review>

<Text>I needed an urgent appointment to get begin my treatment before May 14. The front desk staff, Rita and team, are very cordial and did everything necessary to fit me in and secured a May 11 early morning appointment with Dr Cole. Dr Cole was phenomenal. She made sure that everything is done with utmost care and close to perfection. Sarah, the assistant,has just the right touch. She made sure also that the impressions and temporary crowns done were perfectly! Sarah has just the perfect touch and i told her she would be a very good dentist herself.  My entire family have been going to Hada Dentistry since we moved to the area in late 2013. Our experience has been great ever since.  The funny part was with Dr Hada and my husband. My husband told me that he fell asleep - literally probably close to snoring - while Dr Hada was working on his teeth. That's how much we trust these folks.</Text><Response>None</Response>< rating>

<Text>My Dentist Dr Cole was amazing, I have always been a little afraid to go to the Dentist and she went out of way to make me feel comfortable. She and her assistant Amber  are amazing, they don't make you feel like your a number but they go out of there way to let you know they see you as a person. The thing I loved the most is that Dr Cole and Amber explained everything they were doing step by step because they knew I was scared. I will be returning and feel very comfortable doing so. Thanks Dr Cole and Amber You guys are the best and make a great team.</Text>< Rate>

The office is comfortable and relaxed, each station has its own TV to make your visit as enjoyable as possible. Dr. Hada and the hygienists are friendly and professional and the front office is very helpful, especially Lynn who has been great with all of my insurance and billing questions. I highly recommend this office!<//Review>< Pictures>

I am currently 5 months pregnant and was extremely worried about a dentist still pushing X-rays so was very careful in where I chose to go. After reading many, many reviews and asking for recommendations on the local Facebook group, Hada Family Dental was recommended and I decided to schedule. In addition to me being pregnant, I am also diagnosed with Hyperemesis gravidarum. HG is a pregnancy complication that is characterized by severe nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and possibly dehydration. Feeling faint may also occur so I was very worried about a simple teeth cleaning as I cannot even hold water down at this moment. Upon checking in, I threw up 3 times in the bathroom and was worried I might have to reschedule. The staff advised me that ironically, 5 of the staff are pregnant including my dental hygienist, Cori Salazar, RDH. It made me feel more comfortable regarding my care so I moved forward with the appointment and it was truly the best experience I could've had given my situation. I think I was a hard patient as my nausea was constant and I had to keep getting up to take a minute so I don't throw up, but Cori was absolutely nothing less than exemplary. She was so professional, so courteous and so understanding that I was in utter disbelief. She took her time cleaning my teeth and let me take as many breaks as possible, even if that meant keeping me after they close. She even offered to split the cleaning appointment into two if it was too much for me to handle at once. I have never received such amazing service as this in my life. Not to mention, I was provided with a business card to call at any time I needed to, even after hours, in case I had any concerns at all. Now that is service that I will keep coming back for. My husband and son will be coming in for an appointment soon and I am very confident that we will be lifetime clients of Hada Family Dental. Superb experience!<//text>

Doc Hada and his staff are excellent! I have been going to him since he moved to this office and he has not only treated me correctly but is an all around nice guy. His office staff is outstanding to mention only a few... Rita does wonders getting and explaining everything needed no finical surprises. As for helpers Bri and amber are funny, efficient and a pleasure to be around doing outstanding work and are in tuned with Dr. Hada. I will say a well oiled machine! :)</Review>

Tori and Brianne have both cleaned my teeth at this practice and they are excellent! Thorough, patient, and kind. Dr. Hada re-did an implant crown that I had completed over 12 years ago and I am thrilled with the results! This is a very kind dental office, they explain everything very well and you don't feel like a stranger when you come back through the door. Definitely recommend this office to people of all ages!!</review>

<Text>I have been to a few dentists in the area after my long time dentist retired. I am so glad that I was referred to Dr. Hada from someone at my gym who heard me complaining about trying to find a good dentist. Not only did I find a good one, I am pretty sure that I have found the best. I can go into great detail on this. However, let me just say that these guys are on the forefront of technology and are super friendly. I actually love going to this office which I have NEVER said about any dentist. I really like Amber who is his assistant. She is so attentive to her patients needs. She is a great gal that is on top of her profession. She really works well in conjunction with supporting Dr. Hada to make sure that they deliver a great experience. Just like magic! Yes, I did just say that about a dentist office!? Go check them out. Just don't book them up too much! I still need to get in! : )<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>What a great experience! Carol greeted us so warmly as soon as we walked in the door. Julie took such care reassessing our young son who was told by another office that he needed an excessive amount of dental work. She and Dr. Hada agreed that was not the case. How refreshing to come to a practice and receive traditional, honest and friendly dental care instead of the aggressive "you need a ton of work" type.
Thank you!< /Text>< pictures>

I recently visited the office for the first time and the facility is beautiful, clean, and very well run. My hygienist Kelley was extremely gentle, but very thorough and my teeth have felt great since my visit. Kelley, as well as the rest of the staff, made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I will absolutely go back to Kelley and I am excited to make this my family office!<//review>

I suffer from chronic white-trash teeth syndrome (known as WTTS) and have been plagued with its symptoms since I was very young. The major self-induced side effects including persistent Mt. Dew rinses, Skoal Bandits, and shouting at those of a different skin-tone have done their toll on my mouth. After doing a genealogy report based on my DNA I learned my ancestors played a game called “who can inbreed the most” which also didn’t help how my teeth formed. Seriously. If there was reality TV back then they easily could have started a new show called Wife/Sister and lasted multiply seasons. The only royalty my family line has ever experienced are the 4 crowns I have in my mouth. Frankly, these teeth are a joke. If not for Dr. Cole at Hada Family Dental and her patience, skill and psychological prowess, I’m sure I’d be gumming my way through another bag of hot Cheetos or yelling at more Irishmen. She and her staff were confident in their ability to tackle this travesty of a mouth and I came out looking like a million bucks. I can’t fix the rest of the garbage dump that is my family, but at least Hada Family Dental could fix my teeth!<//text>

I was referred to Dr. Hada by a family member when I complained about having to get a root canal. I visited Dr. Hada and was impressed by his professionalism and his kindness. His staff got me in right away and were easy to work with. I went back in for the root canal being pretty nervous as anyone should be for this procedure. Hada took great care of me. The worst part for me is the numbing shot and he walked me through it and I didn't feel a thing. During the entire time I could tell he was making sure I was happy and comfortable. He did a quality job and I didn't have to spend my whole day there. Very impressed. Afterward he explained everything that he did and told me how to prevent it. His assistant took great care of me as well and I actually enjoyed going to the dentist. I definitely would refer anybody I talk to Hada Family Dental! Thanks guys!< /review>

This is the best dental office I have ever been to, without a doubt.  I went in for a simple cleaning and will definitely go back for any future dental needs.  The hygienist was incredibly gentle to the point that I almost didn't realize my teeth were being cleaned, but the before and after pictures I saw were amazing and showed how thorough of a cleaning I received!  Dr. Hada goes to great lengths to ensure everyone feels comfortable in his office, he even has TVs in each room so patients can watch the news or the game so they can relax.  This is the place I would take my family based upon the quality of work and the way Dr. Hada and his staff treat their patients.  You can bet I'll be back in 6 months for my next cleaning!</Text>

Wow!!! What staff and awesome dentist! I was treated so well from the moment they called to confirm my appointment, to the time I walked through the front door, from the time I sat down to get my dental work and they even followed up with a phone call later that day to make sure I was doing well. It is so nice to have a dentist in our community who cares. Thank you Dr. Hada and team for a great experience.< /review>

Wow!! I am so grateful for Hada family dental. They really went above and beyond to take care of my daughter!!!

Our little girl came hole from school complaining of some pain near one of her bacK teeth. We inspected the area and noticed a small bump on her gum. We didn’t think much of it, until later when we were out at dinner. She stated to complain more and more and the pain became so unbearable that she could not eat. By this time, it was just past 7:00 pm and my wife and I were worried that we would have to wait until the morning to be seen by a dentist. I reached out to the team at Hada Family Dental who immediately informed us to come down to their office.

We were greeted by the front office staff who were prepared for our arrival. Dr. Hada had called his team and informed them that we were on our way into the office. We were immediately brought back and greeted by the dental assistant. She took some x-rays and went and got Dr. Carlston.

Dr. Carlston was amazing! He took the time to talk with our little girl and was so incredibly perfect with her. Our little girl was nervous that she was going to be in more pain. Dr. Carlston could tell by our little girl’s body language that she was nervous. He got down on her level and told her that if she felt anything, she could punch him in the arm. This simple little joke lightened her anxiety and made her much more comfortable. He was phenomenal.

The whole team at Hada Family Dental knew exactly what our little girl needed. They took the time and showed how much they cared. They even put some Chapstick on her little chapped lips to help her be more comfortable. I was so impressed that they stayed after hours to help our little girl get out of pain. I cannot say enough about Hada Family Dental and would highly recommend them to anyone needing dental services.<//Text>

Doctor Hada is by far the most genuine and nicest dentist I've ever seen. He is very sincere and he truly cares about his work and patients. If your looking for an honest dentist, this is the place for you. They always exceeded my expectations. Everyone in his office is also very kind and they always treat me with up most respect especially Amber, she’s a sweetheart. After seeing Dr. Hada I will never see another dentist again. They continue to keep a smile on my face!!<//Review>

<review>Dr. Hada is personal, professional and excellent at what he does. Our entire family loves going to the dentist because of him. Just last week our 5 year old needed two fillings and sat relaxed and comfortable while Dr. Hada took care of it.  We have all had great experiences and will continue going to him in the years to come.<//review><response>{'time': 1495812938277, 'text': 'Thank you very much for taking the time and leaving your positive feedback.

<review>It is hard to find a dentist office where everyone that works there treats you like a human being! Hada Family Dental has some amazing staff who listen to their patients and are down to earth. I received excellent care in their office, and I think anyone who tries them out will enjoy their dental experience too.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Date>1503514916892</Date><rate>5< /rate><review>I have known Dr. Hada for almost 5 years. We have mutual patients and I have always heard great things about his practice and staff. I went for the first time to have some major work done this past month.  I had seven fillings redone and a crown placed. Dr. Hada is a perfectionist and was extremely thorough throughout the 3 visits I had with him to complete the work. He has a great personality, makes you feel comfortable and is a very honest person. It is really difficult to find a dentist who isn't a salesperson but genuinely cares about providing quality care in an ethical manner.

Julie, his dental hygienist, was very thorough, pleasant and did a great job on my cleaning. Dr. Hada's staff is very knowledgeable, well trained and very friendly. The office itself is very clean.

I highly recommend Dr. Hada!<//review>< pics>

Describe my experience? I don't know that I've ever felt less pain and more overall comfort at the dentist in my entire life. I have been told that I have pretty rock solid teeth, so a root canal seemed more scary than getting all 4 wisdom teeth out at the same time. Dr. Hada has a steady and skilled hand, and his ability to explain and carry out the procedure, gave me a comfort that I didn't know I could feel. I certainly enjoyed watching whatever I wanted during the whole process as well. If there was a sixth star, I would have given him another. Thanks Doc!</text>

<text>For me: Dr. Cole and her team are awesome! Full disclosure, I am not the greatest patient, in fact I'm a wreck in the chair and Dr. Cole and her team have been supportive and patient. I chose to start seeing Dr. Cole after I took my son in for a dental emergency. Dr. Cole has made sitting in the chair manageable. All of the work I've had done is excellent. Julie is my hygienist and she is also patient and caring and I'm so grateful for her. Julie is a pro! Rita, Carol, and Lynne are the amazing front office staff. They are all very pleasant and are extremely knowledgeable about insurance billing.  I give Dr. Cole and her team the highest recommendation.
For my son: Dr. Cole was able to work with my son, who has heightened anxiety & other medical issues, during a dental emergency. She referred us to the best Endo and got the plan in motion to get him out of pain. Carol and Rita were able to provide coordination between three doctors! My son is now out of pain and he loves Dr. Cole.  He went from being terrified of the dentist to loving his dentist...highest recommendation.</text>< Pictures>

<text>I had a great experience here! It had been over a year since I had my last teeth cleaning, so I was a bit nervous it would be a painful process after so much time had passed.  Fortunately, however, I had an excellent dental hygienist - Kelley!  Kelley did a great job carefully cleaning my teeth, offering expert advice on how to keep my teeth clean and healthy, and was a very friendly professional who talked me through the procedures she was performing.  It was also the first time I experienced NO PAIN during a dental procedure...Thank you, Kelley!<//text>< UserId.>

Just after returning from vacation I had a MAJOR cavity in my mouth and needed to have it removed right away. They not only went out of there way to get me in to see the doctor ,but because of Dr Cole  it was the best experience with a dentist in a long time. She has really restored my faith in American dentist.Dr Cole is amazing and her assistant. Greg Nysewander Dana Point<//Review>

Plus, my chair was ready for me at my appointment time (no wait!). Dr. Cole showed me my X-rays and gave me a thorough explanation of why treatment was needed.  She then explained to me the types of treatment options that were available, their pros and cons, and gave her recommendation. I felt confident trusting in her expertise, especially when she had taken the time to go over my options so I could make an informed decision. Having been to dentists that don't explain the problem and jump right into scheduling for treatment, this was a really pleasant experience.  Thank you Hada Family Dental!< /Review>< Pics>

Dr. Cole was very nice and easy to talk with about some issues which were being watched per my chart notes made by Dr. Hada. I needed to have a few fillings redone, and Dr. Cole amd Amber were able to fit me in later that day to return for the dental work. Speaking with Dr. Cole put me at ease like I was speaking with Dr. Hada - they are very similar and put you at ease with your concerns.

<text>I have been going to Hada Family Dental and seeing Dr. Hada and his amazing staff for the last few years. I needed a ton of work done in preparation for braces. In my life I have had surgeries, root canals, fillings, deep cleanings, you name it, I've had it done to my teeth and have had not so many great experiences in the past.

Dr. Hada came into my life and changed my entire perspective on the dental industry and experience. He is so thorough and detailed in his explanations without being medical so that I understand just what he is doing both before and after procedures. He is compassionate in his work and respects both mine and his time. He has gained my complete trust and I have recommended people to his practice as I would you. And might I add the most important part....I have never once felt any of the injections he has given, lol. Honest.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Dr. Hada and his team are prolific and make every visit a great experience with their friendly, and impeccable service coupled with genuine enthusiasm. Dr. Hada will give you the thorough run through on the procedures that will be done during your appointment which then guides you to the whats, whys and wheres of the dental procedure. Again he and his team are the best at what they do.< /Review>

I have never taken the time out of my day to write a review for a doctor, but Dr. Hada and his team are above and beyond that I felt I should share. You can tell that Dr. Hada loves what he does because he goes out of his way to help his patients. I have really bad TMJ and he helped me get a mouth guard. He let me come back as many times as I needed to adjust my mouth guard. Also, he is very honest. I have had other dentists tell me I needed work done when I really didn't. Dr. Hada has said that I can just keep an eye on things instead of jumping to do work. The rest of his team is awesome as well! Everyone is super friendly. I give this practice 5 stars!<//Review>

This is my second review. Dr. Hada and his staff are amazing. Please see my other review. This review is for Dr. Cole and her assistant Sarah. I had a crown prep done today and the both of them were amazing. They worked very well together. I was blown away. You cannot go wrong here. Dr. Cole is amazing. Sarah is amazing.</Text>

I had a great experience at the office today. The staff, and Dr. Hada were very welcoming. I had a portion of my lingual bar replaced, and everything feels back to normal. Throughout the procedure, they discussed the work they would do, prior to carrying it out. I feel he is a very knowledgable Doctor, and feel I would refer my close friends and family to his office.< /text>

I went in recently to have my semi-annual cleaning and was thoroughly pleased as I have been in the past.  All of the staff were warm and welcoming, competent and thorough.

We've recommended many friends and neighbors and they have all expressed their gratitude for the referral.</text>

<Text>Having moved around alot and not having inherited the best teeth, I've had a lot of experience with dentists over the years. It's not my favorite thing to go to the dentist. But Dr. Hada and his staff are so easy to work with. I don't wait too long and the dentistry is excellent. Dr. Hada is a warm, kind, detail-oriented dentist. He is the most gentle dentist I've ever been to. And I feel very confident about his skills. He has made a sub-par smile into a spectacular smile. He is honest and very skilled. What more could you ask for? I don't dread going to the dentist anymore!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I heartily recommmend Dr. Hada and his family practice for the care and attention given to every patient. All the staff make one feel at home with care and attention which help with nervousness which many of us have at times!. In this practice, a patient is part of the family and not a number. The front office staff make great efforts to accommodate busy schedules in a pleasant and professional manner, and as the first point of contact, are an excellent reflection of the practice.</Review>

Dr Hada is absolutely without a doubt hands down the best dentist!
I used to see my local family dentist twice a year. Then it was sold & bought by another company. The last dentist, (before Dr Hada) I had a very, very bad experience. Swelling on right side, not able to chew, nothing hot/cold allowed on right side. Sharpe shooting pains. My husband knowing the pain I was in, told me about Dr Hada and asked that I just give Dr Hada a chance and for me to make my own opinion and judge for myself.  Hubby made the appointment (as I was stubborn and just done with dentist). Our (Dr Hada & Me) first meet-n-greet...I explained to Dr Hada about what happened to me with my last dentist. He was understanding, caring, patient and kind; but, more importantly he listened!  He Answered all my questions and concerns. He knew I was scared, nervous and I had major issues with eating on the right side and wasn't to fond of dentists.  Dr Hada sat down with me and took his time and explained everything in detail the step-by-step procedures until I felt comfortable. Appointment time 😳 ... I was extremely nervous (sorta shaking) when appointment time arrived (normal feeling). What took my last dentist (3) failed attempts to fix, to include a possible recommended tooth extraction (from last dentists 😳😡).
Dr Hada fixed it in less than an hour without a tooth extraction.😍 (The issue was merely a cap not sealed properly by last dentist.🙄)
I was extremely happy with the results. Let's just say for the first time in almost 1 1/2years I was able to actually eat on the right side without pain and/or discomfort. I have been going to Dr Hada ever since.
I highly, HIGHLY recommend Dr Hada to all my family and friends. He loves his patients, the staff are absolutely amazing, fun loving and make you feel wanted and welcomed. 😊
Dr Hada enjoys what he does. You see it not only in his work but also through his patients.
If you don't want to take my word; make an appointment with Dr Hada's office and make your own observation and judge for yourself - 😊  you will be happy- thank you again Dr Hada and staff...you guys are awesome and made it a lot more pleasant and trusting for me to go back to a dentist again 😍<//Review>

Best dental experience I've ever had. He is so gental and the hygienists are amazing. I had 3 fillings in one sitting with absolutely no pain, no shots, in and out very quickly.

WOW, Five Stars! I had a problem tooth and like many people I procrastinated until  the pain was too much.  I scheduled an appointment to have my tooth pulled.  I had had it.  Dr. Cole was able to save my tooth and at far less the cost than I expected. Dr. Cole and her associate Amber were AMAZING.  Super professional, super skilled, super easy to talk to.  I can't wait to go back. The two ladies at the front desk were amazing too. I'm sorry I forgot to get their names. The first time I went one of them stood up, welcomed me, and shook my hand. What's going on?  They're bending over backwards to provide a very positive experience, that's what's going on.  I told my wife and daughter and they'll be going soon. WOW., Five Stars!< /Review>

<Text>Have never been to a dental practice this welcoming. From the front desk staff through the hygienists to Dr. Hada, these guys know customer service. Referred here by a friend, and I'm so glad I gave them a look. I'm a pediatrician, and I'm so impressed with the gentle way I watched everyone interact with their patients. I don't love going to the dentist, but I'm almost looking forward to my next visit to Hada Family Dental.</Text>< pictures>

Dr. Cullen has been my dentist since I was 3 years old. My whole family has been seeing him for 20 plus years. He has become not only our dentist, but seems like a part of our family now. I have had both Aubrey and Brianne clean my teeth. They are both extremely gentle and do an amazing job. If you are looking for a new dentist, give the doctors and staff at Hada Family Dental a chance to be a part of your family!< /Text>

<Review>I was referred to Hada Family Dental from a dear friend of mine a little over a month ago. Friend referrals are the best -- super honest and extremely trustworthy. I am very particular with my overall dental health care and had yet to find a practice in OC that I genuinely liked. Personally, a dental hygienist makes or breaks my experience (they do all of the important work!) My friend couldn't stop raving about her dental hygienist, KELLEY!!! I knew I was overdue for a cleaning, so I booked an appointment with her immediately. When I scheduled my appointment I learned that Kelley's first available was a little over a month out. I was completely fine with that, in fact, I took it as a great sign. I want someone who is popular and busy.

This morning was my first appointment...The office is absolutely beautiful, immaculate, and state of the art. The front office personnel was warm and welcoming upon arrival (despite my tardiness). I had my new patient paper work and insurance information filled out in advance. The new patient forms are easily accessible on their website. So convenient!

My actual teeth cleaning with Kelley was a breeze. During my cleaning I watched television on a flat screen mounted to the ceiling (amazing) and kicked back in the comfortable oversized chair. Not only did Kelley make me feel extremely comfortable, but she thoroughly explained every single move she was making. She gave suggestions to improve gum health without lecturing and provided suggestions for preventative care. Kelley is a real gem and I could not be more grateful for the referral.
Her cleaning was meticulous and my teeth feel great. I HIGHLY recommend Kelley!! She's well worth the wait!< /Review>< pictures>

<text>OMG, ok I love going to the dentist...said no one ever!  Well, I can't say that I LOVE going to the dentist but I love this dental office staff and no longer fear going, now that I found Hada family dental office and just FYI I drive about 65 miles one way, I honestly look forward to going.  Let me just say that the staff there is AMAZING from the front office to the back office.  I recently had to have a bridge and it took a few visits and from the first visit to the last I had the pleasure of having the amazing duo of Dr. Cole, simply amazing dentist  and the awesome assistant Kimberly Jones, Kimberly has the ability to just make you calm and comfortable from start to finish and her knowledge and experience and the love for what she does just shines!  I am a forever patient of Hada Family Dental, thank you to all of you for providing and pleasant atmosphere and experience, I will recommend your office any chance I get< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I have been to many different dentists over the years and Dr. Hada is hands down the BEST dentist that I have been to. From the moment you walk into their office, you are greeted by their warm and friendly office staff. Dr. Hada is always smiling and ready to help you in any way he can.
I am someone who NEEDS a good dentist because I have a lot of work that needs to be done. Dr. Hada was very pragmatic and practical about approaching my most pressing issues first. He let me know honestly what needs to be done and what could wait. I respect and appreciate his openness and honesty in making his professional recommendations. In addition, his WORK is top notch. The work he has done has been the best that I have received (and I have had a lot of work done over the years).
Dr. Hada’s office staff are very friendly and helpful. I had a question about Dental Insurance and Dr. Hada had me sit down with Rita to go over various options. Rita was very thorough and extremely helpful in helping me understand what would be best for me regarding dental insurance coverages. I was grateful for the help in navigating something that can be very confusing.
I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Hada’s office and have nothing but great things to say about his team and his office.</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1495813017285, 'text': 'Thank you very much for taking the time and leaving your positive feedback.

I, like most people get anxiety going to the dentist, especially when the drill is involved. Dr. Hada was as smooth as butter, and my anxiety was gone within the first five minutes of the procedure, and yes, the dreaded drill was involved. I had two fillings replaced, which required two numbing shots, for that fun drill. I never felt pain, and Dr. Hada's assistant Kim was awesome. She talked me through the entire procedure explaining what Dr. Hada was doing. Great experience! Great Dr., great staff, great office!!< /Review>

<review>My 6 month cleaning appointment with Bri was absolutely fantastic! Though she had to give me a brief talking about better flossing in one area, she did it in the most personable way possible.  She was fun and gave me hope for an even better check up next time. All hygienist need a good role model like Bri to make the dentist visit enjoyable!!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1495752841548, 'text': 'Thank you very much for taking the time and leaving your positive feedback.

The whole office couldn't be more professional.  Dr. Hada is a master at administering local anesthesia.  He keeps apologizing for pain I never feel!!   I am always very comfortable with his diagnosis, recommendations, and treatment plan. I've been going to this office for years, and they treat me like family! I could not recommend this dental practice any higher than i do!!</review>

I have had many Root Canals, Fillings, Crowns, etc. done in my lifetime, and I've never felt more comfortable and safe with a dentist than I do with Hada Family Dental. Dr. Hada is one of the most honest and up front individuals I've ever had the pleasure of meeting and doing business with. He'll let you know if he thinks you don't need any work done, instead of other dentists who perform repair work when not needed.  I will never go to a different Dentist again. The day Dr. Hada retires, i'm getting wooden teeth as I'm not sure I trust any dentist like I trust him.  If you're on the fence about finding a new Dentist, you HAVE to give Hada Family Dental a shot. You won't be disappointed. I know i'm not.<//text>

< Review>
I recently went to Dr. Hada for a cleaning and while I was there it was discovered that I needed a filling replaced. When I came back for the replacement filling, some numbing was required. I was a little worried since injections aren't the most fun you can have at the dentist, but I didn't feel a thing! Dr. Hada and his staff were very careful about having topical numbing before the injection and Dr. Hada took his time administering the injections so that I didn't feel anything. The procedure also went perfectly! Would recommend to anyone looking for a dentist.</Review>

Dr. Carlston and his staff took such good care of me and I had a great experience at Hada Family Dental. I had a lot of work done and was fairly nervous, but Dr Carlston was very professional and helped me feel comfortable through the whole experience. Dr Carlston also followed up with me the next day to make sure I was doing well and he really went the extra mile to make my experience as pleasant as it could be. I will be returning and recommending this practice family and friends.< /text>

<review>I have been a patient of Dr. Hada's for the last year following my former dentist's retirement. During the last 12 months I have had general cleanings done as well as 3 crowns needed to be made recently. I continue to experience excellent service from Dr. Hada, as well as his staff from dental assistants Kim and Amanda, to front office staff Lynn, Rita and Carol. Dr. Hada and his dental assistants have shown great 'chair side manners' and keep you appropriately informed along the way on any major procedures that you are having done. There followup is also excellent with Dr. Hada available by phone after hours if the need arises. Dental work is not fun, but these individuals and others in Dr. Hada's office provide a calming and welcoming atmosphere, not to mention very good results. Jim M</review>< Rating>

I have always dreaded seeing the dentist.
But after a nagging tooth ache and some embarrassing discolration and cavity. I decided to go. Hada family dental is the only place i will be seen. The staff is warm and welcoming but what really made the trip bearable is Dr. Cole she is professional and personable which is a great combination. Dr. Cole eased my stress with her demeanor and personality. She was able to save my tooth from a a root canal. Most importantly she filled the cavity in my front teeth. Now i can smile without hesitation. Thank you Dr. Cole and everyone at Hada family dental.</Text>

Dr. Hada is the best dentist I've ever dealt with. I have acid reflux that can sometimes do a number on my teeth so I've seen a few dentists. After having several bad experiences elsewhere Rich has restored my trust in dentists. He is a master of his art from dental work to making sure you are 100% compfortable. All the staff is super friendly and accomodating.< /review>

If you want to go to a dental practice that takes care of you from the moment you walk through the door this is your place. All the staff (front office, RDA's, RDH's) are all so friendly and have ample experience so you know you're in good hands. Of course the owner, Dr. Hada, who is a family friend, is an exceptional Dentist!

Today for example I got an old silver filling taken out and it was replaced with white composite. Eber, the RDA, was very nice and numbed my gums prior to the maxillary nerve block shot. When Dr. Hada went in with the shot I didn't feel a thing! This is mostly due to the fact that he took his time to slowly release the numbing agent. I appreciated him putting my comfort level as a priority, most dentists probably wouldn't have taken the time to do that since they have many patients to see. He also walked me through what he was doing and made sure I was comfortable during the whole procedure. Its little things like that that make a huge difference in a dental visit. I am already looking forward to my next cleaning.

Call and make an appointment today, you will not regret it!< /review>

< Review>
This review is long overdue!  We have been going to Dr. Hada for many years, first at OC Dental Specialists then when we followed him to Hada Family Dental.

He is the most gentle, caring and patient dentist I have ever been to, and I have him to thank for restoring my smile and my sense of dignity.  I have had a lot of major work done, some of which was fixing what other dentists had done improperly, and I have to say he has been a godsend.

Everyone in the office is just as nice, and you feel like they are genuinely happy to see you.  While this office isn't as aesthetically pleasing as his old office, I gladly drive the extra distance just to be seen at this new office.

I know this sounds all gushy, but having been through so many other dentists, it is a huge relief to find one that cares, is proficient, and where you don't feel fleeced at the end of the visit.< /Review>

<text>Huge fan of Dr. Hada and his staff. He replaced some silver fillings of mine that were long overdue for replacement. What I especially appreciated was that there was one tooth that possibly needed a root canal, but he wasn't eagerly looking to do the more costly procedure (I automatically think that everyone is like a bad auto mechanic and will do everything to upsell and make a buck) and given that the tooth looked healthy, we did the "wait and see" approach, and the pain subsided eventually -- as he had predicted. That kind of honesty and expertise goes a long way with me. He's also been great with my 6 and 4 year olds, so it's nice to have a 1 stop shop.

UPDATE: I've been a patient of Dr. Hada's for a long time and I try to see him still even though I now live in Salt Lake City. This week I was in town for work and tried to get in to see Dr. Hada but he wasn't able to accommodate on such short notice, but luckily Dr. Chase Carlston was able to see me and I was able to get the work done during my short trip to California. Thanks Dr. Carlston, and good job Hada Family Dental for bringing in another solid dds.<//text><Resp>{'time': 1495813133016, 'text': 'Thank you very much for taking the time and leaving your positive feedback.

THIS DOLLAR GENERAL HAS AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MANAGER! I couldn't find my items that I was looking for, so I asked a cashier up front. She didn't just point or tell me where they were. She actually went with me to get my items and brought them up to the front register for me. That's when I noticed her name tag said manager(Candace). Only if we had more managers like this. To go out of their way to help customer(s).

The store is a very convenient location for me and a great place to coupon on already reasonably priced items. I especially love the app and the $5 off $25 offer. That alone is worth coming in for. They always have what I come in for (I usually come for laundry items because it's one of the cheapest places I've found) and I've never had a problem with the staff being rude.<//Text>

I've been trying all their Dollar General  generic products and so far I have yet to be disappointed. Their beauty products and household items have made it easier to save money and still keep the quality of life my family enjoys. Also one of the few places that still has friendly staff that greet you when you walk through their doors, and that's a HUGE place.<//Review>

Very rude customer service from one of the female managers. I understand that when its close to the store closing nobody wants to be at work any longer then need be but that is no excuse for bad customer service and making people feel very unwanted and telling them they are not to look while waiting to check out and then having another employee check them out while receiving dirty looks from her while she stood there and watched. Its also very hot in that store and all the employees were sweating pretty bad.. it was just sad. I woll drive the extra mile to the other DG from now on.</Text>

Selection is pretty good. Their decorations are a bit less broad when it comes to choice but still good. Got fall decor for the whole kitchen on a budget so I'll be going back soon for some Christmas ones. Especially loved themed paper plates.

Also was a lifesaver when literally everyone in my house got hit with the flu. Was able to get 6 bottles of day/night time medicine, sinus pills, antiseptic lozenges, for a fraction of what I would have paid at CVS.</text>

It was nice going to Dollar General. I miss shopping at DG, since they closed both Victorville locations. I luv buying my cleaning products and laundry soap from there. The prices are always reasonable and when I use my coupons that's even better.< /text>

The manager is super rude & unprofessional after my  last 2 visits I have never been back & I WILL NEVER SET FOOT INTO A dollar general store anywhere ever again in my life I even called their Corporate office & explained what took place & was told that the man in charge would review it & get in touch with me shortly? That was at the beginning of March 2019 & I have yet to receive any type of RESPONSE so I will never spend another penny or ever so much as go into another dollar general store.< /Text>

Always telling customers that they are closing in 10 minutes when they walk in to the store or already in the store instead of asking the customers if they are looking for something particular or need any assistance with information about a product. Most people are aware of the closing time and not happy to be reminded of it over and over again.<//Text>

Go to dollar general almost everyday. The employees are super friendly and help when they can. Most of the time they are stock up on everything. However, the lines can get very backed up which I do not mind most of the time.<//review>

I really like shopping at dollar general..easy in easy out very good prices and a good range of different items. I'm disabled this is a store I can always shop at. I hope they don't close our store. They have closed the Hesperia store but it was harder to get in and out there the store wasn't in a good location. I only hear good things about the Dollar General store itself. I hope they stay in business. It kind of worry's me that I'm being asked about it.<//review>

Brand new store that is loaded more than most dollar general stores (has many many items). Parking is a little small but never seen it too crowded. Staff is very limited but they have to keep their costs down somehow I guess.<//text>
