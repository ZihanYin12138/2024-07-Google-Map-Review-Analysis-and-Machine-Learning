<Text>Property management is the art of satisfying renters and landlords: a “no win” situation. Still, this office, and my manager, Brianna, have been superb. I appreciate the attention to detail and follow through. I can watch without feeling overly concerned. Decisions are trustable.</Text><Name>Mark Sussman<//Name><Rating>5</Rating>< pics>

For a rental company they worked out ok for me. Rented a place from them that went on 10 years and really had no problems. The few maintenance issues were always taken care of asap.<//text>

<Review>Multiple issues, not enough room. The kitchen sink:  the exit line is higher than the drain line so water and food sit in the drain line and rot, which cant be healthy. Was told they would nothing about it.  The shower will no longer stay at temp, it fluctuates from normal, to icey, to magma at the drop of a hat.  This started about a year ago.  They refuse to acknowledge it as a problem.  Called multiple times, building manager is never available.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Text>This company is well aware of scamers using their propertys information to cheat people on Craigslist and take their money and refuses to do anything about it. They could, minimum, flag the adds for removal or contact the administrator. They made it clear over the phone that they couldn't care less about the issue.< /Text></record>

I've had only good experiences from the very beginning.  The staff were very quick to respond when I inquired about the apartment, they were incredibly friendly and helpful, and very professional.  The apartment itself is beautiful and the grounds are well-maintained.  I had to put in one maintenance request, and it was taken care of right away with no issues.  I know everyone has their own individual experiences, but I only have positive things to say about California Oaks and  would recommend them to anyone.</Review>

I applied to rent a property they had available. I originally held off on applying because when I inquired someone else had been approved already. When that fell through, they reach out to have me apply. But it turns out, they do not have a first come first serve policy. They collect several applications and pick the “most qualified.” Which would have bothered me a lot less, if they had told me that up front. So I was told my application looks good but someone else was approved. Meanwhile, I saw a NEW ad for the same property had been posted that same day. So while they had already approved someone, and had other applications that “looked” good, they were still collecting even more applications.

On top of that, they have a policy in place that you can not even see the property until you are approved. (I assume this is because of Covid 19) And they could not even tell me how many square feet the unit was. Not helpful at all.

I can only imagine what issues would have come up if I had rented from them.< /review>

I know I'm not the only one that sees this has become the normal for most businesses. It's rare to get good customer service anymore, but when I do I give all my business to the business that still cares about customers.

The application and move in process was quick and easy. Since we moved in we have had little to no problems. We did  have a situation with our bathroom that I called into the company. My property manager Karina was out the next day to look at the issue which was quickly resolved. California Oaks has always been friendly and easy to deal with. I would recommend them to anyone.</review>< Pictures>

California Oaks have been managing our properties for years and they have always done a terrific job.  The staff members are always attentive and friendly as well as professional.  Being a Property Manager myself, on the commercial side, I understand what it takes to run a property  successfully and California Oaks Property Management excels at it.  Whether you are looking for a company to manage your properties or are looking to rent, I recommend California Oaks to everyone.</text>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Disturbing & unsanitary living conditions at their properties, see images. When I asked why this was allowed by management, was told it was being worked on; 1 year later, nothing had changed. Their admin/management staff was mostly rude and condescending. Their maintanence crew once told us that we looked pretty handy and to deal with apartment issues ourselves. At move out, we were billed with over $600 dollars for paint repairs for less than 500 sq. ft. apartment.< /review>< pics>

<Review>Do yourself a favor and rent somewhere else. No matter what you do, 80% of your deposit will NOT be returned due to painting, cleaning fees etc. and the apartments are overpriced and ghetto. Be on the lookout for their facebook marketplace postings and skip them.</Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I have been a California Oaks PM client for about 15 years.  My home is in Ventura County CA, but I live in northern California.  What I like most about Cal Oaks is that I don't have to worry about "anything"!  When I visit Ventura County, I always stop in and take a look at my home.  The tenants they get for my home are responsible and take excellent care of the property.  I find the staff to be responsive and friendly.  It's been a great experience and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to rent out their home or investment property!< /Review>

I've been renting from California Oaks Property Management for four months.  I'm appreciative to have a place to live that is within my budget.  I have only had one maintenance issue in that timeframe and it was corrected in a reasonable amount of time.  The owner of California Oaks is longtime resident of Ventura and very involved in the community.  In fact, when I first came into the rental office to fill out an application he and I had a conversation and he made be feel very welcomed.< /Text>

Very unfriendly staff that are not helpful at all. Dragged us on for 2 weeks when we applied for one of their properties telling us in the end that one of our applicants needed credit history to have our applications go through. When that was not stated anywhere on their applications or told to us before we wasted the $90 on applications for the place. Very disappointed and frustrated with this company. Don’t waste your time or money on these insensitive people. They don’t care about you or your time. Whoever manages this company should take some consideration into these reviews.<//review>

As we have now lived in our apartment which is managed by COPM for a month we have had a couple of issues and dreaded to have to make requests for maintenance due to reading other reviews. As for their service on taking care of the issues have been nothing but professional and very timely! So we do appreciate the fact that our issues were not put to the waist side and were handled appropriately. We are happy with their attention payed to what we thought was going to be a much bigger issue than it was!

I have rented from California Oaks for a year now and am thoroughly satisfied! I have never rented from a property management company before, and wouldn't think to use anybody else. The staff is friendly any time i go in, maintenance work on the apartment has been done seamlessly, they're open on Saturdays . They worked well getting a minor repair fixed without needing me to do anything. Overall just a positive experience with the company! I will continue referring my friends to them.<//text>

Horrible people! Brianna Strother is in charge and is the worst of the bunch. Unfriendly from day one. She's mean, (in her early 20s) unprofessional, harassing, and not too bright.  From the beginning, I was running late (going through LA traffic) arriving with my moving truck and she didn't want to stay 10 minutes past 6. She didn't care if I would be homeless for the night and just cruelly said, "too bad , you should have planned it out better". Refused to leave the key.  She was too lazy to look for my garage key until I informed her 3 times all the other neighbors have one. She then rudely admitted there was one and to pick it up. No apology. You are never allowed to talk to the owner of the homes (a mean old man) and you're at her mercy to be your landlord. Nothing gets fixed because she calls the wrong person for the job. (For example: She calls a chimney guy when my fireplace electrical sensor is fried. The guy has no idea about fireplaces, does nothing, but she still charged me $69!) I refused to pay this, so Brianna was being abusive  over the phone and so I hung up on her .  She then harassed me by calling me over and over again 12 times (she's nuts). I had to block her!  The owner, a bitter, mean old man, will snoop around your house on his days off (wearing his bicycling yellow leotard). When I confronted him (while snooping around again) , he was a coward about admitting who he was and became aggressive and threatening. He said he doesn't care what the management does. Don't rent from these monsters!</Review>

<review>2 stars for 1) allowing us the opportunity to live in such a nice community, and 2) not raising the month-to-month rent over a 3-year period.  Thank you.  However, I am utterly disappointed and appalled by my experience with this company.  The mold growing in our bathroom and shower was brushed off even after my husband and I invested in a certified environmental inspector to assess the issue.  California Oaks hired its own inspector who deemed the mold was not a problem, but expressed concern about the leak from under the toilet seeping down to the dining room ceiling below.  After repairs were made, there continued to be leaking. At one point, our drain clogged in the bathtub and when the plumber came to fix it, a large amount of water poured through the ceiling onto the carpet below!  Months later, we heard shuffling sounds in our ceilings at night and were concerned about rats- of course, another inspector came out and found no rodents or problems.  Our neighbors took initiative and setup mouse traps, which were successful in killing a rat.  During the drought, we requested to have our leaky kitchen faucet changed multiple times.  The California Oaks maintenance man arrived at his appointment to assess the situation, but did not come prepared with a faucet, as he repeatedly proclaimed, "I'm going to fix this up because I'm such a good boy." Awkward. Sink did not get fixed until months later when we were preparing to move out.  Today I received my move-out refund (from deposit) and I am shocked to see we were charged for not removing our satellite dish (that we cannot even access on the roof), along with a $225 flat cleaning fee AFTER we spent hours cleaning the unit based on the checklist they provided us prior to move out.  Since I cannot refute these charges, I leave you with my honest open review, Cal Oaks. May others consider themselves warned.<//review>< Pictures>

I had to travel for work on the day they needed/wanted me to come by and sign and pick up keys.  Even though, I contacted them and left a message as soon as possible explaining my situation and that I was interested in renting the property if they could please wait 2 days until I got back, they were not flexible to my request and what a shame.  This completely changed my opinion about them.  I need to do & keep my job in order to maintain & support any home.< /text>< pics>

I agree with all other comments here, this is managed by a group of wannabe snobs who misstreat you in every interaction during the process. I ended up not renting any apartment managed by this group of frustrated women and ended up paying higher rent somewhere else just to be treatwd fairly and not continue dealing with this horrible non professional girls. Laura and Maria are the worst of the bunch. I've never seen a human being so frustrated. I do have to say Eva was always nice to me.<//Review>

I responded one of their add for one of their properties, and my experience was very fearful from beginning to end. The staff is rude when answering the call, and the entire process made me feel as if I was applying for section 8; it was horrible. At the end, I believe they already had someone in mind and all they were doing was collecting the $25.00 for the many number of applicants to their add. There are many hints to make a reasonable judgment on poor services from feeling discrimination to unfair practices. Good luck for anyone working with California Oaks Property Management, I will not give it another try after my experience.</text>

I have rented a small house from Cal Oaks Property Mgmt for 13 years and I have always paid my rent on time, and they have been very responsive with property maintenance issues when I needed their help.     I had an Oven/range they replaced about 5 years ago, a microwave/vent fan they recently replaced last month (13 years old), a hot water heater they replaced two years ago (11 years old),  1 minor plumbing problem they had fixed, and a roof leak about 4 years ago that they had repaired after a series of hard rains, all within a few days.     In all instances, Cal Oaks staff & their contractors responded quickly.     Even when my water heater went out on a late Fri night they had it fixed by 11 AM on Saturday.    Appliance repairs/replacements  were done by Winkler Appliance Repair and once they got the authorization from Cal Oaks they fixed or replaced the appliance issues within a few days.         In a tight and expensive rental market, they run a business, but I've been happy with their responsiveness and having a good place to live.< /text>

Treated very poorly! We just signed an agreement even though we had to wait almost 3 weeks for a response! There is obviously a disconnect within the office staff they do not communicate with each other and act like complete snobbs! We have had to come back to complete paperwork when all of that should have been done in the initial application process. To say we made haved made a bad decision is an understatement. I recieved an email from an employee saying that the unit we applied for is vacant and ready to be viewed? I felt like it was an antagonizing email due to the fact that we had been waiting to hear wether we were approved for that exact unit?. These girls need to get it together this is supposed to be a professional agency!< /Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>The cast and crew of the most moronic and unorganized company I have ever dealt with, said we had to leave work early to check out estate but rented the house two hours later with no warning. Trash of a business run by people with only dollar signs in their eyes and no common sense. This is the worst organization we have ever dealt with. We would definitely never recommend them to anybody we know and especially to anyone looking to rent a home looking through these reviews. Take your business elsewhere.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80e9ad3dbcc433c1:0x43011ca0f7b6e9a9< /gmap_id></record>

I have rented from California Oaks Property Management for 4 years.  I'm moving out of the area for a job, they have been great to work with. When and if there was ever a problem or something needed to be fixed they were right on it.</Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>California Oaks (Takes advantage of tenants that do not understand painting, repairs, cleaning, craftsmanship, after cleaning every surface and patching, sanding and painting every nail hole, I was charged $1,057.50 to clean and repaint the entire apartment I only lived in for 11 months.)
1.I personally own two rental houses in Austin, so I am extremely familiar with property management companies and the level of craftsmanship necessary on repair work. The level of professionalism at CalOaks is sub-par, and they take advantage of people that do not understand home ownership, contracting and cleaning.
2.October 16’ I relocated from Austin to Ventucky, and was forced to pay rent for three weeks without even living in the converted garage.
3.When I did arrive to my $2200 garage, the front house was still not rented, and the front rent was dropped to match the converted garage price. When the front house was rented, they gave those tenants access to the three parking spots, and not me the first guy who was there.
4.While living there it got humid and hot, so naturally being from Texas I knew about Air Conditioning, I tried to purchase enough portable air conditioners to cool down this non- insulated converted garage, but sadly enough the old power panel could not handle more than (2) portable air conditioners without constantly tripping breakers, and (2) are not enough to cool the whole place. So, I luckily installed one portable air conditioner in my bedroom.
5.I requested in writing to add a small schnauzer pet to my lease, I was told approval was needed first. I got a verbal approval from an employee that told me I needed a $300 refundable deposit. When I called to confirm this Nery was mean and rude saying basically I was crazy, saying every pet request has to go through her, well she called me back and said the owner did approve the pet, and that an employee did call me, but the deposit is now $500.
6.Prior to my move out day I removed all screws and nails from walls, patched all holes, sanded all holes, textured all holes, and painted all holes with Behr Ultra Pure White, so my patch color was off from the wall color. There was approximately 30 holes throughout the converted garage. I also cleaned every wipeable surface in the entire converted garage.
7.I kept contacting Nery and would inquire on when I would receive my refund check, all she kept saying was within 21 calendar days of my moveout. Well without contacting me to explain or negotiate, CalOaks charged me $225 for cleaning and $1275 for repainting the entire converted garage all walls and ceiling.
a)After I gave up speaking with Nery, because she is so mean and rude, I chose to speak directly to Brianna Assistant Broker.
b)She negotiated with me and said I only had to pay half of the $225 cleaning charge.
c)She then tried to explain the painting, and said the painter said the only way to make my miscolored paint match was to repaint all the walls and ceilings. However, when I called the painter he said he wished I had contracted directly with him, because he must overcharge the owner and Cal Oaks. He said the owner told him to repaint the entire converted garage. He said he could have done the color match more on a budget and it would have been considered good painting craftsmanship. I explained this to Brianna, and she said the painter did not say any of this. SO I had to pay out of my pocket $945 to repaint the owners walls and ceilings, which is insane.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80e9ad3dbcc433c1:0x43011ca0f7b6e9a9< /gmap_id></record>

<text>After 3 plus years as a tenant I had to share our experiences with California Oaks.
First warning came when we looked at a property and signed on as renters.
Visiting the property we met some tenants and determined it looked to be a good place to live. I should mention that we spoke to a tenant about animals because we
noticed their was a dog living in one of the cottages. Well my wife signed the papers and was aware of the limitations and conditions set forth on the rental agreement. She assumed that we could pay more on balance and incur any additional costs that might arise when we leave. California Oaks said no and we could not reside there with a small a small dog.
It seems the property owner recently changed to not allowing animals. Best part of this experience is that we were forced to pay $400.00 because the deal was signed
and we could not just back out of contract due to their claim that they were put in a loss of revenue and that in rental agreement no animals were allowed and that deep in the language of contract there is a fee attached to backing out after contract is signed. We never moved in. We recall the property still not rented one week after this took place. Our mistake to be sure but to hold us to that $ 400.00 fee ? Looking back we should of fought it. I have to add that California Oaks refused our proposal to attach this $400.00 to another property they manage. No go.
Sometimes we do things we sense are wrong. Like dummies we looked further and found another property which California Oaks manages. You know that old saying about fool me once! Here we are with small dog more than three years later working to get out of the mire that California Oaks is.
Many calls have been made by us and the family in the front house. Most if not all calls about problems with water rot, termites, deteriorating conditions and more  are ignored.
Most often we are told a person will be out to have a look.
Sometimes someone does show up but when they do its after their own window of time for arrival. A return is always promised but that too never happens. We at this property have never been payed a visit by the property manager. She has no idea of the condition of the place nor is there ever any inquiry regarding property.
What we do get are the owner of property randomly showing up whenever it suits him or his family members to retrieve things from garage or to take his car out to use while visiting. Needless to say this management company lacks respect for its tenants and does not follow Rental Laws.  There have been three letters sent by California oaks regarding water usage. Two letters were sent late last year about over consumption of water. We don't water the grass. there are two of us living here.
we as tenants are asked to care for property and to maintain it as tenants. Does that include watering the grass one might ask? Well we smelled a rat and sure enough after the third letter sent and a statement about raising rent, our rent was raised.
We saw it coming but were bothered about such accusations of over consumption of water because we never saw California oaks here on the property. They never came to substantiate their claim regarding water use. Too underhanded and doesn't manage as they should.
My warning is don't rent from this company.</text><user_id>105339420244474197465< /user_id>< Pictures>

<Text>They require 2.5 times the rent - net income! If we were making that kind of money, we wouldn't need to be renting!  It was much like dealing with a machine - no personal thoughts taking place only rules being read.</Text><GmapID>0x80e9ad3dbcc433c1:0x43011ca0f7b6e9a9< /GmapID>< Pictures>

Awful Snooty Wanna be super models with No respect for tenants needs and no respect for prospective renters. I have looked several times at properties from this management company and have applied . Always denied because I did not make the extremely high three times the amount of rent income bracket. CRAP...What average family  right now makes three times their amount of rent in an even decent size home ?  One time years ago my father tried to co sign showing over 80,000 in the bank consistently and they THen asked for  TAX papers from him ...between the two of us we could have afforded five of their rentals at ONCE and the place I applied for was tiny . Amazing what they want to secure from you even though they have no intention of keeping you safe and comfortable with basic maintenance once they take your life savings upfront. Hahaha unbelievable . Luckily another company was smart enough to rent to me and two years later im still here and have never missed a payment.  I see their signs in front of the same places year after year after year...obviously no one wants to stay ,no one can afford to stay  or they turn them over with no regard to the familes living there , just to make a buck and that's a damn shame .....the front receptionist has been decent but some of the woman back there are very snotty. Ive heard so many crappy reviews from loved ones...its too bad. When we think of getting a bigger place we drive around looking and if the sign says California Oaks Property management our energy sinks and its like "  Oh never mind , don't even bother looking, bummer " .  I own my own small  business and my boyfriend is an Engineer. It shouldn't be this way.</text>

<text>Staff are rude when calling asking questions. When calling about resources available to renters displaced by the wildfire I was told "We can't control the air so ya." When the heater went out I was given electric space heaters for each room, weeks later, rather than fixing the central heat resulting in a high electric bill. Still to this date the heater doesn't work a year later.<//text>< Pictures>

Walked in with a dream and they fulfilled every bit of it! Purchased my first new motorcycle 9/29/2020 the staff there couldn't have been more helpful throughout the process. One of the guys behind the counter even offered my daughter a free sticker from the case! Great experience!<//review>

< Review>
The good people at Berkeley Honda Yamaha took good care of my bike and me. They did a fantastic job at ensuring that my bike was well cared for. The service is also just as good. I want to personally thank Carl for going above and beyond by staying on top his assigned tasks. He called me to inform me of updates. Other dealerships won't do the same.

I think it is fair to say that this dealership deserves your attention.  Good people that actually care for you and remember who you are.

To the owner of the Dealership, please do not change a bit, if you do listen to your customers. You are all doing a great job with everything. Thank you again for everything you have done for me.</Review>

The team at this dealership is absolutely top notch. Scott, Eli, and even the person who runs the finance department is super nice. If I had to  sum my experience up here over the years, they treat you like family here. No pressure to buy, always there to answer questions, and overall are good people. So good to the point where we've bought our 3rd motorcycle here! Hands down I recommend this place over East Bay Motorsports.</Review>

I called to purchase a part for my motorcycle. The man who answered the phone was rude and patronizing.

I have enough experience repairing this motorcycle to know what I am asking for. He told me the part I need is discontinued. Fine.

He proceeded to ask questions as if I were incompetent and had no idea what I was doing. I am confident that his attitude and tone were only based me being a female.

Strongly recommend you find another dealership to avoid this type of treatment.<//Review>

Terrible dealership, no visible passion for motorcycles, minimal inventory. Low quality helmets. Better off going to SF Moto or J&M Motorsports both are passionate about motorcycles and no commission sales staff.< /Text>

This is a review of my experience with Berkeley Yamaha Honda. The person you want to talk to is Scott and he is great. He is friendly, professional and respectful. You will not get any double dealing with you. Be straight with him and he will tell you for what it is. He is co-owner I think and will not talk to you like a sales person. So if you are thinking of getting a bike, this is the place to get.< /Review>

Most of my experience with Berk Yamaha was in 2006, 10 years ago!  Their honesty and competence was already excellent then.  Karl helped me with an insurance estimate.  His  prompt professionalism and solid information helped me get a fair settlement on the crashed bike.

Parts Dept. has helped me many times with parts and accessories in stock and special orders.  Very smooth transactions every time.  They're my dealer!< /review>

< Review>
Owned a bike of one sort or another for 35 years now.  In that course I've dealt with over a dozen shops.  I can easily sort them into two categories: 1) all the others and 2) Berkeley Yamaha Honda.  My first experience was two years ago when  new model I had purchased at another dealership required a filter for the break in service that hadn't hit dealer shelves yet.  Well after calling every dealer in Bay Area, Karl was the one and only guy to call me the next week when he got one in.  So after that treatment (on such a low markup service mind you) I've gone there consistently.  All services - great price, outstanding service each and every time.  On my way home I stopped in with slow leak in rear tire - caught them at a busy time - storeroom full of other customers.  30 minutes later I'm a scant few dollars lighter in the wallet and back on the road on a tire that needed no more attention until replacement time.  How good are they? - I am often tripped up when considering a new bike by any other manufacturer than Honda or Yamaha, because I appreciate their business so much.  They are the best!<//Review>

These guys might be good at something but it's not motorcycle repair. They charged me 700 for a service and some how missed some obvious issues. While making rookie mistakes like torquing down my oil filter and several other parts well past spec.</text>

Scott did a great job on selling me a new Interceptor, offered a fair deal and made it very easy. They are really straight shooters and I will be back. A great dealer!</text>

This place is a fraud. Took a moped here to be fixed up. They charged $350 for a "Tune and Repair." They were also adamant that there was no emissions sticker on the moped, which is required to take it to the DMV. After the bike broke down less than a week later I took it to a different shop and they said that I should sue this dealer because they did such a crappy job. The second repair ship easily found the emissions sticker, suggesting that this dealer didn't even open the bike to begin with< /Review>

Helpful, personal, and prompt service throughout. As a beginner rider, I was looking for a place that could give me trustworthy advice and offer personalized support through the process of buying my first bike. After researching and visiting several places, my choice fell on Berkeley Honda Yamaha, and I'm very satisfied. Warmly recommended.<//review>

Chris is parts is awesome. The parts dept. is on top of their game. If you have a Yamaha or Honda you should always get your work done at the dealer. Its a little more expensive, BUT isn't your bike worth it!!!!<//text>

If you need Yamaha parts or manuals (except keys - they send you to Rex Locksmith) they'll order it for you. They have a very small showroom and I don't think that they do a high volume, so prices seem to be more fixed (higher) than other places. Small selection of gear. Not sure about the quality of the service shop though.</review>

This is the best place to buy a bike from. I can't speak to the service department, but the sales staff were honest and helpful. They went out of their way to help me deal with a title issue on my used bike and went above and beyond what I expected from a dealer. They inquired several times about my issue at the DMV main office in Sacramento and kept updating me about the status. Ultimately they saved me from a few trips to the DMV as well as a pretty big fine (long story - not my fault, not their fault). They even offered to pay my registration as a token of good faith for the hassle (even though it was not their fault). This is not the kind of experience I expected to have with a dealership. Makes me want to buy my next bike from them, even though I don't live in the Bay anymore.

Bottom line: This is a great shop with knowledgeable and honest owner / employees. I would gladly buy my next bike from them.<//text>< username>

I really don’t get how this place is almost 5 stars! You know the owners are cheap when there’s writing on the thermostat that says not to set it lower than 74. It’s always understaffed. One poor lady hustling to get drinks and snacks out. Last time I was there I saw the touch screen where you sign/give a tip was dirty with dried sticky splatters of tea and no hand sanitizer to be seen. Several times I’ve been here and they were out of toppings. I keep giving it another chance because it’s so convenient, but it lets me down every time. Their tiger tea is not like the brown sugar types at most other places. It’s Thai tea mixed with something else, but the Thai tea overpowers whatever that is. I’d rather drive somewhere to get boba instead of walking to get this one.</Review>

THE BEST Thai boba tea I’ve had in Cali! I’m from Texas, and I’ve yet to find a boba tea spot here that I like until Tzone. The staff is nice, they’re fast & efficient. I’ve returned for the 3rd time this week. I’m hooked. 😂</Review>

<review>Got regular milk tea less sweet for $4.75. Not good. The milk tea was already mixed and in a container. Other places i've been to they mix the tea and creamer when you order it so it tastes better. The tea itself does not taste fresh. The taste of the non-dairy creamer was overwhelming, it masks most of the tea taste. If you like milk tea, I would stay away from this place.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3-l8TTP38h7DPiduWYaufn8qjRjJonqDpRffD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

Every time I order from this Tzone location (Cottle) I’m surprisingly let down more each time. Their coffee milk tea almost always comes hot/warm with ice in it, the drink does not have much flavor. Today I tried something new, the Oreo Blaster, it had absolutely no flavor, tasted like a hint of Oreos and ice. The pearls are okay, but not worth it, there are many other locations and stores that provide better boba drinks.<//Text>

<review>Not too many creative milk teas here. They have your standard flavors plus smoothies. All their snacks are fried. And a few desserts in their dessert case. Every time I've ordered a regular size they give me a large size without asking. At least they're boba pearls are made just right</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I went to Tzone the other day and was so impressed by their extensive drink selection. It took awhile to decide what I wanted because everything just sounded so good. I finally decided on the White Tiger Milk Tea and was so glad I did. I think I may have found my favorite go-to drink. It was so delicious that I chugged the whole thing in only a few minutes! Not only are their drinks absolutely delicious, the staff were super friendly as well. I will definitely be back!</Review>

The tea is okay and options are plenty. This franchise has been around despite the location being new. Tzone doesn’t bring much to the mix.  The regular milk tea with honey boba was standard. There was too much ice and the boba was average.  For 4.75 the value is not amazing.<//review>

They have a pretty robust menu and the attempt is there but the tea is lacking in my opinion. Their advertising can also be misleading. The cups are not the chubby kinds as seen on the menu. Service is good.<//text>

Taro Milk Tea is non-dairy & caffeine-free. It would have been great to know what other non-dairy drinks are sold here.< /Text>

Drove all the way across San Jose because I happen to like one of the things on their menu, just to find out they got wrong times listed on here at Google. They close at 10.30pm, not 11pm on Thursday nights. Mistakes like these are why businesses don’t run for too long. Disappointed!< /review>

MÉXICO (NAYARIT) 🇲🇽
Excerpt from Eat the World Los Angeles:
The Mexican state of Nayarit is no stranger to Los Angeles, with many families claiming roots there and the coastal cuisine living large in the lives of many Angelenos. This usually consists of plates of freshly prepared mariscos, unique ceviches, and the awe-inspiring pescado zarandeado, but a tiny little Pacoima joint has been hawking the tamales of Nayarit for around ten years.

"Estilo Nayarit" is actually quite easy to miss on the sign, especially while flying by on wide Glenoaks Blvd. With the holidays approaching, there will be many feelings about tamales to go around, but for those without stacks of them made at home, Rosy's is a unique find to enjoy the recipes that trace their origin to the owner's hometown of Zacualpan.

Even coming in from the blazing summer sun, there is an enjoyment to eating a tamal with a cup of hot champurrado, always available here at Rosy's. What can be less easy to find are the chicken tamales, the stars of the show, which are frequently sold out. Fresh batches are prepared throughout the morning (Rosy's closes at 13:00) though, so if your timing is not perfect on the first visit, just try again another day. Start with the tamal de pollo en salsa verde, which they have covered with a handwritten "HOT" notice on their board. The sauce is green because of an ample use of jalapeños, and is always made fresh.< /review>

Good tamales the pork in red sauce was slightly spicy and the chicken in green sauce but WAS spicy. For both tamales the masa wasn't as light and fluffy as I like.

The champurrado was tasty and hot.<//review>

<Review>The most authentic and delicious tamales...

You can’t go wrong with the pork ones. I’ve been eating these tamales every other week or so and the taste is every time the same authentic one. The moment you peel them off, unlike most not so good tamales, all dough comes off and does not stick to corn leaves. I strongly suggest this place. The only down side I see is that it’s a cash only place.< /Review>< Date>

I've been getting tamales from here for years and they haven't disappointed. They're consistently delicious, well stuffed and the salsa is superb! Dont forget to ask for some. I only wish they would modernize their ordering process as it can be slow when its busy especially around the holidays.< /Text>

I came to sample the tamales because I needed something good for my guests for the holiday and was very disappointed. My tamales were served cold even though they served to eat here. They weren't bad, just tasted over cooked and tough to cut. Tamales aren't supposed to be difficult to eat  or served cold!!!<//text>

It was dirty with bugs flying EVERYWHERE inside the restaurant and I felt discriminated against. I walked out after being ignored just a little too long while she helped other customers in line behind me.</review>

<Text>I woke up early today to buy several dozen tamales. Only took 30 mins to get to the front but i had to wait another 30 while they steamed the pork.  It was well worth the wait!!  I purchased a variety of their tamales and they are ALL very tasty.  This is "the" place to get your tamales.  Don't bother calling, they won't answer the phone during the busy holiday rush.  Just get in your car and head over, you wont be disappointed.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

This is the place  you'd want to take someone if they're eating tamales for the first time.  Seriously,  rosies tamales is that good. In fact I brought a dozen of them to my workers and within swconds they were gone. I had everybody asking where i got them. They have red chicken or pork and green chicken or pork , cheese and chile and sweet . That sell soda and frozen tamales.  Suring the holidays this place gets crazy busy. Its nothing  to see a line out the door around 7am on a friday. Half a dozen is 7$ and a dozen is 12$. I'm not sure if they sell any other foods other tamales<//review>

(Translated by Google) these are THE MOST delicious tamales in the valley! my favorites are rajas & elote. their champurrado is pretty good, too. a dozen tamales come out to $ 27, but they're definitely worth the price. remember, QUALITY over QUANTITY. so those complaining about prices are just being cheap.

estos son los tamales mas deliciosos del valle! mis favoritos son los de rajas & elote. el champurrado tambien esta bueno. la docena sale a $27, pero valen la pena. recuerden, es CALIDAD sobre CANTIDAD. los que estan renegando del precio son una bola de codos!<//review>

(Translated by Google) I have been buying tamales here for 10 years and they are delicious, but in recent years they no longer fill the chicken and pork tamale in addition to not adding salt or for flavor ..... 👎 a dozen already costs $ 30

(Translated by Google) After 8am they no longer have corn or other tamales and less champurrado as if it would cost a lot to do it, they only do that, they do not make as much food as a restaurant as the ones next to you, pay attention to what who sell the most and try to have it for the good of their customers and more profit for their business, stop cleaning at 8am and produce more corn tamales, they have everything, to do it, do not trust the employees, see the sales for yourself increase them. The corn tamales taste more dough than Elote.

(Original)
depues de las 8am ya no tienen tamales de elote o de algun otro y menos champurrado como si costara mucho hacerlo , solo a eso se dedican , no hacen tanta comida como un restaurante como los que estan a un lado de ustedes , pongan atencion a lo que mas venden y tratar de tenerlo para  bien de sus clientes y mas ganancia para su negocio, dejen de limpiar desde las 8am y produscan mas tamales de elote , tienen todo , para hacerlo, no se fien de los empleados , vean ustedes mismo las ventas incrementelas. Loa tamales de elote ,saben mas masa que a Elote.<//Text>

Tried the Bagel Pizza and I didnt really like it. Flavor wasn't good at all. I'd give that a 2 out of 10. Also had a mango smoothie and that was bad too. Had a chemical taste to it. Yuck.<//Review>

<text>I love the bagel pizza and i recommend it! You will be very satisfied because the other donut shop is no clean and rude employees but here is very kind, talkative, funny, etc. 🍩 i always come to this donut shop because they can actually cook good food! 5 stars for this donut shop!< /text>< pics>

The doughnuts look great, however the same cannot be said about the inside of this place.  All countertops are dirty, i can see dust all over the place and i noticed an icecream freezer thats out of order and there's a bunch of items stacked over it. The walls are stained the cash register looks to be greasy... I don't think i will ever be going back.  I understand that i can't expect for every place to be spotless but this is a place where food is made. I wouldn't recommend this place.< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) This place is for me a little corner where I can share with my children because since they started walking I brought them to eat their donut at Lucky Donuts and breasts. It is a wonderful custom because they have the best donuts and varieties of juices, tea and breakfasts for my children and I like to have breakfast in this place the atmosphere and the courtesy of the owners is fantastic I recommend them with not 5 stars with a hundred stars

Jerry and his team were amazing. Delicious meal of chicken nuggets, whoppers, fries and soda. Clean restaurant. Only thing was the fries were cold and I wish they would make them fresh but other than that everything was perfect.< /Text>

Went to the local Burger King to try out the new Impossible™ Whopper®, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was in stock and available even more surprising was how close it was in taste and texture to actual beef patty. It's closer IMO than the beyond to actual beef.< /Review>

The employee with the glasses and ponytail was rude to me. She did not have a name tag but she claims that she is the manager. She was Hispanic. She yelled at me and refused to give me my order in the drive thru. She forced me to pick up the order inside the store. Last time I came here the male manager was okay with me going to drive thru to pick up order and it was in the morning when I picked it up. I think she is a new manager. She is Rude to customers and unprofessional.
Customers is always right. Managers please fire this new employee who has glasses and is wearing a ponytail. She was very mean to me and other customers<//review>

There's an outdoor play ground for kids, too hot. Outside seating as well. Inside of the restaurant seems clean. Unisex restroom. Ask for the code. Extremely clean restroom! Service was quick. I only ordered an icee cup, lol.  No complaint.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c2dafa7968fb9f:0x4be8c0bb02945fca< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The store doesn’t feel busy.  Some staff is very nice but some are pretty emotionless.  One in particular never greets or says thank you. Tables and the floor are naturally clean.  It’s an ok BK.< /Review>

I had the best made whopper junior here. By the book. The onions, tomato, and lettuce set so beautifully. The cashiers were so friendly! July 21, 2019. 10:05a.m. Order 86.< /Text>

<Name>Ti Mao</Name><review>We came in to get a burger to go,, the burger was cold when we get home in 5 mins.
This location has an outdoor playground for the kids. Inside the restaurant is clean and has a TV monitor.The service is friendly.
Overall, I was surprised why the burger was cold!  Maybe it's not fresh made.<//review></record>

BK needs to clean up the place properly. I took my 3 children and wife to this venue and they couldn’t wait to leave because of the unclean restroom and dining area. The mayonaise packets were damaged and they were still put out for consumers to take...hmmm....it is too bad because BK has very good food especially the Impossible Whopper!</text>< Pics>

I got a water cup and the lady yelled at me for not getting water. But other people put juice in their water cups. She only messed with me. I always get soda with my water cup and the other workers don’t yell at me. This lady is a rude worker. She’s Mexican. Also their beef is not well cook. I found a rock inside their beef. Yuck!</Review>

Filthy venue which is a shame cause the 2 for 6 whopper is a good deal. Bunch of employees standing around but nobody cleaning anything. Can't imagine what the cooking area looks like. Yuck. Go to a different BK.<//Review>

<Review>I like this place for good quality and value of burgers  and great sodas. Very good burgers, the whopper is huge compared to burgers of other chain stores. This location has an older looking interior like what you might find in a small town, but their sodas are strong in flavour and full in the fizzy carbonation. This place gives you an overall very easy relaxed  experience. Highly recommended!<//Review>< Name>

You have got to try the Oreo shake that they sell. It is DELICIOUS! I recommend the classic if you're not a big fan of chocolate, but if you DO enjoy it, then go for the chocolate Oreo shake. I don't really eat at Burger King, but I really do enjoy that milkshake<//review>

<Time>1518404841690< /Time><text>I like this place for good quality and value of burgers  and great sodas. Very good burgers, the whopper is huge compared to burgers of other chain stores. This location has an older looking interior like what you might find in a small town, but their sodas are strong in flavour and full in the fizzy carbonation. This place gives you an overall very easy relaxed  experience. Highly recommended!< /text>< Resp>

I recommend the classic if you're not a big fan of chocolate, but if you DO enjoy it, then go for the chocolate Oreo shake. I don't really eat at Burger King, but I really do enjoy that milkshake< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

It's 3/2/2021 around 6:30 the two young girls working the drive threw are super fast and friendly make buying from here pain free.. definitely the best burger king in town and it's because of the service

They need a raise or some kinda bonus</review>

Food is good, cooked well. But their customer service is awful, including their manager. Always questions about how you want your meal, sighs after you have asked a question, always messes up on our orders.<//Text>

< Review>
On 6/17/2016 at 1pm, What an experience visiting this Burger King, unbelievable it needs 25cents to use the bathroom, after I finished ordering, I requested one of the girl at the counter for the bathroom key, she gave me 5 cents instead of 25 cents, I told her that was not enough and she ignored me, I was standing there for about 30 minutes waiting for my order and a quarter for the bathroom,  She was busy at the register, I kept reminding her about the bathroom issue, she did not seem to care, at the same time, my order was not ready either!  Actually my order was at that kitchen window, but no one care to give it to me until I asked, it took about half an hour for me to get my food and finally I got the quarter for use of the bathroom not until I was upset.
It is not acceptable for a fast food restaurant to keep customer waiting their food for 30 minutes in a moderate customer day, my order was just a hotdog meal and a single hotdog basic.
The service was so terrible due to under manpower, Any fast food restaurant try to make bathroom money Will not last too long, and I will not recommend this Burger King to anyone at all.< /Review>

The food is good, but this location (along with the entire shopping center it sits in) is well past its prime.  The interior is worn and in need of an update.<//text>

I found a hair in my drink, and when I went to confront the manager she blamed me claiming that I must've put something in the cup. Don't go here.< /Text>

<Review>If you are not going to have enough people working in the morning then don't serve breakfast.  Waited at the drove thru for 5 minutes,  then at the pickup window and saw someone working wearing earbuds. Parked and went inside.  I only ordered for me and a friend but three people behind me received their order first and was given my coffee cups,  empty,  but the coffee pot was behind the counter.<//Review>< user>

The French fries were a little stale. I bought them at 10:30 am. So I don't know how long they were sitting under the heat  lamp.</text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The biggest feature of this burger is that it tastes better than others, and many burgers are not as good as it. Mainly because this shop is willing to put ingredients, so it is delicious.

这家汉堡的最大特点是味道比别家好吃,很多家的汉堡都不如它的味道好。主要是因为这家店舍得放料,所以好吃。< /Text><Name>Jay Sheng< /Name><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Xq the salad I bought was very bad in the sense that it was not funny, I mean it was a few pieces of lettuce and that was all, they have no grace to make salads, very bad place, I do not like it and I will not return there.

(Original)
Xq la ensalada que compre estaba muy mal en el sentido qye no tenia gracia, osea era unos pedacitos de lechuga y eso era todo, no tienen gracia para hacer ensaladas, muy mal el lugar, no ne gusta y no volvere ahi.<//Text>

I walked into an empty bar with a friend for my birthday where I was told to pull the mask over my nose behind the plexiglass that encased the employees behind the bar.  I told the waitress I wanted a lemon drop and she asked me if I wanted "all the pretty little sugar sprinkles on the rim".  I said yes.  She then asked me if I wanted a pretty little lemon slice on top too.  I said yes.  She handed me my drink and I sat down in the empty bar where I discovered she put salt on the rim.  I brought the cocktail back and she asked if I wanted her to make the drink all over again.  I said yes.  She ripped the drink out of my hand, spilling it all over the counter, pouting while she remade it, whispering under her breath to the other employees about me.  I brought the drink back over to my table, took my mask off and about to sit down when she screamed at me to not take off my mask until fully seated.  Worst experience I've ever had in a bar.  I will not be returning</Review>

It's just down the street from the Shady Lady, Iron Horse, The Snug and a few other R Street bars. Check it out if you need a little change of scenery.<//Text>< pictures>

Cute little hipster’ish bar with records and a movie playing. Ernesto, a Golden Doodle, is a bar regular since he was a puppy there.</review>

Unacceptable, he was lucky I’m a nice guy.  If this place hires people like that be careful going here.  I called the bar after it happened and the women on the phone seemed annoyed.

<review>Favorite bar when its not crowded. Its in midtown so the hipster scene is in full swing after around 6pm. But for a quick drink after a long week, its great. They always have old movies playing and the sound quality is great for such an oddly shaped room.</review><Response>None<//Response><user>110538762975119068790<//user><gmapID>0x809ad0df8902095d:0x2746cb930696b1f<//gmapID>< date>

<text>Best bar in sac. Love the movies they play, the music is always on point. The ambience is chill and comforting. The bartenders are never rude and never make me feel rushed even if it's busy. BEST whiskey sours, they really know what they're doing! Mixologists for sure. I trust the staff. This place is my go-to, I always bring my friends here.< /text>< Pictures>

Great little dive bar. Good, cozy decorations and good drinks. They often have fun themed nights and a good DJ spinning records. It can get a little crowded and loud on the weekends so not ideal for a quiet intimate kind of hang,  but perfectly cozy with booths and a bar of your looking for a low key chill time.<//Text>

This is one of those places you would walk by and not expect it to be such a  happening spot. It has a great vibe once you walk in. This place gets packed!  Not much seating!  My visit I tripped over a dog as many others did as well.  Not a good place for a lap dog, running around!  Bar staff make good drinks and enough good beers on draft<//review>

Really fun bar to go to. Has a parking lot to the side if they aren't already taken up. Love the atmosphere here, always playing great music. I love how the table between the booths are skinny so you can really be face to face and have great social interactions with friends. Wish they had more on draft though.</review>

<review>Vintage old school style bar. The one time I went it was a little too loud for a off night and the space was a bit small but intimate. Bartender took care in their drinks that they served us but the same drink was different between bartenders. I would definitely have up the place bar hopping but not choose it as a place to stay all night.</review>< GmapID>

<Date>1505140171120<//Date><Rate>3< /Rate><Review>B Side is a dive bar that's known for its music. They play lots of fun stuff and have nights where DJs come in and spin. Beer selection isn't stellar but mixed drinks that are strong is what B Side does, and they seem to do that well. This venue is small and rather bare bones, but they do let you bring in outside food and there's an interesting vinyl collection to peruse. If you want lots of creature comforts and have any objections to downtown hipsters, this is not your place. If you don't mind the previously mentioned and you like dive bars, check 'em out.<//Review>< Pics>

Nice things about this place.  Off street parking, cool analog vibe, reasonable prices, neighborhood bar.  But the martini I got kinda sucked.<//Text>

<Review>If I could of gave 0 stars I would of. I have been to this bar for a long time, before it amqas B side. We showed up with.18 people celebrating a bday. A patron complained that we were too loud which is a joke since this a bar. The bartender then proceeded to be rude , wouldn't even hand me a straw. We obviously left. Sad to experience such poor service, especially since we have been going to this bar over 15 years mos def won't be going back.</Review>< date>

Neat place, but too loud to think when they put the music on.  They were showing the highly regarded, movie-classic, "Predator, " which no one else recognized (tells you about the average age of the crowd). I had a bad beer, and quickly planned my escape.

If you're over 30, find somewhere else. But not a terrible place.< /text>

I was really Amazed by this place. What looks like a dreary bar on a corner street is actually a very nicely decorated establishment with hi wall Booth seating as well as good bar seating with a lengthy bar and a DJ booth. The vibe is welcoming and the bartenders are nice. The old Gangster movie Casinonwas playing which was a good moodsetfer with the style of the movie and the warm wood decor of the bar. Halloween decorations were great and they let dogs of all size in.</Text>

Small bar that plays a lot of house music and old school rap. The drinks are reasonably priced. It's also a treat to watch bad 80's or 90's films while you're buzzed. Defeintly an underrated place.</review>

Nice touch with the usb wall chargers, and coat hooks at the booths. Nice little venue for chill vibes, good music and old school atmosphere.</Review>

Every experience is what you make it!
The staff are excellent and if you don't like the music, come back tomorrow. Vinyl DJs and vibe changes nightly.
This fancy little dive bar has a low lit 70s feel and is a locals favorite.< /text>

From the moment I walked in I felt welcomed. The girls there were amazing! They were eager to help and the prices were more than reasonable. Another thing, if you are looking for cabinet hardware they have a few options to choose from, far cheaper than any of the big box stores! It's a must if you need moldings.<//text>

I had contacted Greg online, then actually drove to their store to see in person. All their prices were WAY better then most of the trim/mouldings and doors I had previously looked at from other stores (same exact styles too). When Greg knew what I wanted he came out to my new home build take measurements for all my doors. Greg gave me a timeline of when my doors would be complete and was very open and honest about every step along the way. He always communicated with me about what was going on and when doors would be delivered. Everyone in their store was friendly and professional, even the delivery man. I would definitly reccomend them to anyone who needs doors, trim/mouldings, door hardware etc. THANK YOU<//Text>

<review>Had an amazing experience at this store today the girls upfront were very informative, knowledgeable and helpful. I purchased 6in base board and Daniel loaded my truck and Greg helped me secure it. Daniel and Greg went above and beyond my expectations, they were very professional, answered all my stupid questions and made sure the load wouldn’t fall off my truck. I will be back for crown molding and French doors and I will be telling all my friends. I almost forgot the best part, I saved a ton of money. The product was great and at an amazing price!<//review>< Pics>

They do the very least to help you and their choices are slim to none. Could probably do a better job myself.</Review>< Pics>

<Date>1523473166983< /Date><rate>1</rate><review>Disgusting people and bad workmanship. They bash the stores around them to boost their visibility on Google. The one star reviews on the business next to them are from the same people who are related to the owners here. Very untrustworthy. They use probably the cheapest materials they can find. My door ended up looking weak. The door started to warp after a couple months of ownership. Definitely won't stand up to the heat, wind, or cold. The door now leaves a draft in my house that I can't get rid of. When I contacted them about it, I've never been treated worse in my life, terrible people, terrible job, WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.

Edit:
Also, if you're going to spend time bashing the store next to yours, don't be surprised if they retaliate. Like you said, spend time working on your own business and maybe you might succeed one day. For others reading this, a lot of the reviews posted on this page are from the owners themselves as well as their friends and family. Take them with a grain of salt. They act high however they bash the stores around them to boost themselves on the maps. Notice the powder coating store next door has one star reviews from The same people who own this business. Very rude and very unfair, there are better places to shop than here. We will remove bad reviews if we see yours gone, otherwise I may just add more.</review>< pictures>

<text>Great customer service. They really know their doors. When I made a mistake and ordered the wrong size they were able to replace them and sell them to someone else. Good prices and better quality than the big home centers.  They also have a very large selection of baseboard and casings.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

My husband and I went in there a over a month ago wanted to purchase two exterior doors plus framing and two intirior doors. We needed installation and went with the contractor there. After he came to give us our estimate he contacted us twice after we reached out to him several times and gave us vague time frames and those dates came and went. I really want to support small and local businesses but will have to take my business elsewhere. So unbelievably disappointed with my experience. If he didn't have time for us or want our business why give us the run around?</Text>

<text>The first time I went here the service was not all that great... But I fell in love with a dining table set so I had to go back because I couldn't find it anywhere else. The second time around it was a very different experience... I got my dining table set, a server table and free delivery! It was an older gentleman that helped me out he wasn't hovering to make a sale but was easy to locate when I had questions. Very pleasant experience the second time around!</text>< Pics>

Buy at your own risk. I bought a custom sectional on 2/10 after getting promised from them that they would deliver in 3 weeks even during the slowdown from the COVID pandemic. No delivery updates were given to me for a few weeks after, I had to call in mid-April asking them what was going on, they said the furniture would be in the warehouse ready for delivery 4/30. Nobody called me on 4/30, I called the following Sunday 5/2 asking them why they didn't give me an update, they said the manager would call back. Nobody called me back that day. The next day I called questioning why the manager didn't call me back, they were confused as to why no manager called me and said they'd call back later that afternoon. I did not receive any phone call that afternoon. That was the last straw.

I've been waiting over 3 MONTHS for this sectional that I was told would be delivered in 3 WEEKS. This whole time I have not had any furniture for my family. I ended up getting my credit card agency involved to handle this BS. The customer service and the business model here are just absurd. They hand out false promises, and they never call back with any updates when you ask, or they simply give you the run-around and say the "manager will get back to you", to which they never did. At least have the courtesy and respect to give your customers updates for delays and such, especially when they ask for it and when they have spent thousands of dollars. Just a poorly run business model, and I will not be giving them any business from my end. I'm actually not surprised after reading the other reviews with similar experiences, just gives me more justification for reaching out to my credit card agency.< /review>

Purchased in November sofa and love seat $$$: Sofa is great!  Love seat cushion arrived smashed and snagged.  After emails to them that magically disappear, and numerous calls and promise that they will call back , they are still unable to replace ONE SIMPLE  CRUSHED CUSHION, and have no idea if it will ever be replaced.  Now it's out of stock and the manufacturer doesn't have any more?  Such a mysterious impossibility. The sale is the big thing, customer service and satisfaction is not a priority.</review>

After getting the COVID-19 excuse from other furniture stores, Savon boasted about how their products are all made in the USA and turnaround for a custom built sectional was 3-4 weeks. Placed an order for a sectional on 3/5 and still don’t have it as I’m writing this review on 4/28. They tried to deliver the wrong one once. No phone calls or updates of any kind. When my wife called the store to inquire they said they wouldn’t refund a measly $199 “delivery/set up” fee. Instead, they offered us 15% off our next order, I almost couldn’t laugh hard enough! I’ll be going back to Bob’s or Ashley in the future. I don’t mind the delays, but at least be a professional adult and keep your customers abreast of what’s going on. It’s no wonder that their parking lot is always empty. At least their employees have a store full of comfortable furniture to scroll through their social media feeds.<//text>

This place is a one stop shop! Amazing customer service, large selection of furniture and beautiful home accessories. Sam and Mike were a great help. They help me furnish my whole house. They were very patient and kept giving me different options and ideas. I definitely would recommend this place for anyone! They even have a kids area which made it easy to keep the kids entertained while I looked around. This place is great in every aspect.</Review>

I am not one to make reviews on businesses, but I want to warn everyone to NOT ever purchase anything from this sorry excuse for a furniture store.
My fiance and I went into this store on their grand opening. We purchased a bed set, some end tables, and a dining room set. Spent roughly $3000 at their store.
After about 4 weeks of hearing nothing about our order, we contacted them and was told our bed set and end tables were on back order and would be delivered within a month. How could a brand new furniture store already have back ordered products??? We called and texted all contacts at the location as to why this was not shared with us. My fiance talked to the manager, Victor, and he said he would call us back with a more concrete date of delivery and also would try to contact other manufacturers to see if we could get it earlier. We never got a call. Called multiple times, and were told that we would get a call back when he was available.
Here, a month later, we try to contact Victor again. We were continuously told we would get a call from him. Never did. Finally called the store and got a hold of him, he acted extremely confused, said another associate was supposed to give us other options as the bed frame would now not be here until April. We asked for a refund, said we would hear back tomorrow. We did not hear back, and ended up having to do a Better Business Bureau claim to finally get a refund.

We got our table after much deliberation. However, we had a terrible experience with the delivery team. They showed up at 6PM with 3 out of the 6 chairs. They said they would go to their warehouse and grab them and be back in 20 minutes. They never showed up. We called at 8PM asking where they were, and they got "busy." Never called to tell us they were not returning and we sat around waiting for them all evening

The lack of organization and customer service will not serve this new business well. Save yourself hassle.<//review>

Proceed with caution. If you chose to purchase furniture from this store make sure you take photos of what you want, take a photo of the paper work on display near what you’re ordering, take thorough notes and keep records of all communication throughout your experience. This store has a lot to offer and the sales people make big promises that unfortunately for us weren’t kept. We ordered our couch on 12/28, a custom item displayed on the sales floor and were told that it would be in our home in 2 1/2 - 3 weeks. Once that time had passed every bit of communication had to be initiated by us.. so and so is with someone, not there at the moment, we will call you back.. no call backs. At one point we were told that a part of our order was in but not all, then told nothing had come in and it was blamed on the grapevine closure due to weather. After some persistence over the next few days it was in. Upon delivery we realized there were a few items missing and were assured that it would be taken care of. After further inspection the couch was completely wrong, padding was missing, pillows were the wrong size, just a completely wrong design, similar, but wrong... and incredibly poorly made at that. I immediately called the store to tell them and of course was promised a manager would return my call shortly. Nope. The next day I called again and refused to take the BS of call backs or the let me look into it they say every time we had called. They came to pick up the couch and have since continued to shift the blame onto the manufacturer rather than display integrity, professionalism and empathy for the huge mistake and inconvenience placed upon us as a customer. Honestly, the only apology we have received was from the delivery guys and their manager. The couch was so poorly designed that the delivery manager called after it had been picked up to ask me if they had left cushions behind and couldn’t believe that so much padding was missing from the seating areas of the couch and he couldn’t figure out how the cushions should have been positioned.  I went to the store today to remeasure and reorder the correct couch and I’m hoping it gets done correctly this time and honestly if I hadn’t been searching for the perfect couch for 2 years or I could purchase this item elsewhere I would be demanding my money back. $1700 is enough to expect good quality and customer service. But rest assured, instead of an actual apology or a waived fee or anything else they could do for you, they will do you the courtesy of not charging you for pick or or a restocking fee. Literally, “it’s the manufacturers fault, but we called them and we aren’t charging you any extra fees for picking it up or a restocking fee.” Thanks.</Text>

I had previously left a VERY positive review for this place after having purchased a Warrior collection from them; however, after almost a month and still only having received 2/3 items that I purchased I take my review back. I call and they make idle promises to call me back, but they never follow through. They even told me it'll [Love seat] arrive within a week, but nope. Nothing ever comes. Tread elsewhere. I don't respect their sale practices and lies. If you're reading this, I beseech you adhere to to my words and steer clear.</review>

If I would have known these guys would make buying furniture super easy this would have been my 1st and only stop. We really liked being greeted at the door by Rocky he was very helpful right from the start asked us what we were looking for and worked with us. Not only did they help us pick out a couch they were very patient and helpful while we picked out colors and fabric to customize it. They also helped out customizing our bedroom set. They were very knowledgeable about their merchandise which we really liked. Shout out to Sam who also assisted us with measurements color schemes and the financial part of it. Overall awesome experience shopping here at Savon furniture< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>So Were from Bakersfield visiting family and I've been on the hunt for something unique for our new house. SAVON literally inspired us!!! I'm obsessed with the selection and the way it's set up I could spend all day there. I felt like I was walking into architectural digest! I picked out a living room set and coffee table set with a carpet. I was so inspired I took ideas for my wall paint for our new home from the actual store! We went with Pale pink warm brown and gold! My husband hates pink anything but the way it was styled so elegantly had him sold. Lol it's a big win for me I've been trying to convince him for ages that pink done right is so relaxing and stunning "Now that's pink!" Were his exact words.

Also big Thank you to Sam for being so accommodating and shipping to Bakersfield helping us by working with our budget! He helped finance us and made the process so simple and effortless. Theres free coffee and drinks...I had coffee with my husband while getting financed . That helps when you have kids lol we appreciated the extra boost! Theres a nice waiting area for the kids which made my life a lot easier! Definitely recommend for families especially with little ones. Well be back for our bedroom and dining room once we finally move into our new home sooonnn!!😍< /text>< Pics>

14,000 dollars for a sofa? It's 50% off so all you are paying is just 7000 dollars. This place has high end furniture but extremely over priced.</text>

After multiple trips to and from store finally agreed to refund after not being able to provide item. Definitely wouldn’t recommend but they did finally correct the problem.</Review>

<text>Love shopping here. I have been a loyal customer for years. BUT. They refuse to price match their online prices. Not the promotions. The sales price. And if it's out of stock online? Your paying full price. I asked and the manager said NO.. They can't adjust the price because their system doesn't allow it. Seems like BS. Gotta stay competitive. Everyone else honors their online prices.</text><username>Liz Koster< /username><Pics>None</Pics>< user_id>

<review>Purchased a gift for my girlfriend, item did not fit. Attempted to return item and was rudely told that “this is a final sale item so i can’t help you”. NOWHERE was I warned at time of purchase that this was a Final Sale item. No sign indicated such either. What a scam!</review>< Pictures>

This isn’t my favorite Forever 21, as the clothing selection is not as good compared to bigger cities. But my niece and I found some GREAT items this past Saturday, and were helped by the super friendly and helpful Izzy and Patty! Thank you for helping make our day fun!:)< /Text>

I buy pretty much all of my clothes here besides jeans lol. They have great prices and lots of sale/clearance. Sometimes it gets pretty messy but the employees have always been very nice to me. I also do a lot of online order pick up in store here and the employees are always very quick to help me. If you don’t want to pay for shipping and don’t mind going to the store try their ship to store option.< /Text>

<time>1534368880311<//time><rating>4</rating><Review>I went in today for to return an item I bought in Modesto. I asked about the return policy and they said I would get my money back the way I paid and I could return to any store with the receipt. I remembered after I left modesto though that the Stockton store told me returns were store credit only. So I went in and asked why the difference. A very helpful associate (I didn't get her name) told me they had updated the return policy to get your money back. I was very happy to hear that news. I only give a 4 star though because the company DOES NOT have a return policy posted anywhere. Not on their reciepts nor online. It definitely leaves a door open for them to change/say whatever they want and not be held to an actual policy. Forever 21. PLEASE create and actual return policy and PLEASE make it accessible to customers via reciepts ans online!!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Now I know why this forever 21 location is rated so poorly. They literally took FOREVER to answer my simple question when I called. Actually, she left me on hold for 14+ minutes & finally I just hung up. She was rude to begin with. Now the line is busy & can't be reached. Hire people that actually know how to do their job. I work in costumer service as well. Not okay-<//Review>

I have been a Forever21 customer since I was in middle school (now I am 19.) I have always been content with my products, and have rarely ever returned an item (if I do, I exchange it for something that fits.)
For the past year, I have noticed a huge drop in customer service provider by the employees at the Forever21 location in Stockton. I could probably spend an hour in the store without being greeted, helped, or even looked at by the teenage/young adult employees.
Now, I am myself a cashier and returns employee for Marshalls, and every customer I am NEAR, I am supposed to greet and ask if I could be of help. When I am to check out customers, I am supposed to acknowledge my customers. Heres where Forever21 is different from Marshalls: Don't expect any customer service. Any.
On the last two occasions I have visited Forever21, i have had horrible experiences with the careless staff.
My first horrible experience, I was shopping with my boyfriend (it was my birthday, so he took me shopping for my presents.) i had Eleven items to try on, and they let me enter the dressing room with Nine items. The other two were "hung by the associate on my dressingroom door." No, they weren't. If they were - someone took them off my door and misplaced them. I asked an associate why my items were misplaced and all she said was "i dont know, i hung them on your door." I asked another associate if she saw the items, but she was rude and would only repeat "they were on the door." No help to locate my items, or even apologize for the issue. I left the store angry at their horrible and zero attempts at customer service.
I visited the same store with my mother in the hopes of finding a swimsuit. I tried it on in the fittingrooms, but I wasn't too sure on the swimsuit. When I walked up to the registers, BEFORE PURCHASING MY ITEM, I asked what the store policy was on Returning Swimsuits. My cashier, Caitlin, told me I had thirty days to return the items with the tags still attached and unworn. Then, she double-checked with a so-called manager, and she told me the same thing Caitlin did. So, I went on with purchasing the swimsuit.
A week later, on July 8th, I went to the store to return the swimsuit. Cashier Wendy would not accept my return for "sanitary reasons", even though I explained to her what employees had told me. She said in that case, she could only return the swim top as a favor of customer service. Ha! Wendy was so rude to begin with, my boyfriend asked for the Manager. Wendy CLAIMED she was the MANAGER, and told us that there was nothing she could do for the mistakes of her employees (whom clearly needed to be taught the store policies). We left the store and immediately called it from the parkinglot. Wendy picked up, and we asked for a manager. She never oncr revealed she was the manager, and instead put us on hold for the REAL STORE MANAGER. But Wendy put us on hold for fove minutes and nobody ever answered. We called back, and they blamed their rude customer service on how busy the store was (which it wasnt - we were just in there.) Finally reaching the manager, she complately apologized for Wendys behavior and told me I could come back and return my swim suit bottoms for a store credit, since they do accept unwanted returns "sometimes." i went in there to return my item and the manager asked for my information/I.D. like I was turning in stolen items (I had the receipt which was the only thing I needed to make a return at Forever21.) After giving them my information (which I feel was completely unnecessary) they issued my store credit.
Never setting foot in the Stockton Forever21 ever again, and I will strongly consider ever shopping at the retailer again.< /Text>

On April 3, 2015 I sent a message to Forever 21's Facebook page regarging the situation at the store located at the Weberstown Mall in Stockton, CA. Here is an excerpt of what I wrote:

"I am utterly disappointed and disgusted with the appearance of one of your stores in Stockton, CA. I went there on Monday, March 30, 2015 and found the store disgustingly dirty and chaotic. Every single time I went there one would think that the customers are just plain disrespectful and ghetto to wreck havoc into a store and pity the workers who would have to clean and re-arrange them every hour, every day.

But as I came back to the same store on Thursday, April 2, 2015, it was still the same mess. The thing that led me to think that it is the employees and not the customers who are disgusting. There are dust bunnies all over the store.. Yes, dust bunnies. Those little furry clumps of dust do not grow overnight. Not only that. Pieces of tissue paper can be found all over the floor, broken hangers, jewelry and clothing and electrical plugs where people can trip on. A shelf for $3.90 short sleeved tees is overrun by an enormous pile of knitted leggings and not a shirt could be found in that mess.

I am attaching pictures that I took to prove what I am talking about. Also, check the facebook page of Forever21 Stockon and read the  the reviews. Another customer has posted about the mess last year and it seems like it has been and will be an on going problem if nothing is to be done."

---End of excerpt---

Then on June 28, 2015 I visited again the store. It is still as filthy as it looked last time. Nothing changed except for the worst.

Do you guys even know how filthy a dust bunny is? They are small clumps of dust that form under furniture and in corners that are not cleaned regularly. They are made of hair, lint, dead skin, spider webs, dust, and sometimes light rubbish and debris, and are held together by static electricity and felt-like entanglement

From what I observed the employees never mopped or swept the floor in years! That is disgusting. And with all the clothes on the floor that they put back on the racks full of dust just send shivers to my spine.

The Facebook page of Forever 21 responded by saying: "We've issued these complaints to our upper management team and we certainly look forward to finding resolve. We'll be contacting you soon regarding this matter. Thanks so much again!"

They never contacted me nor resolved the problem. I don't even know if this was reported to the upper management. And I don't think it will take 2 months to resolve this problem.

Have I ever told an employee about my concerns? NO. I don't think it is rocket science to figure out how disgusting a store is.

From,
Somebody who used to love the brand but now feels disgusted by it.</review>

<text>I had a great experience at Porsche Marin. Ethan provided 5 star service and helped me find my dream car. He was patient and explained each car I was looking at in detail. He even called to check in on my purchase a few days after I got the car. I highly recommend getting your next car at Porsche Marin.</text>< Pictures>

By far the best experience I’ve had in purchasing a car.  Andrew is knowledgeable, professional, and willing to help wherever he can.  The price of the car was fair and hassle free - as was the paperwork necessary to complete the transaction  A very unusual occurrence in my 60 years plus of purchasing cars. Accolades go to management and the team necessary to make a big difference in purchasing a car - especially to Andrew<//text>

<Review>Price Jessup was our sales agent and provided excellent service and responsiveness without any pushiness. He took a tremendous amount of time training us on the car's operation. It was the best experience we've had with a car purchase.<//Review><Time>1618292649721</Time><pictures>None< /pictures>< userid>

I recently had a campaign on my Cayenne. Gary couldn't of been more accommodating. Danny the lead tech answered all my questions. When I came to pick it I was greeted by a very nice girl named Lili. The car was washed and ready to go. While I was there I stopped in by the parts department and pick up some goodies. Overall I would give them a 10. See you next time.< /Review>

< review>
I would highly recommend Porsche Marin to anyone considering a Porsche.  Ethan was the sales adviser who helped me every step of the way through my purchase.  I felt I got a fair price for a new Cayenne GTS, without having  to negotiate back and forth, I let Ethan know what I wanted and he delivered.  They also worked with me on getting a fair trade in on my 911, Ben took the time to explain how they come up with their number, where they could help, and I was happy in the end.  My buying experience here was many levels above an east bay dealership I first went to as far as their professionalism and follow-up.  Do your due diligence and talk to Porsche Marin before making any final decision, Ethan is great to work with.<//review>

<Review>This was my first experience having a Porsche and taking it in for service.

I found this dealership to professional and friendly. Gary Wright is a great service advisor to deal with and gave me confidence that things would be handled properly.

Since my Cayman is used, I wanted assurance that the vehicle is in good shape.
Gary worked with me on a plan to bring it up to speed.

Happy to have landed at this dealership.< /Review></record>

I have been going to Sonnen since 1981 when they were in San Rafael. I have always received superior service in that time. In the last 10 years, the service manager at Sonnen Porsche, Mr. Gary Wright, has always given me outstanding, courteous and efficient service.

A special thanks to Porsche Marin, and especially service advisor Weis Popal, for  coming to our rescue when engine exhaust issues stranded us while vacationing far from our home in Oregon. Weis was able to work us into a very heavy service work schedule, diagnose the issue, order parts flown in from Germany, fix the problem and get us on our way home with a minimum of delay.  He also kept his fully informed on the status of our Cayenne diesel during the process. We consider this going above and beyond what we would normally expect and are very grateful!!< /Text>

From the moment I rolled up to the service bay and was immediately greeted in a socially-distant manner, the Porsche Marin team was as friendly and efficient as could be. When dealing with other service centers, I am used to making an appointment, then explaining my needs as if from scratch when I show up. Not so here. Gary Wright remembered the car (and my father’s name) without referring to his notes, confirmed the work we had scheduled, and got me out of there. Throughout the day, he kept me apprised on his progress, and the car’s annual service was completed by mid-afternoon. Even pickup was a breeze, paying in advance via mobile app which meant I spent less than 5 minutes back at the service center. Exceptional from start to finish. Well done, Gary, and well done Porsche Marin!<//text>

<Text>The service is top notch. Car was towed in to the service department without my presence. They were thorough in making sure I was aware they had it and that the car was safe. Then, they thoroughly analyzed the problem, and fixed it completely. All the while, Gary, my service advisor, kept me fully advised of each step. Great service. Definitely use them again.<//Text>< user_id>

On a road trip from San Diego going up the coast, I made an appointment about a week prior for a wheel/tire swap on my GT4.
Making the appointment was easy online. Had good followup through text which I appreciated.

I was about 30 min early, and they didn't seem to mind. I was put with Weis Popal as my advisor. Explained to him the scenario- I'm from out of town, in a slight hurry, another customer would be dropping off a set of wheels that I wanted to put on the car so I just needed the tires and TPMS from my current wheels swapped over. Easy enough.

Not only did it they have a quick turnaround time, but Weis went above and beyond to keep me in the loop during the process.

But where he far exceeded my expectations from ANY dealer was his help and generosity with providing me a space and direct help with facilitating the packing and shipping of my other set of wheels. He even casually involved some behind the scenes people to make sure I was set up and taken care of.

I no longer do- but as I had previously worked for over a decade in the car world, specifically high end dealerships, I know that this sort of assistance and customer care is not only rare- but virtually non existent. Almost always falling over to the "Not any of my business" type of mentality. He made it his business. Not only did this dramatically decrease the time I had to spend on this project, but made it exponentially more convenient for me on my trip.

This is the level of customer service you would expect from a brand like Porsche, and I'm sure they are happy to have someone like Mr. Popal be the face that assists their clients. Thank you again.</text>

Brought my Cayenne in for a major service. Geoff was very professional and responded quickly to questions. He was also very transparent and accommodating when an unexpected issue with the powerplant came up. He explained the issue in enough detail without being patronizing about the consequences of leaving the problem unresolved. Would bring back for future maintenance.< /Review>

Can’t speak more highly about the service we received from Porsche Marin during our recent buying experience. From opening the dealership door for us during our first visit to closing the deal, the service provided by Xavier Marmier was truly fantastic.

This was our first time buying a Porsche, and Xavier invested the time to educate us and answer all our questions to ensure we were making the most informed buying decision possible. He even found a car seat from a storage closet for us to test out how one fits in the back of a Macan (it fits). He showed a lot of patience with us and wasn’t even the slightest bit pushy during the buying experience.

Xavier’s professionalism was outstanding - a true gentleman. We are happy customers and will definitely be purchasing our next vehicle at Porsche Marin again, when the time comes. Definitely recommend this dealership and Xavier!<//text>

<Text>Great staff at Marin Porsche, everyone is warm and friendly. Paul and Michael are very knowledgeable of their vehicles. They worked with me throughout the process, it was around a month between the time I first walked into the dealership and the time I actually purchase. Paul and I had several phone conversations most of the calls initiated by me. He wanted me to be comfortable with the choice I was making he's a no pressure salesperson. I would definitely recommend him if anyone is looking to buy a Porsche.

This week, I Ubered to Marin Porsche because I was frustrated with the constant service issues and quality issues I had with my Tesla Model S.

Thankfully, I met Derrell Brushaber at Marin Porsche. He helped my girlfriend and I pick the perfect car for us, The Taycan Turbo.

Derrell is knowledgeable, helpful, and focuses on adding value. We felt so comfortable with him we got the car the same day and drove it home. No need to think about it because Derrell gave us space to feel comfortable and didn’t try to push us.

Yesterday, my two boys and I went back to see Derrell and he patiently spent an hour with us making sure we understood how the car worked. He even asked my boys if they had questions and answered them!

Then, I went home and was struggling with the charger at my building. Derrell said “I’m coming over to help!” He then drove  to SF from Marin and solved the problem instantly. The issue was with the charge point cable. He even knew a trick to make it work!

THIS is what service is all about. We are so happy with the car and with Derrell! Derrell is a crusher!<//text>

I had the pleasure of purchasing a used M3 from him today and things were easy from the beginning.  He let me take the car on an unsupervised test drive, and then we worked the numbers in a relaxed matter.

Even doing the final paperwork with their finance lady (sorry, I don't know your name!) was one of my better experiences.  No pushiness when it came to add-on warranties and such.

The dealership was clean and had a pleasant open airiness to it.

If I decide to upgrade to a Porsche next time, I'll definitely be back.<//Text>< Pictures>

Service department is pleasant and professional appearance, but had problems solving our problem.  We had regular service but Porsche Marin could not diagnose/fix our overheating problem.  We researched online and found there are some problems with louvers over the radiator not opening.  We brought it back and that turned out to be the problem so they fixed it.  It would be much better to have a mechanic who can diagnose problems instead of having customers do it.< /text>

Amazing cars (new or used). Competent, straightforward, upfront sales staff. Laughably inept administration. What should have been 30 mins of purchase doc signing took 2 hours. But, no surprises, totally happy with the car. Long story short: fast cars; slow admin.< /text>

Porsche Marin provides one of the most convenient and communicative approaches to service, that I’ve ever experienced.  They keep you in the loop and make every step of the way as frictionless as possible.  On top of that, as longtime customer, Gary worked with Porsche N.A. to lower my repair costs - doesn’t get any better than that!

Thank you for another A+ experience, Gary (and team)!<//Review>< pics>

Simply the best dealer I’ve ever dealt with so far. They are fast to understand and they adapt to your pace, making the purchasing experience extremely straightforward and pleasant. I highly recommend Andrew and Ritsa. I literally came over just to sign the paperwork and I was out in about a record time of one hour. I also got much appreciated Porsche swag. Wish I could put more than 5 stars.< /Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>They posted a used 911 for sale. I went in to see it. The first thing the salesman said (he shall remain nameless) was that we only sell high quality used cars, otherwise they go to a dealer auction. He pointed out that one headlight was new looking and the other one was old because the owner must have replaced one on his own and that you just need to buff it out. He also pointed out that the rear bumper was slightly dented/cracked but that you can just paint over it, it was nothing. My wife noticed that the passenger side door had water damage on the inside, but he said it is very minor and that it is expected in an older car that is a convertible.  We sat down and I asked to see the carfax. He let me look it over while he went to get a key for another car we wanted to see. The 911 had 6 previous owners and showed that the front end had significant damage. When the salesman came back I said it's a no on the 911 because of the 6 owners and damage. He said oh the rear end bumper is slight but, ok. I said, no, the damage is in the front end. He looked at me like a deer in headlights. He changed the subject... This is why there is one new headlight and one old! They only sell high quality used cars here? My a**. The kicker is that today I noticed they are auctioning it off on eBay. They don't mention or show the damage or offer a carfax. Totally shady to say the least. I wasn't going to review them but since they are auctioning it on eBay with no disclosure of owners and damage, well, here it is. I will never buy a Porsche here.< /review>< Time>

<Review>My car was dirty after being in the shop for over three weeks. No one checked to see if it had been cleaned. When I complained they sent it back to be cleaned and when it returned after my waiting over twenty minutes I was told that some of the problem was water stains and if I wanted to pay another $500 I could pick it up tomorrow.
I explained that it had sent my ride home and needed the car for that purpose. I was not offered a loaner so that this could happen if I wanted it to.
I then proceeded to point out all the areas that hadn’t been cleaned and the Weis, my service person apologized and said that they outsourced the cleaning. He then took a rag and started to clean it himself.
There obviously was no one that checked my car before releasing it to me. What is more, it needed gas as it was on empty. I am not sure if I brought it in empty since it was almost a month since I last sat in it. A call to me asking me if I wanted it to be filled would have been important or even just adding two gallons would have been nice.
I feel as though this whole experience was disrespectful and I am outraged.
I drove home with smudges from what had to be from the dirty rag that was used to clean my windows.
The inside of my car had finger prints over many surfaces.</Review>< Pictures>

I had a very good experience at Porsche Marin. The sales person worked with me for a long while and talked about what I wanted with me. I saw a car I liked and test drove it. I was actually expecting to take a bit longer to find a car I liked at this price point. I went back the following day and bought it.  The process always takes too long at the dealer but I’m very happy with the results.

I have had my first visit to the service department. I had picked up a nail in a tire. They took care of it and provided Lyfts to and from my home while they had my car.  I expect to use them for all my service needs.<//text>

Had a great experience working with Andrew and the Marin team. Had originally looked at a specific car in the inventory that sold just before getting there to see it, but he showed me another, even better model, gave me a great deal with no hassle or hidden agenda and I left same day with my dream car Macan Turbo! They were extremely friendly, safe and he even included a future full detail for my car since it was a little dirty as I left! Can’t wait to be able to buy my next Porsche!</review>

A difficult period to be waiting for something to ship from Germany. But car has now arrived and Brett at Marin Porsche has been awesome from day one: easy going good natured and honest about the good and the bad on the cars. Great experience and I would recommend buying from there.<//Review>

<Time>1604182164466<//Time><rating>5<//rating><Review>I had a wonderful experience with Geoff Arcuri.  He was receptive to my needs and took great care of our 911.  I must say that the quality of service has gone up under the new ownership.  My husband met Peter Sonnen in the showroom once.  Mr. Sonnen turned his back and walked away when he realized we were having an issue with the service received.  An owner that disconnected from what makes a business successful should retire. This was our first experience since that and we are looking forward to more. Thanks Geoff!<//Review>< pics>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Bought ding package and as I said upfront and which held true, it basically covers nothing. The sales guy assured me it would and the service manager of course said my dings were not covered. Total scam and I called to discontinue it and of course I can’t as long as I have the lease. I expected more from Porsche but all car companies are the same. Horrible!<//Text>< pics>

Brought my car in for a recall. One of the mechanics damaged the car while it was there and it had to be repainted, which took over a week. Not excited to go back and may opt for an independent repair shop next time if I need any service.</Review>

Sales agent Price Jessup and finance manager Ritsa Shone at Porsche were great to deal with. Price was very knowledgeable when it came to the Panamera Hybrid and worked out a great deal.  After negotiating a price suitable for me,  Ritsa had my paper work ready to sign and I was done quickly and off driving my new panamera!< /review>

My first time at a Porsche dealer near us was a total disaster! Sales person could not be bothered. We wanted to test drive a Macan S but they did not have one , but did not even offer to call me when they had one. So guess what they lost a customer for good.
On the other hand Porsche Marin was the total opposite. They found what I wanted in a Macan S in the perfect color combo and made a deal.  We were lucky to have Paul and Stephen work with us and the transaction was flawless.
Thanks ! I will certainly refer friends and family to meet these professional sales people.</Review>

I recently bought a used Porsche from a non Porsche dealership and wanted to have it inspected.

It first started with the receptionist at the front desk.  Great attitude and very helpful getting me to the right person.

Then I was connected to Gary.  I explained to him what was going on he contacted me back what he came out with.

Great group of people at Marin Porsche</Review>

<Text>Very disappointed that some of the basic works that were supposed to be done were not done. I was charged $7,244 and it appears that not every part that was supposed to be repaired was fixed. Am I suppose to her under the hood and inspect everything? If so, why am I paying Porsche Marin more than $7,000 to do so? Very disappointed< /Text>< rating>

<Text>My visit to Marin Porsche is always a wonderful experience. The staff is extremely nice and so friendly. They all wear a smile, which is a confident characterization of being in a great atmosphere. Bill is the best, he always comes out of his office to greet the customers in the morning. Gary is a charmer, as well. I really enjoyed the opportunity he gave me to experience such an amazing car; the New Taycan. The experience was amazing. This dealership is always a great visit for me. Thanks Marin Porsche.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I have been a client of Porsche Marin for the past 13 years and have generally been very happy with the quality of service provided by their Service Department.  Furthermore, I have been very pleased with the service provided by Gary Wright, who has been my service advisor for the past several years.  I highly recommend their service department, and in particular Gary Wright, to any Marin Porsche owners seeking maintenance and repair services.<//review>

<user_id>107497105135698025099<//user_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>Really seamless experience at Porsche Marin- went to test drive a CPO Macan S, and ended up buying it later that day.  Ethan was especially helpful in fielding questions and ensuring everything was taken care of. Since I came alone (and live about an hour away), I needed the car delivered to me. I also was anxious about waiting for the delivery as my wife was 39 weeks pregnant and due in a few days. Ethan and the team went above and beyond to get the car to me in the east bay the very next day. He also followed up with me just to touch base and take any questions I had around getting acclimated with the car. Was nice to be treated with great customer service and our family is now enjoying our Macan!< /review></record></dataset><record>

I worked with Paul at Porsche Marin and had a wonderful experience. He was off on the day I came in to purchase the car he showed me but Brett helped me out and we were off with my new car in a little over an hour. Their customer service is the best and everyone there genuinely cares about their customers. Nothing but good things to say about Porsche Marin!<//text>

You earned my 5 stars. I wish I can give y'all more stars! You gotta love STEALERSHIPS because they ALL equally treat you the SAME. Ask Andrew you'll see what I mean! He's just awesome! Go talk to him he has it all and you'll see why! From his anger reactions, impatient attitude, dishonesty, pushy impersonation, and most of all a poor self esteem! It makes me really rethink about my future purchases that much more and my values. Thank you for reading! Good luck and god bless you all! Especially you Andrew!!</Text>

<Time>1590793179612<//Time><Name>Chris Jones<//Name><pictures>None</pictures><Review>Very grateful they could get my car in after an emergency situation, and provide me with a loaner car for the week. The service guy was pleasant and thoughtful, although didn’t return my calls well, forcing me to call repeatedly to reach him. Because my situation was an emergency, I fully understood their not being able to get it into the shop for three days, and was grateful that once they could look at it, they devoted ample time to diagnosing and fixing the problem. However, when I arrived (six days after originally dropping off my car) to pick it up, after calling ahead that I was coming, I had to wait 45 minutes for them to process the paperwork, wash the car and bring it up, only to discover that all my seat and radio settings had been altered. Not the level of service I expected, and certainly not the level I experienced when Peter Sonnen was at the helm.

My next service was significantly better—in and out in two days and everything taken care of. Very grateful!< /Review>< Response>

This is the 3rd 911 and the 4th car I have leased from Brett Payne. Brett knows his cars and is easy to get along with. He speaks very directly and is very helpful and professional. I will keep using his service as long as he is with Porsche

Thank you so much for your A+ service.

Destiny, the front desk secretary, was so kind and gracious throughout the day.
I am also so thankful for the two gentleman who dropped off and picked up my son and I at the shopping center as we waited for the services on our car to be done.

And PS the car wash was so nice!

Top notch service.<//Review>

From the minute I showed up I noticed how busy the location was and while I'm not a typical customer I was concerned that they would not be intrested in helping me in a timely fashion. Since I am the owner of an independent service & repair facility which usually dealerships don't like to help whatsoever. That was not the case with the friendly folks at Porsche of Marin as both Dan McNamee and Chelsea where quick to help and get me back on the road as if I just bought a 911 GT3. Honesty,Transparency and Integrity are things that have simply been lost everywhere else but that's not the case with Porsche of Marin.
Thanks from German Auto Sport in Berkeley< /Text>

The service experience did not meet what we expect from Porsche. We made a reservation weeks in advance and were told the service would take about an hour. When we arrived at 9 am and were told they were running behind, so it would be 2 hours. When we came back after 2 hours they said the car would not be ready for at least another hour. After 3 hours, they said we could have our car back but it would not be washed. For a company that prides itself on service, they missed the mark.<//review>

Had a great experience here for my 2 year check up! Everyone was extremely courteous and kind. The lounge was comfortable, clean and had a good selection of snacks (should you choose to stay and wait) They offer a shuttle service to local areas (such as the shopping center/mall in Corte Madera, and if their drive is not available, they call you a lift)   The 2 year check up was about a 3-4 hour turn around time, which was perfect for me to do a bit of perusing in the area.  If you do end up at Corte Madera, I did notice cell reception was really poor (or non-existant) within the stores-- Porsche both called, texted me, and left a voice mail when they were done, I really appreciated that! Over-all was very pleased with my experience.<//review>

The staff is friendly and helpful in person and on the phone. Their cost and wait time estimates were accurate. The waiting room is comfortable although a shuttle service was offered too. I'll be returning for future maintenance.< /Review>< Pics>

Beautiful cars. Limited selection on hand. Lots of Panameras and convertibles. Sales folks weren't interested in me. I wasn't in there to buy anyway. "I guess" shouldn't be used by sales people of 100k+ machines, just saying.< /Text>

I worked with Brett and he was a pleasure to work with. From start to finish it was a breeze. He was extremely knowledgeable about all things Porsche. He gave me advice on what to add and what wasn’t worth it. Things I had no idea about (the smoker package because it’s basically an extra outlet to charge your phone-even though I don’t smoke) Also, his accent is a bonus! :) I would 10/10 recommend going to him for any future Porsche purchases.< /review>

Great service. It’s always a delight to get my 911 serviced at Sonnen … to see the new & used models for sale, the toy Porsche’s, eat the snacks, look at the cars being serviced, the great wash job especially the wheels… & this time, see the awesome 918 Hybrid.< /review>

<Text>I just bought a used car from Porche Marin and my experience with car buying part is acceptable but the financing part  is awful.  They  would get you for every dollar they can.
I manage my finances well and it’s rewarded with an excellent credit score. The sales person quoted a rate and said “if you have a good credit score, the rate will be better”. I made a mistake of believing him and agreed to complete the purchase.
When They completed the paperwork and ready for me to sign the documents the rate was the same as quoted earlier and when I asked the closing agent, she said it’s all done and she cannot change it and suggested I refinance the loan later as to redo the paperwork is additional work for her. I could have refused to sign the paperwork but I did not have patience to argue with them.
The reason I go to these established car dealers to buy my cars is I believed they are professional and will not squeeze  the customers. I am wrong with that belief about Porche Marin. I would never recommend doing business with them. Their financing team is the worst.< /Text>< pics>

<review>I purchased a pre-owned 2011 Carrera S from Porsche Marin. My salesman, Brett Payne, advised me that if I wanted to buy the car I should act quickly because this car would not last. I took his advice, test drove the car and decided to purchase it. Brett was friendly and quite knowledgeable about the Porsche brand. The transaction went smoothly and without pressure, which I appreciate greatly. I will certainly do more business with Porsche Marin because of the product and of the salesman that they employ.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Reading through these comments I can’t help but to think some people are just spoiled and think that the staff needs to Hand feed them also,I’ve owed several cars from sonnen Porsche and only have gotten A1 service I’ve recommended all my Porsche family friends to also go to sonnen and they always get treated A1 as well.thank u Bill for the professionalisms u always show us Michael and Steven both work together on getting us deals and they never complain about anything they are both professionals our service advisor Dan is a class act
He never has ever said we can’t do that he really knows how to get things done.<//Text>

I am an out of state buyer (Seattle), I found my dream car at Marin Porsche......I was told there was no way I could purchase the car CASH and drive home to Seattle it was not legal. This delayed the deal to arrange transport. Worked the deal all week, with clear communication i want the car. The GM of Marin Porsche contacted a friend of his to look at the car on Saturday. I was told all of the sudden I CAN DRIVE it home after purchase after a week being told no and they were wrong (I would have flown down Wednesday if I could drive home)...BUT now I have to wait for the GMs friend to get first choice, I got bumped for his friend....They sold the car to the GMs friend....I have never felt so used as a pawn. Dream car buyers....please beware. Find the sales person who knows out of state sales with a GM with ethics and an ounce of integrity.<//text>

<text>This is my first Porsche. I have owned many Mercedes since 1994. I always dreaded taking my car for service. I alway felt like another number bringing my car in. I was weary with Porsche. However my feelings were changed at Marin Porsche. From the pleasant front desk admins, to my service advisor Gary, and support techs, they proved that Porsche is not just a racing badge, but are there to make sure the job is done right and you leave loving your Porsche ready for the world.< /text><Response>{'time': 1528735476201, 'text': 'Thanks for taking the time to write this review Sharon, we appreciate your business!'}</Response></record>

<Text>Everyone was polite and there was help yourself refreshments and entertainment which I’m not use to at a Porsche dealership. I’ve owned Porsche’s for almost 25 years and never had this level of service by my local dealer. I had to drive and hour to get to Marin Porsche but it was worth the experience.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>We received prompt and professional service from Gary Wright in the service department. We were given a diagnosis which we expected to cost us dearly. It resulted in zero expenses. Imagine my surprise and pleasure.

Very disappointed with their services for the second time! Zero attention received while visited this office yesterday! Service desk ignored me for about 10 minutes, seemed very busy with their conversations while other staff was sitting in their cubes not paying attention to client! Seems like their care more about their reviews as i got very quick respond on my negative review here!<//Text>

After searching U.S. for Audi S5, low mileage & $30K budget, finally found at Sonnen Porsche. Michael Gray (sales) checked with manager and said they accept our offer (even beat the best deal on CarGurus website). We drove same day and bought wife's dream car, clean report, 1 owner, well-maintained. Michael was professional and humorous, absolutely no pressure to buy.
Emil (finance) was courteous and professional. Some bank pre-approval confusion, but found similar APR % and went with another bank. Finally, bought extended warranty, good rating on BBB website. But after researching more quotes, nearly canceled warranty purchased. Emil was patient and worked to extend warranty terms for similar price.
Excellent customer service! Although we bought an Audi, maybe we'll buy Porsche next at Sonnen. Best car dealership experience we ever had! Thank you.</Review>

This is a great car dealership.  Not just the obvious (lots of people like Porsche cars)- but the people/service and way they run the business. I'll not spend much time on the he quality of car and the online research available.  Buying a car whereby there are many options beyond base is seen by some as price add-on but it is also a way to only pay for what you want and get personal value.  It is easy to use the online configurator and the dealership is helpful with nuances as well as hands on so you can make the right choice (example, try the various sound system or seats before you order or see colors, etc). The car is worth the wait from Germany- it is apparent there is a lot of thought in the design and the result is a great driving car.  The various departments at the dealership are well-integrated (sales, finance, service) and get to know you and really work hard at solving your needs.  They go the extra mile to get things done right and appreciated you as a customer. This is my 4th German car and the best vehicle and dealership.  Well-oiled machines/Highly recommended.< /text>

< Review>
I cannot really praise Brett Payne @ Sonnen/Marin Porsche too highly.

Too often when you interact with a Sales Guy, even a Porsche Sales guy, you look back on the experience wondering in what creative way they screwed you?

This is *not* the case with Brett, I have bought one 911 from him, and thanks to his honesty and diligence, I have just ordered another.

What distinguished Brett from other salesman? Firstly he loves the cars,
when Brett specifies car car for the show floor, you can expect that he
has not simply loaded it with expensive options, but he has ordered a
car that he, or another 911 aficionado would order.

Secondly, he's honest and professional; when you interact with him, you know that what he's telling you is fact, not fiction, spin, false news, or
simply what you want to hear in order to get the sale!

I honestly did not think when I put my deposit on my new 911, that being #13 on the list I would get an allocation, but Brett assured me, that based
on past experiences, I would get one, and guess what, I did - he was right!

Brett is not your average car sales guy, he's not even your average Porsche brand ambassador, he's exemplary, he will continue to get my business and my highest recommendation possible...

Brett (and Gary Wright in the service dept) are the reason that Sonnen get my highest recommendation, and continued business.

Its the only bay area dealership that I would recommend, never mind recommend without reservation!< /Review>

I will attach pictures to prove and back up my case.

I've order the products in back in 11/05/18 but as of today(12/13/18)
I still don't have my order. Called multiple times never get any type of good clear answer.
It took them 30 days to ship out the products and now package got lost with Fedex.

Biggest PROBLEM with this dealership is they do not know what they have in their inventory and just taking orders.
I wish they have better customer service.
Our family bought 2012 Panamera and 2015 Macan  and now I can say they lost our business forever and I will do my very best to share my horrible experienced with friends, business partners and locals that who is willing to do business with this dealership</Review></record>

<review>One of the things that make Sonnen a great place are the people.   I was driving a new (to me) 911 from Santa Rosa to San Diego on a Saturday afternoon, when a Cooling System Warning Message showed up on the computer.   I called from the road and got through to Andrew Ratto, who put me at ease right away by saying, "just bring it in, and we'll take a look".   Keep in mind, it's Saturday afternoon, around 1:30p.   I roll up, Andrew takes the car into the service bay and his technician figure out the problem (missing hose), repair it, and send me on my way in 90 minutes.  The team really delivered the kind of responsiveness and service we, as customers always hope for.   Sonnen service really delivered.

The sales side is also outstanding.  If you are interested in seeing Porsches configured in unique and creative ways, this is the place to go.  Beautiful color combinations, incredible interior designs...no other Porsche dealer I have seen does this as well.  Ask for Brett Payne and get him to show you what awesome looks like.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1446480535687, 'text': 'Thank you Larry!  This is an awesome review.

<Text>I drove almost 70 miles each way because the price for labor here was literally half what Livermore Porsche wanted. I only have a lowly Boxster and don't want to pay double to get the exact same thing, it's a dealer and that's all I needed. Also the price for parts  beats both Walnut Creek and Livermore both for the same thing. I did have a tiny problem in that the price I was given online and on the phone was not the same as the in store pricing but they did honor it after I explained I only drove the 70 miles because of that price and was told they had my parts in stock. It was not the fastest service but it was tremendously better than my local Toyota dealer is and the people seem pretty nice. Also great assortment of snacks and drinks in the waiting room. Very much worth the drive, besides I like the fact it is a smaller more intimate dealership.</Text>< pictures>

I recently bought an $80,000 CPO Cayman GTS from Marin and have had a horrid experience with some rattles from day one. Some plastic trim panels in the trunk are clearly loose and move about and I have shared videos of the rattle with the service department. In spite of this, after three months and three appointments they have not been able to fix the problem.

Let me be clear - Andrew is awesome, he helped me a ton even after I bought the car from him. Gary, Adam and the technicians are amazing - they go out of their way to help you, as much as possible.

However the new service director, Kevin is clueless, arrogant and unprofessional. He comes from VW and treats customers at that level. The entire service department seems under tremendous pressure and it takes two to three weeks to just get an appointment. It takes less time to get an appointment with my doctor at Stanford!

Because of this mis-management, when you finally bring your car in they are slow and do a half-hearted job. I recently brought my car in a third time to fix the same rattle and Kevin kept my car for eight days. He promised he’d have the foreman look at it but when I finally collected the car absolutely nothing had been fixed. To add insult to injury he told me some BS stories but the GPS tracker on my car clearly shows my car stayed parked and they did no test drives to isolate or fix the core issue. By the way, I always had to call and check-in since I recd. no courtesy updates from his side. Like I said, clueless, arrogant and unprofessional. Instead of enjoying my car I will now have to follow up with Porsche North America about all of this.

Other things I didn’t appreciate. After you buy a car or after a service they will pressurize you to give them great reviews. I can also vouch, like some other reviews, that their receptionists and some others can be uptight and rude. A lot of people who work here don’t seem too happy or professional in general and it maps to a negative experience.

My perception of Porsche has changed thanks to Porsche Marin. Almost every Porsche dealership in the Bay Area has better reviews. Take your hard earned money elsewhere.</Review>

<Review>Just bought my third Porsche over the years for my wife at Sonnen Porsche.
My sales rep Andrew Proaps and his manager Jun Perez, were attentive to our needs, knowledgeable and straight forward. No pressure or heavy sales tactics. She is in love with her Porsche. Yay<//Review>< pics>

I see all these 0 ratings based on cost.  Last time I checked we are talking about a Porsche dealer. These guys have always taken care of what was needed, leveraged the warranty to the fullest and have my C4S working like new.</Review>

<review>Horrible experience.
*Car was in for insurance claim
*There were no follow ups from Tristen until a complaint was made to service manager by the name of Andrew. He apologized and said he'll call back in a couple of hours to follow up with the status on my car. One day went by and I had to call him back he admitted that he forgot to call back. Told me he had to order parts. One story led to another. Was told car to be completed in one to two weeks. Three weeks later car is not completed. Service manager Andrew made me felt stupid by telling me I need to learn and understand shipping is out of his control. Even though he promised me a certain time frame. I am a Store Manager for Firstone and I understand things will and can take some time but don't promise a customer a certain time frame where they had to make arrangements to another location that needs other work done to the car and than you had to cancel with them. To top it off he was so sure the work was completed the day I arrived to pick up the car demanding payment. Just to find out he lost old parts and the job was only half way done. These are legitimate complaints and I'm sorry Sonnen Porsche I didn't Purchase a car from you. Maybe my experience would of been better if I did. I will escalate this issue.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<user_name>Rochelle D< /user_name><Pics>None<//Pics><Review>Awful experience.  You’d think they’d put the staff through a beginners customer service training...not only does the sales team lack the necessary people skills for a customer to have a positive experience but to top it off the financial team is arrogant, and frankly rude.  I own a GTS Macan, and a 911 Turbo and because I walked in in sweats after the gym no one greeted me and the salesperson who I finally approached, Paul, told me after 5 minutes that he had to go to another customer a gentleman who walked in with a suit.  After 30 minutes he did not make any attempt to help me further.  At that point I approached Andrew who then gave me the same experience.  They lost an opportunity to deserve my money, now and forever.  I hope all Marin residents refer to this as a suggestion to not support an inadequate business like this place.  It’s money well Spent and a better lasting experience on both sides of the transaction if you make the further drive to a different dealership.  Not impressed Porsche Marin. Drove to Porsche of Monterey where I found that the gt3 I wanted was nearly 15k less than marin told me.  Financial team Emil told me at marin that “I’m not sure you can afford this vehicle.  Usually it’s for elite business people and celebrities”....this statement was solely based on the fact that I went in after going to the gym and I was in workout clothes.  When I showed proof of funds he snickered and became extremely fake polite. Left such a bad taste in my mouth but anyway my order is in and my Porsche will arrive in 6-8 weeks.  Thanks to Porsche Monterey.< /Review><rating>1</rating>< time>

<Text>Porsche Marin, formerly known as Sonnen Porsche, is truly the best place to get your Porsche. The whole buying experience is critical to me -- I don't want to feel bad parting with my money, and one little misstep is all it takes to ruin the whole experience. After a few experiences with Porsche Marin, I can confidently say that I will not trust anyone else with my dreams.

Now, having said all of this, it's worth noting that Brett Payne is my Porsche guy. Period. He is a die hard enthusiast, just like me, and is not a sales guy -- he operates more like an agent, in that he facilitates my transaction, he never "sells" me anything (I walk in already sold on what I want). His sense on building cars is impeccable, as well. He's often steered me away from bad (options) choices, or towards good options to add -- I know a lot about a lot, but it's hard to truly know everything. Brett makes it all easy for me.

In terms of guys I've worked with or interacted with, there are many other top notch guys on the Sonnen team: Emil Rustamov (Finance Director), Bill Lamphere (General Manager), and Mr. Peter Sonnen himself. All are class acts.

I'm heavily biased in that I've had many positive experiences at Porsche Marin. Hopefully yours are equally positive, but obviously like anything else in life, your mileage may vary. Drop Brett a note (his email is on their staff page on their website) and have him help you with your dream -- just don't be an annoying client, please! Otherwise, I'll regret recommending him. ;)</Text>< Gmap_id>

<user_name>C4S 2009 (Mike)</user_name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>Professional, Honesty, Trustworthy and Responsive are some of the attributes that comes to mind for Michael Gray, the Porsche Brand Ambassador at Sonnen Porsche.  I recently purchased a much sought after limited production GT car from Michael.  Instead of charging over MSRP for my car like most other dealerships, Sonnen did not participate in such, in my opinion, "dishonest" behavior. Michael was truely a pleasure to deal with throughout the entire process.  I would highly recommend you to give Michael a call for your next Porsche purchase.< /text>< Time>

<text>Buy an 80k SUV, have a horrible experience with their receptionist and they will tell you not to come back. This is how Sonnen Marin works. Skip to Walnut creek. Dont waste your time. Bill the manager is about as nasty as he looks and so is Monica. When the original Sonnen Family was together this place was managed properly. Today it is worse than dealing with the DMV.  2017 Macan S< /text>< Gmap_id>

They repair again and again，keep saying your car is broken here and there. The car's value is only 20K-30K，They need $8000 to repair.  By the way it takes us around two months waiting.<//Text>
