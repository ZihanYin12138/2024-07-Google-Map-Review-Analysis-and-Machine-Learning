Le Pooch did a wonderful job grooming my standard Poodle.  We travel full time in an RV - so finding a good groomer is always a little dicey.  I was so happy with the job they did and they were very friendly and kind to my dog.  Highly recommend</Text>

<review>Great groomers! They were able to shave my dog with severe matts even after multiple groomers said they weren't able to and needed to take him to a vet. They are very reliable and helpful over the phone/text. My labradoodle comes back looking beautiful!< /review>< name>

Yes I called this groomers a month ago unfortunately due to covid-19 they were not open but the owner is extremely nice and as soon as she knew a date they were going to open she called me typical appointment because I was one of the first people to miss the stay-at-home Shelter by one day so I didn't get to have my dog groomed. Very very nice people work here</text>

I can't  really thank them enough  for taking my dogs in and be able to get them nails trimmed.  Cassandra and her coworker  did great even tho my two dos are pitbulls mix, super friendly  and scared baby's.  They did trimmed  their nails outside the building but I'm forever grateful.  Thank you ladies .< /text>

I take my dog here for washes and nail trimming. Never had a problem. Busy place with reservations recommended.< /Review>
</record></dataset><record>
< Text>
Oh how love le pooch and wonderful staff. I just took my small chihuahua there right now. And I was so happy with the service. I had taken my dog to petco to there groomers, but today he tried to nip the lady at petco. And I did not like the service. The lady at petco was so rude and telling me to go ahead and buy for the service.
And i explained everything to the lady at le pooch, and she understood.  And she then went to the back to get a lady to help me trim my dog nails, and the lady was super friendly and she asked if I wanted to put a muzzle on my dog, and then after I was done.  She gently walk toward my dog and with a gentle voice picked him up, and he did fantastic with her.   She did the most amazing awesome job on his nails. I’d ever seen anyone do. I would love to rate le pooch 100% ⭐️ stars.
Totally RECOMMEND!! Please don’t trust anywhere else. This place is outstanding.< /Text>

We made a reservation over a month ago to have our puppy groomed by them for the second time.  We were staying in San Jose.  Our appt was for 1:00 on Sat. 10/20.  Driving from San Jose we left 1 hour early for a 30 min. Drive.  We encountered traffic and hoolge told me we would be 7 min passed 1:00.  I phone at 12:33 and informed them of our delay.

Now they informed me If I was even 2 minutelate the appt would be cancelled.

Very rude on the phone, and very inconsiderate .

They will NEVER have our business they definitely need training on proper customer service.

There are much better grommers in Morgan then le goof.<//Review>

We have a 70lb German Shepherd puppy (9 months) and we have brought her to Le Pooch twice. They do a great job grooming but I do not recommend this place for larger dogs.
As a matter of fact other customers kept commenting on how large my puppy is with condescending tones. Which I thought was odd because who cares? What is it to them that I have a larger breed puppy?
My puppy was there from 11:30am to about 4pm for a de-shedding and general grooming. They warned me it would take that long so that is fine. However, my puppy was so distressed being surrounded by small yappy dogs all afternoon that when I picked her up she was going around in circles and then puked.
I cannot speak for the kennel environment my puppy was in while she waited for me to pick her up (about 15 min) but based on her behavior afterwards my guess is there were lots of yappy dogs (I could hear them from the entry way) in a confined space and based on my experience in the entry way the smells and fumes of the shampoos/products being used are not ventilated enough. I believe this led to my puppy being nauseous.
Again they did a great job with the grooming however, I would not bring a large dog there again.</text>

<Text>Very bad experience , my package was held at International custom clearance office outside US for couple weeks. The box is smaller than 12x12x12 inches and cost $200 to ship. This was just a gift to my family as they are asking to provide actual merchandise receipts, the brand name and location of purchased. These questions made me feel very uncomfortable. When I spoke to the Asian female clerk (probably at her late 20s) locally here Daly City, California, in the United States, I was instructed that FedEx insurance default to $100 minimum and to place $100 package value. Eventhough the package value is less than $15. I was not aware that International custom and FedEx will charge fee because a $100 merchandise value applied in the declaration form when it reached to its destination.
I wish the local FedEx clerk made me aware of this. They did not gave any reason why there was charge fees when I called. This is very disturbing that my package will not deliver to my family on time due to this issue. Because of this bad experience, I will not be using FedEx to ship International anymore.< /Text></record>

These employees could  really use a  class in customer service.  I was there this afternoon around 2pm and there were 3 ladies.  One who had a grey wrap on her head,she was ok but the other 2 looked like maybe she was training to print or something,those two completely ignored everyone mind you there was 2 people in one line and 3 or 4 people in another. A simple acknowledgment or greeting is all I ask because I'm not sure if maybe I'm a ghost or something because I sure seem invisible.  Of course when I go to.print it diesnt even print everything and God forbid I ask for assistance because when I asked if anyone was working counter she gave me attitude. Will never go back unless I have too.< /Text>

WORST. Customer Service. Want to be waiting a line while people over the counter look at you? Come here! They’re disrespectful and rude, can’t do their jobs right & CLEARLY untrained. Yea, I’m that upset that I had to write this review up. I should have learned from the first time I went here.< /Review>

<Text>The people are helpful and tried their best but there is lack of training and information provided.
We shipped a package to Russia for a friend's birthday present include electronics. We asked them if it is okay to ship and after looking into their manual or instruction, they said it is okay.
I paid $280 for shipping and two weeks later the package was returned to me as prohibited because of value exceed $500.
I just paid $280 for nothing but frustration.and there is no one to answer the phone no matter how many times you call. So don't bother.<//Text>< UserId.>

After having serious issues at the Foster City store, I had someone transfer the order to this location. The staff went above and beyond to get my order finished. It's was a wedding present for my best friend so having it turn out so amazing well was awesome. They resized it and made it look the best it could have been. If you have to use fedex office the trip to this store is well worth it.</text>

It took about 20 minutes to the employee to understand what I needed and then when I said that I needed a print out of the quote he replied that he could not give me a print out and so by refusing to give that printed quote they lost my business.
Update 06/21/2016
Return to the store for another try and I'm glad I did. This time I got assisted by Manuela and what difference. She understood my needs and within minutes I had a proof of my work to take with me. Today, as promised, the job ready for pickup with no issues what so ever. So if you need help with a project ask for Manuela.
I also want to add that the location of this office is really good near 280 freeway with other shopping stores and restaurants nearby a lot of space for parking. Today they deserve 4🌟< /Text>< Pics>

Never been treated so unprofessionally in my life. l went there with a print job  for programs for my father-in-law's funeral. I was quoted a price that was outrageous. I asked for a printout for the bid and was given a piece of receipt paper with the price on it written by hand in black magic marker. I went to another vendor a FEW doors away and they did the job for me at one-quarter the price I was quoted from FedEx. I was given a formal bid which was itemized and then they gave me 25%off on top of all that. You guys are losing to your competition. I used to work for you guys, another location and many years ago,  and I will never come to your store location again. The service was lousy at best and the store was empty, no customers,  and three people were working  behind the counter.</Text>

His supervisor actually had to step in and ask what the hell he was doing and that there was a line building up and people were already complaining. The package was about 3 feet away from him and clearly marked yet he still couldn't find it.

Just another FedEx location to get your package shipped or receive safely. Some of the employees there act like they're doing you a favor when helping you. This one employee Rjay right off the bat made me feel like he was doing me a favor for sending my package. He admitted to me that he was a new employee but he acted like he's been working there forever and hated it there. They should stick him in the back to do packaging instead of operate the front register. I gave it three stars because I will probably have to go back there since it's the closest location to me. But this place deserves two stars or less. #Poor judgement in employee placement...<//review>

<text>Terrible customer service!
It was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a print station at the Colma’s FedEx today.
I needed to print two simple pages that should have taken less than 5 min. Instead, it took over 40 minutes while waiting on a teller Diana, who not only ignored me despite my multiple quests, but talked to me in such a humiliating, dismissive way, that it was beyond any imagination. She was raising her voice in the most inappropriate way, as if it was not her job description to assist, and as if I have been asking for some kind of personal favor.  My experience at the FedEx was really far and beyond acceptable, practically abusive. Really unacceptable way to treat anyone!</text><Name>irina melnik</Name><Gmap_id>0x808f7bf4bdcacdf9:0xe26958169a8eb680< /Gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

< Review>
Avoid this place if possible. I went in to get a bunch of documents printed and bound. I came back 3 hours later to find they only printed and bound half of the document. Ended up having to come back another 4 hours later, which ultimately had me working on my shipment until after 1030pm. Ridiculous. Get it together Linda A!<//Review>

Wow, I've never seen such a lack of professionalism. My girlfriend and I came in on Halloween 2014.We were being helped for a while by a lady who ended up passing us along to the "expert" Reijew. Reijew was standoffish at best when he first began helping us and it only got worse as we tried to fix a relatively simple print job: a funeral program for my girlfriend's grandfather. After explaining the problem we were having he quickly told us that he could not do anything and that he NEEDED a different file or revision. No, "I'm sorry." No, "Unfortunately..." No customer service. He proceeded to try to fix it problem and found that he was running into the same problems and he finally started changing his tune when he was embarrassed he couldn't fix the problem.

Eventually, we pointed out that the printing was crooked, you could easily tell that the margins were thicker on the bottom than at the top. At this point he told us, "Well that's the best the machine can do. If you don't like it go to Office Depot." That was the last straw, and we stormed out and before I got in the car I stormed back in and took this A-hole's name down.

We went to Office Depot just a few doors down and they printed our programs with no problems. I'm so glad we took our business away from there and I hope this review takes even more away.

Reijew, I hope you get fired and maybe learn what customer service is before you get a new job.<//Text>

I normally ship Fedex from work, but I wanted to ask some questions in person.  The strip mall where this shop is located was mostly empty on a Saturday morning.  I walked up to the counter to speak to the attendant.  He didn't greet me, barely gave me any eye contact and didn't thank me, even after I thanked him at the end of the transaction.  I felt like I was in a USPS office.  I shipped my package, but I hope not to need to come here again.</Text>

Love this place. So many options from nostalgic candies to imported candies to bulk candies. Staff don old soda shop uniforms and assist with samples if you're interested. Customer loyalty program too.</text>

This place, and the people who run it, are absolutely amazing. From the moment you step in you are greeted by colors beyond compare all around you! And then you're greeted by a very sweet (no pun intended) smile on a very darling person who offers you a VERY DELICIOUS sample of something I may have gotten 3 bags of. Also try the prosecco cordials. You're welcome.<//Review>

< Review>
I love coming here all the time. They carry a diverse selection of sweets. They have imported candies from Europe, Asia, & Mexico so you have a lot to choose from. The employees are sweet people and really make your day. Definitely come here for a fun time and some treats to enjoy later as well!<//Review>

<date>1535132275819</date><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>FYI,  I GOT SICK On my last visit from eating a piece of white chocolate.
It took few days to feel better.
I filed a complaint with the store and
Went to LAPD Topanga Station per officer's suggestion I filed a complaint with the health department . After the health department inspection  on 8/14/2018 The store was written up for two violations # 43 & # 23. You can ask to see the report when you visit the store there required by law to show the report when asked.
Thank you< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>As stated in previous review, the powdered drinks ban only come in Chocolate and Vanilla.  Bought a roast beef sandwich and some chips.  The grocery clerks were friendly, cashier was too.  I went shopping  in the evening; the lady managing was rude.  Next time I think I'll have the deli clerk make a sandwich, the menu looks delicious.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Review>Why are sandwich 🥪 prices for exact same sandwich different at each store?  Disappointed with older lady who seems to run deli and treat staff and customers poorly.   As soon as she tried to serve me with dirty hands (not changing gloves to make sandwich after coming from back,  touching pants and adjusting mask /face)... I didn't want to return.<//Review><user_id>114767887342703526435</user_id><date>1616884575831< /date>< rate>

I shop here all the time. Great place but work morale definitely seems low. The staff are pretty openly rude to eachother in front of customers. There's also this one cashier who reminds me of Allison Janney who shouts a lot at other staff and customers and holy moley she stresses me the hell out. Other than that they got some rad stuff here.<//text>

<Text>Best time to go there is in the morning. The cashier's are friendly and they have Good customer service just don't asked the Manager. I asked one of the Managers what the passcode to the bathroom and he yell the code at me. This was at 7:05. I didn't hear him so I asked again and he still yelled the code. I'm Sorry but I just be nice and treat people with respect. Don't tell at me because you have a code to use your bathroom. He might be having a bad day but this was at 7am this morning. The cashier in front and bagger where really friendly. Just be nice and don't tell at your customers because they have questions.</Text>< date>

<text>Prices are always right here and I'm rarely disappointed. That said, last week I bought several items including a loaf of fresh bread that was supposedly fresh, and a bag of fresh cut Italian sausage. The bread started to mold in only 3 days, and the sausage was slimey within the week. That was disappointing.<//text>< pictures>

This is like the forever 21 of grocery stores, I don't know why I'm saying that but it just feels that way. I find myself loading more food in my cart than I plan but it's all healthy and fun - plus it makes me so happy!
Good fruit is always in abundance and on sale same with the veggie tables. Nice selection of snack bars, plenty of nuts in the bins to give yourself a lot of nuts. Hehe I'm funny. But seriously it's a must if you do healthy eats.< /text>

Great store, love this place (my favorite pandemic place to shop safely and expeditiously). My only criticism (which might take 1/2 of a star away), is the time it often takes waiting on a cashier line (especially since the pandemic).< /Text>

I understand the times demand we do our part to combat Covid19 and it appears there have been significant changes in that regard which I applaud.  But they seem to have lost some efficiency and quality where customer service is involved directly. Cashiers extremely slow. There’s a line of people standing out in the heat waiting to get in that would probably like not to have to wait as long as they are asked to. Employees working the floor seemed unknowledgeable about how to find products or just didn’t want to be bothered. The joy of shopping there seems to be gone<//Text>

<Review>Local Sprouts Features New Healthy Choices -- I stopped by during the 25% off health sale for nutrients I keep on hand, and my closest store offered samples of Bio-K+ hefty probiotic drink and Stryve Biltong Beef jerky/bacon alternative snacks. I tried both. I take simple capsule probiotics daily, so I noticed no digestive difference but I'd definitely opt for Bio-K+ next time I take flora-destroying antibiotics. Stryve offers smoked and original flavors of air-dried beef snacks. Both flavors are very good. I bought the original flavor pack at $4 introductory price. I probably won't buy often at $7 regular price. But I had a hard time stopping from eating this high protein quality beef snacking pack. Addictive!Original flavor is seasoned with vinegar and raisin juice plus spices, and once you start snacking you can save those flavors enhancing the beef. Delicious!</Review></record>

My favorite grocery in San Diego. The best produce in town at good prices, not premium prices.  Butchers are good, as is the meat and sea food, reasonably priced also. If you want health food at a competitive price there is no better in San Diego. They don't undress you like some other health food stores. Hint, hint Whole Foods.  My only gripe is I've seen athletic customers, in their 20's, with toy service dogs in the store lately. That is in every store in town now. Service dogs don't contaminate food or bother strangers. These animals do,</text>

Stopped here while on vacation to pick up a few snacks for our hotel room. We love the bulk food selection. We can get trail mix, nuts, and candy in whatever quantities we choose. Store was clean and well stocked.< /review>

<date>1538509757170<//date><Review>I bought one of their salads they make there. When I started eating it, I found a dead big BUG in it that I nearly ate. So I called them and they didn't even apologize. Just told me to come in to swap it out, almost like they're used to that happening.

On top of that, the salad tasted gross and was expensive. I don't know how you make salad taste bad. Even the meat on the salad (other than the bug) tasted really weird. ....and it didn't come with a fork like Vons salads.

Vons on Garnet has more variety, fresher food, and is cheaper for most meat & produce.

The only good thing about Sprouts is the many bins of nuts, grains, candy, etc. It's nice and unique.</Review>< user>

<text>Los empleados necesitan entrenamiento. Irrespetuosos.

To end our trip down the pacific coast we headed to Pacific Beach. We stopped in to grab fruit before going to watch the sunset. We took the opportunity to stop and use the restroom. There was an employee waiting in line also but was on her phone. We heard someone else call her Carol. Carol didn’t go into the restroom when someone got out so my friend went in. Then the next restroom became available and another friend held the door open for her. She snapped and very rudely said “ Come on! I know the code”. She got out and then it was my turn, she closed the door on us and we then asked the code. She gave it to me very rudely again and when I went it noticed that the toilet hadn’t been flushed. I took a picture in case corporate wants it. I don’t know if this was a racial issue or if this employee is like this normally but after such great service down the coast everywhere we went..it was disappointing to end our trip like this.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I do almost all my grocery shopping at Sprouts. I love this store for their high quality produce and meats and they always seem to have just what I need on sale (don't miss double discount days on Wednesday!). All natural snack options are great too!

I'm also a huge fan of their deli, where they've got the best deal on sandwiches in town. Unfortunately, the deli has taken a real downward turn lately though - first they eliminated the option for a combo with salad (chips is the only option now), then the change in staff... to put it simply, they're struggling back there. Please re-train the new staff.</Review>

I am visiting from Ohio. I was highly impressed with the Sprouts store, especially a lady (didn't get her name) in the supplement department. My husband was on the verge of going toUrgent Care. But with the suggestion of her, it was not necessary.  Everyone was so helpful anywhere. I just wish we had aSprouts near my home.<//Review>

I have a collection of photos of dirty little dogs riding in shopping baskets in this store.   I'm tired of going to a corporate chain health store just to see the manager blatantly disregard health code.

On top of that, after fighting for natural foods for over 20 years I don't like lazy, mindless employees who rest on the efforts of others.   I don't pay extra for lazy people's benefits.< /Text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Carolina I</user_name><Time>1494350852679<//Time><rate>5<//rate><review>**Edit- I've upped them from the 3 star meh rating back to an "I love it!" 5 star rating. I'm guessing they were just going through growing pains. Looks like they've got inventory and staffing figured out and it is once again my go to grocery store in the beach area.

I was really hoping that the newly remodeled Sprouts was going to be awesome. I've been shopping at this location back since it was still Henry's. Unfortunately, it kind of sucks now.
The produce selection- the main reason I go to Sprouts, was lacking. Poor quality and !worst thing!- the prices seem to have gone up.I guess the consumer is paying for the "improvements." Sprouts used to be my go to for fresh, well priced, and great variety of produce. No more.
They have a prepared foods deli now- sort of like Whole Foods, but with much poorer execution. And, I haven't once walked up to that counter and been helped right away, or told someone would help me soon, or even had some eye contact. I feel like I have to shoot a flare to get some attention at that deli counter.
Otherwise- the selection of dried goods, homeopathic health items, and a great parking situation for where it is located.
PB is in need of a decent grocery store. Gelson's is ridiculously overpriced for the quality. Parking at Trader Joe's and navigating the crowds there sucks. Vons is meh. Ralph's is okay. Sprouts has now managed to make itself worse. So- I renewed my Costco membership.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dc01ead61e4d97:0xca84c358025088ce<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Worship team AMAZING!   Atmosphere was filled with Gods presence.  Love the pastor so passionate.  First 2 times there people were so welcoming but last Sunday not so much. No one talk to us and we kinda felt invisible.  Hope it's better on weds bc we really like it there.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< user>

This is a great church with an amazing pastor. (There was co-pastor that did the message when I visited and he was great.) However, all of the kids from 6 and up were in the same kids group. No problem, but there was a boy who was not very nice to my 6-year old and he was in tears when I picked him up. I guess none of the staff noticed because it was such a big group.</Text>

<Review>3 services to choose from. Diverse community of believers. The anointed undiluted word of God is preached. Messages are relatable and relevant. Praise and worship ushers the presence of God and the prayer team is anointed. Child care is available and lots of parking. RLC loves, leads and looks like heaven.</Review><Resp>None< /Resp><date>1558224510868</date><rating>5</rating><Gmap_id>0x809ad63a835e5e4b:0xef193e3265c16116< /Gmap_id>< name>

It feels healthy and loving and the people are joyful and warm. I sense God's presence every service. Pastor Dean's preaching and teaching is very life applicable and sound according to the Word of God and I always feel encouraged by it. Real Life Church has done a great job in creating programs for all age groups. Programs that are interactive, fun and christ-centered. I'm very thankful to the Lord that he led me to this church!< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

6 years ago I hit rock bottom. My friend Molly brought me to RLC. This changed my life. I went from living in a shelter with my kids to buying a home 4 months ago. God is good and he has chosen Pastor Scott and Karen to lead many to him. I am truly blessed to be a part of RLC.</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I booked their appointment on Friday 8th for 12:15 pm with their corporate office.  Appointment was double confirmed on text messages also. All set. Then just 20 mins before the appointment, when I was on my way to appointment, their Tracy office called and said that they cant honor the appointment. Then it was rescheduled to Wednesday 13th at 3:00 pm. Again this appointment was double confirmed via text messages. All set again. When I went for appointment, their office told me that my appointment is not in their list. 1st shocker. But they can still take me in within 45 minutes. After I waited for 90 minutes, they mentioned that it will take another 1 hour or they can reschedule. By this time, I lost any trust in their system. I told them to cancel the whole thing and came back.<//Text>< pics>

It has been a pleasant experience for me to get my dental work done at this clinic. Doctor and staff are very caring and professional. Dr. Bhawna provided a painless and very effective treatment at the blink of eye. She answered all my question regarding the treatment plan. I will highly recommend this clinic for anyone.<//review>

I  went into the office today scared and very unexpected of getting anything done, I was honestly amazed at how caring, compassionate, professional and wonderful Will and his team was. I have some very complicated issues going on and Will and his team met all my needs, helped me figure out a treatment plan that I was able to afford, and never made me feel embarrassed or  insecure. They are going to help me smile again, it;s like someone gave me back my life. :) Thank you so much, I will never be able to express my appreciation.<//Text>

I was nervous to come into this office, I've heard a lot of bad things about Western Dental recently. My own last visit to the other office in town wasn't so great either. Thankfully, the entire staff at this office were very welcoming. I felt no judgment walking into the office. I got in quickly, they were very thorough with their x-rays and even took pictures on my teeth, which is something i've never seen before. William came in the exam room to talk to me about my options and went above and beyond to work with my payment limit. He was really comfortable to talk to which is nice, the last dentist i went to seemed very judgmental and was in and out of the exam room in two minutes. Thank you all so much for the time you spent helping me understand and giving me all the options you could find,  i really appreciate it. I'll be back soon for sure.<//Text>

This was the best experience I have ever had with a Dentist or any Doctor in California !!! I will recommend to anybody I know, including my family. If I had to pay cash I wouldn't even mind. The level of professionalism, The care, The nurture and respect that is so openly given to patients.  Dr. Angela (My Favorite Doctor), Vanessa (The Veteran Assistant) , and Desiree (The Kindest Receptionist) are the best I have encountered. I do not say things like this - But I Trust them,  100% . Especially the ones I just mentioned above. They constantly communicate with each other to make sure you are taken care of and from Dr. to Assistant - From the highest position to the lowest position; everyone is involved with the betterment of the patient and you can just tell from the atmosphere that they really just do care about you. My personal and honest opinion. Come check it out. and Yeah, I am So happy I came here  :)</text><response>None<//response></record>

This office had the audacity to try and charge me $91 for topical application of fluoride and tell me that my insurance does not cover it.  My insurance said otherwise.  I did not appreciate being lied to so they could make an extra buck.  I wonder how many others have been lied to in regards to what their insurance covers and have been scammed by these people?? I will report them to my insurance carrier!!!<//Review>

I've been to this office about 3-4 times now and have had nothing but good experiences. The staff has been very nice, as well as the hygienist and dentist. I was surprised that they took me back so quickly at my first visit, and then again in subsequent visits. I always request an appointment first thing in the morning or right after lunch so I'm sure that helps, but even so some offices take a while. I work in the medical field so I understand how offices can get backed up but I haven't witnessed that at Coast.< /review>

<text>Wheewww such a relief. Coast dental was a breeze of fresh air. The staff was fast and great. The dentist was perfect. I felt well taken care of. I was in and out with barely no wait time. Compared to western dental, with long waits, bad service, rude staff....Coast dental in Tracy really knows how to run a business and I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Do not go anywhere else especially western dental, you’ll be sorry.</text></record></dataset><record>

First of all. Good luck to anyone with a referral to this place. I spent over a month calling my dentist and Coast Dental just to coordinate the referral. I finally had to go there in person to drop off the paperwork for the referral. They tried to tell me that I didn't have the right kind of paperwork for a referral to get a simple evaluation for sedation dentistry done. The lady in the front office was incredibly rude. I've never been treated with such disrespect from someone who's job is to be nice to clients. I wouldn't go back if at all possible< /text>

<Text>Missed an appointment where they were going to TALK about my wisdom teeth.
$100 of my Christmas money goes to Coast Dental. But I guess it's fair.

Though, I must say that despite all of the other issues, I really didn't run into any. Yes, some people
felt robotic and didn't have the greatest vibe but my actual dentist was very polite. I tend to ask many questions when a person of much higher knowledge of the subject seems friendly enough. He answered all of my questions accordingly and I can honestly say I left the office satisfied.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I usually don't go out of my way to write reviews, despite how positive or negative. I went there because it was one of the only places other than Western Dental that was covered by my insurance.

When I first called to make my appointment I was initially impressed by how friendly the receptionist sounded. Going into the office was completely different.

I came in a few minutes before my appointment. The receptionist was engaged in conversation with another staff member and they were talking and laughing, while I was waiting. It wasn't until 10 minutes that I had arrived that they finally came to the front and noticed that I was there.  I thought it highly unprofessional, they should be aware of when their patients are coming in and not keep them waiting unnecessarily. It took about 30-40 minutes to actually see the dentist.

When the dental assistant called for me, she didn't give me a hello, the only reason I noticed I was next was because I looked up and noticed she had the door open. She examined me without a word and I finally managed to squeeze an awkward "Hello" for politeness' sake. I felt a high hostility. The first thing she asked me to do was to sign some form. Instead of asking me how I was or something of the sort, she said, "Sign here." It was some document acknowledging my method of payment and what I was being charged.  Of course I can read, but somehow you would figure people who are providing a service would be more polite than that.

Once we got to the X-ray room, she proceeded to place the X-ray protective apron on me and meanwhile she asked me my age. I felt the question a bit out of place. It wasn't like she had had much interest in me earlier, why would my age matter now anyway. I understand it might be a protocol procedure, but it's not so much what she asked as how she asked it. There's a way to be polite. All of our interactions seemed robotic, even forced. The dental assistant did not look happy doing her job and I was not very happy in her presence either. Very negative and unpleasant worker and vibe she gave off.

When the X-rays were finished, I then met the actual dentist. She was the only pleasant employee. She was polite, knowledgeable and when I asked her questions she tried to answer my questions.

After my meeting with the dentist and after she suggested my treatment plan, I saw the hygienist who took a look at my gums. I have never felt such pain in a dental visit, EVER. She poked my gums so hard that they bled. They bled for about 3 hours after I left the office.

Needless to say, I don't intend on going back. I wouldn't recommend this place. If you can, look into getting a dentist that has good reviews. I hope this spares someone a negative visit to this place.</Review>

I'd give 0 stars if I could, but unfortunately I can only give one as a minimum. I had two choices in dentists due to my insurance, and unfortunately we picked Coast. My first clue about the service I was about to receive was when I told someone where I was going for my appointment she winced.

My daughter and I made 3:00 appointments so that we would be out in time to grab my other daughter from daycare. I arrived about 10 minutes early so I could begin filling out paperwork. The staff at the desk were neither friendly nor rude. After about 10 minutes I was called up and given my paperwork (in hind sight I should have requested the paperwork ahead of time as that is how my previous dentists have operated to be more efficient).

By 3:55 the waiting room was so full that people were sitting on the floor. I walked up and let them know I had been waiting close to an hour and needed to leave by 5 to get my other daughter. They told me they would bring me right back. I got up from my chair and waited 10 more minutes to grab the staff's attention to ask again when I would be seen. At 4:20 we were finally let back. I had to call my husband so he could leave work early and grab out other daughter. The hygienist was apologetic and took my daughter's x-rays. She sat us in an examine chair and by 4:50 the dentist was there. He was very professional and apologetic as well.

Finally at 5:30 I was finally taken in for my xrays. The dentist came in, and since I need a filling they offered to just do my cleaning when I come back. At that point I felt so defeated I just agreed and paid for our visits and left.

Needless to say, I WILL NOT be going back to Coast Dental. I will wait to get my fillings until open enrollment and choose another insurance plan that allows me to visit other dentists beginning in January, or gladly pay full price out of pocket to avoid this place.< /review>

In my opinion, I was seen as more of a dollar sign.  I still have some of my wisdom teeth.  The first thing that was said: Oh, we'll just PULL them out.  I know dentists get paid per tooth.. and it's such an insensitive thing to say.  The last time I got my wisdom teeth pulled (from another dental practice), a saw had to be used.  I was emotionally scarred from the experience, so I did not want to hear that.

And I'm always hearing a sales pitch.  One of the hygienists recommended some fluoride treatment.  She told me about it and asked if I wanted to do it.  Luckily I asked her how much, because she told me it was going to be about $60.  I told her to check my insurance, which I knew they wouldn't pay for.  If I had said yes, I would've been billed!

And they kept pushing one of their electric toothbrushes on display.  It's equivalent to a doctor prescribing medication and you finding the drug's name/logo all around the office.  I deserve to be treated better than that.</text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>This review is for the Orthodontist Team. My  experience with Dr  Bailey has been phenomenal over the years. If you are looking to get that perfect smile via Ortho, Dr. Bailey is the MAN to get you there !! I have dealt with him for many years, he is knowledgeable and always willing to do what it takes to get you a beautiful smile that will be talked about for years to come. He has extensive experience that is unmatched by many orthodontist out there.I could name several bad experiences  at other locations/practices but I don't think it is appropriate for this review. Please remember that as a patient work is required on your end too, keeping appointments, cleansing properly , follow recommendations...etc. Nothing worth having comes without effort.   I also can not write this review without mentioning Elizabeth, she is always helpful and willing to do what she can to accommodate me on the schedule. She even worked on getting my files transferred from another location, so that I would not have to carry the burden. I am willing to travel from Fresno to Tracy because I know this team will take great care of me. Dr Bailey and Elizabeth are worth the time and money!!! #lovethisteam< /Text>< Pictures>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Coast Dental is the worst thing to ever happen to me. SAVE YOUR SANITY & MONEY from these money hungry crooks!! The orthodontist supervisor at the front desk is the WORST person to deal with. I’ve never done anything wrong to her I always try to smile and be nice meanwhile she’s always mean and stuck up and giving  me attitude for no reason, doesn’t call when she says she will, lies about leaving messages and after reviewing some of the other reviews apparently I’m not the only one who feels  this way about her.
I am a good patient, my braces are paid off, I always pay any fees on the spot when presented to me, and I’m currently in the process of trying to purchase my first home and these people don’t even have the brain cells to tell me there was an issue with my insurance, apparently it was never updated in the system so I got stuck with a bill from collections in the same month of the appointment I was being billed for??? HOW does something go to collections if you were never told about any balances in the first place, let alone in the same month?? No paper statement, no verbal statement, no call, no receipt & definitely no voicemails were left on my phone.  When I went in for my next checkup I presented the statements I received from collections in the mail and gave them my new insurance card AGAIN and Liz at the front desk tried to justify the situation with “ oh but I left you a voicemail”…EXCUSE ME??  I very calmly told her I never got any voicemail from you and she just shrugged it off and repeated herself like that was ok. Then proceeded to tell me oh it’s almost closing time I’m not taking care of this now. I’ll do it later, and I wasn’t comfortable with that at all. I was afraid she would just say “I left you a message” again.  After I never received a call as expected, I went in several times & called the office several times & every time I get the same answer, no notes are left on my file about what we discussed and she’s not here right now but they will have her call me and nothing ever happens, no one ever calls me, I’m constantly answering weird numbers that call me hoping its them but it never is. TODAY collections called me trying to collect and I was LIVID.  So now I’m here writing this review and I will be reporting them to the ADA Association. I left voicemails with corporate also.  SO if you’re reading this ELIZABETH it would be nice if you finally called me back as promised with a resolution.  & no you did not leave me a voicemail.
bottom line: Do not come here, they will screw over your credit score for sure and stiff you with the bill.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Our family needed some orhto work and after doing lots of research we decided on coast dental in tracy and it has been a good experience -
The staff is all very kind and attentive as well very accommodating - we actually have enjoyed our visits and would recommend them to others -
"D", Liz and of course Dr. B are all super!

<Text>Horrible service and horrible prices. Always had to wait at least an hour, if not more, before they got to you, even if it was for just a check up. We just switched to a new dentist place and I have no cavities while at Smile Care, it seemed like I would never stop having them. My mom was told that her gums are infected because she started bleeding during a cleanse, but they were actually pushing so hard that they hurt her and she started bleeding. Also discovered that my relative has a missing tooth that isn't a baby tooth so we are going to check records and see if Smile Care was responsible for that. To add on, they overcharge you to the max and will never give you the option to do procedures one at a time to help you out financially.< /Text>< Pics>

The worst dentist office I ever been, my 3 kids had appointment at different days and even they had scheduled it tooks about 2 hours to be seen.  The doctor was really nice but they don't use hygienic plastic covers on any of the electrical hand pieces and the worst part was the stuff they are rude and do not care to keep their patients for this office.</text>

I use to go there and thought I may go to another place but I learned my lesson and came back where I belong! It is a great place very friendly and are like a family. If you need any dental work done this is the place to go!

(Translated by Google) Good job here. They did a deep cleaning and a white filling too. They have one called Naida that explained everything to me in Spanish. Now my teeth look whiter. Thank you all.

No one answers their phones. I've been calling for several days, I also emailed them with no response. (I also called the embassy with no response). I don't understand if the office is unoccupied, or they're too busy drinking their ahweh. If you have an emergency, you wouldn't be able to rely on them for help.

And all the good reviews are probably written by the staff themselves. If you notice, they're all either 1 star reviews or 5 stars. Too bad you can't bribe them. Maybe that might help you get through, like other Lebanese government officials.< /text>

I have been calling for the past 2 weeks to have an appointment for power of attorney.
Staffs at the consulate don’t answer the phone ,and you can’t leave a message because it is full and they don’t reply on emails.
Last things if I can give the staffs 1/4 of a star I would .
Worthless and unprofessional<//Review>

It seems that the Lebanese culture of poor service is still prevalent at this place. I have been calling them for the past two weeks during business hours, trying different extensions, leaving voicemail with no answer. I sent four emails asking for help, no answer either. They don't seem to realize that they are there to render a service...<//review>

I arrived 30 min before closing and they were already closed. I tried to call and a rude operator answered sorry we are already closed. As usual they get paid for doing nothing and not abide by the rules. If they want to leave early because they are bored just let them change the hours.< /Review>

Keep your receipt.  CA law requires they can't pay you the same day for recycled aluminum and copper.  They said they would mail a check in a few days.  Called 3 weeks later about "no check" and told "sitting here for pickup, but we can mail it".  Yes, please.  I suspect recyclers are exploiting the state law using fake "oops", as I don't remember ever getting a similar check from Schnitzer ~6 yrs ago (forgot to follow up).  Otherwise, Sims was quick on weighing and unloading.</text>

This is NOT a rating of thos establishment. This IS a rating of Google Maps Categories there needs to be a differentiation between CRV Recycling Centers and Other Recycling Centers.

I and others have spent far too much time and resources trying to recycle CRV bottles and cans to discover that not ALL Recycling Centers take them.

I'm going to further assume that certain materials are not accepted at all recycling facilities. For example, electronic waste may not be accepted at 1 recycling center while at another that is all they recycle.

And of course there are hazardous materials recycling centers for the disposal of used motor oil, household cleaners, other household chemicals, paint, and other materials. And centers for industrial recycling.

Each of these needs their own separate category or some kind of designation to differentiate each type so that we can easily identify which one we want to go to, instead of having to call all around or in many cases because they don't answer or have a phone, and we have to drive there only find out they are closed, they don't take this or that, and other issues.

Again this should NOT reflect on this company's ratings. There was no other tool I could find available to bring this issue to light.

Thank you.

After some time I will actually visit this business and give them a proper rating. I apologize in advance and hope that their assistance in resolving this will result in the goodwill of others and offset any detraction this temporary and unfairly low ratings brings.<//text>

Ive been to both rancho and the Sacramento yard and I must say the staff at the Sacramento yard are so helpful and amazing. I was able to get in and out of the yard easily with help from all employees. The ladies in the office are so friendly and kind. I even left with a hot cup of coffee on a cold windy day. Amazing customer service!!! I definitely will be coming back to the Sacramento yard.</text>

We've been selling our scrap to Sims Metal for the past 5 or so years and we've always been treated with respect and professionalism. The girls in the office are very friendly and even care enough to make sure customers stay hydrated with ice cold bottles of water on hot days. The selling process is simple and iv'e never had any problems getting paid. Good job Sims! Thumbs up from Toledo Towing👊<//Review>

Awesome company. They deal with the community on a large scale. They give the best pricing I've seen in awhile. Service is slow, but they are dealing with a large scale of clientel. Armadas of trucks.</Review>

Best prices around, honest and accurate. I have been to several metal places and I always have to watch and make sure that other places give me the right prices for my scrap, most of the time they are lazy and put the clean copper with dirty and give you the cheaper price. At sims it was diffrent, Rod was his name he was excellent. He explained every step along the way, after he weighed each diffrent type of metal he showed me the weight on the scale to make sure I understood how much weight each type of metal was. All the weight was correct and I got the right price for each type of metal. Sims went above and beyond like I say he explained everything along the way so there was no confusion and I got top dollar. One of the things I had was priced at 1.05 per pound. The 2 scrap places on elkhorn located right next to eachother I wont mention there names but one offered me .65 cents the other offered me .70 cents and they claim they have the best prices I call b.s. Sims beat there price by far. If you have anything to scrap or if your unsure what type or grade of metal go to Sims they will give you top dollar or tell you what to do to get top dollar. I wish more businesses were honest like Sims I will definitely be back.< /text>

Keep in mind I'm not a drug addict, just needed to get rid of some metal and didn't need the money right away. They gave me a price $0.03 higher than any other place in the Sacramento area. Then when I got there, they were extremely polite and helpful. However, I was quoted $0.41/# over the phone but they only paid $0.40 and I didn't notice. They got a five-star rating because they could've just let it go, but they took it upon themselves to correct the mistake and paid me the quoted price with an explanation when I received the check. I probably wouldn't have done the same. The drive from Yuba City is well worth the treatment and apparent honesty they provided me. Thank you Sims, I will be back.<//review>

<Review>Terrible first impression. Wasted $5 in gas waiting for my turn on scale behind huge construction bins and trailers. Rude workers all around me. I did not feel important or that my business was wanted. Had a mixed heavy iron and steel load and was expected to weigh out multiple times to get the right price which would have taken a hour. Figured I'd try them cuz they have a big mountain of metal. First try was terrible. Not impressed.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<text>I went here around 12:00 pm on a Saturday to recycle aluminum cans. I had 22.3 pounds and received only $35.50. They pay the state bare minimum of $1.59 per pound. When I had a car, I could take my cans somewhere that will pay almost $2.00 per pound, so I was short around $12. This place is located in an area that is predominately populated by homeless people who also do not have a car to go anywhere else. I was thinking there is obviously a purpose for that. The service was slow, the employees were rude and short with me.

All in all, if you have a car and have aluminum CRV, go somewhere else. The people who need the money for recycling the most, get the state bare minimum to survive. I do not want to support a business that seems to hate the poor and homeless and neither should you. This pathetic place prays on the poor to make a profit.</text>< pictures>

Only by appointments. Probably the only barber living in fear. Wanted to try it out but i need a place that will accept a walk ins. Check out other barbers in the area. Called three and they all accept walk ins.<//review>

<Review>This place is the bees knees!! All of the barbers were pretty cool guys! (And gal!)  Their back and forth banter kept me entertained the whole time!     I wish I caught the gentleman’s name who cut my sons hair (my bad bro!) He did so great with my son who wasn’t really in the mood for a haircut and brought him around with his great attitude!! And Paul cut my boyfriends hair and did amazing as well!! You can tell they take pride in their work!! We will definitely be back!!<//Review>< pictures>

The Gentlemens Parlor Shop is an awesome place to go get your hair cut. Danny, Kate, Angel and Paul are all excellent barbers with really good personalities. They all make you feel like you're family, as you take a walk back down memory lane with the classic oldie tunes playing and cool antique memorabilia. I take my little guy there and myself and we both come out looking great. Sometimes there can be a wait, but they're worth it. Just grab a cold soda (which they sell for $2 and they come in glass bottles) and enjoy rockin' out to the oldies until it's your turn.<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>This is a classic old school barber shop. The walls are covered with guy friendly antique Americana and cold soda in glass bottles can be purchased from the cooler, if you like.  The haircuts provided are always five star.  My three sons love getting their hair cut here and each has their favorite barber cut their hair.  Full disclosure: I am a  bald guy and my wife cuts my bit of hair, but my kids have full thick hair from momma's side of the family and love going to The Gentleman's Parlour.  Danny, the proprietor, is always friendly and keeps a very clean shop.  It's Cash Only and worth every, very reasonably priced, penny! My family have been clients for over seven years and have never been disappointed.</Review>< Pictures>

Excellent service. I take my brother and my dad here all the time. It's much more than a haircut, it's an experience. The staff is friendly and are more than happy to provide a haircut and a shave. I highly recommend.
I forgot to mention that this barber shop has incredible decor. It has a manly feel to it. There are vintage pieces all over the shop like old Coca-Cola bottles and barber shop signs, along with plenty of magazines to look through. The staff is friendly and social. They're also great with young children and elderly men.< /Review>

They only take cash and their ATM didn't work for me. Also they are always full, which I think speaks good of them tho. Aside from that their service is excellent. I've gotten cut by everyone there and they all performed excellent. My favorite is Fred but I would take any of them. They offer shaves and other things but a regular haircut is $15.< /Text>

Besides a great hair cut every time you're greeted by name , always feel welcome. Danny runs a clean and tidy place and all his employees have great attitudes. Very fun place.</review>

Great atmosphere. Friendly barbers. Reasonable prices. Excellent service. What else can you ask for? This is a real old school barber shop. I'll definitely be going back again.< /Review>

Waste of time but only go here if you want expensive haircuts long waits and a 1930s slick back ugly haircut👎👎 lazy people and messy.< /Text>< response>

My dad and I have made it a tradition to come here together to get haircuts. now my son and I come in together. It's fun to listen to the different kinds of classic rock and country music. The decor is really cool. It's like taking a step back in time. As long as I live in the valley, I'll never go anywhere else.</text>

The only reason I didn't choose five stars is because I waited over an hour to get my cut. That being said everything else was absolutely amazing. I'm from a place that no one takes pride in anything they do and people act like you are more of a burden than anything. Not this place.  True barbers are artists and this place is the real deal .< /review></record>

<text>My fiance refuses to go anywhere but here, and to anyone but Fred. I love seeing him come home looking suave and professional, and the hot towel shaves make him feel like a new man. The price is great, but of course we always tip well, as the service he gets is always worth so much more. :D< /text></record>

Ive been here a few times and always disappointed with a jacked up dew that i have to fix when i get home.Seen the white guy in the last seat everytime. He cuts your hair how he wants, not how you want. I most deffinetly wouldnt trust him to trim my beard. He asked i said NOPE. I will Never go back.<//Text>

Excellant "ear lowering"(barbershop)in the San Jacinto Valley...great owner/stylist and attentive barbers...Fun place to chat/relax,and get a superb haircut all at the same time.GREAT following for the Owner and his staff...might have to wait awhile to be in a chair....but very much worth it...no returning in a week to get a re-trim...cut the way you tell/want it. They also have soft drinks that can be purchased and drank while waiting your turn; also Danny sells t-shirts and baseball caps with his logo...buy a few, I have.</text>

Barber Danny usually transmits positive vibes, but his demeanor today was rather rude. However the haircut was good, I did have leftover hairs by the neckline which I had to shave at home, but otherwise good haircut. I will not be coming back though.< /Text>

The guys here are great at giving me the haircut that I want.  They have a welcoming, laid-back style, which I enjoy.  My barber was very good at listening to how I wanted my hair styled.  Definitely the place I would go to if I was in Hemet, and in need of a haircut.< /Review>

I won't go anywhere else.....it takes me back to the old school barber shop's! They are professional, and make you feel comfortable...and you're getting the best care in the area! Stop in, and I bet you'll never go anywhere else for good old fashion men's grooming, and the latest men's haircuts!<//text>

<review>My goodness! of all the places I've been to in Hemet and San Jacinto, THIS is the best! i literally came in and asked "just make me look good, my good man" then he gave me a Gentlemen's cut that was so on point I literally went to the SJ Walmart just to show off my new cut. This is a REAL barber shop. not a salon.  to all guys, dudes, swaggets, Gentlemen, Mr, bros, boys, and everything else around... I recommend this place.  so worth the 13$ (:<//review>< UserId.>

You need an appointment to get in there and the days that are available we're not convenient. You had to know the person's name that you wanted how to cut your hair. Since I didn't know any of the names they hung up and acted like they didn't care. That day I went somewhere else in Hemet to get my haircut with no appointment and they were very friendly, as well as eager for my business. Gentlemen's parlor... Your history<//text>

<text>Super professional & clean. Chris has such amazing precision to detail! Went in already expecting to be satisfied & happy with the tattoo, but I ended up being surprised with how much more little intricate detail was added in the right spots to emphasize it all the better! Loved it & his work so much! Deffffffffff will ALWAYS be going back for more!</text><name>Michelle Reza<//name><time>1616365818552</time><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

I had a great experience at American Vintage Tattoo. Chris took the time to listen to my ideas and created a one-of-a-kind, hand drawn traditional style tattoo for me. The shop is clean and well run. It was a 5 star experience without a doubt!<//Review>

<Review>I received a quick response to my email and got an appointment. Chris was on time and very welcoming. We discussed my my artwork and he drew it up. The shop is very clean and they follow infection control practices  Excellent fine line work. I would definitely recommend this shop.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>I called to ask about getting a piercing and the person I spoke with was rude. "Im looking to get my septum pierced, are you guys currently taking clients and do you have restrictions for piercings that go under your mask?" he spoke to me in a condescending tone and said "I don't know what you mean by that and I am not the piercer, just come in thursday through Saturday" I didnt think it was professional or welcoming.<//text>< GmapID>

Really good stuff. They're in the process of remodeling the place, as they took it over from someone else, so it's not pristine looking, but it looks like it will be when they are finished. Got amazing work from spider, and saw Chris do an amazing traditional leg piece. So nice, so professional,  my new favorite place.</Review>

The owner of American Vintage Tattoo- Chris has done pretty much my whole sleeve. Every tattoo that he does has been his own design that he has drawn himself. He also tattoos several of my other friends and they love his work as well. The shop is very clean and staffs several other talented artists. He uses high quality ink and machines which makes such a difference in the outcome of how the tattoo looks and heals. Chris is very professional and a great artist and it’s shown in every piece he does. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to get tattooed. They also have a piercer on staff who’s also very reputable and great.< /text>

Hope we see you again!'}<//Resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>117385563310923455552<//UserId.><Text>An awesome experience! Chris was so incredibly helpful...this was my first tattoo and I was very nervous, but he was so kind that he put me right at ease! The experience in the shop was so chill, but the best part of the experience was the finished result!! I am just obsessed with my tattoo...the talent and expertise is so clear when you look at it. I got a little Pooh Bear by my ankle and i love him- The lines are so clean (somehow both thin enough to look dainty and dark enough to be clear!!), and the little details of his face are still there despite how small it is!! I cannot express enough how wonderful this entire experience has been, or recommend this shop (specifically, Chris de Armas) enough!!</Text><Date>1582228900147<//Date><gmap_id>0x80dcd744f71bdf77:0x124e52af1ce1f2c4< /gmap_id>< rating>

Best tattoo shop experience I've ever had. The owner, Chris de Armas, was over the top polite, knowledgeable, made great suggestions, and couldn't have made me feel more comfortable with the whole experience. I'm not sure if I can go to any other shop after this over-the-top experience. Hats off to Chris and his amazingly warm and friendly team!<//review>

My wife tattoo isnt traditional and he still knocked it out of the park. My in-law saw our work and she wants to go with us next time to get worked on too. Extremely please with his work. They even hooked us up with dinner basically. Going back soon to put a deposit in for this upcoming saturday.< /text>< Time>

Last time I came about three weeks ago I ordered on phone so when I got there should of been pretty much ready. I waited another 20 minutes and that's only because I looked on their table and looked at the names on the bags, even though I was sitting there waiting no one called it out or asked me. This time I was left on hold and actually arrived at restaurant before they picked up (15 min). Maybe its the youngsters working their, they don't care it seems. Because when I mentioned it was like "ok" no apology of course.  They get one more shot from me and then its on to the next great restaurant 😊<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c3552e46115015:0xcfb0abf8529e83dc</gmap_id></record>

<review>Great tacos, definitely stop by if you are in the area. I had the Pastor (seasoned pork), asada (steak), and Birria (beef in broth). They were all great tasting. 4 stars only because due to the avocado shortage I didn't get avocado salsa which would have made the asada tacos taste even better. Green salsa is the best, not spicy great roasted flavors. Red salsa is also great tasting more of a tomatoee flavor but the spicy creeps up on you. I will be back</review>< pics>

I've been going here for 2 years now. Tuesday 6/8 I went to pick up my families order. Carne asada torta, 2 carne asada burritos and a quesadilla. All of us who ate carne asada got food poisoning, confirmed by doctor. Horrible diarrhea. I am pregnant, the diarrhea dehydrated me causing me to be in the hospital with contractions. Idk if they gave us old meat, meat from the night before they might have left out. Regardless we all got sick. Yes yes cook at home blah blah blah. That's why restaurants exist. No consumers, no business. I hope they really take care of the quality of the food they are selling because  mean it wasn't free. Thankfully we are all better now. But it was no joke being hooked up to an IV for hours with contractions and not being able to even drink water without the pain and throwing up.<//text>

my first time dining at this restaurant and this is what I found.

1. Walked into a very clean and Quaint restaurant.

2. The three ladies at the counter we're very pleasant, informative and engaging. Evelyn, Isabel and Melissa.

3. the food was prepared quickly and with care.

4. We had both Tortas and tacos all of which were bursting with flavor. We enjoyed every bite.

My hats off to the cooks in the kitchen and the establishment overall. We will definitely be back to dine again soon.< /review>

<Review>I love to get their quessa Beria tacos with consommé which are good depending on the cook. But I like to call it in to avoid waiting in the parking lot for the food to be ready, but their always putting me on a “brief” hold and I’m holding for over 5 minutes or they never answer, when I do go in to order after getting no where over the phone theirs never hardly any customers inside the restaurant (except Tuesday’s) and I end up waiting anyways. Sometimes I even change my food preference to something else because it pisses me off to see such poor service. Sad cause the girls are nice just slow moving.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

I also had their Diablo torta and omg, you guys have to try it. For those spicy chile lovers, I will advise you have a large glass of water, because it is smokin' spicy, but delicious.</review>< rating>

The food is good, I had an unpleasant experience that when buying carne asada fries I found 2 long hairs between the food. a recommendation for the owner is that all employees should wear hair nets.
Also cashiers are very rude and unprofessional when placing a order</Text>

< review>
It was our first time here. My family and I were starving!!! We bought the birria, not the best tasting. I picked up my order and asked the server if all the condiments were inside like salsas, chiles, onion and cilantro. Well, to my surprise, they weren’t in the bag. I ended up rinsing the birria meat and redo it myself. We diced up onion and chopped up some cilantro. The torta cubana was not our fave either. We voted that the only good idea was the horchata. The strawberry lemonade tasted like spoiled lemons. Yuck.</review>

The associate was friendly and very helpful , the other associates were , let’s just say too busy on their phones . As far as the food , the meat was over cooked . The guacamole was more like an avocado salsa . It’s safe to say I gave this place a shot , but would not ever return ! And definitely have told my friends and family to avoid this place .<//text>< Pics>

<review>Awesome place. Quick bite, taco shop vibe but with a nice casual dining area that surprised me. Looked very comfortable and peaceful. Had fresh
Natural water melon water that was delicious. Do yourself a solid go eat here. Fried Icream was my desert. I will be taking my whole family soon.

Another great Taco spot found! They have handmade tortillas! Hard to find in most places. So far we have tried all teir tacos and the birria tacos are our favorite!!! The tortas are also a must have.
Oh don't forget the freah agua frescas!!!<//review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>I’ve been to this place a couple of times, it was recommended by one of my friends. The food is always good, and restaurant is super clean. Lately I’ve been ordering on the phone more than dining in, I can say the service is better at the restaurant than when they take orders to go. I say this because last few times I called to place an order I felt rushed and wasn’t even told what was the estimated time for me to pick it up. Maybe something they would want to change? Anyways, 4 stars for bomb food -1 costumer service.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Their fried chicharrones are also so good omg with the red sauce.  They are freshly made and still crackling when they are brought to your table. The asada tacos are to die for, with their guacamole, and the tortillas are homemade.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmPdE-ncgjDNwtBfaaZsSyV2dFhXQOSIUoR2Q-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCmE5Ltz1za3f3tRYUDwbDkE6MqCDwYGI-0qft=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPangakHwuySi4Z3jhG1qqA4n-Wr46NBHEqAirr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c3552e46115015:0xcfb0abf8529e83dc<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>First time here, but my goodness this is great. I got 30 tacos for taco Tuesday and they did not disappoint. Got the Carne Asada, Chicken and Pastor. All three are moist and just perfect. I recommend the green sauce but the red works just as well. Will be coming back for more.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIEP0b644GYOFbt_aTCMidCfKn5vIbCE9ECo0M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c3552e46115015:0xcfb0abf8529e83dc< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This place messed up my order, I showed them the receipt when I picked up and they still didn't fix it. Their Al pastor tacos are adobado not true al pastor. The pork was full of fat and smelled bad. Haven't tried their tortas but people might want to stick to those.</Text>

This place is a local favorite. 5 stars on Yelp. Everything here is very flavorful. I especially like the Cali burrito, it is to die for! and is big enough if your not to hungry that you can share it or save half for later. My wife and I will share one with some chips and salsa along with a plate of grilled onions and chillies...The slopes, bomb, the tortas, bomb..trust me you won't be disappointed. Taco tues;) feed the family at a great price...</Text>

I haven't tried all their food did eat there Tortas they make them like paninis which makes it seem weird because I'm used to having fluffy bread not smashed and toasted just gives it a weird texture. They do have lengua burritos which are my favorite and they do a good job with them nice flavor would recommended it for something quick and easy</Text>

I have been on a quest for the perfect Carne Asada burrito for the last 5 years, ever since I moved away from the restaurant who I'm still convinced serves the best in the world. Now living in SoCal, you'd think this quest would be easy. Not so. I've had many sub-par burritos in the last 5 years. Only street tacos in Mexico have come close.

This burrito though, was easily a 9/10. It was absolutely delicious, carne asada was flavorful and tender as it should be. The only thing I would change is to add more beef! Not that they're stingy, it's a good ratio. The meat is just so good, I wanted more.

I just ordered this and received it from Postmates 20 minutes ago. After devouring the burrito, I knew I had to leave this place a review. Excellent quality 👍</Review>

Great Mexican food near home. Great quantity and quality for the price. Hot sauces at the table. Meat is tasty, tortillas are fresh, hot sauce are great, roomy with plenty of tables. The order counter could be a bit more spacious. Good staff, food ready in a timely matter. Parking could be better. I would recommend this place, come check it out!</Review>

Wow! What a gem! The food here is delicious and they have about 3-4 agua. The sitting room is relatively spacious. Parking, however, is not, so make sure to carpool.<//Text>

The food here is good but I only took off a star because they unplug the phone so they don't take phone orders but other than that it's good.</Review>

<review>The food was amazing. Its our first time here, we just moved to the area. I ordered the #2 California and sat down and about 7-10 minutes later I received my food, fresh. The flavor is just beyond amazing and the Horchatha is the best I've ever had. Great service, very polite and kind. I definitely recommend this place.<//review>< Pics>

Handmade tortillas, excellent carne asada, Tortas are bomb, good breakfast choices, beer, need I say more? They also have good service. I've been here a few times and will keep coming. Taco Tuesday special is awesome. $1.25 Asada, $1.00 pastor, chicken, etc.<//Review>

They didn't have chicken for my tacos, so stuck with asada. The meat was unseasoned and over cooked.
Only good thing was the tortilla on my meal.< /Review>

Recent transplants to Highland and we found Dos Amigos through Yelp. One word to describe the food, delicious! Every torta we have had has been super good. We love their fresh chicharons, we never fail to get them when we go. The horchata is super tasty and rarely makes it home when we get take out.< /text>

Everything was amazing, service, ambiance, and flavor of the California burrito and carnitas burrito. Next time we're gonna try the tortas and tacos.The only thing I *hated* was how wet and messy the california burrito was which caused it to fall apart almost instantly and the fact that the fries were on the burned/dry side.<//Review>

Very good tortas which I had for the first time.  Their watermelon juice tasted like your drinking watermelon and was good.  The waiteress were constantly cleaning tables and serving food.  I think it could be better if it the restaurant was more pleasing cosmetically.< /text>

Love this place. They make over 15 different types of tortas! I come here once a week when I wash clothes. Staff is friendly, food is good, atmosphere is chill. Highly recommended.<//text>

<Review>Tortas are by far the best we have had.  We tried the steak and egg, the carnitas, asada and the pastor tortas).  No one in our family was disappointed (I wasn't able to take pictures because everyone finished them too quick).  This was our first time there, but will not be our last. Definitely recommend it.<//Review>< Pictures>

The food seemed like it was old the menu was very limited the ice machine didn't work along with half the soda flavors not working ordered a asada burrito and it was mostly rice and the little meet that was in it was mostly fat the tortilla was hard and stale o and also they ran out of beans it wasn't even late in the evening how do you run out that fast the dinning area was dirty with piles of trash swept up and tables sticky</Text>

This place will make you cry, Their food is amazing. The tortas come with a slice of cheese and they are grilled on one of those panini grills . Do yourself a favor and go get 5 Tortas.</text>

Dos Amigos is DEFINITELY the place to go when your in the mood for Real Mexican food! I had some Tacos and Tortas with one of their famous Micheladas and it just got the spot, especially their staff as well, very friendly. I personally want to thank Isabel for being polite and letting me take my time ordering, true customer service. For sure not my first and last time Here!< /review>

<text>If you LOVE Mexican food...this place is a must. Hidden gem in the city of highland.  Keto friendly...for an appetizer you can get chicharrones and guacamole. And an all meat burrito and just don't eat the flour tortilla obviously.  Everyone else....i got chicarrones and guacamole for an appetizer with a cold michelada.  And then had a Ranchera torta. The torta was very tasty and spicy enough to enjoy... ok it was hot!  The spicy mayo, ranchera meat, avocados, refried beans, grilled habaneros and other peppers as well as melted panela cheese are hugged by telera roll thats has been pressed like a panini. It is share-able...but too good. 🤤So get your own!!< /text>< time>

Tasty food!! Better ingredients at a modestly priced. One of the last restaurants using real "Ranchera"!! The combination of ingredients for numerous tortas makes for a delicious treat. Asada, bacon and avocado, fresh cheese etc... try this little gem. Hand made tortillas & Menudo too!!!😉</Review>

This place is hit and miss. The first time I came the torta was bomb. Next time it kind of sucked you can tell the asada was made hours ago. I dont like paying 10 bucks for a weak torta. Also the horchata is bomb but they put mad ice in it so they kinda skimp on it for how expensive it is.< /Text>

I dont like paying 10 bucks for a weak torta. Also the horchata is bomb but they put mad ice in it so they kinda skimp on it for how expensive it is.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Beer is overpriced, #11 carne asada torta was ok, the floors are severely uneven, waitresses are unorganized, waited over 25 minutes to get my meal, this one waitress swept the floor and instead of picking it up with a dust pan or anything she swept it into the kitchen area!!! The limes were stail and had pieces of cheese on them...</review>

Don't forget Taco Tuesday Street Taco's are 99 cents,The Tortilla's are hand made in the restaurant fresh daily also you have to try one of the fresh fruit drinks agua Frescas .. Yum !<//review>

<text>My husband loves this place. Especially the tacos al Pastor! My son enjoys the quesadilla and fries, and I either get the fajitas, huevos a la mexicana, or California burrito.

I came for take out on a Friday evening and it was pretty packed. Glad to see a mom & pop doing well!< /text>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
My family loves Dos Amigos Tortas! I like to rate Mexican food restaurants on their been and cheese burrito. If you get a bean and cheese burrito at Dos Amigos, it will make your heart sing! The chicken tacos are also fabulous...my kids love them w everything on them and those girls are picky eaters! My husband loves their al pastor. The staff is friendly. The only thing I would say that is a bummer is the agua frescas are tooooooo sweet for my taste...but that’s just personal preference, they always have a great selection and for people who like sweeter drinks, I’m sure they’re perfect!<//Review>

<Text>Best customer service with the old girls tht worked there for a long time... The Tacos, Tortas,  & milk shakes are the best.. Before i liked the Sopes & the asada 🍟 fries ,now there so hard & crunchy.. I complained to the Manager but the gossip went to other ears & the cashiers & other workers gossip in front of customer's face. Not no professional. So i decided to change my rating 🌟 star.</Text>< user_name>

BEST TACOS I've ever had in all my 42 years of living! All tacos are on fresh handmade corn tortillas & have guac sauce-served with sliced cucumbers &limes-tortas are also very yummy-nice soft-thin bread and a big variety of fresh fruit waters- everyone I bring falls in love with the spot-NOT a fancy place-but one of thise hole in the wall gems< /Text>

The food here is delicious hand made tortillas for the tacos loved it.. only thing is my fiancé and I went in last nite like 30 min before closing and the girl who took the order was either tired or not in the mood everything we where telling her we wanted it was  given to  us wrong it was  the opposite of what we wanted we wanted the tacos plain everything on the side... so their tacos come With guacamole luckily I like it but my fiancé is allergic and doesn't like onions  so we live about 30 min away couldn't go back tried calling the number on the receipt and was told we had the wrong number  so the food was thrown away I think they should be more attentive and not laughing talking back and forth when they have an order.. other than that girls bad customer service they're food is really good i would just make sure to check the order before you leave..</Text>

The tortas are excellent. I got the Dos Amigos torta the first time and I went back the next day and got the Carne Asada torta. They were both so good. The salsa was spicy and the agua frescas we're good (I got the cucumber lime, it's very sweet and sour).<//Text>
