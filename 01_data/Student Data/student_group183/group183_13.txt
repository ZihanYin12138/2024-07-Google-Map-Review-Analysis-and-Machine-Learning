<text>Honest Review!
Going to the dentist makes me anxious but Advanced Dentistry of Alhambra really alleviated a lot of my anxiety. For one, the staff are super nice and courteous. They make sure to check in on you and make you as comfortable as possible. Secondly, the Doctors here are amazing! I believe my doctor was Dr. Martinez. He answered all my questions and even made me laugh during my root canal procedure. That truly helped me calm down. The dental assistants and hygienist are super helpful as well. Third, the front staff and Frances were super nice.  Frances answered all questions pertaining to my insurance. I truly appreciate the customer service! If you are looking for a place that really cares about you, answers questions, works with you financially, and truly want your teeth to be healthy, then this is the place for you! I will be back!!!< /text><rating>5</rating>< Pics>

My smile has completely changed in the 8 months that I have been going to Dr. Martinez! I love my veneers and he really focused on making sure other procedures had been completed before performing cosmetic work. Highly recommend!< /text>

I've been going to Dr. Dara and her team for four years now, and every single time I've been treated with care and respect. I used to hate going to the dentist, but every single person here is so wonderful and welcoming. The procedures are relatively painless and they take care to make sure you're comfortable. And when they recommend you floss more, it doesn't feel like you're being scolded - it genuinely feels like they're giving you (really good/healthy) advice and they want what's best for you.
If you dread going to the dentist, don't. They are wonderful here.< /review>

I had swollen gum and pain this is the 5th dentist I go to in L.A. County and finally helped me with providing the right sized crown on my back molar, I'm happy finally I found a good dentist I spent thousands previously and the pain wouldn't go away.  Good Customer service as well I do recommend this office.< /review>

About a week ago I had an incident that required immediate dental work, due to COVID-19 I was unable to get  hold of anyone in my regular dental office. I was referred to Advanced Dentistry of Alhambra and without any hesitation they were able to take me in. Francis is AMAZING, she walked me through the whole process, and made me feel as if I was an old patient. Dr. Dara was beyond helpful and thoroughly explained more than imagined.

Best dentistry that I have ever been to! Open late hours and on Saturday's to accommodate all types of schedules. The front desk staff are polite, professional, and treat you like family. Dr. Dara and her dentistry team are excellent in what they do. They take the time to speak to you during your appointment and really care about your dental health. The facility is clean and has ample parking. Highly recommended!</text>

Best Dental Office Ever!
From start to finish you will receive amazing customer service. Yessica and Francis are amazing, they man the front and greet you by name when you walk in.  The doctors themselves are extremely professional and take the time to give you the best service possible. Dr. Martinez does amazing work, he is super gentle and really takes his time. Constantly checks in while he’s working to make sure you aren’t in any pain instead of you suffering through it all. The hygienists are very good, my teeth feel like a million bucks after they clean my teeth! Lastly, you’ll be well taken care of at this office, they never disappoint me.< /text>

The team here is very nice and honest. A few years ago, I was told I needed to spend a few thousand dollars to have a root canal done. The honest doctors here instead, wanted to preserve my tooth and tried alternative ways to be less invasive. I feel like they care for my oral health and are not trying to make an extra buck off of me. A MAJOR PLUS is when they slowly numbed me so that the process was minimally painful. They are great!!!<//Review>

For me, I work late hours during the weekdays so I am unable to make it during their normal business hours, but they help schedule me to come in on Saturday mornings which I prefer and that to me means a lot because they work with you to try and fit your schedule.

I’ve been coming to this dental office for the past 2 years and I can honestly say that the entire staff are amazing. From the moment you walk into their new office location in Alhambra, you immediately feel welcomed and they make sure to provide you with the best service possible. The doctors do amazing work and they really take the time to explain the procedure with you and to make sure you don’t feel any pain or discomfort. They are always there to answer any of your questions and make you feel at ease. All in all, you will leave the office with a good experience.

If you are in the area and are in need of some dental work done or maybe looking for a new dentist, I highly recommend this Dental office to everyone as they really care about their customers and provide amazing customer service.< /review>

I don't usually like dentists and hadn't been in a while when I first went to Dr Dara's office a few years ago.  The staff is always friendly and made me feel at ease!  They have helped me slowly get back on track and take care of the things I was neglecting due to not having good experiences at the dentist in the past.  I really kind of enjoy going to the dentist now :) thanks to Francis and Dr Dara and everyone else for all there help! I definitely recommend it!</text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I've had a few visits now at Advanced Dentistry of Alhambra, the level of care has been the best I've had in years! The staff are all lovely, positive people that make for a warm atmosphere in the office. The office is also very modern and well equipped compared to what I've experienced elsewhere.

Dr Martinez has been great, he takes the time to explain the procedures and why he recommends them, which put me at ease understanding things beyond the obvious 'you have a cavity.'  He was also very attentive while working on my teeth, it was a fairly painless experience all things considered for the work I needed.

I would definitely recommend Advanced Dentistry of Alhambra!</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>If you are in the area, I highly recommend that you come here for your dental work like I have for over a year. The staff are very friendly and informative, always making me feel welcome or answering any questions I have. Their professional knowledge is great and and they offer a good variety of services too. I used to be hesitant about dental work because of some poor, even painful, experiences at other offices, but it's always been great each time here. Again, I highly recommend them.</Review><GmapID>0x80c2c511867de763:0xdd827f501033e941<//GmapID>< UserId.>

Being afraid of needles and constantly dealing with dry mouth, I was worried about going back to the dentist after a long time. I needed A LOT of work done and not only did they work with me financially with each appointment and procedure, they provided excellent and timely service. Dr. Martinez takes an extremely gentle and educational approach to dentistry. I couldn't be more happy with my experience at advanced dentistry Alhambra! Thank you × 1,000,000 !</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Dr Dara and her team are amazing!! I was looking for a new dentist after moving back to LA. I had some some previous periodontal issues and they got me on a cleaning plan that was tailored for that. I also had some cosmetic issues and decided to get my first crowns with them. From the financial planning, prep, to the design of the crowns, Dr. Dara and her team were very accommodating and I felt very much cared for during the whole process. Dr Dara took time to make sure my crowns were customized to match and fit and they did!!</review>< Resp>

By far one of the best dental offices I’ve been to. Dr. Dara is a master at her craft and has taken very good care of my teeth as well as my hygienist Wylene who always brings her A GAME when cleaning  my teeth and is very pleasant! Can’t forget to thank Yessica for helping me stay on top of my appointments! An all-around wonderful experience highly  recommend this office.</Review>

I don't like dentists, but I do like Dr. Dara and her staff.  Recently I had gone in due to major tooth pain.  The day before the 4th of July I could not even lie down due to my pain.  At 6:00  that evening, I called the office to leave a message, and just thought I was going to go for 2 days with major pain.  I was surprised to find Frances in the office, answering my call, and letting me know that Tuesday is their late day, and to by there by 7:00.  I was just about in tears due to the pain.  I got to the office, they took me right in, and they stayed with me, working on me for over 2 hours.  Dr. Dara was so wonderful, I kept apologizing for making them stay late the day before the holiday, but she kept saying, we are here for our patients.  I can not thank them enough.  Also wanted to mention a thanks to Dr. Martinez and Dr. Dang, also extremely good.< /text>

<Text>I fell victim to the Deep Cleaning scam here also, I go to the dentist religiously and take care of my teeth. I just started going here because I moved far from my old dentist. It shocked me when they did my gum measurements, which was painful because it was pushed so deep to record astronomically high measurements. Never had I was nearly double my last measurements. They said I needed a deep clean, I was so shocked. I went ahead with it, then Francis said I needed to pay 50% of the cleaning which, I was not comfortable with. What kind of office takes money before the procedure when they are supposedly certain the patient would need the procedure. I was only comfortable paying half of it. So I paid half and my insurance and got the deep clean done. It was excruciatingly painful way more painful then I remember getting it done a decade ago. Anyways, my insurance covered it, because I've had a deep clean a decade ago.

Then I went on to read these reviews and it all makes sense now, they push the deep clean to everyone and roll the dice to see if the insurance would pay for it. This is why they collect money up front so you lock into doing the procedure. They rush you into doing the deep clean within the week so they don't have to file the preauthorization with the insurance company, because I called my insurance the day after the office said I needed a deep clean, all the office has to do is file a predetermination claim with the insurance. How does a dental office, not know this? they just want your money. I may or may not have needed a deep clean, but from the way they handle business and how I'm reading they treat other people the same way, I will not be going back here. If they suggest the deep clean, get a 2nd opinion, Shady business.<//Text>< pics>

I really do not like going to the dentist, but if I find one I like I will stick with them.  I recently started going here based on a referral from someone at work.  I travel 20 miles one-way now (in LA traffic) to go. I will gladly make this trek based on their work.< /review>

I met and was treated by Dr. Martinez for the first time. Of course I was a bit apprehensive but in little to no time, I felt like I did with my other doctors there.

<Review>I must say I'm very pleased with my dentist Dara Gashparova she is very professional and funny, she explain what she is going to do and always asking are you ok. I feel she takes her job very serious she explains to her helper what she is doing and why I feel she is a great teacher also. So if you are looking for a dentist that is compassionate and caring this is the one. She has moved to this new place on 70 S Palm Ave. Alhambra it seems to be top of the line beautiful and clean. Oh don't forget the great staff she has.

Thanks,
Mrs Taylor

I have been attending the Dental office, of Dr Dara Gashparova for about  5 years. The staff are always polite, and have good customer service skills. They are flexible when I can't make it to an appointment, and will help me reschedule. I have never waited for a long period of time during an appointment.The Dental Hygienist Wylene Jiung is courteous, and has pleasant manners. I always walk out of the Dental office content with the superb job Jiung does. Dr. Martinez has done some dental work on my teeth, and I am please with his work. He listens to any dental concerns I am having by making suggestions. Dr. Martinez always does a satisfactory job in explaining any procedure before he starts.Dr. Martinez, is a professional in his practice, amiable, and has polite bedside manners.< /Text>

Their gas pumps literally pump at 1 gallon every 60 seconds. If you are filling up your car, you will be here for 15 minutes.</Text>

If I could give them a negative 5 star rating, I would. Their pumps don't work and they rob you of your money. Not to mention they refuse to acknowledge that they don't work and say you don't know anything about cars.<//Text>

I wouldn’t recommend this gas station to anyone, they have  broken gas pump that don’t work. They send you to a different pump just to find out all the pumps are broken and they cheat you out of your gas money. Rude Indian lady ever gave me the wrong change at that. I would rate 0 stars if I can. I would never return there again.</review>

< review>

They picked appropriate time and made the work very quickly as promised and accurate as well. Highly recommended!</review>< Pics>

<text>I got into a fender bender with my dad’s car (he currently has mine, as we had switched cars for the time being) and had my insurance hook me up with the closest repair shop that they work with, which ended up being Caliber Collision down the street from me. I brought my car in and Ricardo was very communicative in what he thought needed to be done to get my car back into shape. Upon disassembly, Ricardo called me back in so he could explain what he found on my vehicle that may cause complications when replacing parts. He took the time to chat on the phone with my dad, going line by line on the summary of parts that needed repair or replacement and was very thorough when answering all our questions. Not only did my dad’s car come back fully repaired, but they cleaned the interior and exterior of the car as well! Also, what previously was a 2-3 week estimate, my car was finished in 10 days. Thank you so much, Ricardo and staff!< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1619458658469, 'text': "Hi Rachelle, thank you for your wonderful review!

Lennell was a great point of contact, led me patiently through the entire repair process, kept me up to date on repairs (rather unfortunate extensive damage) and the shop did a beautiful job restoring our beloved Fusion Hybrid; you'd never know it was in such bad shape for a moment! Cleaned the inside of the car (which was trashed by our toddler pretty bad) as a courtesy. Hope to not need their services for a while but will definitely return here if there is ever a need!< /Text>

<Review>Excellent customer service and attention to detail. I brought my car in absolutely last minute for touch-up work due to minor scuffing on the right rear passenger door, trunk lid, rear bumper because of a poorly aimed soccer ball. Both Sheldon and Danny provided thorough and honest advice on what needed to be done, the effects and what to look for when they are finished. Work was completed within the day and pricing couldn't be any better. Very happy with the quality of work and would recommend this facility to anyone needing auto repair or touch-up work.<//Review>< pics>

Back in August we brought in our Nissan Murano to FCC.  The involved repair job took 3 weeks and the service was seamless and smooth.  That's very important during every car repair situation, as it's always stressful for car owners.

We had an incident where our car incurred some body damage.  Nissan Sunnyvale referred us to FCC, so the tow truck driver took us here.

After we called our insurance State Farm, they told us that the other 2 FCC locations were on their certified body shop list, but this FCC was not (yet).  This location is their newest shop.   Even though they are not State Farm certified, State Farm could cover if the shop quotes and meets the insurance adjuster's estimate.

Throughout the whole process, FCC kept us informed of the State Farm quote process, and were able to keep the repairs within the State Farm estimate, even with a couple of minor adjustments for additional required work throughout the job.

At the end everything was fixed smoothly, with very smooth service from State Farm as well without any issues incurred on our side.

Danny at FCC was very helpful from FCC and made the experience very calm and the estimates very clear so everything was understood, and all payments were clear between State Farm, FCC, and us.

A great experience for us, even though you never look forward to going to an auto body shop.</Text>

"Uninsured cyclist ran red light, crash into wife's van, I did not have ""Collision/Comprehensive"". So it's all out of pocket for me :-(
FCC was recommended by my regular mechanic. Worked with Danny C @ FCC. Very reasonable quote and worked with me to get the best possible prices.  Very professional work and right on budget with zero surprises.  The job was completed one day ahead of schedule and the progress was communicated to me all along the way."</Text>

I worked with Danny at this location -- he goes well beyond the call of duty, that's for sure.  I was  impressed with FCC in Sunnyvale even before the work was started.  They know how to greet their customers with respect and work with them in every way.  I had no hesitation scheduling the work to get done at this shop -- didn't have to shop around.  I just knew these guys would be great.  Our new Nissan was damaged in an accident so I took it to our dealership in Sunnyvale and they recommended FCC as a certified auto body shop and told me their workmanship was great.  It is very clear to me why dealerships trust and recommend FCC Collision Center.  The workmanship on our new Altima was so good that we took our 1997 Lexus LX450 there for a quote on a paint job.  Danny, again, worked with us.  He goes out of his way to accommodate us -- the customer.  He is truly a great asset to this company and I can't recommend him or FCC enough.  We are going forward with the paint job, and I am confident I will, once again, drive away feeling completely happy that I used these guys.  Thank you -- both Danny and FCC Collision Center for making this such a wonderful experience.  You definitely know great customer service.  Keep up the great service!<//Text><Date>1349988376230</Date>< user_name>

We needed a fender repair on our Nissan Leaf. Our previous experience with body shops had been poor to mediocre. After phone calls to Mercury Insurance and Nissan and quite a bit of Googling, I decided to call FCC on Arquez. It is family-owned, Arquez was convenient, and Nissan recommended them. Also, FCC had the fewest poor Yelp ratings online, although I do take those with a grain of salt.
I called on a Friday and Sheldon walked me through the entire process on the phone. I made an appointment for Monday am and called Mercury. Although FCC is not on their "list," Mercury coordinated with them right away.
When I showed up Monday, the office was clean and bright and they had already started a folder for me. Sheldon walked me through the paperwork. He and Danny are very polite and professional.
It took about two weeks to get my car fixed because they had to wait over a week for a part from Nissan. FCC had it ready to go after just a few days and coordinated with Mercury to extend the car rental.
When I picked up the car, it looked great and was clean inside and out. Sheldon said to contact him if anything shows up in the next few weeks.
All in all, a very positive experience. FCC is now my body shop of choice. And, this is fhe first review I have ever written for any good or service.</Text>

That was by far the greatest experience I have ever had, the staff is amazing and extremely personable, I felt like family when I was there, and they made my lancer look brand new. Would recommend them without a second thought.<//text>

Coming to the work, a new bumper was placed and painted well. Now after a month, I didn't see any problems and feel that FCC Sunnyvale team did a good job.</text>

If your looking for a place to go so that you can enrich your Community, support your Country, and share some great Camaraderie, then look no further.
Orange Elks #1475 is home to a great group of people that will make you feel welcome at their Lodge.</Text>

Hands down the best place to get tacos. I've been going there since childhood. That's approximately 30+ years now. I live in Madera near Fresno and I'll still drive to Redwood City just to get these tacos. They are delicious!!!<//Text>

<Review>They've finally reopened, and tacos are as good as always.

I believe that they are still CASH ONLY.

Carnitas tacos are my favorite and go-to.  Their horchata and tamarindo are delicious!

Sometimes the line may seem long, but it moves very quickly. Make sure you have your receipt on hand, as they'll ask to see it when you grab your order from the window.<//Review>< Rate>

Prices are RIGHT and so was the flavor. I was so excited to get an asada burrito but they only took dinero and I had 3 whole dollars in my pocket. So got a taco only but enjoyed it thoroughly. The slightly pickled (i believe!) carrots were quite nice actually and first time I saw that w tacos. Have seen radish before and now prefer the carrots, ha!! Friendly staff ☺️< /review>

This place has the best tacos I've ever had! Maybe the cheapest also. Hard to beat $1.60 /taco.  I always ask to get them with the spicy red sauce instead of the mild stuff, and I definitely recommend doing that.</Review>

Good tacos. Hole in the gas station. No seating. There’s probably going to be a line. Found a hair once but it still tasted good.< /review>

HORRIBLE the ladies that work there are super rude they don't wear gloves and touch the lettuce with her hands, then they collect the money. Never seen something like this before!! They need cleaning and remodeling that location ASAP and owner needs to know how rude the employees are! I love so grullense but this was disgusting!!!</Review>

It's the yummiest by far..not your most healthy food but delicious. Make sure to try chicken sopes. Oh there's many other El Grullense out there but, be certain it say E&E.  If it doesn't say E&E, It's not worth the calories.<//Review>

Hands down, the best tacos in the area! I'm almost scared to give away this secret spot because I don't want them to get busy and start having a long line.<//Review>

We went to a Copa America game at Levi Stadium and it was after 10 p.m. on a Monday night. We stumbled on this place about 20 minutes away from the stadium and it appeared to be the only place open that late. We were surprised by the value and flavor of their tacos. All four of us ate at least 3 tacos each and had agua frescas for under $30. The carne asada tacos were good, but just be careful if you get "everything" on your tacos if you're sensitive to spicy salsa. This place was pretty popular considering it was a Monday night and there weren't any tables, but it was fun eating on the side of the window.</text>

(Translated by Google) Today, September 6, 2016, I had a bad experience on this site. The person who works as a cashier charged me almost $ 10 to cancel my order. I told him that I no longer wanted to buy and wanted my full money returned with me and still he was charging me. For people who buy on that site they have to be careful of this bad behavior of the worker who works at the checkout.

(Original)
El Día de hoy 6 de Septiembre 2016 tube una mala experiencia en este sitio. La persona que trabaja de cajera me cobro casi 10 dólares por cancelar mi orden. Yo le dije que ya no quería comprar y quería mi dinero completo devuelta con migo y aun así me estaba cobrando. Para personas que compren en ese sitio tienen que tener cuidado de esta mal comportamiento de la trabajadora que trabaja en la caja.</Text>

<text>Love this place! I just got my safety license, which is now required. The range is beautiful and the instructors are really informative.  The South side is open for archers, during certain hours, for target practice.  Great people who are extremely respectful.  This range has been open for 84 years so some great history here.<//text>< pictures>

It's a very nicely kept range. The covers portion is for 10 and 20 yards. The field section goes from 20 to 100. Range rules are pretty much the same as many others. No broadheaded arrows,  no crossbows,  5 minute windows before going down range. It is "recommended" that you bring target pads. Basically 3-5 layers of foam to protect the hay bales. People are very friendly and the area is nice.< /Review>

<text>Oh em gee, I'm still riding the archery high. Haha. No but seriously, this was so much fun. A must-do! I never got to go to camp as a kid *tear* so I had no idea what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised by how organized this event was. Kudos to the Woodley Park Archery Range for putting this on.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Spacious park with plenty of parking, shade and entrances and exits pass/behind The Japanese Gardens.

There's lots of picnic tables and room to enjoy a day out with friends, family, etc.

The playground equipment seems to be in use but not sure who often it's treated or taken care of as far as cleaning, etc.

The area is very lush and green and they have a few bbq bits as well.

Some cool paths as well and trails to the Sepulveda Basin and natural wildlife.<//Review>

We have been waiting here for awhile so the gate can be opened and got no help from the number listed on the website. Don't know who runs the range but not very responsible and a total disappointment. I'd find another range.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

The free class either Saturday morning or Wednesday night, are very informative and fun most of all. They even give you a few pointers if they see you're struggling to hit the target. Definitely on my to do list whenever I am able.< /Text>

<review>This is a decent range with fita distances available and a covered range (lit at night!) to 18m. Archers all shoot from one line, which makes it much safer than many other public shooting spaces. There is officially a 5min time limit on ends, but shooting is untimed and unsupervised, so the actual pace of shooting varies widely. Bring plenty of water as the fountain nearby is sporadically functional.</review><time>1533244025857</time></record></dataset><record>

Great place to take a novice that wants to get into archery on Saturday mornings.  Can get a bit crowded, and there have been a few times where I just drove away after showing up and seeing the crowd. Unfortunately on slower days you'll get the occasional homeless man wandering through causing a scene, and I wouldn't attempt to use the public bathrooms for both sanitary and physical safety concerns.</text>

Wicked short range and long range fields. The free lessons are cool too, but they get full quick. Make sure you get here early if you want a spot.<//Review>

Besides the lack of shade, the range is well kept and people are really friendly. The range is split into two parts, 20 - 45 yards and 50 - 90 yards.</text>

Ok let’s say they have good drunken noodles but a tad to lite, the bbq and shrimp fried rice , bbq is sweet and shrimp is non existent a shame service ok ambiance is good. Sorry won’t be back , it a shame there are so many Thai restaurants out there and what they need to realize is that they need to keep customers coming back and for what I had it didn’t make me want to sadly</text>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>We have been coming to this restaurant for at least 4 years. The food was good for the “price” and the service was great, very friendly staff.
We have been supporting them along with our other favorite restaurants all through Covid. Tonight we ordered our regular food; pot of tom Kai coconut soup, large white rice and an order of Paradise fried rice. The total was over $36. When we looked at the bill, the base price of the Paradise fried  rice went up from $11.95 to $15.95, an almost 35% increase (along with everything else, although they are still using the old menus so you don’t know how much the food is until you get the bill) I understand that times are difficult and restaurants have been especially hard hit with Covid so I could have accepted the price increase but then they also charged us $3.00 extra for the shrimp because unlike before at $11.95 that included both chicken and shrimp now it only includes one, to have both its extra. So in order for me to get the same dish as I had before at $11.95, it cost us $18.95, an increase of almost 60%!!! So not only did they increase their cost but they also give you less for more $$. Unfortunately I will no longer be supporting this restaurant, the value simply isn’t there.< /text></record>

I absolutely love this place! My boyfriend and I love coming here. Sometimes they even give us an extra thai tea with our order, we like to order a couple different things and share. Everything is absolutely delicious and they are so sweet there! Highly recommend and 10/10!< /review>

<text>No complaints as to the service or friendliness of the staff. I ordered the thai noodle boat soup and the crispy calamari. Neither was not good and I ended up throwing most away in the trash. I have tried their pad thai and other noodle dishes and they were okay.</text>< Pics>

<Review>The food is really good here. I live nearby ao when I want thai food I go here, but when it comes to take out it is not worth it. I ordered take out from them twice and both times they gave me very little meat. When I eat there they give me a good amount of mear but when I ordered takeout they gave me less than 6 pieces of meat and it was the small pieces of pork.</Review>< Date>

My favorite Thai joint near home. Friendly wait staff. Never overly crowded. Great lunch specials. Been going here for years and have never had a bad meal. Very authentic food  as can be, and I have been to Thailand so I can verify!< /Text>

Joom is a GEM!
The food is always fast, fresh and delicious
Never mind that lunch special is what you call bang for your buck.
The ladies who work there are lovely and attentive
A really nice staple in the neighborhood.</Text>

I used to go to this restaurant very often since my daughter used to live close to it. Now she lives too far from it and I have been eating Thai food at other restaurants in the Lakewood/Long Beach area. On a day that I was in Downey, I decided to go back. Seems it's under a new management. They changed the decoration of the dining room. It was very clean. The staff was different, not as attentive as the previous staff, but the menu seemed the same. Service was a little slow compared to my previous experiences. They keep the lunch specials, but I noticed that the portion size has been reduced. Still a bargain though. Food was delicious. I would say this is the reference I use whenever I rate Thai food. For me, this is still the best I have ever had. I'll definitely will go back if I'm in the Downey area.</Text>

The best place in town to eat Thai food. The owners are most lovely people and workers a like. The Cook is the best. I recommend to everyone in town or out. Check it out it's worth every penny in food and time. Perfect for couples.< /Review>

<date>1573944582685<//date><Text>Parking can be a challenge. The place is not very big. As you walk in it has an authentic feel, and you're immediately greeted. The food is good, the problem is the service. After you are served they forget you until it's time to pay. The food is too expensive for the level of service. I probably won't be back.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2cda042502fa5:0xc915cf45c3c4bb4d</Gmap_id><name>Geo Franco< /name><Rating>2< /Rating></record>

The food and service were very good. I would like to try the crab fried rice next time. The basic thai plates were excellent.
The minus 1 star was for the restroom, it looked like a restroom in Thailand. Come on folks, fix it up nice to compliment your nice establishment.<//Text>

<Review>Very delicious!  I ordered the Drunken Noodles. I am such a wimp when it comes to spicy food, but it was the perfect amount of spicy with tangy. I fell in love instantly!  I went in the afternoon around 4pm and the restaurant was slow with only about 3 customers.  The staff was extremely friendly and the cook/ owner even came out to see if we liked the dishes. Overall excellent food and service. It doesn't look like much on the outside, but inside is a true oasis. Extra points for a tasty Thai Tea! I am a regular now!<//Review>< userid>

<Text>COCKROACHES AND HAIR IN FOOD!!!

We found a hair at the beginning of our meal and a cockroach at the end of our meal. We spoke to the owner and he said “bring the food so i can complain to the chef” like what ????????
He didn’t want to give us a refund  BECAUSE WE WOULDNT TAKE THE ONE PLATE WE HAD LEFT SO HE COULD COMPLAIN TO THE CHEF???</Text></record>

You can order take out or dine in. I ordered the pad Thai, and it's not as sweet as I'm used to having it at other places, so that's pretty good for me. I will definitely go back to try other foods.

Food was good! But they need more employees! the wait time wasn't too bad, I was here on a Monday afternoon and if you like lime with your pad thai I suggest you bring your own, they gave us one little slice of lime for 2, then I asked for more and they gave me 2 more little ones, no biggie the taste in food is more important!<//Review>

I would not vist his restaurant anymore. We ordened orange chichen there was barely chicken in it. It was just like a crispy fried bread. The seafood soup which is 15 dls had only 2 shrimp and two sticks of imitation crab.The kan pao beef was watery and it was not spicy at all as it says in the menu and the meat was hard. The papaya salad was 9 dls I think it was pricy it was very small our bill was for 90 dls for 4 people. I dont mind paying that when the food is good and when it has enough I ingredients😞😞😞😞< /Review>

What is going on with this restaurant been coming for years and recently the quality of the food has gone down.  Ordered a wonton soup it was missing ingredients returned it and still was wrong. Service was very slow and very rude will not be going back again. Does not deserve a 1 star rating should be a ZERO.< /Review>

I don't like to give bad reviews. However; I know you're expecting an honest review. Anyway;  Zizzling Thai is the closest Thai restaurant to me for miles. So, Over the years I've overlooked a discrepancy here & there but this time it just went too far. I ordered a curry with fish because It's the ONLY meat I eat . they served me Chicken curry, so I sent it back. They thought I wouldn't notice that they brought me back the same curry in the same bowl with fish but failed to remove all the chicken 😜😝. BOOOOOO!
A total violation, disregard & disrespect for my beliefs and my health. They only want to sell you something warm. Not clean, not nutritious, not healthy or life supportive. Soooo Sorry! But I will NEVER return 😞.< /review>

Not for me, everything was far too sweet. Not bad, just not very good.</text>

Love trying new places for some veggie pad thai!!! This place has some bomb pad Thai. Only thing that was okay was the seafood soup. A little tooooooo lemony for my taste but everything was 👌 I will be back for the pad Thai< /review>

Loads of veggie options! Its hard to find a place that can have almost every choice pf meat replaced with tofu or veggies. Portions are fair and food has a good flavor.<//review>

My friends and I were in town for a dance conference, and we loved our experience so much that we came back the next day for more. They have friendly service and amazing food, the quality of everything was fresh and tasty. We especially loved the vegetarian egg rolls, they had a crisp shell and came with delicious sweet&sour sauce. The Pad thai was also a huge hit, both vegetarian and chicken varieties. The thai iced tea was delicious as well. We were dying to try the fried ice cream but we were too full to manage! Definitely coming back next time we're in town.<//text>

Okay restaurant with decent price. We used to go here often for lunch(close to work), but might not anymore since last Friday where there was a piece of chicken in my vegan order. I understand it might have been an accident but still don’t feel comfortable going here anymore.<//review>

<text>One of my favorite Thai places period. I think they just got a new chef, this place is soo much better Narai. Their Pa-nag extra spicy is delish' and the Spicy Basil Tofu and/or chicken is unbelievable. Nicer decor than before as well. I definitely recommend this place. Cheers!<//text>< Pics>

I had ordered the chicken pad thai, garlic chicken wings, and thai iced tea. I loved the wings. It was nice and crispy. Portion was good. Pad thai was a bit plain from the pad thai I had elsewhere. Thai iced tea was ok but needs more of the tea taste than half and half. Overall I was full. Recommend getting the wings. The 4 star is given as the host/waitress was very nice and offered water as I waited for my order since I did take out.< /text>

Tom yum goong too salty, at first they would load it with shrimp and mushrooms after a while it became less and less. Fried rice and noodles too greasy. After a few orders we decided to just drive all the way to panmivarn on Bellflower.  Food is great service is great enough said.</review>

I gotta say that Dr. Black is great. He's super busy -- and that's a good thing. This is Villa Park. Everyone is a millionaire so they all have super expensive genetically modified fur babies. If you feel that your time is worth more than others, please do not insult the good doctor's character.

If he can examine your lovely creature in two minutes, then you'll be outta there before you know it. This is a GOOD THING. Ain't nobody got time to dilly dally.

He's my first vet for a puppy and she was totally comfortable around him. His staff was kind and very knowledgeable. They were upfront with costs and their website has coupons!

Like the youths say these days, once you go Dr. Black, you never go back.<//text>

We decided to try Orange Canyon vet because our old vet in Irvine sold the business and we didnt like how the new owners ran the place. Way too many mistakes!
So far, we like the attention and service were getting, and they are so much closer!
If your looking for a reliable vet or animal services, give them a try!< /text>

Dr. Murphy is an amazing veterinarian and has wonderful bedside manner. She truly cares for my dog and three cats as if they are her very own pets. She takes time to explain everything and answers all my questions. Her staff are ALL friendly and welcoming, especially the tech Johnna. She is great with my grumpycat. The exam rooms and lobby are very clean. Not enough stars for this place!<//Text>

UPDATE! 2/15/2021 Another AMAZING trip to see my vet. Front Staff are so friendly and kind! Dr. MacDonald answers all my questions (and I have a lot), and has the best bed side manner. Her technicians love my cat and he actually purrs when he is with them, instead of stressing out. LOVE LOVE LOVE the service they offer!

Amazing client service at the front desk and the vet has outstanding bedside manner. Felt like this place treated my pets like their own. Very impressed by the caring people at Orange Canyon Pet Clinic. Won't trust anyone else with my fur babies!< /text>

The Dr is so nice and I love that they offer non anesthetic dental cleanings, but they tried to charge me $700+ to fix a kitten. They “forgot” to add charges to another bill that they tried to collect on later and they just don’t seem to care about my time. I live about 30 minutes away, cats just needed a vaccination, they said they would try to squeeze them in quick, an hour at the most. Over two hours later I called to see if they were close to being done, they had been done for a while and the front just forgot to call me. I’m literally sitting outside the window in my car staring at them. For the cost associated with this vet I just expected better service. Definitely looking for another vet elsewhere.</Review>

For my first time at Orange Canyon Pet Clinic, I am blown away at the friendliness and courtesy of the entire staff.  The leadership starting with Dr Lisa MacDonald and all the support staff made my experience feel like I’m visiting family.  All safety protocols are respected and ensuring my dog Eli was extremely comfortable for his check up.     I can’t wait to go back whenever required.  The 1 hour drive from LA to see this team is very well worth it! 🙏🏽</review>

Orange Canyon Pet Clinic is a gem of a find.  Dr. Murphy and her staff are incredible.  They are kind and compassionate, and always honest.  Phone calls are returned in a timely manner and the reception staff are very warm and Vet Techs AMAZING!  We LOVE Dr. Murphy and would encourage any pet parent to make Orange Canyon Pet Clinic their vet.< /review>

<text>I recently switched vets to be closer to my home.  Various neighbors of mine recommended Orange Canyon Pet Clinic so I thought I'd give them a try.

Absolutely LUV Dr. Lisa MacDonald and her team. My 3 dogs Shadow, Hondo and Koda were very happy as well. The team treats your animals as if they were their own and that's very important to me.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Dr. Murphy is absolutely the best. I have been with her since I got my boy Claude and would never use anyone else! She is straight forward which I personally like and gives you plenty of options if needed.</text>

The new owner, Dr. Murphy is amazing! My wife and I have been taking our pets to Dr. Murphy for over 10 years.  She is so good of a veterinarian, we followed her from her previous vet to her new practice here at Orange Canyon Pet Clinic. I feel bad that she inherited some of the issues from the previous owner/vet, but I'm confident all current and new clients will see how much love, care, and compassion she has for animals.

What makes Dr. Murphy so special is that she is a passionate vet. She doesn't rely on old practices alone, but rather continues to be aware of the latest in veterinary medicine and technology. For example, when our older cat, Mufasa, started having more difficulty with his irritable bowel disease (IBD), instead of adding more steroids, she switched him to a special diet and added a probiotic supplement. She explained to us that even though a higher dose of steroids may help address the IBD, it can lead to issues to the kidneys. And at his age (17 years old), the kidneys are already at risk. He has been doing fine since she adjusted his treatment. And his kidneys are doing fine as well.

Dr. Murphy has been with us and our pets through thick and thin. She was there for us when our other cat got cancer. She provided the best treatment and always took into consideration the financial aspect of the treatment. We knew, as did many of her other clients did, that she wasn’t going to leave any stone unturned, and she would work her hardest to provide the best treatment and care for our pets.

My wife and I have never met a vet that is as passionate, energetic, and knowledgeable as Dr. Murphy. We are thankful we found her years ago, and are happy she now runs her own practice.</review>

Dr. Kirsten Murphy has been my family vet for the last five years. She has seen us through some tough times with our elderly Labrador! She is compassionate and never makes you feel guilty when it comes to tough decisions. Dr. Murphy prides herself on being thorough and doing an exceptional job for her clients and their pets. I have referred countless pet owners to her and they give raving feedback!! Now we have a new puppy Rex and he loves her too!</text>

<text>This is the best vet office ever.  Dr. Murphy is the most caring, wonderful vet, and her staff is kind, friendly, and helpful.  Our pug has diabetes, and we need to inject him with insulin twice a day.  Everyone has been incredibly understanding by giving us information and help with shots.   We're so thankful for Dr. Murphy and her entire office.< /text>< Rating>

<user_id>108193001209879630332<//user_id><review>The first time I brought my cat to Dr. Black's office, he was crashing from issues involving his kidney disease. I was in the process of getting my cat ready for an expensive procedure that would have fixed his kidney issues, and had invested a lot of time and money in preparation for his kidney transplant. Being that Dr. Black was unfamiliar with my cat and my situation, I was forgiving of him when he refused to do the procedure that (ultimately) saved my cat, and felt that he was being genuine when he told me that the best course of action would be to let go and put my baby to sleep. I went home and prepared to do exactly that, going so far as to schedule an in-home euthanasia procedure. After talking with a specialist who told me there was still hope for my cat, I rushed him to the ER and got him the help he so desperately needed. Unfortunately, because I wasted most of a day in treating him, he dealt with some cognitive impairments as a result. I did not blame Dr. Black for this because I believed that, given all Dr. Black knew of my cat's health, he was making the judgment call that made sense from his professional opinion. That's why I gave this clinic a second chance.

Dr. Black told me that if I gave my cat the IV fluid treatment he needed that day, at best I would be buying him a couple days. This was in the beginning of January. My cat received the procedure elsewhere and survived just fine, up until today. For the past two months, I have been visiting Dr. Black's clinic to give my cat subcutaneous fluid injections to keep him hydrated and as healthy as possible. In this time, I have gotten to know and trust the staff working there, and had been building a good relationship with everyone in the front. I had a trip planned through my school to Florida for about a week, and because my cat requires special care, I asked if he could be boarded at Dr. Black's clinic while I was away. The receptionist was a bit hesitant because I mentioned that his health was starting to fade again (he needed another IV fluid treatment), but I told her that I would sign a waiver if they were worried and that I was confident that with constant IV fluids, he would be fine. I have talked to some of the top kidney specialists in the country and have had first hand experience with IV fluids counteracting and flushing the toxins that build up that cause a kidney cat to begin to crash. It was established that he would be coming in and getting the treatment I asked for, so I didn't think much of anything until the day that I dropped him off at the office.

To make a long story short, the clinic refused to perform the life saving procedures that I had requested and was willing to pay for after I left him there, and when I picked him up, he was covered in feces, litter, and vomit. His body temperature was 8 degrees below normal, he couldn't move, and he was on the verge of death. Dr. Black lied to my face about treatments performed that I was billed for (the bill contradicted what he told me to my face), his staff was rude to my mother (who got involved) and lied to her, claiming he was alive and in treatment after I had picked him up and had him put down elsewhere, and they completely failed me and betrayed my trust. This doesn't allow enough characters to tell the whole story, but if you have a pet you care about who needs urgent care, DO NOT bring them to Dr. Black. He is a complete and utter thief who is as heartless as he is incompetent.

Dr. Murphy acted compassionate when I talked to her on the phone and confirmed that with an IV flush, my cat should have been fine. When I submitted a claim to her insurance for the damage done, she went back on everything she said to me and lied to save herself financially. They did nothing to make this situation right beyond refunding the final bill, which was for services that weren't even performed. This place is the absolute worst.

RIP Seifer. I'm so sorry I failed you here in the end, and I wish I had never trusted these people with your life.<//review><pics>None< /pics><GmapID>0x80dcda929830ec5d:0x47e97c877af0f87f< /GmapID></record>

Dr. Black and his staff once again did not disappoint.  Our dog, Elvis, was greeted with hugs and treats.  Our appointment required no waiting and a full report of Elvis's health was provided and treatment was rendered.  We look forward to many more years!< /review>

I've been going to Orange Canyon Pet Clinic for about 8 years. I got a new puppy in 2009, a Chocolate English Labrador, and I have always brought her to Dr. Black. She is taken care of and loved even though she is friendly. She loves the girls in the office. She gets her regular baths there and her shots and when I was ill last summer spent about 10 days in boarding. I don't worry about her when she is there. I, also, have 3 cats. One 15 year old and two also born in 2009. They have been taken care of at the OC Pet Clinic exclusively and are always treated well.

I rate the clinic excellent.<//review>

Orange Canyon Pet Clinic has been wonderful helping take care of my dog. She has a bad autoimmune disorder that Dr. Black has experience treating, amongst other ailments, which puts my mind at ease. The staff is very friendly and accommodating.< /Review>

Dr. Black has doctored 8 of my dogs over the past 20 years. He was working with our original vet and we fell in love with him. We lost track of him for three years simply because he had left to start his own business and we simply lost touch.  As soon as I found him again, I immediately transferred my records to him.  Yes, his prices are higher but I have complete trust in his expertise and his talent. I could save money.  But I won't because my 20-year history has been superior. My dogs are my children and I insist on the best care.  His staff is the best.  Whenever I have checked in my dog I was given an itemized list of the costs.  This is the normal procedure.  This is the time the owner needs to tell them whether or not you would approve of the costs/procedures.  Once you sign the form, you are agreeing to the possibilities.  Frankly, I trust him so much that I've always told them to do what is necessary only.  Never have I felt over charged or was my dog over treated.  My dogs and I have always been treated like family.  I will stay with Dr. Black until I no longer have a dog.  And I plan on always having a dog.</review>

We have been clients of Dr. Black's for over 20 years. Yesterday our KC wasn't feeling well. The problem was quickly diagnosed, we went home with some meds and she' already feeling better. His staff is always so kind and professional. In the 20 plus years they have seen us through many difficult times. I have personally referred many people, including family members. Thank you Dr. Black and staff for always coming to the rescue! Cheryl & Gary Turner</Text>

My wife and I followed up on my son's cat that died after being mistreated at Orange canyon Pet Clinic. We were told the cat was still being treated after the cat was dead, and we were billed for that treatment. I don't think any more needs to be said about them.<//Text>

Took my Maggie, a 8yr old cockapoo, for her annual check-up. All labs were done, immunizations given, and discussed her skin and itching problems. She is to remain on her special C/D diet for her s/p bladder stones and surgery. Thanks to Dr Black and staff my furbaby is alive today. 4 yrs ago she was viciously attacked by a pitbull while we were on vacation. After 3 surgeries and multiple medications and a massive infection she is thriving. She is our little miracle dog! I have gone to Dr Black for many years. I also take my other 6 yr old cockapoo, Libbie to the Clinic.Dr B was finally able to get the magic itch mediciation which has helped my poos so much.Everyone there is so helpful and friendly! Would definitely recommend this Clinic.<//text>

Its never open at 6am. Nobody answers the phone.. About 7 parking spaces near front the rest is the shopping centre lot so if busy you'll be hauling your laundry over..Big washers work well n machines are always clean and working well. Maria is very hard working. Just wish they would open on time.</text>

That lady is a thief! She took my  microfiber towels out of the washer to top it off she help her self with  2 towels I confronted her about taking my towels, she has the nerve to tell me that she didn't grab any. Not mad that she took my stuff I'm just upset that she wasn't being honest<//Text>

I stopped by to do some laundry real quick and the washing machine I used started leaking water. The janitor told me to stop it and use another one. I asked if he could start up the one I switched to and he said he didn’t have any control of the machines or able to do a refund. He told me to call the number on the wall to get some assistance.

I called the number and got someone on the phone, but suddenly he hung up. I tried calling back, but it went straight to voicemail. Obviously this place doesn’t care about customer service. Good thing i don’t live here and it was a one time thing passing by 😂<//Text>

This laundromat is always clean. The machines and dryers always work well.  Maria, the attendant, keeps the environment neat and clean. She is very helpful and so kind in a very matter of fact way. I’m a black man, and Maria always treats me respectfully, even offering help, unsolicited! Incidentally, the other customers, who are overwhelmingly Latinx have always been cool as well. I feel welcome here and have been coming in and off for years. Thank you! Keep up the good work!</text>

<Review>It's a 10!!!! I love this laundromat it's a 10 but there is only 5 stars to give.. I called them I had 2 loads to wash I was already heading there and I seen on Google that they close at 10 it was already going to be 9:30…. So I'm thinking to myself what they close at 12.. So a employee named Maria answers and I ask her what time do you guys close?? I told her my problem and she asks me how many loads I say 2 and she tells me to come.. Maria says it NO problem I couldn't believe it so I get there I tell Maria I'm the that called she let's me wash, dry it was wonderful.. Maria even helped me with the washer and dryer she is awesome.. A wonderful employee man I think she needs a raise if you ask me..
Thank you very much!

This is the worst laundromat to go to. I came in at 9pm and the lady automatically started to rushing when I came in. She told me that I need to get my clothes in now! When I placing my clothes at 10pm into the dryer she started to rush me once again. She stated that I wasn’t going to have the time to fold. I would not recommend coming to this place. At night, rude customer service and attitude was given for everything. I felt extremely harassed and will never come here again. Also they close at 11pm even thought it states it closes at midnight and 12am on google. I hope they read this review and learn that rushing clients is not the way to go 😡<//review>

Woman named Maria, owner supervising, welcomed me, gave me big hug, she was cleaning out washers after customers left.  Very clean, new machines, quick and efficient.  I was able to "catch up" on backlog of laundry until I got new washer/dryer installed in my new home.  Thank you, Maria!<//text>

Dryers heat is not hot enough , took 3 quarters  to dry 7 tshirts.  I end up using  4 dryers to dry a normal load of clothing.<//Text>< Rating>

This is my first time here but a very bad experience the owner needs to change the hours in the website it says it’s open until 12:00 am so I came to do my laundry and the lady here tells me that is close and it’s only 9:15 pm big disappointment won’t be coming or recommending this place to anyone.

<Review>I came in the other day and was impressed by  the upgrades in machinery since I was last there. I love that I can get all my 6 loads of laundry done in under two hours! The attendant was very helpful and showed me how to operate the machines. I also like that the supermarket is nearby so I can go grocery shopping at the same time. I will be coming back. :)<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Anyone who's been coming to place for a few years must know Maria..Maria is very helpful lady and has a very good customer service. She helps everyone on how to wash and fold your clothes lol doesn't matter if its Male or female.There been times when I come in the morning I find the small washers to be dirty and I know Maria didn't work the night before because she stays cleaning and mopping the place all day long while she's here working..Maria is someone you can count on, I have tried other wash house before and didnt like then because was dirty and no one on duty...when you washing here and Maria is here working your time goes by fast because she keeps a conversation with you while she's working<//Text>

<review>worst washers ever, they don't rinse well, literally you have to star a new cycle to get rid of the soup and foamy stuff on yout garment after the cycle is complete. You complain to the Phone on the wall for costumer service and they will blame it on you arguing the way you distribute your garments inside the washers, never come back to this place, by the way there are cucarachas too(roaches)< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1569208345529, 'text': 'We are sorry to see a one star review- based on your pictures you posted with soap left inside the machine is due to putting too much soap in your load. You chose to use a machine with one rinse and we have other machines that have multiple rinse cycles if you like to use a lot of soap. It is a self service laundromat, but we do our best to take care of these situations by restarting a machine and showing the customer how to use it if it was misused previously (as was the case for you), but we did not have someone there to help at the time you called. As for bugs in the store, we have exterminators that take care of that but sometimes the bugs are brought in with the clothes customers are bringing in, which may have been what happened in your case.'}</resp><GmapID>0x80c34cb9a813d00d:0x336dd66a41ef8962</GmapID></record>

22 minutes for a $2 wash. This place is a rip-off. 24 minutes for a $2.50 wash. Definitely not worth it if you actually want clean clothes. Other places give you mid to high 30 minutes for the same price.< /Text>

To answer your question as you come in the front door the dryers that are on your right hand side I don't remember what the number was of the dryer but it wasn't working. As far as the weird washers are the ones that don't fill up with water but they just spray a mist which doesn't really rinse your clothes.
For a small amount of clothes I got to put almost a 1.50 to dry them when other laundromats up the street and relatively close to that one I put .75 my clothes get dry. I have to spend a dollar fifty with your dryers to dry them.  it's a small load easy in comparison somewhere else that cost is $0. 75 and your dryer it cost is a dollar fifty.
Oh I've even tried the dryers way in the back by the back door same problem. I believe you mean well, I think you just have a bad location or something something's wrong with that spot you're at.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>
{'time': 1535930878739, 'text': '******Response 9/18/18- to address your issue on the washers, we have two kinds of toploaders, one has a spray rinse and one has a full rinse. If you prefer the fill rinse you can use that type of machine. Some customers like the spray rinse, but we have the option to use either. Point is that we offer both types of machine. As for the dryers, we give you 8 minutes per quarter on small dryers and 6 minutes for the large dryers, which would be about $1 for 32 minutes. It’s recommended you go at least 30 minutes to dry, depending on what setting your clothes tag says you should dry at.  it isn’t an issue of the dryers not working per your review- they are new and they work fine, it’s just the amount of time your clothes require to dry, which we don’t really have control over******We are sorry to see you did not have a 5 star experience. It would be helpful if you can provide details including which washers you are referring to as “weird”. We have a few different washers, most of them are new, and they have different types of wash cycles. If there is a problem with the machines we like to know what machine so that we can try to fix it. Also, most of our dryers are new, and none of them are out of order. Please let us know which dryers you are referring to. Sometimes the issue is simply the user not understanding how to operate the machines, in which we try our best to educate our customers on how to use them so that there are no issues that occur because of misuse.

I like this place because it is very easy and to use my card or phone to pay for washing clothes since i don't carry cash. The only reason why i do not recommend it entirely is the older lady is kind of rude and does not seem to understand or know what she is doing. I used my phone to pay with my app since i forgot my debit card and the machine took $5 instead of the $2.50 like it had posted. When i asked her about it she simply nodded me off and said it wont take the money. I tried to show her that it did and she just walked away. Customer Service is not the greatest but it is also near some places to kill time if you are hungry.< /Text>

<Response>{'time': 1522597498802, 'text': "Thank you for the review. Your card will only be charged for the amount you use. The $5 is a temporary authorization that sets aside the amount in case you use it at the laundry. It will drop off the next business day and you will see charges for the machines you used. This prevents other charges from coming in and overdrawing your account. I'm sorry the attendant was not able to explain this to you and cam across as rude. I will discuss this with here to ensure we improve. Thank you again for your business and for your feedback!"}<//Response><user_id>102846242917282212705</user_id><name>Billy Guerrero (CentuaroGG)< /name></record></dataset><record>

My sister and I went to wash a heavy load. First of all my sister is full black and I have tanned skin. The old lady who is the attendant gave my sis a dirty look behind her back without knowing she was with me. Then had an issue with the heavy duty washer because it was not putting water in the drum nor was the time going down so I called the number that is posted. Guy was friendly and helpful told me to turn it on cold water instead of hot but he called the attendant and the attendant blaming the issue on me having too much clothes in the drum when there wasn't. Did not feel welcomed at all because of the attendant. Will not return.</text>

Just left this place the lady was sooo nice and works so hard, I felt so bad having to wash so late..if I hit the lotto Im taking her on a all expense vacation she does a great job at keeping the place clean and free of the homeless that fluent the area. This is the place to spend your money, machines are huge, they take credit cards, nice resturants, and good service.<//review>

I want to take the time to thank Maria for always helping me out even to the most smallest problem like my quarter getting stuck or the machines don't work. She is a very great hard working lady the laundry mat is ALWAYS clean! I hate the fact when Maria is trying to explain something to the customers and they respond in a very disrespectful manner when she is just doing her job. Im very glad that she works at this location and look foward to keep seeing her here in the near future. Once again thank you Maria for all your hard work and help!!</review>

I was sure that I was going to have a bad experience since seeing all the reviews ...and I was right .the machines don't even wash right I was disgusted. Never coming here again. Two dollars per wash what a nightmare...oh by the way those are the cheapest washers the rest are more expensive all washers should wash right the first time ..there was stains that easily come off in my clothes...smh<//text>

<Review>Used to come here alot. The old lady is very rude she just nags at everyone all day. It's like she hates her job. And yeah don't come after 9pm or else she tells you to hurry up because she is closing even though the sign says till midnight. Oh and you put money to get change and the machine doesn't give you anything and when you try to get a refund all the lady does is give you the run around. Only good thing to this place is that it's the closest laundromat to my house but other than that they need to get it together.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1519779988411, 'text': 'Sorry to hear you had a bad experience.

I use this facility only when my washer at home goes down. I dreaded the thought of doing laundry here . In the past I have had only bad experiences.  Dryers not drying and taking way to long to get it all done. To my surprise it was all madeover. New machines. Everything worked great. I would like to thank the owner for putting money into his shop. It was a great experience.<//review>

Rushed over because it says they are open until midnight. Door was locked at 10:40. The employee said last load at 10:30. I tried to explain that my clothes had already been washed, I just needed to dry them. The lady just ignored me. Between that and the homeless people hovering all around... I was greatly disappointed.</Text>

I have been there about 2 times and i liked it because of the hours well today i went and the lady that cleans is outside smoking which i have seen her do previously well today i was very dissapointed i showed up at 9:30 and apperently the last wash can start at 10:30 so as im approaching the door she says no you cant come in we are going to close at 10 well on google it says midnight and i mentioned that she says that was old management. So i told her well that should be updated and she just said again we are cloaing at 10 my bf asked once again can we please wash we will be quick she finally gave in and said yes but you need to hurry up quick. I personally did not like that i had also seen her take somone out becajse she said he was homeless. All i have to say is i wont be returning i felt very dissapointed with the way she spoke to us.<//Text>

I haven't needed to use a laundromat in over 20 years, and was feeling apprehensive and having awful memories! On top of that, I have an injured wrist and can't lift with my right hand. I was soooo pleasantly surprised. The washers as well as the dryers were clean and worked well. The location was clean and well maintained. It was not hot, humid, or smelly, nor did I see flies or other pests. The attendant was very kind, and went out of her way to help me. I will return when needed until my new washer arrives, and wouldn't hesitate to reccomend this place to anyone. Thanks so much!</review>

I would've given less stars but... They were the last one open at 945pm..
Rude attendant complaining that i came late she tried to tell me they were closing at 1030 but i pointed out that the sign behind her clearly said midnight, and it was only 945 and she said she has to close because shes been here all day...
To top off the unpleasant visit..it was unbearably hot inside...no fans or ac at all..<//Text>

<review>Love Costco. The only problem I have is They need a couple of Express lanes. Lots of times I see others along with myself that are getting like 3-6 items. And then your stuck in line behind others who have carts full of stuff. And the need to have smaller pkg of meat. They have great prices. But when your buying for 2 now instead of a family. The meat would get freezer burned before we could use it up.<//review>< date>

Come here, get some pizza, get some hot dogs, get some soda, heck get a chicken bake if you want; mix it up with some ice cream? I don't care. Come here to party, I'm down if you invite me.< /text>

Delicious food, great price. The temptation of pizza gets the kids through the Costco trip. Chicken bake is superb. Frozen yogurt is awesome. We are here at least once a week.< /Text>

The food is inexpensive but still decent. My kids like the pizza, as a busy mom this helps on those busy week days. If you order at grocery checkout you do seem to get your order faster as well. Also can't beat the price of the soda's and churro's which are my treats while there.< /Text>

<text>The Clovis food court- first they stopped cutting the slice of pizza in half but cut the full ones. Oh, some culture complained about cross contamination. The majority once again ruled by the majority. Now, for whatever reason, you can not pay for a slice of pizza at the check-out stand. Don't know if it's due to a system being down. I don't have time to stand in a second line for just that. If it continues, I the food court has lost all my business and probably Clovis Costco.<//text>< pics>

<Text>Just found out this place closed down when I drove by today. I've been going there for 30 yrs! So sad, the food was amazing, the staff so friendly, and I'll miss the ambience and memories. I even checked to make sure they were open before stopping by and it said open! 🤔🥲😥</Text>< Pics>

Great experience for my first visit.   Flavorful and inexpensive Mexican lunch buffet.  It's even cheaper than El Torito.  The food quality is good and tasty.  Options are limited but enough for you to choose from, and it will fill you up.  I came for their weekday lunch buffet 11am-2pm for $11.99.  Drinks are not included on the price.  Buffet includes menudo, caldo de albondigas, chile rellenos, rolled taquitos, chicken fajita, enchiladas, rice and beans, chile verde con carne, pork carnitas, salsa, pico de gallo, and much more.  Service staff are very helpful and friendly.  Plenty of parking.  I will definitely come back again.<//review>

I don’t know how this place has 4.5 stars. When I went during lunch hour (what should have been the busiest time) there was only two other people. I ate some of my sisters plate and I didn’t even make it home in time to throw up. Now I have to wash my car.< /Review>

I have been going to this place as a kid in the early 90s and still to this day my favorite dish taste exactly the same. This is a good thing. I love their flavor. Fajitas are bomb. Chips and salsa bomb. Tacos bomb. Its all bomb. Very consistent in flavor :)< /review>

Use to be a great place to eat. The last couple times I been here, the food hasn't been that great. Great and friendly staff. It needs an update, as it is very old. Pricing is good and the food option is good as well. They need better cooks.<//review>

Nice atmosphere, great food! The decor reminds me of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. The chips and salsa are really good, I can slam through 2 bowls before the food even hits the table! Always leaving way more full than I should be.<//review>

The service was quick and friendly. The burritos are huge. We each ordered one and we could have shared and still had leftovers. I ordered the pork burrito and they brought a chicken one, but were very apologetic and quick to replace it. I'll go back again!< /text>

We've been coming to Casa Gamino for years and have always had a good experience. Food is always good, service is always satisfactory, and prices have always been fair. The portions are always more than I can eat so there's always food going home for the next day.< /review>

<Text>Casa Camino is a friendly restaurant with a big menu, happy hour from 2 till 6 pm. They serve big portions of tasty food. I enjoyed a burrito Colorado which was good. The happy hour Margarita's don't have very much tequila in them. We liked the regular one, were you could taste the alcohol. I advise to ask for more tequila in the Margarita's or you will end up, sipping on some sweet strawberry ice water.</Text>< Time>

THIS PLACE IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!  If I could leave no stars, I would. There was a TOOTH PICK in my dads beans, a HAIR on my sisters fish and my “fajitas” were pure grease. All we wanted was to take the fish off the bill because we didn’t even touch it after seeing the hair but when they refused to give us a refund AFTER taking back the full untouched fish, we decided to also be petty and bring up the toothpick that stabbed my dad in the gums. The lady immediately LAUGHED when we told her and refused to give us any sort of refund. I will never return. Hear my plea  -  DO NOT COME HERE.<//Text>

To the Flores couple and their friend that gave this business one star.... Google reviews isn't a forum for entitled adult children to have a tantrum because a table wasn't available to be saved for you. You were either late 10 minutes for your reservation or you called them and wanted a table giving them 10 minutes notice during one of their busiest times. In either case that's on you not them.
Have a great day.
Having that been said. The food is delicious!<//review>

SO *expletive* GOOD!
Great rice and beans and tacos and chips and salsa. This is the restaurant I was trying to find for years while at CSUF and asked people for good Mexican food.  Really nice employees, too. (Be nice to them!)
I'm so glad I found it!< /review>

Where do I start this was my first time coming this afternoon once I was seated I was very hungry the girl who seated did not give me a name or offered me my drinks or tell me who will be my waiter so I drove all the way from Costa Mesa very ready to eat I saw it was a buffet I automatically went and got a plate and if it’s you’re first time here you should tell them right away because once I finally got my food from the buffet my waiter finally got to me and said how was I and yes still no drink I told him it was my first time and how dose this work and he told me well you already got the buffet so I already knew the type of service I was gonna get I don’t understand maybe because I look young but it don’t matter I still tiped the taco man 5 bucks even tho I know he didint want to stay cause he had to leave and also the waiter I wasint aware of the times or anything so I apologize if I made you’re job harder but I give this place a soild 1</Text>

<username>Aurora Allen<//username><Time>1524587835277<//Time><text>LOVE This place!   One of the best authentic Mexican buffets I've ever had. Even better on the weekends when they have a Fresh Grill making omelettes , pancakes and tacos.  The enchiladas go fast!!  Even have fresh ceviche  (shrimp cocktail) in the buffet.
They're buffet hours are daily 11am-2pm<//text><user>105695968611106100778</user></record>

Cute local place. Dated carpet just makes it cutely reminiscent of family/ grandma's style. Came for dinner. Food tastes fresh, made there. Great taste for the price, and quick service for a Sunday night. Done get the Chile relleno. Chips are good and really crispy and warm. Salsa was tasty and not toooo hot.< /Text>

<Review>We came here for my dads birthday. It was about 20 of us, they were good at accommodating us. The food was horrible though, we ordered the parrillada marisco and the chef, it was dry, overcooked, chewy and COLD. We though it was just us seeing as there were 20 of us, figured someone's food would be good. Out of morcajete, enchiladas, mojara, chicken nuggets and a few more items i think only the French fries on the chicken nugget order were OK. They don't seem to be trained to cook for a lot of people and its not like the restaurant was full, it was us and maybe 4 more people in the restaurant until the end when a few more showed up. The waiters did not come check to see if we needed refills or much of anything, we had to wave them down.  Restroom are right next to the kitchen which is to me not very sanitary and the restrooms smell like mold, i mean horrible. You really think twice if you really need to go because the smell is sooo bad. I have been to different Mexican restaurants and ordered parrilladas and this is by far the WORST place to eat mexican food. Will not be coming back, do not waste your time and money.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>I have been eating here for over 30 years. This has always been the most authentic and best tasting Mexican food that our family has enjoyed. It is well known to the locals for their delicious lunch buffet. Prices are fair and service is Great! If you love Mexican food this place will soon become your favorite restaurant!!!< /text>< username>

It was extremely busy...They don't put bleu cheese dressing in their salad bar so if you want some you have to pay an additional charge of $1.50 Every salad bar I have ever gone to has bleu cheese dressing as a choice so I think this is absolutely crazy to be charged for it!!!</review>

Authentic Mexican food at a great price. Casa Gamino has been around for decades and we will always continue going there. Great for a family birthday party or a breakfast get together with family. It also has a cozy little bar for those interested.< /text>

Don’t recommend this place. As soon as you walk in you can smell the old rusty place, creepy looking. Food was nasty and very pricy! Ew ew ew! My kids and I  Didn’t even finish our food wanted to walk out asap.< /Review>

The Chimichanga was fantastic however the spicy carrots and jalapeños tasted overtly like vinegar and looked  gelatinous. Not fresh at all!

Delicious Mexican food. Taco bar, omelette bar, freshly cooked pancakes, menudo, pozole, beef and fish soups. Salad bar and fruit and deserts too. Churros with yummy filling. Crunchy tacos, enchiladas, and flautas too. Chille rellenos and fresh ceviche. Wow and other yummy dishes. We went for the Sunday buffet or you can sit in the bar and order from the menu. Great service too. We will be repeat customers many times!!<//review>

<Text>We came for the lunch buffet (10-2) and thoroughly enjoyed it. The line for the breakfast food (omelets, pancakes, asada etc) was pretty long). There were flautas, tacos, enchiladas, chili rellenos, carnitas, chicken fajitas several soups (our favorite was the seafood soup). The service was friendly.<//Text><rating>5<//rating>< user_id>

I've been here multiple times, but only had their coffee which is a bit on the sweet side. I finally had their breakfast and went with the breakfast quesadilla. It was better than I thought it would be, but it wasnt the best breakfast I've had. My wife had the French toast and that was also very good. Their bread was thick like Texas toast and personally I love that! Overall it was a good spot to have b-fast.</review>

Large portions at very reasonable prices--  actually lower than expected.  Excellent staff.  They will even make things that aren't on the menu, so don't be afraid to ask.  I always get the Carne Asada plate with an order of fried platanos ( bananas).  They'll fry them plain, or add cinnamon and sugar.  They are wonderful either way and its always enough that I can take home leftovers for a complete meal the next day!!   They have a special lunch menu and a lunch Buffett. So far haven't come across anything that I wouldn't order or recommend.  Best Mexican restraunt in southern California, in my opinion.</text>< Pics>

I always love dining at Cafe Provence - a hidden jewel in Prairie Village. Very French but not intimidating at all.< /Review>

<Date>1541489202267</Date><Rating>4</Rating><review>Today, I went to one of my favorite haunt's when I was passing thru Anaheim. I frequently revisit a restaurant/Deli that I enjoyed previously.
Today, my mood led me toward Margaritaville (maybe hearing it on the radio
had something to do with it...do you think?)

Damn subliminal messaging worked again!
Anyways, I sat at the bar and said to the bartender "I need a damn good tasting Margarita like I'm use to...he smiled and said that he can make it happen.

He brought me my Margarita and said to taste it because I came in at a good time.
After sipping it twice (I wanted to make sure before I spoke.)
I told him that it was a damn good tasting Margarita and will enjoy the rest once I decide on what to eat.

It was at this time, that he handed me a small bar menu which had several different "Happy Hour" food selections that all looked delicious.

After deciding on the Burrito with the chunks of pork which was marinated with a green sauce inside. I asked if it we're possible to make it "Wet with the red enchilada sauce"
He said no problem because it automatically is served that way.

Circling back to when he mentioned about coming in at a good time, he told me the wet burrito was $7.00 and the Margarita is only $4.00..such a deal.

I responded with a smile and said "that is incredible and let's get this show on the road.
It was about 10 min.that passed and he was already bringing out this large wet size burrito (with ez on the melting cheese.)

Let me tell you, that I enjoyed every last bite as I slathered some sour cream on top. I took a breather for about 5 min. and then finished off the second half with equal enjoyment.
I want to thank the bartender who worked the early afternoon shift for making my visit an enjoyable one. As usual, I'll be back.
Thank you!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I have been there several times. My husband and I love the  chile verde that they have everyday for buffet.  But every time we have gone  we get really bad customer service . The waitress and a waiter have no good customer service. This last time I went I was having menudo So the waiter saw me looking at it and he asked me if everything was ok ? I said there are 2 small hairs in my menudo. He said well it's a buffet what do you expect !? I didn't say anything so he said give me the plate because my sure your not going to eat it anymore!. My husband and I just looked at each other and dicited not to go there any more.<//Review>

WORST COSTUMER SERVICE EVER! THE MANAGER THERE NEEDS TO TAKE SOME COSTUMER SERVICE CLASSES BECAUSE HE CLEARLY NEEDS THEM. WE ASKED FOR A TABLE IN ADVANCE AND THEY DIDNT WANT TO GIVE IT TO US. ONCE WE ARRIVED, THEY KEPT GIVING TABLES TO OTHER FAMILIES. TOTALLY IGNORED US. THE MANAGER BASCIALLY SAID HE DIDNT HAVE TIME FOR US AND HE DIDNT CARE WHAT WE NEEDED. WON'T BE COMING BACK HERE ANYMORE. USED TO BE OUR FAVORITE PLACE TO COME AND EAT AS A FAMILY, BUT NOT ANYMORE.<//review>

I liked this place because of its all you can eat breakfast buffet. Only a 4 star though due to the fact that it does seem a bit dirty</review>

The person who contacted the owner told us that they were sorry  but the cook is new. I understand that ,,, but a cook new or experienced shouldn't serve rotten food and they gave me $15 gift certificate, we paid $45 for that disgusting food, and I would like you guys to check your "To Go" orders before you leave premises, don't get a bad surprise like I did</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<name>cmilton111< /name><review>Changed my rating from 2 to 4 stars.. We returned to Casa Gaming yesterday even though I had previously said I wasn't going to return.  This visit I gotta admit the food was very tasty. I ordered a soft Carnitas taco, enchilada on the dinner menu (there menu is extensive). My meal was very good. They serve chips before we ordered; the chips were thin, warm and the taste is excellent. The salsa is good; I add Pica de Gallo to add flavor to chips and my meal.

Before this recent visit I said:

The food was okay (about 3 stars). The interior is also 3 stars, exterior 2 stars.

Big problem with this restaurant (my visit) though, the margarita was terrible. Even worse than the terrible margarita was when I mentioned it to the manager he did nothing to make me a happy customer, not even offer to take it off my check. That reflects very poor management and showing me that he evidently doesn't care if I return. I had taken a small drink and asked the person I was with to taste it also. I asked him to look at the margarita, taste it, but he wouldn't do either. Both of us (his customers) agree it was very bad.

I was a bit persistent with the manager just how bad it was.."the worst margarita I have ever had", I told him. The waiter when asked about the drink told the manager with a shrug that it was a "Happy Hour" margarita...does that mean they serve bad margaritas during Happy Hour?

A side note on this is that one member of the family does like this restaurant and dines there fairly regularly; it reminds her of her family outings (but she drinks wine not the margaritas). She had warned me that the margaritas were bad.. I am sorry I didn't listen to her. I mean, how can you mess up a margarita? She said, "I love there food but I order a glass of wine, they can't ruin that).

In one other visit, I did like the Buffet.

I am not returning. Also, I can't recommend this restaurant with poor management because poor management is unacceptable.

Yes. i am originally from texas. This place is very comparable to some of the best mexican restaurants in south texas. Very good food. Everything from the enchiladas, flautas, and caldo. Cheap and authentic. Can't beat that.</review>

(Translated by Google) Very good place to go to eat, have dinner whatever you say. Sometimes it is a bit crowded but nothing to see, it is obvious that if the place sells good food then it also has to have good customers.

Muy buen lugar para ir a comer, cenar lo q ustedes digan. Algunas veces esta un poco lleno pero nada q ver, es obvio q si el lugar vende buena comida pues también tiene que tener buena clientela.<//review>
