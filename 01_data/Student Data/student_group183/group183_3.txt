This is a cute little place with fantastic food. The omelet I had was made with all fresh ingredients and the fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious. The owner was very nice and even checked up on us. I would totally recommend as a great breakfast stop</review>

We have been in California for a week and this is the best place we have eaten. The staff is beyond friendly and gave our son a teddy bear. The breakfast burrito was delicious and they had quite a few different salsas that were a good mix of flavor and spice. A must have ever time we come here.< /review>

<Review>My husband and I wondered into K & A Cafe and were pleasantly surprised.  My husband got an California omelet with the sides.  It came with a beautiful avocado, toast and potatoes.  Way more food than he could eat.  I just ordered the omelette without the sides.  It was very hearty.  We ate outside in the shade and enjoyed the corner location.  The coffee was great too.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Menu looked exciting and the place had a cute hipster vibe. But the food wasn't great. Breakfast burritos were good, but the fruit salad was not. I didn't even know you could kill a fruit salad but smothering it all in cottage cheese will do the trick apparently. Got 2 smoothies, 1 was bomb and the other tasted very watered down. I'd give them another shot to make sure they weren't just having a bad day.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<date>1579465120278</date><text>We had a long weekend at the NAMM convention... Just needed to get away from all that..i Google searched for a great breakfast spot....K&A Cafe came up... Hopped an Uber... Not that far... Wow... The building and space are so amazing and homey at the same time... And then.. The food....a sausage bowl for him and egg breakfast for me... The sausage bowl had scrambled eggs, cheese, hashbrowns, and country gravy along with , wait for it, sausage!!! Yummy!!! The egg plate was basic, great, and exactly what i needed today... It is not a bank breaker, the prices are very reasonable. What i truly admire is the humans that staff the cafe, genuinely friendly and caring! NAMM happens once a year... We will be back...

<text>Amazing Breakfast!   We kinda bombarded them with our family while on vacation and they handled us like champs!   They very friendly and the owner came by to check on us regularly.  He really made us feel at home.  We had breakfast burritos, the California Omelette, and the Chiliquiles.  Their salsa is amazing.  You can't go wrong stopping by here for a great meal.  The coffee was very good too.   We will definitely be back on our next trip.< /text><name>molecularfix<//name><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Had the ultimate breakfast burrito and it had this creamy, soggy thing that gave the burrito a gross texture. Their "fresh" orange juice was bitter.

My coworker had their veggie sandwich and said it was dry and they used the tomatoes from their salad, square cut prices thrown between two pieces of bread, instead of sliced.<//review>

<review>Actually 4.5 🌟rating. They only use lose half a 🌟because they are not open on the weekends. BUT! They do have the best breakfast burrito, egg sandwich and Mexican breakfast for the price and it is family friendly. Family owned and get there before 2 because that's the time they close.< /review>< pictures>

We always have a pleasant experience at Children’s Braces & Dentistry, the best pediatric dentist! The staff is amazing, always smiling and personable. Dr. Surillo is trustworthy, honest and experienced. We have been beyond pleased with the work he has done on our children ranging from cleanings, cavities and braces. Our kids love going to the dentist thanks to Children’s Braces & Dentistry!< /Review>

<Date>1612674139836</Date><Review>We were referred to Children’s Braces & Dentistry by our trusted adult dentist which has been taking care of us for a few years before we had children. We are so grateful for this decision. Our son needed fillings and braces. My husbands family has a bad history of teeth. But this facility made it easy for our son. They talk to him about his personal responsibilities on his teeth in a way that we barely have to tell him anything extra regarding cleaning his retainer and flossing. Then they sealed my daughters teeth and she was all smiles afterwards.They made appointments and pay schedules easy. Everyone compliments my sons teeth now and we recommend this dentist for your children.</Review>< resp>

We love Dr Surrillo and all of the dental assistants and office staff! Everyone is warm and friendly and it never feels rushed. We especially like the time Dr Surrillo takes after each visit to explain how the children’s teeth are growing and any concerns there may be now or possibly in the future (braces). Both of my children have been coming here since they were very young and now both are teens. We are very happy with the great care our girls have been given including braces that were affordable and have created beautiful smiles! Thank you!<//review>

Our daughter has been with this dental office from the start of her first tooth until now at 13, she has always LOVED it here! She LOVES the staff: always professional, friendly and caring. She just got her braces off and her teeth are gorgeous! Thank you to Dr. Surillo and his amazing crew, for always providing her with comfort and great care...</review>

< Review>
Our son has a lot of anxiety when going to the dentist. Prior to visiting Dr. Surillo’s office, we had taken him to two others with no success. His experience this last week with Stephanie and Dr. Surillo was painless and extremely easy. No anxiety, no crying, no screaming, and my son did pretty well, too. In all seriousness, it was a great experience. I highly recommend this office for pediatric dentistry.<//Review>

<review>All three of my kids have gone through Children’s Braces & Dentistry from the time they had their first tooth through their teen years and up till now. Dr Surrillo and his staff have been excellent and met all my kids needs. We have been through braces, Invisalign, cleanings and all. Everything has always been excellent and my kids have been well taken care of. I highly recommend this office.< /review><Rating>5<//Rating><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Lacie Youtsey</Name><text>They are wonderful and so professional with young children here. My son has been 3 times and is always cared for and made to feel at ease during his visits. He comes in with some fear but it quickly dissipates once the dental assistant explains what they are doing and try and make it fun throughout his visit. His favorite part is picking a little toy at the end.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Time>

Dr. Surrillo and his dedicated staff are like family. They care about your child beyond their oral hygiene. We have been patients for at least 15 years and now that my children are adults it is hard to even consider leaving. So we haven’t.
Amazing office ladies make it such a pleasant environment. Highly recommend Children’s Braces and Dentistry.<//Text>

<Text>Came in for a second opinion on some dental work that our primary dentist recommended and were so impressed that we decided to switch over. We loved the instantly welcoming atmosphere and caring staff. Lots of happy smiles everywhere! Even though the office was quite busy, we never felt rushed through our appointment. Dr Surillo took time to answer all our questions and walk through the treatment options, and he handled my kid's apprehension about the mouth exam by modeling calm, like a pro, which helped my kid calm down faster. By the end of the visit my kid couldn't wait for his next visit.</Text>< gmapID>

<Review>Recommend by a friend. Staff and dentist are friendly and work well with kids. Was told at another dentist that my kid NEEDED 8 fillings. Was reassured by Dr Surillo that we can watch and wait, and that no fillings are NEEDED. (!!!) It's nice when people are honest and do a good job. I highly recommend this office!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I was referred to Children's Braces and Dentistry by another mom of children with sensory processing disabilities. The staff is welcoming, kind, and takes a genuine interest in their patients. Dr. Surillo is the same. I have been so happy with their care that, when my insurance changed and they were no longer in-network, I happily paid the difference. If you have children who struggle to go to the dentist due to sensory processing challenges, this is the dentist for you.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Everyone in the office made the process smooth, easy and were so patient. Dr Surillo is the best and always says things in a way that makes you feel like it isn’t the end of the world and that it was going to be ok.

My family has been going here for years! Both of my siblings have gone here for braces as well as myself, and they’ve done amazing! The staff at the front desk and scheduling desks are wonderful! The dental hygienists are so kind and very good at what they do! Dr. Surillo is the best! Definitely would recommend!</review>

I don't normally leave reviews online, however since everyone at this dental office was truly sincere and approacheable, I decided to share my thoughts about this office.

This office delivered exceptional care and service for my son while he was on a 2 year ortho treatment. My son absolutely loved every single visit because the staff members and dentist were so gentle and campassionate. The instructions (oral hygiene care at home) were easy and clear to understand for my son.

Another factor that makes this office so special is, they are flexible. For example,  as a parent,  finances can be challenging when deciding to move forward with treatment. However,  they are great at understanding your challeges and the care you need. In the end, they will work with you however they can to provide the necessary  treatment that you need to achieve optimal oral health care for your children.

Special thanks to the doctor and the office manager Cindy! Also,  many thanks to the assistants that worked on him!</Text>

We’ve been taking our 2 sons here for 5 years for their dental checkups and their braces and we couldn’t be happier. The staff is always so polite and professional, they give the kids great incentives, and will always work with you to find the best option for your insurance/financial needs. The waiting rooms have video games and they always take the kids back promptly. Never a bad experience. Highly recommend.< /text>

<review>This was my 3 yr old daughters first visit to the dentist and we had a great experience. The hygienist had her giggling the entire time and the doctor was just as awesome. We left with my daughter telling me all her favorite things about the dentist like having her teeth brushed with the blue toothpaste. I wish I loved going to the dentist that much! Such a great experience and the staff was all wonderful including front desk.<//review>< Pictures>

This part of the post is 2 years later…my youngest just got his braces off. Still so happy with the whole office. TBT my insurance changed years ago and I’ve chosen to stay and pay out of network prices because healthy teeth = a happier and healthier life…and my kids love taking care of their teeth because of the efforts and experience the whole office makes for kids (and adults alike)</review>< pictures>

My daughters love going to the dentist! The dental assistants are so friendly and enthusiastic, they remind me of Disney princesses in scrubs ;) The dentist is kind and gentle and always meets with me at the end to go over things and answer any questions. The office is decorated in fun kid-friendly themes with lots of colorful things to look at. Lots of flavor choices for the cleaning paste and fluoride, and the cleaning heads are in the shape of animals. My girls love the big selection of prizes to pick from when they are done. I am so glad my children have had such positive experiences at the dentist since this is the only place we've gone. Highly recommend!!!</text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Today was the second time I brought my son to Children’s Braces & Dentistry, and it was such a great experience.  My son is two and got his teeth cleaned for the first time! The dental assistant, Francis, was beyond amazing! She was so good with my son. She made him feel so comfortable! She was making him laugh and allowed him to pick his own flavors for the toothpaste and vitamins. I’m actually really surprised at how good the appointment went because I was sure that my son wouldn’t want anyone messing with his mouth. But it was such an easy experience and I know it’s because of the amazing people that work there. Can’t thank them enough for making this experience a great one and helping my son feel at home!

Our son Max is currently going through orthodontic care now and the office has always been so great explaining what they are going to do before even doing anything and have been so flexible when we needed to be seen because something came loss or didn't feel right.

My friend went with her child and was told that she needed unneeded filling but saw that was not case. Definitely is one of the best experiences I had he’s going to be our dentist for life.< /text>

<Review>We had an awesome experience. Last week my 2 year old went on a tour where they explained what would happen on an actual visit and let him choose a toothbrush and a prize at the end. Today was his first cleaning and exam. They were patient and friendly and explained everything to him at an age appropriate level. We are so glad to have had a good experience since this is where I went as a child and wanted to give them our business. Friendly and professional staff! :)</Review>< Pictures>

Dr. Surillo and his associates are always very friendly with the children, and make them feel comfortable.
Dr. Surillo also always makes sound decisions regarding the children's dental hygiene.
I also went to this dentist office as a kid, and am very satisfied with the service throughout the years as a kid and now as a parent.</text>

We love coming to Dr.Surillo’s office. The staff in the front and back are so friendly and accommodating! My daughter absolutely loves Frances and Stephanie in the back. They do a great job and clearly love kids. And Dr.Surillo has great chairside manner! My daughter feels very comfortable with him.<//Review>

<Text>I am just not sure I can say enough about this office!  EVERY staff member makes our time at the dentist AMAZING!  Did I just say that?  YES!  Isn't the dentist supposed to give you nightmares?  Not here.  They are friendly and communicative.  They are sure to inform me of all that is going on with my child as well as what my insurance may cover.  One of my children recently needed braces and they changed the schedule so it would cost us LESS!  They have the utmost integrity when dealing with dentistry and orthodontics.  I would HIGHLY recommend this office!  In fact, I want to me a kid again!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

My oldest son has been going to the dentist for 10 years and is still going there. My youngest son still go there for 7 years. They love being there. They are very comfortable with the staffs. The staffs kept me informed about what is going on with my sons's teeth.  They are awesome. Very colorful in the office for every seasonal and is clean. They have small area for video game and toys to play. The dentist doctors are wonderful.They are patients with my kids.</Review>

<Text>Dr. Surrillo and his team do an amazing job! He worked with my surgeon to complete 2 jaw surgeries, and I am so satisfied with the results of my smile! The payment plan is affordable, the equipment is modern, and every single person in the office is kind and personable. I cannot thank Dr. Surillo and his team enough for what they've done for me. Truly a transforming experience, leading me to HIGHLY recommend this office to anyone. You won't be disappointed!</Text>< rate>

<text>If I could give six stars I would. My daughter has been coming to Dr. Surillo and Dr. Whitcomb's office since she was in Kindergarten and our entire family has always been treated like family.  I want to adopt the entire office staff and my daughter loves every one of the dental assistants. Dr. Surillo is a professional who is great with parents and kids alike. My daughter just had her braces off today and the orthodontic experience we all had from beginning to end was not stressful for me as a parent nor was it difficult or awful for Emily. So many children  (and adults) fear going to the dentist.  My child looks forward to her checkups. Best...dentist's office...EVER!!!</text><Date>1483665643684< /Date>< response>

My daughter has seen Dr Surillo since she was young so in 5th grade when it was time for braces I felt very comfortable and confident in Dr Surillo and his staff that of course we agreed on his recommendation and her experience was nothing short of amazing. The staff always went above and beyond to make it a very comfortable process not only for my daughter but for me as well. Their welcoming smiles and friendly hellos added to an excellent experience. Thank you for her beautiful smile!!< /review>

Wonderful experience from the beginning!! Couldn't have asked for a better Dentist, Ortho & team to help maneuver thru braces with my Son. He never had a problem or pain & if he did it was immediately addressed and I was always seen that day!! Big thanks to Dr. Surillo & his team!!<//Text>

<review>Parents: This is the review you need to read before making a decision about where to have your child's dental and orthodontic care done.

I am now a twenty two year old who has been a patient of this office since I was a little kid. In fact, today I went in for one last cleaning before I go across the country for graduate school in August.

Like most of us probably remember feeling as children, the dentist or any doctor's office inexplicably felt like a scary place. Maybe this is the case for your children right now. It is important to find the right dentist/office for you and your family.

With that, this is my first Google Plus review and I am not all quite sure how I can put into words the amazing work, care, time, attention, passion, and love, yes, love, the fine doctors, dental assistants, and office staff put into their jobs at this office.

All of the individuals who work here have made my past twenty years of dental and orthodontic care memorable and personally rewarding.

I will do my best to list the specific high quality care that you can expect for your child and your entire family.

1. You are treated like family here. In my twenty or so years of coming here as a patient, I have grown up with this office community and they have left footprints on my life. The staff all makes an effort to get to know their patients as well as their families. All of the dental assistants and both Drs know how to work with children of all ages and apply an individual, personalized approach to meeting your child's specific needs as a patient.

For example, I came in to the office today greeted with hugs and hellos, questions about my sibling (who they've also known as a patient for years), my parents, my schooling and my life. This genuine, quality relationship is something I've experienced since I was little. They value the relationship with patient and family and work hard to keep you feeling like a member of their family. This is the same attention that has been given to me, my family, and other families for years.

2. Quality of care. I have received bi-yearly dental/oral care since I was a little child and during my teenage years I also received orthodontic care as well as other oral procedures (crowns, minor surgery, etc.) The diversity of care is met with a tremendous quality of care. Everything is professional, safe, handled with finesse.

3. COST. Yes, parents, I hear you. You find out that your child needs braces and you immediate feel a burn. No, not heart burn, but the burn of your wallet in anticipation.

No matter where you go for dental/orthodontic care, there will be costs involved. However, at this office there are dedicated and understanding staff that can work with you to find care that is affordable. As an adult looking back on the quality of care I received and my family paid for, it was entirely and absolutely worth it.

Finally, the strongest endorsement I can give my friends at Children's Braces and Dentistry is the fact that when I have my own family one day and I return home to La Mesa, I will be bringing them here. I, as a twenty two year old adult, would like to share the dental care I received from this office with my future family.

The truth of the matter is that they are already family, in a special way. Very few places can offer you and your family the comfort, security, warmth and loving feeling of stepping through the front door and feeling like you are at home.

Drs. Whitcomb & Surillo, as well as all of the talented and caring staff and dental assistants, have my very highest professional recommendation.

I hope to have you all join the family soon.</review><user_name>Arjan Jooyan< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I was so completely happy from start to finish!  Going to the dentist is usually known for bad service, unhelpful assistants, horrible work, unnecessary work and over-billing issues.  I have had the complete perfect experience from start to finish!  I was completely overly amazed on how polite and empathetic the staff and dental hygienists were to me and my 5 yr old son.
1.  The office was very nice and had little arcade games in the waiting room to entertain the little ones.
2. Loved the seasonal decor, felt like a warm welcome into a kindergarten class room, very nicely designed for children to make them feel safe and secure.
3. Every single person we interacted with was so helpful and actually more than willing to answer questions I had and answered questions I didn't know to ask.
4. The staff is experienced really knows how to talk and interact with children to make them comfortable and fun!  Yes!!  Fun!!
5. Their prices are fair and reasonable, as I had no dental insurance or dental plan so I had to pay out of pocket.
6. They REALLY, HONESTLY do not try to do more work than actually needed, then over bill you for it.  They actually SAVED me money and heartache!!  (Read on below).

My son broke off a part of his molar, after the x-rays they said had one cavity and needed a stainless steel crown and pulpotomy for the broken tooth.  I was scared and worried.  I research and investigated everything about crowns and alternatives, turns out, crowns are the best option, but still felt the need to discuss to the doctor about saving his tooth and doing a filling.  The hygienists gave me affirmation that Dr. Whitcomb always does what is best and is conservative by doing the least amount of work and only does what is absolutely needed.   Still apprehensive, I at least had that trust walking out of the office.

After my sons procedure they let me know they were able to save the broken molar and no steel crown or pulpotomy was needed just a good filling.  I literally wanted to cry I was so happy, I hugged and thanked everyone.  So that saved me $380 and most importantly my sons beautiful tooth!!!
This was my sons first dentist experience and not once was he scared, he actually liked it a lot!  I would recommend them to everyone young or mature and will continue to only go there from now on.  Dr. Witcomb is a marvelous accredited Dentist and does wonderful work! Again, thank you for your service in the Military Dr. Witcomb!

Thank you to all staff and Doctors at Children's Braces and Dentistry in La Mesa!<//Review>

<gmap_id>0x80d957233a319291:0xb1286fe659d13269< /gmap_id><review>I give -0- stars.  I had taken my child to this office 2x for exams.  When you 1st go there they have a "rule" sheet of what the parent will be expected to do.  1 of these items is to stay in the waiting room while they treat your child behind closed doors.  I have never allowed my child to be treated by any Dr behind closed doors.  Hello---do you know how many creeps wear Dr clothes?  Anyway, I put a note on the sheet that maybe in the future if I decide it is OK I will allow that but not right off the bat.  We had our 1st visit and no one mentioned my caveat or challenged it.  I thought maybe they understood some parents are for sure NOT gonna be ok with that and it wouldn't be a problem  Same experience 2nd visit & told us there is treatment that needs to be done.  Finally got the $$$ together to get his treatment and made appointment for it.  Waited a few weeks for the appointment.  Took my child out of school for the day and was told the appointment was scheduled for 1.5 hours.  We arrived at the appointment and the assistant takes us into the room with the door that closes.  She gets everything all set up and then in comes Dr. Surillo.  He says hello and then the assistant tells my child that I am gonna kiss him and go to the waiting room.  I said No, I will stand here out of the way, I don't leave.  Dr. Surillo told me he "usually" has parents wait outside so he can get the kids to respond just to him.  I said sure you "usually" do, but I made it clear on the forms my first visit that I don't do that.  He fought me so hard about leaving for about 5 minutes that I finally said, now I DON'T trust you because you are working so hard to get me to leave!  I asked my child if he was comfortable with me leaving because we had waited so long to get this treatment, if my child was OK we would stay but never come back.  The dr got up, took off his gloves and said he would not treat my child even if I wanted him to.  I was so mad at him, what an arrogant jerk!  Apparently he doesn't like anyone questioning his authority!  They told my son to get up, didn't rinse the topical anesthetic out of his mouth or anything, and ushered us out to the front.  I was shaking when I went to the front and asked to speak to the office manager.  She came out & pretty much tried to give me the same argument as the Dr.  & reached out to grab my arm to calm me down and I told her not to touch me!  It was apparent that nothing would be resolved so I asked for my refund and left.  I found another dentist and when I told them my story, they also couldn't believe that in 2013 any doctor would demand a parent leave their child alone in a closed room!  The new office we will go to leaves it up to the parent to decide if they want to leave or not.  I am grateful to them and hope it works.

Please understand I am not accusing him of anything inappropriate with my child.  I hope sharing my story can help save someone else my frustration.<//review><user>117456573956783711080<//user><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Time>1366238524785< /Time>< username>

So I came in this place yesterday because I've heard great things about it and that I'm buying a puff coat peak take it home charged it as the directions said turns out it did not charge or want to turn on so being super bummed out I noticed the receipt said they will return products within 48 hours so I came back from Palmdale to Simi Valley In hopes they were not gonna turn me away my prayers were answered they did not turn me away they said they would take care of me so I told them you know what let me just pay for the next one up that way you guys are making a sale as well he said that's awesome Hopefully the puff cupcake pro works and I don't have to go back to exchange but other than that I had a great experience thank you for your outstanding customer service and your great prices beautiful glass and you're knowledgeable smoking advice</review>

They're open later than most smoke shops in simi but if it's still early you'll save a bunch of money and get better quality by going literally anywhere else. It's like if Wish met an art gallery lol< /Review>

I went in for one item specifically but when I saw they had Randy's glass cleaner I got all excited and had to get some so the dude that was helping me gave me an awesome deal on multiple bottle - it was actually the cheapest I've ever bought the stuff for so that was rad too.</Review>< response>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>It's painful how cheap there glad is for the price. Granted they do have some nicer high end pieces, but every piece they sell under $300 can be purchased for under $100 in the right direction that sells direct from China. This company bulk buys most their stuff from China at Large enough quantities to print whatever label they want. Buy at your own peril.< /Text></record>

Good prices. I like it. Some of the glass is very thin so it brakes easy but that. Is when you pay for glass that is in the cheaper range. Pay a little more and the glass does start to thicken< /text>

This place is dope! The customer service here and employees are friendly and happy to assist, which definetly makes me happy to spend my money there. They will help you find anything that you need and do so in a timely manner. They have capes as well as many smoking devices for you to look at that are artistic and functional as well. A large selection and a friendly atmosphere, it's definetly a one stop shop.< /Review>

The guy working tonight was very rude and sarcastic. You shouldnt make people feel ashamed or judged for buying your products. When a customer asks if you carry a specific item it would be nice if you didnt roll your eyes and and talk down to them.<//Text>

the products that are not knock offs are alright, however, the knock offs and pieces they do have which are not on the higher end of the money spectrum are more or less proper garbage. i went and bought one of the lower priced oil pieces they have in stock, the glass nail provided with it only lasted roughly half an hour, and i woke up a few days later and there was a crack along the side of the piece itself. if you plan on going here, just be weary of what you purchase.</Text>

Bangers are 5.00$ ( A wide selection as well ) always kind staff behind the counter and they are willing to assist. & I admit im a difficult person to deal with in glass sales. (I'm picky). As far as Price, flaws, quality, artist. 👍<//Review>

< Review>
Staff is nice and all, but the quality of their products aren't too great. I recently purchased an electronic cigarette battery costing me $30. Two days go by and it already stops working. So today, I address the problem to the lady at the counter and the first thing she does is recommend $35-$40 dollar E-Cig batteries. I asked her if exchanges were possible due to me having a bad product and she told me "No, but I can sell you a better battery" Better battery for what? To enjoy the E-Cig for three more days life expectancy compared to the poor quality one that was recommended to me previously? No thanks.<//Review>

<rate>1</rate><review>Ordered a birthday cake two days ahead of the party. When I arrived on the party day and was told the cake was never done. Never called me ahead. Actually it took the store boy over 20 mins to contact the manager  over the phone to figure that out. Ruined my party without apologies.
this place is run by several high school boys, with the guidance from a legendary manager nobody ever met. These boys had to call the manager for everything, even how to place a customized order, or how to give a refund, which took forever for you to wait, then told you it's beyond their capability. hard to work with, only time wasted. Better go to somewhere else.Never come again.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

< Review>
If you’re looking for the Stranger Things Baskin Robbin Exclusive Funko Pop, DO NOT GO HERE!! The POP itself is 12.99 and they’re selling it for $40 with a limit to 1/person! Not only that, they sold the first person the pop at the price of 12.99 but changed the price at the register in front of everyone else that was waiting to $40. That’s ridiculous!

You’ll have a better chance of getting it at a cheaper price online.<//Review>

I just witnessed an unfortunate event.  I came in last night and employee "Brandon" (according to his badge) tried to take my order when he was abruptly stopped by "Evan" ( I'm guessing his supervisor)  in a very rude, harsh and unprofessional manner. He said " you! Clock out your gone" Brandon tried telling him he just wanted to take my order before he left and again this Evan guy stops him and says " No! I told you clock out and leave"!  His approach was so unprofessional as this whole thing unfolded in front of me, the customer, and unprofessional towards Brandon.  This type of behavior is not far from bullying in the workplace and worty of an official complaint to California employment and labor.  I hope this Evan guy get some kind of disciplinary action for his unprofessional manners.<//Text>

Place was filthy. The metal of the glass covering on the counter is filled with dirty liquid and moldy ice cream toppings, seemed  like they haven’t cleaned them for days. Also, came there to get the limited edition pop funko and no employee helped me. They were all helping out other customers who came before me. They told me to wait and I stood their for about 15 minutes until I left.</review>

< Review>
I’ve came here a couple times and finally remembered to leave a review. Overall it’s a neat and clean establishment. Located near the 5 and 22 freeway. Despite the fact that it’s a little hidden in the back, it still manages to get a good amount of customers daily. Would recommend if your in the area by 17th and Grand or if your just cruising down 17th. Based on my pictures I ordered some Dorilocos which were very tasty and they added some extra cueritos (pork rinds). Overall good customer service.< /Review>

Bad service the owner we know her since she first started she was always good to us it’s probably hot today that her customer service towards us was not good at all but every other customer coming in she treated even better wow it’s amazing how people change customers shouldn’t be dealing with this very disappointing and they never said thank you for coming WOW won’t be coming back< /Review>

This place is amazing and the service as well. Asked for double scoop and for the first scoop it looked like it was a double scoop. In the end I got a quadruple scoop for a double scoop. Highly recommend also because it has a variety of flavors.< /Text>

< Review>
This is my secret goto spot in China town. The prices are very reasonable and the dishes tastes great. Yes I know it looks a bit old and run down and the staff may seem blunt, but after you go a few times they will treat you like regulars and you'd get a very different experience. I always order my smooth egg beef ho fan and they're the best ones in all of China town here, trust me I am picky and I ordered the same dish at 5 different places.< /Review>

Great place to get snails and fresh fried Peking pork chops. Service is awesome. I've learned to take pics of what I like and point. As I typically come here when a friend from Chinatown takes me. Everything super fresh. You can call this the underground restaurant as it is.</Text>

<review>It's OK. The fried tofu was amazing, but the other dishes were less flavorful. Halfway through our dinner there was a horrible locker room sweat smell that was really off-putting. Probably won't come back.<//review><Time>1484794367385< /Time>< rating>

<rate>1<//rate><text>This is the worst restaurant I have ever seen. The place is very dirty and stinks. Especially, the lady at the front desk doesn’t know how to respect or talk to a customer. She talks in her own language which is very rude. Last but not the least, the manager just sits right there and does nothing even if his employees are not talking in a decent way with customers. Worst experience.<//text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
This is definitely your traditional mom and pop restaurant where the locals come. You get huge serving sizes and you're probably gonna feel like to have to do a mating ritual to get the server's attention on a busy night. Food is of very good quality, whether you get meat, veggies or seafood. Just don't expect to get top notch service.

This place is also hard to find. The street signage is very sparse and not eye catching compared to the rest of Chinatown. You gotta look for a narrow flight of stairs as the entry way. You can call this a hidden gem of sorts<//Review>

<Review>It's a old time basement dive restaurant in SF Chinatown on Washington St.
Mostly older local folks who patronize this place.
It's no frills, nothing fancy.
They do have some speciality dishes like saute snails in black bean sauce, fried trotters, etc., that other restaurants would not have.
But decent homey village style food. Family style restaurant if you just want a meal.
Not a place to bring your date to impress unless you're a foodie.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<review>$45 for either a crab or a lobster set meal, so it was definitely quite a bargain!  The lobster was fresh and it had great flavoring.  The set came with four other dishes:  East Lake Beef soup, Mongolia Beef, Spicy Salt Chicken Wings and Tofu with Veggies.  The soup and the tofu tasted good.  However, I find the beef and chicken wings a bit too salty for me.  It was a nice touch that they had complimentary red bean soup for dessert. The portion size was huge, but somehow, the four of us managed to finished everything! Definitely feels like a hole in the wall restaurant especially the fact that the restaurant is literally underground!  Credit cards are accepted.</review><UserId.>110717048034465456442<//UserId.><resp>None< /resp>< date>

The food was excellent and plentiful. 7pm Sunday evening and the place was rammed. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it's not exactly the cleanest place I've been in.</review>

<Review>Going into that place was a decision made out of hunger but once that was satisfied I realized this would have not been an option. Most food was okay but could be better. Dish tank had a couple dead fishes and it looks like the dust has accumulated for years. When we entered the cooks were taking a nap rigtr at the dining hall and so an old man that seems not to get bothered people going aroyar him sorry we had to make the waitress stake our order, we won't be back.</Review><Resp>None</Resp>< Date>

Food is absolutely delicious, and for a very decent price.  It's owned by the family.  There's a kid who's about 7-8 that hangs in there, and is super helpful and nice when we need help translation.  I'd recommend it to anyone.< /Review>

The service was terrible. The server was extremely rude. Also the kam Lok chow fun had almost no seasonings or sauce.
However, the meat was good.<//Text>

< Review>
can I give negative star? really bad service and rude, we went on a supper hot day in SF, about 103F. There is no ac in the restaurant and the waitress gave us a pot of hot-tea, we asked the old bald man at the counter for iced water, he showed his impatient face and walked away, after waited for several minute, he came with a tap water, no ice at all!  Fine, I forgave him.
When we were ready to order, we waved to him, he walked away and we have to call him again, he came with his fiery face, showing his impatient and frown.  That's it, I decided not to order and told him we're leaving because he was rude, we walked away, he was screaming something like "go, go don't come".  Really rude. I wish I took a picture of him to show it here with my review.< /Review>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Text>Never again will I go there because for the last time rude and how rude so rude the server acted like we were not worth the time. I have been going there for over 20 years and talking about this place as one of the true Asian food places. Too bad; rude, not clean, no access for the disabled, child labor, and the bad luck of acting like I was only there once. Do not waste  your time other great food places near.</Text>< Pictures>

<Time>1529812239419</Time><Text>(Translated by Google) The price is reasonable and even one person can enter. The taste is different from Japanese-style Chinese food, and it tastes like that. It's delicious, but the amount comes out as it is, so I think it's fun to go with multiple people. There is also a rotating table, so you can enjoy a fun atmosphere.

My cousin Martin was hit by a car a few weeks ago. The culprit didn’t even step out of his car and drove as if nothing has happened. We approached the Salmu Law firm for legal assistance. With the help of the expert car accident lawyer, we won the case and received monetary compensation.< /Review>

I was taking a stroll with my wife in the evening when a motorcyclist dashed into us. Fortunately, we did not suffer major injuries but it did affect our work lives and had to be hospitalized for few days. While we had to figure out all the formalities, seeking a legal help would be good is what we thought. I looked up online and got to know about Salmu Law Firm, APLC. Goodness they are so helpful to guide me with all the procedures. They have a systematic approach and everything was sorted well in time. Best service. Good Luck team.</Review>

<review>I actually was so happy that I thought of sharing it with others who are in search of Personal Injury Attorney. The assistance provided by Salmu Law Firm, APLC cannot be described in a few words. They guided me through the aftermath of a very horrific accident. Also, set me up with an appropriate Orthopedic group in El Cajon. One can say that they are quick responsive and committed through the entire process as personal injury attorney. This makes it a great law firm. I am highly impressed and would definitely recommend the firm to anyone who needs such a representation.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Scott helped me back in 2015 to deal with,  and get dismissed, an old charge I had pending that I did not previously know about. I contacted him recently to ask about getting documentation for that time and he sent it to me with no charge.  Scott was wonderful to deal with as was his staff. Thank you guys so much. Scott is your man.< /Review>

Salmu Law firm saved my sister from all the law and court tussles after she was facing domestic violence from her husband on a regular basis. She was really very scared when we approached her to know about the situation. I straight away called a friend who suggested me to call Salmu Law and I could not make any better decision. The lawyers were really skilled, experienced and helpful during the case. They made sure that the result was in our favor and their support was incredible. I would thank the team and tell them to keep up the good work!</Text>

It is not easy to go ahead with the legal procedures. There are so many things in law that can be confusing and overwhelming all at once. This is precisely why I am thankful that I was assisted by Salmu Law Firm, APLC. The attorney appointed to me was extremely considerate towards my case and patient with my queries. Extremely happy with their way of working and recommend it to anyone who are not sure if they should go with this one.<//Review>

Salmu Law has been really there for us when we needed them during the process when my husband met with a car accident. The situation was really tough for us as we were a family of two had no one to look after. As my husband was in the hospital, I could not give much time for the court proceedings and we were losing it. I contacted Salmu Law and was really relieved of stress. They helped us complete the court procedures in no time and we got the compensation which we deserved. I would really thank the lawyers for helping us! Keep up the good work!<//Review>

<Review>Cool haircuts two times in a row by different stylists, wait time is not too bad ~25-40 min for walk-ins. I liked how the queue is organized and shown in the screen so you have a rough idea about how long you need to wait. Staff is friendly and you can occasionally find discount if you are regular at the nearby Safeway behind the bills. Thanks Laila for the awesome haircut today. Currently the price is 17$/cut, and sometimes discounted rates are available on weekdays between 1 pm to 5 pm.
I tend to have bad haircuts often but this is a welcome change.< /Review></record>

<Review>Never again, second time, and again bad haircut for my son, he told me he did not wants to go to that place, way too short, crooked, cut his ear... I also got a haircut and mine was just fine, Sorry Great clips, but one bad bad job u get one bad review, one hundred good haircuts u get one good review.
Will not comeback even for free.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>I recently got a haircut for my daughter. As soon as she came out of the parlour she started crying seeing her hair. I told the stylist clearly just trim the hair, I don't need a boy cut. Even in between told her many times not to cut too short. (As my daughter is trying to grow her hair) She did not understand what I told. Even If I want I don't think my daughter would ever go back to that place again. Sorry this is the first time I am giving a very bad review and it because of my daughter's crying.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1555540505746, 'text': 'We’re sorry to see this, Meera.

After approximately 8 times visited, I have had a similar experience each time. I appreciate a hair cutting place that has consistency even when you have different hair dressers. I usually go for a trimmed comb over that I style messy. I have not had a complaint yet. I will be going again. My Wife also has had a few hair cuts here and all 3 times were positive experiences for her.<//Text>

< review>
I came here several times before and have received pretty good haircut and service. Today, I experienced such blatantly rude treatment to the point where I felt mortified.

They seemed busy and overwhelmed with 10 people on the waiting list displayed on the monitor at the front (people making appoints online). I waited till the hairdresser (first time seeing her there) to call me up and asked her how long my wait was. Although there were 10 names in front of me, she said she can cut my hair right away. Being confused, I nicely asked her again to double confirm. That's when she started raising her voice in short temper hurrying me to sit at her station. She started cutting my hair in a rudely hurried manner ignoring my direction. She was hurrying and pretty much bumping her electric razor to the back of my head. A minute into it, she walked away for a few minutes suddenly answering a call in the backroom. She then came out with saying a single word of apology or excuse. I was on the verge of walking out of the salon half way then. I suppressed my frustration and decided to wait till the end.

The hair cut was much shorter than I would have hoped. I was at the verge of refusing to pay and complain. However, I didn't want to embarrass myself by risking making this unpredictable and rude hairdresser lash out.

I will never come back to this place again. A terrible quality control and mgmt. This store needs to realize that most of their clients are local and repeat customers. They also need to train their employees to be able to communicate better in English. You don't need to be proficient at speaking fast. However, you must be able to listen to requests or at least have the patience/decency to clarify what you don't understand. My family will not be back here again. Horrifying.<//review>

<review>Came in for thinning out and under cut maintenance.  Usually when i get a thinning out feels like a weight is lifted off my shoulders literally but this time not at all. Still felt about the same amount of puff. More like a trim. Undercut was ok.  I have very thick hair and it is a pain to deal with. Might come back for a under cut maintenance but other then that probably not.😕🤔</review>< Response>

Excellent service. But make sure you go online and check-in to get in the queue before going there. Waits can be very long.</Review>

<Review>Sometimes I get good haircut, sometimes it's bad. Sometimes stylist are good, sometimes very very rude.

I've been going to this place for last 3 years now, once every 2 months. Overall I would say I got good haircut around 50% time. But my experience is getting worse & worse over last 4-5 visits. Today's visit culminated my frustration. Stylist was very rude, hurriedly finished my scissor cut is less than 4 minutes and overall finish was pathetic. Every time I thought let's take one more chance at this place but not anymore, I'm not finding it worth the price.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>The stylist was very nice. However, when I looked at my credit card bill I found that the gentlemen that checked me out added an extra tip that I didn't authorize. I tipped my daughter's stylist in cash for a reason. I'm very displeased.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>This had to have been the most "unpretentious" place I have ever eaten at in recent memory! I thought I had entered an auto repair facility but then I noticed some gentlemen sharing the evening Iftar meal. They beckoned me to a nearby table and the chef soon came and took my request. There was no menu, just suggestions of what he was offering this day.

Moments later, he returned with a heaping plate of macaroni, salad, chicken, and rice. It was so good and the price was so compelling that I left with an order of flank steak, macaroni, salad and rice for the following day’s Iftar dinner. Good food is wherever you find it!<//text>< Pictures>

I had grilled fish, rice and salad. It  cost 10$,  it tasted good and I didn't get sick. That's all I cared about.
There are no signes that shows where the place is located, they don't take credit cards and they don't have a menu. It's basic and cost efficient. Don't expect a fancy dinning experience for 10$. Take your food and leave.<//Text>

<date>1556325965634</date><name>Christie onion<//name><Resp>None</Resp><Review>I have seen better hole in the walls in tj... First thing you see when you walk in the door is everything falling apart. Very authentic? Run down, very unheigenic. I cook for a living and I wanted to immediately leave because of how disgusting it was...  2 tables, dark... Looks absolutely NOTHING like the photos. The temple is around the corner. And the ones of inside the restaurant are probably multiple years old. More of a hangout spot for local immigrants from Somolia than a family restaurant... I would not suggest bringing your family here. Seriously... The kitchen should be closed. If you go here, make sure you are up to date on your shots... :/<//Review><Rating>1< /Rating><userid>112806197853537419626< /userid></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5< /rating><text>We have spent a great deal of time at LAC+USC Medical Center, It is a facility equipped with State of the Art Medical apparatus with Excellent Personnel from Nurses, Doctors to support employees. We were Diagnosed, treated accurately and on our way to recovery. The hired security destroys the good image of the institution, the long waits along with the lack of parking facilities are characteristic of a saturated facility. My wife and I are grateful of the Medical and professional treatment we are receiving.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpjEU0a034m_Q009DAmAQuKG4cajxU0I78pp1M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMih-QdLB2nJXq3wNeZ1zO9xJ_qTjwkzID76v7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhJVVCmvGNQ1oFW6upIF_N2Y-dkND8xIZYNR1R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIPBt7Umm9LfHr999dS1bM5v9RIntYsBUwW24D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4q76dbOsiFZpJgn9PC_dEuY4_zuBQurFTI5tF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNq6X0TFWD74xohVGkFwA-SY5GzGWFAyiWjJPZG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmQ3RLhBjvJ3cR-9wCs6lgGg2QCjwi9FDj3j6F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEHCQcCJUBp6G1wXdzY116iDCoKcJvtJjlggBd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Went into Emergency with a perforated appendix(almost burst)midday on 11/6/19. The sense of urgency and professionalism from the get go was truly mind blowing throughout my suffering. From intake, young blonde gal with a heart of gold and altruistic drive to help everyone in emergency was astounding. Then went into the Surgical Observation Unit and the Nurse's Staff was caring and efficient as well. Shout out to "Bruce" for going the extra mile and escorting me to my car to get my cell phone to contact family and friends of my unexpected stay. The Team of Dr's(5 of them) All of them were polite, welcoming, professional and very considerate and genuinely concerned for my emergency situation. Dr. Kim's name (considering my situation) was the only one I could remember. Under the watchful eye of all the Dr's esp. Dr. Kim's expertise, they all gave me an amazing healing experience in a state of the art facility with ultra-sounds and many test and medication treatments to prevent me from having to go under the knife. This truly was the Rolls Royce of hospital experiences I've ever had personally or with family and friends over the years. I stayed four days(Left 11/9/19) and I am so Thankful to all the Staff & Medical Team for the Healing, Rest & Comfort throughout the Scary Situation of having Appendicitis. Eternally Greatful  to LAC+USC and ALL THE GREAT WORK, THEY DO!!!!

Entró en emergencia con un apéndice perforado (casi estallado) al mediodía del 6/11/19. La sensación de urgencia y profesionalismo desde el principio fue realmente alucinante durante todo mi sufrimiento. Desde el ingreso, la joven rubia con un corazón de oro y un impulso altruista para ayudar a todos en emergencias fue asombrosa. Luego entró en la Unidad de Observación Quirúrgica y el personal de enfermería también fue atento y eficiente. Grite a "Bruce" por hacer un esfuerzo adicional y acompañarme a mi automóvil para que mi celular se comunique con familiares y amigos de mi inesperada estadía. El equipo del Dr. (5 de ellos) Todos fueron educados, amables, profesionales y muy considerados y realmente preocupados por mi situación de emergencia. El nombre del Dr. Kim (considerando mi situación) era el único que podía recordar. Bajo la atenta mirada de todos los esp. Experiencia del Dr. Kim, todos me brindaron una increíble experiencia de curación en una instalación de vanguardia con ultrasonidos y muchos tratamientos de prueba y medicamentos para evitar que tenga que pasar por alto. Este fue realmente el Rolls Royce de las experiencias hospitalarias que he tenido personalmente o con familiares y amigos a lo largo de los años. Estuve cuatro días (a la izquierda el 9/11/19) y estoy muy agradecido con todo el personal y el equipo médico por la curación, el descanso y la comodidad en toda la situación aterradora de tener apendicitis. Eternamente Agradecidos con LAC + USC y TODO EL GRAN TRABAJO, ¡LO HACEN!</Review>< pictures>

<Review>i like this hospital, although it’s a coaching sanatorium I nevertheless pass there. I been a patient there in view that 2012. They have gotten noticeably higher. expecting an appointment is a undertaking however now days every medical institution is like that nearly. i love there because they've the whole thing you want proper there, you don’t should exit for other offerings. they've a whole lot of patients there that ought to inform you something approximately that health center. human beings’s from different clinics are coming there without or with insurance due to the fact they have the whole thing there. keep up the good work LAC/USC.💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜</Review>< pictures>

I was a recent patient at LAC-USC due to a mishap/accident (3/16/21 -4/2/21).   I severed my thumb off which made reattachment necessary (not successful).  Your nursing staff in the ICU, step down ICU and 6th floor ward performed extraordinary with my care.  Chestley, Caine, Nom, and especially Na-oom who was very attentive and positive, Bedley (a traveler) who was very inspirational and lastly Stephanie who handled my transfer to Kaiser without sparing any attention to detail.  It is rare that one finds a nursing staff that truly enjoys what they do and I was truly blessed to be taken care of by them. I commend them highly.<//Review><gmapID>0x80c2c675c228d697:0x6d6b23c9bb01f40</gmapID>< Rating>

Staff is professional, courteous and offer the best in medical care. Hands down, I refer people to go here all the time and boggles my brain on how sone are resistant and find themselves in a worse situation. USC medical team is the best in LA 💯</text>

I was extremely disappointed in the level of service and with the treatment that I received at this Health Care Facility. Most of the staff engage you as if you are less than human that they have something better to do than tend to your particular need. it also would appear although unconfirmed that your ethnicity has a lot to do with the expeditiousness as it relates to your service and treatment or of the service and treatment that you receive. I I'm appalled as an American that this attitude exist in an institution that my tax dollars pay for.</Review>

I love this hospital, even though it’s a teaching hospital I still go there. I been a patient there since 2012. They have gotten tremendously better. Waiting for an appointment is a challenge but now days every hospital is like that almost. I like there because they have everything you need right there, you don’t have to go out for other services. They have a lot of patients there that should tell you something about that hospital. People’s from other clinics are coming there with or without insurance because they have everything there. Keep up the good work LAC/USC.💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜<//Text>

My mom was brought to the ER because she was having a stroke. My dad and sister arrived at the same time and they wouldn’t let my father see my mom. They didn’t even give him any information of her condition. I called the number they provided us to call and we were told nothing. We don’t know if she is stable or what the cause  of her stroke was. It has been almost 24 hrs and we still don’t know anything on my mom condition. It is very stressful.<//text>

< Review>
The attending staffers are, for the most part, extremely kind and efficient, although unfortunately some pick and choose which patients they will see; and as it is a teaching school you may encounter residents who may have passed exams but have absolutely no people skills. As the covid pandemic has worsened some staffers seem overwhelmed; the rooms are so small that distancing is not possible; waits have lengthened and MDs don't seem to be able to keep up with phone visit scheduling; the "team" approach leaves me feeling as though none of the MDs on my assignment have fully read my chart, scans and surgery were recommended when I could have been receiving chemo, leading me to believe that the doctors care more about  recommending procedures than they do about community health, especially since I have a port that I need flushed and the only doctor to address the issue admitted that he knew nothing about it; quarantine protocols are lax and now I am wondering if I am even safe going in for chemo. Dr. Fancher inspired confidence, but three of the MDs I have dealt with came across as less qualified and diligent than the nursing staff at UC Davis where I began treatment, and far less compassionate than the "foreigners" and people of color on LAC+USC staff in supporting positions, who have been immensely kind despite the burden of the pandemic. Should I expect more from "county general"? I guess not. But if this is "America's Manifest Destiny ", who is your God? The healthcare industry in America reflects America's values overall, especially the degree to which deliberate disadvantage of certain communities hurts the country at large.<//Review>

I called today to make multiple appointments and after getting connected, the call went silent and I got disconnected. I called back and pressed the same numbers to get connected and it wouldn’t connect me to an operator. The message just kept repeating and repeating. I tried connecting to the pharmacy and patient services and nothing. I’m just trying to make appointments before September. Is there any other phone number to call?<//review>

<review>Went to ER on August 8th after leaving kaiser ER  18 hours before. (2051 marengo st. Los Angeles ) left on august 9th.

I don’t have insurance and kaiser took me and prescribed medicine after examining me for 3 min tops. I didn’t feel very comfortable the way they functioned and the lack of explanation.

My symptoms worsen so I decided to go to LACUSC emergency. This is where everything turned into blessings.
The moment I arrive I was hesitant because it didn’t look as nice as kaiser. But once I was greeted and checked in that’s when I started to see that they are passionate Individuals that truly care about what they do. From checking in I had to meet with a nurse to give them my symptoms and background for visit and I have to tell you i had a great time doing this while we joked around and get the job done. They make you feel welcome and taken care of. They do their job with happiness and positivity. Once they put me in a room another nurse (Jessica or jasmine I think) took care of me to prep me for the doctors. (Yes 2 doctors were there to take care of me) nurse also had a very good sense of humor and compassionate for their patience and treats you like a special individual. Once the doctors came in dr patal and another doctor (she was in and out and wasn’t able to get here name ). Both of them spent at least 30 min with me to diagnose and to find the problem of my symptoms. Dr. Patal took over till the end and came in to visit during the 9 hours I was admitted. Truly professional, amazing doctors and nurses. It’s 5 pm now after being released at 11 am and I knew I had to find a way to write this and I hope it gets to them. I wanted to do more than just this and will find a way to show my gratitude. I feel a lot better and I was in so much pain 10/10 for the past 5 days and just continuesly rising each day. They were able to fix me with in 16 hours up to 70 percent good to go. Now I can get up and do not have to lay in bed all day. For the team at this ER! I have never seen a group of people that works so happy with each other and for others !

But it gets better
When I asked for my bill they said all I have to cover was the medicine I need to purchase and pay for. I wasn’t sure if they knew that I didn’t have insurance and didn’t want to walk out not paying especially after the amazing work they did. So I went to ask again at the cashier and they sent me to the patient Finacial service and Monica the person that was there was soooo helpful and was able to get me insurance for the rest of the year. I never asked her to do this and she offered it to me and said I might be able to get it.

Over all I had PPO and was with kaiser for 6 years until I lost my insurance membership.i will certainly choose to go back to this hospital even with the PPO insurance. I used to pay 450$ a month for insurance and I would love to spend it towards this hospital!

Thank you so much too everyone that made me feel so much better and cured my health problem ! I Will always be thankful of your existence!< /review><resp>None< /resp>< Date>

During the Covid 19 pandemic LAC-USC Nurses in general have been very accommodating to the families of patients, especially Nurse Eilene in 4-C -118 nursing station. Due to these changes Nurse Eilene gave us updates since we couldn't have contact, no visitors and limited communication... however it is dissappointing when a Nurse (Eddie at the same nurses station) tells you, "I don't have that patient on my assigned roster," yet when I asked if he could transfer (after being transferred to 3 other nursing stations & people) he says, "Oh, I do have him.  He was just given to me right this moment, but A l'm very busy right now, I'll call you later..." That's absolutely sad and unacceptable when you can't be there and your family member is fighting through a possible Multiple Leukemia  Cancer diagnosis. I hope this Nurse Eddie does not ever have a loved one under similar circumstances because it's heartbreaking to feel helpless with nurses like him with no bedside manner and compassion. How he got to be a nurse is beside me...I hope his mother never gets this kind of treatment.</text>

< Review>
Worsted care I have ever had. 4 to 6 week wait on referrals. Referral for Orthopedics. Was kick back and told to Primary and talk to re-issue a referral for occupational therapy. Without even being seen by an orthopedic. For a fractured hand, that had just come out of a cast. My other referral I was left hanging.  told that it was 4 to 6 weeks and I’m County you know. Not worth the drive for the lack of service I got for my medical issues. Call to file a complaint some guy named Freddie was supposed to call me back that day three days later I have yet to receive a call from him.<//Review>

A couple days ago my water broke at 28 weeks and I had to be admitted to labor and delivery. I was so scared and worried I couldn't control myself or my emotions... once I was admitted I met the most wonderful and caring nurses named Donna, Julia, and Larry! They helped me so much and calmed me even more, it was like having family there and I am so thankful for them and their kindness, they went above and beyond for me!</Review>

<review>I had an amazing experience at the ER. I was there for 5 hours but overall the experience was great. Staff is so attentive. I understood there were people in there for more serious conditions than me so I was patient about that. Thank you so much nurses,doctors and literally everyone working there.< /review><time>1560120528189<//time></record>

<text>I always stood away from this place because of all the horror stories (from the previous hospital) but I guess I was just affiliating them.

My 4 y/o is nonverbal and autistic, and was suffering from an eye problem for over a week. I took him to his pediatrician and then to the CHLA ER (where we had the WORSE experience) and we were told nothing was wrong. I decided to bring him to LAC+USCs' ER because his eye was just getting redder and irritated by the minute. I did not know they had an ER just for Pediatrics!! They attended us quickly, maybe we went on a good day, who knows.

The entire staff here are just Fantastic!! From the nurses to the Doctors - I cannot express how much they understood and cared for my son. They made everything so easy and really helped with their thorough explanation of procedure and honesty. They even brought in a Eye Specialist in no time and finally (third times a charm) he was the one who was able to see what was wrong with my sons eye and gave us the best possible care.

To Dr. Katheria & the other awesome attending Dr (don't remember his name) - THANK YOU!!! You'll never know how much I appreciate your care. We need more patient, caring, understanding, and loving Doctors like both of you. If in the future we need more care, we will be coming back to you.</text><name>Daisy Gonzalez<//name></record></dataset><record>

I was in the ER for almost 3/12 hours before my name was called back again and sat in the back for 2 hours. I was told one thing by one doctor & another thing when i got to the back . A nurse told me it may take a few hours to the exam  I needed & that they might need to move my room. Overall i left without final determination by doctors of getting my results after 3 1/2 hours i was over it and left . Holistic practices is where I’m turning to no one helped me find out what was wrong. I hate this place !</Review>

Unless you have a bloody body, do not go there.  Unless you are brought in by an ambulance or a helicopter,  you won't be seen for 12 hours.  Yes 12 hours!   They prioritize who should be seen first.  If you still persist, then bring pillows and blanket to spend the night there.  The worst time to go there is in the evening.

You'll see how poor America is and how the poor is treated like a nobody when you go there.  Even if you have billions of dollars, you'll be treated like a poor person there.  It's like going to Walmart or 99 Cent store.  No one will think you have the money.

Remember real life hospitals are no Grey's Anatomy.  Even the hospital on Grey's Anatomy is private.  If you have insurance, try a private hospital.  Your insurance should cover emergency room services anywhere.  Go to Kaiser on Sunset and Vermont which will get you out in less than 3 hours.</Text><gmap_id>0x80c2c675c228d697:0x6d6b23c9bb01f40</gmap_id>< name>

<Review>This hospital is average and it’s really huge so I recommend you to come 30 minutes early if you have any appointments. When I came here for emergency room waiting alone took more than 6 hours and the workers didn’t really help which was the most frustrating part.<//Review>< Rating>

This is by far the best hospital and I will never go anywhere else for care. In particular I recommend their emergency department if you have a critical injury or serious health concern. I love the availability of specialists they have and their excellent quality with the level of concern for patients. I had a miscarriage about a month ago and recently sustained a very severe burn on my hand. Each time I felt well taken care of and like I was receiving the best care available. Also, four years ago I had my son at this this hospital and that was an amazing experience as well. If I have more children I well definitely be returning to birth them at at LAC + USC.<//Text>

<Text>I have to thank the ER evening team. After 14 hours of locked jaw after a dental office visit, multiple dentists and oral surgeons trying to force my jaw back into place, the ER team at LAC-USC was the only successful team to help me and get my jaw back into place. The staff was super polite and tentative from the front desk to the nurses and doctors. They kept me informed at all times and were most gracious in their care. They certainly knew what to do. If you want the right care, definitely go to LAC-USC, very skilled staff.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I've received great care here, the ICU, the emergency services... Fantastic people. Excellent doctors and nurses... Decent employees. Only reason I did not rate 5 stars is there is always room to improve.< /Review>

<Review>Worst Hospital I’ve Ever Been Too. The Fact That I Had To Have My First Child There Makes Me Even Sadder.. I Didn’t Get The Attention Care & Knowledge I Should’ve Experienced... They Dropped My Placenta On The Floor After I Told Them I Wanted It To Stay Connected With The Baby So He Can Get All The Nutritions... The First Room They Put Me In Was Horrible My Fiancé Had To Ask For A Different One.. I Had To Get Induced & They Kept Having The (Student Who Was Supposed To Be Observing & Learning) Stick His Fingers In Me & He Didn’t Even Know What He Was Doing ! I Had To tell Them I Am Not A Experiment This Is My First Child Im Already Scared So No Offense But I Need Seasoned Doctors Not Trainees Practicing On Me smh They Were All Rude Barley Smiled. Didn’t Bathe My Son Didn’t Do Tell Me How To Breastfeed Didn’t Ask If I Wanted My baby Picture Taken Nothing ! I Feel Like i was Robbed Of What Was Supposed To Be The Best Day Of My Life .... They Get No Stars From Me !< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I have read many of the reviews here about  LACUSCMC!  People, remember this, this is Probably one of or THE BEST Teaching hospitals in the NATION!  The Staff do as much as they can in the time they are able to!  The Nurses, doctors therapists,  administration are ALL very caring patient people!  I think all of the hospital do CARE A LOT!  Maybe they get frustrated because time runs and waits for nobody. These PROS are in it to HELP ALL PEOPLE!  QUIT COMPLAINING AND thank a Doctor or Nurse today!  They enjoy what they do -  but maybe get a bit overwhelmed when there are a lot of sick people that need to be seen!  I have found that a vast majority of the staff have been working there for their entire life, that speaks VOLUMES! IF you cannot be a patient. W/ patience then go someplace else! BUT, YOU won't receive as professional and as loving care as you would here!  They really do care!  💗so just bring something to read or do because it does take TIME.  At LACUSCMC, you will have a team of docs that all are on your side!!  Thanks for reading ! 💗<//Text>< pictures>

LAC+USC Medical Center saved my life.  I know that our future doctors and nurses were the ones who assisted me.  I know that I was a hand full, and first time experience with a patient  with uncontrollable szidures, due to a hyper-sensitivity to an MS treatment. I understand that at one point i had to be strapped down, i apologize to some of the nurses. However, thanks again for your assistance.< /Text>

<Review>Service is fine, but dealing with billing or any sort of administrative processes is hell. Seriously do not go here. Their billing department gives you different information every time you call, its practically impossible to update your address if you move, and they won’t re-send a bill if it went to the wrong address or was misplaced. They also won’t refer you to any outside practitioner if you want to move your business elsewhere, so you’ll have to start over.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Summary of that Day: Sunday, April 14, 2019

On the very first day of my visit and on two separate incidents on the same Sunday of 04/14/2019 a nurse whom never identified herself conducted herself in an unprofessional, uncompassionate, undignified and gross manner.

In the 1st incident on or about 10:00 am PST on Sunday, 04/14/2019, I was in the LAC+USC, Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit, C4C, 2051 Marengo Street, Los Angeles CA.  I was a visitor in the room.  I had previously that morning requested and received permission to embrace the patient, who was on life-support.  When, suddenly and without warning a person stormed into the room and pulled open the sliding door with much force and violently drew open the curtain - so that the end of the curtain fish hooked onto the wall.  This person never identified herself.  With a raised voice she said, "You are not allowed to have the curtains closed!", "Are you his sister?!", "You're pretty.".  I never responded, as I was too grief-struck visiting my little brother on life-support and as he is nearing death.

2nd incident on or about 6:00 pm PST, on the same Sunday of 04/14/2019, the same nurse whom never identified herself to me became uncontrollably irate. As she said, "You do not snap your fingers at me!!!", "You do not rush me!!!", simultaneously growling and walking away as I must walk behind her with her back to my face - nodding her head "No!", on the way back to my little-brother's bedside/room.  It was unclear to me as to why she was furious, since I ring the doorbell to notify the ICU of my presence and allow me re-entrance to the ICU.  I was then threatened with forced removal via USC Hospital Security. I was told Hospital Security would arrive and remove me from the premises. "Security!" was screamed repeatedly into the telephone receiver.  I waited for "Security". I stood there shivering as a new nurse presented herself and said she was/is "Security", falsely.  Why do you think the real and authentic USC Hospital Security-Guard was not called, is it because of no real threat?  I did not use a curse word, kick a trash can or as much as drop a paperclip to the floor while being threatened with removal.

I said, "I will not be here long, my brother is dying"; I was too drained to cry.  I had lost all my will and could barely utter those words as my heart was shattering with internal tremors that felt like the Earth was relentlessly shaking under my feet, my little brother was almost gone.
Olimpo Rosas Jaramillo, my brother died on Good-Friday 04/19/19 with me and family by his bedside.

*I was later told her name Kimberly Bertha Suarez, RN<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Came to the ER for my daughter, luckily no one was in the waiting room really so we got a room right away. The nurse & Dr. were so very nice & the medical care was great. Since this is a county hospital you may have to wait due to trauma cases coming in so don't complain about the wait if you are not in a life or death situation. Dr. Quesada is awesome!!!</review>

<Rating>3</Rating><Review>I had two staff conduct the most painful, uncomfortable opthamologist eye exam. Comparable to San Francisco's Mark Zuckerburg SF General Hospital actually. Then - they called an expert, who arrived and was much better, methodical, hardly any pain, endurable and humane. Compassionate. Please teach your colleagues AND be rewarded. More thoughtful caring people like you should exist.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>Hands down the best hospital ever. I had my prenatal care there for my daughter my midwife always went above and beyond for me. Not to mention the delivery it was an amazing experience. Clean room all to myself and family. When it was time to push specialist we're in the room on stand by and my daughter never left the room they did absolutely everything in the room. I wish I can give it 10 stars.<//text></record>

Their was an older female Asian security guard at the main entrance that was giving me a hard time despite the fact I didn't do anything wrong. It's obvious she doesn't like Latinos and this needs the attention of her superiors.< /Review>

An ambulance too me the ccrt team was nice to me but I was self harming and they put me in a room with other teenagers that was okay but the point is you dont get privacy when you wear the gowns on your body in the morning they say keep the door slightly cracked like you dont get that much privacy even they said you have to keep the door slightly cracked when you go to the bathroom and they asked me repeatedly like are you okay and it just was making me angry in my head and I didnt get to sleep in a actual bed I was sleeping on a leather blue garden chair they dont even give you pillows to sleep on for your head at night the food there some were okay the pizza was good fries were disgusting crunchy bland taste they had a cookie that was alright the juice the eggs were hard as stone I put it in my mouth and I refused to eat the nurses are like literally saying if you dont eat the food their going to keep you at that place longer if your put on a 72 hour watch for self harm cutting if you dont eat their food they have to keep you there longer so just try your best to eat their disgusting bland food.<//Review>

All the hospitals in LA have a population of homeless which I understand but they most definitely have NO SENSE of URGENCY!! Staff is incompetent and hired straight from the street. You can tell and they act like it. customer service? You’ll never find it. They speak rude and act like they don’t have any control . AND IM NOT ON MEDICAL!

One of the Nurses saved my husbands life Friday night 11-18-2016 on I-10. My husband can not remember his name, due to the condition he was in. If you see this he wanted to thank you! He just got out of the hospital today. If it wasn't for you I wouldn't have a husband and my kids wouldn't have a dad. Thank you very much!< /Review>

< review>
ATTENTION MOMS, DADS, EVERYONE THINKING OF GOING TO THIS HOSPITAL ! IF YOU CAN AVOID IT, AVOID IT ! I took my son to this hospital in February of last year due to an RSV infection. Once I was there they started running tests on him that were completely unrelated. Eye tests ? Multiple blood draws with no information as to what they were looking for, and the list goes on. Then, out of nowhere I'm told that the staff was suspicious of child abuse. I took my son in for a respiratory infection and I'm told they think I'm beating him ? Literally. I was also told I'm being *put on watch because of my young age*, really ? Then, the staff ordered an ultrasound of his head and a ct scan of his brain. Nothing came back. Obviously. And they kicked us out. No apologies, nothing. Just acted like they did nothing wrong. Also, while I was there I signed a form saying that I DID NOT CONSENT TO VACCINES. My oldest son suffered seizures after his and I didnt want to risk having my youngest go through that. This started an argument with the charge nurse along with another nurse but I stood my ground. The next morning I had to leave early to pick my other kids up and when I came back he had bandaids on his thighs along with bloody gauze in his crib. I asked the nurse what had happened and she said it was probably from a blood draw but that they had just done rotation and would have to go through the chart. Never got back to me. No matter how many times I asked I never got an answer. Fast forward. I put in a request for all of his medical records from the week long stay at LAC and they refused to comply. My son ended up needing to see a nerologist and gastrologist after this. They both requested the records and were refused service. I contacted insurance over and over and was refused billing. I filed grievance after grievance and nothing. SIX MONTHS LATER I WAS ABLE TO PICK UP THE MEDICAL REPORT.  And you can guess it, all bs. Lie after lie, contradicting information. You name it. Not only that but the paperwork said that they had given him multiple vaccines AGAINST MY CONSENT when I had left the hospital. The bandaids weren't from blood draws but vaccines. I filed more grievances. And continued to request the billing and nothing. It's been a year and I still dont have answers as to what else happend to my son while at that hospital. He has medical issues and I have no answers. Spare yourself the horror, spare your child. Please.</review>

I will state that I have never been there myself, but I've heard a lot of really bad things in the media. This includes a 60 Minutes essay about something they called "patient dumping".

They showed camera footage of poor people being taken to skid row hotels, if they had no more funding. It also had interviews with those patients .Many  patients stated the lack of care and long waiting times.

But again, I have never been there myself. But I trust the reliability of 60 Minutes.<//text>

My grandma was referred to Urgent Care for a Glaucoma Evaluation because the pressure on her right eye was extremely high. As our first time here, we understand it’s a process for paper work to be filled and demographics & insurance information to be put in the computer. However the staff is so rude and show no compassion towards people. (I say staff because all the ladies in the front are gossiping, eating and being on their). My grandma is a 95 year old disabled woman, who can’t see, hear, and can’t even walk on her own. With our guidance my grandma is only able to move around. The lady who attended us, was inpatient when my grandma had to sign, she spoke to us with an attitude, her tone of voice was unprofessional and her body language of eyes rolling and head moving was unacceptable. I don’t come here to argue but I don’t understand how there are people in the wrong positions. So sad to see staff who has lost the hospitals values and mission.<//Review>

I also came back here years later when I started having seizures and getting my treatment here helped me get approved for Social Security without needing to pay money for a lawyer.  The new buildings are really nice.  The medical records from this hospital are the best you can get.  The doctors here are excellent.  The only reason why it does not get 5 stars is because of the very long wait when you go to the Emergency Room or when you have to see a doctor, and the other problem I have is that they left the temporary ICU filter inside me after they woke me up from my coma.  That can kill me later in my life.</review>< gmapID>

County USC is the hospital to come to, if you are looking to die. The hospital has substandard rude nurses and doctors. Waiting times are long.  Administration does nothing about complaints. It's another Killer King Hospital. Where are you Hilda Solis?<//review>

<text>I recently had a visit to ER and the service I got was excellent.  However, in the follow up that I had to do to get two appointments set on the phone, I got referred to at least five different numbers. On the last call, I was told by the operator that I needed to speak to my doctor about the appointment.  When I told her that I had been in Emergency and was following up on the discharge papers I got, she seemed at a loss on what to do.  At that point I hung up. I am aware of the number of patients that this hospital handles but as the issue I am trying to handle is cardiac related I am concerned at the lack of priority given to this matter.<//text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
The good, the bad, and the ugly of USC LA County Hospital.  This is the only hospital where you can see an orthopedic surgeon on your first trip to the emergency room.  If you break a bone and don't want to wait weeks for a referral to see a specialist this is your hospital.  You could quite possibly get a walking cast right away if your break isn't that bad.  However if it is something non-life threatening like a broken bone, expect long waits from 12 to 24 hours.  If it is a true life or death emergency they will rush you right in.  The doctor's, nurses and everyone there are very skilled and caring.  The problem is that there are a 100 people waiting to be seen at all times.  A lot of them are poor and homeless.  The waiting room smells and sometimes it seems like you could get lost forever in it.   Some people do get lost during a shift change for a couple of hours.  However, it is a small price to pay for excellent quality health care, even for those that are uninsured.<//Review>

Contrary to everyone else, my mother received great care here. From the moment we walked into the ER, the triage staff assessed her diabetic urgency and she was given immediate care. The RN, nurses & ER doctor were very attentive....I have nothing but great comments about this visit. Triage is the most crucial process in any health care facility - its to prioritize emergencies & this hospital is EXTREMELY busy! Everyone who visits any ER has a different experience.</text>

Was here yesterday and didn't get out for 14hours!!!!  14hours!!!!!!!! My eye was in so much pain and they didn't care even after i told them my pains was at 10. I had to wait so long for each next step. I check in at 11am and didn't get it until 2:20 am!!! So many personnel and they get upset when you ask if you are next or how long it's gonna take. They don't give you piece of mind. I had never wrote ANY bad review ever and I've some other bad experiences but this tops it. So frustrated I even started crying to myself. I never made a fuss out loud because that's not me. I had to hold it in. Never come to this emergency room. My parents even had to come and ask. You really need to be DYING for them to see you a reasonable amount of time.</text>

This hospital is a hit and miss.. There's really helpful, caring and competent nurses and staff and then there are LAZY people with attitudes who cut corners and get away with it. This place really needs a management overhaul. At least some units do.< /Review>

My wife was passed around from Huntington memorial to Alhambra hospital where there is no doctor in ICU. Nobody could figure what was wrong with her. At Alhambra I signed her out took her straight to LACUSC 6 hours later spinal meningitus with septic Shock! Said 5 more hours she would have died. They saved my wife's life!<//Text>

So I will cut then a break but wow, they make you wait long.</review>< name>

<Text>I am trying to make an appointment for my refills. I drove all the way to Los Angeles thru LA morning traffic. They told me that they sent my prescription to my pharmacy and drove back to El Monte, just to find out they didn’t. My pharmacy told me the hospital needed me to make an appointment, which I am trying to do for the last 2.5 hours and still waiting. This is ridiculous. I would even wait in the DMV because I would at least been seen.</Text></record>

Radiology has worsen service and looks like it keeps getting worst. First of why do ultrasounds with no picture film! No precious memories of baby ! Oh but if u ask for them u need to file a paper copy wait another 1-2hrs plus ! Like ppl have nothing else to do. Second making appointments to radiology is crazy nd be sure to get a paper print when making your app because ive come twise for and app. And i was not given right time or date. Then waiting time to schedule is over a month ! So if you have something serious ull probably dye before u get to know wth it is.😠</review>

A lot of people go there, sometimes you wait forever but it has been a good hospital over the years. Not perfect but provides a helpful service to the community. thankful for the service.</Review>

< Review>
Stuck in the E. R.  3 DAYS misdiagnosed to shame and fear...

1. Even if you deserve them,  this hospital will dump you for asking for any opiates. Even if you didn't know that the medication you asked for was one.

2. bounced around the many fast tracks,  set up like a homeless shelter with security island.

3. Nurses and Doctors jaded,  Nurses will begrudgingly rewrite your doctor's diagnoses just cause they are mad at ALL the patients,  basically they will fail to mention you have lung cancer.

Update: I found out from another area hospital that I had NO Frequent Flyer flags given to me on my electronic record yet LAC+USC acted like I did . Presumptuous Mind Games .<//Review>

I was here almost 5 years ago because of my mom and out of every nurse we had only one stood my mine and my brothers side her name is Asilin I belive. She would comfort me and my brother, although we were young she helped me see hope even though she couldn't make it. I plan to go back some day and thank her in person because if it weren't for her i don't think I would have had those great last days with my mom. Hopefully she's still there,  but besides that some may be rude and they can take hours to take in their patients. It's a huge hospital with most of the rooms occupied so it's understandable. .</text>

At the beginning I was doubtful of this place, I am in the emergency unit of the hospital and in the inside it looks grey and dark, not appealing colors for a hospital, there is obviously a homeless problem since I'm basically surrounded by them. But they were fast in helping my girlfriend and there's wifi for me to pass the time. So it's ok. The parking could be better though.< /Text>

<text>The ER, been here 5 hrs, there's a woman right here right now, passed on the ground and I belive she should be seen, she's been here before I was. Oddly enough the order of people actually being seen are in the following one person every 45 minutes. So explain to me how one woman hasn't been helped and is still on the ground? Oh and the restrooms..... disgusting... but that's just the ER.....

Time now is 5:46 PM
We just got the news we have to wait 3-4 hrs for X-rays</text>< pics>

I had an appointment and waited for 4 hours total in the hospital because they needed to update patients’ information every months or something. and what they told me was you can’t see a doctor.< /text>

<Review>Literally kicked out of ER room while throwing up and unstable. The doctors are very caring. Nurses not so much as they were very unapproachable. Only 2 nurses working on the west wing and they are very overworked! I've never seen so many waiting rooms for a hospital. Lol, what an experience... one i never hope to repeat.<//Review><userid>113912844617405158614</userid></record>

I was gonna apply for medical insurance so I go to this trailer I forgot what number was but the lady was really nice and told me that the trailer I was in it's for finalizing steps to get my medical insurance and that I need to go to the other trailer #17 to apply for medical insurance she gave me the directions and smile very nice lady, So I went to trailer #17 and I go to this rude lady I wish I got her name she is overweight dark skin,long black hair and has glasses,brown eyes/hispanic. I tell her that I want to apply for medical she ask me if I was patient I say yes thinking I gonna apply for medical because I didn't understand what she meant from patient since In the sign said APPLY FOR MEDICAL so I just said yes then she ask me for my Insurance I'm like (ummm in my mind I have no insurance that's why I'm here lol...) I told her I didn't bring my expired insurance which I explain why mine is expired and that I have no insurance and she is like ok give me your ID I give it to her and she is like it's this card from here?...its not from United States, and my ID is from Puerto Rico and I say yes it's from here,and she is like you have green card??? I tell her you know Puerto Rico is part of the United States,right? She looked at me clueless and confused and then she start being really rude after that and just told me here it's not to apply for medical it's for patients from their hospital to go there I'm like what? And she is like gave me paper fast from the districts that I need to go to apply for medical and then, I told her the lady from the other trailer tell me that I can app- and she didn't even let me finish my sentence she is like,who told you that?! I was like wow and then I am just like ok well I guess I'm going this districts,she didn't even tell me bye or anything she is like stand up from her chair and talk to her manager or I don't know who it was but it looked kinda whispering to me and she was looking me in a weird way and I just left. Very disrespectful woman I don't know who hire her but I'm pretty sure the recruiter needs to check on the people who hires.< /text>

Let me just say im glad i came to this hospital. Delivered my precious little girl yesterday. Even though she was coming in early at 31 weeks 4days the nurses reassured me everything was going to be okay. My RN Dann L.  Wow he just walked me through everything and made me feel very comfortable. If you ever get a chance to be his patient he truely one of the best! Very nice staff excellent care. Over all my experience here was wonderful. Thank you so much! You made me feel like we were all a big family just supporting one another.</Text>

<review>My mom passed away in this hospital in a weird way a pain in her leg turn into something deadly they out her to sleep and never open her eyes again 😞 how is that even possible they call me early in the morning telling that she need blood I ask the doctor if she was ok he said yes but she was still sleep one hour later my sister called me that the doctors told her that my mom won't open her eyes anymore and that she would stop breathing at 5pm they knew the time already now the doctors said it was a stroke that her brain was dead 80% ok so they telling me in one hour they did all this test? No no no something wrong is here I been in the hospital and when they check your brain it takes time for someone to come and pick u up the rest takes 45 minutes so they telling me they did all that in one hour? No 👎🏼 please if you have your mother or anyone in the hospital make sure you ask what meds she getting and write the name of the nurses doctors 😒 this nurse is somewhere making more mistake only god knows if she had done this to other people</review><Rate>1< /Rate><resp>None< /resp>< Pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Bad Service, specially at the womens clinic, I have medical insuance problems, they help me get a temporary one for now they have you going up and down the building. Im 24 weeks and 5 days I only have had ONE ultrasound from them (from what my pregnant friends told me i should have had more than one ultrasound specially if im 5 months). my appointment was cancelled last week then i received another paper through mail saying i will be seen, i went for my appointment (NO ultrasound) i was scheduled an ultrasound appt on Monday the 22nd and they cancelled it due to my " primary dr. not working with their network"  why would they give me a doctor who doesnt work with radiology?. Half the people there dont know what their doing, theyre just a bunch of students experimenting on you. im  glad i changed my clinic, i expect to have BETTER service there!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>Terrible. Their website is misleading and their staff opts to lie instead of say " don't know" or actually work and find the answer.

I Went to their dental clinic on this  malicious misinformation to find they don't have low cost care for  all low income patience but only patience that are on public assistance with government subsidized insurance.

They're turn you away in pain. There is no low cost flat rate 80 buck clinic, they don't check income,or expense and there is no " ability to pay program".

Infact staff  first said they charge 1000 for a basis visit IF your insurance hmo/ppo. The financial Nazi kept telling me, without calling to verify, that my private insurance was hmo when it's private. He was lazy,presumptive and lies for convenience.

Wasted my day. Walk in clinic malarkey. Low cost sham.

Big scam misrepresentation.< /Review>< pics>

The emergency rooms are horrible, but during my stay, I was in the H building since I had undergone surgery for a pituitary gland. I stayed there for 6 days and all of the staff was helpful. If anyone needs help with going through a pituitary gland surgery, feel free to reach out to me. (Hablo espanol tambien).<//text>

The main doctor wanted to give me a stitch. They were understaffed, so he went to a different department. The new doctor didn't even look at the file/x-ray & just decided to use super glue. The cut is healing deformed.</Review>

The emergency  room was fine, but the next 7 days all they did was try to treat my pain. I became infected and my collapsed lung worsened. Luckily my insurance group had me transferred to Huntington Memorial hospital where I was given antibiotics and they put a catheder in through my  back to drain my lung cavity. I  still had to have surgery to irrigate my lung cavity because of blood clots and infection. I feel I spent an extra week  in the hospital because at USC they didn't properly treat my symptoms. Hopefully I never go back to USC< /Text>

<review>HORRIBLE. I spent 12 hours here with my boyfriend. They are so unprofessional. I will say that the doctor that saw my boyfriend was extremely helpful and there was a lady who kept me updated. I'm an African American woman. I hate to say it but with the exception of a few, a lot of the blacks and mexicans were not acting professional. The whites and Asians that I came across were professional, super helpful, and informative. The lady that checked us in was ghetto to the max!!!! My boyfriend wass sitting in front of her in so much pain and she was just dancing and playing fake football with the security guard. WTH!!!!!  I pray that I never have to go to that place again. I was there from 7pm to 7:30am. Get insurance, it's not worth it.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Dr. Babaii is a horrible person.  So are her supervisors.  She would rather let a patient die than admit she was wrong about her diagnosis or the kind of medication she prescribed.  The administration was the same way.  Luckily, the pharmacy caught it first. But if Dr. Babaii had just listened to the patient and the family it didn't have to happen.  Dr. Babaii kept saying, "I'm the doctor!  I'm the doctor!"  Horrible, horrible person.  And a really bad doctor.  Beware!<//text>

Where do i begin? Well some employees in charge of physciatric ward are very unprofesional and insensitive to the condition in which people are in while there. They are on their phone constantly , profanity is used by some here and there when situations get frustrating for them. Some of the medical personnel arent really living up to the oath they took and probably are just there because they were placed there. One african american staff lady was disrespectful to a patient the patient asked her a question of something to the effect of "how do i get off this bed" she replied and i quote " the same way you got your ass on is the same way you get off!".
I get it some times people get frustrated no one is perfect but some of these patients do not know what they are doing hence why they are there. Some staff does not belong in that medical profession.<//text>

I came last week and it was the first time I went to hospital in US since I am an international student here. I came there with my wife because she is pregnant my first child and she has no insurance. So at that time I had no idea how everything would work. It was thurday afternoon, and at the front desk i was told that it would need 8 hours to wait in line, so i was suggested to come again on saturday morning. And it was true, i came again on Saturday morning, and we didnt have to wait for long line. And it was a great experience. Everyone was great and nice. The administration, the nurse, the doctor, security, everyone. Since my wife has hyperthyroid, she got a lot of examination by the doctors, Fraser and Velazque, and the nurse, Lupita. They are very professional and caring. Yeah... We had to wait for the doctor several hours in examination room, but I didnt need to complain since the doctor had to help other patient. I am sure they work very hard to serve a lot of patients there.  And what made me feel so lucky to come here is that they offered me medical that can cover my wife. Keep the great work LACUSC!</Review>

<Text>Excellent Services, of course if you go to emergency you will have to wait a lot, cause the priority of your emergency, i know people who has wait for more than 3 days on emergency, but believe it or not i had better service on this hospital, than DOWNEY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER, (and this other one is a private hospital), L.A. COUNTY HOSPITAL make sure you are ok before you go home even if you have not money to pay they help you find a program to pay later, PRIVATE HOSPITALS LET YOU DIE IF YOU HAVE NOT MONEY OR INSURENCE</Text>< Rate>

Horrible Dental dept. (except the one who took my bf dental consultation today)... They hadnt responded to appoximately 3msg left on there msg syst.in a span of almost 30+ DAYS-in regards to booking an appointment even though bf had a refferal. Some of there Dental staff were condescending and dismissive of my bf situation... Just not right !

E/R AND TRIAGE WERE GREAT AND HANDLE MY BF SITUATION SERIOUSLY and were in disbelief of there fellow dept. Actions...

2nd Dentist my bf saw blamed on miscommunication...smh

If it was someone with $$$ there little to very little room for error from late oct-december.

Thank you for atleast ER&Triage-(thanks nurse sandy) depts being respectful!!!<//text>

I've been to the ER many times and have never had an experience that made me swear off a hospital before this. The ER is staffed with disorganized, inexperienced young residents, with no oversight from an experienced Dr. There was no nurse assigned to my room. The residents failed to diagnose severe soft tissue injuries throughout my neck and back, and forgot to order a CT scan for two hours after doing their initial tests.

Resident Jennifer Farrah treated me in a dehumanizing and spiteful way after I asked how long she thought I'd be there. It had been almost 7 hrs and I'd be walking home alone, I didnt want to walk home late. She took my question as a challenge and yelled at me in front of patients and staff, called me selfish, and treated me in a dehumanizing and spiteful way the rest of my time there.

Of my question about the wait she shouted, "Some people were in car accidents and need help!" In no way was she behaving like a health care provider or Dr who can be trusted around vulnerable people. If she'd had been working any other job she'd have been fired on the spot.

I asked for food (hadnt eaten in 12 hours, again there was no nurse.) She acted like it was a trick, and refused me food. She lied and said someone comes around with trays. I had to ask the desk staff she'd just yelled at me in front of, and someone grabbed me a bagged sandwich from a cabinet that was easily accessible the whole time.

She yelled at me when I asked to be discharged. I was tired and in pain, and didnt want to be released late at night to walk home alone (my phone was dead at this point and no bus goes directly to my house.) She said If I dont wait for the CT scan I could die, which went against what she'd just said about my case being low priority. It had been 7 hrs at this point. She made me vacate my room while she got my papers. She took an hour and I had nowhere to sit but a used stretcher in the hall.

She didnt go over my discharge papers with me. A very young desk staffer brought them over with no explanation. Diagnosis: "car accident." No record of tests they'd done, a blank next to referral Dr. Most pages were generic printouts of clip art about "what to expect after a car accident." The last page was to sign, saying a Dr had explained the papers and I understood the information. I pointed all this out and the guy laughed at how badly her work done but said "I dont know anything about it, if you have questions the Dr can answer them." She yelled at me again, blaming the lack of information on me "refusing" a CT scan.

Being under out of state insurance, my follow up care was only covered if referred through the ER. She said there's nothing to refer me for since I'd they didnt do a CT scan, regardless of my other pain and the tests they did. When I said I needed a referral she lied and said a Dr would call me. Again, that isnt how it works, she was lying so I'd leave (yet wanted me to stay? A spiteful control freak who should be fired.)

I'd signed up to have my medical records available for download and those forms are completely different than my printouts. Jennifer Farrah's name was off it completely, replaced with the name of someone who wasn't there at all. The only info was my vital signs. It's useless for my medical history or to get further care.

I had to miss work the next day, take the bus to an urgent care place, and pay out of pocket for treatment my insurance would have covered. The Dr at Hollywood Urgent Care is also an ER doctor and said the order the residents did things was confusing, didn't see how they could have missed my back injuries, and expressed shock that I was able to get to his office at all because they were so bad. Diagnosis: severe soft tissue injuries throughout neck and back. Treatment: Rx's, advice on returning to work, referred for chiropractic care. All paid out of pocket though my insurance would have covered them at the ER.

The chiropractor also confirmed the severity of my injuries, put me in neck and back braces, and expressed concern that this hadnt been done at USC.<//text>

<Text>I have waited 5 months to see a neuro surgeon with a refer from the san fernando Valley Olive view hospital. Never got to see him. Also I was told to go to the ER General Hospital and I'd see a doctor quicker and then I can get an appointment to see the neuro surgeon. After 15 hours in the ER waiting I still didn't see the doctor. They took my blood pressure ever 4 hours. I went home in serious pain. After going back to my general practitioner the doctor added on a new illness and told me to have General Hospital Drs. to call his clinic. Like, have your people call my people bull mess. I'm going vegan and I'll take my chances with Yoga, stretching, acupuncture cupping, massages and meditation. Still in lot's of pain though. to add insult to my injury I am on hold as I type to General Hospital to file a complaint. SMDH. If you go, take breakfast lunch and dinner for two days. Watch out for the suspects too.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2c675c228d697:0x6d6b23c9bb01f40< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

But it really can't be helped, considering how many patients they see per day. This is where everyone goes who can't afford to go anywhere else. This place is huge ànd there àre people everywhere.The Phàrmacy is àt least à 4 hour wait, that's after you hàve waited at least an hour in line to drop off your prescription. From the time you get there and wait to go through security, to wait in line for financial clearance, to waiting in the clinic to be registered, to wait for the nurse to call you back, wait for the doctor to see you, wait to get your return appt, wait at the pharmacy....well, you understand, it's a waiting màrathon and usually takes all day. I am sure improvements could be made to reduce at least some of the wait. For instance, kudos to another LACounty facility, Martin Luther King Jr medical center. They now have a system in place that greatly reduces the wait time at their pharmacy. Co USC would do well to adopt it. Granted, MLK is crowded, but they don't have the volume of patients that Co USC does.Still, I think it would be good if they used MLK's system. Having said all that, I have received competent, professional, compassionate and respectful care whenever I have come to Co USC and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<text>The hospital itself is great..the doctors and nurses inside the hospital are great but when it comes to trying to book an appt its crappy..call back service is crappy..some of the staff act like they dont want to help..they take your name and number down say they will call back and they donot call u back..some of the people that work there need to really get it together..< /text>< pictures>

<Text>I wish I could give this hospital 0 stars.
My mom stayed there for 3 days.
The staff hardly checked up on her, they didn't give her all of her prescription meds and just all around bad experience for my mom. She looked, sounded and said she felt worse while she was there than before we took her.
Just horrible.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Takes about 2 -3 hours even after you made an appointment. Nurses, PA, seemed like they do not know anything about lab test results. Every time, different nurses, PA saying different things and asking to have more tests done, without solid answers!!!<//review>

< review>
I don't appreciate the fact that I had to wait an hour even though I had an appointment. When I finally went in, I was only with the doctor for like two minutes. When I got the bill, they charged me thousands of dollars just to look at my broken jaw and tell me that I was not ready for an extraction. Very dissapointed< /review>

Please realize the people being served by LAC+USC. While many complain of long waits and rude people, if you have a stomach ache or heartburn, across the ER is an URGENT care. $60 and you won't wait... that long.<//text>

My girlfriend recently had surgery and I was told by one of the nurses she can receive visits. Drove a whole hour and a half just to be told I can’t visit my girlfriend. Because of a mistake the nurse made. They was not feeding her, the nurses was rude and I WILL not ever go or tell someone to go here< /review>

(Translated by Google) The general is one of the worst. They didn't cure my son, they kind of killed me. Bad experience, only students are not doctors. Therapies are the worst, no attention. Doctors don't listen to the choice of one. They treat patients very badly. They don't look at what you have, they just want to stick a knife.

(Original)
El general es unos de los peores. A mí hijo no lo curaron, como que me lo mataron. Mala experiencia, puros estudiantes no son doctores. Las terapias son lo peor no ay atencion. Los médicos no escuchan la opción de un. Tratan a los pacientes muy mal. No miran lo que tienes tú no más quieren meter cuchillo.</Text>

<Response>None</Response><text>(Translated by Google) I had a very good experience with the birth of my son in this hospital, despite the fact that if you do not speak English very well it will be a bit complicated with the doctors, but nothing to worry about because they understand a little Spanish.
It is a research hospital, so rest assured that they will not do many tests until you are sure of what you have, the first-rate staff and facilities are a dream.

(Original)
Tuve una muy buena experiencia con el nacimiento de mi hijo en este hospital, a pesar de que si no hablas muy bien inglés será un poco complicado con los doctores, pero nada de preocuparse porque entienden un poco español.
Es un hospital de investigadores, así que ten por seguro que t harán muchísimas pruebas hasta estar seguro de lo que tienes, el personal de primera y las instalaciones son un sueño.</text><Time>1498713690727<//Time><Rating>5<//Rating>< Gmap_id>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The best medical service I have ever received. My mother is hospitalized here and I am 100% satisfied with the care they are giving her.
It is the best hospital in the area. They have the best doctors and the best medical equipment. The nurses are so loving.
It is surrounded by basic stores such as a 7eleven, fast food restaurants, cafeteria, toy store, mini market among others.
They sell fresh food all day around the hospital.

<review>(Translated by Google) They treated me very well when they operated on my spine.
They put me in an individual room, as if I were in a paid Hospital; From the Orthopedics to the nurses, they treated me very well; and the operation was a success Thank God; There were 3 discs that operated on me and 2 of them rebuilt, and they have never hurt. This operation was done to me 8 years ago.

(Translated by Google) I am one of the people who know how to thank and in this country, thank God, I have medical attention at no cost and if I have to pay, it is not much, but how can I put on my bows and say that it took me, well, it is not true I say in my country that it is Mexico I am dying and they do not even attend to me if I do not pay because they have medical attention and they give you medicines and everything for free and to start saying things other than being in a country that does not belong to you. 🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️😉 is my umilde opinion is the hospital is very good and everything has changed and changed for the better 😁
