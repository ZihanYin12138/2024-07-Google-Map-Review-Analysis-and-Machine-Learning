Since the day i came to check out this public storage facility the people working here have been so helpful and have gone above and beyond to make sure i was getting what i wanted and asked for. They didn’t have the unit size i needed and they made sure to accommodate me and i could not be happier with the service i received. I would definitely go through this business again if i need the storage unit. THANK YOU!</text>

I’ve had a storage unit at this property for over five years. It’s always been good, but recently I needed to move across the country in a tight timeline. Destiny helped solve some technical issues with my unit (since it was so old) 3 days in a row. One night I came in with movers and the gate code on my account wasn’t working. Destiny came down after hours and quickly fixed the issue and saved my move. Highly recommend this Public Storage. Amazing staff! Thank you Destiny!<//review>

In order to show me the possible storage units, the staff made a special trip into the store. They were kind and gracious and left me with the feeling that the units are well guarded and looked after.</Review>

This one was my first stop. I need storage! Never used storage before! Staff is very welcoming and knowledgeable, Unfortunately they did not have what I needed but Destiny S. was amazing in looking at other locations  for me and even called them to let them know I am on my way. This grants for 10 stars for customer service!!!!!! Thank You for going above and beyond</Text>

I would like to take the time out of my day to commend one of the staff members here that helped me. I believe her name is Destiny she was so helpful knew just what I needed as far as what to suggest to start with the move and what to buy to properly store my personal belongings all the way down to what size storage unit I needed. She knows her way around the property and was very helpful on explaining what everything was as needed she has a positive attitude, a very respectful demeanor as well as great customer service. Thank you so much Destiny for making me feel like I belong there and will continue being a customer.</text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I have nothing but positive things to say about this storage unit because of the amazing district manager, Farz. I was stuck in a sticky situation because I not only lost my keys, but the office on site was under construction. I was majorly stressing out about getting my stuff out in time for the next billing cycle, but when I luckily was able to get ahold of the district manager she took care of all my concerns within hours. Amazing response and great customer service! This could have been a very bad customer service situation and Farz completely took care of me. I will definitely continue to use public storage for my future needs.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

We were in need of a temporary storage space and found this location near us via Google search.  We met Jennifer in the office who was extremely helpful, courteous, and patient as she guided us through the process of deciding how much space we needed.  She gave us a tour of spaces that were available and we were able to quickly determine the best option for us and reserve it.  She also gave us all the necessary information (some of which we would not have thought of) and signed us up.  We thank her very much.</Review>

Just secured storage for our upcoming move. The sign up process was easy. Previewed the space, bought some key packing supplies for the move, and was completely satisfied with the process. Taslima was very helpful, and knowledgeable. Excellent experience.

We just moved to the central coast and moved all of our belongings from our Public Storage unit. The staff at this location, Destiny and Jennifer, have been very helpful, and great to work with. Checking out of our unit was quick and easy.</Text>

I let her know my situation and she was able to even get me a more suitable storage. She also reminded me that I didn't get my mattress cover, which she had... thank you Jesus.  Also cant forget the quick and painless paperwork. Public storage needs more of a fantastic person like destiny<//Review>< pictures>

My unit got broken into and most of my electronics / valuables were stolen.  It wasn't just my unit, there were other units that got broken into where they cut our locks.  Amazingly they only have security cameras on the front entrance but none on the units themselves, so there's really nothing that can be done.  Right now I'm waiting to get some compensation for my rent.  I'd advise going somewhere else until this place gets its security updated.</Text>

I was very impressed with this storage facility. Unfortunately renting a storage wasn't a happy thing for me, but the service helped make it a little easier to handle. The staff is highly knowledgeable and very kind. I dealt only with James. He knew all the answers to my questions and mentioned a bunch I didn't even think to ask about. He was very understanding and was sympathetic to my situation. It definitely makes it easier to deal with a situation when you have good people to rely on. I know my possessions will be safe under the care here. If I have to do this again I will make sure I come back here. This place is amazing...and it didn't break the bank, even for a pretty big unit. I hope the big guys know what great staff they have here! I recommend you choose this location if you can. It is right off the freeway making moves easier and the staff will help you smile even through the worst. Thanks to them for all the help!< /Review>

Excellent facility. Clean and secure. James, the property manager, was really helpful ahead of time by allowing me to store two Door-to-Door storage containers at the property for a couple days to unload them. Other storage companies wouldn't allow that. He got me a unit right by the elevator so it was very easy to get in and out. He explained all the details of the rental clearly. This facility has really easy access off of 101 so it's pretty hard to beat!</review>

Public storage needs more like destiny, the moment my sister and I walked in, We were greeted with a very warm welcome and what ended up being a very quick and simple rental. Keep up the good work... 2 thumbs waaayyy up<//review>

<Review>I recently rented a space at the 1909 Old Middlefield Public Storage for 1.5 months. I highly recommend this location. I really got I paid for -- everything about the operation felt thought out and professional.

The access gates work perfectly; you get your car in and out of the lot without worrying about getting sandwiched! The large carts make it easy to transport many items at once. The elevators pause for a minute on opening and closing to give you plenty of time to wheel your cart in and out. And every time I was there, the outside and inside of the facility was tidy. I remember once hearing a brief brushing sound down my hall and it was James, the manager, on one of his walkthroughs, doing a quick sweep.

Another great thing about this location is the trees hanging over the parking spots. My car stayed cool.

More about James -- on first meeting, without me asking he described the safety of the facility (no transactions permitted on site; local police expect the facility to be quiet and it gets their attention when it isn’t).

Not only is James on top of everything, he is warm and funny.

One tip. If you are storing clothes you want to hang, you can buy a "wardrobe box" at the office and it is well worth spending a couple of extra bucks to get the large size one. It was a big help.</Review><date>1464747153623</date>< user>

<Review>James is great. I stored stuff in a couple of units (downgraded once because I needed less space) and everything has been so easy.
I was looking for storage about a year ago and totally overwhelmed by options, and James was so friendly and knowledgeable and made my moving in so easy!
Space is clean and perfectly fine; I don't have much to compare it to but felt completely secure leaving my stuff here for the better part of a year.
I now have a larger apartment and no longer need storage,  but I highly recommend this place to all!</Review>< Pics>

This was my first time renting a storage unit.  It was simple to sign up and the charges were explained clearly.  The facility is convenient and easy to access.  I met both James and Peggy.  They were very helpful and friendly.  All in all this was a satisfactory experience.  I am hopeful that the monthly rates will not be raised too soon or too significantly.</Text>

<Review>Had a great experience! James was very helpful and friendly, He asked for details about what I was going to store in order to suggest the best pick. He also took the time to explain in details the lease agreement and everything! It was my first time dealing with Public Storage and I'm very satisfied! I definitely recommend this place!< /Review><userid>103847400078062737778< /userid>< rating>

Both charges are perfectly reasonable but I didn't realize until I was already there with a friend and partway through filling up paperwork.

Staff (James) was very proficient, helpful + quick. He explained everything well and didn't waste time getting me set up.</Text>< Pictures>

Moving is never fun, but getting a storage unit was easy and stress free thanks to the help from the manager James. I am pregnant, and had a touch of "pregnancy brain" and even though I was a little lost in the situation, he calmly helped me out and got me the unit I needed with a nice discount from the deal they were having at the time. He even gave me a couple pumpkin cookies! Major bonus points coming from a pregnant lady hahaha!
It's right off the freeway, with easy access and in a safe gated area. I highly recommend this place!< /review>

<Review>I was really surprised at how accommodating this place was. James made sure that I got the best rate on my unit. When I wanted to downsize the next month, he helped me get the best rate for the amount of stuff I had. Any little problem I had getting my stuff in, like trouble using the lock, or help with the dolly, he was johnny on the spot.

<Review>We have had a storage unit here for a long time and recently needed a bigger unit. James (the manager) talked to us and said he would call us when the new unit was open, it took just a few weeks and it was available. He managed to get us twice as much room for even less that we were paying before. I highly recommend this storage facility.< /Review>< userid>

<text>Must say Destiny was such a sweetheart! Great person and just love renting with her . My dad has a space here and is up in age and can’t do much but manages . He brought it to my attention that every time he come she’s will come outside and help open his storage unit since he can’t do so himself . He is very thankful and so am I . Great employee public storage should be honored to have you !<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I only needed short term lease and James was wonderful in accommodating my needs and he was procedural in explaining paper work to me. I'm also impressed with how he kept the grounds clean. I will always recommend, public storage 1909 middlefield, to my friends and others.
Thanks so much, James, for your professionalism!
Happy customer< /Text>

I have a good experience with this location. The manager was present at the appointment time to check in and was friendly. He showed me where my storage was and the keys to my storage (you don't need to bring your own lock). The storage is temperature controlled. Accessing the facility requires individual-specific entry code, after inputing which your vehicle can go closer to the storage building. Then there are 2 carts to help with moving stuffs from vehicle to the storage. Overall, a nice experience.<//text>

The date on my credit card expired not long ago.  I got a phone call from James informing me that I needed to update their records to avoid a late payment fee.  James stayed on the phone with me while I went online and took care of it.  Great job!  Thanks for going above and beyond.</Review>

This public storage facility has a very experienced and responsible manager. The whole move-in process is smooth and effortless. I would definitely recommend the place!

My mattress grows spots of mold during the one month in Public Storage and I may need to throw it away. Clearly the protection in the storage unit is not perfect...< /review>

When I called to make the reservation, the GM Umut recommended that I reserve the unit for 1 month instead of 2 weeks so that I can use the $1 first month promotion. This suggestion saved me $100! The place is well managed and Umut has been really helpful. I would definitely recommend this place.<//Review>< Pics>

Despite it being well after office hours, James, the manager was kind enough to unlock and give me my door code. It's this kind of service, above and beyond the simple duties proscribed by our arrangement that make this Public Storage manager superior to all others.<//Text>< pictures>

I went not knowing what size storage space I would need.  Peggy was very helpful and worked with me to find a space that would fit all my stuff.  The space I reserved was not able to hold everything I had brought.  Peggy said no problem, showed me several several other options and quickly had me moved in.</Review>

Awesome French restaurant. Their menu is just great, lots of variety. Their onion soup is super tasty, so are the mussels with fries. Their wine menu is great, they have Chablis. They also have daily specials. Prices are high but worth the portions and taste. Venue is super nice, cozy, like an authentic French bistro. Reservations are encouraged. A must in Fresno

A little pricey for what you get,  but there is a large range of memberships available.  You're likely to find something to fit your budget and playing preferences.  Great staff inside, and an interesting track.  Tight fairways,  lots of trees, but receptive greens.  Only one kooky hole.< /text>

<review>I worked a charity event there yesterday and it is a very beautiful place. People are friendly, golf course is kept nice and clean. You can see the gorgeous homes that sit on the hill. I didn't meet any employees of the club, but the members are nice and friendly.<//review>< rating>

Course was in amazing shape.  Greens were fast and challenging.  You not have to be a big hitter to score low.  Accuracy and course knowledge will lead to low scores.<//text>

< Review>
Helpful friendly staff. Excellent facilities.
The course is challenging in the respect thwart it has narrow fairways and very mature trees (a LOT of them). Accuracy is a 'must have' here.
Fairways are Bermuda Grass which is now dormant.</Review>

Great round of golf for $35. Fairways and greens in excellent condition. Staff are very friendly and bar is a great place to unwind after the round. Highly recommended!<//review>

Pretty disappointing.  Greens were horrible and the layout of the course is pretty bad. Customer service was good though. That's why they got 3 stars.</text>

< Review>
Most overrated course in Fresno. I think because of their proximity to San Joaquin country club they believe their course is also a must -play course. The course has too many strange holes, too many weird doglegs, and they charge what. I am used to paying ay resort courses. I used to play there during twilight fees but we could never finish 18. There are too many nice courses in the valley to spend my money at their overrated municipal course.<//Review>

Stopped in for some beer and wine, and enjoy the band playing. It was crowded, but found a table in the back  Service was great! We had a menu with in minutes. After 10 minutes, we moved to a table up front. People were friendly, store was clean, and the atmosphere was perfect. Been there a handful of times now, and always enjoy it.< /text>

<Review>Great location in the cute downtown Brentwood area. The tables on the sidewalk make for nice people watching. I like the wine selections, especially the Bone Shaker red. The wine flights are a good choice for the undecided. The cracker/nut/cheese/dry fruit/meat platter is the perfect amount of food and pairs nicely with just about any wine of your choice. They also have few beer selections in case you have someone in your group not into wine. I really enjoy the Live music on Fridays and Saturdays but it can get pretty crowded.<//Review><resp>{'time': 1518733536500, 'text': 'Jill!  Thank you for your review!

Great selection of wines.  Live music Fri and Sat nights.  Really friendly staff.  Sat mornings are open during the farmers market and features a long list of $5 mimosas.  White peach is my fav!< /review>

Just had a new navigation + backup camera installed on my car and these guys were the absolute best! My car has been a PIA since the second I got it, so it came as no surprise to me that this team ran into some hurtles but the team at All Around Sound did an amazing job getting everything up and running! I’m so appreciative of all the hard work they did to get everything working top notch and the time they took to show me all the settings etc! It looks and sounds great!< /review>

I had a radio and alarm system installed in this classic 67 and got way more than I expected. The radio sounds great and I can breathe easy knowing that my car is protected from bumper to bumper and everywhere in between!! These guys went above and beyond and gave new meaning to the words customer service!!< /review>

<text>I recently had my Sequoia in to have the speakers system upgraded. They did an amazing job. Quality speakers and installation. They listen to what I wanted and got it spot on. Everyone I delt with at the shop was very nice and knowledgeable. I am so happy with their work I will be back in the future.</text></record></dataset><record>

I came in to put to install apple car play and the and ended up putting a whole new system into my car. I love my system, my younger brother loves it as well. *maybe more than i.    i will be back for all the future cars i own. Don't waste your time with other companies. They stand behind their install work and they've installed a quality system for me!</Text>

Super sweet. I paid a little more for my deck but saved a ton on installation over best buys quote. Came out real walking around money ahead and got to support a local antrapanure< /Text>

<review>I went in on short notice and with a lot of questions. They were only 50 bucks more than best buy, and had better product. Jessy was patient with all my questions and when i had unrelated speaker issues to his install took his time to help me get it figured out and didnt charge me extra for it. If you want to keep your money in the community and have a good local experience try them out.</review>< gmap_id>

<time>1378119070751<//time><rate>5< /rate><text>My parents recently sold their home in Malibu and have recently move into their new home in Chico. My father retired from the music industry and was looking to have some very specialized stereo equipment installed. He really is quite knowledge about the brands, optimum positioning for sound and prices. He went to the stereo shops in the area as a lark because he felt "little Chico" would never have people with the knowledge to do what he wanted.

Unlike my father, I am not an audiophile, but I do appreciate great customer service and a business that believes that integrity really matters in life.  My dad is still raving about Steve's depth of knowledge and that he even learned some things from him.  Coming from my father, that says a lot.  Unlike another local store, Steve never assumed my dad was an idiot and tried to oversell him what he did not need.

They showed up at the house on time, every time and left everything spotless.  Their prices were a lot less than what my dad would have payed in S. Calif. and even better than if he had bought it online and then payed for the installation separately.

To keep this review honest, my dad asked me to write a great review on his behalf in exchange for dinner out at the Raw Bar.  Since I made the stereo store rounds with him, met the people and agree wholeheartedly Iwith him,  feel this review is fair and honest. This is really a great business run by some really likeable folks that are passionate about sound.</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<text>They installed an after market stereo but the internal system was not installed right so my son's car battery's kept going dead and, we would have to replace them. So buyer beware and have the instelation re checked before you wind up in the same situation< /text></record>

<text>Wow, I made an appointment to have the guys at all around help me with a cd that was stuck in my car player. When I arrived there were lots of employees but no customers. I thought: excellent, I'll be in and out of here in 10 minutes, for 10 bucks. Being in customer service myself, I am always very respectful of others, but I went in and the owner was rude to me. I was shocked and asked who he was... He told me I could go elsewhere if I didn't like filling out his long form, even after I told him I had forgotten my reading glasses. So rude. I'll never go back in that place. I drove over to their competitor and got exactly what I needed at Sound By Dave. They ran right out to my car and tried to help. It wound up that I needed a new stereo and they installed it in 30 minutes. Thanks Sounds By Dave.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I had a problem with radio reception and consulted with them and they seemed to blow me off, mentioned there were no guarantees with their service.  I feel that this was not a big enough job for them to take on.  I was disappointed that they didn't try to fix the problem on the car stereo they installed<//text>

<review>Outstanding service, great price.  After seeing glowing reviews on the internet, I stopped by.  They solved my simple problem quickly without trying to sell me more expensive options.  They did the work while I waited and even changed out one of the power outlets in my 1999 Jeep Cherokee for a USB based one.  They were solution oriented and I felt comfortable and confident from the start.  Great all the way around.  I recommend them.<//review>< pics>

I came to this shop seeking help with a bad alarm installation. I explained my situation and they told me they could help and we scheduled a time to bring in my truck. After diagnosing the situation they presented me with several options. I decided to have the defective alarm removed. They did this for me at no cost. I was impressed and decided to buy a new alarm from them. Being sympathetic to my situation I was offered the minimum advertised pricing on the alarm and modules. I appreciated this very much and because of this I decided to buy speakers, an amplifier, and subwoofers from them. So we scheduled some time for them to install this for me. Now I really can't stress this enough, the installation you get from this shop is as good as it gets. The time, care, craftmanship, and quality are second to none. They custom made mounting adapters for the speakers. They used foam to channel the sound directly through the door channels. Sound deadening was installed. I can't say enough about the quality of sound that I'm getting, it really is amazing. The alarm works flawlessly and all of my complaints with my previous alarm installation were gone. There is no cheap wiring and the alarm is installed in the most secure possible way. They even went as far as to fix the installation of other electronics that were installed incorrectly in my truck. They did this for me at no cost. I felt like I was being treated fairly and the lines of communication were honest and open for the entirety of the project. If you want a top of the line product from an experienced qualified installer don't go anywhere else in town. Take my word on this.<//Text><GmapID>0x80832795c7865f27:0xcf25b90263c6b30< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

A huge thank you to Jason for working on two of my Mac computers.  He communicated with me through all stages in the process and he did so much work on my computers so quickly.  Jason replaced two hard drives and a battery on my computers.  They run great and he even downloaded a writing program I needed.  In terms of value, Jason was reasonable and was so detailed oriented that I will continue to use him and also send as many of my friends to him.

I did some research in the area for Computer repair due to my computer not booting up properly when I started it up.
Upon doing my research I came across Jason the computer guy and found that he had a very high customer satisfaction rating. Not only did he have a high customer satisfaction rating but he had several reviews as well. I dropped my computer off with Jason and he had it repaired in record time. His communication skills are beyond excellent!. He was extremely thorough and explained everything to me before he started, during the procedure and when I picked it up.

I found Jason knowledgeable, courteous, and reasonable.  I would highly recommend him for any computer related repair and/or knowledge.</Review>

I asked him to change my LENOVO 320 HHD to SSD. He did it very fast and even went an extra mile to eliminate a few viruses that I had no idea I had them. He also installed Temp File Cleaner and suggested to install Malwarebytes which I did. I now feel that I have a new computer at my disposition. Thanking you and please keep up your good work and sincere service.<//text>

I am ecstatic with the work the work Jason did to diagnosis and restore my 10 year old HP laptop.  I thought that it was time for a new machine, but Jason made it run like new.  He replaced the hard drive with a better one, restored the BIOS, Windows 10, and my backed up data.  The system now boots up in about 9 seconds where before it wouldn’t boot up at all.  Fast, great price, and excellent communications.  Highly recommend.< /Text>

And really, isn't that what we are all looking for--someone to do the job they're hired to do, and to do it correctly the first time. If that's what you're looking for, THIS IS YOUR GUY!

Thanks, Jason!< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I brought my laptop to Jason so that he could switch it's original battery with a new one. He quoted me $60 for the switch. A day after bringing him the supplies, he told me that the replacement battery i brought him was defective. I was sad to hear this but ecstatic when he was fine with only a $20 payment. Jason then gave me a referral to a more serious computer repair company that ultimately fixed the battery issue with my laptop. He is a great troubleshooter who feels honest from the moment you meet him. Would recommend to anyone that is looking for an answer to their problem.</Text>< Pics>

Highlighted above choices but Jason deserves much more. Beyond his obvious expertise, he’s straightforward, courteous, fairly priced! and patient—- I had questions which he answered — in terms that even I could understand! It’s rare to find someone with equal measures of intelligence & integrity. Very clear Jason could handle the most complicated tech issues as well as my common situation. (Replacing battery & hard drive).
Note: I don’t often write reviews but felt compelled because of my superb experience with Jason which started from 1st phone call.  I spoke to other computer repair technicians ... not even close!
And you can drop computer off or he will come to you! (COVID Protocol Compliant).</Review>

My 'vintage' MacBook Air had a little accident, and my battery completely stopped functioning. This is my work computer, so it was important to have it repaired quickly, and by a trustworthy person. I'm so glad I found Jason!

Jason was excellent at communication, and pointed me to a aftermarket battery online to purchase. It arrived quickly, and I dropped my laptop off for the swap on a Friday morning and surprisingly he was done by that afternoon! He even went above and beyond my expectations by freshening up a few other components, and now my old MacBook Air is working great.

Jason is very knowledgeable, honest, and is a really nice guy! I'll definitely use him again for my computer repair needs.< /review>

I was having issues with the internal battery and optical drive on my HP laptop. I bought the replacement parts and Jason was able to quickly swap out the old battery and optical drive with the new ones and tested them to make sure they were working before I picked it up. Jason also performed additional diagnostic tests on my laptop and recommended I change the internal hard disk, which will improve the boot up time and access speed. He gave me a list of replacement drives to choose from and I was very appreciative, so I plan to take his advice. All-in-all, I'm incredibly happy with Jason's service and I will send him all future business. I highly recommend Jason to anyone who's having laptop issues.<//Review>< pics>

<review>I wouldn't normally bother reviewing a business under the circumstances I'm about to describe, but Jason The Computer Guy does NOT deserve a perfect five-star rating. I was to drop my computer off yesterday morning for him to assess, arriving on time at exactly the spot outside his home/office he indicated. He never showed up, and two calls to his number went to voicemail. It wasn't until several hours later that I received a text from him with a nonsensical reason for not showing up, and implicitly blaming me for not reaching out to him in a way that suited him. I'll never know how good his work is because I don't trust him enough to want to find out, but I do know he does not merit a perfect quality score.<//review><Rating>1</Rating><user_id>107515584901547682324</user_id><date>1613500075260</date><gmapID>0x80db1bf312a40c83:0x68b915305b2ea90a<//gmapID>< name>

<text>After looking at reviews for computer repair and service providers in the area I selected Jason as my first choice because of the stellar reviews he's received. I'm glad I did because he lived up to all the accolades. He was honest and straight forward, knowledgeable and reasonable in his fees for his time. Jason was exceptional in his responsiveness  and in  keeping me informed about his progress.  He replaced a hard drive for my iMac with no up charge on the drive and finished the job with in a day after receiving it from Amazon. Jason operates out of his home in Pam Springs so it felt a bit strange handing over my Mac to a stranger on the sidewalk and giving him cash for the new hard drive, but his customer's trust was a big factor in selecting him and I would not hesitate to do it again.</text><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

I had issues with booting up my first gaming tower/pc. Spent all day looking through websites and youtube for solutions. As a last resort I decided to contact Jason and he was available next day. I dropped off the computer and throughout the day he updated me and told me all the issues he resolved. Same day repair and pick up. 10/10 recommend!!< /Review>

Jason is the consummate professional. He was punctual, efficient, knowledgeable, and adept at his
craft.  He was most accommodating in that he expedited the process for me as I had a deadline.
He was also quite patient which I appreciate as I
am ignorant in this arena. I wholeheartedly recommend him.

Jason is a very professional, and friendly guy.  He responds quickly by text, and keeps you informed of any problems he has found, offers solutions, and  gives quotes before purchasing anything. His charges are very reasonable, and his tech skills are great. My computer has never run faster and I couldn't be happier.  He goes out of his way to meet your needs. You can believe all the reviews written here, and I too highly recommend his services.<//Review>

Jason was the most reliable and trustworthy computer techs that I have ever met. He responded instantly and was able to fix my Mac's hard-drive within days! He was open with what was going on and made me feel like my property was in the right hands! To top all of this off, he even dropped my computer off to me whenever he was done with it! I will never go anywhere else and will continue to recommend this guy to anyone in the area!</Review>

He responded to my voicemail right away, received my laptop the following morning, cleaned it of malware and viruses, and returned it in 2 days. The laptop worked faster than it had in years. In the process, he suggested I upgrade my aging hard drive and OS. I ordered the Samsung hard drive he recommended from Amazon, and he installed it and upgraded me from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10. Jason provides excellent service and communication. He's knowledgeable, responsible and was willing to answer all my questions. It could not have been a better experience.</Review>< pictures>

I recently required assistance in upgrading my laptops. I read a review of Jason The Computer Guy. All was positive so I decided to contact him. I left a message and he responded promptly with suggestions. He upgraded the hard drives to SSD’s and increased ram on both laptops. He transferred (cloned) all the data and applications to the new drives. Everything is seamless and there is no evidence of the transfers. Both computers are “smoking” fast. Jason is competent, efficient, reasonable with fees, and honest. He is my go-to guy for computer requirements</text>

Within an hour, my laptop was picked up and Jason purchased and installed a new hard drive that got my laptop running faster than when I purchased it! I was out of date and that was handled immediately as well. Jason updates you throughout the process and gives expert advice on how to move forward with your computer. Don't hesitate to hire Jason whether your concern is for his knowledge or price because he takes care of you all the way around with no worries whatsoever.<//text>

My laptop recently died and I hired Jason to fix it. I couldn't be happier! Jason is smart, fast, knowledgeable, and very reasonable in cost. His communications are timely, complete, and clear. My laptop is blazing fast again, like straight out of the showroom. Thanks so much!<//review>

<text>Jason, is our new computer person. I needed someone to fix my laptop computer that had so many issues that I've been dealing with for over a year. I was actually ready to give up on it! I thought I'd try to find an experienced, inexpensive, local person to fix the issues and found Jason. He had very good reviews so I thought I'd try.  Wow the reviews are correct. My computer runs like new and it didn't cost me an arm and a leg. I highly recommend him and I will use him again in the future if we ever need to.< /text></record>

I can not say enough about the quality of service that I have received. They computer is running better than ever. The price was more than reasonable. I also  really appreciate the way Jason checks to see that the computer is doing well and that you are COMPLETELY satisfied. I give him more than 5 stars.<//text>

Quick fix on vacation! My daughter’s laptop broke while on vacation and my wife found Jason online. He was available faster than Best Buy Geek Squad by days. He replied to text immediately, met us same day, and had the laptop fixed the next day. Great service, quality, and nice guy!< /text>

<review>What a great experience from start to finish. To start with Jason called me to ask if he could come earlier to fix my computer problem. As he walked into my office I was checking my computer speed, Jason took over and said he would try something first that would fix it without charge (at this point he was well on his way to 5 stars) He spent a good 1.5 hours on the phone with Go Daddy support in the Philippines before being handed over to a second person. Jason spent a good 3 hours in total, calmly listening and making suggestions until my problem was fixed. He is honest, patient and extremely knowledgeable and professional. I have no problem recommending his services.< /review><Name>Stuart Green<//Name>< userid>

I rarely write reviews and only if the level of service was exceptional. If you are a Mac owner, save your time and money, skip the Genius Bar and call Jason! My hard drive failed on my MacBook and after checking the Apple website,
I realized it could be weeks to even get an appt.
I decided to try Yelp, and I’m glad I did! Jason was a true professional, I dropped my MacBook off, he verified the failed hard drive, sent me a list of hard drives and their prices that day. The new drive took a couple of days to be delivered, but the day after he received it, my baby was ready for pickup! Great communication throughout the whole process and my MacBook is as good as new( maybe even better)! Thanks, Jason< /Review>

<review>My Asus computer crashed during an update with Windows and I couldn't get it to start up. I quickly reached out to Jason for help. I was blown away by his responsiveness and professionalism. I had my computer back within a few days and it's running better than ever. I highly recommend Jason and will continue to go through Jason for any computer issues in the future that I may have.<//review>< Pics>

I had Jason out to see what could be done with my aging HP tower which was getting slower and slower with age and software updates.  He worked some magic and the processing speed was significantly enhanced.  After a few weeks the HP developed more problems and Jason recommended that it was most likely time for a replacement.  He provided three recommendations for the hardware and after some research on my own made a selection of one of the three.  Jason was out yesterday to switch out the computers and I couldn't be more pleased.  He moved all my programs and apps over to the new system.  Bottom line is it's all good now.  Processing speed is light years ahead of the HP and I'm super satisfied.  Jason was patient, thorough and informative.  He is now an esteemed member of my permanent contacts list.  I recommend this guy highly.<//Review>

<Review>I attempted to get two drives - one mechanical and the other M.2 nvme - installed on my desktop unit.  Ultimately neither were installed. Jason took the time to explain how an internal mechanical drive can have an adverse effect on the system and, with the other drive, there was no second alot (and Ill deal with the manufacturer on that).  He was great, professional, and easy to work with.  I recommend him to anyone!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Jason Klein was a referral from a friend who has been a big fan for many years,  We had called three others including geek squad who wanted $300, DA computer who quoted a high price and our long-standing computer guru who wanted $150 an hour--his previous charges were $45 per hour/  Jason--$60 per hour.
Our problem was the monitor was dead--Jason arrived and discovered loose wires (our puppy sleeps on the wires under the desk).  Jason then went through the computer and recommended a new hard drive.  He went on line and got a very good price at Best Buy.
Jason then looked at our old computer--again on line and got an incredible low price for a windows 10 hard drive. Delivery the next day from Best Buy...Jason installed both hard drives and set  up my new computer all in under two hours including the work the day before.
By far he is the very best computer repair guy we have used in the past 25 years and STRONGLY RECOMMEND Jason Klein.

Jason is a master of his craft! I trust him with all future computer related needs.

I reached out to him about updating my desktop hardware, as they were 10 years old and definitely showing their age. He asked what I planned to use the computer for and from there he sent me what I'd need to purchase to upgrade it. He gave me a variety of price levels to choose from for the new hardware that all meet the specs i needed to achieve my end goals.

He even consolidated the hard drive of my old rundown laptop so that all my documents were on the updated computer and offered to recycle the laptop for me! How awesome! I hated lugging that device around and didn't know how to properly dispose of it. Glad to have all my files in one place and finally only one device!

Bottom line: he's affordable, knowledgeable, communicative, and friendly. Highly recommend you give him a call stop wasting time searching because you won't find better.<//Review>

<review>I was going to spend the money on a brand new laptop even though i loved mine.  Then i came across Jason and he assured me he could affordably breathe some new life into my older Sony Vaio, and he was TOTALLY RIGHT!!  It now operates like a brand new computer!  I would totally recommend Jason's expertise for your older slower computer upgrades!<//review>< user>

With the Apple store In the Coachella valley closed due to the Covid pandemic, it was a relief to have Jason come to the rescue. He diagnosed the problem with my MacBook Air and fixed it immediately. He steered me to the website where the parts could be purchased so there was no markup on that. His price was half of what another computer repairman quoted me. He also communicates regularly with you so you know what's happening. Reasonable rates and a find.</text>

I called Jason and he quickly returned my call and showed up on time .   He did excellent work and answered all my questions completely .  He set up my computer and installed Windows 10 .  He also too extra time to show me things I did not know how to do properly .  He was very patient , pleasant , professional and fast .  I will certainly use him in the future and recommend him to family and friends .<//review>

Jason is very knowledgeable and professional. He previously replaced a fan in a hp notebook for me.  This time he’s changing four of my computers from Windows 7 to Windows 10, replacing old hard drives with new SSD drives, cloning old hard drives to SSD drives, and setting up computers to printers....quite the undertaking! With the new SSDs and operating system, my older computers are running as fast as a new one.
Jason’s fees are very reasonable.
I’m glad I found him!< /Review>

< Review>
Overall I can strongly recommend Citadel.  They were by far the best price I got (and I met with several local solar companies as you should before signing a contract).  We went into contract in early May 2020.  COVID presented a few challenges for us, and probably was the main cause of us not getting an install until late July.  However, the install was almost flawless with a truly professional crew.  Simply cannot praise them enough.  They did an amazing job with hiding the conduit so it was entirely invisible.  The panels are low rise (see photo) and while I expected the panels to be more imposing you really don't know they are there.  Also, as a roofing company, they understood how to deal with a cement tile roof installation.

We went with their recommended panels (REC) 320 watt even though most installers are selling 350 watt panels now.  320 watt are sort of "last year's model" but we had room for additional panels and going with the 320 watt panels saved money.  If you are getting high quotes for 350 watt panel installation this is a possible alternative for you.

I will say I considered holding back one star because of the project management process.  Our sales contact Gideon was terrific, but the handoff to project management had a few bumps.  It seems like their project managers are stretched thin, and as a result we did not get the attention we should have during the long wait between contract execution and installation. While that was frustrating at times it was not a dealbreaker. In the end our project manager rebounded and managed the permit process and installation coordination well so he earned back that last star.  He was easy to work with but would have benefited from a little more supervision? As I said not a dealbreaker just an area for improvement for Citadel to take note.

Our first bill post-solar full month bill is is due in September but the system has been cranking since day one.  You can feel comfortable going with Citadel for this investment!  We are very pleased with this job.

PROS:  Very competitive price; very professional company with excellent installation; good customer support (so far); smooth installation process with highly qualified installers; honest; fair

CONS: Some lag time after contract execution; project support lagged at times prior to installation.

PROJECT: 23 solar panels with a main panel upgrade.  7.36kW system.  Enphase IQ7 inverters. REC320NP solar panels.

COST: $23,000 +/- including main panel upgrade.

EXPECTED TAX CREDIT: $6,000.  Net cost $17,000 +/-.</Review>

Wasted my time, waste of money and not worth to make any business with them. My system was installed 2months ago and up to now it’s not yet inspected and NO permit to operate, WHY? because their staff can’t make it right, do their job and respect my time. Please go somewhere else and I don’t recommend this company because they will rush you to install the system, RUSH YOU TO SIGN THE CONTRACT TO PAY THEM then MAKE YOU WAIT FOREVER.

Excellent customer service.  I worked with several contacts during our battery project.  Everyone was professional, responsive and courteous.  The sales representative worked around our needs and we negotiated a deal that fit our budget. The installers were efficient, professional and neat. I would definitely recommend them for your upcoming projects.<//review>

I signed a contract with Citadel nearly a year ago for Solar and batteries, and I am still waiting on them to come back and finish everything (paid in full for everything months ago).  Horribly unorganized, constant turnover with project managers, and they certainly don't seem to keep their promises in regards to scheduling.  The work they do seems professional, but good luck getting them to show up and finish what they start.  I would look elsewhere for solar and batteries- there seem to be plenty of other options out there.< /review>< Pics>

The original plan we developed for you included a part that our manufacturing partner unexpectedly stopped making shortly after your battery installation.

Honestly, I put this off forever, and I was dreading this because of all the horror stories I had heard. My first experience  with another company was terrible, and they broke tiles on my roof during the inspection. But a friend recommended Citadel, and once I talked with Kevin Babcock, I was so glad I went with them! Kevin answered all my questions (on several occasions!), and he and Ashley Donald worked hard to qualify me for two Tesla batteries through a grant program from PG&E. They helped me with the financing and everything. Now I have a system that has the best rated panels, and two backup batteries, and I couldn't be happier! Would highly recommend them, they treated me and my home with respect. Very happy with my choice.< /Text>

Extremely unorganized, no respect for anyone time, they don’t even communicate with each other. I hired citadel with the hope of supporting local company but who knew I was asking for trouble. This is 3rd time scheduling city inspector and still failed, not because of something unforeseen but a very obvious inspection requirements (installation of EV charger in garage). At this point, I wonder if they even care about their customers at all?  Do yourself a favor and stay away.

3/24 Update: hence the disastrous service continues. The promise was to install my EV charger on 3/23 but as usual they didn’t show up and didn’t bothered to let me know until I inquired if they are coming or not. Now that tech is not showing up, my inspection is cancelled again (4th or 5th time lost count at this point). As responded by the owner that they are going to fix hiccups, no you didn’t.

3/29 Update: the incompetency continues. These people will not pay attention to the permits requirements. Failed inspection again because they did not followed the instructions issued by the city. I just wish to get over with this kind of mess by Citedal.

7/06 Update: Here I am again with these irresponsible company. They did poor job of installing my main panel (not sealed properly, exposed wood to outside environment) as well as loose enphase main junction box plus improper move of my internet cable box. They made an appointment to come and fix it but the technician at last minute decided he cant make it. We agreed to that he will come on Saturday but he did not show up, neither informed me what was happening. It has been more than 10 days they still have not figure out if their technician will have time to and fix the mess they have made.< /Text><rating>1</rating>< gmapID>

<text>I previously had Citadel put a new roof on my house in Berkeley in preparation for selling in 2018. I had installed solar on that house in 2002 (the "early days"). I chose Citadel because they did both solar and roofing and the solar panels needed to be removed and replaced after the new roof was installed. They did an excellent job.
After my move to Lafayette I wanted to install solar panels on my new house. Once again I chose Citadel because of my previous excellent experience. They did an excellent job in planning the installation, installing and getting me up and running. I highly recommend them.
I now look forward to monitoring my progress using the Solar Edge app on my phone and anticipating the PG&E savings accumulating each month.< /text>< Pictures>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Review>I selected Citadel to install solar panels in Aug due to a very attentive Sales person. Unfortunately it has been a super stressful experience afterwards (probably the last thing you want during this pandemic).

As some other people mentioned, they didn't talk to each other themselves. I was communicated several times with multiple wrong dates. After calling them hundreds of times, I finally got the confirmation from three different people/groups that my panel installation date is today.

Well, guess what happened, nobody showed up !!!!!!

As what I learned so far, if you are located in bay area, bite your own nails and prepare to wait for a long long time until anything actually happens. They probably just want to save their multiple trips regardless how the customer is screwed up

Unfortunately I still have the contract with them and can only wish the next date they will provide is actually a real date.

The crews that did the work were unbelievable. They made sure every detail was right and did a fantastic job. Had a few miscommunications with the office but everyone made it right.

Install was fine but the so called monitoring is just a bunch of bull.  Can't get anyone to allow you to actually monitor each panel, currently putting out less then they should-the inverter went out after 1 year and they never notified us(hence they REALL DON'T MONITOR) We had to notify them then it took weeks to get a new inverter from Solar Edge. So basically once they take your money and say they will monitor the system they don't.  It's a huge problem that they refuse to address.<//Review>

<Text>What a great experience.  All levels of service and installation were outstanding.  John our sales rep was very knowledgeable and very patient while answering all of our questions.  Its a huge investment but John's experience and easy to understand answers made our decision very comfortable.  The installation was flawless.  The guys were friendly and professional.  The job took a day and everything looked terrific.  They were neat and extremely careful to not damage anything.  Sonya kept us updated from start to PG&E approving us to use our solar panels.  I give Citadel 5+ stars and highly recommend them.

<Text>Citadel roofing and Solar were recommended to me due to quality of work.  I was looking for a long lived real roofing company that knew what they were doing in Solar.   Citadel Roofing and Solar fit the bill.  The Citadel team was professional and did all the work in-house with no-subcontracting.  During the install I spoke with several employees: salesman, installers, project manager, electrician and coordinators I was impressed that they all loved Citadel and spoke highly of how well they are treated!  (A huge Compliment the the management and ownership!!)  We have and aging ultralight weight tile roof and Citadel installed a 15.9Kw Solar System this March.  Their work was very detailed and well planned out.  Just plain excellent work.  The install went great, even though it rained almost every day.  I know my roof and Solar are in top shape with now after the citadel team install.  I only wish I had done it sooner.</Text><Time>1525821226146< /Time>< userid>

Fast, courteous service.  They always kept us informed and are always willing to answer any all questions.  We had several quotes  and they were the only one that didn't want to install more panels than we would need plus were much easier on the bank account.   We've had no issues since the installation.   They even fixed some roofing and installed a new breaker panel, without adding to the cost.</Text>

Also the crew headed by Juan were so easy to have around the house and were considerate of my needs and they worked under extreme circumstances for most of the time they were here.  The weather certainly give them any breaks but they kept on working in the rain until they got the job done.
So now I am looking forward to a comfortably warm house without guilt over my power usage!
Thanks so much.

Citadel came out and met with me about a month ago after I inquired online. The representative was very professional, but also very funny. Really made me feel comfortable about making the investment. My system is already installed! We are now just waiting for PG&E to give us the green light to turn it on. I can't wait. 5 stars for Citadel!  Thank you so much! -John<//review>

Citadel Roofing & Solar completed our solar installation this past June. From start to finish, their sale staff (John) and team of installers were exceptional. We interviewed 5 other solar companies and by far Citadel was the best and only choice for us. Their proposal presentation was outstanding and the best price. They went above and beyond with customer service, installation, and responding to any questions or concern that we had. The system installed is exactly what we were looking for and we are thrilled to see significant reductions in our utilities.  You won't go wrong selecting Citadel.</Text>

<review>Citadel designed and installed a 12 KW solar system and reproofed (with 4 inch foam insulation) our church sanctuary.  Our roof is of very unique construction, but Citadel worked with us to get a design for both the solar and roof that we are 100% satisfied with. The installation itself was unexciting - the best kind!  Two members of our congregation also had Citadel do their solar based on the great job Citadel did for the church. And it is comforting to know the same contractor did both the roof and solar - no finger-pointing between contractors if something should go wrong.< /review><Rating>5< /Rating><name>Terry Rossow< /name>< pictures>

<pics>None< /pics><review>As an electrical engineer, I’ve been interested in solar for a long time. I've seen some of the recent advancements that have taken place in the technologies, so that got me even more interested. After meeting with John Moberg from Citadel Roofing and Solar at a small event with one of my neighbors across the street, I was shown some of the hardware that would be installed on a tile roof. My only objection to solar at this point was that I had a tile roof, and I didn’t think a tile roof would lend itself to having solar panels installed. Seeing the gear that would be installed on my tile roof, made up my mind. Working with John at Citadel made it easy. He answered every question I had. He took the time to explain the background of the company and the technology. He made it a very easy process for me and I felt completely at ease working with John.
My experience with Citadel has been terrific. I’ve had no problems at all. John has been there for every question I’ve had, and he’s worked me through every step of the process. I’ve been very pleased to work with John and Citadel, and I would certainly do it again. I would absolutely recommend Citadel Roofing and Solar to my friends. Citadel has been great for me and I recommend them to everyone.<//review>< Resp>

What an amazing company! We had the best experience with Citadel. Right after this past rain storm hit  We noticed a horrible leak coming into master closet upstairs I called a few companies and Citadel was the most prompt. After deciding to go with them our rep  Kevin Babcock ( who is absolutely fabulous) said he would have a guy come out inspect the roof for measurements and  he ended up staying and fixing the leak. Kevin was so prompt with everything. Made sure we  fully understood everything about our estimate. Definitely was an open book 😊, which we appreciated so much. Needless to say they will be out this Monday to start the roof and the week after to start our solar. This is the best customer service I have had the pleasure of dealing with. If I could give them 10 starts I would.< /review>

Citadel installed my solar 2 months ago. Extremely pleased with their service. John is a very informed Sales guy and walked me through all of the specs and expected performance.  Allison and Tiffanie handled everything else.  The installation team was very professional and worked until 8pm on the 2nd day to make sure everything was complete.  The system has performed as expected.</Text>

Thanks To Nathan Riddell we had a very pleasant experience when we were looking for a company to install a solar system in our So Cal home. He is a very polite young man and could answer all of the questions that we had about the system. I would recommend him to all our friends that are looking to upgrade to solar.</Text>

<Review>John, Eric and the entire team at Citadel R&S were amazing to work with. We just completed the first full year of our solar panels and enjoyed our solar system even more when we got a credit at our true-up statement! John and the sales team was a breeze to work with and were patient while we took our time picking the financing option that was going to work best for us. They designed a system that would maximize the space we had available on our roof. Once we pulled the trigger it was a simple and painless process. When the installation of the panels was more challenging than expected due to how our sub panels were originally installed the installation team at Citadel completed the task and didn't change their price when it took additional time and personnel to accomplish. Their work was clean and left the job site better than they found it. My roof was free of leaks and my panels have performed flawlessly. I have been and will continue to recommend Citadel to my friends and family who are in the market for any roofing or solar needs.< /Review>< UserId.>

I called and left a message for Citadel to give me a price quote.  I got a call back and message from Kevin requesting that I call him back.  I called at 2:00 and the receptionist said they are closed for lunch until 2 and they could take a message.  I called back at 2:10 and spoke to reception again.  I informed the person that I am trying to reach Kevin and I have his extension number.  The receptionist said that she is not authorized to connect me to Kevin and I can only leave a message.

A note to the business owner - if I am trying to spend ~$15,000 with your company, please do not place barriers between the customer and the sales people.

I will not be choosing Citadel for my roofing project, due to the difficulties I had getting in contact with them. When a customer calls you trying to give you business, the response should be "Thank you, let me get you a price quote" not "I'm not authorized to connect you to the sales representative, let me take a message."

Citadel lost an opportunity to make some money today.</Review>

<text>Crews just finished our home today and we are 200% satisfied from the start of the design process to getting the system turned on. For the staff and crews, shout out to Edgar and his crew, for being professional, on time, and working to install our system, even when it started to rain, crews did not stop, now that is service!!

We would highly recommended this company for your roofing and solar needs, fast , dependable, professional service and install.

If the number one home  builder in Fresno county (GVHOMES) uses the Number one roofer and solar company, Citadel, the choice is simple, you want the best, you need to hire the best in the industry.

Don’t select Solar without giving Citadel a call,  they will walk you through the steps to ensure you have the best system available to meet your power needs.

Ohhh ya,   SO LONG PGE bill.   Go ahead and raise your KW usage rates....Citadel has got us covered.

Thanks again,
Mike and Katie L.<//text>< user_id>

I am so impressed with the excellent and prompt service we received from Evan Bateman at Citadel. He was very informative, knowlegeable, supportive, and patient with the many questions we had. In addition he was not pushy, which I experienced with other companies. I will definatley call them again when are ready for solar.</review>

<Review>Updated Post Sept 2019: It has now been a year and I can now report the one year result of my Citadel solar system. Simply put, I could not be more delighted and thankful. My total electric cost for the past 12 months was $157. That includes NEM true-up and delivery costs and compares to my prior 12 months electric cost of $4,133.  That's a $3,976 savings!!  This system will pay for itself even faster than my estimate upon purchase. And even better, no issues. A reason I used Citadel was because they were a roofing expert first.  After hearing all the horror stories of roof leaks from friends and others, I wanted to avoid any roofing issues. Citadel performed and two of our friends have since used them as well. I'm certainly glad I did.  Thank you Nathan and everyone at Citadel.

Original Post Sept 2018: Citadel installed a 9.1kWh residential system on my steep-roofed home.  An excellent job, fair price and pleasant experience. Their personnel were professional, always on time, and easy to work with.  Installation crew were professional, meticulous and clearly cared about doing a high quality job.  System was inspected and PG&E approved far ahead of original schedule.  Highly recommend.  Only wish all companies could be like Citadel!<//Review>< Response>

<review>The staff at this store is so helpful and patient....and I have proof.  They not only helped me troubleshoot my iPhone and iPad., they helped me set up a Google account, as I was determined to give them a shout out for all their help.  Basically, they let me invade their store for as long as I needed help. Lorena & Joseph are so nice and welcoming that I’m considering moving in here! Yes, I’m kidding....and I don’t want to scare them, but living in here wouldn’t be bad!  And I’d never have st struggle with technology again....😍</review></record></dataset><record>

We went in to just pick up our new phones that we had ordered through the app  and we ended up chatting as if we had known each other for years!  We will definitely be recommending this location to all of our friends and family. Thank you Kim and Caleb for being so kind to us.

Caleb was very helpful in my mom getting a new phone. He helped her pick the right phone for her needs rather than solely trying to up sell her. He helped her with transferring everything over from her old phone to her new phone and made it all very easy. He showed her which cases would fit her new phone and also helped her put on a screen protector. He was friendly and sociable. He made the entire experience simple and easy.< /review>

<text>They got things started but overall nothing was truly done. I ordered the device online and went to the store to pick up the device. It took very long to retrieve, unable to honor $50 off samsung buds deal due to none in stock. Lastly, I got the run around " call back and talk to so and so" only for that person to feed me "policy." Moreover, the same inability they were proclaiming, the ATT store on Blackstone was able to complete. Nice people but ineffective.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><UserId.>113119691540521642585</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Johnny was working and not wearing a mask. My brother almost died of Covid when I asked him to wear a mask he said he can't breAth. I am a RN and have to wear a N95 for 12 hours. I explained this to him and he still did not care. Other customers were coming in and he would half way put his mask on but never once wiped down the counter in between customers. He is one of the reasons why people are still getting sick and there are so many dead. I also asked for the manger and he said he was the manager. I asked who was above him and he said no one. He acted untouchable and it was the worst thing in the world that I asked him to wear his mask properly and not wear it as a chin gaurd<//text>

I WILL RANK THEM NEGATIVE IF I HAD AN OPTION. Had a really bad experience with this location. First they sold me a "blacklisted" phone which means the phone had been reported stolen at one point. For 2 days I went back several times to this location, was told to go to their corporate branch, and spent 4 hours in total talking to the 800 # for them to unsuspend my phone so I can use it. Finally, Crystal who was the sales rep there called the ATT 800 # and was advised to call different numbers, she gave up because at this point its been 2 days since I don't have a working phone (I work in the field sometimes and not having a working phone is a grave inconvenience for me ). They gave me a different phone and was told that because of the inconvenience they will give me  a screen protect for free...but what they meant was I am not going to charge you for the 2nd screen protect on the phone that I am giving you  as replacement for the blacklisted one that I had sold you couple of days ago.  So essentially I didn't get anything for free. I still paid for the screen protect that they installed on the blacklisted phone. It is not the cost but it's the deceit that I felt from them.  Our lives are too busy  to go through this much trouble.  The owner of this branch needs to train his managers and employees better. IF YOU WANT A SMOOTH TRANSACTION GO TO THE CORPORATE BRANCH on Herndon and Blackstone.  This Fig Garden branch is just a authorized retailer.</Text>

Let me digress, we don’t know anything about 3G, 4G or 110G.  One of your female reps, I think her Crystal A, took the time to explain how ATT could benefit us. We felt kinda bad because we monopolize her time, but she didn’t seems to mind as just smiles while explaining the various features.  Because of her attentive and immaculate service we are signing with ATT and recommending the company to our friends and family.

<Text>I went into the store looking to get information on wifi for my apartment. I was immediately assisted by Angel. He explained everything clearly and really took his time. He didn't pressure me into buying anything that day. I  came back a few days later with my boyfriend to get everything set up and Angel was available to help me again. So, thank you Angel for making the process smooth.

Huge bonus: the store was kept clean both time I visited.<//Text>< username>

< Review>
The Staff is great, helpful and polite but I have one major complaint. Apparently they force you to buy accessories if you trade in a phone. The Store on Shaw and Blackstone didn't require that, so I just went down the street from here to do my upgrade. I'm a former rep for an ATT store in Palmdale and that's something I've never heard of. The staff informed me it was company policy, so I don't blame them, but it doesn't seem right and in alignment with what all ATT stores typically do.< /Review>

<text>I have only visited this Mobile Estates/Mobile Home Park (I'm not sure what the difference is between the two, lol), so from a visitors eye view: It is a beautiful and fairly large Mobile Home Park. It must have been built into the large naturally existing hill(s) there🌄. The entrances (there are 3 of them) are at the bottom of the hill, and as you travel up into the park  through the winding roads🏞️, right in the very center of the park, which all the roads appear to lead to, is a big gorgeous glittering LAKE!! 🤯...✨🗻🤩< /text><rating>4< /rating><Date>1614549899285</Date>< Resp>

This park has really seen excellent improvements. All of the streets/pavement will be done soon. The new entry gates, new lighting, and walkways are a dream.<//review>

We knew who was who now with so many transients and no onsite managers its horrible. Les frame and the owners think that by putting up barriers we are safe? Have they thought who will be here to release those gates in case of a major catastrophe? The power goes out theres a fire and we are trapped in here.

<Review>The new owners and management are the best we've ever had here. The improvements being made are 2nd to none. The park is quiet and we have a tight-knit community. This is a great place to live and is only getting better. I can't wait to see what the future brings. If you're planning on buying you will enjoy yourself.</Review><user_name>Jess P< /user_name>< GmapID>

Lots of good times at this park. Really hoping all the activities continue. The previous managers did a darn good job at bringing the community together as a family and making this place a beautiful place to live. Since they were replaced the park is going downhill again. No onsite managers, broken or stolen fountain in the lake, late night looters at the lake, parking out of control, residents getting stuff stolen from their porches and much more! Management company does nothing to alleviate these issues.< /review>

Les frame management
1635 Aviation Blvd in redondo beach
if they don’t give us residents the town hall that we’ve all been asking for or even the chance to speak to them about our complaints and everything that is going on then I’m sure they wouldn’t mind a nice personal visit from all of us   lol so if we don’t get the owners number or a town hall we are going to have to take a little trip down to redondo beach

My house was egged and I found rice grains down my street when does this end I personally do not believe that the gates are going to prevent this my son made a great point to me the way they put them people will still be able to get into the park! Ugh disappoint< /text>

This place took a long time to clean up and look good. Thanks to the managers our community was starting to come together as a family. These are the best managers we have had and now that is being taken away from us. I wish the residents opinions would be taken into consideration when these kinds of decisions are made we are the ones who who live here and know what management is like. They would take care of our seniors in the park and were very proactive with the kids. Big big mistake replacing them! Who knows what will become of this park now! Very outraged longtime resident!🤬</text>

Last year my husband and I applied here to live. We were in the process of buying our first home together. We had everything approved from the bank, and all of our paper works done. all we need was our park approval. They took WEEKS to process our paper work. Stephanie and Jess were horrible at keeping us updated on the process. And! They adjusted our income so we our application would get denied!? Why would anyone do that? I felt like they did everything, they could so we couldn’t get approved for the park. I felt so discriminated against. After almost two months, Stephanie calls to tell me I wasn’t approved, because I had too many people living with me (their were 4 of us)  It was a 3 bedroom home, California law states I can have up to two people living in each room. Long story short we didn’t get the place. Worst experience ever. I do not recommend this place. Especially for young couple. Please get new management.</Review>

<review>I recently visited a family member here it has changed alot! This placeis beautiful now and my cousin stated the new managers and new owners have really cleaned the place up and it is very noticeable! The lake is nice and full with a new gazebo. I was here during christmas time and it seems to be very family friendly. The managers had a nice christmas event and my cousins little boy received a big christmas present and they had a cute little parade and a nice dinner. Lots of hospitality from the managers and the residents seemed very happy unlike other times i have visited when there were different managers and the residents lived in a rundown park with managers who discouraged being neighborly and did nothing for the homeowners. I am glad there is new managers who actually care and encourage family participation. 😊<//review>< Pictures>

If I could give a zero I would!!  Worst property manager and maintenance person I have ever seen in my 10+  years of property management myself.  Forced a bed ridden senior citizen to walk all the way to the office to get her monthly bill that they were e-mailing  to her granddaughter for many months just to prove a point.  When asked why they said they "never said that" contradicting the emails they sent, then their story changed to "they placed it in the mailbox"  yet  due to the outrageous thievery in this park with the mail  the family already had me place security cameras up and the only thing they saw was the maintenance person using my  personal tools that I left there while I was helping the family fix some things on the trailer.... Bottom line very abusive to senior citizens and to military families....
Tries to force people to sign leases even though the city code says they don't have to and when they don't they just harass them untill they leave or sign one.< /text>

Picture is fake its very run down.Wow 1 star is over justice. I would have left 0 if possible. Used the "car wash" today. First off ghetto buttons don't read what each click means then neither soaps work. I try 2 time spending $3.00 in total. I politely talk to the gentleman and explain i would like reimbursement  for the money I spent since it did not work. Then he makes up tons of excuses saying I didn't check the soap today, maybe the soap pump is not working. Then he says what do you want me to do i said politely again please reimburse me. He gets even more agitated and says it has to come out of my pocket then slams $3.00 on the counter! I took it threw it in his face f*** you! Never never ever ever going here again horrible condition and customer service!!!! Buy here at your own risk...

Very disrespectful to my mother over her telling them that soap was not coming out of the brush for the self wash car wash. Paid 3.00$ for just water? Could've just did that at home. Never going back. Run down anyways. Valero and 76 can take my money instead.</Review>

<Text>We foster cats and kittens and we bring them here for urgent checkups. Making an appointment is easy as we do it online, and the curb side pick up with video or phone call makes it so easy. The doctor and staff members here are so nice and knowledgeable. They really remember their patients.

The price is higher for us non-profit foster care givers but they're definitely a great vet for your lovely fur-family.<//Text>< UserId.>

I am so happy to have found Petsadena.  After adopting our rescue during Covid I was unsuccessful at reaching any other vet clinic and they were super responsive and professional.  When we finally got in to see the vet (Which was that same week) they were so organized and made our first time seamless and stress free.  Their intake assistant was so reassuring and truly delightful.  The fact that we were still able to remotely connect to "sit in" on our Pup's first visit was just icing on the cake.  Thanks, Petsadena!</text>

My pup began going to Petsadena during the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although he is a very anxious pup without me at the vet, the team at Petsadena were very kind, understanding of my dogs anxiety, and still gave him great care. Their ability to talk to you while they work with your animal is impressive and the technology is great! Since our first visit, we've had a few tech visits and a day-of appointment that all went smoothly and were helpful. Thanks!<//text>

Amazing experience with our cats.  We had to bring Titus in today for a wellness check up, he's gotten a little fluffy lately.  Anyway, we see Dr. Michelle she is absolutely amazing-thorough, thoughtful, informative and all around great doctor.  Camil and rest of staff are patient and very accommodating.  We are so happy with the care we received for Manny and now Titus.  A+< /Text>

<Text>We had our first appointment (and first emergency visit) this past week, and we are SO endlessly grateful for the entire Petsadena team. Their no-contact process made us feel super safe, and they were consistently communicating when our puppy was in crisis. Every single person we interacted with was wonderful - from the person who answered the phone, to the one who came to our car to take our pup inside. If you're in search of a new vet for your pet - look no further!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Luna's first official vet visit as part of our pack. And ours as first time dog owners.

The staff (Camila and Nicole) and veterinarian (Dr. Michelle) made us feel welcomed. They are thorough with communication. Provided me an extensive rundown for caring for a puppy. They have great C-19 protocol in place.< /text>

We love Petsadena— they are always professional and honest with helping our dog stay healthy! One time during COVID we needed to get her in because her paw looked like it had an infection, and they let us drop her off in the morning and the vet saw her between appointments when they had time. So considerate and saved us money from not having to visit an emergency vet. Their current drop off system is also very COVID safe and functional.< /Review>

It was my German Shepard Pamela’s first time here since we are new to the area. She has separation anxiety and they took care of her like she was one of her own to make her feel like she was in a happy place. (She isn’t a fan of the vet)  I am so happy we found it. So glad to call this place our vet for her care. :-)< /Text>

<Text>We love Petsadena! We have two pups - a pug and a great dane mix. We've had nothing but the best experience with the vets and techs here. They are so sweet, they adore our dogs and are so easy to work with. They have an app that makes it so easy to make an appointment, they call and check on our pups after they've had an appointment and there have even been a few times where I've text them pictures of our dogs and a possible ailment and they've been so accommodating and did not make us feel bad about not making an appointment to ask a quick question or to take a quick look. I cannot recommend them enough!< /Text>< pics>

<user_name>Kara Colley</user_name><Text>Dr. Evelynn is thorough in her explanation of procedures and possible causes for illness. I appreciate that she does video chats during COVID so that I can see how my cats are doing in the examination room. After a tragic loss of a pet under anesthesia at another vet, I feel like she goes to great lengths to ensure my other pets are safe before going under.

We foster-failed two sweet dogs in June and one of them has chronic ear issues. Dr. Michelle and the whole team at Petsadena have been wonderful. Rather than just treating the ear infections with antibiotics Dr. Michelle helped figure out the root cause - food allergies. Every single person on the staff that I've interacted with has been a delight and I feel safe leaving our sweet fur babies in their care. The Covid procedures are excellent - video chats during appointments as well as all of the techs wearing masks and face shields. It's not inexpensive but the cost of care is always given up front before anything is done. They're also extremely helpful when I call with what feels like a "dumb question" taking the time to look at our dog's chart and offering advice. I would absolutely reccomend Petsadena to any friend looking for a vet.</review>

<review>We just took our 2 dogs to Petsadena for the first time and we had a great experience. In this weird world, it's odd to hand your dog out the door and just wait in the car - but they video chat with you during the entire appointment so you can see what's happening. Dr. Michelle was so kind and very thorough, explaining everything as she went along (bonus points that she called them my "kids" and told them how cute they are!) Camille (tech) was great about walking us through all of the details so we knew exactly what we were paying for. Our dogs have crazy anxiety and we've not always had positive experiences with other vets, but this team made sure they were really well cared for the entire visit. We will definitely be back. I highly recommend them!</review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Petsadena animal hospital and vets are INCREDIBLE! We got a new puppy and were looking for a vet for her and could not have been more impressed. We’ve gone to Dr Evelyn and she’s beyond amazing: patient, knowledgeable, takes her time really listening to our questions and helping. And huge bonus that our pup LOVES her! They’re super thorough and everyone that works here is as fantastic as Dr Evelyn. Highly highly recommend!!<//text>

My experience with the whole staff at Petsadena has been 100% AWESOME.  Lili who took my initial call in.  Amanda who came outside to greet me and my Golden Retriever: Bailey abd Dr Evelyn herself was fantastic!!!   The follow up was great too. I received a written summary of my visit with recommendations along with two follow up calls ftom staff to see how Bailey was doing.  If you live in Pasadena and adjacent Petsadena is the place for your pets !!!!!    5 Stars</review>< userid>

During Covid the disorganization is even more apparent. Just get a grip, organize! It's not rocket science. And Covid is no excuse. One 2 minute simple phone call to another vet in town, and Bob's your uncle! As opposed to this mess...put on hold, then blah blah...normally never write reviews but I just couldn't help myself.

<Text>So happy we found this place! We went to four other veterinary offices before coming here, and none of the other offices compare to the quality care we received  at Petsadena.

I have been coming here for about 2 Years, and I dealt mainly with Dr.Evelyn who is an extraordinarily Vet. She would call me on the weekends and late nights to give me a status on my dog’s condition. I have  also dealt with Dr. Michelle and she is also outstanding!! She is very detailed oriented and both of these doctors really care about your pets health. I would definitely recommend them !!! Their office staff also excellent!!!< /review>

Took my little pug for his regular check up and shot today and, as usual, from check-in to checkout our visit was warm and stress free.  Dr. Michelle was awesome — cheerful on a Saturday morning, asked questions about updates since our last visit, and answered questions with patience and compassion. She has a terrific bedside manner and the clinic staff was helpful and professional. Thanks Petsadena!<//Review>

<Text>We love Petsadena! It’s been quite a year for our cat army health wise and we are so glad to have found them. We have three cats, and our senior cat recently had to have teeth pulled. It was a major ordeal but Dr Michelle is the best, so it went smoothly. We appreciate their follow up phone calls so much. It shows how much they care. We wouldn’t bring our kitties anywhere else!< /Text>< userid>

< Review>
When my dog had potentially eaten poison, the technician who answered the phone, I think Steve, was dismissive and rude. All he worried about was going home and would not get a vet on the phone or even to call me back . I would like to find a veterinarian who actually takes an interest in our dog and who wants to be informative and helpful. I was surprised because our first visit went well, but when things got a little serious, they under performed!<//Review>

<Text>I love Petsadena! Dr. Evelyn and her staff are wonderful. The office is extremely organized, neat and very welcoming. They are understanding, caring and accommodating. They are a bit pricey but totally worth it. I've had a couple of minor incidents with my mini dachshund, they made me but more importantly my fur-son feel safe and comfortable.< /Text>< pics>

Dr. Evelyn is always so attentive and caring. The staff clearly loves working with animals. They are quick to make emergency appointments, communicate clearly and provide a comfortable space for pets and humans alike. This is a terrific facility and I feel my cat is in good hands when I bring her here.<//Review>

Petsadena is perfect. Amazing staff. Honest, reasonable and caring. Both my dogs receive  treatment from here. We switched from TLC in South Pasadena and could not be more pleased. Our senior dog has bad knees, and they gave us many options for his healing process, since surgery was too invasive. Petsadena is a gem.< /Text>

Dr. Evelyn is a very thorough and kind Veterinarian...  She treats according to your pet's best interest and goes completely beyond the call of duty...My dog needed some specialty treatment and she called me a couple of times off hours to check on his status.  So kind and thoughtful.< /review>

She gave him time to get comfortable with her, she made me feel like she really cared. She reviewed him thoroughly and explained what I needed to know about my puppy's breed and how to care for him at home.
The clinic is super cute and the staff were all friendly and engaging. I am very happy to have Dr. Evelyn from Petsadena as Romeo's vet.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Excellent vet/pet hospital. They are reasonable, not pushy and they always follow up to check in on your pet after appointments. They also allow you to schedule appointments through an app!</text>

This place takes forever. Except a slow process. 2pm appointment is actually a 2:30-2:45. Overall, you’ll be there for an average of 2 hours for a check-up</text>

You did wait longer than usual for your appointment and we apologize for that. We work hard to expedite the waiting room time for all our patients while maintaining the quality of care we offer, but sometimes unexpected circumstances within the hospital slow the process. When these rare situations occur, we attempt to keep our clients in the waiting room updated and informed. With that said, when it comes to our patient’s care, we strive to be as thorough as possible and provide essential information to pet parents so they can understand their pet’s condition and make informed decisions when it comes to treatment. We perform diagnostics at the hospital with results in real time, which allows us to tailor our medical recommendations prior to patients leaving the hospital. While all this certainly adds time to a visit, it also allows us to provide the best care available to pets and their families. Of course, we understand your frustration and respect your time, and we assure you that we will continue doing our best to work as efficiently as possible while maintaining the quality of our care for every patient.'}<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c483174f05c9:0x4943d1b52c2858fd< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My girlfriend and i took our dog in because he has had ear infections and was acting as if he had another one. We expressed this to them they took a quick look in front of us said it was fine we expressed again that he was not acting right and insisted they look again. So they took him to the back to "take a better look" told us he was fine, we paid. Left. Then took him to another vet shortly after and he has an ear infection so bad his ears are bleeding! What did we pay for!?</text>

Dr. Evelyn is awesome! She has been seeing both my dogs for about a year now and always treats them with the best of care! Her staff is super helpful and always remembers to follow up with me after a visit to make sure my pups are on the right track to a healthy recovery! Would absolutely recommend Petsadena Hospital to all my family and friends!<//Text>

I can't thank Petsadena's staff enough. We brought our 5yr old Pomeranian (Jack) in because our baby was having bloody diarrhea. They were so gentile with him and took such great care of him. You have a customer for life!!! I've been to many Veterinarians in Pasadena and I must say that Petsadena is the only Vet I'm comfortable with. Your the best Petsadena!<//Text>

As of October 2017 massive staff turnover continues.  This has been going most of the year. Average front office person lasts a month or two.  There are several new vet techs, one of whom casually told me my cat had lost 2.5 pounds (which should be a major red flag if true).  I told him he was wrong. He reweighed the cat and got it right. No weight loss.  He also forgot to trim the cat's nails as requested.  So, what other errors is he making with, say, with dosages of the vaccines my cat received?  Examples of other problems generated by staff turnover: One gal confirmed my appointment and didn't enter it in the computer so there was no appointment when I arrived. Simple questions have baffled them.  At a vaccination  appointment a new front officer person  asked me what tests and shots my cat needed that day.  I cheerfully provided my best recollection and suggested that she check the cat's records to be sure. It is hard to get through on the phone. Being put on hold for a few minutes is the norm.  I'm hanging in there but not for long if the staff doesn't stabilize.and their quality improve. Much the pity since I think the doctor knows her stuff.< /Text></record>

<Text>Yippee Dog Yeah!!!!
Me and my Charles Theodore Barkley are so happy and grateful to have Dr. Evelyn as his doctor.

He had surgery for a torn ACL and a floating Patella. They did is surgery (11yrs. old.) She came early to reassure. He was there for 6 weeks getting, laser and PT.

He looks better than before. The cost was 1/2 of what others quoted. She also helped me find funding from various charity. I'm on SSI.

I know so many of us we concerned about the great care of our pet families after Dr. K  came after his severe auto car accident. He and his daughter were the best I've ever met.

Dr. E provides the same level of care, as they did and perhaps a little more. I drive 1 hr to see them. It's always worth the drive. Plus, she remembers everybody's name. Stunning!. Makes me feel like they care!

As far of the turn over, I've spoken to a few, asked them why they were leaving.

The responses, they wanted to go back to school to study vet science.

Many are young still trying to decide what they want aa acareer. One woman moved back home out of state.

A few wanted to find somewhere closer work. I recognize her drive time. Its as long as mine.One wanted to learn how to be a groomer instead.

Enough said !!!! No body made us stay, somebody over there must be doing something right .

Thanks Petsadena
We live you Dr. E.😚🐶<//Text><UserId.>115226372922775333421<//UserId.>< pics>

Since Dr. Evelyn Sagastume has assumed the leadership of the Raymond Avenue Animal Hospital (and redubbed it "Petsadena Animal Hospital"), I've had a few routine and urgent medical needs for my dog.  I've been very pleased with the upgrade to the facility and to the staff.  Super friendly and attentive and all give off an air of not only compassion and caring, but of competence.

I hope to see Dr. Sagastume and her team flourish.  I always hope to never need to visit them, but in case I do, I am very glad and confident that they will be there for me and my pets.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Very sad situation that we went through with my puppy and they are the only ones who helped us and when we received the ashes of my puppy, everything was just as we wanted it for our 4-legged son, we are very grateful

<review>Went to the park to BBQ while the kiddos enjoyed the Nice Upgraded play area to our surprise their was no more BBQ pits all were removed but found one on the lower part jogging area . BBQ and came up to play . What a change on it all two different areas for smaller kid's and the pics here are for 5- 12 year olds . Shadow oak park has always been a spot to enjoy especially the sun sets . Rest rooms are a distance from play area and at night it's not lit with light as bright . Kiddo's loved the New look . Thank you west Covina for the needed upgrade 😎🙌< /review>< user>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Nice park in a relatively nice neighborhood area. There are 2 full court basketball courts, tennis courts and large walking paths. Baseball park, bleachers, large parking lot area. Bright lights, lights turn off at around 10:30 or 11 I forget... Cops will come if you are noisy at night bc the park 8s near homes.<//text>< pictures>

Baseball fields need an upgrade quickly, these feilds are the worst I have seen to date, very ugly! I feel sorry for the poor kids that call this there home field! Other than that I guess it's okay for morning or evening walks. They do have 2 tennis courts as we'll as 2 basketball courts.<//review>

7.3.2020 Very little shade on a hot day. There are two basketball courts full of people. This is not a covid safe location. No one was wearing a mask and everyone was constantly yelling at each other on the court. The trash cans were also overflowing.

Aside from the covid concerns at the basketball courts, this location is pretty nice and great for walks with great views.< /Text>

Ok fields for the kids to play ball. Covid all over the basketball courts. It was packed. If I owned a field my bathrooms would be stocked and just way better over all CLEAN.<//Text>

<time>1569398707967< /time><text>This is a nice little park in West Covina. My boys played Little League here but sadly the league folded due to a lack of volunteers. This is why the baseball fields are not kept up.
There are lighted tennis courts that get quite a bit of use.
There are also basketball courts which are very busy most of the time.
There is a large community center that is used by various organizations for classes and other activities. The center has a kitchen as well as tables and chairs and can be rented for private parties. Just contact the city of West Covina if interested. A lot of beautiful views from the top of this park as it is elevated which means that it gets cool there in the evening times.  A lot of parking as well. I have spent alot of time in this park with my wife and children creating thousands of great memories. I am sure if you take your family there you will create some nice memories as well!< /text></record>

Good overall.  Lots of rabbits!  My kids call this the rabbit park.  There are two levels of parking and the lower level has access to the lower level of the park where the rabbits are.  There are no shaded picnic tables though so you got to bring your own canopy if you want to go picnic or burn in the sun :)</Review>

This park is beautiful. There are rabbits that hang out in the back, and as long as you don't bother them it's very relaxing to see them hopping around and enjoying the grass. There's also basketball courts and a baseball diamond, as well as areas for picnics and kids to play. Overall a great party and I love visiting.< /Text>

It would have gotten 5 stars but there was a lot of glass on the floor. They were broken bottles from careless humans so my dog and I had to maneuver a lot. I guess a lot is an overstatement, it was maybe 2, 3 possibly 4 times but having to maneuver around broken glass once is too many times</review>

Nice park. Except you have to climb a lot of steps to get to the top and the playground is really small with no shade.< /Text>

<review>Nice park. Multiple basketball, tennis and baseball fields. Nice view, especially at night of the city. Great walking paths and playground for the kids. Parking is not the greatest, really small, especially on the weekends because of a makeshift church. Trying to play on the baseball fields can be hard at times because community football & softball league's take up the fields and get angry if you're in their way or on "their" fields. Pokémon Go players, there are only 2 Poké stops and one gym. Pokémon themselves are not as populated as preferred.<//review><name>Rudy Lugo<//name>< Pics>
