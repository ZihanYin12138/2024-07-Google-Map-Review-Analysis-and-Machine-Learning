<Review>Decent location. Weight machines are a bit dated, old models but they are maintained well and have good upkeep. This one is definitely one of the cleaner gyms I've been to. Overall a solid pick, though it would be nice if they had some newer/more contemporary weight machines.</Review><Rating>3<//Rating></record>

<review>If you like companies that have people enter private lots to shove their advertising flyers inside the roll-up window of your vehicle, then this is the right gym for you!

I found their flyer on the ground next to my vehicle with a good chunk missing. When I looked up, I found the rest of the flyer stuck inside the door panel of my vehicle. Now a piece of their flyer, placed there by a person who trespassed into a private lot, is now stuck inside my car.</review>< Pics>

<time>1568774953006< /time><Review>I feel like the customer service is particularly bad at this location. I have a single gym membership at another LA fitness. However, I play a league that includes me at the Vista LA fitness.  Each time I come in they try to charge me five dollars because I don’t have a multi club membership . Each time I have to prove that I have permission. It just seems to me like they should find out and inform the staff. Also, I don’t understand why they are rude about it. Tonight they told me I was wrong but that they let it go this time. I was not wrong, and once again I proved it to them.< /Review><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

<Response>None< /Response><username>E.A. Padilla</username><Review>As a long-time past and recently re-enlisted member to the Vista LA Fitness location, I was pleasantly surprised how easy and helpful Charlie and Zack were securing a guest pass for my friend who was visiting from Northern California.  I've belonged to many fitness centers around California (Sacramento, Redding, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, LA, Oakland, San Jose, Irvine and Oceanside).  Additionally, my past job involved a lot of traveling, so I've visited many fitness centers across the U.S.

The Vista location is great with all options available (racket ball, basketball, swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna, separate bike rooms for spin classes and a extra large mirrored room for aerobics with a wall of bags for kicking and boxing.  By far, this location is my favorite one.  Thanks LA Fitness in Vista, CA for a great place to work-out!!</Review>< Rating>

I have been going here for 10 years. Love this gym, love the people, the wide variety of classes rock, the pool is indoors heated & clean. LA FITNESS has helped my husband & I through car accidents & hard times with our health. I feel really fit & in great shape because of LA FITNESS....WE ARE TOTALLY GREATFUL THAT WE LIVE NEARBY....soon returning to France, but I will miss this gym.< /text>

<review>**BEWARE OF BETRIZ** I like this gym and the equipment however customer service is HORRIBLE! I’ve been a member seance 2013 and I have NEVER seen Beatriz R smile or greet any customer. She acts as if people owe her something. If I’m paying money to this place I believe I should be treated nice and with respect but Beatriz knows NOTHING about good customer service and everyone who joins this gym should BEWARE FOR BEATRIZ!!!</review><rating>1</rating><Date>1533685070615< /Date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I've been going there for almost 6 months now, I have seen changes in the staff a few times. I will say that the staff now is amazing!!! From the General Manager Beatrice to ALL the receptionists! Shay, Pamela, Yolva.... The Sales Manager is awesome as I didn't care for the previous one to be honest! One of the advantages of this location I noticed is that they are one of the only ones to have a hot steam room and a sauna. Plus, That location opens earlier than most in San Diego County and closes the latest (4 am to 11 pm- Monday through Thursday) Friday it still opens at 4 am and closes just one hour earlier.... I would recommend this location to anyone that lives close to Vista or cares about the steam room, and that may want to get an extra hour in! Amazing staff! The equipment is good enough for me to get my workout in :-)< /Review><user_name>Jonathan Gheorghin<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

By far the trashiest gym I've been to. Even had an old lady "trainer" kick me off a machine mid set, knowing I was still on the machine. There are plenty of other gyms nearby, don't go to this hole.< /review>

The staff is ok but the clientele at this gym is nasty, mostly because it's Vista.  I wonder sometimes if I'm at the gym inside of the prison by the looks and actions of most of the clientele. Not many girls go here it's mostly just males covered in tattoos.</Text><rating>3<//rating>< Time>

I've been with LA Fitness for 2 years I never had a problem until they put a new manager named Brandy she is the most rude person I have ever met she takes out her anger on people. My card didn't go through because I had changed banks and when I went in she didn't give me a chance to explain she just kicked me out like a dog. I have canceled my membership and now a member of 24 hour fitness they are very nice and friendly :).< /Text>

So far, nice people. The spa needs to be resurfaced, it's clean, it just looks dirty. I am concerned about the women's wet sauna. It smells moldy. I'm highly sensitive to mold, so I can't go in it. Other than this, the place looks clean, equipment is in good order and in using it almost every day.</Review>

I'd give this a solid 3.5 because the locker room needs to be updated. Otherwise it is your typical gym. The swimming pool, spa, sauna, and steam room are all nice also.< /Review>

Would leave your kids in a daycare where the person who is getting your info is giving you attitude, and treating you with no respect?  This is a big sign your kids are not going to have a good time. I normally go to the gym during the week and the ladies who are there are really nice and friendly! I decided to go on a Sunday morning for a spinning class, and the lady who was in the daycare she asked me to go back to the front desk because I didn't pay for my kids, and I said I will have to give you a phone number because they're in a different membership, and she said you can't bring your kids with a different membership, and I said yes I can because the membership belongs to my husband, and she said "you didn't say it was your husband". I gave her three time my husbands' phone number, and she said it didn't appear in the system, and I said why don't ask the other employee who was watching the other kids, she always help me during the week and we never had this issue before. She refused to do it and she asked me again for the phone number, and I said you know what i won't leave my kids with a person like you lady! I walk out with my kids.  As a parent it is important to leave your kids with someone who will be kind and show respect toward others, I enjoy work out, but if my kids will not be happy in a daycare, I will find other alternatives!!<//review>

The sales guy signed me up for a free intro personal training session without telling me the date.

Vista location - Rude manager, rude staff and if you forget your tag, you will have to provide a drivers license to get access to the gym even if they have your photograph on file. Are they running a gym or a bank vault?

The equipment is always sticky so you have to wipe it down before and after use. All in all a shabby depressing place to exercise.  My 3 year membership will be up for renewal in September - KEEP YOUR GYM.</Review>

<text>At La Fitness in San Marcos Ca,
Months ago I was harassed by a member name Ralph Winchell.  I reported him to staff on a number of times but nothing was done to stop it so I left.  But they still want my money just the same.  1 Corinthians chapter 6 clearly states that thieves nor liars will not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.  I advice anyone to stay away from such a business as La fitness.  If the owners and staff and trainers as well don't change their ways you all will spend the rest of your lives in HELL FOREVER AND EVER.< /text><time>1365935311744</time>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Their focus is very much on Strenght training, and in reguards to that they are very narow minded.  They do not value cardio or other forms of finess regiment very much. How ever the staff are very friendly and well educated in their specific field. They do have a pool and tread mills, but dont be surprised if they want to sell you a training package because you are not doing strength training.<//Text>< pictures>

We went for a trial arranged by the salesman Randy. The experience was an absolute disaster. The guy only wanted to close a deal with us, so he could get a commission; not only did he have any idea about he was doing, he also did it in a shady and touchless way, withholding information and playing weird tactics to make a sale (that of course, he ended up not making). Long story short, he made us paid for the free trial because we didn't one to sign up just yet! I still give a 2 stars because of the great Mat Pilates class. About the rest, facilities are old and not well taken care of. Worst customer service experience in my life, courtesy of this Randy guy.</text>

Weird layout but had everything you need plus some. Can't go wrong here except for your excuses... Get in #killit get out. Do your thing! Some equipment may be out dated but I like it like that, with the rust and the dents.< /review>

<Review>This review is for those that put customer's and their circumstance above rigid rules of the business. My daughter who was 16 at the time joined LA FITNESS hoping to get in shape in time to go back to school, she had been out of school for about a year and a half. She has Lupus and thought she could handle the gym. After her first free session with the trainer I knew she was not ready. She still wanted to try it out. She was working and was paying for the gym herself. Because I was not on her gym membership I reminded her that if she decided to quit she needed to cancel. She did not but she did tell me she had received an email asking for new banking information so she thought that her account had been canceled. Well it was not, and she was charged along with an overdraft charge. I called and talked to Beatrice she said there was nothing she could do other than cancel her membership. I talked to her for a bit and then was transferred to Charlie the floor manager. I asked him to also please remove the last charge and he said there was nothing he could do. I reminded him if he wanted to,  he could remove the charge but that would be showing grace. You see my daughter is saving up for a car and she messed up and did not cancel in time, and to be fair I too had not been on top of the whole thing, but again a business that actually cares about the customer bestows grace rather than care just about TAKING a 16 year olds money. My daughter had not gone back because her health did not allow it, but that did not matter. All that matters to LA FITNESS is taking her money fair and square. That's pretty sad but my daughter learned a valuable lesson that will follow her the rest of her life. Customer Service. She has already learned from working how to treat customers but now she is learning what a company that does not care about it's customers looks like. This company is called LA FITNE$$!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dc76a817be6667:0xf0c9a3763850eac5<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great facility, but beware...locker room theft runs rampant and neither corporate or local management care or will attempt to address. They care only about sales.</text>

< Review>
It was a nightmare for me with LA fitness at 92081 lately. At the first visit In Oct I told one of their representatives to open an account for mom for three months only and paid it all even with cash. He said "understood and welcome to LA fitness" with a smile. But actually the lease was still with recurring policy term with small font. I hadn't realized it until I saw a recurring charge in Dec. I went to their front desk to dispute the charge but was given a word that they can't do anything to refund the charge because the policy is the policy and there was no proof to defend what I say, and by the way the previous representative was left. What a political manner. The way LA fitness treats with the customers is very different from the other business/companies, and out of the scope people get used to.    I post the message for your information although most likely I can't do any thing to get back my loss.< /Review>

I've been a member of la fitness for 12 years and worked out at Vista for 3 years. The new management at Vista location are amazing!!!!!!. Brandy had been very helpful at numerous times and Bobby serrano the G.M on his review of being in prison for multiple d.u.I's???. I work in law at the courts and did research and has no prior records nor being imprison. I love my club at Vista and will continue telling coworkers and friends to join.. fyi no relationship with Bobby serrano because of the same last name.<//Review>< Pics>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>This gym is fantastic! I have been to about a  dozen of them and the layout here on the floor and in the locker room is by far da best. The staff are great people always have a smile and a greeting for you ,hellos and goodbyes are constant! its well maintained clean all round (seems always to me anyway). The showers,the mats ,the tiles the equipment...everything  always super super clean...I really appreciate this facility and am pretty lucky I get to get healthier and cleaner there as well. There is nothing wrong with this place to me! im a 57 year old man who complains alot but I haven't 1 damn negative thing to say about anyone or anything about the Vista LA Fitness which btw I go to nearly 4-5 times a week. I thank you. Sincerely,
I.M. Grateful.< /Text>< pics>

I keep getting telemarketing calls from this place. They call me and never respond when I say hello and then just hang up, and when I call back they say they did not call me but they have plenty of times. Their number is nearly spamming people it seems at this point.

Reply: I'm sure it's not as you are a salon from what I'm aware of. My concern is that someone is using your company name as a caller ID to get people to answer. I changed the review to 5 stars because I know it's not your fault but I wanted to make you were aware of it.< /review>

I ve seen James at Salon Kavi for over 3 years and I have to say he is the best! 3 years ago I had a decent short haircut but nothing exciting. I always wanted to grow the top hair longer but never had the patience and the right hair stylist to do so. Now with almost 50 I have the best hair cut of my life, thanks to James!< /Text>

< Review>
I love salon Kavi for many reasons but most off all I love my hairdresser Crystal because she is very joyful and professional. If I show her a picture of the haircut that I want I can be sure that she will do the exact same thing. Usually when I just had an haircut I don't like the way that the hairdresser style my hair except with Crystal! Also I always have a warm welcome when I arrive at the salon and I love the fact that I receive a text message as a reminder the day of the appointment. Very professional staff and relaxing place, you should try it 😉<//Review>

<review>Piera Rivasplata is the best. Does a great job with color and understands her clients perfectly. She is a pro! Highly recommend her. I get so many compliments on my hair color and she's been my stylist for 15+ years.

<Text>Salon KAVI is welcoming, great space cool and modern.  I had a Deva curly hair cut by Karla which was outstanding.    I was shown how to do my hair at home, and what products to use.   Very happy.  Am returning this week to have my color done.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Crystal was amazing! My hair was long, wompy, and in need of some TLC. Crystal helped me narrow down a style based on some images I provided. Afterwards she helped answer my questions in regards of how to style my new short style. I highly recommend going to her! <3<//Text>

<text>Awful. She didn't do what we talked about. Was charged for something I didn't want. Then to top it off, I had to blow dry my own hair. When I called to speak with a manger, I was told I would get a call back that day. I never did, I had to call back 2 days later . Will never go back. I wouldn't even give this place 1 star.<//text><GmapID>0x808f9ee0320e342f:0x9d045240a7e732ec<//GmapID><resp>None<//resp>< Date>

<Review>I work at Louis Vuitton and two of my customers recommended Salon Kavi!! I love their cuts and color and asked them where they go to. I really like Salon Kavi. It was such a coincidence. I finally made an appointment with them. Victoria gave my hair a treatment and a semi permanent color. I also had a consultation with Karla for a cut. Everyone was very attentive.  I really enjoyed my time there.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The atmosphere is great and very relaxing, I've been to many salons where I feel stressed during my cut and I couldn't enjoy my experience. Ask for Ricky!</review>

Didn't like the hair cut. Also, cash tips only which is dumb and a disservice to the stylist.<//review>

<Review>I have been patronizing Salon Kavi (previously Stilo Salon) for almost 3 years. I see Victoria, who is one of the owners, for my highlights/lowlights. I see Samira for my cuts. I can not recommend them highly enough! The check in experience and front desk staff are pleasant and professional. I am always offered a smock and my choice of beverages. Once in the chair, additional beverages and a variety of magazines are always available during the service. As has been my experience at all salons, the price of the cut includes the blow-dry and style, and the color does not. Kavi does offer a do-it-yourself blow dry bar stocked with every product and tool imaginable at no additional charge.</Review></record></dataset><record>

This place is fantastic!  I've been to my fair share of nail places and this place by far has  exceeded my expectations!!  I took my sister in law for her birthday to get her toes done and Kristie just showered her with kindness and made sure she got the attention she deserved.  My girl, Tammy, was just as fantastic!!  The customer service is over the top!  I think I found my nail place for life 😍< /Review>

My favorite nail place.  Kristi and all of her employees are courteous and VERY service oriented.  When I first went there I had a fungus under two toes that had been injured.  No other nail person had helped me get the healing I needed.  Kristi took time with me to show me what to do.
I am almost at the end of the treatment and so grateful she took time to help me.</Review>

<text>Good place. The staff was extra nice.. but they are a little over priced
. A set of pink n white nails cost 45... I've been to other places that charge anywhere from 25-35 but never 45. A basic pedicure is 25 as well.<//text><UserId.>116542100549058870404< /UserId.><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Good quality manicure and pedicure, but I felt very ignored by the staff who were more busy entertaining themselves than giving good service to the customer. It would have been nice to be offered a glass of water or cup of tea<//text>

Man O man. The most professional and friendliness staff I have ever met in my life. So down to earth and relaxing, the most tranquil nail salon in Sacramento. This salon deserves more than 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐. Try the Supreme pedicure. They treated my daughter and like we've known each other for years. And Kristie the owner was very sweet and kind. I recommend Hanna for anything and everything she was the best and a joy to be around.<//text>

<text>I have been coming to see Kristy for a year now. I absolutely love this place. The are extremely clean and take pride in what they do. Most importantly, they treat me as if I'm the only client there, no rushing that I have experienced in other salons when they get busy. I highly recommend Kristy and her crew. :)<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x809adc3eff30e3a9:0xb615d90f57519069< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I absolutely adore kristy! I have never had any of the other girls but I am sure they’re just as good. She takes her time with pedicures, never ever rushed she actually CLEANS them. Same goes for my eyebrows I was struggling with shape and thickness for a long time she definitely helped out a great deal and she took her time with them as well. Has great advice and is honest as well. Honestly,  I won’t go anywhere else. I see the bad comments and I just couldn’t believe it. 10 our of 5!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Review>Took my fiancee there to get her acrylics. Even called ahead. Was told 25$ got charged more. They didnt understand our questions and she said that she was in pain while the guy was shaping her nail. I could tell from her facial expressions that she was telling the truth. He didn't do anything about it. Terrible experience. Never coming back! Kicked out the previous costumers before they were even done to get us serviced<//Review>< userid>

<Text>The affordable eyebrow waxing service is above even my high standards, & is the only place I'll let touch our eyebrows. They're well worth the drive from Natomas. Oh did I mention it was only $10? I highly recommend calling ahead to make an appt, but it's not mandatory. Just be prepared to wait if you do choose to just walk-in without making an appt. While the price is low, but the quality of service provided is the opposite!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

< review>
My cousin and I came from Michigan for her son's wedding. She needed her nails touched up from growing too fast. I found Kristy's online, saw they had great reviews and prayed they could fit us in. They were beyond awesome! We ended up showing up 30 minutes early to the appointment and they were able to start on her almost right away! They touched up her acrylics and even had the same OPI red my cousin had on! They even had the perfect Zoya neutral grey that I had on! The staff was so friendly and Kristy herself is a master multitasker! She was taking appointments, doing my nails and chatting with my cousin and I without missing a beat! Best manicure experience ever, even in Michigan! The other review was right they deserve more than 5 stars!!!!!!< /review>

<Review>Never ever will I refer anybody to this place. I walk in and go and sit down to get my gel fill manicure. They had poor color choices and when I asked about designs or other options the lady yelled at me said no this is all we have. Then in the middle of my manicure I get asked to move to the pedicure station where I ask how much for the manicure and pedicure. The lady quoted me at $68 but when I totaled the items from the menu I should have only been charged 50. I told her that based on her prices I should have only been getting charged 50 and she kept coming up with excuses on why she was charging me more. Clearly it said for each broken nail it was $3 each she was trying to tell me it was $5 each for a gel fill it was $19 but she said it was a different gel powder so she had to charge me $25 it was just b*******. Nope, sorry. I don't play that.</Review>< Response>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Just went to try Double Shot Cafe on 4587 Mission. They have very friendly staff. I am disappointed with their quality and selection of their product though. While I was waiting for my beverage I spotted mold on their banana bread that's kept right next to unpacked cookies. I let the staff know. At first they tried to explain away the mold by saying that it was "the organic stuff."  She's correct that mold is organic. I had to physically point it out the moldy corners to the at lady at the register. She then delegated for her colleague to take away the banana cakes. The co-worker said she didn't see anything wrong with them and I again had to show her the corners of the banana cakes. They took away the banana bread but still kept the unpacked cookies that were near the mold in stock.
I was in for a second disappointment when I received my beverage finally. I got an Horchata Latte Frappuccino. It was a super super sweet, greasy and absurdly chunky ice mess. There were huge chunks of ice that got stuck in the straw right away. The super saccharine greasy drink was a huge disappointment for the $4.25. After the first few gross sips I threw it away fearing the worse since such a new business is already selling moldy food.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>One of the best coffee shops on the block. They get their beans freshly roasted every week!

I never drink dark coffee, but they had an amazing one here. No acids or residual taste  I also tried their latte with Oatmilk (thanks for having it available) and it was very delicious. I'll be back for sure.<//text>< pictures>

Ordered a hazelnut coffee (medium) for $5. What I got was a Tarino flavoring sugary hot mess. To be honest a Starbucks double shot is almost the same amount and even cheaper (and the it's even not as sweet tasting either which is surprising).

Would rather go to Cafe Guatamatelco down the street to spend the same amount of money on a superior product.<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>This is a hip little coffee shop amongst a bustling street of other retail businesses. But inside you can cozy up with a hot cup of tea (or my favorite, the prepackaged extra large carton of coconut water) and play some board games. Jenga is extra fun because it's generally quiet so if you lose and make it fall, you feel more self-conscious. More incentive to win! If you win or lose, I recommend the apple tart pastry. If you're okay walking a bit, I've trekked from Glen Park BART through the neighborhood; you pass by some cool views over the hills too.< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

The price of their coffee is great and better than Peets or Starbucks. It's a family owned coffee shop with a very large selection of coffee or tea drinks. My favorite is their hot chocolate Mexican take with whipped cream.< /review>

<review>Not only did I get a stale bagel after the barista conveniently gave my order to her friend, but also got the sweetest most disgusting latte, the lavender is pure sugar and no lavender. I waited over 15 minutes and was the second person in, but everyone that came in was helped before me.  Service was awful. I paid so much for this terrible service and the barista didn't even apologize.< /review></record>

Their latte selections are creative: lavender, nutella, horchata, etc. Double Shot is a welcome addition to our neighborhood.</review>

<Text>I have been a loyal customer to this company and have even referred family and friends. After this experience I will never support this company again. They do NOT uphold to their customer satisfaction policy or help resolve issues. I bought $300 worth of hair. The care tips hair tag states that hair can be colored, permed and bleached. It also states to test hair because hair may react differently. I colored 2 bundles of hair(without bleach) which came out perfectly fine. The 3rd bundle did not not take well to the color and a few strands and the ends were shriveled up. I called immediately as advised to let them know I was not satisfied with the product. One employee explained that They would exchange the bundle or give me 30% off. After making a claim they told me that they stood by their hair and would not take responsibility. I then went into the store and talked to the manager which was not willing to help resolve the issue. He was so unwilling to help that he started acting like he didn’t understand and kept shrugging his shoulders.

For their mission goal to be “Your satisfaction is our final goal. If not, please contact us instantly, we will resolve the problem ASAP”, and not help to resolve the issue is very frustrating. Will not buy or refer anyone here again.<//Text>< gmapID>

<text>This was the worst hair store that I have ever been to. The ladies who work in there were terribly rude and catty.  I literally stood around and had to pratcically beg for help. It was like they weren't interested in helping me. They all ignored me and rolled their eyes at me when I tried to talk to them. They just stared at me. For this to be a wig store they had no wigs for sale, just short, dry, matted bundles and display wigs that look synthetic. It was a very bizarre experience. Overall terrible customer service and terrible hair. Wow .</text>< Pictures>

By far the worst quality hair I have ever beheld. Bought a bundle of what they called their best quality hair (10a). One day later I washed it as I always do, and I've never seen that much hair shed from a bundle in my life. Short hairs, long hairs, all the above were coming out in bulk each time I combed my fingers through. I knew there would be an issue when I spoke to the 2 ladies behind the counter, who had no idea what Brazilian hair really was. Would never return here ever and it is a wonder how they are still open.</review>

< Review>
The young ladies was very helpful with helping me make my in-store purchase.. After I informed them of my online experience with purchasing a wig they was very sympathetic to my needs and suggested that I do in store purchases from now on.. which I will! I even found the unit cheaper in store and very beautiful to the eye! U-Nice hair is everything. My free items 2pks of facemasks a tote bag and U-Nice lashes plus 2 headbands. As you can see the hair is 14in curly</Review>

Paid for my order through Paypal and the company took 2 payments. Having to dispute the chargers because Unice is not refunding. I have documentation so I will get my money back but super inconvenience. I would not recommend this place. Shop around there are others that will provide good customer service.</Text>

I absolutely love this hair; shipping was fast I ordered my hair and it came within 4 days. I had great communication with the seller, they contacted me throughout the whole process to make sure everything was fine. The hair is so soft and has an amazing curl pattern also has no odor so I didn’t need to wash it ; The bundles are thick and the hair  length is true..  it  also came with a free pack of lashes. Thank you I’m very satisfied and I highly recommend this to everyone you won’t be disappointed.</Text>

The hair is amazing. It is very soft and thick. The closure is thick which surprised me because I have bought different hairs from other companies and they where thin. I would recommend this to everyone. I would definitely buy again!< /review>

<Review>When I first got the closure I messaged the seller and told her the piece had a lot of short hairs. She responded and said that it's just extra hair added to make the closure look a little more full. Me trying to be understanding I kept the closure and took a partial refund as an apology. I got my closure installed March 30th ... I just took my hair out yesterday being May 15th and this is what my closure looks like  (Keep in mind my bundles DID NOT COME FROM UNICE & THEY STILL LOOK FULL AND AMAZING) I was extremely upset because I've purchased many closures before and they NEVER look like this in a month. AGAIN I CONTACTED The seller to inform her of this & she's asking me all types of questions like " how do I care for my hair " telling me " this has never happened before " blaah blaah blaah . I'm pretty upset about it all . But it was a honestly a lesson learned ! I'll NEVER buy another closure from them PERIOD !!!! I'd recommend you ladies not to either</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9AY0PMWLqFXRTRBpuD7MNKE_XxTUkVVlpaFg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzmSwrMqoiBKl1Mo34168gAofl695WLo1V66s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIpnWEt-yCAzwCY16ni9qDZ89cPpX7cog8Hrs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORAXRSpIApGrtb1xKMhyD8GcdP8xuhCKrBr10=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

My experience with this hair company was absolutely amazing. I have the 22,24,26,26 of Peruvian water wave and it is beautiful. Shipping was very fast . The Bundles are full and true to length and the hair is extremely soft. I bleached all 4 bundles 3 different shades of blonde and the hair is still beautiful  the curls still have their definition and the hair is not dry and brittle. It’s very manageable I use a spray bottle with water and  a little leave in conditioner and that’s all I need. I would definitely purchase hair from this hair company again.</text>

I liked the store, even though they didn't carry the wig I wanted that was on their website. The sales associate was very friendly and knowledgeable and gave a novice like, me some great suggestions. I will continue to shop with Unice.< /Review>

I’ve been ordering UNice Hair since 2017, and I absolutely looooooooove the quality of their hair! It’s super affordable, full, doesn’t tangle or shed much, & the hair can be reused over and over again! I’ve also made wigs out of my old bundles🙌🏾.  I’ve purchased lace closures from UNice and the quality is also great! I do not have any complaints, & will continue to order from UNice!! Thank you for great customer service, great quality & affordable bundles!!</Review>

<Review>hair quality if not pleasing after first wash.  the hair is sown on the wig the wrong direction and that makes it very difficult to lay flat.  Also, the wig has loads of short hair pieces in the lace the entire lace front area so it makes it hard to lay the hair flat.

Please know the lace is grey and dying helped a bit but not enough to match.  the prices online are better than what you receive in the store.  I asked for a full lace but was given a 360 which is exactly what I did not want....</Review>< gmap_id>

Unice hair are in good quality, they are soft and smooth. Their hair which I used has last for 1year and a half. Highly recommended.< /review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>BAD PRODUCT & BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! I had given my business to this company for a little over three years. I  purchased bundles for myself as well as my teenage daughter, needless to say I spent quite a bit of money during that time. Towards the end of that three years, I noticed that the product quality had become very poor. Each order  ( and I would routinely order new bundles every 3 to 4 months for myself and my daughter )  would not only have a strong chemical order but a rough, damaged feel...as if the hair had been over processed. And the lace frontal‘s became more and more sparse... in some areas it looked like bald patches. When I brought this to the attention of the company, initially they tried to pacify me with a 3% discount on my next purchase. When I asked not to be pacified, as this can easily be obtained by any customer going on their website and that it’s not about the money but the integrity of the company,  they apologized explaining that they had “new employees” and offered a 15% discount on my next purchase. However, when I went to order again several months later and redeem  the discount, they pretended not know what I was talking about. So, I screenshot the emails and text messages and all of the correspondences...as well as pictures of the poor quality product I had received and they STILL refused to honor their word.... repeatedly asking to re-send the correspondences again and again. Finally, I explained to them that in my opinion, the company lacks honor and integrity and I will be taking my business elsewhere ...which I did.  In January 2018 I started doing business with Peerless. So far I am completely satisfied with the packaging, the delivery time and definitely the product! Their bundles are full, lush and worth every penny!!! Yes... they are a little more expensive than Unice... but SOOOO worth it!!!   I purchased four bundles of the kinky Jerry curl and a lace closure and have been reusing it since January! I get compliments every day... it’s still extremely full, luscious and beautiful!!!... people can’t believe I’ve been wearing it and reusing it since January...but it’s true. 😊< /review>< Pictures>

It saddens me to see how many people lie about how great UNICE hair is, this was the worst hair I have every purchase, Also they are paying YouTube influencer to advertise their hair and for a check they are lying 🤥. After a 4 day installation the hair began to matte, tangle and shed like dog 🐕 hair the hair is an embarrassment. I wish I could upload the hair. I spent 175.00 on this hair. My hair of choice was the Brazilian body wave 3 bundles of 24 inches and they said they never receive complaints on their hair. I will never purchase their hair again</Text>

I'm very disappointed with Unice hair. Not only were the bundles short but they were extremely small. I usually purchase hair from Peerless who has amazing hair. However, after viewing several raving reviews about Unice, I thought I'd give them a try.I'll need to order more hair in order to complete a new unit. Will not order from them again.< /Text>

My bundles were not true to length and very very small. It was almost like I got 2ounce bundles and I got 4 bundles of Brazilian deep wavy hair and 4 wasn't enough. I usually get straight Brazilian hair and they're always true to length and very full I was very dissatisfied with unice.<//text>

The hair I received was trash!!
Nothing even close to the pic.
I ordered the 12" wavy bob 19.90
Says was Brazilian hair...TRASH.
I though it away! So if you're thinking about it...DON'T, DO IT.  It's from China...that says it all!!<//Review>

<Text>On three separate occasions this placed has been closed with a be right back sign stating 12:15pm and it's 12:40 pm with door still locked. On another visit they didn't even put up a "be right back sign". Something has got to change.< /Text><gmapID>0x80c2b561ea9e3fff:0xdaacbb13a1b6e754< /gmapID>< date>

Unfortunately, I was rushed with placing my order, I asked what happened to the $5 for any two footlong, and the cashier told me "we don't do that anymore" I proceeded to ask her why and she just scanned my card and walked away. I didn't even get my receipt.< /Text>

I had a very bad experience at this location with one of the servers I was simply asking the lady  (jessica) about something on the menu board her response to me was "all you have to do is read" first of all I'm not dumb so I asked her was she having a good day because she was so rude from the start so I decided not to have her serve me I let the couple behind me go she treated them very well so I said oh so you seem to be prejudice because I am African American and they were Caucasians the other server ( Ms. Simental) apologized for her behavior and said she'll take care of me as soon as she finish with the other people she was so nice she gave me information to contact the manager (Linda) after 4 pm but when I call she's never in this incident happened 7/11/17 @ 1:56 pm<//Review>

<Text>Staff ignored us and carried on preparing for the lunch trade.  Even when we asked if we could be served...the lady was sarcastic and rude. No customer service skills were present in this store. Hopefully managers will try to improve/replace this person.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

A hidden gem. You would never know from the outside how warm and cozy this place is. And the sushi portions are huge and spectacular. Sit at the bar and watch the chefs work.<//Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>This place used to be good with their food quality and portions, as well as their customer service; however they truly disappointed us tonight. Fish was very smelly and obviously spiced up to mask the taste and smell. The front end gentleman was disrespectful and did not even bother to give us chopsticks!
We truly have been a supporter of small business during these difficult times, and love to see them thrive, however I do not believe SushiHolic appreciate it's customers and their support. They certainly have lost our support.  STRONGLY recommend Taki sushi 🍣 ! They still seem to appreciate and value their customer.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Excellent food always!!!
Although I made a pick up order and one of the waitress was very rude at the pick up time. Then I had to go back to get chopsticks because I forgot to ask and she very rudely told me to pay attention on the sign notes that was saying that customers have to ask for utensils. It was not the first time that she was rude to attend.<//Text>< Pictures>

Ordered fish that said fresh but unfortunately it was quite frozen and yes, smelly. I couldn’t eat it. Service was not great and had to get up myself to get things.</Review>

I have to keep this short and sweet due to timing, but hands down our favorite sushi place in Marin. I have loved everything I've had so far and been here with friends, family or dates over 20 times now. Super friendly and kid friendly too! Usually busy since the paper wrote them up, but worth the wait!!

Pics attached of tonight's yumminess.

My Must haves every time:
-Passion roll
-Alaskan roll or sweet Alaskan
-Saba nigiri
-Hot mama
-Futomaki<//review>

We were hesitant to try this for a while because the corny name "Sushiholic" made me think it was an Americanized fast food version of sushi. I'm glad we tried it out because we've been here many times and it's easily the best sushi in Novato. Great service and a cozy, friendly atmosphere.</Review>

It's always two ladies that take care of the floor. While they used to be warm and welcoming, they've become rude and harsh. The quality of their food is slipping as well. The teriyaki chicken seems to be fattier each time we order it. There was a time or two where it was even undercooked. We usually get their California rolls as well, as they were our favorite. But they're coming out poorly put together.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x8085bcbf260f97bf:0x3ffa65d445b4d667< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Sushi Holic in Vintage Way Novato ,CA is a very nice place to have lunch or dinner. The ambiance is mellow😘, and the aroma of Japanese cuisine lingers in the air makes you feel at home 👍😘 and ready for a great meal .
The service was good and the food is fantastic👍😘👍 . All the fish is so fresh and prepared skillfully , and cut into perfection.  The miso soup is so good too. Price is very  reasonable for a great meal. I also love their green tea ice cream. It sealed your tastebuds  from having a great meal. 👍😘🌷😘👍Check it out!🍸😘👍<//Text>

<review>Sushi Holic is amazing. The best sushi restaurant in Marin County. The staff is very friendly and the sushi chefs full of experience and knowledge in this field. The fish is super fresh and the taste is amazing. One of the dishes I like the most is chefs choice. I can go on and on about this sushi restaurant. I think is one the best sushi places in the Bay Area. You are going to love it. I highly recommended this place.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Lets start by saying the sushi is/was good.

Everything other than that was pretty bad.

I ordered several items for my family and I on a Monday afternoon for pickup. Keep in mind that we are over 6 weeks into the Covid pandemic of '20 and when I went there to pick up it was chaos. There was a SUPER-LONG wait due to the un-organized nature of the 2 people putting orders together. They were operating as 2 expo's/runners and 1 was more of a manager type but it was pretty bad how they were operating that day.

It was like they've never worked together during a rush.

One patron in line behind me struck up a conversation with another and I recall her saying "This is funny to watch but at the same time really not funny. I want to go back there and help them." Ouch lol.

One of the runners was also having a hard time processing payments through their POS system. My mind is blown right now.

On a positive note, the Sushi chef's were rockin'. They were doing their part and pumping out orders. Nice work fellas!

One of the most unfortunate things is that we ordered Ramen for my son. This was by far the worst Ramen I've ever had. I'm not saying I'm a connoisseur but I've been eating ramen my whole life, traveled to several asian countries and it's safe to say that I love all type of ramen. This was bad.

The noodles were all mush due in part to the long wait. the broth was waaaay to salty and didnt really have much flavor.

I'll give it another shot but I'll try off hours next time.<//Review>

One of the better sushi restaurants in Marin County. Excellent quality. Wonderful variety of sushi and traditional Japanese dishes excellent tempura. Vegetarian choices as well. Service can be a little slow but that's what you get cuz the place is always packed!</review>

Our favorite sushi bar in Novato. Possibly the best Sushi in Marin. I've been a sushi fan in Marin since 1982, and this place has been our favorite since it opened. Huge slices of fish. You won't leave hungry!<//review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><text>The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere and it was clean. I ordered a green salad and a spider roll. The green salad was fresh and a really good portion size. So far so good. Then the spider roll came. First it was the size of half a roll and it was really dry. I could hardly swallow it. Maybe too much rice and not enough ingredients, maybe rice was dry, I don’t know but I won’t order it again and probably won’t go back.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Decent. Sushi is fresh. A large collection of rolls. Nothing particularly new. A fair selection of bento and udon, if you want it. Service is friendly and good. Clean interior. I would give this a 4, but there is steep competition in the SF Bay Area for great sushi restaurants.< /review>

The workers here are so racist!! Made me and my wife so uncomfortable. We are of color and they took forever to give us out order and gave our food to thr guests next to us. I will never go to support a restaurant that doesn't support races of all types. I don't care how good your food is. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect!!!< /text>

<review>Might very well be the best Sushi I've ever had period!! Fresh, soft, sweet with a choice of white or whole grain rice.

Not only did they have your standard menu of Sushi, but they had the very hard to find buttery and sweet Tuna, Albacore, Yellow Tail and Salmon bellies (Toro).

I also tried grilled calamari which was both filling and delicious!!!!!

Well trained and authentic Sushi chefs with top notch customer service.

I'm from Chico CA so this is truly an unbiased review.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>The food is great and fish is really fresh. All of the staff care and are lovely people who work professionally. The only thing is trying to navigate the menu. You could accidentally order food thinking it's a big meal, but in reality it will give you small portions and you end up spending $100. For example if you get there $30 chefs choice sashimi and one special roll to feed two people, probability was that you guys may not like all the fish on there and the roll is already half going to you and the person you're sharing it with. The place is still amazing! This was just one of my past experiences.< /Text>< userid>

Honestly, I was skeptical of the food quality and authenticity because of the name.  Gave it a chance because a friend recommended this place, and glad we did.
Great service and food!  Ordered the fried eggplant appetizer, rainbow roll, and salmon sashimi meal to share with my partner.  A lady who worked there went around making sure every customer was satisfied with their food/experience.  She even brought us an extra bowl of rice (on the house) when she noticed we were sharing the bowl of rice that came with the meal!  First time I've seen a restaurant in the bay area give out free rice! (Rice is included with non-noodle entrees at Asian restaurants where I'm from-- it's ridiculous that it's custom to buy individual bowls of rice here!)

We will be back again for another sushi date!< /text>

Sushi was great, but the service was slow. The day I went it was not busy, but it took them 15mins or so to come get our order.<//Review>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>The sashimi lunch that i ordered looked OK, but tasted foul. Even the salmon and hemachi (usually mild tasting) had a strong walrus vomit flavors. I've been here a bunch, and, until now, have always been impressed with the food. But the fish they served was not fresh enough to be served raw -- for flavor, if not for safety. I'm seriously wondering if I'm going to get food poisoning or a parasite from this meal. I guess i will not be coming back :-( hopefully i won't be in the ER later< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x8085bcbf260f97bf:0x3ffa65d445b4d667< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Response>None< /Response><date>1611244967327</date><Text>This is really a nice shopping center. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because,  if they have disabled access to the upper shops and businesses, there is no standout signage to point you in the direction of where it is. Also, the walkways, though wide enough, are in places obstructed slightly. Due to some of the merchants taking up that space with some of their merchandise. Other than that there are a nice mix of shops and professional businesses to choose from.< /Text>< GmapID>

Conveniently located away from the massive malls. Loaded with speciality stores. Lots of parking. Eateries are all around you. Some chain stores, mostly more local shops with friendlier staff to greet you and make you feel welcome<//Text>

Always busy with shoppers when I come through. Love the older shopkeepers who have the brick and mortor feel and look. Clean parking lot and sidewalks.< /Review>

eclectic collection of businesses.  A wonderful toy/games store that is local and tries very hard to carry what you ask them to.  Free giftwraps is included as well as suggestions for that "hard to buy" kid.  Several homegoods stores, shoe stores, and a wonderful store called "The Nest", I have no idea what they sell, but they have a large number of birds in their front window raising young...hence the name and definitely worth a visit.<//Text>

Ask Jake for any questions you may have! My friend and I were in town visiting family and came in on a Sunday with major car issue. Knowing pretty well there wouldn’t be any mechanics open, we were hoping to get advice on where to go for help and their employee(Jake) offered to look up the parts our car needed and fix it on his lunch break. He fixed it up right away and did a great job for us to make the 5 hour drive back home the same day. We would’ve been stuck without him! Great service!</review>

Me and my wife Naudia we're stranded in bishop California our Harley Davidson needed a starter relay they personally pulled out the stops they provided tools, battery charge, nuts bolts, flash light and an attendants own personal 15 amp fuses at no cost to us even though they unfortunately did not possess the starter relay for my bike. Their service is under parallel to any I've ever experienced in my past of customer service! I'm 48 been there and done that all over the continental US never had I been treated with such respect,support & home town kindness. Bishop California's O'Reilly Auto parts is by far the most helpful,respectful team in all the many auto parts stores I've shopped. You guys ROCK orally the awesome work.
Me and Naudia as well as our beautiful Harley THANK YOU.< /review>

<review>So my brother Jeff texted this to me today. Thank God they’re safe. I wanted to share what happened and say how grateful we are for good people out there. Thank you, Oreilly’s!...

................................................................................

“Well, we could’ve been killed last night on “pitch black” Hwy 395. Dad’s alternator died at 1:30am last night while we were driving those 2 lane highways. Lucky for us there was a place to pull over. We called AAA and they towed us 60 miles to Bishop. Went to bed at 3:30 woke up this morning and changed out the alternator and back on the road.
The guys at the auto parts store even loaned us all the tools. They even opened a new package of sockets for us to use and didn’t charge us.  So cool of them.</review>< pictures>

I jumped into my car and my battery was dead.  I borrowed jumper cables and my next door game me a jump.  I drove my car around for 15 mins.  I drove into the O'Reilly Auto parts and ask do you still test batteries for free.  The answer was yes, he got the tester, told me turn my car off.  I never thought what if it doesn't start, he smiled and said I will give you a jump.  After receiving the test he said I definitely need a new battery.  The one in my car is four years old. I have a great mechanic so when I get paid at the end of the month I will have him buy me a battery and install it for me  I have tripple A, so if doesn't start guess who I'm gonna call for for a jump. O'Reilly Auto Parts store has a reliable mechanic, fast and friendly service.  They help you with your car no matter what gender you are they never ever take advantage of you.</review>

Clean parts store with nice friendly staff.  Since this is a chain location they have all the standard Oreilly merchandise, and can locate parts in that network.  No complaints about this location.  Also the management worked hard to personally help me locate out of stock parts.< /text>

<Text>They got this dumm girl brown skin black hair she might be native wich it explains how bad she was in knowing nothing about cars. I was dissapointed to know she dont even know anything about oils nore filters. Gave me the wrong ones charging me over $40 plus for and oil quite frankly she didnt wanna work there. She had the worst attitude. Thanks to a friendly #459968 male cashier i was able to take home the right oil and filter. Why does oreilly hire this kind of people.<//Text><rating>1<//rating><pictures>None</pictures><user_id>112287583561638052177< /user_id>< Time>

This store is terribel. Don;t give them your money.
Spent a ton of time on the phone ordering parts for following day pick-up. Guy on phone that was not helpful at all told me he had the parts and they would be there.
Well... guess what.... went down to get parts.... he had not pulled them nor was there any record I called and ordered parts. This place sucks!!!!!!!!
People are not responsible for anything. Typical freakin California employees. I'm going all the way up the chain on this one. This BS is not excetable... people should lose their jobs for sure. idiots.< /Text>

Cheap tools with a poor selection but big selection of auto parts. Absolutely the worst customer service in Bishop ! You can hear four or more guys B/s-ing behind the racks with nobody assisting customers.

I took a wheel bearing in from a trailer. The person behind the counter tried to sell me the wrong size bearing, saying, "This what everybody else uses!" I asked for a set of calipers & measured the ID of the bearing he brought out; it was 1/16th of an inch larger!?! I went home and located the correct bearing online, O'reilly's website stated  this store had four in stock.

Don't get me wrong, there are two maybe three knowledgeable & helpful employees, but the rest are worthless.< /Review>

A huge shout out to the everyone at Economy Auto.  Had my car worked on less than 6 months ago at another location and suddenly started having the same exact problems.  Took the car to Economy Auto and they fixed it all for less than half of what I originally paid.
The employees are all very personable.  Makes you feel like you're talking with friends.  They explained everything they checked, gave an honest estimate and did the work quickly.
Finding an honest mechanic with integrity is a challenge these days.  The people at Economy Auto definitely have both so I would highly recommend them to anyone that needs to have their car serviced.
Thanks for getting us back on the road!< /Text>

<Review>I have been going to Economy Auto Center for probably six years, they were recommended to me from a co-worker! You will never find more honest mechanics then the owner and his employees. Nowadays I wouldn't trust my car to anybody else, it's very hard to find an ethical good mechanic ... and Econo has all of that! As a senior Woman by myself it's very reassuring to know that I will never be taken advantage of or lied to like I have at some dealerships. Their prices are better than reasonable oh, and I would recommend this repair shop to anybody!<//Review>< Pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Well where do i start...Took our vehicle in for some work, and 4 days later our differential was bone dry - with absolutely no signs of a leak. After speaking with 3 different tech's all agreed it must have been drained accidentally - interestingly enough the owner of economy auto agreed. However his perspective was that even though they did the work it was not them. In fact he offered an explanation "That maybe an enemy of ours drained it in the street" - "I responded this feels more likely than your oil change guy draining by accident - who was under my car 4 days ago?

To be candid I didn't expected the owner to take responsibility - However being a business owner i was hoping we could find a common ground. Maybe I pay for the new differential and they install etc.

Instead I was stonewalled and left to pay a $3,000 bill by myself because of their incompetence - for those of you that don't know - a differential should last the life of your vehicle never needing a replacement.

Well, sad to see another dishonest man incapable of doing the right thing.

Cheers!</Review>< pictures>

<Review>I entered the front doors and was pleasantly pleased and very surprised. I learned that there are 120 different independently owned businesses within this indoor plaza. Inside I saw restaurants, shoe stores, woman and men clothing stores, a cobbler, a tanner, a game area, health stores, children clothing stores, furniture stores and more. I could not get to every store so I will return. This may become my go to marketplace.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Very sad to see this location so empty and so many shops closed for good.   You can still find quite a few things but not like it used to be,  not 50% what it used to be unfortunately.  📒✍< /review>

<text>Great stuff to buy especially if you are looking for Mexican shoes. Bought some shoes for my niece and they have lasted her a long time. Look for Basulto’s family shoes if you are looking for quality Mexican shoes and for a good price too.<//text>< pics>

<text>I can't speak on the other stores but I can say that this indoor swap meet has one of the best power tool and accessory shops I have ever seen in LA.

Yeah prices are negotiable but they're usually so fair that I don't even bother.

Also, being cash, everything here is cash only.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>
