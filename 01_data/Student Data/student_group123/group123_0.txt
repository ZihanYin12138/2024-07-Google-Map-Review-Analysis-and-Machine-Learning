If I could give a 0 I would. I purchased a interactive dog ball from them. Not only did it not work as described, it took almost 8 weeks to come. They state it doesn’t get stuck. Well on my first try it gets stuck under my kitchen cabinets. I reached out for a return immediately and was told it was past the 30 day return policy. I explained that I just received it and agreed to consult their vendor. After several back and fourth exchanges they refused to except a return. Do not buy from them as they do do stand behind their product’s!!!!< /text>

<time>1603587903884< /time><Rating>3</Rating><review>We ordered the AI supported ActiGun (massage gun) on StackSocial during a sale. It turned out that we got a used one (I am assuming it is a used one because the box is totally different from what we ordered, also the box was broken and unprofessionally packed). Also, the model we got is at least $50 cheaper from the one we ordered and paid for.
I contacted their support center, and their employee Anne was really helpful and answered within a day.
She contacted the vendor who stated that we are wrong and we got the correct gun just the cover is old (for whatever reason).

I insisted on an exchange. It was a month ago. Pure Anne is still trying to reach out to them but the vendor hasn't responded neither her nor my email. I appreciate her effort! She has been really conscientious.

We ordered courses as well, which we got without a problem, but because we ordered the ActiGun and courses together, they did not apply the discount to our courses. So we would have been better off with ordering everything separately and saving a lot of money.
I'm a bit disappointed. I am hesitant to order from them again.<//review>< pictures>

Fantastic range of courses on IT at great prices. They've got loads of free courses on Programming, Management, Security and Certification plus many products offering unlimited and lifetime access from as little as $39.
Not only that but if you live outside the US you can set up a US forwarding postal address and have a look at their range of electrical and electronics at great prices too!<//review>

No only that, but after buying a bundle of classes, and logging on to my computer with the correct username and password, I can no longer access my paid-for classes.

Tried different browsers, tablets, phones, Windows os, MacOS, but I cannot access MyCourses.

Same situation ongoing for weeks.

Should be a fairly simple fix if they had any competent programmers.

Yes, they continue to sign you up for classes, and collect your payment information, but once you enroll, you won’t be able to access the courses.

Forget about customer support.  Stackskills.com, Stackcommerce.com uses a third-party support service.  They cannot do anything to fix a broken website.

Someone hacked into my paypal account to make a purchase on your site for a product in the amount of $59.99.  I'm awaiting a response still from email support.

The culprit logged into a Safari OS from NY according to the alert from paypal at September 6, 2020 at 2:57:48 PM PDT
Transaction ID: 1HP68424E1395130J
Invoice ID 16407475

They mirrored and captured my password information prior to this event and I changed my password immediately upon finding out around 10pm EST.

First of all, at 5:57pm EST I was in Danbury, eating at Stew Leonard's Outdoor Cafe at the time this unauthorized purchase occurred- I didn't leave Stew Leonard's till around 620pm. (I have the receipts)

My phone was off and Connecticut residents right now are advised not to travel to NY due to covid or I wouldn't be able to go to my doctor appointments 2x every week.

There's no way this was me.

Please refund the amount soon. Discover card has helped with the portion that went in as a backup payment method and fraud protection has kicked in.

Paypal on the other hand has made this difficult although they were the one to notify me of unusual login to account exactly when the purchase occurred.

Thank you- E.S.< /Text>< Pics>

splendid courses on IT. Best offer you could ever get. I got tons of free 2019 courses on PMP, SCRUM, Security and certification review. And I bought another product called unlimited and lifetime access for just 59$.
I just wish that courses included on unlimited and lifetime access are recent and not outdated.</text>

I have ordered multiple times over the past 5 years and never had a problem downloading, installing, and registering my purchases until this latest purchase. This time there was no download link and no license code to be found anywhere. After exchanging several messages I finally connected with a live agent who was able to supply the download link and a license code and then things proceeded smoothly.< /Text>

I always chose lifetime facility in courses and the choice of such courses is extensive.  I see benefits in using these online courses.  I do not think it twice to express my joy and satisfaction I get from my courses and I highly recommend it. The level of the course contents is high.<//Text>

The level they teach at is perfect for me.  They switch from using PC and Mac and the steps are sometimes different.  My real issue is when you email for help they take their time getting back to you.<//text>

I signed up for the Excel class as I use Excel almost daily, but am at the most at the beginner level.   It has been nice to use the system on my own time and to learn little things about Excel that I am sure are the most basic, but to me they will help save so much time.   I like the layout of the training.   The speaker talks a bit fast for me, but it is nice to have two monitors as I have the training spreadsheet on one monitor and the class on the other.   I can stop the trainer at any time and reward or fast forward to ensure I am learning the specific point he is trying to teach!   Will look to take additional courses once I can finish this one (it is a very long course!!!)<//Text>

<Text>Used StackCommerce for a few years and never had a complaint about what I've bought which is nice.  I contacted customer service because I thought a purchase record was missing from my account and the customer service person was very patient and helpful and helped my find that I inadvertently had been buying things using two of my E-mail addresses which was clearly my fault.  Her patience was amazing and she helped me find the purchase I was looking for.  GREAT experience!</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2bab830f37f0d:0x35f5ef4d475c5ce5</Gmap_id><Response>None</Response>< Pics>

I am having a terrible time dealing with StackCommerce. They are handling a sale I made through the website Boingboing.net. It's been over a month and I haven't received the item. I've been bounced around by their Support "Heroes", who don't throughly read my emails, refuse to refund me, and keep telling me their working on it. I am beyond frustrated with them.< /review>

The website worked well. Easy to order. Easy to pay. Unfortunately my order was cancelled due to lack of product.  No offer to delay or be put on a wait list.   Not sure if I'll use the site again.<//Review>

If you order something from them, be aware they are just the middlemen.  They have no control, positive or negative, over your order or the shipment.  Do not buy gifts from them, do not buy something that you need to receive in a certain amount of time, do not count on their ETAs or other dates.  They work through low cost suppliers and shippers so the savings might be worth it to you, but just be aware of the consequences.<//Text>

<Review>I had four orders in the month of December 2019 totaling approximately $250.00.  I found the quality of the items I purchased to be satisfying.  I liked some items so much I ordered them again in a different color.  I gave only four stars because the orders I made in January 2020 have been disappointing, but StackCommerce is working diligently to correct the problems.   One dispute has already been settled in my favor.  I do appreciate that.  I am paying attention to the vendors that have better quality products.  I will order from them again.  Being under the 'umbrella' of StackCommerce is a benefit to these companies.  I am more willing to purchase from them because of this good business practice.  I will recommend my favorite items to my friends and family.  In fact, some received them as gifts.  Thank you, StackCommerce, for offering the many vendors and their products at such affordable prices.< /Review>< Rating>

Horrible.   Placed an order on 7/4/2020, and received an email that it shipped on 7/15/2020 with a tracking number, and an expected delivery date between 7/16 and 7/19/2020.   When checking the tracking number, no info was available.  I made an inquiry to StackCommerce on 7/22/2020, and received a response the next day with the tracking info indicating that my order was "handed over to the destination country by the airline on 7/18/2020.

As of 8/3/2020, I had not received my order, and there was still no updated tracking info; 16 days after the last shipping update.  On 8/1/2020, I wrote another email to StackCommerce asking for info on my order.  I received their canned response with apologies.  They indicated that they reached out to the vendor for an update and would get back to me shortly.  Well, it is now 8/4/2020, and there has been no response.

Should I not receive a satisfactory response, I will explore my options and take further action.  I should have paid attention to the other negative reviews.  I have learned my lesson.  Buyer beware.< /Review>

Purchased multiple courses and have had a positive experience with the content and format. Did have one course where no chapters or info was showing up so contacted customer support - was surprisingly easy to find the links.

The process was quick due to some drop down choices. I also included a screen shot so they could tell exactly which course I was having issues with. Heard back from them quickly with the solution. They even gave a couple of different links in case my browser had an issue. Super happy with how easy the process was and how helpful they were with the solution.</Text>

A quantity error was made at the point of shipment, resulting in a short shipment. We contacted the customer service, and while it took a few days for them to get back to us, once the communication was established a fix was quickly executed. The missing quantity was shipped out, and the customer service stayed on top of it to keep us informed. The initial error knocked off one star, but the rest kept four stars.<//text>

Got an design online course, so far so good and I'm still learning. UX on StackCommerce itself is generally good, except the receipt instruction can be confusing for new user like me. 1 purchase may involve in several communication emails, which resembles the sort of scams (with arranged emails to convince their victims) that plague the internet nowadays. It worried me at first, but this site is sure legit. Now, let me call out a name: Shaw Academy. They are offering some free courses through this site, please google this name before you make decision.<//review>

<review>A good place to get huge discounts on online training bundles. Quality of the courses varies, but generally useful. Navigation within a course is pretty good. Managing libraries of courses could use some work; it would be nice to have the option to put courses in folders, see completion and progress percentage from the library menu, etc. Customer support is responsive and helpful.< /review>< user_name>

Having purchased a lifetime license through StackCommerce for a software program, I had some trouble with the software developer honoring the purchase. StackCommerce validated my purchase, and made sure that I received the proper license. This type of service is rare these days. I HIGHLY recommend them.< /Text>

<review>The used iPad I purchased had a "Supervision Profile"  that can only be removed by the Third party that previously owned and remotely enforced supervision restrictions on the iPad usage. This could mean the iPad was acquired without the previous owner's permission.

This "supervision" is announced as soon as you turn on the device, but somehow their crack team of refurbishers missed that one.

Then it was many weeks of waiting and further delays until I received a refund through PayPal.

They are either sloppy and/or dishonest.< /review><UserId.>118419861485762222210</UserId.><user_name>Thomas Hibbard< /user_name>< Rating>

There was an initial mixup in the delivery of the purchased item.

But that was no problem for the company. In a few exchanged emails the situation was rectified immediately, far in excess of my anticipation.

I would highly recommend purchases from this company because you know that you’re on solid ground if you have any follow-up questions< /Review>

I purchased a cold brew coffee maker that did not work straight out of the box. Contacted them immediately and they offered to let me return it BUT I would lose HALF of my purchase amount  plus the original shipping cost to do so? If I chose to just exchange I would still have to pay shipping to receive a new one?  WTH people? Why is it ok to sell defective products and then expect the consumer to pay for your negligence? They will not comply with their own return policies without charging you for the return!</text>< Resp>

Extremely shady business practices. Worst I've ever encountered for an online seller. You'd be very well advised to avoid this company at all costs. Don't say you weren't warned.

UPDATE: I've added back one star since they finally refunded a recent purchase (that I had been requesting for weeks). I believe it only happened as a result of leaving this review... which isn't ideal, but sometimes you have to shout to be heard. With the refund, I also received an email from StackCommerce asking to discuss the issue. I emailed a reply right away. I never heard back. For what it's worth, the transaction I'm referring to here was only one of the multiple horrendous experiences I've had with this company.</Review>

<Review>StackSocial Support Heroes - an amazing support experience! I sent my friend a gift but he never received it, despite the USPS tracking stating the package had already been delivered. I submitted an inquiry to the Stack Social Support Heroes. I was really surprised by their response... In less than 24 hors, they had already shipped out a replacement, no argument, no extra paperwork, no hassle. The next day I found out that my friend's neighbor had put the package off to the side under the roof of the front porch because it was raining and my friend hadn't seen it. He rejected the extra package when it came, but we were totally impressed by the customer service. What a great experience and example! Imagine the world if all companies did business this way! Thank you!</Review>< pics>

The Stacksocial company, in my eyes, is amazing. I'm thoroughly awed by their level of professional, helpful support. They were the only ones providing a specific pair of earbuds I wanted, at a great price, arriving quickly. After communication with a tech helper about my item being defective, and when troubleshooting didn't work, they replaced my not working pair immediately and expediently. I cannot say enough nice things about them, they are simply great.<//review>

I purchased a Smart Watch Clone from an ad on idrop news from stack commerce several months ago. The first watch I received did not work properly, it was returned, another watch ( or even the original watch) was sent, it did not work properly either, it was returned, a third watch ( or the original watch ) was sent, it also did not work properly. Now they won’t honor the 1 year warranty unless I send them a $10 money order to cover shipping costs. This site is selling defective products with all sales final. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM EVER!!!!!<//text>

BEWARE..... READ FINE PRINT. NO OUT ONCE YOU'RE IN.  I paid $30 for a self-teach piano program. I admit I did not read the fine print. I did get the link to redeem and I downloaded 1 of about 30 PDFs. It ended up being too difficult for me to manage alone. Customer service won't refund, and I can't use this so-called "easiest" program. I was foolish for not knowing Stack is the  visible middle man  for tricksters to  hide behind.<//Text>

I ordered airtaps from stacksocial and unfortunately the product that arrived in the mail did not work. However, I reached out on the support tab on their site for help and they GAVE ME A FULL REFUND! I was given an option by their support representative (for a replacement/refund) I took the refund. They were VERY helpful and my problem was resolved in a matter of days. I look forward to doing business with them in the future. The prices on their site are unbeatable.

Thank you guys!!! You really outdid yourselves.

**I uploaded my evidence of a refund under "PHOTOS"**

UPDATE!!!! I got a package in the mail and they sent me a brand new pair of headphones after my REFUND! It came 2 weeks after my original review. Thank you soooo much!!! They work, too😍</Review>

They hit my charge card for $79.98.  Not sure how they got my number. I am only guessing but perhaps they have a program that runs numbers until one comes up as valid. Not sure if that is true but I know I know nothing about. They do not pick up the phones and they do not return phone calls.  Very suspicious. I am contacting the FBI today about them< /Review>

<Review>StackCommerce is an awesome online class store with really great classes like Excel Training, AutoCad Design, and 6 Sigma Classes with Certificates. I would highly encourage anyone who wants to further there training for there current jobs to move up the ladder or to start there own business.

Stay away from this company! I ordered something and the money came out of my bank account. No confirmation of my order. No phone number to call -only emails with useless assistance. As of now I haven’t received my order or gotten a refund. I will be taking further action to get my $100 back! Stay away they just take your money, read the other reviews!< /text>

I've bought several items from StackCommerce and have been happy for the most part. The last item I bought was exactly what I ordered and when I contacted support they immediately arranged to ship another one. What could be better than that!</Review>

Hi,

Your order is currently processing with the vendor. Rest assured that you'll receive tracking information as soon as it ships.

We're committed to transparency regarding our shipping times, thus you can view your expected delivery time-frame under 'Shipping' on the sale page for this item. You can also view this information in your account under the 'Purchases' tab.

If you have any further questions, I'm happy to help!
Your Support Hero,

I never could access the course that I ordered.  Since day one of the order, inquiries to the site just led me on a wild goose chase.  They make you sign up for accounts and surrender your data to Mashable, StackSkills, and other websites, and there is still no access to a course.  I am still inquiring about access or a refund, but I am not getting any help.  I will try a little longer before contacting a third party.<//review>

<GmapID>0x80c2bab830f37f0d:0x35f5ef4d475c5ce5<//GmapID><review>I ordered $100 of store credit from StackSocial for $80. Evidently, you cannot use a coupon if you're pay with store credit. Here's where the 1 star comes in. Nowhere on the checkout page did it say that purchases of credits could not be refunded, but I couldn't find a way to request one. I was planning to use these credits along with a coupon code, but the site didn't tell me this wasn't possible when I was buying the credits, it didn't tell me until I actually tried to use the credits with the code.

This seems kind of shady to me, especially considering they were offering 20% off credits at the same time as a 25% off coupon code, honestly almost seems like the site is trying to bait people into a worse discount.

Store credit, especially credit that is paid for with cash, should be treated like cash, not like arcade tickets. Coupons should work, but the problem I have is that this wasn't stated to me until I had made the purchase, and there's no automatic refund option for unredeemed credits. It's very sketchy and honestly makes me a little weary of StackSocial in general for any future purchases I may make.

I have also submitted the below message to PayPal:

StackCommerce,
I purchased $100 of store credit for $80 with the intention to use my credits along with a coupon code I had to get a good deal on a piece of software StackSocial was selling at the time. After I had purchased the credits and went to buy the software, the system informed me that I couldn't use the coupon code with credits, and the coupon code was a bigger discount, so I used that. Now I'm stuck with $100 in store credit that I have no intention to use and that they refuse to refund. The credits are unused and no third party vendor is involved, so a refund should be simple. Furthermore, I feel I was bait-and-switched by StackSocial into purchasing credits that are worse values than coupon codes and not allowing coupons to be used with credits and not making it abundantly clear when purchasing credits that this is the case. The only place you can see that coupons don't work when paying with credits, as far as support told me and as far as I can find, is the FAQ, and there is no reasonable expectation for a customer to go through every question on an FAQ before making a purchase.

I had to open a dispute with PayPal to get my refund, at which point my "hero" Daisy emailed me saying SHE provided the refund. I then got another email from StackSocial, asking if I'd like to update my negative feedback now that the issue was "resolved."

So here I am, updating my negative review, and leaving it negative. I wish I could be more critical than I already was. This will be the last time I shop at StackSocial.

I was only going to send this review to StackSocial's internal feedback, but then I got one more email from StackSocial.

They had thanked me for leaving a review that apparently implied I "had a great experience shopping with [them]!" At first I thought the language was off and they were thanking me for leaving a review in general, but then I went back to the link they sent me where I could update my review, and it had changed to positive. Everything I wrote was there, but the rating was now positive instead of negative.

I tested the link, and it seems StackSocial added a command to the end of the URL that defaults the page to pre-select "I'm Satisfied" when you go the site, so even if all you do is add text to your negative review and hit save, it will change it to a positive review based on the link they sent you.

I can't share the entire link because I don't want to leak any personal information, but the command "&intention=16" at the end of a StackSocial review URL is what pre-selects the positive rating, take it away and the review loads up with whatever it ACTUALLY is.

I honestly can't believe how shady StackSocial has been every step of the way, it's honestly worrisome I ever shared my credit card or paypal information with them.

1 Star, and I know it's a cliche, but I'd give 0 if I could.< /review><userid>109413715671841384481</userid>< Rate>

<Review>I purchased the GeoZilla product and was unable to get it to work.  My support requests fail to provide me with a solution even after sending seven screenshots.

When I start GeoZilla, it wants me to buy hardware.  I purchased a lifetime subscription and don't need to buy additional hardware.  Going forward takes me to more addition hardware advertisements. The last screen want me to buy a ONE year subscription for $59.99.  I own a LIFETIME subscription and don't need an one year subscription.

When using the back button, I find more advertisements and again the opportunity to buy an one year subscription even after buying a lifetime subscription.

The support reply says to look for a hamburger (three stripes), but it isn't anywhere to be found.  I sent screenshots of all the pages for the app asking for someone to point the hamburger out.  I have yet to hear back from them.

StackCommerce closed the support ticket.  I wrote a review about their failure to support me and how they won't provide a refund.  They sent me a request asking me to change the review to say how wonderful I found their support.

No wonder this company doesn't give refunds!  They'd be broke given my experience of selling a broken app they won't fix or support!

Stay clear of them and anything they're selling!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Scam store. They sell shill services that do not work, and deny a refund. When asked to legal information which they are obligated to show, they did not comply. I will chargeback them, report their account to their financial provider and take legal action against this trash company. Stay away.<//review>

This is the worst online company ever.  I would give them "zero" stars if possible.  They have no phone support and do not answer their emails.

Do not buy from this company.  They sell scams.  Here is my story:

1.	I purchased a Planagram Lifetime Membership on Big Think Shop in January
2.	After setting it up I posted one post to Instagram and it instantly worked.
3.	 Beginning February 7 I scheduled 10 more posts to instagram and all of them failed
4.	On February 7 I asked Planagram on their platform's dashboard messenger to post the scheduled posts to instagram
5.	Big Think Shop has literally no way of contacting support. None.  So, I contact Stackcommerce on February 12.  Stackcommerce runs the online stores for Big Think Shop, Mashable and more.
6.	On February 19 Planagram finally replied with "Instagram posts can be scheduled to facebook, but not directly through our service.  We recommend something like IFTTT.  "
7.	On February 20, Support for Stackcommerce told me that Planagram told them that they had emailed me. This was a lie.
8.	On February 28, Stackcommerce informed me that Planagram told them their service was for scheduling to Instagram not for facebook to which I replied that I was trying to schedule to Instagram and not facebook.
9.	On March 2, Planagram finally emailed me asking me to describe the issue I was having.
10.	On March 3, Stackcommerce forwarded me this from Planagram: "The error this user has received is usually because of a change to their account, such as a password change. We encourage the user to remove and re-add their account with updated credentials, this would be the best way to resolve this issue."
11.	I changed my password on February 25 because I feared retribution from Planagram for complaining and requesting a refund.  There were no changes to my account until this day.
12.	On March 6 I emailed this info to Stackcommerce and Planagram Support to clarify the issue and request a refund of $50.

I am a new father who was looking to save time and be more organized.  Stackcommerce is allowing Scam Artists to sell products online and as a result I have lost time and money that could have gone to my family.  I warned them that if I did not receive a refund by Wednesday March 11, 2020 that I would post this on every post, review site and social media feed I could find.  I am doing this in the hopes that no one else is scammed by these companies.</Review>

Somehow this company tried charging my debit card over $500, I never even heard about them, they made 8 attempts to use my card, 4 which failed, and 4 more which were authorized using my wifes card and even the 3 digit code on the back. I had to cancel the card and now I waiting and hoping that  money doesn't come  out because we never heard of or did business with this company. We have gone through so much stress over this, that's alot of money that would devastate our household. PLEASE BEWARE OF FRAUDULENT CHARGES, CHECK YOUR ACCOUNT OFTEN</review>

<time>1558860170788< /time><rate>1</rate><review>I started two courses and I was disappointed with the audio quality (for example in the background you can hear children playing and running). I just think this is not professional whatever the value is in the course. You just can not take it seriously and expect that it would be good for you if the person who created the course did not take it seriously. I know that if I was the one charging people for my course I would take it 100% serious because people would expect from me professionalism and to give them some value and knowledge.< /review>< Pics>

5 stars fully deserved. I order the goods, but did not received it within expected delivery date. Thus I wrote to customer support and got replied in several hours. After contacting the seller it turned out, that they had some error in the system and goods should not be available for order in my country. Thus I got full refund + $10 credit for next purchase.
But the story continues. Next day I received the goods after all! But the money were already refunded. I wrote them back, that by some coincidence my parcel arrived and that I am willing to pay for it, if they give me the payment details. Again immediate reply stating, that I can keep it and that the expense is on them, for all the struggle!! That is what I call "Customer satisfaction first"!! Thank you.<//text>

Took 1 month (no exaggeration) to deliver a $150 product.  Refuses refund. Said I should have read the “terms” which stated all sales final.  Sure you got me on the fine print. Bottom line is you don’t sell high end products online as final sale. And if that’s your sales tactic, state it more clearly, and find a new business model.< /review>

<Review>LIKE NEW purchase at NEW YORK POST STORE, was all scratched up POS. The screen is damaged too. Customer service was all the same boiler plate messages over and over again.

I sent the pictures to the credit card company, and disputed the charge, and they refunded my money after two months.< /Review>< date>

LIKE NEW purchase at NEW YORK POST STORE, was all scratched up POS. The screen is damaged too. Customer service was all the same boiler plate messages over and over again.

I sent the pictures to the credit card company, and disputed the charge, and they refunded my money after two months.< /text>

I've recently purchased a course and had an issue redeeming it. I received help from Desmond in support and was really pleased with his dedication to helping me with my issue, his response time was always under 10min. He was extremely helpful and patient. I truly appreciate the great customer service. Service like that is very rare these days.</Text>

I never saw the product I paid for.  The scam works like this:  you pay, and then you're directed to another page where you are instructed to "enter your code [and] redeem your coupon".  To redeem in this sense means you give up any refund before you ever see the product.  I never saw the product, I asked for a refund, I was denied.  My guess is this is likely how they make the largest share of their money.  If a company won't back what they're selling, it's a virtual guarantee the product isn't worth having.< /text>

<Text>Good luck buying anything from this company.  They will not give you a refund- stated 15 day return policy. I bought a product that wasn’t what I expected I wanted to return it to get a full refund on my credit card but they said the only thing they can do is to send me another one.  I’ve been purchasing products from this company for at least three years and I thought they were great until I had to return something.  Don’t do business with them<//Text><rating>1< /rating><user_name>Linda Mcentee<//user_name><Date>1523364239440</Date></record>

Item ordered was received fast but missing a small part.  Wrote to Customer Service and had a response within hours.  Even better, instead of simply sending me the missing part, they immediately shipped an entire, brand-new item!   Best customer service I've seen ... I'm a very happy customer and will definitely refer others.  Happy to shop with them again and again!</Review>

<review>I’ve been looking to buy this drone and it was always just a bit too expensive. One day my friend sent me a link to the drone I wanted on this stack site place and it was $100 below the regular price. I bought it immediately and got it within 4 days. Fast forward two months later and in one of their emails, I saw this electric bike that was $1200 OFF. I bought that and I have to say - it is AWESOME!!! I’ve probably recommended this site to ten of my friends and have now bought over 7 products from Stack.

I wish they had a mobile app, but whatevs. The emails are fun to go through and I’m just stoked on all the money I saved.

The pure cycle Volta bike is by far the best bike I’ve ever had. Thanks stack< /review></record>

I ordered the "build on" brick mug, which looked like a really cool gift for my college-age nephews. It's basically a very hard plastic (well built) mug with lego on the outside so you can "build" your own designs. I ordered 2 blue mugs & the cart had the price for them & I tried to use my coupon (couldn't figure out where). When I paid, my receipt said "thank you for 4 blue mugs." I called & asked to refund the extra amount for the 2 mugs I didn't want (or order) and to apply the coupon code I wasn't able to find in the check-out area. I was told that since the order was "in process" I couldn't be refunded OR use the coupon. When I received my mugs, I received 4 black mugs. I went back and forth with customer service for a few days & was given a postage-paid return. It took me about a week or 2 to get this in the mail, which brought us up to about early to mid-April. I needed to contact customer service again in early May since I had not yet received my refund. From that point until today was 11 days to receive the refund I was supposed to receive over a month ago. Good product, horrible follow-up. I haven't decided yet whether I will order from them again. I am guessing that it is an online "storefront" with many vendors... I hope others don't have the same experience.</Text>

I received only part of my order, from two vendors but a shared tracking number. One email to the support center solved it: I got a prompt response from Zach L saying my concern had been received, and within a couple of hours he had contacted the vendor, had the missing items shipped, and replied to me again with a new tracking #.  Everything arrived as scheduled after that. Thanks Zach!</review>

Worst service in terms of purchases. I bought a cloud storage coupon and figured the cloud storage company does not have any great features, I emailed Stack Commerce right away about me not being totally satisfied and requested a refund WITHIN 6 Hours of purchase. The company says its policy doesn’t do refunds when the coupon is claimed. The cloud storage is none of my use now.< /text>

Customer service was non-existent. You’re taking a huge risk doing business with these people - if you have an issue, you’re out of luck, they’ve already got your money. Avoid them at all costs.

To the rip-off merchants who conned me - do the right thing and exchange my product and I’ll alter my review.< /text><Time>1547712148079< /Time><GmapID>0x80c2bab830f37f0d:0x35f5ef4d475c5ce5<//GmapID>< Response>

<user>102823134926042130425<//user><review>I was looking to upgrade Moviesherlock on my computer, I went to the site and clicked to see the cost.  I later went back to the side and decided to purchase the upgrade, not seeing that the site/basket had remember my first looking into.  I by accident purchased 2 upgrades for one computer at home, Desmond was very helpful in changing the order and helping me correct my stupid mistake of not looking carefully at the amount of upgrades ordered.  Thank you Stackcommerce.  Excellent helpful service and fast downloads.</review></record>

Bought $102. Chromebook at the New York Post Store. The Chromebook is too old for updates from Google-Chrome, so it is basically useless. No refunds, no returns. These folks are committing fraud on the public.< /text>

<review>They made bogus charges on my credit card for $1 and $00.00.  Then they sent through my order Charge.  Because they made bogus charges my credit card company threw my card into FRAUD alert and block all my Credit card shopping on Black Friday not to be confused with Cyber Monday.  I now am in a long fight to ReShop all over again.  This is hours and hours of shopping.  The carts were emptied when I hit check out.  now some sites are not honoring the Black Friday Deals because they are over and their system was setting up for Cyber Monday.

{'time': 1512159554696, 'text': 'Hello Beth,\n\nWe have sent you a message to resolve the issue. To clarify, the $1 charge is actually a temporary preauthorization from your credit card company, basically giving the merchant the green light to charge your card for the full amount when your final purchase is made. By preauthorizing your card $1, they don’t have to place a larger hold against your account.\n\nWe also do not have control over other websites and their check out process. We apologize for the inconvenience you went through but we cannot change that automation for the process of the payment processor or your card service.'}< /resp>

DO NOT SHOP HERE!

I wish I had read the reviews before making a purchase!

It seems ridiculous that you should need a computer for a mobile app. It’s even worse that something I can’t use has also been marked “claimed” when I can’t use it, so I can’t even get a useless store credit.

Very disappointed that facebook would accept ads from this company.</Text>

No stars. but they made me choose one before I could post. They took my money and never sent the items and offer only excuses.
UPDATE -- The items finally arrived more than a month after they said they were bring shipped. They talked about "fulfillment issues" which I guess means they sold things they did not have.< /text>

Spectacular Customer Service! I had a product was delivered by another vendor but sold by them. It was defective but sold as "all sales are final." I assumed my money was lost when they said, "We'll contact the vendor." But, I got a note from them a few days later saying the vendor was unresponsive and rather than waiting for them to make it right, they just refunded my money. More than I expected from them. Very pleased.<//Review>

The only reason that I gave this worthless company even one star is just so it would allow me to post. The company is trash. I basically bought a discount voucher for the product instead of the actual product I was led to believe I bought. Do not waste your time or your money on this garbage company.<//Review>

Only after you purchase the software. Also I needed a VAT invoice for this purchase and there was no option to enter a VAT during my order. When I requested a VAT invoice after my purchase they said they are unable to provide me with one and I should create one myself using a sample template they sent me and the available details I had. That was the worst experience I ever had purchasing a software online. Be extra careful when purchasing from them.<//text><user>103845702429146925720<//user><Response>None<//Response></record>

AND they don't work independently (i.e., charge one while using the other)   These things are basically garbage.  My blue tooth that I have used for years holds a charge much longer and is more dependable than these !!<//Review>< user_id>

DO NOT waste your money and time , very very bad customer service, I’ve waited for over a month to get my order and still not getting yet , the expected delivery time was 12/7-12-7 but not getting anything yet , I emailed customer service but no response, this place is scam , do not waste your money , this is a big lesson for me to read a review about any company before I place my order . I wish there is zero star to rate those scammers .< /Review>

I purchased a coupon, but Stackcommerce gave me a faulty coupon code (didn't work on the website). I sent a ticket, and received a (very slow) response with a new code. However, when I went to the website to redeem, there was no place to input the code, so I was charged for the full price of the product AND charged for the coupon. I have been trying to contact Stackcommerce for the past MONTH and have thus far only received two (very unhelpful) responses. I highly do not recommend this site to anyone. The customer service is extremely disappointing.</Review>

<Review>2-in-1 Lightning to Headphone Jack Charging Cable: 3-Pack for my iPhone 7.   They don’t work. I receive an error message *This accessory is not supported by this iPhone* on my phone each and every time I have attempted to use any of them. Why? If they are not supported by Apple iPhone 7, which iPhone does support them? If they are not supported by any iPhone, why are you selling them?   Refund me now.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>I got air bud wireless earbuds and they don't even take a charge. I have emailed them several times with no response. The earbuds were over $25 shipped and shouldn't be total junk.  I am resorting to refusing the charges since their customer service is non existent.

Company delivered a fake non working product, not as advertised. Filing complaints with FTC, bbb and the attorney general due to the fact that they refuse to give me a refund. They are currently trying to force me into accepting a replacement to which I’ve clearly indicated that I have no interest in. Consumers have the right to refuse a buyer sales agreement once the seller has introduced deceptive trade practices. In my case, they advertised one thing to me which I was willing to pay for but sent me a completely illegitimate item which was not as advertised. I have the right to refuse any business relationship with this company as it has violated my rights as a consumer. I have the right to a full refund due to the fact that this company has advertised goods with the intent not to sell them as advertised. Also, this company has made false and misleading comments to me as I was trying to remedy the situation by misrepresenting to me that I was obligated to accept only a replacement and not a refund as I had somehow unknowingly entered into some sort of agreement upon placing my order without signing any contractual agreement. I am making this review solely on my experience with stack commerce and not making suggestions to any other consumer going forward.</Review>

Bought some products from they, skipped half the products on delivery and getting customer service is almost non-existent. Would not recommend this company. Now their product is faulty but their customer service team won't answer the support queries! Bad company.</Text>

Bought a low quality course from pastebin's website. Asked a refund on the same day. Got a refund on the same day.
This is not as bad as I expected. They did their job as a middleman. However, I highly suggest avoiding CyberTraining365.<//text>

< Review>
I bought a Grammarly 1 year premium voucher from StackSocial(A StackCommerce spawn). Apparently you can't use the voucher if you're already a user with a Grammarly premium account. This isn't mentioned anywhere on the product listing(See Attached). I've spoken to 3 different customer support representatives and they either respond(while also closing the ticket) with irreverent well-wishing-nonsense telling me that what I bought is incompatible with my current Grammarly user status(which I already know since that's why I'm creating the ticket) or they talk about how since StackSocial is too focused on giving me a great deal they have to sacrifice providing reasonable customer service because they are too incompetent to tell whether or not a voucher has been redeemed.

Update:
After speaking with a fourth representative, I was able to pick up on a loophole in their spiel. If I received approval from Grammarly, they would issue the refund. I had already chatted with Grammarly before this and they were the ones who suggested I speak with StackSocial. I sent a screenshot of that conversation and a refund was issued somewhat promptly. This company's customer service was still garbarge.< /Review>

Last movement was "En route to DHL ecommerce dist ctr" on Nov 30, 2017.
Contacted the iDrop News Store on Dec 9 2017 and got a return email from "Diana Prince" (cute..but not helpful) saying they would look into it.
Contacted again on Dec 18 2017 after hearing nothing from them.
Still awaiting a response. But after this experience I will never consider another purchase from them.</Text>< Pics>

Sent wrong item. Never responded or attempted to correct the problem. This was through the BGR store. Stay away. Take this back. They just credited me back a full refund. They are just a large volume seller and you have to be patient. It takes time, but they do right.</review>

I bought a VPN app through Neowin, a Stack Commerce company, and it absolutely does not work for me.  The particular VPN comes with a 7 day money back guarantee, and no where on the Neowin site does it state that all sales are final, nor does my invoice state that all sales are final, yet when I contacted Stack Commerce after 3 days of trying to get my app working (with assistance from the VPN provider) Stack Commerce told me that all sales are final.   This is not a trustworthy company.

I will update this review if I get my refund.

Update: Neowin/Stack Commerce has finally offered me a refund because I was within their 15 day refund policy, BUT they will only give me a store credit.  Why would I want to shop with a merchant that I don't believe is trustworthy.< /Text>

<date>1497713740751<//date><review>You should be careful when purchasing a VPN service. I have noticed there is no return for VPN services after I had purchased. They don't show any no-return policy while you are paying. Once you have paid, then you will see a hidden word, FINAL SALE. The original VPN service provider has a 15 days return policy, which means a return is technically possible. However, StackCommerce superhero (customer service) told me that it is impossible due to technical issue. Her excuse was more ridiculous.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><name>Sean Kim</name><GmapID>0x80c2bab830f37f0d:0x35f5ef4d475c5ce5< /GmapID>< Rating>

My attempt to purchase and download the Mac maintenance and anti-malware program, "Drive Genius" had failed on the MacWorld Shop. StackCommerce was the given support for any problems. There was no phone # or live chat available, but only an email back-and-forth… which I found odd, but StackCommerce was very responsive, almost as fast as a live chat, and my problem was fixed, when I was given a direct link to download the program. Installation and initialization was a success. Thanks!< /text>

Should have read the reviews before buying. Bought 3 of same items, never received a receipt or email confirmation. Emailed them 3 weeks after the purchase wondering where my items were and they couldn't find the order. But magically when I said I'd dispute it with my cc they found my order! Another week goes by and I asked for a refund and they reply 2 days later and say it's been shipped. Took 2 weeks to ship halfway across the country! Received the items but not how described. Total scam, opened a dispute with my credit card company after refusing a refund.< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Terrible so far. Charged immediately for 'free course' Offered five 1hr 'free' online courses - entered payment info and redemption code - immediately charged - sent email five times in last two days asking for credit and response - no option for immediate response -just an autogenerated email thanking me and saying someone would contact me in '2 business days.. 1 hr course was okay but many references to jsbin website were outdated and didn't match my screen even though I used all the recommendations - chrome, etc. Onlilne form is only method I can find to contact them; searched google, they use so many different names, some requiring separate id's and passwords. very strange. Names Stackcommerce, GDGT,  etc. Funny how the charge was done immediately even though I entered a free redemption code, BUT I have to wait two business days. ie. THURS  FRI  sat sun MON. It's Saturday now so I hope I hear something by Monday.<//Review>< pics>

I pretty much also get a blended toffee coffee with swirls and whip. It is delicious, sweet and hits the spot if I want a sweet coffee treat in the afternoon.
I've also gotten hot chocolate from here and it is also delicious! Perfect for overcast, chilly days!</text>

I came through with my kids and was very close to just leaving because of the recent conversations and outfits I’ve been hearing and seeing. Bring the old girls back at least they cared and talked to us. Especially the girl that used to be in the mornings. It isn’t the same without them and I know I’m not the only one that will not be coming back here.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<text>Used to love this place. Lindsey was lit the best. Then girl named Marissa started working here and she for one never gets the order correct.

But then this happened... . I was there with my husband... Marissa was wearing a pair of the shortest shorts that literally showed half her a** cheeks. While she was making our coffee she bent over in front of the window and just stood there provocatively and even kept adjusting her clothes and squirming around..... I couldn't believe it.  My husband even commented, "what was up with her"....
Someone needs to address that girl and tell her to dress appropriately for work.
The young man before us was at the window for 15 minutes while she flirted with him.

We don't need high school mentality for our once fav coffee shop. Someone please tell that girl to grow up and to dress/work with some poise and sophistication.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1540671988994, 'text': 'I apologize that this happened-I do have a dress code and I will make sure that everyone is clear on it- thank you for bringing this to my attention-'}</resp><gmap_id>0x809a59e6895ef6a9:0x4a837969e905a449< /gmap_id></record>

< Review>
I never leave negative reviews but I was also shocked like the woman below about the new prices.
I could go to Totem coffee on main street and get a delicious small mocha for literally two to three dollars less than Bean Barn.
The girls working at Bean Barn mentioned that the owner has increased all of the prices (again) on all of their drinks.
Ive always loved Bean Barn and it always seemed like a lovely local customer friendly atmosphere with really good prices BUT unfortunately this is no longer the case.

I really do hope that the owner sees some of these reviews and re-thinks her pricing to match both demographic and location. We are not in the Bay Area and we are very limited in where we can get good coffee. As a small town... We should not be taken advantage of in that way 😔

For now.... I will be at Totem 🗿 ☕< /Review>

The food is absolutely solid! 👌 Don't be fooled by the old decor. The service is typical Cantonese style.< /Text>

A true hidden gem! What delicious food for an incredibly low bargain! I had 3 lunch specials for me, myself, and I. I paid under $30! The dishes were delicious! The lobster was fresh. The noodles were perfectly seasoned. The oysters were my favorite! I chose to have them with garlic, and they were excellent! Spinach with garlic sauce was also excellent. I have been coming here for over 20 years, and I cannot thank this place enough for still being around! 20 more years please...<//review>

My family is in the food serving business and we always prefer this place over many others.

The cornish game hen is a great appetizer. Drizzle some lime and a little bam of the salt to bring this bird to life!

The whole menu is pretty solid. One of the family favorites is the whole yellow chicken. They always manage to make it tender and succulent time after time. I'm usually jaded with restaurant whole chicken but this place is the exception.<//Text>

A good place to try different lunch special. Black Cod with black bean sauce was amazing, jellyfish head dish is also great. Their service is not that great but you get good price on lunch specials. Good for family lunch.< /Review>

Good quality lunch special options for the entire family.  Been to this place for the last 20 years and hopefully for more. There might be a new restaurant around the block but you can't beat the price. No frills</Text>

I don't believe the place will last, we ordered 3 dishes. 2 of the orders were different even I pointed to the exact dishes from the menu with pictures. The 3 order never show up until we cancelled the order.
They never cancel the 3rd order on the bill until we protested. Didn't even talk about the freshness of food.<//Text>

<Text>Decor was rather beaten down and unspectacular, but the seafood was really fresh. We had, among other things, a plate of spotted prawn and a red grouper (I think?) fish that tasted great. I definitely recommend that fish.<//Text>< GmapID>

<review>This place used to be good. Now it is a far cry from what it once was. The new owner and the new staff are slow, rude, and downright lazy. They prioritized every table except ours. The only difference was we weren't Chinese. I have eaten here many times over the years, but the quality of service has never been this bad until now. I will NEVER return here again.<//review><resp>None< /resp>< time>

<Text>Got ripped off. Friend recommended this place for lunch because I was looking for fresh seafood. Ordered a geoduck which the manager told me was 19 per lb. We ordered 5 other dishes which was about 10 each as per the lunch special menu. The bill ended up to be over 200. Never coming back to NYC again.< /Text>< pictures>

Good old, dirty Canto spot. Authentic and open late enough that working class people can get their meal in before retiring for the night. The staff is responsive without seeming like they do it only for a tip. When you see the same guys working at a place for 25 years...you know it's good.< /Review>

Very good place to eat Hong Kong style Chinese food in Monterey Park, not expensive at all and good food.  And their lunch special prices goes until 5pm so that’s awesome.</Text>

The food is very delicious!  You don't really wait a lot and the food is hot and fresh.  our family favorite is the fresh Lobster or crab🍲   So, if you get a chance drop by and taste for yourself.  Buen appetite!< /review>

We went here for live shrimp & crab. Food & service were ok while dinning.
But one tall man ruined our dinner. I accidentally paid with a BofA debit card instead BofA credit card. So, I asked the tall man at cashier's desk to void the charge, but he said that ther's no way to void it once charged. Then, our server, Ki, came and he asked the tall man to void it. But he just charged the new card & refused to give us the void receipt. Again, he said no way to print it! So, I asked him to write down his name on the original receipt in case of double charge, but he raised his voice again. Ki ran back to us and he gave us his own name instead.
I left too much tip (15%) for them. :(
I wish I can give them - star!< /review>

(Translated by Google) This is a Cantonese restaurant. Special lunches include porridge, flour, noodles, and rice. The price is economical. A dish with rice and soup. I am going to eat alone. Called a fire tofu. The meat is slightly harder. Tofu tastes good. The soup is the Bawang flower ribs soup. Not bad! The weight of the dish is also large. I am full and half pack home. The $6.99 lunch tax and tipping do not cost ten dollars.

(Original)
這是一家粵菜飯館。特價午餐有粥、粉、麵、飯。價錢經濟實惠。一份菜配白飯和例湯。我一個人去吃。叫了個火腩豆腐。燒肉稍硬些。豆腐味道很好。例湯是霸王花排骨湯。不錯！菜的分量也大。我吃飽了還剩一半打包回家。$6.99的午餐打稅加小費還不用十塊錢。<//Review>

(Translated by Google) There are two single rooms that can accommodate 10 people for dinner. The seafood meal is affordable. There are few places to eat in Los Angeles. The waiters are male and handsome.

<review>My car recently broke down outside of Truckee.  I originally went to NAPA for help and part replacement.  The staff I encountered were rude, condescending and of little help. I then left NAPA and walked to O'Reilly's Auto parts where I found great customer service, the right parts and friendly helping people.  I returned to my vehicle to realized I needed 1 extra part. When walking back into town I didn't even bother stopping at NAPA. Instead I chose to walk the extra +1 mile round trip past NAPA to O'Reilly's Auto parts. Do yourself a favor and avoid this business if you can. There are much friendlier shops that want your business and have a better selection of parts.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Good store with helpfull staff. They ALLWAYS WILL HAVE CHAINS. Allways. If chain controls are on by northstar, come here and they will take care of you. There is also often someone out front to help put them on if you don't want to break a nail or something.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I am obviously biased as my Dad is the Manager, but this store is great. They have almost anything you need and if they do not have it they can often find it next day by 2pm! Amazon might beat the price occasionally, but the help and service is well worth it. Se hable Espanol.</review>

Stopped in the Trukee NAPA to grab snow chains as my wife was getting ski boots adjusted across the street at Start Haus. The weather was fine and they were not busy so I figured it would be a good opportunity to make a purchase and ask some questions. Unfortunately the guy working the desk was impatient and treated me like an idiot, even though I had done plenty of research before coming to the store. After showing him a picture of my tire specs and confirming that he had the right size, the chains he sold me are way too big. Thankfully a NAPA store in Sacramento said they would exchange these for the right size.<//Text>

My first priority with any business or product I support is value, and Napa in Truckee brings it. I've been shopping all over, online, from dealerships, etc and when I hear Napa's price, I'm consistently shocked. They beat the Ford dealer by half or better, most all the time, and others by more. They're even cheaper than most of the best available internet prices on Amazon, ebay, etc. I'm consistently surprised and very pleased these guys are in Truckee. Their service is great, they have a diagnostic scan tool free for their customers to use, will test batteries for free, and are just overall happy and helpful. Thanks guys!</Text>

I live in Truckee,  I have gone to Napa Auto Parts a couple of times.  Same result everytime.  Rude and overpriced.  Now I go down the hill to Reno.  I refuse to spend my money in a place where they overcharge you and are rude.  They act like they are doing you a favor.  I am suprised they are still in business.  Go down the block to N/C auto next to the DMV</review>

The hike to the top is honestly one of the steepest trails I've ever hiked. Be ready for the burn if you do decide to venture up. Once at the top you've got a great view though that mostly makes it worth it. It's and fun and free thing to do along the 1.<//Review>

Normally, I consider this trail a solid 3-stars, mostly for the views from the top. However, the recent fires that hit this mountain, followed by abundant rainfall has created an explosion of color!

The trail is moderately easy for most of the length, with a few fairly steep sections. Suitable for any age group other than young children.  The initial climb is steep and leads to a “T”. Go right for the longer gentler ascent or go left for the steep and shorter climb (you can also just do a loop, in which case I recommend climbing the steep ascent and walking down the gentler slope).

The gentler ascent actually has notably better views. Ocean views, the naval air field, and one of the most scenic stretches of the PCH in California await.  If adventurous, take the 6-mile loop trail around the summit before ascending.

Gorgeous flowers (after a spring rain), mountain vistas, and various wildlife (including rattlesnakes) await.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80e8476542b300a7:0xd354956b4395d9dc</gmap_id></record>

<review>Gorgeous views -- see the pictures.
Some trails in the area are closed and Google maps does NOT know about these closures. Be sure to read the (water-damaged) notices at the start of the Chumash trail.<//review><user_id>108857574966014843240<//user_id>< Resp>

<review>lots of good products, but on the expensive side and the two times i've been there recently one of the staff was not wearing a mask and did not looked like they cared. Won't be back. SHAME!< /review>< pics>

Multiple supplies for a wide variety of animals. All the way from Horses to Guinea pigs. It's an old school feed store and its a refreshing place to go for a look. Its definitely not a Petco, which is what makes the Feed Barn such a unique and fun place to shop. Plus their prices are more then fair, some items are cheaper then Amazon.<//text>

<Response>None</Response><Text>Love this feed store. It is not just livestock material, but food for all sorts of animals, too. They have food for everything from dogs and cats to birds and rabbits.

I just bought sunflower seeds, in shell peanuts and mixed nuts to make my own squirrel food. I like that they have both pre-made bags and self-serve, which made it very easy for me. And the price is very reasonable.

They are also friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. I highly recommend them.< /Text><user_name>Robert Hankin<//user_name><Pics>None<//Pics>< Time>

This stuff is only the best thing created by nature to completely remove all odors caused by pets from your carpet! Gets rid of mold and mildew odors, too! It's a powerhouse all-in-one.....Antibacterial, Antimicrobial, Antiviral and Antifungal. It's a great body cleanse, drink to detoxify your entire body.</Review><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcf1a7936d48f3:0x4da6e2c3216372e6< /Gmap_id><rating>5<//rating>< Time>

Amber is a delightful, informative and good at what she does. Not only do they supply pretty much everything you should need, they have a 14 lb giant rabbit who hop's around freely a beautiful girl cat who is the best buddy of the rabbit. They have a variety of chickens. We've enjoyed every visit and have all our needs met.< /review>

<Time>1539803742951</Time><Text>Went there to get flea medicine for dogs. There's a PetSmart across the street but I prefer to support local business even if it's sometimes a little more expensive than chain stores. I asked to use the bathroom and some scruffy guy that works there said "it's not for customers." I turned right around went back to my car and took my business to PetSmart, because they have a bathroom for "customers," and their price is more competitive. So whatever. Good luck to you guys.<//Text></record>

This place is awesome and they have really good customer service. I went in there to buy a Mother’s Day Gift and the girls really helped me out. Karina and Danielle are really nice and they knows their products. They helped me save some $$$ by telling me to get the app for rewards. I only come to this store for birthdays and holidays so it helps saving some cash. Also, at the register Sofia was really cool and she gave me candle boxes so that I can wrap them up and make them look nice for the gifts I’m giving away. I really felt welcomed here and I don’t mind spending extra if they really going to help me out since I hardly come into this store. Definetly coming back soon.</text>

So helpful! Everywhere we went there was an employee standing by to answer our questions. The $35 tote bag was a great bonus to our trip here today. We'll be back!!!</Text>

I like shopping at this particular store because the staff is so nice one person in particular his name is Angel I’ve gone in a few times when he is working he came up to me one time and I asked him if he would help me find some items for my husband and sons and he suggested quite a few things so we made some sets for them and they really liked what I had bought them only if they knew that I got help from Angel keep up the good work and continue helping customers like me.<//text>

The staff is always happy and ready to help.  I always come here. Been coming here for along time since I used to work In the mall.  Always has great deals and what I need.  The only problem is their lines...  It gets out of hand and people who are up are a little slow but hey nobody is perfect as long as the service is great:)< /Review>

Have their semi-annual sale, very crowded, decent priced. My only complaint, not enough coupons, they don't accept retailmenot coupons anymore.

The young lady said, register your email & you will get them, let me say, have done that numerous times, still no coupons.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Very good products, there is always variety for everyone. It is recommended to wait for the coupons by mail to take advantage of the offers. You can try most of the products there, they have a sink. It is almost always clean and tidy. Good service even when there are many people.

(Original)
Muy buenos productos, siempre hay variedad para todos. Se recomienda esperar los cupones por correo para aprovechar más las ofertas. Se pueden probar la mayoría de los productos ahí, tienen un lavabo. Casi siempre está limpia y ordenada. Buen servicio hasta cuando hay mucha gente.</review>

Visit was okay. Nothing bad, but nothing great either. Clerk was friendly but over multi-tasking - answering multiple phones while taking our order, not completely understanding what we were trying to order because she was rushing. Breadsticks arrived almost immediately, tasted great. Pizza arrived quick, tasted great too. Soda fountain was out of all but three choices. Ordered a separate pizza to-go (right after ordering first pizza for dine-in) and was never told it was ready. I had to wait in line and ask for it.  It had sat on top of oven for 30+ minutes while we ate and edges were way over heated. Overall, this was only an "okay" experience.< /text>

Pizza was burned. When it's so expensive it should be perfectly cooked. Either learn too cook or sell your pizzas for half as much 🤷... Shoot me a email I will make you a pizza twice as delicious for half the price and I will STILL MAKE PROFIT! it's ridiculous the price is so inflated I think I should make a home pizza delivery service and undercut these profit oriented companies 🤣< /review>

Really like Mountain Mike's pizza but last 3 times we've been in here the "full bar" has been a wreck. Last time we ordered a pizza and had a beer while waiting. 2 sips into our beer a couple patrons start telling everyone the bars closed!! It's 4pm and I guess the bartenders shift was over? Managers don't  speak english and obviously didn't care and did nothing about it. Have seen that on several occasions. Called last week to see if there was a bartender there and the person answering the phone said "I don't know"! Asked her to ask the manager and could hear him say something like "not sure when".. So sad but typical of businesses growing too fast they forget about customer service and checking on the integrity of their employees.< /review>

My favorite is the cheese pizza with white sauce-- I'm allergic to tomatoes so I love that MM has that option. They put on just the right amount of toppings on my pizza - not too much or too little.
The service here though is phenomenal. The cashier was so polite to me and actually knew that they served a pizza with white sauce. The atmosphere was great, perfect for a pizza place. Casual but not so much it gets uncomfortable.

This is by far my favorite place to get pizza!< /review>

I LOVE Mountain Mike's! A place that kids can go to without fussing is a rare find, and this is the place. We always order from MM and have amazing service every time. I don't get stiffed on the toppings like other pizza places, and the staff is very knowledgeable of what they offer and how they cook their pizza.
Five Stars!< /Review>

I have had nothing but great service and food the past several times I have been here. There is plenty of room if you are planning on having a bigger event. The pizza is delicious, although I have eat cheese, my friends have made it pretty clear their combos are above par.
I use to go to Round Table, but now that I have been introduced to Mountain Mikes my friends and I usually go here, just a much more relaxed atmosphere and the food is much better and even better priced!< /Review>

A friend and I were out for the day. We had been running and decided to stop for a quick bite. We came across Mountain Mike's Pizza. I rarely stray from my usual pizza places because I know what I like and only a handful can do it the way I want. My friend was adamant about having pizza. So I said okay.

I am so glad I gave up the fight because this was one of the best pizzas I have ever had. It was amazing. The staff was courtesy and polite. I love the atmosphere inside the restaurant. I will certainly be returning.

Highly Recommended!!!< /text>

<name>Gabi Grande<//name><Pics>None<//Pics><text>University square MM is the worst. Employees are rude and totally incompetent. Every time I go there something is wrong with my order. The employees and manager seem completely put out by fixing THEIR mistakes. Don't bother using a coupon its always haasle to get them to honor it. For me, the charged my card for the original price and gave me the difference back in change. I'm not sure what is so hard about just applying the coupon to the order like any other restaurant. Side items are obviously store bought and disgusting. Pizza is decent but it's hard to want to go there with such a terrible staff.< /text><userid>115193884908889188200<//userid></record>

<Review>I love this place and their pizza but I miss Kev. Besides that though they have great pizza, perfect for baseball teams with coaches who have after season pizza parties to hand out trophies/medals, just order 3 mountain pizzas (2 cheese and 1 pepperoni) and you'll be good to go!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><user>103343625420107436744< /user><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
All the reviews are fake and written by the restaurant. You can tell by reading them, so, so lame. I'm giving it one star to balance out all the fake 5 star ratings. And the mananagers/staff must be retarded to think anybody would believe their obvious dishonesty. It's an F you to all the customers. Grow a brain......</Review>

Rented a house from these folks - we had a wonderful experience.  Issues were few and far between, but when problems did arise, they always had a maintenance company at our house within three hours to solve the problem.  We enjoyed working with the whole staff, but Larry McCroskey went above and beyond to make our year great.  We hope to come back some day!<//Text>

<review>I've been using Mission Property Management for approximately 4 years.
They manage my income property. I am very pleased with the work they do.
My tax person is thrilled with the through
Report they prepare. He says the best he's ever seen.
Thank you Mission Property Management.

Carl recently helped me purchasing a house in Pleasanton.  We are moving back from overseas, with the older kids waiting to be registered and an infant waiting to be settled, we were under great time pressure.  Carl is very patient, responsive, knowledgeable and thorough in explaining everything.  We got the whole moving in thing done in four weeks, very happy with the house.  Great job, Carl!< /Text>

<Review>Renters - please check your Mission Property lease with a lawyer or the Fremont tenant office . The lease we were presented didn't comply with CA rental laws. Carl Fox harassed us as tenants - and we saw many instances where he exposed the owner to additional financial and legal liability.<//Review><date>1551638471032<//date><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< user>

MIssion Property Management has managed our townhouse rental since June 2010.  They rented the property out for us because we moved to Pennsylvania at that time.  They have kept the same renter in the entire time.  They let us know about all events with the townhouse and handle all maintenance and repair issues.  They check the property for us and renew all leases.  We are very happy with Mission Property Managment!< /Text>

<text>Very busy when I walked in, I get it. My job is busy too. No greeting or acknowledgement as I stood at the counter alone for several minutes as they made drinks for their waiting customers. A young worker named Brian had to be told to come take my order eventually and he just walked up to the register and glanced at me then stared at the register. He could have said "hi", but I didnt hear anything, didnt see his mouth move. No blenders were going, he could have just been timid and spoke very low. After an awkward moment, I just stated my order, paid, then stood by and waited. A phone in order walked in and they greeted her and immediately made her drink before mine and she was out the door. Brian eventually made mine and it was watery, blander than any other location I'd order the same drink at. The young lady there, who seemed more experienced, put my drink in the cup and just blurted my name, no "thank you" or anything at all to me like she'd said to the other customers she gave drinks to or who entered the door. Maybe I don't look friendly?</text>< time>

I opted for Yogurtland went in made my Sunday went up to pay for my Sunday was informed they don't take cash. I'm 72 years old I have never had a credit card and I have no intentions of ever having a credit card . So I left my Sunday walked out ended up at Jamba Juice .

Kris and his coworker in the back were the best. Kris knew exactly what was on my mind. And his recommendation of the Sweet Belgium Waffle was satisfying and outstanding. The best experience I’ve ever had at a Jamba Juice!!!< /Text>

Just went into this Jamba juice & person in the back (who never acknowledged my presence) was wearing a mask below her chin. What's the point if its not even covering your mouth. Totally grossed out & left.<//Text>

Pretty good. Your average Jamba Juice, with the same menu. I do think this place could use some seating, as it barely has any, but there are places to sit at other businesses outside. This place is a bit cleaner and newer as it was recently made, and a plus is that this one has a bathroom. Also, I do prefer this one over the others as it is usually not busy and the line is short, which is a plus of coming to the one in Village Del Amo!<//text>

A< /user_name><time>1560979240209</time><rating>1<//rating><text>I normally have a great experience when I come here but this last time was just awful, for a number of reasons ... I would hate for someone else to experience what I did. I'm only giving one star for the nice barista who made my order and the bowl itself was still tasty

**While the cashier was taking my order another employee Was being super loud announcing to everyone she was going to lunch and then INTERRUPTED us and asked him details about what kind of lunch he wanted WHILE HE WAS IN MIDDLE OF TAKING MY ORDER

**I ordered one of the bowls, and asked for no goji berries, and extra almond butter. The cashier did NOT tell the barista and when I saw her about to add the berries I had to yell over the counter not to add them. Later after I had left to go eat there was no extra almond butter, AND I PAID THE EXTRA FOR THAT

**The cashier told the Barista that the other employee was too lazy to clean the bathroom so she put the "out of order sign" over the door - THIS IS SO DISGUSTING and I actually had to use the bathroom but I obviously didnt... and he also said he doesn't get paid enough to clean the bathrooms. This was sloppy and unprofessional, not just him gossiping but the employee being "too lazy" to clean the bathroom is also just gross.< /text>< pics>

I don't know. I hear such great things about this Jamba Juice. After getting my order, I realized I could go get a Naked or Bolthouse juice from the grocery store for almost half the price!! It was okay. But not worth the almost $6 I paid.</Review>

Be aware! Went there twice, both time missing items in my order. First time bought through drive thru they only gave me half of the order when I told them items were missing, guy in black shirt I supposed manager gave me the rest of the order and said “happy birthday” no apology, no nothing. The second time they forgot to give me 2 burgers. This time wasn’t so lucky because I didn’t check.</review>

The wait is still a bit long at times. The atmosphere is really nice and they do have a great wait staff! I had their nachos. They are really good! They do them with a salsa verde and chicken. They reminded me of authentic chicken enchiladas, but crunchy. I will be.< /Text>

Im from Redwood City and no longer reside there. It has been over 3 years but thid McDonalds is the best one out there. I have had McDonalds in Sunnyvale, East Palo Alto, San Carlos and a few other place yet this is the best one.

Why? They make their food fresh and on top of that, the employees provide good customer service. They always have a smile, they are nice and they get the job done. I ALWAYS receive my food hot snd freshly made.<//text>

<text>Fresh food. Quick service, and not just the drive through. They are open for food to be ordered inside as well. And online of course, curbside pickup. You just can't eat it there. But you can buy it there, and from there you can take your food wherever YOUR "there" is!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Long wait. They were having a Christmas party or something. I saw a lot of people inside. Could hear them laughing and partying through the speaker when I was ordering. Seen children inside the store in the back running into and out of the office. Most of the time I don't care because Christmas time parties are nice but Corona😐😬😳.</Text>

<Text>Out visiting a friend and needed a late night snack.  Very dissappointed that the fries were cold. If nothing else Micky D's, make sure the fries are ALWAYS hot. The service was not swift and not any greeting at the window. The cashier was very bland in his tone, no repeating the order, just gave the total and gave my change. No exchange or greeting. Not sure why the drive thru was so backed up, but by the time I got to the 2nd window food was ready and we took off. It was at the light that I reached my hand in the bage and suffered the disappointment of barely warm French fries. I really wanted to turn back around but the line was even longer than when I first pulled up. So I just waited and heated them back up when I got to my friends. It was nearly 11pm when we arrived, but cold fries are never acceptable and will cost this location stars and eventually my business.</Text>< Pics>

They automatically accept all orders from Eats, even when they are unable to fullfill them (like ordering between 3am and 4am from the dinner menu). Then, they never cancel the order that cannot be fulfilled, but instead waste the time of both the customer and the delivery person with a live order that never gets processed.<//Text>

Fisrt she came to take my order with a bad aditud.

Secondable she missed my #6 burger
I realized till i was home and this is not the fisrt time they messed up. Probabbly not coming back to this place they have some lazy people that doedn't know how to do their job right....

I know is just a simple burger but when it comes to customer service i think they should be better then that...</review>< pics>

The fries and ice cream cones are awesome. All the food was always hot and cooked well. Very inexpensive and you get a lot for your money and it will easily fill you up.<//review>

<text>Make sure to always check your order when they pass it to you.  Be prepared to wait longer than usual if you use the mobile app for ordering. They recently renovated for electronic ordering and put in a second drive-thru lane,  see the attached photo which claims any lane any time,  except as you can see,  not when I snapped this photo after waiting in a queue for 20mins to get to this point.  This sums up recent experiences with the Chestnut St location!</text><gmap_id>0x808fa3a8bfdc3291:0x2270807b1f6067c9</gmap_id>< UserId.>

Never usually leave reviews but this is probably the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. Slow service, can't order from the counter (tell you to f off and use the self checkout), and employee's don't even pretend to care. Been here at least 5 times and haven't had a single positive experience. Receipts never print and mess up my order half the time as well. Literally less than half of the staff speak English.</Review>

<rating>3</rating><text>What's the point of using an automated kiosk to take your order if it doesn't print the order receipt to take to the counter? Why would an employee, after being told that the kiosk didn't print the order receipt, make a new transaction instead of looking up the fully-customized meal I had already made? I wonder these things as I eat my pickle-laced, skimped-onions-and-ketchup disappointment of a hamburger.<//text>< Pics>

The employees were quite rude. Including the manager. If you ask any additional creamer's, sugars or returned food. That was poorly prepared and taste horrible. Their attitude towards you was rude and intimidating. I also observed two other additional customers receiving the incorrect orders and being treated the same way I was treated.  One customer had not received a tea bag with her tea just hot water and came in and asked for the tea bag.  They insisted they giving her the tea bag and after 5 minutes they finally gave her the tea bag.  What horrible customer service. These employees need to go to a training session including the manager.< /text>

<text>OMG I don't know what to say the only thing I know I spend 20 minutes on this small line for order, the lady who was behind me she was on her lunch break and sadly she have to go back without lunch that broke my heart. But the manager is a sweetheart she was trying very hard to make it the solution in order to make it the customers happy, unfortunately it's not only one in that place they need a quality team to make it better!< /text>< pics>

Pressure you to order when you aren't ready but to be fair many places do. Soda machines were out of many flavors and ones they did have didn't taste good at all! Also like my soda without ice and every where else I get it that way it's cold not this McDonald's they have room temperature soda. Only ate nuggets which were a little hard but pretty good< /Review>

<Text>Food is usually pretty good, especially if you show up when it's busy bc they have to keep making things fresh. The wait isn't too bad and the staff has always been mostly friendly, though a bit distracted. The only complaint is that I have a lot of kids so I usually order big, and every time I come, they always forget at least one thing from my order, sometimes getting it wrong completely. They fix it without complaint but can be frustrating after the third time it's happened< /Text>< Pictures>

Lmfao I thought it was pretty cool that 3 of the staff panicked when the menu machine interface thing didn’t print my receipt and the 2 of them were explaining through 1 translator about I don’t know because they weren’t explaining anything really and just gave me my coffee. I am extremely confused from this experience it’s actually hilarious. 1 star because this McDonald’s is run by a ghost crew. Nobody is actually staffed here. Lmfao</Text>

Now they try to get you to order electronically when you walk in. After 5 minutes of fooling around with the board you can't complete the order. Then you try to order from the person on the counter who barely speaks English. Finally after multiple voids on the register he got that I wanted a filet of fish with no cheese, and a strawberry sundae. Pretty simple order, I thought.</Text>

Stopped by late, and nobody was answering the drive-thru. The people in front of us were being served, but we were told at the window that the restaurant was understaffed and not able to take orders. Needs better staffing.< /review>

<Review>To McDonald's on Chestnut in redwood City the people there are so rude they refused to help you even if you don't know how to read are you don't know how to use the kiosk machine to place an order they will stand there and push the buttons for you then you have to walk across to pay if you have cash it is really ridiculous that somebody cannot help you with your order unless you use the kiosk machine I hope people start getting fired for not helping the elderly and forcing them to use a kiosk machine bad customer service just because I have to give them a star they get one not none 😡😡😡</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I asked for breakfast bacon egg mcmuffin they say no bacon. Thing is there are plenty of burgers with bacon that you can order any time of day. I guess maybe there's a rookie at the register. Then they give my order to someone else. Monday huh?</text>

<Review>It is a nice looking place, but employees don't know how to keep it clean. Bathrooms are always smelly. In this location you will find lots of homeless inside asking for money and even on the drive Tru. Homeless people use the restrooms to clean themselves and spent lots of time in there. This sucks for parents with kids because we must take them to the bathroom. Also is hard to wash your hands because homeless are washing their body and won't give you permitió to wash heands. Plus who would? Knowing that the whole sink area is contaminated. I would recomendamos this place for drive Tru only.<//Review></record>

<Review>Worst service ever. Worst attitude. They hire thee most unmotivated people ever. I have had only 2 worker be curteous and we'll mannered. As I'm asking the manager something she begins to walk away ignore me and chit chat to her employees in spanish vulgar things about the customers, not knowing that I speak spanish. I'm literally yelling to get their attention and they still ignore. I've tried multiple times for them to give me corporates phone number (as a test to see if they would) and they say they don't know it or give me a wrong number. Many times by a manager. I will be making a formal complaint to the higher ups because it is embarrassing and unbelievable that this place has not have had an overhaul or been shut down.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) The manager has bad attitude, she doesn't have no manners, she doesn't know how to smile to the costumers and be nice, she needs to be more polite and I mean more polite I dont know how many managers u got in this place but they need to change their attitude, I personally work for 15 years in a fast food restaurant and I never saw such a bad attitude as many people have, for me personally they need to go to classes to know how to treat customers because we as clients are the ones who pay their salaries

(Translated by Google) Very bad today I was early 6:10 am and a lady who works at the window did not want to attend to me as I can not use the robotic makina they have there she did not want to receive the order I told me to know my order in the makina if I wanted I was taken care of I went to the Cosina fence employees who have in that MC that lady lacks training by MC so you do not attend to a client no more because you can not use the robotic makina you leave it by only abating your luck the client does not She has the training to use the robotic makina as the employees that lady is already doing it to me 3 times it is not the first time to start MC is a millionaire franchise you should think that if you have a worker like that in your business talk to her to see how improve your attitude it is assumed that if you work in cashier or window your dever is to serve with kindness not only leave the customer very bad service of that MC should the driver better watch their cameras and watch that his e mpleada on saturdays

Muy mal hoy fui temprano 6:10 am i una  señora de las que trabaja en ventanilla no me quiso atender como no puedo usar la makina robotizada que tienen ahí no me quiso recibir la orden I me dijo que isiera mi orden en la makina si quería yo ser atendido I se fue para la Cosina valla empleados que tienen en ese  MC esa señora le falta entrenamiento por parte de MC así no atiendes a un cliente no más porque no puede usar la makina robótica lo dejas ablando solo a su suerte  el cliente no tiene el entrenamiento de usar la makina robótica como los empleados esa  señora ya me lo va aciendo 3 veces no es la primera vez  para empezar MC es una franquicia millonaria deveria de pensar que si tienes una trabajadora así en tu negocio abla con ella para ver cómo mejora su actitud  se supone que si trabajas en de cajera o ventanilla tu dever es servir con amabilidad no dejar solo al cliente muy mal servicio de ese MC deberían el manejador vijilar mejor sus cámaras i vijilarse a esa su empleada de los sábados< /Review>
