Although I do not partake, my Lady does.   I contacted them, asked about delivery, they explained the whole thing step by step...   a few text messages later the driver met us, professional and courteous.. very easy.. and from what I see, a GOOD value as well..  I recommend them to anyone and everyone..  we will definitely be a regular customer..  Thank you for providing us with this service.<//Review>

<text>This place is great. Was visiting from out of town and didn’t have a car. I placed my order online and was promptly contacted by the shop. They texted to confirm the order and everything was ultra smooth. Would absolutely use them again and would urge anyone else to try them.</text>< Response>

Store is closed and non existing. Address takes you to a lovely plaza. I called several time which went to voice-mail. No information about being closed or a new location.  Very disappointed.<//review>

Asked the gentleman to hold for one second because i was rudely chewing in his ear and he hung up on me. They most definitely must make good money that they can hang up on people. I apologize for chewing in your, but thank you for showing me it was best not to do business with you.</review>

So I placed an order for my son and met up with Brandon. I got home and received a call from them letting me know they gave me the wrong. Order, I didn't know because I didn't know check my son was just happy to get it. They asked if I mined to meet up with them again. They. Totally hooked me up way over compensated,they are so honest and respectful I recommend them highly they are awesome people.

Love this place and their Menu. They always have exactly what I need. My favorite one right now is the Wedding Crashers. This sativa LITERALLY makes me want to crash a wedding! As an anxious person I always worry if a strain is going to make me paranoid or socially awkward. NO WORRY HERE—-this sh*t makes me social! I did feel a kick of energy too. Great if you still have things to do or people to talk to. A great balance of getting what needs to be done and wanting to do it in a very uplifted, self-motivated way.  A very crystallized nug too! It’s tentacles are more glittery than a twilight tee shirt from 2011. I absolutely LOVE this strain! 10/10 would recommend.<//Review>

Chronic Solutions has been a great resource for me living in Temecula. The quality of the product has always been top shelf. Drivers are on time and friendly. This is a great alternative in place of driving 20 30 minutes each way from here to a dispensary. Thank you chronic Solutions for assisting in my pain management.< /text>

Great delivery service–always on top of it whenever I order. They are quick to give different options I may like, are always on time, and very friendly. I recommend anyone to order from here if you are thinking about it. Thank you Chronic Solutions for being so reliable!<//Review>

I meant to leave a review when I first ordered from them a couple weeks ago but I got so consumed in my goodies 🙈 and sadly forgot. Of course now that I’m ready for more they are the first people I would hit up because not only were they the nicest guys ever but they turned me on to the mango cbd and I can never go back. It literally is the perfect daytime high just as Ruben explained. Brandon showed up with my order so quick and was friendly and professional. They are without a doubt my go to from now on, I am so glad I stumbled upon chronic!< /Text>

We love Ohana!! There are lots of vets in Tracy, but we drive to Livermore to see Dr Hacker for all of our boy's needs. Doc absolutely loves how she comes in and gets straight in the floor with him. They are absolutely wonderful!<//review>

I have been on the Dr Steffes hype for some time since my family has used him for many small exotics so when my cat was very sick, he was the man I thought of first!

My cat had issues her entire life with chronic respiratory infections and low platelets and other things.  My usual vet sort of said “eh shes old and will die soon” but I wasn’t going to agree with that... I mean, my grandma is old too, should I stop taking her to the doctors?

Anyway, I emailed back and forth initially, almost with instant responses, and was scheduled to come in.  When I got there, only one other person was there at the time.  When I met with Dr Steffes, he noticed that my cat was walking around exploring the room and instead of stressing her more by forcing her to be up on the table, he laid on the floor with her and spent time listening to her breathe, and watching the way her chest moved.  When he told me what he thought with her history and medications she had been on, he gave me a couple of hypotheticals. I asked, “what would you do if this was your cat?” And he gave me an answer.  It was so heart warming and positive in spirit and he gave her lots of love, too.

I don’t know if he knew I was struggling or his prices were just so acceptable, but the visit and medication seemed appropriately priced, and not like he was trying to pay off med school with my income alone... I was so delighted even though I was crying like a baby.

Blackie went on to live about 2 more years.. she was my best friend, and I miss her tons.  We need more doctors like Dr Steffes!<//Text>

Highly recommended! Took my dog here for stomach problems and received excellent service. Dr. Jennifer Hacker took the time to collect all the info she needed to determine the correct care plan. She was knowledgeable, thoughtful, friendly and amazing with animals. Care was provided on the spot in a very acceptable time period, outcomes were revised with me, and the pricing was very reasonable. Highly recommended!!<//Text>

<Review>Both Dr. Steffes and Dr. Hacker are fantastic.  Most of my interactions have been with Dr. Steffes, and he does it all:

* He's always relaxed and my kittens (who can be skittish with strangers) always quickly warm up to him.
* Obviously he's knowledeable, but even better, he's eager to explain all the possibilities and is very clear with his communication.
* He has just a very nice personality, and can quickly put me at ease even in stressful situations (regarding the pet I'm bringing in for the visit).

Beyond Dr. Steffes, the entire staff (literally every single person I've met there) are warm and positive people that just makes me happy to call this vet my permanent home for such services.< /Review><user>103029931440149593507</user><date>1579648320436<//date>< Name>

<text>I brought in my rabbit for GI Stasis (for those that don't know rabbits, GI Stasis can be deadly even with a day or two without treatment). I called around to several vets recommended for rabbits, and no one had any availability. Ohana squeezed in an appointment for him even though the vet, Zachary Steffes, was busy. Even though he *was* busy, he did a thorough check and took the time to explain his theories to me (it can be hard to determine a cause of Stasis), and gave me several options on treatment to add to what I was already doing. He also gave recommendations of further/future testing to uncover a possible trigger for chronic Stasis. He was very knowledgeable of various conditions and illnesses affecting rabbits and was also understanding of our budget. I made an appointment for my other bunny and my tortoise for their wellness checks. We just moved here about a year ago and hadn't established a vet yet, but I am definitely going to come back here.

UPDATE: I've now been back several times and Dr. Steffes is absolutely the best!< /text><Response>None< /Response>< user_name>

<Review>I was very impressed with the facility and staff. After taking my pets to Bishop Ranch Vet hospital for years and feeling like my pets were just a number I really missed the one on one relationship that a smaller practice offers. I felt comfortable wit Dr Zachary Steffes right away. He treated my sons $12 hamster like it really mattered to him because I believe it did. I will be taking all my animals there  in the future when needs arise.< /Review>< Resp>

<Time>1566769494433</Time><rating>5<//rating><review>Hands down Dr Steffes is the best vet I have had in years!!!!

My wife and I used to live next door to Ohana when they opened. We have since moved to Stockton, but I will drive 2 hours one way in rush hour traffic to bring our Aussie Newton and Border Collie Winston!

Their offices are large, new and very clean. The staff is very professional. More importantly Dr Steffes does not over charge for teeth cleaning and other services. Their rates are fair. Through 30 years of owning different pets I can’t tell you how many times I had to put off teeth cleaning 3-4 years because it was too expensive. Not so w this office, the price is right and fair every time allowing to clean my dog’s teeth every 2 years and ensure their long term health.

Also their shots rate is good along w emergency services prices.

Let me tell you, as someone who had a dog die (French Bulldog) during a routine procedure at PETCO due to PETCO’s staff inexperience and negligence.....don’t try to save 5-10% off your bill to save a buck. Your pet may not survive the PetSmart/PETCO visit.

You want to be at a full fledged Vet Office like Ohana, for all services where Dr Steffes and his wife have years of training and experience along w a fully equipped hospital w fully trained staff!

Won’t switch from this office if you paid me. Dr Steffes is the best!< /review>< Pics>

They are patient with them and I have never felt rushed during my appointment with either one of them. They don't pressure you into things but recommend the very best care which I love.

Both Dr. Hacker and Dr. Steffes are caring and knowledgeable vets.  Their state of the art hospital is one of the best I've ever seen.   I highly recommend you bring your pet of any kind to them!<//review>

Preparing for my cat to have delicate eye surgery to remove a large cyst-like growth on his eyelid. I have been so stressed over having this surgery. I researched every hospital and took him in for several opinions at different places.  After visiting OHANA'S website and calling them, after just two calls I was convinced that this is who I would entrust my cat's surgery to. I'm so relieved to have found them.Thank you OHANA ANIMAL HOSPITAL.</Text>

<user_name>Design State of Mind< /user_name><review>Very impressed with the honesty in options for making a decision in related to an issue with my dog.  Most Vets would have given only costly options that are in favor of the clinic, that was not the case with Ohana.  I would recommend Ohana Animal Hospital to everyone I know.< /review></record>

Rabbit doctors are not easy to find.  My last one left and I have been searching.  I Give Ohana a 5 star rating.  Dr. Steffes is knowledgeable, and  really takes the time to go over any concerns.  He won't push any treatments not needed and best of all is reasonably priced!!!!!  You just can't find a better bunny doctor.  He also has 3 bunnies himself so you know he loves everything about them and will treat these sensitive guys with care.  I live in San Ramon and won't hesitate to make the trip to Livermore to see him.  I am so happy to have found Ohana Animal Hospital.</Text>

Dr Steffes and Dr Hacker have seen all of our dogs and cats over the years. Their compassion, patience, and kindness has helped us through many difficult situations. I wouldn't trust anyone else to care for my babies and I am so grateful for Dr Steffes and Dr Hacker! ❤ Highly recommend for any and all pets in the family!</review>

<text>I liked Ohana from the first time I set foot in there.  Now, I love them and am so glad I chose them over the many Vetenary offices in Livermore.  Dr. Steffes helped us with our 10 year old Mutt, Morgan, when she stopped eating.  Through out the last 6 months, he did everything he could to get her to eat.  For a while she was better, then went down hill very fast.  The whole time, Dr. Steffes did his best to help keep costs down.  It has now been almost 3 weeks since Morgan's passing.  We received Morgan's paw print in clay and a card, that was personalized by everyone who had seen Morgan.  Our last vet had seen one of dogs since puppy hood and didn't even send a generic card.</text><Date>1509590705952</Date></record></dataset><record>

Wow - what a great practice!  I've got pit bulls & my big boy can be kind of a jerk toward strangers, & especially toward men.  While mentioning my concerns to my contractor (also a pittie-lover) he referred me to his sister's practice at Ohana Animal Hospital.  I'm so pleased!

The reception & waiting room is beautifully calm & the techs so considerate to my touchy anxious boy - providing grain-free treats for his cranky tummy.  Dr, Hacker won over my dog in a matter of moments & while a little tense, he was a very good boy during his exam & blood draws.

The love, care, & sensitivity shown toward my dog & his great response to the staff have sealed the deal - Nikabrik has found his new doctor!  Bonus: Dr. Steffes treats rabbits!  Now my buns will have an doctor close to home who understands their temperments & special needs.

If you're looking for a new veterinary practice, I highly recommend Ohana!< /review>

10/10 would come again! After hearing there was an exotic Doc in the area I was so relieved. My little guinea pig wasn't acting like hersef and grew big Ol' hips. There's nothing wrong with some junk in the trunk but this was surprising. I brought candy (my guinea pig) in to see Dr. Steffes. He put the fancy dancy live X-ray machine on her and found cysts. I was beside myself with worry but Dr. Steffes said we would monitor it. I've never met anyone so knowledgeable with guinea pig medicine. I'll be sure to bring my milk snake, Winkie in to get a check up ASAP.<//Review>

Quick summery: You will not be able to find a more caring vet than Dr. Steffes. Feel free bring your animal here with zero worries about the quality of care and attention you will receive.

Long Story: We met Dr. Steffes back in March of 2016. We had a bearded dragon Falcor that was going through some medical distress and was referred over to Zach. After bringing in Falcor for an examination it was obvious that she was suffering from very unique and strange medical problems. He had to drain fluid from around her heart, and it was sent off to be tested. Over the next few weeks Dr. Steffs ran multiple tests, provided us with a feeding and medication plan, kept in contact via email and phone, and made himself available appointments at the hospital when needed. Zach also took the time to explain all of the medical issues, possible complications and answer any questions we had about them or treatment options.

At no point did Dr Steffes give us anything but courteous and caring service, even though I am sure we imposed more than we should have on his time. Our bearded dragon was suffering from more than one aliment and ultimately died, but when she passed we knew that there was absolutely nothing else that could have been done for her, and because of the care she received we were able to enjoy her company far longer than without.

But it was not just Falcor that received excellent treatment. Our Chinchillas, cats and dogs all came to Dr. Steffes if there was a need and every one of them was treated with love and care while with him. I would feel comfortable giving any animal to his care and recommend him without any reservations to anyone that is looking for quality vet care.< /review>

Wonderful, trustworthy service. Installing a water softener was the best decision. I wish more people had told me it was important to test and consider much earlier. My pipes and bathroom fixtures thank me and my hair is soft again!Billing is easy, service is regular and they work really hard not to mess up the plants I set up to hide the system. I cannot recommend Kitzman's Culligan enough.< /review>

Great experience! From the initial consultation, through the install, the team at Kitzman's Culligan was on-time, polite and professional. And we are loving quality of the treated water -- a huge improvement over what we were using before!</review>

We have been Kitzman's Culligan customers for about 10 years now, utilizing their water-softening service. We enjoy the ease of the service - since they take care of it for you by replacing the tanks as needed. Their customer service is fantastic! They are always so friendly and ready to help or answer any questions that I have. Thank you Kitzman's Culligan!<//review>

It was easy to set up a visit with your technician. He explained very well the water problem and made good recommendations. The installation went smoothly and deliveries of the filtration tank come on time as scheduled. I get a text message from Kitzman a couple of days before the next tank delivery giving me the option to go ahead or skip the delivery. Every month I get an email with the invoice with at least a 3 week due date. Great company!</Review>

<Review>We’ve been customers for 5 years or so and have both the water softener system and the water filtration. We are very happy with the services. The techs that come out are helpful and courteous. We had a leaky sink that caused the auto shut-off to kick in on the under sink water filtration (as it should work) and I called for assistance. They were out later that day, quickly fixed the problem. I highly recommend Kitzman’s.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I have had the services of Kitzman Culligan for many years.
The reverse water tastes so much better than tap water and I have often had guests tell me how much better my water tasted than theirs.
Also I have Culligan soft water in my house which makes my laundry softer, especially bedding and towels, and my cloths come out of the dryer mostly wrinkle free! I would highly recommend getting Kitzman Culligan in your home.</Review><GmapID>0x80ece19fdfdb7bff:0x880f6f46ed72bfaf</GmapID><username>Gari Cave<//username><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Cheaper than most other places. Their machines take $5 bills which is great when you have 10 or more gallons to get. You can feed the machine for the next bottle while it fills, which saves time. Filling bottles isn't a great experience, but Culligan make it as painless as possible.< /Text></record>

We were so thrilled to call Kitzman Culligan who had a “real person” answering the phone and responding right away!

<text>Kitzman's Culligan is a wonderful company to work with.  I have lived here in Cambria for 24 years and have had soft water service the entire time at my personal home through this company. Also, as a property manager, several of the rental properties I manage are set up with their wonderful soft water tank exchange service. The entire staff is knowledgeable, courteous and goes out of their way to be helpful.  I highly recommend Kitzman's Culligan Water for any of your soft water needs..</text>< Pics>

<Text>We've been using Kitzman's Culligan service for about a year now and couldn't be happier with it! Culligan has improved our lives in so many ways. First, to clarify: this is not salt softened water! It is highly filtered water, a big difference. We ordered it right after we installed new dishwasher (3rd in 6 years) and washing machines. Water here in Cambria is extremely hard, so we called Culligan to help our new appliances work better and longer. Aced that! Next, my skin. Dry, flakey, itchy and unhappy. We had installed shower filters already, which helped some, but Culligan's whole house filtered water system is worlds better and my hair is way softer and cleaner. Add to that the high quality, double filtered drinking water, and the now spot free stainless steel sink and faucets and life is good in our little domicle! Oh, i can't forget the service - Kitz-men are polite, efficient and excellent installers. No problem at all. Thank you Kitzman's Culligan!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1516215536797, 'text': 'Wow! All your specifics about your dishwasher, washing machine, sinks and faucets being cleaner and better are what we continually talk to people about in the community.  Culligan Water really makes a  night and day difference!  To be honest, I don\'t believe anyone would go without conditioned soft and drinking water if they knew what they were missing.\nThen your comment about how amazing the skin and hair improvement is so important.  Last and definitely not least is the water you put IN your body.  Great drinking water has too many quality of life and health benefits to list here.\nI will share your note with our staff.  Our Kitzman\'s Culligan company vision is "Improving lives through better water."  I am so pleased, and they will be too, that we are accomplishing that aim and improving your life!

<Text>I was really pleased with how quickly Kitzman responded to the problem we had with our RO system that had developed a leak.  The RO system had been  installed by another contractor several years ago.  Dan arrived the same day as my call and expertly repaired the leak and tested the quality of the water which was in the right range.  All for a very reasonable price.  Dan also let me know that I could bring water samples into Kitzman in MB for future testing at no cost.  I could not be more pleased with the service call.</Text></record>

<text>Very soon after the request to get help getting salt into our storage tank, we noticed 2 more bags of salt left near the spa by our back stairs!  This has happened more than twice.  We have been unable to get them into the tank as it is too full and they will have to stay there until we find someone to help lift the bags up to the top of our water softner tank inside the laundry after it is low on salt.<//text><user_name>Terri L Anderson< /user_name>< Pictures>

<resp>{'time': 1501277393542, 'text': 'George,\nThat soft water shower is pretty great!  Many people assume a squeaky feel after bathing in hard water is clean skin, but it is really the opposite.  That sticky feeling (or squeaky) is a film of soap scum or curd that is left on the skin from the hard water and soap combination.\nWith soft water, the lack of hardness particles allows soap to suds up quickly with much less soap or shampoo and then and leaves no soap scum on your skin or hair.  So enjoy that great Culligan soft water, and we appreciate you choosing Culligan.\nRob'}< /resp>< gmapID>

<text>Went down to mattress firm after my friend highly recommended them to us.  Howard was great. Real Salt of the earth guy.  He took the time to  interact with not only me and my wife but our 4 kids too.   He was on top of everything and took the time to listen to our wants and needs and we ended up finding the perfect bed.  10/10 would recommend seeing Howard if your looking for a new bed<//text></record>

<Text>I didn't purchase anything here since they didn't have any mattress toppers available at the store when I visited. Nevertheless, the associate who assisted us was so professional, friendly, and helpful. She still helped us figure out where to go to find toppers in stock at nearby stores. I'll definitely come back to this location for my next mattress purchase.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>The customer service here is Amazing!   I did not feel rushed or pushed to buy any of their products. Howard was very helpful and knowledgeable in the bed I was looking at getting. They made sure I was happy with my purchase. I brought my 3 year old with me who was tired and cranky and I Believe her name was Lisa (sorry if I got the name wrong) she watched him for me while completing the purchase. They also brought out markers for him. They are all very nice here and welcoming. Very Family friendly. I Highly recommend buying your bed here!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Outstanding friendly customer sales and service by Sean and Mia. We walked into the showroom needing new mattresses for our guest bedrooms; spent a couple of hours. They really do care on what you’re purchasing and very knowledgeable of the product they sell!</Text>

<Text>Lisa was amazing! It was my first time buying a mattress, and she made the process super easy. She really was advocating the best for us and not just trying to sell us. Totally wanted to make sure we were making an informed decision and wasn’t pressuring at all. We just got our bed delivered and love it! :)</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< user_name>

Howard was very knowledgeable about all the products, and helped us understand and ultimately make a decision. He is very entertaining and open to share who he is and shows a high level of salesmanship.
We had called the store earlier to check on store times and Lisa answered the phone with a great attitude. During our time in the store I witnessed her working with other customers and was impressed with her helpful attitude. I was also impressed when she went through the store and disinfected everything.<//text>

Howard was very informative and patient. He also got me a really good deal for 2 pillows, mattress and bed frame. I will definitely recommend him to my friends.</text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>We were a bit hesitant given the look of the exterior of the building when approaching. However, after working with Kevin we would not go anywhere else to buy a mattress again. Kevin was incredibly knowledgeable, helpful, transparent, and an absolute pleasure to work with. If there’s a takeaway from my review, it should be that Kevin should be getting a raise because he truly MAKES the sale for being himself.<//review>< user_id>

I am not sure what the gentleman's name was, but he was very nice and I felt very personable. It was a nice family experience. We will be back for future mattresses.</review>< Pictures>

Lisa did an amazing job of showing us the mattresses and explaining the differences. we went in just to look, but her knowledge and help finding the right deals, including price matching help with a mattress we already wanted and found a good deal on, made us ready to buy two on the spot. She was easy to talk to and didn’t pressure us at all. I will be recommending all my friends to go to her for their next purchase.<//text>

After putting off looking for a new bed for far too long, my boyfriend and I decided to see what Labor Day sales might have to offer us this year. We did some research online and found a mattress we liked at MattressFirm. We headed to MattressFirm located at 5891-B Lone Tree Way, Antioch to see if we could check it out in person. Upon entering the store, we were pleasantly greeted by Kanna P. who welcomed us in and asked what brought us in. We go over the whys and whats, never feeling pressured to go further without really understanding our wants/needs. Unfortunately, the specific mattress we saw online was not available on the showroom floor. Kanna did everything she could to show us comparable mattresses, always revisiting the focus points we discussed earlier. Again, no rushing and no pressure to buy. She was honest with pricing, what they could/could not offer, and didn't try to upsell us to another size or price range. The process was painless and a positive retail experience. The other employees present, Raj and Juan, were also very welcoming and pleasant. They made it a point to speak to myself and my boyfriend with respect and not as another $. I am glad I chose this location as there are 2-3 in my general area and I'm fairly confident we wouldn't have had the same shopping/buying experience at one of the others.< /text>

<text>Howard was absolutely AWESOME!!! He’s a long time family friend and when I realized we needed something at his store it was a no brainer to call him for help. He jumped to the task, was thorough, quick and full of humour throughout the entire process. I wouldn’t hesitate to send anyone to Mattress Firm, two thumbs up, and make sure you ask for The Warrior! 👍🏻👍🏻< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1608570785971, 'text': 'Thank you Jade.

I received the absolute best customer service yesterday from Tishshawna Clayton at the Long Tree store in Antioch, CA. I even left my cell phone and she went above and beyond to make sure I got my phone back. Great customer service and it’s finest. I truly had an amazing experience and I will  continue to use Mattress Firm if this is the dedication your employees serve with. You made my day Ms. Clayton!<//review>

<Review>I had been looking for a new mattress.  I looked online for a while and felt   I needed to see and feel one so many different choices.  I ended up at Mattress Firm in Antioch Lone Tree Wy.  I was greeted by Juan F.  He helped me look at my choices.  I finally picked one his recommendations were wonderful.  I needed the delivery and haul off.  He made sure I was able to get this on the bed I had chosen.  Everything was set up and done.  I was very happy with my service by Juan.  I really like that Mattress Firm has a nice selection to match your budget.  Very happy with my A+ Service.  Thank you !<//Review><time>1604355002422<//time>< user_name>

<Text>My experience is a unique one, meaning the reason I had to purchase a new mattress. I came home from work one day and my dogs had tore open a feather bed I had. There were feathers everywhere.  So I went on Google and asked "mattress store near me". After that I met with the sales person, who was very nice. I told him what I needed , he showed me what he had, and made sure its a mattress that I could take home the same day. I had no problems.</Text><Date>1603676770628< /Date>< rate>

I’m a little surprise that I’m being ask for a review considering I haven’t received my new mattress yet. However, I can comment on the personal service I received.
The sales rep (Lisa Pressgrove) made it a pleasant experience. She answered all my questions and made sure I was satisfied with her answers. I was most impressed with her patience and willingness to make sure I would be happy with my decision. I really felt like a valued customer!</review>

<Text>I had the best experience ever at Mattress Firm on Lone Tree way in  Antioch.  My salesman's name was Juan Flores.  He was awesome! He was extremely knowledgeable and informative. I could tell he was smart...was totally up on his anatomy and physiology and how the bed I picked out would help my husband neck and back. I recommend this place for anyone looking to purchase a new matress. Our only problem now is that we don't wanna get out of our King sized temperpedic with adjustable head and legs... Totally worth the investment.  Will only buy from Juan in the future.</Text>< pictures>

My experience at mattress firm was nothing short of 5 star service . Howard was the customer service rep that took care of me and showed me the way to purchasing my new bed . This gentleman was attentive to what I wanted out of a new bed,  and knew just where to look . I highly recommend anyone go see him at your next visit if your interested in a new bed . Thank you Howard for your amazing customer service and I will definitely be referring business your way or coming back in the future because of you.<//Review>

5 out of 5! Haven't purchased a mattress in over 10 years and was super happy with my experience at this Mattress Firm off Lone Tree by Lumpy's.  Raj and Juan were very welcoming and had me testing every single bed before making my purchase. They made this process so great and super easy!  Thank you both!</Review>

Good evening,
Today i had the pleasure of meeting Howard at your Antioch location. from the moment I walked in the store he made me feel welcomed and at home. He took his time to explain and show me all the beds this store has. Howards world class Hospitality is one you don't see often. I work for Southwest so seeing someone match our costumer service was world class. Idk who his boss is but he is truly a blessing to have. I appreciate the guidance he gave me on my new bed. Howard made me feel well worth every penny I just spent. Thank you again Mattress Firm for hiring a great worker in Howard. We are now friends!!!!!

Thank you,

Johnathan Secrease< /Text>

Great service!!! My family has bought cars, beds and now an adjustable base from Howard. He has the same passion today, as he did 35 years ago, when was donating his time announcing YMI lobball  for  my husbands games. He is not only my salesman but he is a friend as well. If anybody in the Antioch Brentwood Oakley area is looking for a mattress or an adjustable base,Please buy from Howard. So many disingenuous people in the sales industry, but we always trust Howard. Thank you Howard for your honesty and always taking care of my family.< /Review>

I had the best service. Kanna helped me to pick out the best mattress for me. She asked me questions about my sleep habits and showed me beds that was best fit for me. She also told me about the guarantee and warranty, along with what to do when I get my mattress. I was just so happy when I left. The price was way better then I planned and I am lucky enough to get the mattress the next day. I couldn’t be any happier.<//review>

Had an amazing experience at Mattress Firm, with Kim. She was very knowledgeable and patient, allowing my wife, 3 year old daughter and I to test the mattress based on our sleeping habits made the experience worth it. Kim helped us figure out what was the best mattress for us and allowed us to compare it with others. At no point did Kim pressure us in any fashion..Awesome experience! The Johnson family would like to personally thank Kim again for all her help.< /review>

<review>Purchased and had delivery next day. Delivered on time and very polite. There was a problem with the base not functioning and they called the warehouse to troubleshoot the problem. When they could not get it to work, they assured us that they would be back the NEXT DAY to replace it.......and they came back first thing! Very professional! I would recommend Mattress firm to everyone. Thanks again for the awesome service!</review>< Time>

<review>Stopped by to look at a queen size mattress,  get pricing and spoke with Vanessa who showed me a mattress and box spring in the price range I was looking for, Vanessa gave me such a great deal. I left feeling like a valued customer and happy that I purchased my mattress set from Mattress Firm. Thank you Vanessa!< /review><GmapID>0x808ff8b877684225:0x5ea01454706479a8< /GmapID><rate>5< /rate><UserId.>108810539817399393015</UserId.><response>None</response>< Time>

I made the mistake of picking the wrong bed even tho we were told to go for a medium. The exchange was sooooo painless. Went in and told them I wanted something a bit firmer and paid the $80 restocking fee. Now we’re happy with our new pick. Def recommend these guys. They were very willing to work with us.</Text>< Pictures>

I had never purchased a bed before, I walked in there needing something for my sciatica pain. Juan, the sales rep, was very helpful, accommodating and knowledgeable. He talked me through what to look for, showed me a higher quality bed for a slight price increase, and I was in and out in less than an hour. The whole team was nice a friendly, the delivery was fast and punctual. This store is very recommended.<//review>

<Text>Just recently purchased a mattress from Matress firm. After going from store to store and sales person to sales person. I came across a heck of a guy named Dennis. From start to finish the service was A+. Mr. Dennis went above and beyond for me. Highly recommend him and the store to anyone looking for a bed!< /Text>< name>

We went in on a Sunday. The Gentleman met us at the door. I told him we were looking for a bed and we have a pretty low budget. He was really good and sold us a great bed for a good price. When he talked about an add on he could read my looks and didn't push. I really enjoyed the service. I get very nervous about spending money and if I feel pressured I am the type to leave. NO PRESSURE!< /Text>

We came looking for an in expensive mattress and had shopped two other stores first. We were going to settle for a mattress in our price range and they didn't have it in stock so the store sales person upgraded us for free and arranged delivery on short notice. Thanks so much<//Text>

This place sold me not one, not two, but three bundles of bad hair all claiming to be 💯 human hair with a price range of $300 - $500.
I was refunded for 2 purchases but not before the owner gave me a hard time stating and I quote "My expectations of the hair were too high" keep in mind the hair was not worn more than 3 days in the pictures.
Also they referred me to a gal for a weave that was a disaster on top of the bad hair.</Text>

<username>R G< /username><text>I found the staff here pretty knowledgeable. I was visiting this area and this beauty supply store was recommended to me. It had just as many products as the big city 2 hours away. Based on a recommendation from the Manager I bought 12 packs of hair which turned out to be the perfect amount for the 2 heads I needed to style.</text>< UserId.>

I heart Carol's!!!  They have everything for every type of hair. They stay stocked with braiding hair. Been going here for years. I drive to DHS just to got to Carol's. Same owner for all these years and pricing doesn't just go up. Pretty consistent.< /Text>

Literally the only store with absolutely the highest quality and quantity in the whole desert area. I tell everyone about this place since I looked EVERYWHERE and there is no store with any wig, hair, and all other supplies that looks good or isn't completely overpriced for trashy junk. This truly is the best and I refuse to purchase all my essentials anywhere else and gladly make the drive to there no matter how far out I am since I know I'm getting the best when I'm getting anything there. <3<//review>

This place had a lot of selections however I had questions about getting hair dye as I have never dyed my hair before and it took forever for one of the girls to even respond to me and ended up giving me the wrong stuff anyways don't know if I'll go back I might have better luck at Walmart< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Everything is always in order. I have been consuming my dye for many years here in this place. The manager is young and is a very nice person and always very kind. I don't remember her name, but I have known her from the beginning.

Super friendly staff, very accommodating, clean, and nice furniture and decor. I've literally run out of positive things to say and I want to say more. I dont normally find myself in La Habra but I think I have a new reason to. 10/10 a must try!</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Been here a couple of times. Their ribs (dry rubbed) are pretty good, and that brisket... I keep a photo of that brisket in my wallet, and on sad times, I look at the photo and it brings the good memories of that 18-hour smoked meat.< /Text>< pics>

The only Mongolian place we go to! Amazing service and the veg is always fresh. And the pita bread is to die for.</Text>

<Text>Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love the authenticity of this Mongolian BBQ place. I’ve been coming here for a long time. This last visit was slightly different. I always use one bowl but the way I position my food I always get my money’s worth. I noticed both the cook and the gentleman (son) that rings up the food always look at me as I’m stacking my food in 1 bowl especially today. I finished and handed my food to the cook and went to pay. Although this isn’t a huge amount they decided to charge me an additional 0.50 cents funny thing is this guy always tells me the price and today he didn’t. Grabs my card and swipes it. Me being the person I am noticing small things I decided to go back and look at my recent visits to this place and all were $11.00 so I decided to ask him why I’m being charged an additional 0.50 cents. Is it because I stack my food? He tripped over his words and told me some story about next week the prices are changing and that’s pretty funny since I’m being charged more today because your prices are changing next week?? Doesn’t make any sense. I told him he should tell people if the prices are changing. The prices aren’t changing at all I guarantee that. It’s just because of the stacking which by the way it’s as much food as you can fit in a bowl. Long story short technically they can charge what they want but if your not equal across the board technically that’s they type of S*** that can get you a lawsuit And close your business down. I remember when this place was like $9. Wish they didn’t do that today because I’ve been a great customer for a long time and the principle of all of this just made me not want to go eat at this place again. I almost asked the customers in the business how much they paid for the meal they were eating but it wasn’t worth it. They have shown me what I needed to see already and that’s unfortunate. The owner should really think about stuff like this before doing them. Just be careful everyone apparently they can charge you more when they feel like you are getting more.< /Text>< GmapID>

< Review>
Sorry to see Our long time family fave for years has closed down. We'll miss the BEST mongolian bbq☹. 5 stars is not only for the great $ & service but also for the taste and quality of food and value for your dollar. They offered 4 meat choices plus shrimp, lots of vegetable choices, 3 sauces-lobster, kung pao and soy, sesame oil, white wine, minced garlic, ginger, chili paste. Your meal included: rice, soup and hot bread pockets. Other mongolian places we tried years before can't hold a torch to this place.
I'm hoping the new place opening up at this address will be the same taste, quality and value for the price.< /Review>

The pockets are good, but only if they've just been freshly made, otherwise hard and dry. The staff is...I. would say, not unfriendly, but just quiet. They are quite accommodating if you ask them for anything though.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Good food for a great price. Their sauces are especially good. I liked the lobster sauce. They brought out egg rolls, egg drop soup and rice to go with the BBQ, also.

We went for lunch. The lunch buffet plus a Coke was $13.00 after tax. If you just do the single serving and just water, it's less than $10 after tax.<//review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>So, I love this place. They aren't so fussy about the decor, or even the maintenance of their seating. But here's the kicker, it's self serve buffet style mongolian barbecue!

You could probably go to a more expensive place to see a cleaner decor, but if you're looking for a "hole in the wall" type of place in North Orange County, this is your place.

Also, this is the only Mongolian bbq where I've had lamb as one of the meats!

#tip

When you enter, they will point you to where you sit. After you sit, they'll take your order, basically, either you do: all you can eat or a single serving. The meals come with a drink, rice, bread pouch and soup (the soup is just a house soup and a hit or miss on thickness). It's a really good deal.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to in my life. If I could I would give it a negative 5.

I have been eating Mongolian BBQ for more than 20 years and this is a lousy representation of Mongolian BBQ. The food was awful, and that doesn't begin to describe it.

Let me say that this is the only place I have ever walked out on. We went thru the line prepared the food and the first bite made me gag it was so awful. I told the server and their response was too bad. So we walked out without paying (or eating) and the manager chased after us and yelled that it was in "Bad Taste to walk out  without paying". I yelled back that the bad taste was the food.</text>

<text>This is basicaly a self serve deal.I've been coming here with friends and family for over 17 years. People that have complained here just don't get it. The putz that walked out has no one to blame except himself. YOU but the food in the bowl and they cook it. The thing I love about this place is that they have way more veggies and sauces than any other. And the price. They are always refilling your drink of choice,(iced tea is great here), This started as a mom and pop shop and I believe it's thier kids running it now.Still good and great price. See the same ppl all the time. One of my favorite hole in the wall's.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Ewww. Lets just say it wont worth the time and money at all. Dried rice, greasy and dirty grill and the server girl didnt understand my question " how much was the lunch special?" and kept saying "no, no". For $11, you will be better off with any chinese carryout.<//Review>

Limited veggies......bad service. ....when you hand them your bowl of raw meat and veggies they dont use a fresh bowl to put the cooked food in,  they used the same bowl. Then I watched them do it to customers behind me. To lazy to wash the dishes or just looking to make people sick?< /Text>

Don’t go here, they cut my brothers hair and didn’t even cut it the way he wanted, also messed up and didn’t even fixed it, and also had the nerve to have him wait hours just to overcharge him too please don’t go here.<//Review>

I walked in on a Saturday morning on my scooter ride to the library and was able to grab an appointment for later. When I came back I only had to wait a little bit before Dorian helped me out! I got a water, a sick new haircut and a much needed beard trim!<//text>

The best men's haircut in the South Bay. For $22, you really cannot go wrong with this place. Although I always get my cut with Jose, I've seen the talent of most of the barbers here and it truly is exceptional. Great service, affordable, and good vibes.</text>

Great place for a solid haircut, Raphael is my guy but everyone there does amazing work. Artist in their own trade. I suggest calling ahead because the book up fairly quickly, but walk-ins are welcome and if you get stuck waiting is still worth it. Not just for the haircut but for the atmosphere.<//review>

<review>I showed up the first time with no appointment and Jose Q was able to attend me right away. The environment is very inviting with a Foosball table and beverages (all at no extra cost) to entertain us if there is a wait. Since then I've gone 2 more times with an appointment and I'm out of there in about 35 minutes or less. Jose makes me feel like a friend and makes me look like a BOSS! Check them out.< /review><Name>Jorge Jimenez<//Name>< user>

Disappointing online says they open at 9. On the door says they open from 9-6. When I got here at 10:40am everything was locked with "Open" sign posted up. So I called the number listed, guy answers and says "Stepped out to lunch, be back in an hour." It's not even 11 yet and you're out to lunch? You just opened! The man on the phone sounded high and asleep. If you're not open, remove the open signs and change your hours. Waste of time. Recommendations: adopt a professional attitude in regards to customer satisfaction. Change your hours if 9am is too early for you.< /Text>

First time there ,disappointing work and for the price is stupidity (22$), uneven sizing,fade is way off ,line up isn't even lined up ,may look good cause of the material things in there but dont be fooled. Never send a first timer(customer) to a rookie.
Never a second time to make a first impression.</text>

This place is great. Me and my family have been cutting our hair with dorian the owner for a long time. He recently opened this shop it has a car machanics theme it is awesome he has a couple of nice amenities to make you feel comfortable fooseball table, two tvs , music , video games etc.. Did I mention very nice barbers and great with kids so if your in the hawthorne area definitely get your hair cut here you will not be disappointed!</Text>

<text>One of my favorites in Camarillo. Its always clean. There's always new flavors. And its nice to swing by with my daughter after we eat something or even for a reward.

They're becoming cheap. Stingy on sample cups and no longer give free water which I'm pretty sure is illegal. Frozen yogurt is still delicious...< /review>

<review>VERY BAD SERVICE TWICE IN A ROW!!! . We went around late evening before closing - about 20min before closing and all the good flavors were empty. We asked to refill and the girl serving was very rood and said NO to us. Many toppings were empty, she even said no to water and said we came in late.  How can a place like yogurtland would have such a bad service. If you are not closed then you have to welcome your guest and provide a good service. We went twice and received same type of treatment. Almost all flavors were empty or coming out very liquify.  It was like they disliked us being there. I will never go there again!! And will never recommend this place to anyone!!   Very BAD service!!!< /review>< Pictures>

Just came out of yogurtland in Camarillo. I get strawberry yogurt whenever I find a yogurt store. The one in here tasted like medicine. Not even the slightest bit of strawberry flavor . When I told the girl that it was awful she asked did you taste it? I said where are the tasters? She said we have them and pulled out a container of cups from behind the counter. There are no signs to indicate that you can taste a flavor before you buy it. The young staff member didn't even know to say I'm sorry you didn't like it. Do they get any customer service training at all? I moved to Camarillo from Dublin Ireland 6 weeks ago. I won't be back.< /text>

Today at 03:07 pm to reward my kids as a treat for end of Spring Break You
Yogurt was bland in taste and many of the toppings like Nilla Wafers and cookie dough were stale tasting Was definitely not worth $27.67.When I notified manager in charge Melissa,also working was   and  Juan FI believe I wrote a note for the store manager to call and was not contacted.    therefore I will not be recommending!< /Text>

Great little mom and pop market. They are like a tiny version of Vallarta. I feel like the prices might be better here. Service is good, and it's always good to support your local businesses whenever possible. Will be shopping here from now on for my basic essentials.< /review>

< Review>
My boyfriend and I started going to the chiropractor because he was having back problems and my sciatic was flaring up during pregnancy.
We didn’t think we would continue going after I gave birth, but the staff at The Joint know us by name, they know about our lives, and especially know about our issues.
They make us feel like family, plus we always leave feeling better then when we came in.
They have a wide range of services, including working on pregnant women, which some other chiropractors don’t do. The Joint will also work on children, and my toddler keeps begging to try when she sees us getting adjusted.
We couldn’t be happier with the service or the staff at The Joint- Van Nuys!<//Review>

<text>I'll admit that I was always a bit skeptical of the chiropractic world. But, after dealing with chronic neck issues, I knew I needed to do something about it. After just three adjustments, it's amazing how much my upper back and neck tension has improved. A huge thank you to Dr. Sam for being so patient and kind. She is wonderful. Highly recommend!</text>< user_name>

< Review>
I love this place! It’s very convenient and affordable. I’ve never had a bad adjustment there, but I do prefer Dr. Bystrom’s technique. Not too rough. Not too gentle. He just gets the job done, and I usually feel really good afterward. Also, Crystal (apologies  if I misspelled) is the coolest front person ever. You guys should give her flowers or buy her a pony or something. But I digress.
Well, dear readers, I leave you with my sincerest recommendation. We all get out of whack sometimes; it’s nice to know that I can walk in at any time during the day and quickly get straightened out!</Review>

< Review>
In the van nuys office, the front desk woman is the sweetest! Truly makes you feel comfortable, I’ve met with 3 different chiropractors and wow! They are all great at their job, super friendly. As a personal trainer I also love that they detail what’s wrong and what’s causing the pain and how imbalanced one is. It’s an amazing price and honestly so worth it! Everyone needs to get aligned, because most people don’t realize their problems are actually rooted in other areas!
I came in with a leg 2 INCHES SHORTER! Causing severe pain up my shoulder and arm all the way down to my knee. In one session that pain subsided and every follow up appointment I’ve done only gets better and better 😍 Thank you! You are all awesome 💜</Review>

My boyfriend and I were referred to The Joint by my OB/GYN. I have been having back problems with my current pregnancy, and my boyfriend just slept wrong on the couch.
The Joint was able to get us in right away, the sign up process was simple, and the prices for service are unbeatable.
Open 7 days a week was a huge plus for us as well to be able to work around his work schedule and the needs of our children.
I was stoked to hear that they are willing to work with pregnant women and even more excited that my first adjustment seemed to cause great relief in a major problem area I was having.
Thanks so much for your service, we are both excited to start our treatment with the Joint!<//review>

I first took my son to get his back aligned due to his flat feet and it works great for him so I wanted some alignment as well because of my lower back pain. We always come out feeling flexible and loose. They do an awesome job.</text>

I highly recommend this place. I love their philosophy on spinal alignment & health. They have been helping me recover from injuries that I've been dealing with for 6 months. I've seen 5 different Doctors each time.  Everyone has been great. I would honestly say only one doctor was just a little too soft. But he was still good though.</Text>

<text>Doctors are bad, I got 5 adjustments and none of them felt any better at all, together with the fact that the "doctor" was taking my line of body symmetry off and adjusting without properly examining the spine. Some of the adjustments felt outright traumatic and I had a distinguishable feeling that the doctor does not have a confident idea in what he's doing and thats not something you want for your back. Overall they always just do the same exact thing to everyone regardless< /text></record>

<text>I’m very happy with the services provided by the doctors at this office - always friendly, professional, polite.
I’ve never experienced longer than 10 minutes wait here at walk-in even in the evenings.
Also I must say that I do feel much better after adjustments and notice the difference after a few weeks of coming here especially with my neck pain. And I do admire the affordable plans they offer for regular patients, so it doesn't cost a fortune.< /text>< rate>

<Review>I go see dr Gordon at the van nuys clinic once a week for the past two years and he is amazing! Very intuitive and effective with his adjustments. Encourages me that I know beat what my body needs and listens to feedback when I like a certain adjustment or can feel something works. I love that about him it makes me very comfortable! Dr bystrom is very sweet and nice also as well as the staff at the desk especially crystal! The 69 bucks a month I spend at the joint every month is the best 70 bucks a month I spend on wellness by far! So grateful to the joint in van nuys!<//Review>< time>

< Review>
I absolutely love Dr Gordon Kernes. I have had TMJ on my right side for 13 years. My jaw has popped, and only recently my left side has now started to mess up. I've had SEVERAL  chiropractors adjust my jaw. For the first time in 13 yrs, my jaw didn't pop. TMJ isn't cured in 1 adjustment, I know I'll have to come back regularly for a little while but I'm just happy I can now function without my jaw popping. He's the best!!!!!<//Review>

Dr. Bystrom has been helping me the past 3 days with issues I’ve had stemming from 3 years ago. He’s given me relief and identified areas on my back and shoulder that might be part of the problem. He’s also given me advice and techniques to work on when at home. He cares about what he does and wants to help you!</text>

Every single one of the Drs at the Joint has a unique way to address my problem but they are all experienced, wonderful, caring and they teach you how to listen to your body. They take your pain away.
Open every day, super flexible hours, no waiting, really affordable and effective.
You come to the office in pain and in 10 minutes, you leave feeling like a million dollars  and 15 years younger (only if you are over 40)<//review>

<text>My first time getting adjusted ever. I was pretty nervous and anxious. I let the chiro guy know that it was my first time. Who knew he would become one of my favorite people on this planet! Dr Luke walked me through all of what he did through out my first session, cracked a few jokes to make me less anxious and by the time I walked out of there I was a brand new person. My husband and I go there on Fridays or Saturdays only to see Dr Luke. We have gotten adjusted by other drs there but dr Luke is beyond amazing. He is sociable, funny, charismatic and so kind. I let him know what hurts and he tells me what he will adjust in order to minimize pain or treat the area until its fully gone. LOVE THAT GUY!!</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

The Joint Chiropractic has been such a blessing in my life since joining a few months ago. Dr. Bystrom and his staff at the Van Nuys location are so cordial and welcoming every time I check in. The chiropractors at the office are truly exceptional, and in a matter of a mere couple brief minutes, I am realigned and feeling totally refreshed to tackle my tasks for the remainder of the day. Having a primarily sedentary career in architecture and especially when playing in seasonal basketball leagues on the side, I really appreciate the relief from stiffness and release of tension that all my joints accumulate while running on the court, and have also noticed my balance increase and potential risks for injury—ankle in particular—have gone down thanks to all the adjustments and alignment of my spine and entire body. Invest in yourself and become a member of The Joint Chiropractic if you value quality care and longevity for your body, overall health, and life, at an affordable price!< /review>

UPDATED REVIEW:

Quality of their doctors have decreased drastically and they have trouble keeping the same doctor around for long. Wouldn’t recommend going here anymore.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

Great place and awesome concept for regular Chiro care... but right now there isn’t much consistency in the quality of their doctors...

currently I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Lee. He is amazing he know what is going on in your body as he feels around and instantly gets every join that needs work without fail....

Bad experiences: I had one doctor who was so bad he missed everything... he aligned my position well , and then right before the adjustment, he missed everything! I came out of there not knowing what I’d just paid for...  then there’s a Dr. John I think. He’s really nice and knows a lot.. he’s very good with your right side but misses everything on the left... so you walk out feeling completely unbalanced...

Amazing: Dr. Lee however is amazing... he won’t miss a thing and you walk out of there feeling so much better increased blood flow, no restriction in movement, my neck even turns better and smoothly and MORE!!!

HIGHLY RECOMMEND DR. Lee!

Really if it wasn’t for him I’d have cancelled my membership since I’ve tried three doctors there and they’re all inconsistent and not the best.<//Text>

This place was wonderful but today did not have a good experience the men that was working on me did not took the time to work the muscle to relax like they did before 5 minutes and I was out to top everything as im leaving the girl was just giving the paper that you fill out to point out where are my pains and stiffness what is the point of filling the paper if they don't even care. Usually at the end they tell you have come back or not nothing careless. Not happy at all</Text>

I’m so happy I discovered this place a few years ago.  I’m able to get regular chiropractic care at a decent price, and I like being able to drop in on my schedule.

I like the doctors and feel well-taken care of.  I do wish there wasn’t so
much turnover with the receptionists.  😕<//review>

<text>Dr Bystrom over at the joint in Van Nuys is an amazing chiropractor! I had really bad scoliosis when I first stared coming a year ago and with regular adjustments and exercise my spine is almost back to a normal looking spine and not an S. I no longer get migraines, my energy is back and I am over joyed with having little to no back pain.
Thank you!< /text>< response>

This place is fantastic. They are super accommodating and get everyone in and out very quickly. While quick and effective they also do a fantastic job and make you feel like the lost important client that have. Dr. Bystrom is the best, but the other rotating Dr.s they have do a great job as well.< /text>

<review>Let me first say, just coming in there i was given such an amazing energy from Regina. Very great energy that makes you feel very comfortable  and gave me great tips to help improve my diet as well. Always great having a nice chat with her before i start. The doctors are so amazing as well! Dr. Nguyen , probably the best doctor I’ve had. His adjustments are honestly what i feel are just perfect. He really goes in depth on what he’s doing and never fails to miss parts that i really need adjusted. He has humor too. That never hurts anybody haha.  The only down side would only be dr bystanders approach to some adjustments aren’t very well. But other than that i love this place !</review>< user_id>

McKayla at the front really helped me out getting back onto a wellness plan. She is very nice and caring about patients. Doctor Bystrom is also extremely professional and a great Chiropracter. Plus the joint is really affordable. You really can’t beat the service or price that they offer. Thanks a lot!</Text>

< Review>
LESS PAIN, EVERY DAY!!! From the fantastic customer service to the wonderful care, I couldn’t be happier with the Joint! I injured my neck last week, and couldn’t get a good nights sleep for a week. After my first appointment, it was a world of difference, and I’ve had a great nights rest since! They took the time to explain where my injury was coming from, and took the stress off my mind as well! And for the best rate I have ever seen, I have a phenomenal treatment plan, so I’m back to boxing and partying painlessly in no time! After my first neck injury, I was really concerned about finding a chiropractor that would work well with me. I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH THE JOINT!!! 🖤🏥🙏< /Review>

The doctors are very nice and one receptionist I found to be very welcoming and professional (short curly hair). The other two receptionists I delt with one was taking a personal and completely ignored me she eventually stepped outside without saying anything to me, I had come in with a new person who wanted to sign up and I felt it was very unprofessional. I went out back to ask a doc for paperwork because the receptionist was busy on the phone. The other receptionist wasn’t welcoming at all and her vive was just not a good one when I mentioned I wanted to cancel my membership. I’d want to sign up again but I’d definitely try some place else like Glendale or Hollywood.<//Text>

I have been going to The Joint for 2 years at least & have had nothing short of superb care.
The doctors there, Dr. Bystrom & Dr. Escobar to name a few are very attentive & in tune to ones aches & pains.
I am an avid surfer & snowboarder & always make it to point to get an adjustment before & after many of days with these activities.
I also suffer w/sciatica pain & with their care I am able to manage my body & have my body in tune for the rigors of the mountain & the ocean.
I can't say enough w/the care I receive.
I have seen many chiropractors in Los Angeles & The Joint provides great care at an unbeatable price,  a value if ever there was one.<//review>

I have mild Scoleosis or curvature of the spine, quite common, having gotten a walk-in, first-time patient special for an adjustment, I signed up for some sessions in bulk because of the dollar benefit saved here.  I've been going to The Joint at least every other day usually for $10 per sessioin due to my subscription plan, and not only is my chronic back pain which was at 99% pain, generally at 30% max now, I'm not a doctor but I'm trying to articulate the phenomenon here, it is as if my spine was pressing against my lung at an angle that limited my breathing and they fixed it: massive relief and better well being.  I've been to Dr. Bystrom, Dr. Wynn and Dr. Escobar at the Joint Chriporactic in Van Nuys, and each has a mildly different approach to adjusting and all three are very effective approaches.  I'm not saying to go to chiropractic to cure cancer, but otherwise this place is my saving grace.  Truly.<//text>

The doctors are nice, but don't sign up for the monthly service. We tried to cancel  the service and the girl at the front desk was very rude. I spoke to someone on the phone who said it was no problem to cancel,  so I don't know why the story changed when we talked to them in person.   We explained that our hours had been cut at work and we can't afford the service, but they insisted we pay for two more months.  Then she refused to let us even use the service that we're forced to pay for because she said we were being rude. I'm calling my bank and having them investigate this company.< /Review>

<text>I highly recommend Dr. Bystrom.  He relieved my back pain that I had been suffering from for several months due to heavy lifting at the gym.  It only took a few visits. His prices are very reasonable and he has a great bedside manner.<//text></record>

You guys always get me walking again. I have severe back issues and you keep track of every little detail, I appreciate that greatly considering my issues are constantly shifting around. I also like that you straighten out my hips which not many chiropractors have done with me, I notice the difference. Most of all The Joint is very affordable and it's now become a chain so I get work done on my back when I'm in the city too. P.S. I love the new Weho location! However I wish my Sherman Oaks location was open earlier! I have to wait 2-4 hours for you guys to open bc my back always gets me up early from pain. I get all of my errands done and find myself back at home in pain, sitting in the couch bc I'm waiting for you to guys to open. My regular doctor opens at 8am I wish you guys opened at 9am at least. I still love my Sherman Oaks location the most though.< /Review>

<text>The food was super yummy, no doubt about that, but where my rating is based off of is the customer service at this location. I ordered 2 sides, a corn dog, and one slider. It was Memorial Day (5/31/21) and I placed my order at 8:44pm. Wasn’t a busy day but I still waited 30minutes for the food to arrive. Also, when a server brought food out to a group who was already there before me, she started recommending someone else from that group a food item, took money from him, and in no time brought out whatever item she had recommended.. like if her only priority was that one guy… I understand the wait at a restaurant and I’m patient but what I don’t understand is the wait for such a small order. I mean, even the group who ordered AFTER me got their food first. On top of that, some items from my order were burnt! I’d definitely give this place another shot since from what I tasted it deserves another shot, but they’ve got to work on their customer service and the quality of the food they're serving.

*From the pictures: Although you can’t tell very well, the corn dog and the onion rings were really burnt and had a bitter taste to them. The really tiny slider was so yummy but $2.50 for that?! Yikes! And the cheese tots were also super yummy but they’re pretty cheap with the cheese:/<//text>< pics>

Ordered the bratwurst burrito, T-Mex Sausage with Southwestern tots and a cold 805. The food was delicious and I definitely ordered more than I could eat. The sausage was juicy, had great flavor, fresh toppings, soft bread and good sauce. Tater tots were so crunchy outside, tasty sauce and cheese. Burrito was hefty and filling with good flavor. Washed it all down with a cold 805. The staff was friendly and it was clean inside. Thankfully they had outside seating, cute lights across the top and a tv playing football. It's located along a strip of other shops and there's a pretty big parking lot in the back. They have a bunch other tasty options so will definitely be back.<//text>

I come here today 5/25/2021 and the young lady with the glasses, Tiffany helped me with my order and her customer service was absolutely amazing she recommended the chicken sandwich and even that was amazing to. Along with the respectful attitude and swiftness she had while taking my order. She has a lot of patience. 10/10 would totally recommend</text>

I got dog haus over in canoga park and it was amazing but I ordered from the northridge location today and was not impressed. There were STEMS in my beyond breakfast burrito so they clearly didn't separate the arugula leaves from the stems. The beyond meet was dry and burnt. The egg is over done and rubbery. It also wasn't put together very well. I'm not impressed. On top of all that it was significantly more expensive than in canoga park and not sure why.

<Text>I love hotdogs and my go to hotdog spot is usually Dirt Dog but it was a little out of my way so I stopped by here and I was not disappointed. Ordered Sooo Cali dog, Cowboy and one corndog and one sausage corndog. Wasn't a fan of the the sausage corndog but everything else was fire. Plan on trying everything on the menu at least once.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Northridge has everything including Doghaus with options for all including plant based "plant b" menu options... 100% vegetarian, but able to make vegan. The sweet potato fries are great. They don't specific dietary restrictions on their menus, sauces, etc but have great customer service for takeout or pickup.</review>< pics>

Got the cowboy and the soo cali. The cowboy was a good bacon wrapped dog and the soo cali was "refreshing". We also got the chilli cheese tots but it uses american cheese and not cheddar so very disappointed. But all in all good eats.< /review>

<review>Food was great but over priced. When you pay a high price for a burger you expect it to fill you up and this burger didn't do it. Tastes great but not feeling.But this is not why I'm leaving a two-star review. I'm in the service industry and customer service everything to me. I sat at the outdoor table and the little sign that reads dirty or clean was set on dirty. When the guy brought out my food I asked if he can clean the table before we eat. His reply was, oh I think it's clean they just forgot to slide the little door that reads clean. At that point he reached over and switched it to clean. With covid going around, everyone has the right to have a clean spot to eat. As an employee his response should have been, my apologies, let me clean your table for you. Regardless of what he thought, he should have cleaned my table so that my son and I can feel comfortable eating. Management please make sure your employees are accommodating your customers needs. As customers coming into your establishment we should be feeling safe but instead I had a very unpleasant visit.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>I really enjoy food from the Dog Haus but I’ve had food from this location multiple times and it’s not good. The fries and hash tastes like it’s cooked in old oil. See the photo of the bottom of the barrel hash browns we got. It wasn’t very good. I would suggest going to the Dog Haus on Tampa.< /text><userid>100605375474214264275< /userid><Response>{'time': 1616891762064, 'text': 'Hi Kenneth,\n\nThanks for sharing your review.

This restaurant is very nasty. As I was waiting for my order, I observed a Door Dash delivery driver pick up an order and with that order there was a drink that came with it. The Door Dash delivery driver was told that he had to fill the cup up with the drink that was listed on the order. The Door Dash delivery driver put his hands inside the cup and touched the inside of the lid. Then that delivery driver will be delivering to a customer. I don’t know why this restaurant allows the drivers to fill those cups up for customer with Covid-19 being a priority. Someone could get sick from that carelessness. This restaurant is not taking those precautions at all. Also too many homeless people hanging around this restaurant outside. I don’t recommend coming to this location. I will be reporting this all because I have video footage I recorded</Text>

I HAVE ATTENDED THIS PLACE FROM DAY 1, I HAVE A LOCAL OFFICE NEAR BY. OWNERS ARE BEUTIFUL PEOPLE.
WHEN THE OWNERS ARE THERE THE EMPLOYEES HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THINS LIKE THE HAPPY HOUR DISCOUNTS.

I ATTENDED TODAY 5/3/21 AS USUAL AND I DRINK THE 1ST LITER AT REGULAR PRICE THE 2ND IS ALWAYS AFTER 3PM THE CASHIER REFUSED TO GIVE ME THE DISCOUNT ON A LITER.

VERY DISAPOINTED AND LEFT..........< /review>

<review>I haven't been going out for food much since the shut down but I was REALLY craving a Dog Haus dog! 🤤 I was glad to see a familiar face, Noushin is always so friendly! Mohammad Ali rang me up and he was also very nice.

The food here is AMAZING! SO MANY unique and tasty dogs along with quite a few other mouth watering items.

I definitely recommend Dog Haus. *Tip: sign up for their app, it's easy to use to browse the menu and order thru, plus there are some REALLY great perks!

Pros:
• Delicious food! The frieburger is a MUST if you like eggs and fries in your burger. 🍔
• Fast service!
• Bomb happy hour deals!
• Extensive tap list that's filled with beer fr local breweries! 🍻
• Clean and maintaining Covid safety protocols!

Cons:
• Honestly, none! 🤷🏾‍♀️ I mean, I'd love it if the food was slightly less expensive, but I still find it to be well priced for the quality.</Text>< Time>

Waited 30 minutes for 2 breakfast burritos. When we finally got our order, the eggs in the burrito were raw. Not jist sunnyside up but absolutely raw egg whites and all. Took it back for a refund.
I was really looking forward to trying the breakfast burritos.Very disappointed!
They refunded me for the burritos but still charged me $6. for 2 very small drinks!
Horrible service, even worse food.</review>

I drive all the way from Buena Park, Orange County just for fried Oreos and Dui fries with chili. I stood in line for about 30/40 mins. I've also tried the corn in the cup which was pretty tasty. They have Pretty dope decor an old school music to listen to while you sit an eat.< /Review>

I haven't been going out for food much since the shut down but I was REALLY craving a Dog Haus dog! 🤤 I was glad to see a familiar face, Noushin is always so friendly! Mohammad Ali rang me up and he was also very nice.

The food here is AMAZING! SO MANY unique and tasty dogs along with quite a few other mouth watering items.

I definitely recommend Dog Haus. *Tip: sign up for their app, it's easy to use to browse the menu and order thru, plus there are some REALLY great perks!

The food is great! I had a cheeseburger and it wasn't ordinary at all. The Hawaiian bread gave it a nice flavor. My boyfriend had some hotdog and it was delicious! Tasty food. The place is cool too, although when we went for dinner, the music was too loud.< /Review>

<review>Got our food to go. Unfortunately when we arrived back at our complex, the food just fell off the bag and dropped on the dirty floor. Found out that the bag doesn't have enough glue to hold weight of food. Called them up and they couldn't issue a refund over the phone and that it had to be done in person. We were just hungry and wanted our food so they re-order our food and gave us new bag. They were aware of this issue and had a few other incidents, hopefully they'll get this fixed.

Rating is for the delicious dogs and service. The place has an industrial feel and always plenty of parking in the back.< /review><gmap_id>0x80c29bac50cf4285:0xef08fdf34f8d1ae4< /gmap_id><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLYrqJDoMAZ0wZqx4GFwD78oj_emFuWJHE8YNW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvfy5HYmobIOeqWWKr6by7dg1OojoL5H5SxN1E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1iX835TebJQdCbTJXp95jIfCBUvneuxZHhZIJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRnBpQSrbdRjmecLeOyTP3SBN4WVZNbkOsRZPT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgG15nmDTj_nU4-GpAEqk0CY1yjnimR_gl2SC7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXr6eeyAlvYvCFP0gwWfDe0nbkCYmfEfG9p_C5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< date>

<Text>DogHaus was awesome. They have so many options of hot dogs, links and burgers. The quality was excellent and the presentation of the food very nice. The groupon is def worth it, but without a groupon, the prices are still affordable. For vegetarians, they have a veggie dog and sides you could munch on. The portions are good, so you may not need to get a side with your hotdog or burger. Other than that, it was worth the visit, I drove from LA to Northridge. The restaurant felt like a fancy "millenial" wienerschiztel...idk if I spelled that right, but hope you got my drift. You can dine-in or take out. This is one of my fave new spots.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLQdGwndnGMQCMS56yTiJQKhvwekJ-pta0LGtg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPp02o9GZPoFCHRh3cQvBGbc21n10YPoMmj48fl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_0zGGbF1COJnhqWfUgcr24tFNncdF5KiJA0Pq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPC8RvTnSAQB51BkYCuSRag0-NzOqjTvgknMFtb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

Man, it's hard to find a good hot dog spot, especially when you're vegetarian, but Dirt Dog is that spot! With its loudly played, yet not overbearing, music and upbeat and friendly staff, the all around experience is great, not to mention the fact that they actually have good veggie options! It's a must try!< /Review>

It's great to hear you enjoyed that Veggie Dog, but we can't take credit for food items we don't serve and experiences we didn't create.\n\nBecause we want the restaurant you enjoyed to get the review they deserve, we suggest you remove your review from Dog Haus Northridge's Google page and post it to the Google page associated with business where you dined.\n\nWe hope you'll visit Dog Haus Northridge and try The Absolute Würst in the future, and we look forward to hearing about your experience.\n\nBest,"}<//response>< pictures>

This used to be my all time favorite halal burger place, but I recently found out that the bacon is pork, and it comes in a lot of menu options such as their burgers and hotdogs. I thought it would be halal turkey bacon because the store claims to have “100% guarantee of no cross contamination between beef and pork” But if they put pork bacon in the items themselves how can that be true? It’s common sense. I had to throw away an entire burger and honestly I lost the trust I had in them.</Review>

Great food lots to try. Lots of options and choices. Vegan veggie chicken chilli.
Staff friendly and helpful personable.
"The hype is real"   the parking however is horrible... Got there about 30min before the 12 lunch rush and drove in circles for about 20mins. Its crammed and crazy. But I would go back for the food. I would love to go try something different each time.  Great job Dirt Dogs<//Text>

My food was somehow overdone on the outside and underdone on the insides, and besides all that it wasn't great.  Plus it took a long time to be served compared to everyone else at my table.  With everyone wearing masks and the volume inside the place it was hard to communicate properly, but I was straight up ignored by what appeared to be a senior staff person who was too busy doing whatever to look up.<//text>

We hope that despite this, you’ll try Dog Haus another time.\n\nWe’re proud of our food, and we source the best possible ingredients to make it, such as 100% genetically tested Black Angus beef from Creekstone Farms that is certified humanely raised, vegetarian fed and free of all hormones and antibiotics. We also serve vegetarian fed poultry and Premium Iowa Pork, both of which are hormone- and antibiotic-free. Our mission to serve the highest quality food includes nitrate-free sausages and hot dogs that are free of all added nitrates and nitrites. What’s more, all of our dogs and sausages are made exclusively for Dog Haus by our Würstmacher, Adam Gertler, using proprietary recipes.\n\nOur items may cost a bit more than those you can get a fast food restaurant, big box retailer, street vendor, or convenience store, but those type of businesses don’t offer the proprietary recipe dogs and sausages, signature flavor profiles, high quality ingredients, made to order items or dining experience as Dog Haus.\n\nWe’d like to better understand this situation. Would you please fill out our Google form, so we can take appropriate action? Thanks in advance.\n\nForm link:\nhttps://forms.gle/qGUqzmcXWD3yrb599\n\nBest,\nThe Dog Haus Team'}<//Response>

After eating average to below average food you forget how good a well made burger or hot dog can taste, stop in here for a reminder . highly recommend the chick sandwich and the chilli cheese dog.<//review>

As a vegetarian who didn’t give up meat because I didn’t like it, I’m always thrilled to be treated like a “full citizen” at meat-centric restaurants, and I got that treatment here at The Dog Haus (Northridge, CA location) where they have a veggie hot dog, a veggie sausage, and a veggie burger all available to go on any of their menu items.

It’s an order at the counter, small-ish establishment with craft beers on top and a family friendly / bar environment.

I was glad I could order anything off the menu and specify the vegetarian protein I wanted in it, though I rolled-my own with the the vegan apple sage sausage with mustard, onions and sauerkraut and cheddar cheese. This was super yummy. The flavor and texture of the veggie sausage was spot-on…the bun was perfect and I would definitely eat this again!

I also had tots on the side…these were perfectly cooked, not over done, not underdone…just the right amount of crispy on the outside with the inside being as tender as it should be.

Pair that with the stout on draft beer and I felt like a full fledged human being eating at a meat restaurant despite my vegetarianism. It was all super-yummy!

My son had a veggie hot dog with ketchup. He didn’t love it but I think it’s because there was too much ketchup on it, but in my eyes the veggie dog itself on his sandwich looked pretty good, and large (unlike the small veggie dogs you see in packages in the market.)

Since I was dining in, I wish the beer had come in a real glass, even a reusable plastic stein instead of a throw away plastic cup. I saw someone drinking from a large stein and think if people are dining in they should automatically serve in reusable glasses instead of throw-awayables (or at least ask what you want there...better for the environment and "nices up" the experience a bit to not be drinking out of a plastic cup,  but other than that I loved the meal there. The service was super-friendly and fast and I will definitely be back again!<//review>

What a place to go for amazing food. Not only is this place professional with amazing staff, but also has high quality in the food that they offer the customers. The Hangover burger is the way to go honestly. Their meat is so fresh and i really appreciated the atmosphere every time that I go. I would recommend going with family, friends, or just to grad a quick bite.</Review>

Great tasting food, but a bit over priced IMO. Ordered online for pick up and tracker said almost 40 mins to pick up, I showed up like 10 mins early to find my food was ready. Even though the tracker said still being prepared, I got my food and it wasn't warm anymore. They need to update the tracker to show customers the real time status. Plenty of parking in the rear of establishment or on street in front.< /review>

Yeah it's a local chain, but it's a good one. This version has beer, ample parking, outdoor seating, and access to the Dodgers channel. Dogs, burgers and sides are all good with lots of interesting toppings, and they have beyond beef sausages and impossible burger patties for the non-meat eaters. Friendly staff. Portion sizes are reasonable so over-order if you eat a lot.< /review>

DogHaus was awesome. They have so many options of hot dogs, links and burgers. The quality was excellent and the presentation of the food very nice. The groupon is def worth it, but without a groupon, the prices are still affordable. For vegetarians, they have a veggie dog and sides you could munch on. The portions are good, so you may not need to get a side with your hotdog or burger. Other than that, it was worth the visit, I drove from LA to Northridge. The restaurant felt like a fancy "millenial" wienerschiztel...idk if I spelled that right, but hope you got my drift. You can dine-in or take out. This is one of my fave new spots.< /Text>

The food wasn't fresh. I asked for fresh taters and was told that they're made in batches every 30 minutes and he refused to make me fresh taters. (And the beer was flatt) Because of that I only go to the BURBANK location. Just seems like there more experienced and have a better crew there.

Have been here a few more times since then and outside of the taters everything else is bomb !!! 💯< /Text>

<review>I came here by accident haha. While my bf and I were at the Popeye's drive through I notice Dirt Dog and decided to call in for pickup. Went in to pick up the food and the lady which I guess the owner said that they dont do phone order on the weekend but lucky me  they made the food anyway woohoo. So glad I got a chance to taste the flaming corn and the house dog - amazing! Will come back again for sure.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1596652906783, 'text': "Hey Marcel,\n\nThanks for posting that 4-star review.

Soooooooo goood! We went here randomly because we were craving street dogs... OMG the best!!! We got the elote dog, the flamin dog and the house dog with asada fries and everything was great! The fries needed a little bit of seasoning and I was not a huge fan of it but everything else was amazing! Since I went for the hotdogs and fries was just a bonus I'll keep it at 5 stars!<//Text>

The best Hot Dogs in the Valley. I'm not normally a hot dog person, but after coming here I can't help but want more! And a big plus, they have garlic fries. :) Sigh. I can't wait to go back.<//Review>

The staff here is super friendly & helpful. After two recent experiences at this spot, I am eager to return again in the near future. The delicious novelty of putting everything (burgers & dogs) on King's Hawaiian Rolls was an unexpected delight! They have a nice selection of beers too. I still want to try the tater tots with chili & cheese on top.</Review>

The food is good but the service is slow. I think the problem is that staffing lacks. For example: One person managing the phones and taking orders at the counter is just not a good situation with a line of 4+ people, particularly when they are clearly dealing with a GrubHub customer. Another time they obviously screwed up an order by scraping off the sauce, but thankfully it was replaced.

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I had the cowboy hot dog, the cheese fries, and the chocolate shake, all of which were really great. The dogs are great, bacon wrapped, and served on a Hawaiian roll bun. The fries are good and not soggy. The shake was tasty.
Highly recommend. They seem to have a happy hour for alcohol as well.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

WARNING LONG READ! I had a bad experience about a month or so ago. Last night I went back by myself, to the same DogHaus, ordered my food and waited for takeout. I purchased a Groupon voucher the day of my bad experience, and didn't use it. My niece, who's recently paralyzed in L.A. told me she wanted to see me, and to bring something new and different from the valley. I thought to myself she might like the Dog Haus. I ordered the Mensch, spicy chicken, and  cheesy taters. Due,to me using a voucher you must dine in. The young man explain to me the dilemma, but he honored me a one-time courtesy. I didn't have to explain anything to him,  he was extremely generous and courteous. It was late and I was not looking forward to the ride to L.A..  While waiting, I had a chance to watch the young lady at the register, she was very welcoming to all who approached her, and very patient. She also acknowledged other customers as they were walking in to dine. While I was there  the line became very long, but everyone was pleasant. This gave me a sense that they too know that love, and comfort food is being served in this establishment. When my food was delivered to me the gentlemen informed me, that he had given me a 10% discount on my next order. I thought that was nice. I'm  so glad that I'm  a person of second chances. I experienced an easy flow ordering, food cooked to order, and a goody with delivered. All this to say that the drive to LA was not what I  wanted, but my niece eating those cheesy taters w/ ketchup was priceless. She loved them more than she loved the Spicy Chicken. She ate the sandwich and we got to stay up til 4am, talking about the last 2 months of 2020. Thanks Dog Haus, I don't drink beer, but I will be bringing my folks whenever they come to the valley to  visit.< /Review>

Great experience!  Starting from the ambience, followed by the amazingly friendly staff and ending with organic delicious fast food. You gotta try the fried egg on your burger! Out of this world! The vegetarian options for the sausage and burger are small but the quality and taste makes up for it!

We also had the pleasure in meeting one of the owners as well as his younger brother. The owner is in this business with his heart and soul. You can see and feel it. You gotta try it! You will not regret it!<//text>

We love this place! We have been coming here once a week for years and it's a family favorite. We've tried most items on their menu and I can confidently say that they've got some of the best burgers, fries, and hot dogs I've ever had anywhere in Los Angeles or elsewhere for that matter. You must check it out if you're in the area. The quality of their food is amazing. The service is excellent and they really take pride in the food they serve. It's a completely fabulous experience you're sure to enjoy!< /Text>

.79 for side of ranch dressing! At least full the cup to the top. Cheap place charging so much and skimping on the dressing. Noticed service and quality gets worse over time. Not long till they close and something better opens up. Upon reading others review the owner/manager couldn't care less by only responding with a cheesy lame copy paste response. I expect no different.</review>

Amazing service from Farbod. He treated my kids very well, gave them some cookies for free to please them. At the end, my daughter wanted to pay for and extra cheese on the fries, and he didnt want to charge it. Super friendly and polite. The food is great, and the amazing service just make us want to come back more.</Text>

The food was good but let me tell you about the service.
The last time I went there I had just had spine surgery and I felt awful.  It must have been apparent from the  way i looked and the neck brace I was wearing.  I was the only person in line and I could not get waited on.  The manager and staff were arguing  about someone's beer bill and how to charge them.  I think it must have been obvious that I could barely stand but stand I did.  When I finally  ordered my food I was thinking the  bill seemed kind of high.  When I looked at my receipt I realized they charged me  for the two beers for the other customer.  I ordered a shake for my meal and it arrived when I was leaving.  They did take the two beers off the bill though.  I emailed  the company about the poor service and got no response.  They are  probably  ticked off that I didn't pay  for the two beers.</Text>

Very good hamburgers and dogs. I love the fact that the buns are from Hawaiian rolls. I got the downtown dog, which was very good.  I also got the hangover haus burger, which was amazing, and the egg was the best part. They sell pints and liters of beer. Nice spot. A must try if in the area.<//Text>

I walked in for a burger and did not regret it. The food was great and the milkshake was amazing! I would like to thank farbod for his awesome customer service, he  was very attentive and helpful with the food selection. I would overall recommend this place for its food and polite customer service.<//review>

Cute decor inside and out. Friendly and helpful staff. From the conversations, lots of return customers. We ate the chicken sandwich but that is not what they are known for so not fair to comment except that it was ok and a choice for non beef eaters. Would be nice if fries were included with the meals.<//Review>

The food is good.  How ever the burgers are way too messy.  Falls apart after 3 bites but I guess that's how it's supposed to be. 🧐  not too crowded. Good burgers fair priced.< /Text>

The food wasn't fresh. I asked for fresh taters and was told that they're made in batches every 30 minutes and he refused to make me fresh taters. (And the beer was flatt) Because of that I only go to the BURBANK location. Just seems like there more experienced and have a better crew there.

Have been here a few more times since then and outside of the taters everything else is bomb !!! 💯</text>

I know getting bacon with a sustainable plant based vegan burger is blasphemous, but it's bacon.

They use Hawaiian rolls as buns so you can pull off a piece and share but you probably wont want to because this is one of the most delicious burgers out there.<//review>< pics>

<user_name>Cory<//user_name><resp>None<//resp><Review>This place wasn't all that great. The atmosphere was more of a college hangout, the food wasn't anything special and it was overpriced. Two of the three burgers ordered were prepared improperly and had to be remade. The worker informed of this mistake wasn't very pleasant about it. She informed the cook whom in turn looked back at us with a disgusted look, making it a little uncomfortable. It wasn't till we talked to the shift manager that the problem was resolved properly. She refunded our party for the bad experience and comped our next visit. She is the only reason I decided to give this place three stars. Despite the generosity of refund and comp, this establishment will not receive my business. I wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone I know.<//Review>< Pics>

Food was great, ambience was nice, the place looks small but it's actually pretty big. They have nice craft beers, and canned if preferred. The place is clean and we got our food pretty quick. I'm returning very soon<//text>

A newer Dog Haus location. Good food, service and beer selection. I had the cowboy which was well prepared and had a great smoky flavor. Be aware all there food seems to have a tendency to come apart if you aren't careful. Decor is clean and they have a above average amount of seating both inside and out. Plenty of parking in rear. I'll definitely be back.< /text>

This rating is fake.
No way do they deserve over 4 stars.
I'd give zero(0) stars if available.
I give it the lowest rating possible based on service. Plus, horrible delivery service.
Beware! Sodium Nitrate.</review>

<rating>4</rating><text>Excellent burgers and sides.  This is NOT your typical fast food.  It's a premium  burger or dog.  Those complaining about "overpriced" need to understand this.

The burgers are generous.  You taste REAL beef, not "breaded" by product.  I've had both the onion rings and tots.  The rings are excellent and the tots are not greasy.  The service has been friendly each time I've gone.  I look forward to returning.  I appreciate the classic rock music and overall atmosphere.  The servers are attentive and the food orders are quick, especially when burgers are made to order.

If you love burgers, Dog  Haus is a must.< /text>< pics>

I am post this review to help people with dietary restrictions.

I'm celiac and before I ordered food from them I called the store to make sure my impossible burger would be 100% vegan and gluten-free. I was assured by their chef and manager that I was safe. Minutes after finishing the burger I noticed my usual reaction and started digging around the internet to find out that they don't have gluten-free buns, much less gluten-free and vegan buns.< /Review>

Hot dog and bun are great. Chili and sauerkraut are such small portions. Save your money. Stick with just the hot dog. Expensive for what you get.< /Review>

I was literally violently I'll with food poisoning. I tried whatever there equivalent is to the western burger and not even fourty min later I was throwing up in my car on the drive home. Seemed great at the time and I liked the Hawaiian sweet roll buns looking back.i bet it was the ranch it did seem weird but I've never had food poisoning before and had no idea what i was in for I really thought I was going to die< /text>

Good variety of beer on tap. Interesting selection of food. Problem for me is that I'm not a fan of sweet Hawaiian bread which they use for buns. This food is savory to me and doesn't go well with sweet bread.< /text>

Great assortment of hot dogs and beer. Sides are also a wide variety. The choices to add on the hot dogs are so many that it's hard to make choices! Highly recommend.< /Text>

<time>1550680497058< /time><rate>3< /rate><Text>I used to really like this place, but the time before last I tried to order my usual and they had changed their plant-based sausage. I hadn't tried the Beyond Sausage before, but I figured I'd give it a go. After ordering and waiting nearly 30 minutes for 2 hot dogs to go, I noticed on my receipt it just said 'bratwurst' so I asked the cashier who rung me up if that was for the Beyond Bratwurst I ordered and he said "yeah, bratwurst" and I asked again "BEYOND bratwurst?" And he looked so confused and just shrugged and said "bratwurst" again. At this point the owner of this location comes over. Let me also add that on their menu, it is literally labelled as "Beyond Bratwurst" if you don't even know the name of something on the menu right behind you, I have no idea how to help you understand. The owner at this point understands what I am saying and begins to make excuses for her employee saying that the menu is new and they haven't gotten used to it. Then she tells me that it'll take another 30 minutes because the vegan meats are kept frozen, but if I want I can just have the regular bratwurst because it's almost done. She says this implying that it is my fault it'll take longer by being vegan when in reality if her employee had just listened to me it would've been finished at that point. I was clearly upset still so she offered to give me a refund. I paid with the mobile app because I forgot my wallet at home and she said there was nothing she could do to refund me since I used the app. I understand that's not her fault, but if she's the owner she should've been able to figure out another way to refund me. She eventually gave me two coupons for free items which didn't really help me because it was only for that location which is the furthest location from me AND it meant I needed to go back there which I didn't plan on doing. So I finally got my vegan bratwurst, ran late to pick up my boyfriend, and then got to try the Beyond sausage for the first time. 2 bites in, I couldn't stomach it and threw it away. So much for all that waiting and my free menu item coupons. I loved the Field Roast they used to have there and while I'm glad they've made a huge step in having an entire Plant Based vegan menu with Impossible Burgers and Sliders and 2 types of Beyond Sausage, it tastes too much like meat for me and it doesn't sit well in my stomach. I literally gave up meat because I didn't like the taste so it's great if you still like the taste, I just don't. I did go back to try it again when the circumstances weren't bad and I used those coupons (about a month later), and this time I did finish the hot dog, but it was more because I was hungry and it didn't make me sick that time even though I still didn't care for the taste. If you like the new vegan Beyond and Impossible, you'll probably like Dog Haus, but this location is now one I won't go to again.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Very unique and very tasty hot dogs and hamburgers with the Hawaiian rules instead but of your usual buns.
I've gone to the dog haus in Noho,but stopped by the one on Northridge and everyone was very friendly. Tater tots are to die for very crispy. You need to try the downtown dog that's my favorite. Will be going back.<//text>

<text>Located inside an old IHOP on the Western side of Reseda Blvd.  Very large parking lot located in the rear.  Small entry to the lot from Reseda that's easy to miss driving by. Much easier entry from Baird.  Menu consists of hot dogs, sausages, burgers, and sides.  Handful of beers on tap (pint, liter, or pitcher).  Burgers are well made and flavorful. Buns are King's Hawaiian Rolls (4-per burger), whichs sounds odd but works pretty well.  Utensils are located near the soft-drink machine you pass by on the way in.  Variety of tables and bar seating, with some available outdoors.  Service is decent.  Prices are on the high side, but not ridiculous and generally worth it.</text>< pics>

I enjoyed the Holy Aioli Burger, which is one of my favorites. My husband enjoyed another fav, the Mench, which has plenty of pastrami on it. We also shared a side of well done tots. We called in the order and it was done within 5 minutes of my arrival. There's a nice bar top that I briefly waited at. If you live in the area, Dog Haus sends frequent coupons...BOGO burgers etc. Also, I received an additional 10% cash back through Yelp 🤑 My only complaint would be the fact that the Reseda street entrance is not accessible for entry/exiting, which is a safety issue given that there's only one other public exit.<//Text>

Love the Dog Haus. Usually visit the Woodland Hills location, but no drop off in the fare at Northridge. They've done a good job repurposing an old I HOPE.<//review>

<text>Sorry guys the food was awful!  Tasted greasy and frying oil was awful and made tater tots taste weird.  Sliders were not good.  We had burger, beef dog and corn dog sliders.  One bite of each was the extent of what we could eat cause one more distasteful than the other.  Hawaiian bread didn't make up for less than awful taste.  Only good thing was manager refunded for the sliders...not the tater tots I just realized from my refund check.  However, not a good experience and will never return.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

The food is good and messy. My hubby had to eat his pastrami sandwich with a fork. The beer was really good too. They have a groupon, so save a little money before you go.</Text>

<Review>Delicious gourmet hotdogs, sausages and burgers. Just enjoyed my first visit here. The mule burger was amazing, and very very messy. The Thai currywurst sliced sausage had great flavor and was spicy enough to make me feel alive.

Def recommend this place as a quick savory bite to eat. Cool atmosphere and decent prices too.

Pictured Thai Currywurst. Mule was so good and so messy I couldn't put it down.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c29bac50cf4285:0xef08fdf34f8d1ae4<//gmap_id><user_name>Mike Gaboury</user_name>< Date>

<text>Dog Haus has become my go to place for hotdogs. I just love how their hotdogs taste with their Hawaiian bread buns.

You can customize your hotdog with the many different toppings they have or you can just order one of their specialty hotdogs. My favorite is the downtown dog and fries with bacon and egg on top. It's so good!

If hotdogs is not your thing, they also have burgers and sliders that you can order.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

{'time': 1563398784936, 'text': 'Hey Kenneth,\n\nOur items may cost a bit more than those you can get a fast food restaurant, big box retailer, street vendor, or convenience store, but those type of businesses don’t offer the proprietary recipe dogs and sausages, signature flavor profiles, high quality ingredients, made to order items or dining experience as Dog Haus.\n\nWe’re proud of our food, and we source the best possible ingredients to make it, such as 100% genetically tested Black Angus beef from Creekstone Farms that is certified humanely raised, vegetarian fed and free of all hormones and antibiotics. We also serve vegetarian fed poultry and Premium Iowa Pork, both of which are hormone- and antibiotic-free. Our mission to serve the highest quality food includes nitrate-free sausages and hot dogs that are free of all added nitrates and nitrites. What’s more, all of our dogs and sausages are made exclusively for Dog Haus by our Würstmacher, Adam Gertler, using proprietary recipes.'}< /response>
