I have had a wonderful experience so far at The Performance Lab! I train with Justin and he has been an amazing trainer so far. He is super helpful and always corrects us and fixes our form when needed. Every staff member is always incredibly friendly and always give off great customer service. I started out with no experience and not once have I felt judged from anyone working or working out there. The gym itself gives off a very welcoming feeling and I highly recommend it to anyone! Brett is running a great business with an awesome team!</Review>

<text>Great place to workout and great environment. Everyone on staff including the owner is helpful and friendly and does a great job to motivate you to reach your own goals not only in fitness but in life as well! Even after moving away I still receive calls and messages on how I’m doing, you don’t get that from anywhere else. Definitely a place I always recommend to friends and family!<//text>< Pics>

<Name>Maria Sandoval</Name><Time>1622092062340< /Time><rating>5< /rating><review>This gym has completely changed my life. There is no gym out there that compares to this one. You pay a monthly fee and can attend any of the group training classes. I personally attend the bakery class which is an all women's training class. The class is so WONDERFUL! You get the quality and challenge of personal training at a more affordable price. All the trainers are so supportive and always walking around to check your form. They always pay extra attention to new comers and are always around if you have a question on an certain exercise. Another great thing is that we always sanitize all equipment after use. This makes me feel a lot better during these times.  Please please give this gym a try, you will not regret it  I promise.< /review>< pics>

I do personal/small group training with Justin. He is awesome! He is very flexible with scheduling! He listens to your goals and builds workouts based on those goals. He pushes his clients to do their best but also offers modified exercises for clients with less experience, injuries, etc. I don’t personally know the other trainers but they seem nice enough. The employees at the front desk are nice and helpful as well!</Review>

I have been at this gym for 10 months. It’s the best decision I have ever made. Everyone is knowledgeable and motivating. Staff is friendly and helpful. A lot of my family members have tried a free class, they loved it, and are members now. It’s an hour of non-stop, fun and challenging workouts, which will give you results. I look forward to 7:00 pm.</Text>

<Review>There’s no gym in the 209 area like The Performance Lab! I travel from Stockton to catch the morning workouts before work and I’m left with enough energy to carry out my day. The workouts are only an hour yet intense, not a muscle goes untouched. With their combined knowledge through school and life experience through athletics, it can’t get any better. Also, there is a large focus on the youth, understanding that there is a lack of positivity and guidance in our communities. They’re working on offering counseling!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>More than just a gym. TPL is a second home that I get to go to everyday to work on myself and meet new people! The training is amazing and I have reached levels of strength I never thought I could. Whether it’s group classes or personal training, the experience is amazing! An inclusive environment that also pushes you out of your comfort zone. Love<//review><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808566c33afbea79:0x40184b9d8eed6ca5< /gmapID></record>

I love this gym! I’ve been going for 3 years now and have never been pushed to be a better version of myself more than here. Brett, the owner, is the most kind hearted and hard working man I have ever met. Not only do the trainers encourage and push you inside the gym, but outside as well! If you want a bomb workout that will kick your butt you know where to go!< /review>

Had an amazing experience training with Vee! No matter what level you are at she is willing to work with you. Her workouts are intense but she is so motivating, stick with it and you will definitely see results! Overall the energy in the gym is positive and non-judgmental which I also loved about working out here.</Text>

I have been taking classes at TPL for about 8 months now and it’s an amazing facility. The trainers are extremely helpful and encouraging. They will teach you if you are unsure of something and they push you to be better every time you train. They have created a wonderful atmosphere for their clients.<//Text>

Hello this is Briana I have been training a little over a year now at TPL. I was introduced by my older brother who use to attend this place. Let me just tell you the day I walked into this place it was a life changing experience. Not only is this place amazing it is filled with amazing people who push you to reach your goals. I never would of imagine pushing myself as much as I do in this gym. Victor who is my currently training me is an amazing trainer and  will train you to become the best version of yourself whether it’s mentally or physically. This place has changed my life I am so thankful to be a part of this family! Best place in town to be a part of🙌🏻 Thankful Brett didn’t give up on his goals and had the ambition to make this dream a reality 👏<//Text>

<text>For awhile I was feeling insecure about my body and my weight and was recommended TPL ever since I been coming here even though it’s a short time and I took a break from a family emergency for 1 week I can’t wait to go back and work on my personal goals again! It’s such a great community and Brett (my trainer) is such a wonderful person he works with you and is extremely understanding. I’m really glad I got the chance to work out and train with one of the best in the Valley!!!!!< /text>< pics>

I've definitely fallen in love with this gym. I've never had a trainer push me to a point I never knew I could reach. I love that they come around and help you.....to make sure you are completing the exercises correctly. I find myself working harder than I've ever worked before and I've been a member at other gyms before. Every staff member I've had an encounter with has been nothing but professional. I recently started personal training with Veronica and so far....all I have to say is that I have no regrets being a member at this gym.<//Review>

Started the gym this year in March for their March Madness! It was definitely more that I ever expected it to be! The trainers are nice, friendly and very helpful! The encouragement you get at this gym is something you dont get at a regular fitness facility. I look forward to coming to my scheduled sessions every week! Trainers are very supportive and help you even out of the gym with meals and workouts!</review>

<Review>Hands down one of the best gyms I have been to. Being in the military I know what it is like to be held accountable and pushed to be better, and that is what this gym wants for you every time you step threw those doors. If you want TRUE results from great people that really love what they do, this is the gym for you.</Review>< user>

Been going here for over 5 years. My 3 kids all go here ages 22,21,&18.  This is my other family. Everyone here always greet me when I come in. Best workouts hands down. I started doing workouts I never thought I could do. They have been one of my biggest supporters. When I thought I couldn’t do it they showed me I could. I’ve struggled with my weight my entire life and I have been scared to go to a gym. I’m so grateful for this gym!<//Text>

I’ve been coming to this place of and on for years. I’ve seen the evolution of TPL from what it was to what it is now. The only way you can grow as a company is if your doing something right. Clearly they are here. The workouts are intense mixed in with some fun. From the classes, challenges, to the personal training you leave with a shirt full of sweat. The support you get from the trainer and even the clients is by far the best feeling. Everyone has the same goals. Definitely a gym to try out if your in the area just be ready to work. I’ve tried other gyms before and they just didn’t do it for me.< /review>

I've been going here for nearly 5 years. All the trainers are there to make sure you get to your goals, whether that be weight loss, muscle gain, or both. The equipment is top notch, the music is great, and each time you get a full body workout that will always leave your shirt drenched in sweat. I train with Victor and he is very nice, always there to push you that little extra bit and always makes our workouts fun with his personality. They are very accommodating with physical limits or injuries. I had multiple knee surgeries and they were always happy to modify something or let me do something else if my knee wouldn't allow me to do the exercise. I couldn't recommend this place enough for its nonjudgemental atmosphere, fun attitude and an all around good workout.</review>

I love this place. The bakery is amazing. I really like that there are so many women there that are all different ages and levels. They are great at giving modifications if needed. Veronica is my go to trainer but there are so many others there that are also very motivational. I also go to the regular TPL classes with my kids. I love the bonding time with them and it pushes them to be better athletes. Keep doing what you all are doing TPL Team we love it!<//Text>

I have had the pleasure of being both a member and an employee at TPL and in each role I have enjoyed my time tremendously. I started my fitness journey in my 40's after attending my first TPL class I was instantly hooked. All the trainers past and present have been a positive reinforcement in my journey. They genuinely care about the health and well being of their members and consistently go above and beyond to help you achieve your goals. The workouts are like no other, the members are inspiring and motivating and the trainers are the best in the industry. You will not do the same workout twice so you'll never get bored and this is coming from a 7+ year member. Becoming a member was the best decision I ever made. It's a life changing gym experience. Brett and his team have become family and the more they grow the better they get from helping the community and Veronica uplifting the women in her all female class by building a solid foundation for female uplifting and empowerment. No other gym compares to the high caliber of training, friendliness and encouragement you will receive. I highly recommend this gym to anyone looking to push the limits and boundaries of their body and mind.</Text>

<Text>I have been with TPL for a few years now. TPL has been good to me and to my sons. They are supportive and caring coaches. I have been very happy there. I have never had any issues as it's a place you get in and out. It's a drama free environment. I highly recommend this gym as Veronica, Brett, and Victor are always there to provide support.</Text>< Pics>

This Gym is definitely one of a kind! The staff is amazing. I love the structure behind every workout. They make me look forward to working out. The trainers are so helpful and will push you every session. Vee is amazing always pushing me in my workouts. You can tell she truly cares about her clients. My daughter attended the kids class and Victor was awesome with her, all of the staff is very good with kids. The owner Brett has always been friendly and happy to answer any questions I may of had. TPL will always have our support! Keep up the good work.< /Text>

Came in here not even able to lift a bar, knowing little to NOTHING about working out, every single trainer makes an effort to make you feel welcome here and make each class personable! You can tell everybody genuinely cares about each other.
Also I never knew what “sore” meant before coming here LOL.
Thank you forever TPL. 🖤<//review>

I have had the opportunity to train in many facilities across the US due to my 26+ year military career. TPL is truly doing a great job to build up its base in a healthy and fun environment.  Continue to grow the TPL System.< /Review>

Every time I walk into this gym, I know I’m working towards being the best version of myself. The staff is very supportive and push you to challenge yourself. In the past I’ve done personals with Vee and Victor and they’re both amazing! I see other trainers with their clients as well and they’re all very knowledgeable and passionate. 11/10 recommend going to TPL. You don’t need any experience to start your journey.

The best of the best! Brett and TPL team, keep doing what you’re doing</Text>

One of the things I’ve taken in about this place, is that they mean BUSINESS. I love the environment and the professionalism with the trainers.I’m just starting but have been coming in to help with my sis in her training and it’s been great to watch. It was so great that it pushed me to eventually join. AND I LOVE IT! I’ve met a couple of the other trainers in passing and so far they’ve all been really cool and supportive. You definitely do not want to go in there if you’re looking for short term results. TPL is about longevity and pushing you to being greater than you ever thought to be. Grateful for this opportunity to work with Brett and the TPL fam.< /Review>

hands down the BEST GYM EVER!! you will be surrounded with support, motivating individuals of all ages, good energy, and uplifting trainers who are there to help you reach your goals both in and outside the gym. I have been apart of Veronicas challenges, her bakery class, tpl classes, and personal training with Brett and they have all helped me reach levels of strength i didn't think I ever could. TPL really becomes apart of you, it becomes your second home and family. If you are in the area go sign up NOW!!!<//Text>

Ummm I’m sorry for the people that had a bad experience but I can tell y’all right now that that TPL is legit an uplifting place that teaches how to lift and learn about yourself. Not only are the trainers supportive but they literally will watch every moment to help with your form if you’re struggling or if you’re not getting it. These trainers are here to help out people that are trying to learn. I’ve been doing PT with Veronica for almost a year and she is supportive as well as informative. She pushes you to the limits you never thought you could reach. This gym is by far one of the best in the valley. ALOT of people can and WILL agree that the owner did an amazing job opening up a place that encourages growth physically and mentally.</Review>

I joined TPL March Madness 2018 and started doing personals with Veronica in April. I am beyond thankful for her and everybody with the TPL fam. The level of love and support while getting things done at the same time is unmatched. People look at me like I’m crazy when I tell them I drive 40 minutes each way to go to the gym but I couldn’t imagine training with anybody else.</review>

<Review>I was told about The Performance Lab years ago by a late family friend. He worked out at the TPL classes and always said how amazing they were and felt they helped him progress to a “next level training”. I always wanted to start working out at this gym based on the reviews he had told me but am a bit shy and felt a little intimidated. Fast forward several years later, a different friend of mine mentioned to me how she was able to get in the best shape of her life working out with a trainer named Veronica. After researching this “Veronica” aka “Vee” I realized she is a trainer at The Performance Lab! I decided to get out of my comfort zone and do something different and I’m so glad I did! Veronica is the best trainer. She makes me feel so comfortable. She is professional, knowledgeable, patient, motivating and very understanding. She also is strong and pushes you to do things she knows you can even if you don’t think it( box jumps..ugh). This is my second month working out with Vee and it has changed my life. I’m so grateful to her and this wonderful establishment that is dedicated to helping people. Thank you Vee for being the best!< /Review>< pics>

I have been going to TPL for ten months now. My trainer is Veronica who is just AMAZING! Veronica has been an excellent motivator since day 1, always with a positive mood, ensuring that you get the best out of your workout and challenge yourself. She is a genuine soul with enthusiasm to help you. I have attended other gyms, and by far, my experience at TPL has been the best. The trainings are challenging but never disappointing. Overall the environment at TPL is just incredible; the staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and supportive. If you are ready to take the step to challenge yourself physically and mentally, TPL is the place for you, you will not be disappointed.</Text>

TPL is one of the BEST gyms I have ever been too! Such a positive family friendly environment. All the  trainers are extremely helpful if you have any questions they won’t hesitate to answer. Vee is such an amazing person uplifting women in and out the gym. I can definitely speak highly of. Brett (the owner) is also really helpful he not only has helped me reach my goals physically he has also given me the opportunity to be a vendor for my small business and for many other small businesses. He is always willing to lend a hand for his community. I don't go to TPL just to workout I go because it not only helps me physically but mentally as well. I’m all about POSITIVITY and TPL is the place to be!🙌🏼</review>

< Review>
I started training at tpl at the end of 2019 and start of 2020. Specifically because of the great reviews I had heard because of my friends but mainly also because I do martial arts and really needed help on getting stronger. I actually wanted to workout there even before I graduated high-school but I was kinda intimidated because of my body insecurities. However now that I look back on that, I wish I had started sooner. When you start at tpl, the trainers help you and are not judgmental if you can’t do something specifically. I have come a long way but I am so thankful of how much progress I’ve made, thanks to the staff there and their encouragement. To me, tpl is more than just a gym, it’s honestly free therapy. It’s always an hour to myself where I can not only workout but also not have to think about what’s going on in my life. Especially since I am currently in college right now but I honestly wouldn’t want to work out anywhere else because the staff there has no limits when it comes to helping people accomplish their goals and encourage others to always work hard in their workouts. I have trained with Vee (Veronica) in personal training and she is amazing. She is very understanding and motivating. She inspires and gives people confidence in a way that people wouldn’t even think that they would be confident to workout. Which I know maybe could sound cheesy but it’s true. She has helped me accomplish so much in my journey of working out and I wouldn’t have come this far without her. Thank you so much Vee! <3
All the trainers commit so much time to their clients and the individual classes alone. They care and that’s the way every gym should be. I’m very grateful tpl exists (Thank you Brett) because the environment is very uplifting during and people always encourage others when they are not confident to be confident and know that they can do something if it’s hard or if they are tired during the workout. I think that is the most beautiful thing about tpl. Working out is not always a comfortable thing for people, especially in a group setting but knowing others believe in you, even if you don’t know them personally is such a nice feeling.
Also, I know that group settings may not be for everyone but I honestly have never felt tpl to be a judgmental place. So, Thank you to all the trainers and their commitment to helping people get stronger and empowering them!</Review>

i love that going to workout at tpl has been the most consistent thing in my life these past few years. it’s such a fulfilling place and when you go to something everyday, you can IMAGINE how many beautiful relationships you build—with not only other people, but with yourself, your self image, self worth, and confidence as well. it’s definitely one of the main factors in my life that really elevates my well-being. treat yourself yall! get that membership you’ve been iffy about putting money towards and watch yourself grow physically and mentally :’) pro tip: make the most out of your workouts by talking to people!! i know an atmosphere like tpl can be intimidating, especially at first, but that small talk w other members will truly go so far. unlike other traditional gyms, like inshape, tpl allows you to be apart of a community, which is what separates tpl from the rest and has gotta be my favorite thing about the place!</Review>

LOOOVVEEE TPL AND ALL THE TRAINERS ESPECIALLY VERONICA.. THEY ARE SO WELCOMING AND VERY HANDS ON WITH THEIR CLIENTS AS WELL AS CARING.. THEY PUSH YOU TO ALWAYS DO MORE TO SUCCEED AND NEVER ALLOW YOU TO FEEL AS IF YOU COULDN’T.. HAVING VERONICA AS MY TRAINER FOR A WHILE NOW HAS BEEN THE BEST DECISION I MADE FOR MYSELF BECAUSE SHE MADE ME REALIZE WHAT POTENTIAL I HAVE AND HOW FAR I CAN GO.. SHE DOESNT LET YOU SLACK AND THAT SHOWS HOW DEDICATED SHE IS TO HER JOB WHILE MAKING SURE YOU GET THE RESULTS YOU WANT AS LONG AS YOU DO THE WORK AS WELL.. I COULD NEVER GO BACK TO ANY OTHER GYM BECAUSE ITS JUST NOT THE SAME .. FROM THE MINUTE YOU WALK IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND VIBES ARE SO FUN AND UPLIFTING, THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY PUT YOU TO WORK, IT DOESNT FEEL LIKE YOUR SLAVING TIME.. I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND TPL TO ANYONE,  DOESNT MATTER YOUR AGE , YOUR SIZE, YOUR ENTRY LEVEL, OR LIFE STRUGGLES.. THEY MAKE EVERYONE FEEL LUKE FAMILY AND LIKE YOU HAVE A PLACE OF HOME! IT TRULY IS MORE THAN JUST A GYM OR A WORKOUT PLACE WHILE YOUR THERE TO WORK ON YOUR PHYSICAL YOU WILL SLOWLY REALIZE THAT IT ALSO HELPS WITH YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND HOW MUCH OF A WEIGHT LUFTING ENVIRONMENT IT IS, PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY, and EMOTIONALLY ! DONT WAIST YOUR TIME GO CHECK IT OUT AND GUARANTEED YOU WILL NOT TURN AWAY AND WILL BE ADDICTED FOR MORE! 🤗< /Text>

<Review>i’ve been going to TPL for almost 4 years now, and i have to say they’re one of the best gyms in the 209! for the amount i pay, i get an unlimited membership and am allowed to go to any classes, which i personally think is a great deal. the trainers are amazing (every single one of them) and they take the time out of their day to get to know each one of their members. they teach us how to lift properly and continue to inspire us to do better each day. it’s because of TPL that i lost a lot of weight and am able to lift so much now. they also have an all women’s program that is great for anyone, beginners too! i feel comfortable at this gym, it feels like a family and i’m thankful for the friendships i’ve built because i workout here. definitely recommend joining if you’re looking for a great gym in the area. shoutout to Brett, Vee, and Victor for holding it down all these years!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x808566c33afbea79:0x40184b9d8eed6ca5< /GmapID></record>

It was difficult for me to do many physical activities for long periods of time. Though the amount of love, kindness, encouragement, and hope that I recieved from not only the coaches but from fellow attendees is enormous. I have reached goals I never thought I could. If you are scared or nervous about going to the gym or don't know really were to start come to TPL! If you are a female and intimidated by the gym come to TPL 7pm women's only class absolutely amazing. Whatever your goals are come to TPL they will be reached. There is no other gym in any comparison to TPL!!!<//Text>< pictures>

Hi I’m vanessa I just came back from Iraq (military) I was told about this place and was so eager to try and train here and Veronica was extremely rude and very patronizing with the type of questions I had she then told other trainers not to train with me because I was offended and I told her I didn’t like her attitude towards me with the kind of questions that I was asking because I didn’t know what it was what so the founder I contacted the founder which is brat and wanted to complaint on the kind of treatment I got from the staffing and basically he chose their sideI think this company has a lot to learn and I think John needs to step in more because the founder isn’t really doing his job he’d rather turn away clients than to actually help people such shallow people work here and don’t bother going on Instagram because I’ll just block you and not deal with their problems such a waste of a business I’d recommend going to relentless  Modesto they have the best customer service very good gym< /review>

Every business has their pros and cons. The good thing about this facility is that it’s definitely accessible. The cons.. don’t expect support. There’s a guy walking around with a laptop and a girl yelling the instructions with a whistle telling you to hurry up. If you’re a beginner, do not come here. They will not correct your form and you will likely end up injuring yourself. Not for me. The quality just wasn’t worth the price.</review>

<review>I signed up acouple months back went acouple times and stopped going because i have never felt so judged at any gym like i have at this one before! I thought it was going to be a good fit for me because i actually had a hand full of friends that went but almost all my friends stopped going for the same reason it is very unprofessional to talk about the members that go there and their whole team made me feel uncomfortable almost every time i went! I would not reccomend going here for those reasons!</review>< gmapID>

This place made me feel like I was not valued as a member. Very unprofessional I would not recommend this place at all. Definitely save your money. They claim they treat everyone as "family" BS It's like high school with all of the cliques and the fact that the trainers/owner's take part in it it's absolutely ridiculous!< /review>

This place is a place for immature kids to show off. It's over priced and the guys are creeps. The owner tried to say that we owed money even though we hadn't been there for 3 months. We had been trying to cancel but he wouldn't let us without coming in person to hear him say why we shouldn't cancel. Then he threatened to take us to collections for not giving him money for no reason that he wasn't entitled to.  This place is a mixture of all of the things that are wrong with society bundled up in the disguise of a gym, depressing to say the least.< /review>

My experience at this facility left me feeling as though my business was not valued and I was not valued as a member. I had been a member of this facility for almost one year and was abruptly informed I was no longer welcome at this gym. From my understanding, because the owner had an exchange of words with one person who had referred me, my membership was now terminated and me, my fiancé, and brother in law were basically not welcome even though we had no knowledge of the incident mentioned previously and had no involvement what so ever. It was brought to my attention that he felt our membership being terminated ment nothing to him.

Even though I enjoyed the work outs and group sessions, I am in disbelief that a business owner would treat his customers so disposable. I feel this was handled very unprofessionally and am disappointed by the customer service of the owner.

Your business is not valued here.<//review>

This was my first time visiting this location as we normally find ourselves at their Elk Grove-Florin Rd location. No shade to that location but I think this is now my go to for T%. It's located within the Safeway shopping center, so it was a bit busy but I love the location. The interior and well-lit with lots of windows. The screens here are digital unlike their other location. Staff was also extremely attentive and helpful, very similar to their other location. I've never had any issues and this places reinforces their customer service.

They had a new flavor I haven't seen, Hey Sesame which is my hands down favorite. I also picked up two drinks for my wife and daughter and they were both happy with their choices.<//text>

<review>Not sure how this place have super high rating. Exciting to tired it out, however, was really disappointed. Saw the recommended grape drink, but the person told me they ran out of clear boba that comes with this drink, so they asked if I want to sub for another topping. I said honey boba but they charge me when it’s originally comes with boba? This drink come out almost $8, for a cup of grape juice? Not coming back again.< /review>< GmapID>

<Review>I was invited to a Yelp Elite event...boy am I so grateful.  I was able to try a new drink that was absolutely wonderful.

This place is located on S street in Midtown between 18th and 19th street in the same location as Safeway.

As I looked over the menu I decided to order the Okinawa Oreo with boba. It comes with Japanese brown sugar milkshake with oreo.

The flavor was out of this world...the brown sugar coupled with the oreo...I would have never dreamed these two flavors would go so well together. As soon as I took my first sip...I was in dream land...wow wow wow.

I have had boba drinks before...but this one is the best I ever had flavor wise.

The boba was fresh...they have so many other things to choose from I'd your looking for milk too or ube coffee...Panna cotta...coffee drinks or tea drinks.

They also have topping choices or different boba choices such as honey boba...egg pudding...coffee jelly or panda Jelly..  as well as others.

If you love boba drink...I highly recommend this place...trust me...its worth the drive.</Review><Gmap_id>0x809ad1cd3c066231:0xd888f4e8f4d0ee14< /Gmap_id>< Rate>

<Text>Super great sesame smoothie w/ boba!! Also the thai milk tea is awesome!!
They got super friendly staffs too, i rode the bike there and they safely secured the cup holder and the cap!
Also if you’re the type of person who always do sugar free like me, their drinks are not too sweet even when you do 30% ( which is the least amount of sweetness they can do for the sesame smoothie)< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7dZjRQpktTPu7j93YqgDjPkKKryaN0nvEsnhU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x809ad1cd3c066231:0xd888f4e8f4d0ee14</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Not bad. I got the black milk boba. Really nice staff. Warm inside - I’m assuming their AC isn’t working properly since they just opened. Boba was a bit mushier than I prefer. Good overall. I’ll be back to give it another try.</Review><userid>108414421258627638758</userid><GmapID>0x809ad1cd3c066231:0xd888f4e8f4d0ee14< /GmapID><resp>None<//resp><time>1622242585755<//time>< pictures>

<rating>4<//rating><review>Really great tea shop! Their boba is always fresh and the tea is fantastic! The only reason I took off one star is because some of their drinks are just...not very good. If you stick with the classic drinks like matcha or Thai teas, they are really good. The dragon fruit drink needs a little lime to cut down the super sweet. The Grass Hopper drink was awful, and I ended up throwing most of it away (super bummer because of how expensive it was).The other reason why I took a star off is because their floors were dirty. There was so much black dirt tracked in and footprints everywhere.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Just went in today as a new patient. I have really bad anxiety when it comes to the dentist but they helped me ease it. Dr. Tran and Abdul as well as the rest of the staff were so nice ! For the first time ever I actually felt like I was being heard and not ignored . Dr. Tran constantly kept asking me if I was okay and if I needed something to just raise my hand.</Review>< pictures>

I really like going to this dentist. The staff is very friendly and helpful whenever you need to change an appointment. Crystal helped me today with my braces very gentle and professional.  My daughter's enjoy coming here as well when before they hated the dentist. Overall a great experience. Highly recommend<//review>

<Review>was recommended by a friend and I have had a great experience with this office! The staff is very nice and friendly. There have been a few times where I couldn’t make my appointment and the staff was always very helpful with rescheduling my appointments. I got fast braces (which I have never heard before until I came to this dental office) and I was already seeing results by the second week! I would definitely recommend this office!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcd95be09f95cf:0xbeb49f3ab68e2c59< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Smooth dental is the best orthodontist ever. Visit any one of the 3 offices and you won't be disappointed. Dr E.Tran and Dr J.Tran are so amazing and kind. Dr Richard M is an artist when it comes to cleaning your teeth, he has the softest hands in the game.<//Text>

<Text>Highly recommend! I hadn’t been to the dentist in a long time and I was really nervous, but I was welcomed in without judgement or criticism. Their team has taken incredible care of me, from fillings, cleaning, to education, every staff member has been not only professional but incredibly kind. I’m so grateful I found this dental office!< /Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< userid>

They are very good with their work, I was very comfortable, everyone is nice. I like the environment. As soon as I walk in they have great music (80s haha) and their chairs are comfy with massage features, everything is clean and tidy. Oneyda and everyone who work there are doing an amazing job!</review>

<Text>My experience getting fast braces was amazing! I saw my teeth moving within 2 weeks! The reason why I decide to get fast braces was because i wanted to have a perfect smile :)
It only took me about 4 months to have the smile I've  always dreamed of!
Ive been visiting Smooth Dental around the age of 10 and now im 24
I now  bring my 3 boys!
I totally recommend this place! The staff here are very friendly, kind, & always try to find a way to help you out!
Not only are they very lovely but they make you feel like family!
I love this place it's amazing!

Thank you Dr. Tran! & everyone for their help!</Text></record>

Such a great office. I immediately felt like family here! I had zero anxiety while I was being treated. I felt heard and everything was explained to me crystal clear from treatment options to how my insurance works. They have all of the start of the art equipment at their facilities. They have massage chairs that relax you and keep your mind off the drilling. I’m so glad I found this practice. The Dr’s here are sisters and they are so lively but most importantly they treat you like a person and not just a patient.< /review>

<review>The team at Smooth Dental Group is truly amazing & have become like family over the past few weeks. I came in thinking I had to have my wisdom teeth pulled out but they were quick to realize I had a different issue. Everyone was so sensitive to me and my pain the day I first came in and went above and beyond to make me feel at ease and comfortable. Since then; I’ve had more work done here, including a deep cleaning of my teeth and gums and I’ve never felt my teeth and gums so healthy. The hygienist, Richard is truly amazing! He is kind & made me feel at ease throughout the entire process. I cannot say it enough, the team is truly the best! Everyone here makes you feel right at home. The doctors are amazing!! I would recommend Smooth Dental to everyone.<//review>< Pictures>

So when I found out that my left wisdom tooth was the cause of my pain for months. I made an appointment but I put it off for weeks. Canceling back and forth, but when it was to much I went. And honestly the specialist that was working there did an amazing job. We were done fairly quick and I felt no pain at all. This Dentist made my whole experience not fear getting them out. The healing process has gone by smoothly and I’ve had no issues. I will be going back to take out my right side. Great job guys thank you.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<review>I got the fast braces recommended by Dr.Tran and within there week I have noticed my top teeth look straight already.  Fast braces are a bit painful at times but it will hopefully only be for a few months compared to two years. I had braces before for two years and my teeth shifted back after they were taken off.   I'm very thankful that the staff here (Jimmy, Larry, Richard and Dr. Tran) have taken the time to explain about fast braces and really care about the results.< /review>< rate>

Front staff are extremely  wonderful and welcoming. Shout out to Ana, Jose and Chi. Dr. Tran is extremely knowledgeable and has take care of my chompers. Larry and Richard and rest of the dental staff have been part of my dental journey and I still have some ways to go they never make me feel bad about my teeth but find solutions to make my  feel a lot better.  They really take their time and connect with patients to make sure that everything is going well.<//Review>

Oh, WOW!!! That's my expression when I first came to this new office. I've been their patients for years and so have my kids, siblings... Besides a nice office with up-to-date technology, all doctors are incredibly nice and professional, especially Dr. E. Tran. The staffs are also very welcoming and always with a smile. I wouldn't go anywhere else for my dental needs...<//review>

<review>I want everyone to know how amazing Smooth Dental is!! I have always been afraid to go to the dentist office since I was a kid and continued thru adulthood.  I no longer feel that because of the great Drs and staff at Smooth Dental. They have made me feel like part of there family, everyone is there to help you get through anything. I have just recently finished with the Fastbrace program, I had crowded teeth on the bottom and thought that was all. I was wrong, the program in just a few months change my whole bite.  I now have straighter teeth along with a better bite. I was amazed on how this works so fast and effectively.  I would recommend this to anyone who is thing about doing this, it's well worth it.  Thank you to the Dr Tran Sister and staff for making it easy for me, you all have made me a believer again !!❤❤❤❤<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

If you're not a patient of Dr. Tran at Smooth Dental, then do yourself a favor and give them a chance.  I have little doubt that you will soon be firing your current dentist.  I've been to many dentist offices with experiences ranging from so-so to absolute nightmare.  Dr. Tran and her staff are different and have managed to keep me smiling for more than 10 years.

When I first met Dr. Tran, I was like many people, afraid of dentists, ashamed to smile, and in pain as a result of botched procedures and my own ignorance of how to properly maintain my teeth.  Not only did they fix my 'grill', they actually changed my life.  I smile all the time now and it's wonderful to see the response that I get when I greet people with a warm confident smile.  Thanks Dr. Tran!<//Text>

I used to suffer from jaw locking and cracking every time I opened my mouth and thanks to the fast braces I feel that my jaw is stronger and my bone has been formed in the proper way and it will help prevent any jaw popping in the future.</review>

<Review>I came to this office for 3 wisdom 🦷 extractions but I was nervous, anxious, scared you name it!!! I was introduced to Dr. Nguyen and he began by putting the anestesia, i felt a slight poke but that’s it...then 5 minutes later he says” okay keep the area clean, don’t eat anything spicy, crunchy...”. I couldn’t believe he was all done!! Two weeks later I got my last wisdom tooth extracted and same as the first time, no pain and was in and out in less then 10 minutes.  That Doctor knows how to do his job beautifully!!! I WOULD WITHOUT ANY DOUBT RECOMMEND DR.  NGUYEN!!!!! Thank you Dr.  Nguyen for doing such an awesome and amazing job!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

FASTbraces although a new kind of braces work really well. they move your tooth and bone not only that but you feel the movement everyday and there’s no pain. i’ve had them for 4 months and i’m almost done. i wish i would have known about them sooner. i highly recommend them to anyone who wants great results.< /Review>

I've been looking for braces that would improve my teeth, and I came across Smooth Dental Group. They told me about Clear Correct and it's probably the best decision I've made.</Review>

I have coming to this dentist for over a yr now and I see a huge difference in my teeth. I don't kknow why I waited so long but now it's done and feels better. I also met José at the 4th street location and he was so helpful. Very easy going guy to talk to and presentable which is always a plus. All staff is so nice and get good vibes when going to either location .< /text>

<review>I came here on a friend's recommendation. I was pleasantly surprised when I was greeted by Jose and Anna at the front and they helped me check in. After the short paperwork, I was called in and had the xrays done. Perla is super great! She helped me feel comfortable while I waited for Dr. Jackie, like putting on a movie and a massage chair! (Whaaaaat?!)
Dr. Jackie and Jason talked me through what I needed to do for my teeth and answered all of my questions patiently. Richard the hygenist has gentle hands and is fast. Dr. Nguyen was also very nice and careful when working on my teeth. Dr. Elizabeth is great too, very professional and friendly. The staff here is friendly and loves to talk to patients. I was in and out really quick but never felt rushed. I've never had great dental experiences but this place is changing that.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I will write another comment at the end of my dental correction treatment with Clear correct for a low price compared to other dental offices.

<Review>On vacation in San Francisco with my family and I was in the mood for some Nicaraguan food. My cousin recommended Rinconcito Nicaragua, he's usually on point with his recommendations. Let's just say he faild on this one. The chia was more sugar than chia and my carne Asada was as salty as the San Francisco bay. Another negative was one cook was eating while cooking and the other's were not wearing their mask correctly. I guess southern California still reigns supreme as California's best Nicaraguan food.

<text>Love this place. Me and the wife decided to walk down mission st deciding what to eat and decided to go back to Riconcito Nica.
This time we got the house special, I call it, Fritanga.
There is so much food that is plenty for 2-3 people.
Plate is loaded with staek, pork, gallopinto, Maduro, queso Frito, and much more, and to top it off, pickled onions 😋.
Definitely a must try</text><user_name>Leonel Callejas< /user_name><Date>1542428578307< /Date><Rate>5</Rate><UserId.>118202509717751539420</UserId.>< resp>

Typically a family oriented restaurant with friendly staff and regulars that visit frequently to sit comfortably and enjoy a delicious Nicaraguan meal.  Every known favorite dish is available on the menu.  The wait is considerably long, but worth it. The only downfall that I can honestly say is that Sunday's music plays a bit too loud, and found myself having to raise my voice above the comfort zone to be heard.  Overall, I recommend Rinconcito Nicaraguense for your next Nicaraguan Food cravings.< /review>

Music so loud couldn't hear anything else. Pork dry. Fish was really good. Bathroom dirty with throw up in sink. Best thing about restaurant was waitress. She was patient accommodating and did everything within her power to make our experience a good one. Unfortunately the really really loud music and bathroom cleanliness was a total turn off. Out of a few menu items as well so can't rate anything but fish and pork. Fish yummy pork not so much.</text>

I freaking LOVE this place! Food is so authentic and mind you its the only Nicaraguan restaurant  where customer service still exist ! My son asked for a specific plate and when it came , it looked differently then in the menu, so the owner Ramon rearranged the plate and changed the plate itself to a skillet as shown in the picture. I was bought! Great food, great people.< /Review>

Very authentic nicaraguan food, would recommend getting Carne asada, gallo pinto, tajadas verde, and queso frito. To drink definitely get a cacao</review>

<Text>Horrible place ! I waited for 30 min to be served , the waiter was great considering there are only two of them and it was quite busy . I asked him if they had buñuelos when I was seated and he said yes . When I asked for an order of them after I finished my meal,he said they don’t have any because they can’t fry them and the queso frito at the same time ! WTF ???? The pork I ordered was dry and it was too loud !!!Why is there a DJ at a restaurant during the day ? I couldn’t have a conversation . I was so annoyed to spend 2 and 1/2 hrs there .To top it off they want tips in cash , how inconvenient !!!!<//Text>< resp>

<Text>The food was ok actually, and my waitress actually tried to do a good job, in spite of what appeared to be the boss yelling profanities(in Spanish) about why were they just standing around, and that he didn't give a #$&@ if they, or any guests, didn't like his tone. Anyway, that was unpleasant.</Text>< username>

I really would not recommend this place. First time in SF. Went to this restaurant since my husband and bro-in-law are nicaraguense. Didn't have the plate my bro-in-law or I ordered. Waitress was not in the best if moods. So, no. Would nit go back again!</Review>

I ordered a medium 2 topping pizza and a green salad through their menu on Slice Pizza. I received the food the pizza tastes sour and the salad didn't have the topping it says it comes with that shows in the picture. I had to throw away the pizza it tasted funny. Waste of $20</Review>

But for some reason over the last couple of  months it tastes different. It tastes like very cheap pizza. My friends have the same opinion. The sauce tastes like ketchup.

I'd give it five stars but these guys need to buy a warmer for their finished pizzas cause I hate going home with my cold pizza and placing slices in the microwave 😒 no one likes cold pizza.<//Review>< pictures>

Been here a few times and the pizza is better than most places around here. The pepperoni pizza special cannot be beat by Lil ceaser pizza it's way more delicious and made to order. Can't pass this place up you are missing out.< /Review>

$5.50 Large pepperoni special! The pizza was ready in about 10 minutes and it came out fresh and hot. We also ordered some BBQ wings because I was craving for some, they were good enough and satisfied me. Very friendly folks here.<//Text>

ok first of all i went to affordable dentures, and had the worst experience there,  then i found Brimhall... what a wonderful smart and talented dentist he is.  i went in there with no top teeth and he made me some beautiful teeth that really fit my mouth.  i left with a smile on my face and still have one.. this is the place to go to if needed..  love them all there. friendly office staff too.  and helpful.  i cant say enough good about  the  doctor  there..<//text>

Jen was amazing calmed my nerves and totally put me at ease she did great work all around. She made me feel enthusiastic about my return to the dentist versus the usual dread you feel thinking of everything you've done wrong. Everyone was literally perfect I couldn't ask for a better experience. Thanks guys!!!!!< /text>

Everyone I interacted with was reassuring, understanding, and friendly.

I definitely recommend anyone to go to Brinmhall Dental Group for excellent service! Dr. Simpson and all of the supporting ladies were amazing. They were all so knowledgeable and explained in detail what they were doing throughout the entire procedure. I went there in hopes of fixing a crown I had on my front tooth that made me feel self conscious for years. I am so happy with the end result of my front teeth procedure. I am so much more confident with my smile 😁< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>This dentistry is by far the best one I’ve come across. Their office is clean, the staff are professional, and polite. They also have great systems in place to keep the flow of the patients moving. This team has high standards and operates in efficiency and excellence. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for high-quality service.

I also want to give a shout out to my hygienist Jennifer for having such a lovely personality and for making me laugh each time I go. I genuinely enjoy going to the dentist now because of her and her team.<//Review>< Pictures>

This was by far one of the best dental offices I have been to. The doctors are very friendly and honest. They don’t seem like they are out to get u for as much money as they can. The staff was very friendly, and they got me back to the room within 2 min of my appointment.< /review>

I had a fantastic experience. My dentist of almost 30 years couldn’t get me in to Re-seat a crown.
The Brimhall dental staff was awesome! They not only made me an appointment within a weeks time, they even moved it up when they received a cancellation. The receptionist/biller at the front desk was really friendly and professional as well as the other staff members. Dr. Simpson was wonderful. He explained everything in detail throughout the entire process. I haven’t been too thrilled with my current dentists office or his staff for some time now. I think I have found a new dental office when this pandemic is over. Thank you to all of the staff that helped me during these crazy times!</Review>

Brimhall dental group is a very inviting office. The front office personnel were very helpful with the sign in process. The dental hygienist
Was great. Very kind and pleasant   She did her job
Proficiently and without discomfort. The dental assistant was also very good. I had time getting the x rays done but she took it slow and we were able to complete the exam. Dr, K did an exam and looked at my xrays and gave me a full explanation of the results. He was very personable and likeable! I am so
Happy I have a new dentists office after my previous dentist retired! Thanks<//Review>

I moved here recently didn't have a dentist, called them with a issue they got me in the next morning, letting me download registration papers online to avoid waiting in lobby due to virus.
Staff was quite helpful dr was Dr. Chris they call him last name hard to pronounce.
He sat with me made me feel comfortable, explained xrays,  would recommend  Brimhall Dental to anyone and have an appt for a return.< /Text>

<Review>So I've been struggling with finding a dentist that makes me comfortable and doesn't give me the run around. I've had two appointments so far and both times I've felt so welcome! I first met with Courtney and she was such a doll! I then met Dr Simpson who gave me a good explanation of what I needed done and what they can offer. It was a quick visit which I didn't mind. I had my second appointment yesterday where I was with the hygienist Jennifer who is just amazing! She was gentle and kept making sure I was comfortable during my cleaning. Met with Dr Simpson again and I just kept getting good vibes from everyone. The environment is amazing! She and I had a great conversation throughout my exam (it was like a little over an hour and a half long lol I needed some work!) and had a lot of laughs especially when I gargled water up onto my face and just couldn't stop laughing. It was as if I was with an old friend. That's how comfortable this office made me feel. I feel like a weight has been lifted since finding their office. I can't imagine going anywhere else now.<//Review>< Pics>

I have been to this dental group with my son.  I had been having trouble with a tooth for about a week and gave them a call on Monday morning. I explained my situation and they were able to get me in that day.  I was early and filled out my paperwork and was taken back  a few minutes after I had filled out my paperwork. The assistant and the doctor were very courteous and explained to me what happened and  I decided to have the work done that day. I was prepped and the work was done. They made sure I wasn't in any pain during the procedure, which I wasn't. The doctor explained when I was finished that if I had an issues over the next week to please call. I am not one who likes dentists but this office has made it an enjoyable experience.</text>

Did a good job.  Dr. K (don't know how to spell his last name) took time to educate me somewhat about what's going on with my teeth. I like understanding why I need something done other than having the Dr just tell me.  He's good about helping you understand. Also, he wasn't too aggressive with his treatment plan which I liked.<//review>

The staff was great! As most of us do not like Dentist visits, these gals at the front desk put me at ease from the start. Dr Simpson was great also. Fixed my chipped tooth same day and made sure I was happy before I left the office. I fully recommend BDG to anyone looking for a new Dentist!!</text>

The dentist Dr. Kiuftis was great, I had to have an extraction and did not feel a thing. Staff was pleasant and helpful through the whole experience. Finally a dentist that I don't dread going to.</Review>

<time>1557587480251</time><Response>None<//Response><review>I had not been to the dentist in 20 years and I had an emergency dental problem and was referred to Brimhall Dental and Dr Simpson ! I ended Dr K and he was awesome!  The whole staff was extremely kind and professional!  I mentioned I was nervous of dental and they are so amazing with there treatment!  I had and extraction done and it was literally pretty much painless! They made sure that I had pain relief and they were very quick and extremely proficient in what they did! The staff is very very kind and money is not their top priority. They brought me back to see what was going on and and figured out plans and never mentioned or asked for  any type of money and then when we were done they knew that I was going to be paying cash I made that very evident upfront and they came up with a very good plan as to where I could make payments also it was nowhere near what I thought it was going to cost meaning they're very very good with their pricing and understand that not everyone's rich and most people don't have dental insurance! So I would recommend them to anyone they even see kids and their staff is so kind and professional and their dentist are amazing they explain everything they're doing and why they're doing it and they do it very gently and they have gained a patient for life for me and also my kids so I would totally recommend anybody to go here they make the whole Dental process a breeze I actually enjoy going to their office! So if you're looking for a dentist stop here and look no more they're awesome!<//review><pics>None</pics>< user_id>

<text>spent the whole night in horrible pain. Called this place gave them my insurance policy. They were quick to get me in. They then present me with a $961 bill for ONE tooth. WAIT A MINUTE I HAVE INSURANCE. THEY KNEW I WAS OUT OF NETWORK BUT DIDNT BOTHER TELLING ME. THEY WANT YOUR MONEY ITS UNACCEPTABLE TO PRACTICE THAT WAY. The DR seemed nice better be for that price. DO NOT SUPPORT PRICE Gougers<//text>< Rate>

Dr. Simpson and his staff are the nicest people you’ll meet and come in contact with. When I arrive early in the morning, Dr. Simpson and his staff are meeting in the back I would imagine going over their daily schedule and you can hear them interacting with one another and laughing together which shows that the office staff works very well together and I’m sure that the moral there is very high and it definitely shows. I just wished I had come across Dr. Simpson years ago for my dentist. Thank You from one happy and smiling patient.< /text>

<review>Dr. Simpson is very honest and thorough. I've never been advised to fix something that doesn't need fixing. Plus, all the staff here is friendly and fun to be around. They make the experience of "going to the dentist" a positive one. I never look forward to going, but these guys are great!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>Always a great experience coming into Brimhall Dental Group. The staff are so friendly & sweet. Ms. Shavon literally knows me by name when I call in to schedule appointments. Dr. Simpson himself is always so informative & does such a great job with making sure everything goes smoothly and that you're as comfortable as possible. I used to be deathly afraid of going to the dentist but this place has changed my outlook on all of it.< /Text>< Pictures>

The staff and doctors at Brimhall Dental are amazing. Doctor Kiuftis has always been so kind and attentive to us. After being afraid of going to the dentist for years, my daughter now looks forward to going.  She likes Dr K so much that she asked me to call him when she lost a tooth so she could tell him. Such a great dentist and staff.</review>

<Review>It is always a hassle and daunting looking for a great dentist. My husband had pain and turned out to need a root canal.  He was very satisfied with how he was treated and procedure.  He felt no pain or discomfort during the procedure.  We are so thankful we found Brimhall Dental Group!  They are courteous and professional.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>I  highly recommend Jared Simpson, over the years i've been to several dentist, they do not compare to the quality you get at Brimhall Dental. He is caring of your dental needs. The  atmosphere is very relaxing, modern, clean. I bring my 6 year old here as well he makes him feel relaxed and not afraid, my little one always looks forward to the treasure chest of toys after treatment.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80ea43cc8321fa83:0x486c6b32c6d026c0< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I was very nervous about my first visit. But the staff and Dr. Simpson made me feel at ease.  I will be having treatment on Thursday and, although I’m anxious, I trust that I am going to get wonderful treatment.</Review>

<text>My six year old was in a lot of pain from a toothache resulting from some poor fillings having been done at a different dentist office. I contacted Brimhall Dental Group after hearing positive things about the office and staff. They had my son in the very next day! Immediately upon walking in, the front desk greeted us and were friendly and helpful in directing me to complete my forms on the computer kiosk set up in the lobby. It was quick and easy! Unlike old school pen and paper I didn’t mind the new patient forms! We were taken back quickly and every staff member from the front desk to who did his xrays, every dental assistant and the dentist himself were polite, friendly and made my son who had walked in nervous and in pain both comfortable and laughing! While walking in to the office my son was nervous and anxious on the verge of tears, but to my surprise and delight ended the visit saying how much he liked the office, how clean it was and how he couldn’t wait to come back. I ended up booking my other son as well as my future cleanings with them as well. I highl recommend Brimhall Dental Group!</text>< Pics>

What a ripoff!  Told one price when calling, after sitting in a chair for 30 minutes they increase the offer 6 times higher!  I paid $100 for the privilege of sitting in the chair!!!!  Stay away</Text>

If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would, they are just that good. So my grandma dropped and broke in half her bottom dentures on Thursday evening. My mom and I were panicked because we weren't sure if she would be able to eat (she doesn't have any teeth left in the back), and it was going to be the weekend so we figured we were going to have a hard time trying to find someone to help with fixing them. So I called Brimhall Dental Group Friday morning at 8:15am, the receptionist(Shavon) was at first hesitant saying that we wouldn't be able to get anything done until Monday, so I explained that I didn't know the severity of it for I didn't know if my grandma could. So Shavon called her lab to if it was possible, she quickly called me back and told me to meet her at the office so that the lab could pick them up. I dropped off the denture at 8:45am and got a phone call at 11:30am saying that they were finished. The amount of time they put in to accommodate us (who have never been here) and the politeness, I haven't experienced good customer service like this in a very long time! Would totally recommend 10/10!<//Text>

I live right across from it and usually see them open by 5 sometimes 4am and sometimes they stay open past 2pm like now.. Its 7pm and they're still open lol</Text>< response>

Momma is the best! Best donuts, best coffee, and she has always made me feel like a part of the family. Highly recommend. She also has a great referral for anyone looking for a Medicare Advantage Health Plan.< /text>

<Review>Great donuts but I won't be going back, No milk, no cream, no half-and-half, nothing but chemical "creamer." I've asked and asked and asked...
nothing. I give up. It's just another another block or two to Miss Donuts, where they care about what the customers want.<//Review><GmapID>0x80c33424def2c88f:0x64b11e306e26dd3e< /GmapID>< Resp>

It was my initial visit as a new patient and I couldn't be any happier.  The office is beautiful and modern.  The staff was welcoming and hospitable.  My appointment was for a routine cleaning and it was an absolute breeze.  I felt like I've known the staff for years, every step in the appointment was explained and my comfort was their priority.  Thank you! You've gained a patient for life!< /Review>

I’ve been going to La Jolla Family Smile Design for many years. I’ve always felt well taken care of by highly professional and extremely competent and gifted dentists, hygienists and technicians. They have the latest dental equipment and are practicing Covid protocols to provide a safe space for patients and employers/employees. They’re the greatest!!< /Text>

<Text>I've been a patient of La Jolla Family Smile Design for a little while now and I wanted to really congratulate the office on being A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. I've had a chance to interact with a lot of the staff. I go in for my cleaning every few months and Zoe always does a great job. I recently completed my Invisalign treatment and Dr.B and Diana took excellent care of me and I LOVE MY SMILE now. I needed to get into the office urgently one day and not only was I accommodated but well taken care of by Dr.Vazquez and later by Dr.Blok. What can I say- this is a fantastic office that has always made me feel welcomed (from the second I walk in the door and am greeted) and always walked me through my options. Thank you La Jolla Family Smile Design for going that extra mile.</Text>< rate>

Most excellent experience.  Had a cap removed, decay removed and new cap put on.  From start to completion in 90 minutes the most professional and pain free procedure I could have imagined.  It’s never fun, but this was non stressful. Thank you Dr Breziner & team.</text>

I was in need of my first crown and put it off for months because I was so fearful. I had it finally completed yesterday, along with a filling and it was a wonderful experience. I am so thankful for the Dr and his friendly staff. They took breaks for me and explained what they were doing all along the way. I felt no pain and was thankful to have come here for it.</Review>

<Text>Dr. Breziner charged me multiple times for a small chip in my front tooth, I was not happy with his services so I left.  For over a year LJFSD has been sending me a bill for a "missed appointment" that I did not make.  I switched to a dentist that is cheaper and can fix a problem the first time.<//Text><username>Robert P< /username><Time>1622611540284< /Time>< user_id>

Dr Breziner and his office are so professional and make sure every detail from the cleanliness of the office to the scheduling and reminders of your appointment and of course most important your dental work is done perfectly. They never try to oversell you services but are honest about what you need and the costs. It is such a pleasure to have such an honest and trustworthy dentist. Very grateful for the terrific cafe I receive.<//Text>

I love this place. The office is lovely, the environment is very relaxing, and the entire staff is fantastic. Every single person I've met who works here is so nice, so personable, and professional. I don't have health insurance, but they offer a plan that made getting regular treatments very affordable for me. The care they extend to their patients is top notch. I never thought I'd enjoy going to the dentist so much.
You can also watch any Netflix shows or movies of your choice while they work on you as well! For the record, Casino Royale is a great movie to watch while getting your teeth worked on. ;)<//Review>

<review>Got me in for a broken crown right away. I was able to get it fixed and out the door in 2 hours with a new one cemented in. Usually go to Dr B but he was not available so was treated by Dr Vasquez. He was great, gentle and efficient. Great office, always friendly and do wonderful dentistry.<//review>< Pictures>

The entire staff here is friendly, professional, and very thorough... Zoe, my Hygienist, does an outstanding job and provides valuable feedback on anything I need to address. Zoe takes the time to recommend dental products and cleaning methods that have worked well for me. I highly recommend LJ Family Smile Design!<//text>

< review>
We scheduled a treatment for my daughter. We purchased a plan with La Jolla Family Smile Design as we didn't have any dental insurance. I told that my daughter has cavities. They found the cavity on 30th tooth. Before that my wife told me before that my daughter has a back spot on that tooth and we should go to the dental clinic. This is why we went to the clinic. I gave the permission and "green light" to make full treatment at the clinic. The doctor said that they did 4 feelings and everything is now perfect. I paid about $900. That everything my wife said that it looks like nothing happened. In next two weeks we scheduled a dental cleaning. After the cleaning we found out that 30 tooth has cavity. I took the previous  records which shows treatment of 30 tooth. Now I need to make new treatment from "another side" of the tooth. They forgot to apply the plan, so I overpaid for that. My wife called to their financial controller about the refund and also she shared the concerns about this malpractice. We still got no reply. Money doesn't matter. I would prefer to come once and avoid multiple visits. I am disappointed with these false statements, incompetence and overcharge. I cannot find proper words about this clinic.<//review>

Dr. Breziner and his amazing team gave me the smile of my dreams. They were always so kind and welcoming every time I walked in to that office ensuring I was as comfortable as possible. I have never loved a dental office more. No one really enjoys going to the dentist but Dr. B actually cares about his patients and really wants them to be completely satisfied, I’ve never experienced anything like it!. I can’t give them enough praise for the way they run their office. I highly recommend them!!</text>

I can recommend La Jolla Family Smile Design with all my heart. The whole staff is very professional and friendly.  My family has have the very best experience. It all started with my husband’s crooked teeth. I really thought his teeth were a lost cause. After little over a year and Dr. Breziner’s treatment with Invisalign , my husband’s teeth were perfect. Not in my wildest dream did I think it was possible. That led me to start Invisalign too. I’m very happy with my teeth and as an extra benefit my old jaw pain has disappeared. Thank You Dr. Breziner.< /review>

This is the best dentist I've been to! They have advanced technology and address even the smallest issues to prevent larger, more expensive, ones in the future. They performed tests and exams on me, and showed me a fantastic overview of everything going on with my teeth. I wouldn't go anywhere else! The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend!!<//review>

I was impressed with the level of forensic research he was able to employ in a very short amount of time.  He knew exactly what my Dental history was and what I needed to improve my Dental health, and further had a plan me.

Singularly outstanding experience.  Drs Breziner and Vasquez are, in my estimation, the two finest dentists in California.  Their priority is the patient's  comfort and safety, which I very much appreciate.  On this visit Dr. Vasquez was solicitous and highly professional.  Five Stars.<//Text>

I first found Dr Jaime Breziner by word of mouth. Not just once, but several people I know spoke very highly of him and his staff. I will tell you first hand, as a patient, that Dr Breziner’s dental work is state-of-the-art perfection! He has a great chair side manner that is both professional and comforting. In addition, Dr Breziner’s dental hygienists, assistants and front office staff are highly qualified, personable, and always willing to go above and beyond.

I have referred several of my family members to this office and they have all been very pleased with the work they have had done and with their overall experience.

My wife visited the office complaining of pain in her mouth and upper teeth.
Told that she might have angina but no problem in mouth.  Sinus pain not even mentioned as possible cause.  Billed for $ 194 after being asked if she had insurance.  We have been patients for over 20 years and a  30 minute visit with no diagnosis is a waste of time and money.  Thank you for your help.  We will be looking for a new dentist.</text>

<text>If you are looking for a new dentist, look no further!!! My husband and I have been patients at La Jolla Family Smile Design for the past 12 years. The front-office staff is always welcoming and accommodating. Our current hygienist, Anastasia, is extremely professional, pleasant and thorough offering individual techniques for daily tooth care. For routine dental services, Dr. Breznier, commonly referred to as Dr. B, and his dental assistants provide excellent care. When he administers a novocaine, it is literally pain free!!!! Major kudos for the safety measures they have implemented during this pandemic. 😊< /text><time>1605708382959<//time>< gmap_id>

<Review>This was my second visit to the office and I had a great experience once again. First off, I was really impressed with the measures they established due to Covid-19. I had almost no contact with anyone other than my Dr. and the technician who was assisting him. I was nervous about going to a medical office but once there I felt very comfortable.

The procedure itself was so cool! I was able to get the whole thing including a permanent crown in the same visit. The Dr. and technician were so nice and kept me reassured throughout the whole procedure. I was comfortable and had no pain throughout the whole process. It was EASY and pain free.<//Review>< rate>

I normally don't leave reviews, but I'm making an exception in this case because that's how stellar my dental appointments were. I felt like the whole team was genuinely concerned for my comfort and wellbeing. Dr. Vasquez attentively listened to me explain the concerns I had, and gained my trust - that is not easy in the dentistry world, I think! Thank you all!<//text>

<text>I am a long term client with only good thoughts with Dr. Breziner and La Jolla Family Design.  Every time I go I am greeted with a smile and a personal greeting (I’m sure they know who’s coming but they always greet me specifically - it makes me feel welcome).  I have always been treated by the staff working on my teeth nicely and professionally, while politely  nudged to take care of my teeth better, which I now do.  I would be embarrassed to show the before pictures, but the after and now pictures I would gladly display with pride and I smile a lot more.  The prices are fair but the treatment is better and I would never go anywhere else.  Don’t go anywhere else your smile would turn upside down.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Name>Bruce Koren< /Name>< date>

The last dental visit yesterday was exceptionally gentle and pain-free...I had the crown repair procedure and a new crown made all in one visit...last evening I felt no discomfort from that procedure and am very pleased to say it went so well I would recommend them to anyone looking for the best dental services in town...My husband also needed to see them this past Monday and also received superb attention and care..< /text>

<text>Dr. Jaime Breziner and his staff are truly a class act. They have treated me as a patient for over 20 years and I’ve always felt I’m a welcomed family member there.  I believe Dr. Breziner and his staff take pride in their work and do an above average dental work.  Thank you La Jolla Family Smile Design for taking great care of me!</text>< name>

<review>Dr. Breziner and his staff care about you.  They listen.  And they are skilled.

Update November 2020:   I needed a new crown and the entire procedure, from removing the old crown, cleaning out the area and installing the new crown was accomplished in just one visit.  No more temporary crown, waiting up to two weeks for the permanent one and returning for a second visit.  Dr. Breziner now has a specialist, Brian, who is not only professionally skilled at making crowns right in the office, he is also upbeat and made the time pass quickly.  When the Novocain wore off, I discovered that the new crown fit perfectly and that the color matched my surrounding teeth.< /review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dc03fcc3f6aa01:0xc52de0d9e26a43d0< /gmapID></record>

Dr. B is very knowledgeable, plus he’s got all the cool new technology! I had gotten a recommendation that I needed a crown, but I didn’t think it was right so I went to Dr. B for a consultation, but I will be switching over to his office. Staff is super friendly.< /Review>

I have been going to this dental office for 20 years - even though I’ve moved way across town. I can’t say enough great things. On the one hand, everyone is very friendly, upbeat, nice and personable. I’ve never had an unpleasant or hard visit. Even better, the whole team is an A+ team in their techniques, treatments, equipment and craft. This translates into easy, fast, pain-free, quality care.  I recently had a partial crown put in and I was delighted about how easy it was and comfortable. This team delivers on all fronts.<//Review>

This is Becky Trepte, not Tavia.  However she has also been seen by Dr. Romanowsky.  I am always enthusiastic about coming to the office and being seen by the doctors and hygienists.  Everyone wants to help and be sure you are satisfied with your visit and their work. I am. This is a top notch dentist office and totally worth it in every way.<//text>

Anastasia was absolutely amazing to work with. She was very professional throughout all of my visits and catered to who I am as an individual not just as a patient. She was so passionate about the work she was doing that it made me feel like she truly did the best possible job. I couldn't ask for a better experience and I will continue to request Anastasia to treat me and will always be a patent at La Jolla Family Smile Design as long as I live in California...Thank you all so much!< /Review>

<text>Thanks to Dr. Jaime Breziner, my teeth are in the best shape of my life!  I’ve always made dental care a priority.....have seen my past dentists every 6 months, or more my entire life....and thought my previous dental professionals were the best.  Despite their credentials,  Boston area dental school ranking or faculty positions, I was proven wrong.

At 65 years old, I moved to San Diego, and came to the dentist my friend and her family enthusiastically recommended:  Dr. Jaime Breziner.  My first appointment was, literally,  an eye opener.  His evaluation included a live camera close-up, multi-angle living color view of my teeth.....I was appalled, embarrassed, and angry at the miserable-looking patch-up work my prior dentists had left me with.

Dr. Breziner, in his calm and patient manner, showed me various trouble spots, explained what was going on, and prioritized the care he would recommend.  He gave sound medical reasons for his recommendations, and addressed concerns my
previous dentist had dismissed.

For example, I had been led to believe that crowded lower teeth were just part of the aging process, that crowding happens to everyone.  I was willing at 45 years old to wear braces, but my then-dentist didn’t recommend it.  However, Dr. Breziner explained the problems that follow from the inability to floss and clean between crowded teeth, including infections, bone deterioration, etc.

For the past 7 plus years, Dr. Breziner has always been thorough in explaining what he sees and recommends, what we should watch out for, and what might happen if we don’t take action.

At 71 years old, my teeth are straight, my gums are healthier than they’ve been in 40 years, and my smile is better than ever.  I have every confidence in the expertise, honesty and integrity of Dr. Breziner and his entire staff at La Jolla Family Smile Design.  They are caring, respectful, and responsive to phone calls.  They are accessible, and address any concerns quickly and thoroughly.  I trust them and confidently recommend them.<//text>< Pics>

Dr. Breziner and all the staff at La Jolla Family Smile Design are the best, my husband and I totally recommend this place! They are all so professional and their customer service is excellent.
I had been trying to fix my teeth with Invisalign 2 times in the past with different dentists and I had never been satisfied with the end result until I found Dr. Breziner. I’ve finished my treatment and I love the result.</Review>

Services are great. For the most part good people, but after time I stopped trusting their billing and pricing. Accounting practices need to change as you will get bills down the road much higher than what was initially told. I also negotiated one large cost I am thinking about doing down so significantly over the phone that I wondered what else I had been paying too much on.</Text>

Great staff and great service! I did my Invisalign here, which was a success and surprisingly painless compared to normal braces. At the end of my regular Invisalign trays I wasn't super satisfied with the outcome, which isn't their fault cuz teeth movement can be unpredictable; I talked to the staff and they were able to quickly order me more trays and a follow-up plan. At the end of these trays I was perfectly satisfied. Would recommend!
They also validate parking for the entire day, not saying you should abuse it but you should totally check out the cute shop at La Jolla Cove while you're there ;)</Text>

<text>TL;DR - Amazing staff, amazing quality of work, just awesome!

I ended up at La Jolla Family Smile Design after another dentist botched a crown. A friend referred me and when I walked through the door, I knew I was in the right place.

Firstly, the front desk staff was very nice and friendly upon check in. Once taken back for my initial exam and cleaning, I settled into a comfy chair in front of a big window that looked out on La Jolla. Instantly comfortable.

The cleaning and exam began, my hygienist was friendly and not too talkative, which I appreciated.

Ok, so here's where I really noticed a big difference from every other practice I've been to. As my hygienist is working on my teeth, ANOTHER dental assistant (please forgive me for using the wrong title if I am) stopped in to ask my hygienist if she needed anything. I was floored. I think that they have a "floater" staff member who visits all of the areas to make sure everything is running smoothly.

I then had my meeting with Dr. Breziner. He is the consummate professional. His calm demeanor immediately put me at ease. He walked me through the process of how they were going to fixed my botched crown (again the botched crown was from another dental office) and I would be receiving a dental implant. He said it would take about a year.

Throughout the process, I had a very positive with Dr. Fern, the oral surgeon who did the majority of the work on my implant. He is fun and kept things light hearted during the process.

Over the course of this nearly year long experience, I visited La Jolla Family Smile Design about 6 times. EVERY TIME, I was treated professionally and I felt as though my time was valued. Their billing department worked with me to help get some coverage on the tooth, because insurance companies typically do not allow you to bill on the same tooth...anyhow, the billing department's hard work helped me save about $1000.

Well here we are at the end of the process. It takes close to a year for the whole dental implant process to be completed. Today I was fitted with my permanent dental implant. It fits perfectly. I have my smile back!

Thank you to the entire staff at La Jolla Family Smile Design, you went above and beyond to make sure that I was informed, the timeline was met, and that the service was amazing!!!!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Review>Outstanding service.  I could not be happier with the treatment from R&B.  My wife and I have been patients there for about 6 years now and have really gotten to know a number of the professionals in the office.  It's a great environment and we have always received top notch service.

Highly recommended.< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating><Gmap_id>0x80dc03fcc3f6aa01:0xc52de0d9e26a43d0< /Gmap_id>< pictures>

<user_name>Monica Hodes< /user_name><text>I've been going to La Jolla Family Smile and Design for about a couple years now. The biggest impression you get when you walk in the door is professionalism and friendliness. From the front desk staff to the dental hygienists, everyone is easy to talk to and easy to joke around with (if that's your style.) The office is modern and comfortable and they had much more modernized equipment than my previous dentist, so it
makes cleanings more efficient and quicker. I also started an Invisalign treatment when I first started going here, and I appreciated that Dr. Breziner really explained how it would help me. I was less concerned about the cosmetic aspect, but he explained how aligning my bite correctly would be an investment in my future oral health, decreasing the risk of chipping and breaking teeth by stabilizing my alignment. He came at me with science, and I was convinced! My Invisalign treatment has been pretty tricky with my teeth positioning, but I get regular checks to make sure things are moving as they should. And when it looked like my teeth were getting off track, Dr. Breziner scanned them again and adjusted my plan to something that would work better. The Invisalign treatment and technology are really amazing, you see on a personalized video just how your teeth will move and what the end result will be, which is really motivating. But the most encouraging thing is that Dr. Breziner and Diana constantly cheer me on, listen to my concerns and tell me I'm doing a good job. They seem genuinely interested in my progress and proud of their work. And seeing the way my whole smile has completely changed is proof of what a difference this treatment can make. It WORKS! When you go through the Invisalign process, in the beginning you're going to the dentist more than you're used to, so you'd better make sure you like the people there! I couldn't be happier with everyone at La Jolla Family Smile and Design -- I even recommended my husband go there for his Invisalign treatment. I'll be happy when I'm done with Invisalign, but a little sad to see these great people only for cleanings! But mostly happy, ha ha! Thanks for being on my teeth team, you guys are awesome!</text>< Gmap_id>

I can't stress enough how much I enjoy walking into this place, greeted, given exceptional work on my teeth, and taken care of like I was part of their extended family.  There's many places I'm sure you can get good business along with a great price.  What puts LJFSD on the top of my list is not only have I found a place that takes care of me, it comes with the feeling and sense of belonging. They make a point to treat you as such.  You have to experience it for yourself.< /text>

Fantastic staff and a bight clean office. I feel comfortable and relaxed while I am there  which is unusual for me at the Dentist. Trina, my hygienist, gives me a through cleaning as well as friendly advice on how to improve my oral hygiene.

They also work with me to maximize the costs paid by my insurance.< /review>

I have had a variety of procedures that include teeth cleaning, veneers, crowns, invisalign and my most recent recommendation, a snore guard.  I always feel that I'm treated with great care and concern and I have never felt that something was being recommended to me that wasn't in my best interest.

I actually look forward to getting my teeth cleaned so I may see everyone at La Jolla Family Smile Design.  Dr. B is such a nice person - he really cares about his patients.  When my 18 month old son chipped his tooth, we called Dr. B in the middle of the night and he returned our call and helped my son!  We will always be grateful to Dr. B for his guidance during that stressful dental emergency.  Both me and my husband have used Dr. B for our Invisalign treatment and could not be happier with the results.

My family has been going to Dr. Breziner for about 10 years on the recommendation of a friend.  The hygientists are excellent and give helpful instructions on improving the health of our teeth.  As a result, we have had very little need of dental work.  The work Dr. Breziner has done has been excellent and comfortable.  We have also had teeth whitening done at the office with great results.  The office is a pleasure, the communication easy, and my appointments have always been on time.
I highly recommend La Jolla Smile Design.< /review>

<Review>In 2016, by way of a referral from my colleague, I agreed to make La Jolla Family Smile Design my primary dentist. After a few general maintenance visits with Dr. B. we decided on the best possible option for me; the bonding procedure and few veneers. This past November I had the pleasure of completing that dental procedure! I remember being a bit nervous about the whole thing and what the outcome would be, both physically and mentally. For years, I had a complex about the gaps in my teeth, the different sizes and how it created a smile that I wasn't 100% happy with, but Dr. B. and his entire team made me feel very comfortable and most of all confident about the outcome! - and Boy oh Boy, did they DELIVER!!  At the end of the procedure, I couldn't have been more happier! My smile is what I dreamed it would be and now I have that extra boost of confidence when I talk to people and definitely when I'm laughing and smiling ( I do a lot MORE of that Nowadays!).  No more covering my laugh when something is funny! So to Dr. B., Mayra, Trina, Olie, Westin and the entire team at La Jolla Family Smile, Thank you THANK YOU! THANK YOU!! I will definitely be recommending anyone I hear who is the market for a new dentist home and in the meantime, I will be smiling BIG  as I roll into 2017!! Happy New Year Guys!!!< /Review>< pictures>

I hate admitting this but it had been 5+ years since I had been to a dentist or carried dental insurance prior to visiting Dr. Breziner.  I knew I needed work done and after my initial screening was confident I found a team that would bring me back to great dental health.  The office staff, dental hygienists and Dr. Breziner have all provided stellar service every step of the way.  From appointment bookings, explaining how insurance works, cleaning, examinations, cavities and crown - my experience has been better than I imagined any dental experience could be.  I'm so relieved to have found this office and now look forward to regularly schedule my 6 month checkups.  I've already had my 2nd follow up with positive feedback and no cavities!<//review>

This is actually a several month's old post that apparently I didn't actually post.  Everything went perfectly.  I was greeted warmly and taken directly to Joanne, the dental hygienist, who walked through the new steps for avoiding any contamination leading to giving or getting COVID-19.  She was perfect in showing me details in my x-rays which I really appreciated, and then, she cleaned and polished my teeth painlessly and yet, thoroughly.  Next, Dr. Romanowsky examined my teeth and relieved some anxiety I was having with intermittent soreness.  He used the panoramic x-ray machine to show me that there was nothing related to my teeth that would be causing this.  Finally, Olie showed me how I could benefit dramatically with their program for people like me who don't have dental insurance.  I left VERY happy!  Thanks to one and all!!  ~~Vance Baker<//review>

<Review>I’ve seen a lot of dentists in the past 10 years and I have to say that Dr. Jaime Breziner and the staff at R&B La Jolla Family Smile Design have done an amazing job with treating my teeth.

Dr. Breziner will explain everything to you before he takes any action. He’s extremely knowledgeable and patient. His work speaks for itself. I’m extremely happy with the way he treated me.

I have recommended Dr. Breziner to many people in San Diego and will continue to do so.

Thanks a lot!< /Review>< userid>

At La Jolla Family Smile Design, I have had the best experience in my life having to deal with my teeth . A whole new smile is always in my face, I had a couple of implants done plus the Invisalign that truly shows.
Now I only go every 4 months for an easy regular cleaning, and feel at home with the staff and Drs. Breziner and Romanovsky</Text>

< Review>
La Jolla Family Smile and Design has been my dentist since August of 2014.  On May 27, 2016, I completed a journey that started in January 2016 with the removal of my last baby tooth.  Dr. Fern, the oral surgeon, did an excellent, painless procedure with my tooth extraction and post implant.  Once the healing was complete, we did molds for my crown and while waiting for that, I had my teeth whitened.  Last Friday, Dr. Breziner installed my crown and I had my quarterly cleaning with my dental hygienist, Darlene.  I have had periodontal diseases for a few years and with quarterly visits, Dr. Breziner, and his staff has been able to stop the progress.  My teeth, gums, and mouth feel great and I actually look forward to my visits to the dentist.  From the administrative staff of Mayra, Olie, and Weston to my dental hygienist, Darlene who did a fabulous job replacing Trina, who left for maternity leave, to Dr. Breziner and his Dental Assistants, La Jolla Family Smile and Design treat you like family.< /Review>

<text>I am delighted to write a review for La Jolla Family Smile Design.  I have been a patient of Dr. Jaime Breziner's for about 6 years.  In that time, I have received routine examinations and cleanings, occasional fillings and one crown,  and have also received orthodontic treatment with Invisalign.  In all cases, the services and treatments I've received at La Jolla Family Smile Design have been outstanding.  I have recommended them highly to family, friends, and newcomers to our community.  La Jolla Family Smile Design combines excellent, expert dentistry with warm professionalism in all aspects of their practice, from the front office, to the dental hygienists and assistants, and to both Drs. Breziner and Romanowsky.  I look forward to continuing as their patient for many years to come.<//text>< pics>

<text>I could not recommend La Jolla Family Smile Design more.

Ten months ago I was new to the area and needed to find a dentist because I wanted to get Invisalign done. After thoroughly researching numerous dentist offices I decided on this practice due to its excellent reviews.  Although I had extremely high expectations going in, Dr.Breziner and his staff absolutely exceeded those expectations.

Dental expertise and knowledge aside, the thing that stood out to me the most was an underlying sense of honesty.  Through out my Invisalign procedure I had absolute confidence in Dr.Breziner and his incredibly competent staff. I was told the price of the treatment at the beginning and there were no extra hidden costs. Everything was explained to me clearly and the staff were more than happy to answer all of my many questions!

Each and every staff member went above and beyond to help in any way. Dr.Breziner said my Invisalign treatment would be finished in ten months and that is exactly when it finished. After the treatment I decided to get my front two teeth evened out as they were slightly chipped. I am very particular about my teeth  so as usual I had multiple questions that were all answered in a professional manner that was still easy for me to understand.

After I decided that I wanted to get my front two teeth evened out I considered getting two other teeth evened out. Although this would have been double the price, Dr.Breziner told me that he didn't think that it would look better and recommended against it. I really appreciated his honest opinion. As usual he went the extra mile and even put a temporary attachment on all four teeth so that I could see what it looked like. His professional opinion was spot on as usual.

I recommend Invisalign to everyone who is not 100% happy with their teeth. To be completely honest you don't notice wearing them at all after about the  week. In the beginning I was convinced that everyone could see them but not one single person noticed.

My teeth look absolutely fantastic. They look far better than I could have imagined and I am delighted that I now have nice teeth forever :D< /text>< user_id>

I've been an ongoing patient of Dr. Breziner and Dr. Romanowski's office  since 2003 and I have nothing but praise for them and their staff.  It is a professional atmosphere and at the same time they make you feel right at home, it's like family with how polite they are and the smiles  that they all greet you with when you walk in the door.  Not to mention the work they do, phenomenal!!  Carmen does a great job on my teeth, gums, etc and when I walk out of there I feel so thankful to have found a great dental office.  These days its not so easy to find a dental office that truely cares and that is why I always try and refer anyone I know to try them and see it for themselves.  I don't say this enough but Thank You Dr. Breziner and staff for all that you've done to keep my smile looking great!!<//Text>

I am glad to know Dr. Breziner and his team and I would like to share my case. I have always been self conscious about my teeth and smile because I had a bad overbite. As a result, I went the cheap route and went to Tijuana for a consultation in which she would come over to my house to check the progress. It was a couple years of treatment when I had braces, as the treatment was coming along she removed a couple teeth because according to her it had to be done to have more space. Unfortunately, months went by and she had dropped contact with me and she never showed up again. I then went to Western Dental and they removed the braces she had put on and the orthodontist told me that they couldn't do anything because they were not sure if the roots of my top teeth were damaged. They were saying that if they put the braces on, that my teeth could literally fall out. As a result, I had to stay the way I was which was worse because now my teeth had pretty big spaces between the teeth and the only thing to do was to just dream of one day where I can just smile without having to hide it. I would try not to laugh and speak much because I was really embarrassed of my teeth. That all changed when I met Dr. Breziner in 2015. I am currently on the Invisalign treatment, and from my very first visit at the office, I was made to feel welcomed and comfortable both by the friendly and amazing staff. and the pleasant environment of the office itself. I can honestly say that when it is time for me to go back that I just can't wait. I feel like a new me, I look different and most importantly I just can't stop smiling with my new teeth. I am really grateful and appreciative of Dr. Breziner and his team. You guys are awesome! I am happy that I could share my experiences with Dr. Breziner and his team at La Jolla Family Smile Design. Stop by, this place rocks!</text>

Both my wife and I were incorrectly billed by this company. They attempted to bait and switch both of us for unnecessary services, and billed our insurance far more than they originally stated in their estimate of services.  When asked for receipts/evidence of billing their representative was unable to provide any justification. This is a dishonest company, and I highly recommend you go for care somewhere else.</review>

I will make it a point to always come to this location because of Angel, manager, he’s super professional and has that “I can help” attitude. Thank you for the experience!

By the way the food was delicious. The amount that is given is more than enough and such a good price. Definitely recommend the Panini chain, especially this location! Thank you again Century City Team!<//text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

This is my favorite spot. Their chicken kabob and Kobideh (ground beef) are delicious. I usually order family combo with Roman avocado salad which is more than enough for two of us.< /review>

<Review>Terrible service and poorly managed location. It took us over 35 minutes to get our food (to-go) and this location does not maintain COVID distancing. People were all around everywhere and standing apart is not enforced. Food tastes okay but portion sizes are sufficient.<//Review>< GmapID>

<Text>Even then all the tables were occupied. The service was faultless and the degustation menu was beautifully presented and delicious. We all had the degustation menu but each of the diners’ allergies were catered for with excellent alternatives. One can see why they have 3 stars and they certainly deserve the accolade. The owner and chef came out to greet us towards the end of our meal. The restaurant was a fitting culmination to an excellent gourmet experience in Los Angeles, and we will definitely be back. It was such an amazing experience that we will remember for a very long time.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><date>1602607923942< /date><rating>5< /rating>< name>

<Text>They don’t serve paninis or wraps even though Panini is in the name. Extremely disappointed and will not be returning. If they bring back the paninis do give them a taste as they were by far the best thing on the menu.< /Text><UserId.>109342722671330075604<//UserId.>< name>

It was a lot of food and for a great price. This place is kind of hidden in the mall, so I wouldn't have found it without the suggestion of my coworker but I'm so glad she told me about it! They have a cute outdoor patio for you to sit at and the servers were very sweet.</review>< Pics>

Hidden gem in this big fancy mall.

My coworker suggested this spot today and I was very please with the food and was plenty left over of the pita bread, white rice and the hummus. The order came with two half chickens and free refills. All together price was $28 and some change. Overall great experience.</Review>

<date>1582418395193< /date><Rate>2< /Rate><review>Just okay. I got the pesto chicken panini with pasta salad. The salad had sliced tomato that wasn’t sliced all the way through so it was just a big hunk in the salad. The pasta was dry and hard in places. My sandwich was mediocre and not very flavorful. I didn’t taste any of the sundried tomatoes. I had fresh squeezed orange juice to drink that didn’t taste like it was fresh. Grocery store orange juice tastes better. The service was not very friendly. Just the bare minimum of politeness and zero attempt to be personable by any of the staff. I think most people in that mall are like that though. Very snooty.
A weird side note, we ate inside against the glass wall that separates inside from outside. But outside there was a table right next to ours. To me it was odd to sit that close to strangers. I had to actively try and not watch them.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMljut8cWu7Tz2lIMxeCk3lpHbmSkmukFU2Dz6L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2GBoVpA10Zomw0aC94hvOhmqNcZBNza7fRmiR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO39daPB_04GylyuDAR58ajz6B_jXAmK8nLDLUS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

I work in the area and I come here pretty often.
I give this place 3 starts not because of the food ( food quality is very good compared to the price ) but because of the service.
I don't understand what is going on with this place: some days service is excellent, some others (most of the time) is way too slow.
It happened more than once that we had to wait almost 10 minutes just to get water (after asking at least twice to the waiter) or as soon as they serve you they disappear and you have to chase them down if you need anything or ask for the check.
I like this place but they should do something to improve the service.<//text>

Oh my god! Portions are huge but you can take it away. Tasty and nice atmosphere but service gets a bit slow when the place gets crowded. Still I give it 5 stars!</text>

Updated Nov 24, 2017

My partner and i really love the food from this restaurant. When i say love yeah we’re huge fans and have been here many times for exactly the same order (chicken kabob and med rare flat iron kabob). Why i gave 1 star? It’s because last time we visited this restaurant we got terrible service by a server named Angel C. From the time he took the order he already showed us his ugly attitude without saying hi and even he asked my partner to hand the menu to him with his finger. The food was delivered and suddenly he was MIA. Our drinks were empty so we need a refill but it was so hard to get his attention since he never came back to check out our table. After a while finally we got him to bring us more drink but surprisingly the way he put our drinks on our table was totally unacceptable. It was like he slammed our drinks intentionally. I’m sorry to say i only tipped him 10% and that’s actually too much for his terrible service. I believe everyone has personal problem or experience bad day but please be professional especially in work environment. If you don’t like your job...just quit!!!

Previous review:

This restaurant is located in the corner far from dining area. While i was walking around the mall, I saw a crowd of people lining up during lunch time so i thought they must have good food. A few days later, i went to eat here with my partner. We ordered chicken shish kabob and medium rare flat iron kabob, we loved both of them. The meats were tasty and juicy plus the portion was pretty generous with basmati rice and salad. The food was not expensive for the amount we got. A glass of beer was around $5 and peach iced tea was $3. You'll get cash back from Yelp if you sign up your card. Service was friendly and attentive since they kept checking out our table and my iced tea was never empty. Overall, we love this place and definitely will be back soon.<//text>

As someone who works in the neighborhood, I have a love/hate relationship with Panini's. I love Panini's Hash (and some of the other breakfast dishes), though sometimes the service is slow while other times the food is undercooked. Stick with breakfast items and you'll be ok.< /Text>

Delicious Mediterranean food with great choices for appetizers and big portions for entrees. The service can be slow at times but that's because the location is usually busy. With that in mind you might have to wait a little to be seated. Otherwise, the service is great and it would be hard to be disappointed by the food.<//Review>

Love their food, generous portions and price is reasonable.  I recommend the Charbroiled Chicken Shish Kabob with Bulgar Pilaf, and Romaine Avocado Salad.  Request extra juicy chicken so it is tender.  Minus 1 star for above average noisy atmosphere and crowded seating.  Otherwise, I give it 5 stars.</Review>

Very delicious and servers are nice too!
One of my favorite panini kabob grill.
Food are very well made. Plates and other stuff are clean. They validate your parking tickets as well. Maybe 90minutes? I felt it was little short but better than nothing I guess.
Servers were nice not like the one in Beverly Hills.
I’m sure I’ll visit again.< /Text>

<text>Good fresh basic food for a reasonable price.  Salmon kabobs are fresh and are complemented by basmati rice, salad and gently grilled onions. I got a side of hummus to add some zest.  If the salmon came with a choice of sauce to top it I would likely give 5 stars but since it does not, it gets one star less because it is a bit bland- IT SHOULD COME WITH SOME GOOD SAUCE! Also, the service was lacking a bit (no automatic ice tea refills) and the single unisex restroom outside required a long wait. That said, I liked the full experience enough to want to return.</text>< user_name>

I just ordered the salmon salad and lentil soup from here and everything was well worth what I paid. They followed my directions to hold the cheese and olives, and the order came with pita bread and utensils. There was actually a good amount of salmon and it tasted delicious!< /review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>We used to go to the location in Westwood. This new location offers more seating, but large groups need to come early to hold a table.

The food is delicious as always and the serving sizes are generous. Our group of 8 ordered several entrees and 3 of us split the family meal that included 3 skewers, rice, and 2 salads. The family meal could have easily fed 4-5 people. We ended up with enough leftovers for all of us to bring for lunch the next day.</Text>< pictures>

<text>Ordered a shish chicken kebab through postmates and was disappointed. For $12.99 they gave me a tiny amount of rice, 6 tiny pieces of chicken and two onions. The chicken is okay I guess but the plate is literally half empty. Salad was whatever, it was three croutons and a bunch of really dry lettuce. Will not ever be ordering anything from this place again, reviews were very misleading<//text></record></dataset><record>

Revised down a star 12/9/17: two people took my drink order and nothing after 15 minutes, having to wait in line to remind them. I’d understand if they were busy, but they weren’t at all. Again, disappointing because the food is good, but service is still lacking :///

Original 3 star review: Firstly, the food is very good.

What I have a problem with is that the first time I came it was very early in the day, no customers, and the amount of food that I received was very generous.

The second time I came was around 1 PM, and evidently still in the middle of lunch rush. The amount of chicken that I received was about half of what I received last time for the same meal. Same with the amount of avocado on the salad.

What gives? Do you portion based on demand?<//text>

Pretty good Mediterranean food. The hummus and kebabs are good. The portions are huge, so don't over order! Always crowded, but the wait is usually shot as they have so many tables.</Review>

Pleasing small and large plate Mediterranean food. Chairs and wall benches a little severe but the staff  did everything to please my elderly aunt but hand feed her.  They would patent their excellent training program!.</Review>

<Review>I came here with my friends for dinner. My friend recommended this place for their good quality meats. It is in the Westfield Century City mall in the first level. There is seating outside and inside. There was no wait time which was good and the hostess sat us right away. The place is clean and there’s ample room for big groups. Our server was good and didn’t rush us to order. It was my first time here and there were a lot of appetizing dishes. We ordered the appetizer combo platter which includes the most popular appetizers. It comes with hummus trio, pita bread, tzatziki, falafel, and caprese. The appetizer was delicious and there’s enough food to share among 4 people.

I ordered the chicken wrap which has chicken, hummus spread, tomato, cucumber, pickles, and lettuce. You get the choice of ordering either a soup or salad. I ordered the romaine avocado salad and it comes dressed in a lime vinaigrette dressing. The dressing was tasty and tangy with the hint of lime and oils. The wrap is huge and I couldn’t finish the other half. The chicken was juicy and not hard or dry. You get a lot of food and it’s very filling. I wish they would open more locations closer to where I live. The food is delicious and I will come back to try the other dishes.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb8b88b39c21:0xd7e05b31c10d27e9< /Gmap_id></record>

I ate here for the first time tonight and was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the chicken Kabob and my wife enjoyed the shrimp Kabob. Along with the Kabobs the meals come with a few choices of salads and rice. As an appetizer we had the the combo hummus plate (for the price we felt it was on the small side). Considering it was all fresh and hot we will be back for more.<//Review>

Well let's see.  I ordered to go through eat24 and I asked the guy on the phone is it OK if he sends somebody by the door to give me the food due to lack of parking space.  At first he said sure.  Then when I called back again he says I'm sorry we can't take food outside.  I told him I'm right outside he says no. "Sorry sorry that's against our policy " food was horrible.  Meat stunk . Rice was fried rice.  Oh and the best part.  Geniuses forgot to put fork and spoon in the bag. I mean true geniuses work in this place.  Especially the cashier the biggest genius of all. Waste of $21.96 . Do Not Make my mistake.< /review>

The employees are not well trained. They forget right away what you ask for. Also, they do not look at customers when they walk by. When you raise your hand to call the employees, it is very hard because they do not look at you. They are very unorganized.</text>

Went for breakfast there on a weekday. It seemed like no one was fully awake at 9am. It took 40 minutes to get 3 of the 4 orders and a message from manager that they didn't have the croissant for the 4th order (Ham, egg, and cheese croissant sandwich) . They did offer a free meal as compensation but I didn't take it fearing another 40-minute wait.< /text>

<Text>This is a new location, they've been open for 3 months. I would think that with several other successful locations there wouldn't be a learning curve with a new place but . . .

I don't know if I will return to this location. I love the Glendale location. The area, staff, ambience and food is much better.

First it is in the Century City Mall. Pretty cool, huh? Nope. It is in the Bloomingdales wing next to an elevator and a cement wall. No view. Nothing to look at. Kind of dreary.

Appetizer combo platter was sorely lacking. In Glendale the plate is covered with 3 kinds of hummus, falafel, caprese, salad and some pita. The food was overflowing the plate and you could just eat that and be full. Here not so much. Hummus was ok. The black bean one is not great. 3 little falafel balls, and 2 caprese stacks. And a lot of plate in between. The pesto on the caprese stacks was outstanding.

Entrees
Beef koubideh kabob was excellent with fluffy, tasty rice. The salad was un-eatable. I hate wilted gross mixed greens. Yuck!

Salmon and Brie panini was quite good. Imagine a bagel with locks but on a panini.

Tuna melt panini was really good. The balsamic glaze made the sandwich. The greens and red onions make it a stand out. It is also hearty enough to take 1/2 to go for later. It didn't get soggy.

There was a stern man, looked like he may be a manager hanging out talking to the employees one by one. No interaction with any costumers.

My husband ordered a hot tea and they give you a choice of several different kinds. But no sugar cubes ???? How could you serve a tea at a Mediterranean Persian leaning restaurant without a little something sweet? And I don't mean dessert. A couple of sugar cubes, or a zoolbia (like in Glendale). Not a good way to end a mean of kabob and rice.

I almost forgot the best most unexpected thing they have there! Baklava with ice cream !!! 2 triangles of Hot baklava with vanilla bean ice cream. I don't really care for baklava I could usually take it or leave it. But this hot baklava with ice cream is something else !

As I look at the pictures, maybe the plates are too big. Especially for the appetizer and dessert.

I will give it a little time before I come back to this location. I hope it improves because I do love Panini Grill and Kabob's other locations and I do love the Century City Mall< /Text>< user_id>

My order was placed on delivery service 9:35
I was told it would be delivered in 25 min.
Hour 45min later I called to check on this order and the RUDE woman on the phone gave me lame excuse after lame excuse and tried to blame the drivers. Never ordering from this place AGAIN.< /Review>

<review>I didn't realize this is a chain.  It has a really nice, neighborly atmosphere to it.  This is one of their new locations in the Century City Mall.

There is an ample seating area with some outside as well.

Their literature claims the food is fresh, healthy, with no additives and that's just how it tasted.  My Mousakka was excellent with ground sirloin and marinara sauce.  The lentil soup was very hearty and flavorful.

I also had their hummus plate with edamame and bean dips which was fresh and delicious.

The salmon cream cheese dill panini was also a standout.

Service by Mario and Lenena was excellent and fast.

This is the best middle eastern chain I have been to so far this year in southern cal; so I am looking to try out their other locations.<//review>< rating>

The restaurant recently brought back their falafel which ties with Bella Pita for best falafel in the area. A great variety on each dish; rice, salad, humus, yogurt dip, a pickle, and pita bread on the falafel dish. Other vegetarian options include a tofu kabob with fresh veggies and a delicious seasoning. Large portion sizes. Great prices. Somewhat plain avocado salad so don't choose that option. Terrific service and an awesome atmosphere (which includes heated, outdoor seating).</text>

<review>Dolmades was interesting, but not too my tastes. The panini we ordered was cold, and the cheese want melted, although the ingredients were fine. Previously the paninis were hot, so possibly a one time issue. The chicken kebab was worth it. Panini asides portion sizes are very generous.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

<userid>109491235478776549527</userid><Review>The decorations and music rest upon a Mediterranean theme, and are pretty good. Food is okay if I stick with regulars like hummus & pita and caesar salad. The service, however, has been declining every time I return. No table has a designated server; their attention is diverted to tendering take-outs and welcoming new guests. It takes an unreasonable amount of time to have the water refilled, or to get the check, with my student discount dishonored. Today I was waitlisted even though unoccupied tables were in sight. As I waited a man elbowed past me. Suddenly he returned and asked, with a threatening glare, why I hadn't stepped away and let him in. I turned and walked away as fast I as could; under my pounding heart were two words: never again.<//Review><time>1412134469088</time><rate>2< /rate>< response>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>Great lunch choice if you are craving either Italian or Mediterran cuisine. You really do get the best of both worlds. I also come for the medi cuisine, and have yet to be disappointed.

You can’t go wrong with charbroiled tofu kabob. I recommend getting a little adventurous and going for the tofu kabobs served with hummus, organic wheat pilaf and the avocado salad….YUM. The tofu is firm and seasoned perfectly that you have no choice but to fall in love. Above all else it’s reasonably priced ($9.95) and a large food portion, which makes this an excellent lunch option. Also UCLA students and employees get a 20% off discount…SCORE!

Another great vegetarian option is the falafel wrap which I got with the avocado salad. The falafels here aren’t crunch but really soft. It’s delish nonetheless and very filling.

During lunch it does get very crowded so it’s best to pick up or plan ahead to be out the office for a while. It’s certainly worth a visit!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2bb8b88b39c21:0xd7e05b31c10d27e9< /gmap_id></record>

<review>This lunch spot is yummy!! I am a big fan of the kebabs, both the chicken and the Koobideh (ground sirloin). They also come with grilled veggies, a side of rice and choice of salad (caesar, mediterranean greek or romaine avocado).

I usually get take out but have eaten in a few times and had great service. I've also ordered catering for our office and it was a huge hit. The only negative is that they are a a very busy spot and so sometimes it is hard to get a hold of them if you are calling for take out or catering during the lunch rush. Try to call well in advance for big orders.< /review><Response>None<//Response>< rating>

Unbelievable service, such a treasure.  George handles his people and his customers with ease, grace and humor.  I always come away from MBZ knowing I can trust the results.  Not many mechanics like these guys!

I'll keep coming back</Text>

The Very Best autorepair shop for your MBZ. I've been going here for years, the service is impeccable, there is no extra over pricing ever.  I even bought another MBZ from the owner George. You can't find a better establishment.< /review>

This place is always on point. The staff are efficient, professional, and reasonable as far as pricing and the actual work that needs to be done. This place is busy, but that's because they provide excellent service and have a lot of returning customers. It's definitely worth the wait. Great work Mbz Motors.<//review>

Police incident. Had to call a detective after a crooked towing company stole my vehicle and dropped it off here. Then they refused to release the car. The auto detective knew what they were up to and ordered them to pull out all employee papers knowing there was illegal activity going on. They released my car with no charge. ALL of the employees gave me and my wife a filthy look as if they were caught and exposed.< /Text>

<text>George has been fixing my cars for 12 years and I can't say enough good things about him and his staff. He kept my car running while I was in school and provided a ride to school, or a ride home. He dropped his cost of oil change to reflect the drop in national cost of oil. Who does that?! George. Quality service. And he knows his customers well; notices when I'm not feeling well and tells me not to worry and get well. He's not cheap, but he is reasonable and you can be damned sure he's going to fix the problem and a few others that he may not even tell you about.  Love him dearly.</text><Name>Shirley Harding</Name><userid>114133257665076564000<//userid>< Date>

I've been a loyal customer for 7 years. Even after moving to the Bay Area, I try to schedule my maintenance and repairs during trips to see family and friends in LA.  An honest mechanic is hard to find.  George is a keeper.<//review>

One of the Best Mercedes Shop in town, don’t be surprise if you find no space because everyone want a touch from George.. The quality of service is incomparable for the price on a MB... I’ve been going to this place for 4 years, I never been disappointed with the quality of the service or the price. MBZ Motors, thank a lot for your service.<//Text>

My S550 had a clunking sound when driving over small imperfections on the road and it was bugging me for months. My brother in law referred me to MBZ and boy was I thankful. George was patient with me and took his time to figure out the cause of the clunking. It’s was my left air strut. After this was replaced my car rides as smooth as butter. Also his pricing is extremely reasonable. My Benz will only be serviced by George moving forward. Thanks again George for taking the time and finding the root of my cars issue.< /text>

<Review>Mbz Motors does excellent work and very reasonable prices. Very customer service centric. Their prices are a fraction of the dealer's. A month ago I had to have my car towed to the dealer. A censor had gone bad. The dealer was going to charge $960. Mbz charged $380.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

If you have a Mercedes and live in the area - this is the place to go. I can barely get them to charge me anything. My tank cap was stuck, then a lightbulb needed to be replaced, but George just waves you off. When I had more costly repairs, I was charged, but much less than I expected - I am going nowhere else with my MBs (2001 SLK, 2014 CLA, 2007 GL) try them and judge for yourself.< /Text>

<text>I' am officially so impress by this company.
about 6-7 months ago they fix  brakes on my wife's  E-class. yesterday  you could hear a very loud noise coming from the brakes.,so my wife took  back the car  this morning not only they fix my brakes , they also replace a xenon  light that was busted.. basically they had a mechanic working on my Benz for over 1 hour and 30 minutes..

wonder how much did I end up paying? ZERO-NOTHING-NIET-NADA! you guys are pure awesomeness, classy place, classy people, and extremely professional way more professional & friendly then the MZB of encino !

i will always go back to this place for getting any kind of  service done to my automobiles<//text>< pictures>

<Review>George always looks out for me when I take my car in. Usually lets me know exactly what's going on with my car and what I need to do to fix a part etc. I've been taking my Mercedes to him since I bought the car and he makes sure to keep it running.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80c29b8f9d4554f7:0xb2246a0c70d3ae9d</Gmap_id></record>

We liked it, had a great brunch? and had no complaints. Beach front location, 6 options for brunch (very limited) and lots of drink choices. Friendly staff. Lots of indoor and outdoor seating (with nice heat lamps). Prices were actually reasonable for the amazing location.

Wow, what a fantastic time at JRDN restaurant!   My wife and I stayed at T23 and had the pleasure of eating in JRDN's restaurant a few times over the last couple of days.  Everyone from the fabulous hostesses to the Bartenders and servers were polite, professional, and smiling.   The food was absolutely amazing.  Special thanks to Sushi Chef Ray and the team for filling us with some of the best tasting Sushi we have ever experienced.  The food from presentation to taste was beyond our expectation and we can't wait to go back.

Thank you for making our stay so special, we are forever grateful and look forward to returning< /review>

Beautiful beachside spot for drinks and food. Expect all prices for drinks and food to be a little higher than normal but not bad considering the ambiance and location. Short stack pancakes for $10, an old fashioned for $14. Bartenders were all super nice.</Text>

Fantastic place to eat right on the beach! Great people and the service was worth more than the price of the food. The food was fantastic and even with the COVID and two weeks to the election, the atmosphere was relaxed and outgoing. We ate on the patio, but it was open to inside dining as well (although with much reduced seating). Oh, and good news. They took my temperature at the door and it would appear that I'm one cool customer.< /text>

Amazing!! The food was incredible. I had the açaí bowl and it was the best I’ve probably ever had... and I’ve had many. My mother had the ABC omelette and she loved it! Service and atmosphere were also great. Will definitely be back!!</Review>

We had lunch at this restaurant a few times while on the island visiting family and friends. The servers here are just wonderful and have great memories it seems. We sat on the oceanfront patio and enjoyed the view with our delicious wine and lunch. Must try!< /Review>

Amazing views and amazing food! Visited in Aug. 2020 at the peak of summer at 11am. Easily got a table along the boardwalk because not too many ppl dining yet. Had sushi, blackened salmon sandwich (⬅️ a MUST HAVE) and a steak salad... AMAZING! Drinks, hosts and servers were great, too! Great dining experience. Thank you, Jrdn!!< /review>

<text>Went there for Brunch. Food was good and very presentable. Staged very well on the plate for both visual appeal and to entice hunger.  All the brunch items looked delicious.  It's got a nice ocean view which is good to look at while eating.  My meal, which was the biscuits and gravy, was very satisfying.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHJIpHFWQJ1BNpF939pFnqh6b3phYzUL7TAGNm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqN7xMJyGXvrSpls4MIFvTy0ZEqmOtYXBbUDky=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNA8Rqx_v1lfzFvzS5Wrd_j3h41klnpPl8oJX2z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrI-4TyxnJFU-6IjvLFI6IQjySHlkwWCfrMNWc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dc018d4d55b7c7:0x47f19b304b8e84bc<//gmapID></record>

Love the tapas plates and scrumptious Pinot Noirs.  Atmosphere could not be better and the service is impeccable.   Even better, you can ride your bike to this place with stress free parking.   Love this place for a Pacific Beach date night!!!!< /Text>

Headed to the beach area on Sunday because the weather was beautiful in finest city.  I think everyone has the same idea!  Decided to have lunch at JRDN since it is on the beach with a lovely view.   Wait was not long and we were seated at a table with a gorgeous view of the ocean and the boardwalk. Our waitress, Mari was excellent. Although it was very busy, she was friendly and very attentive!< /text>

<Review>This is a good breakfast spot in Pacific Beach. It is part of the bottom floor of the Tower23 Hotel.

The upsides of the restaurant are that service is really good, the decorum and design is cool and relaxing, there is validated parking if you park in the Urban Outfitters lot next door, and you get a full view of the boardwalk and ocean.

In terms of the actual food, it is pretty good, but nothing to write home about. It's also just a tad overpriced. Don't get me wrong, the food is good and fresh, but it's basic and not totally worth the price tag. The slight price hike can be reasonably attributed to the decorum, service, and view though.

The photos attached to this review show a breakfast tea set up, the vegetarian scramble, and the avocado toast.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9fnZcX6aQ06AJo4HJ8WULzsJuGB7VIApqaMTf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDsN4SsdV5Gi0BUxGI6E98-rhYyg7c01F07H8a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOL0GNHV4ofaDK5S2BbpIGOJyXGwv_syL_6x86s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

Dinner was very nice tonite.  Members of our group had Mary’s chicken, lobster pasta, and salmon. Everything was good, and portions were generous. Service was okay - not over friendly, but fairly efficient. I suspect they are not eager to get those free refills going. A little pricey. Folks at the next table were digging into the $110 40 lb steak. Looked like a good choice.</review>

<Review>Cocktails with an ocean view. Went for a birthday lunch and sat outside. The sushi was just OK. Ordered 3 Rolls - The Rainbow Roll filling was dry. The Ahi Tuna Nachos were good though and the atmosphere is great. Views of Pier and water. The wait staff is very nice and our server was very considerate and brought us a birthday plate without my even asking! They had just changed their drink menu and the pink concoction was good. I would go again but no sushi for me.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>I can't even begin to describe the amazing meal we just had. Stacy our server was wonderful, she's also a photographer which helped when we asked her to take a couple photos. You can cut your steak with a knife, it's that tender. Oh and the halibut YUM! We will definitely be coming back. Thank you for making it a memorable evening for my family from Texas.</Text><Time>1542767719761<//Time>< user_name>

<response>None< /response><Text>Since the space available during Covid is limited to outside dining be prepared for a bit of a wait. They have a employee outside greeting you and taking temperatures before you are even allowed a step inside to speak with the hostess.
Tables are set proper distance apart and all staff are wearing face masks, so you are assured a safe dining experience.
Drinks were yummy and the food was creative and satisfying.

Amazing view! Perfect for the sunset!
Good service.
We ordered the Brussels and the Carrot Risotto...awesome!
Brussels were perfectly cooked.  Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.  Garlic and bleu cheese compliment them well.
Risotto was made with the whole carrot, perfectly cooked and full of flavor.
Had the La Pina on the cocktail list, it was just ok for me.  It was good, not very sweet and it came on the rocks.
Want to ho back and try the Panna Cotta!<//review>

We arrived for brunch around 11am and put our names down for a table on the patio (there was a 20-30 minute wait for the patio, but no wait for the dining room). We ordered mimosas from the bar while we waited. The bar staff were super friendly and provided quick service.

Once we were seated the service went a bit downhill. Our water didn't show up until after we were almost done with our food, and we had already gotten a second round of drinks.

That said, the food was great, and the Irish coffee I got with breakfast was very good.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOI09v4Z-bNeYCdyAjWI8h86tUUQtabFEiKNg2G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Loved the feel of this place. Felt very relaxed. We got the fried calamari for an appetizer. I got the lamb steak. It was delicious. I wanted to eat the meat off the bone. But, that wouldn't have been very classy in a place like this. For four of us our bill was right at $200 with drinks. Would come here again!< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dc018d4d55b7c7:0x47f19b304b8e84bc< /Gmap_id><rating>5< /rating>< Pictures>

Good food, drink and ambience. Nearly every dish on the menu was meat-centered. There was one plant-based main and one appetizer<//Review>

<Text>Just like how I rated it. Three stars. Nothing out of the ordinary other than the beach view. The food was good, but it didn't wow me. We ordered avocado toast and egg beendict. They were both good. We enjoyed the beach view a lot, but since it was gloomy and windy out we opted to sit inside. One of the down sides on dining in PB was the parking. It was extremely frustrating just to find a parking spot. On the bright side, our waitress, Heather, was exceptional! On a busy Memorial day, she came to check on us at least every 15 minutes!</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5zCdFc3KZULwBZaqggIk_NYCPLfASn1Uov3mX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWRhRPsuLmfxqm6Ew3LXJ696Y3CMgAWwr5IRDP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZqazL7XfaGdKlwP9dZQXZH0nH9Xvm5Ylnb0o8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjV_N1OiLOr1Dq1qQPCKEFqSMsSYTSk1SbmPRT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

Excellent location with beautiful views of Crystal Pier and north to La Jolla. Really enjoyed our brunch and the service was great. And with such limited parking in PB we'r really appreciated the 2 hours of parking validation!< /Review>

Just went for the second time. Last time indoors by the windows. This time outside. Both beautiful with ocean views. Food is delicious. More interesting sushi, great salads (I had grilled octopus), huge sandwiches (my husband has the lobster BLT for lunch and it basically was his dinner too.< /Text>

Staff also not particularly accomodating (we asked to change table they refused, the tables were all still constantly empty by the time we left).</Review>< Pictures>

Aug 2020: Perfect set-up on the patio for physical distancing. They check your temp when entering

We went on a Friday morning right when they open at 9am. Reggae music playing was the perfect vibe.

The boardwalk traffic wasn't jam packed; just enough for good people (PUPPY) watching. And the glass three-quarter wall provides a nice separation from all their germs.

I tried something new - veggie scramble. It was really, really good. I did ask for no tomatoes, but it came with tomatoes. Regardless so tasty, and they didn't skimp on avocado!

2019: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Great location & view.  I always enjoy the lobster BLT sandwich.  There is valet parking available off of the alley.  Service is good but not warm and friendly.like most beach businesses.  It's more trendy and upscale with service feeling a bit aloof.<//Text>

<user_name>Jay Keyes< /user_name><text>Although Pacific Beach restaurant JRDN is ostensibly trendy, it has now been operating in San Diego since 2006, so it clearly is no longer surviving on hype alone. The restaurant has re-invented itself this past winter with a modest remodel while bringing back chef David Warner who has since evolved the already Asian-heavy Southern Californian menu to feature even more Asian dishes. While I struggle to call JRDN "fine dining," it has retained an upscale vibe and, with all due disrespect to "World Famous," JRDN is the only restaurant where one can sip a craft cocktail while enjoying anything close to a high-quality meal on Pacific Beach's concrete boardwalk.

In case you were wondering (because I was), JRDN stands for "Jordan," which is the name of the hotel owner's son and also his father, and this is important because it helps us keep mindful that JRDN is a hotel restaurant. It does not need to cater to crude local tastes but rather its culinary team has more freedom to take avant-garde risks with its menu to serve well-off guests with more worldly dining needs. Tower 23 is a "luxury hotel" with rooms that start at north of $900 per night during summer months and thus will always require an on-premises high-end restaurant regardless if the locals reject it. This leaves Chef Warner with the ability and financial flexibility to do just about anything he wants. While this setup is the reason why many chi-chi hotel restaurants are overpriced and terrible, we should note that some of San Diego's very best and most enduring restaurants (Addison, Vivace, etc.) operate in this model, which is also the basis of Las Vegas's entire fine dining scene.

"Clams with Spaghetti" is the kind of pasta dish I cannot resist ordering when I see it on menus. Here at JRDN, their dish consisted of Pernod and charred fennel, which added an unusually heavy herbal and licoricey quality to this dish unlike any variation I've previously had. They threw in Chinese sausage (i.e., pork seasoned with "5 Spice") and tomatoes, and I was served a dish that hit the mark in terms of satisfying my hunger but left me scratching my head wondering what they were trying to achieve in terms of taste.

This is why I appreciate and prefer the straightforward mouth-watering richness of the buttery, garlicky chorizo cream sauce in JRDN's new "Steamed Mussels" dish. I could pick a day and do nothing but sit on JRDN's patio with a few loaves of bread and a bottomless supply of this sauce and die a happy man from heart failure at the end of it.

Similarly, the sushi dishes at JRDN have always been pretty good, especially their "Local Yellowtail" dish of hamachi soaking in sesame mirin, enhanced by jalapeños and garlic, served with crispy, salty taro chips - which is essentially a better version, in my opinion, of the same dish served at "Trust," whose chef used to work at JRDN. The "Nigiri" served to me across a few visits has been of sufficiently high quality, particularly their tako (octopus) which is often dry and tasteless elsewhere but has a perfect texture and pleasant flavor at JRDN.

I could write more about some of the items no longer on the menu, but I'll summarize by saying that this restaurant's range is "average to very good," with not many misses, but also not many particularly great dishes aside from the mussels. During each visit here, I always expect just a little bit better than what I get. Given the flexibility of his setup, I'd like to see Chef Warner play things a little less safe. That said, "safe" is more likely to create repeat customers. This is why, while not my first choice for dining out in San Diego, JRDN is always a reasonable option when I plan to be at Pacific Beach around lunch or dinner time.<//text>< Resp>

You've got to try the Time Waster.  I highly recommend you make reservations A-day in advance so you can get a table along the sea wall. They have outdoor heaters that makes the evening breezes comfortable when it's a bit chilly. You're going to love this place.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Breakfast was truly excellent. Try an omelette with farm fresh vegetables. Service was very attentive without being overbearing. And the view over the ocean just simply can't be beat. It's a great place to bring a date, a friend, or a business colleague.  There is music loud enough to provide a Vibe without distracting from your conversation.< /Text>

<review>A must hit if you're anywhere nearby!  I give out very few 5 stars and I've only reviewed a small percentage of all the places I've eaten in all over the world but this is a solid 5-star.  The Ahi Ahi tuna nachos is an incredible sharing / appetizer.  Really the best ahi nachos I've ever had and there are a few renditions out there....mangos, avocados, peppers, ahi tuna, the wonton "chips' and an incredible sauce with a little heat.  The combo is to die for. We also tried the fish tacos and the fish and chips.  Both well above average.  The tacos were a good 4.5.  Fish and chips were nice cuts of fish and the batter was 'light' (I'm assuming a beer batter heavy on the beer making it 'airy') and crisp.  Underwhelming but only because they were being compared directly to the other items I mentioned above.  But again above an average fish and chips, I'd go a 4 just because there's nothing unbelievable. And to finish we did the carrot cake.  Amazing if you're a fan of carrot cake...popcorn on it?!  Who would've thought of that?!  But what a great pairing.  4.5+  The service was perfect!  Great setting, location and vista.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtfDGBNfi3iqTjLE0ryksL85ks2S8UxHy3Nbai=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJhgvMw002_yPllsxSBEB1VobC3_VjJwoZOEMe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dc018d4d55b7c7:0x47f19b304b8e84bc<//Gmap_id></record>

If I could give no stars, I would. The food tasted good, but if you happen to find yourself in need of medical attention while at JRDN , you will not get help from most of the staff. My husband had a severe reaction to seafood while we were eating and passed out, though we were not aware of the cause at the time. We (my daughter) called 911 and a couple of other diners tried to assist but the staff was much less helpful. They were however concerned about the spectacle our medical emergency was causing. One employee told us to wait outside for the ambulance to arrive. At this point we had no idea if it was heart attack, stroke, or what. We remained in the restaurant, even though the staff moved my husband from his seat and had him walk, until the medics arrived, even though the employee would have preferred for us to get out, I will say, one employee with EMT training was concerned ( about my husband) and helpful. On our way to the hospital our server called our friend to inquire about paying our check before we’d even researched the ER in the ambulance we left the restaurant in. I called the next morning to pay our check and express my concern for the lack of assistance they showed, not to mention insensitivity, and the manager told me that it was handled wrong and he “shouldn’t have been moved” and should’ve been “made comfortable where he was” but did let me pay our check. They did subtract the lobster dish. Unconscionable service. The man who wanted us to ‘“wait outside” and the server who called us about the bill on the way to the hospital should be ashamed of themselves.< /text>

< review>
Just had a terrible experience at JRDN! Not handicapped friendly! I made reservations for my birthday,  went there expecting to spend $500 plus for drinks and dinner with my family.  The hostess tried to seat us in a passageway. The hostess was not accommodating wouldn't let us sit near heatlamp. Got blessed by seagull droppings on our person and food! They did replace  the items but still charged us- would have been a nice courtesy to comp the items. It was so miserable we left and went to another restaurant who accommodated us. The waitress was great and tried her best. The hostess sucked.< /review>

The sushi is good. The Tomahawk steak was great. Disappointed they were out of lobster but it was understandable because they had a wedding reception.< /Text>

<review>Nicest up-scale + on-boardwalk outside seated restaurant in PB.  Pricey menu but some really tasty items.  Good mimosas for brunch.  Probably best choice for corporate lunch or happy hr spot in Pb.  Free valet at the hotel for customers key for quick parking. (2 hrs I think)< /review><Rating>5< /Rating>< gmap_id>

My guest went into anaphylactic shock after eating a bite of his daughter’s lobster pasta dish. We were able to call 911 however the management forced my guest to walk out front and wait. The management seemed more concerned with the optics of the situation, than the well being of my friend. While on the way to the emergency room I received a call about paying our bill after being told not to worry right now. The JRDN staff and management could not have been more ridiculous and are lucky to not be talking to my attorney. These folks are complete novices and could use customer service and emergency training. If you want to eat somewhere where they care about you and not there bottom line, never dine at JRDN. A truly horrible experience. I will never dine at JRDN or recommend JRDN.</Review><gmapID>0x80dc018d4d55b7c7:0x47f19b304b8e84bc</gmapID></record>

Love everything! We shared the sliders as an app, shared the jordan 2.0 sushi roll, and I had the scallop entree. I can't say a single bad thing about it. And the service was great! Thanks Stacey! The atmosphere is very modern and there are plenty of colorful lights even though it is pretty dim.<//review>

<review>Our apartment building landlord has been giving us JRDN gift cards for years and we finally decided to use them up. The environment is very high class and the food was excellent. Although the prices are a bit high, the quality and taste of the food was amazing. My husband had the breakfast plate, my daughter had the kids burger, and I had the chicken sandwich. We were all very happy! The only downside is the lemonade was a bit too sour for my daughter's taste but the waitress was very happy to switch it out for her. I also appreciated that the waitress let my husband know that he may not enjoy replacing the pancake for the waffle, as the waffle is made more for the fried chicken and waffles plate, rather than being sweet. He would not have enjoyed that! Between the service, the quality of food, and the ambiance, I would have felt we would have gotten our money's worth even if we had not had gift cards. Highly recommend. They also do reservations and will validate your parking at the valet!</review>< Resp>

More upscale guess they call it(I'm from Vegas so) anyway pretty views. Pricey to match the restaurant thou class. Spouse had a nice presentation steak(dressed to impress) I opted for a simple side and cold beverage. Would recommend if your not on a budget.< /text>

Food was pretty good, had super slow service though. When we spoke with our server about it he just gave an excuse about how many people showed up after sunset - like this was the first sunset crowd the restaurant had ever seen. Nothing comped, nothing fixed.< /text>

We were there Sunday and back again today the burgers were so darn good.  Worth the extra dollars.

< Review>
It was a disappointing experience.  The service was slow.  The tuna on the menu was supposed to be rare, I ordered it seared & it was served well done.  We ordered bread, 15 minutes later they said that they didn't have any.  When I pointed out they have toast on their menu & asked what they used, the gal was confused & said she would have to check.  Suddenly we had 2 orders.  The check arrived very fast & when I pulled out my credit card they were extremely expeditious.  If they would only apply that level of service to taking the order, preparing & delivering it.  The food was good but nothing special.< /Review>

This place is hidden away in The Tower 23 hotel in PB.  It was awesome.  We tried almost every appetizer, including sushi.  We then ordered the carnitas as the main course.  It was enough for 5 people and we still had leftovers for home.  The carrot cake was very tasty.  The atmosphere was energetic and our server Sophia was the best.</Text>

<review>The views and atmosphere are unbeatable.  You can't get better than overlooking the Pacific Ocean right on the boardwalk.  The wait staff was very friendly and prompt.  Unfortunately, the food is a mixed bag.  Our appetizers where phenomenal; the steamed mussels and calamari were some of the best I've had in ages.  However, the dinner entrees were mediocre at best and way too expensive.  I paid $50 for an 8oz. steak, and it definitely was subpar.  Lunch was better.  The burger I had recently was good.  I'll definitely go back for drinks and appetizers to watch the sunset, but I'll avoid dinner next time.</review>< resp>

<Review>The view from the restaurant can't be beat as it's right on the ocean. The food was decent, though our service was spotty. I dined with a large group and the food came out very scattered. There was a lot of confusion from the JRDN staff as to who ordered what dishes and when an item came twice, the restaurant even charged us for both items. This felt sleazy, especially after we talked with the staff about it and they refused to remove the item. While Tower23 is awesome, I would skip the restaurant experience at JRDN.</Review>< rating>

One of my favorite restaurants... The view is amazing. Everything on the menu is so good. JRDN is a great place to hang out at the bar or have dinner. Also, the staff is really friendly. Check out this restaurant if your in the Pacific Beach area.</text>

<text>Wow , I am native, took my brother to lunch month, Brother got the lobster BLT, bottom soggy crisp top,said its probably sat,took 45 min to get lunch. Only 4-6 people in the restaurant. Told it took so much time to get my sushi nigiri chefs special. The sushi was warm. maybe Ill lose weight.What ticks me off is this place has gone down hill. I was here 3 years ago and was impressed, what happened? Did you loose your passion and caring?< /text><Time>1531764296320<//Time><rating>3</rating>< userid>

<text>The view is what sets JRDN apart from other restaurants in PB. The bar is open from the inside and outside to view the beach and ocean directly and its quite a good site. Decent food on the menu. Great happy hour options as well. Drinks at the bar are well done as well. Really like the bartenders they have working here. Parking is done through the hotel, which is always easier than trying to find parking on the street in PB.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>This is the best place for a nice date in Pacific Beach. The restaurant is fancier than most you will find in the area. The views are phenomenal. Enjoy great food and drinks while watching the sunset over the Pacific Ocean.<//review>< pics>

<Text>Went here for my wife's birthday, and our only regret is that our budget didn't allow us to sample more of their fare. I had the seared tuna, she had the scallops; both dishes were very tasty. The scallops didn't have the best sear I've seen, but the plating and pork belly they came with may have made up for that. The wine list was fine, but not exhaustive. Overall, we had a good time! Oh, and definitely ask for a patio seat. Fantastic sunset views!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<text>Food looked good but tasted like a heart attack - I had the ribs with mashed potatoes - there was so much butter ---- and too much salt- not elegant tasting - just elegant looking. Service was ok for a busy Friday nt given its right on the beach and has a lively bar area. Will not be going back. Just not worth it - should have eaten in n out instead or subway - would have tasted way better and much cheaper.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Had brunch there. Great option on a craft of bubbly for the table with different mixers - go with blood orange or sample them all. The sticky bun is bomb but quite filling so order at your own risk and have at least two other friends join you, best to share. Had the chicken and waffles. I'd recommend but I'm not a fan of my chicken being drizzled in syrup so that was a downside for me but still tasty. Also we had a vegan with us and even she mistakenly ordered something with chorizo without realizing they replaced it free of charge, which was appreciated. Def will do a boozy brunch again there<//text>

After we told them we had a dog, they seated us on the patio, and we ordered, a manager said no dogs on patio. Just to be clear we have seen dogs in the patio and staff confirmed dogs have been on the patio. That's messed up! If you have a rule, make sure all your people know it, so you don't waste your customer's time. Won't be going back.< /review>

First night in San Diego and chose this restaurant as we were staying in The hotel ..having spent some time looking down on various diners throughout the day from our balcony our mouths were watering at the diverse and varied menu.
Read various reviews beforehand and all spot on..food was delicious ( wings to share all round , 3 sushi dishes and 1 Californian Sushi).
All fresh and prestntation was super !
Staff are so friendly and attentive ..would recommend to anyone in the area 👍🏼</review>

Tiny tiny little bay scallops (yes I do know bay scallops are supposed to be small) covered in a yucky sauce containing grapes and something unidentifiable possibly dried mushrooms? Other than that everything was great. Impeccable service, excellent tuna nachos and O2 sushi roll.< /text>< pics>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>It's right next to the walking path next to the beach. Great place to people watch if you get a seat outside. Awesome place, probably the best place I've been to in PB.

Brings in a pretty swanky crowd of people at night that hang out around the bar.

It's inside of the hotel and there is valet parking.

It's hard to pick my favorite thing on the menu because everything I've had there so far has been good.<//Review>< username>

< Review>
stunning views, people and prices at this happening restaurant in the hotel tower 23 on pacific beach. it can be incredibly noisy so reserve a table outside if the weather's good and enjoy a romantic sunset dinner. innovative menu lets you pair entrees including fantastic steak with different rubs. sauces and sides. attentive if slightly standoffish service.</Review>

<Text>We brought our friends here tonight and JRDN did not disappoint.  Both my friend and I made the create your own salad with 5 topping choices.  Because it was our main entree they made it larger than normal.  Jayme our server overheard us toasting to our friend's 25th anniversary.  He surprised us with an anniversary dessert of a chocolate mousse cake that was very thoughtful.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

As we were leaving and getting our parking validated, the manager said they might have vegan or GF in the future.

Didn't know I was allergic to Lobster. Had an awesome meal at JRDN. Then finished the last few bites of my daughter's lobster pasta. Within seconds I passed out. No alcohol consumed. When I regained consciousness I was more dizzy than I have ever been. For some reason, one of the JRDN staff, was committed to getting me out of there quickly. He kept telling me he wanted me to go wait outside for the ambulance. I kept telling him if I didn't sit down or lay down I felt like I would vomit. This guy was sure it would be in JRDN'S best interest to get me outside for some reason. I still can't figure out why.

Thankfully, my wife helped me get to a comfortable place to lay down in the lobby. Then one conscientious employee of JRDN with EMT training helped me until the ambulance and paramedics arrived. That one guy still wanted me to go outside but he was basically told to pack sand by the professionals on the scene. It was so strange to be treated like someone who had walked into JRDN and overdosed on drugs (like a hobo on H) or drank a whole bottle of liquor and passed out. The entire staff, except for the guy with EMT training acted like we were riff raff that needed to be kicked out for disrupting the place. Our server obviously knew nobody at our table ordered any alcohol.

The manager did call my wife yesterday and apologized profusely. He ended up refunding us for the meal. Funny, because JRDN called to make sure we paid the bill while I was in the ambulance on the way to the emergency room. If you plan never to have any sudden health issues you might like eating at JRDN. But, if you're a typical human being you might want to stick to restaurants where you won't be asked to "wait on the curb" if you have an allergic reaction to food or a heart attack.</review>

Location location location, it's right on the boardwalk overlooking the mighty Pacific Ocean. They recently redid the space and it looks even better than ever. The food is really really good. They have good happy hour specials and the bar area serves food at the bar and tables on the patio are on a first-come first-serve basis. The restaurant area sells high-end food and is white tablecloth service and is perfect for a nice romantic dinner...👌👌✌️✌️<//review>

Eaten here on several occasions, have raved about it, and brought friends and family and finally I write a review lol. Just came from there and this place has just made my day one again. I don't have a favorite item here because most everything is so good but their calamari with perfectly FRIED broccoli and mussels sitting in a to die for sauce are definitely worth mentioning. Brunch here is amazing and at night they get really creative with their dishes. They have a little something for everyone depending on what time you dine. Love this place. Highly recommend it!< /review>

Attentive and on-the-toes waitress. I am from out of town and went with my family, a party of 7. Everyone enjoyed the experience. We had sashimi and oysters and bone marrow as appetizers. Diverse main courses. If you are in the area and looking for an upscale meal, have no hiesitations to go here. We didn't have desserts because of the Baked Bear ice cream shop just a couple of blocks away. I did have a Negroni to start the evening (traditional, not the one on their craft cocktail menu which isn't made with gin) and it was very well prepared.< /Text>< rating>

Such good food! We ordered the steamed muscles to start, then I had the ahi poke tuna seaweed salad and my boyfriend had the lamb burger. The macadamia dessert was to die for! Kelli was our server, and she was amazing! Most, if not our whole meal, was based off of her awesome recommendations. We will definitely be coming here when we come back and we will most certainly try to sit with Kelli again--great service!<//review>

I get to enjoy many meals here because I work and live nearby. Obviously the view is great but the most impressive thing about it is the consistency of the food and service.

Often bring clients and family members to this spot because it's tough to order a dish that's not above average, the accessibility and ease of the valet and to show off, especially at sunset.

Without question one of the top 5 best places to eat in PB.</text>

<review>The atmosphere was amazing, the wine glasses were dirty, my beer glass was disgusting, I sent back the beer. The waitress did not know her drinks but tried to play it off,  lol, I had to correct her and explain simple differences in sparkling wine. My short ribs and hash were great, presentation sucked, lobster blt, it looked amazing, lacked flavor and was super dry. Lunch for 2 ppll, $100, the reason I pay high prices is, well, I expect clean glassware, a knowledgeable staff, and amazing food. This was a fail, the waitress was friendly and is the reason I gave this review a 3 instead of a 1.......I never saw a manager on the floor, this is why the bar is dirty, at least check your glassware.......</review><rate>3</rate><Name>Jesse Tait< /Name><date>1546403979126</date>< user>

<text>I've pretty much eaten every item on the menu.... whether you are looking for a casual brunch, a romantic dinner or a group business dinner, JRDN has you covered. My top favorites right now are the duck sandwich for lunch and the ribeye with smoked potatoes. The service is great with friendly staff and a good bartenders. This would be an awesome place to take out of town guests because it is right on the beach and very "so-Cal".</text><name>Stacy Long<//name><date>1350340332468</date>< rate>

Awesome food.  Their lobster bisque is outstanding.  A little pricey but would be a great place for a special event, e.g. anniversary, birthday, etc..  Their services are great but can be a little slow on busy day.  I tried their scallop - just perfectly cooked.<//review>

Great food and great service, unfortunately I can only give them 4 stars because I was really looking forward to oysters and the surf and turf roll.  The oysters were apparently bad and by 6:30 p.m. they were out of wagu beef for their surf and turf roll.<//Text>

<Review>The eggs benedict was some of the worst my husband and I have had. The hollandaise was pretty awful and one of my eggs was 100% hard-boiled. My friends really enjoyed their meals, though. They seemed understaffed today, so the service was not the best it's been. Great location, view, and atmosphere.< /Review>< user_id>

I've eaten here 3 times & every meal has been very good.  Smaller portions which I liked but if you want a hugh meal you won't get it here.  The calamari is amazing & the margaritas are excellent.  Will go back again.< /review>

<review>JRDN is an open air lounge overlooking the Pacific Ocean and PB Boardwalk where the nightly main event is the sunset over the water. A very close second would probably be the people watching on the boardwalk.

This is a swanky under the sky, happy hour, flip flop, white table cloth, nothin fussy beachfront restaurant to unwind and refuel.

Off of the raw bar menu, what could be more delicious than clams with butter or fresh oysters in their shells?

The spirit bar specializes in craft cocktails and personal wine and the offerings were solid.

All I wanted today was an outside prototypical California beach happy hour hangout where I can buy a Bombay Sapphire Martini, up, with olives and a little basket of clams.< /review>< Date>

<Review>This is an excellent spot to sit with a drink and watch the sun set. Happy hour is until 7pm with $5 wines and $3 off apps. Delicious ceviche.

Indoors can be a bit loud, as it's an echo-y kind of bar, but outdoors is the place to be.</Review>< pics>

This place is super classy and nice, but to me, not really "beachy". Pretty expensive! I don't often go in, but people always seem to be having a good time there.</Text>

<Text>Very good creative American restaurant, with great outdoor seating and views.

Food was about 4 stars, views and everything else adds one. Great bread, very nice steak and fish, chocolate desert was the only thing that was just ok.< /Text></record>

<Review>Made a reservation for the patio to watch the sunset with dinner. Waitress finally showed up and asked for drink order after 5+ mins of first sitting. My husband didnt like his drink and she swapped it out no problem. Never saw her again... we finished our cocktails went to yhe bathroom and she finally showed up... asked if we wanted food and i said no we will rake the check, i dont want to wait an hour dor food. So then 5+ mins later no check but gets the table next to us just fine... we left the  ash amount we thought would cover our two drinks and left.... if your looking for a nice quite dinner sont go here, its club themed inside... not paying $50 per entree when i cant enjoy dinner conversation.</Review><Date>1526789472006</Date>< resp>

Sat at the ocean peir looking bar enjoying a single West Coast IPA and people watched the Pacific Beach boardwalk. Was the perfect place to kick back after stopping by South Coast Surf Shop next door. The service at the bar was very respectful, prompt and knowledgable. Very clean place. Can't wait to go back!<//text>

I was so so so disappointed. The manager Chris Wood was extremely rude and treated us in a manner that was entirely unacceptable. Right when we walked in he told us we need to hurry up because there was another reservation after us. Chris was unprofessional, condescending, and offensive. We were so upset by his words and treatment that we left before ordering food. We will never go back.<//Review>

Nice place to visit, sucks the happy hour went up in cost because that was the only time I felt comfortable paying for anything when it wasn't for a celebration of some kind. They treat celebrations very well!!!<//review>

JRDN has it all: exceptional service, a beautiful location, free valet parking right by the water, and the best food on the beach.

If you make for a weekend brunch, their bloody mary is a must, and I'm not an easy one to please when it comes to this breakfast staple.
For lunch, you can't go wrong with the lobster BLT with truffle fries (the best tasting and best priced twist on a lobster roll in PB) or the chorizo steamed mussels.
The Lobster BLT comes stacked with lobster meat on a lightly sweet grilled bread, with butter lettuce, fresh tomato, and a few delicious strips of bacon. YUM!
If you're in from out of town, you can get a room at Tower 23, with its awesome rooftop pool, and stop through JRDN for an incredible steak dinner as well.
JRDN offer the primest cuts of beef prepared to your specifications, with my favorite always including the bone marrow butter. And if you want a little surf with your turf, add a half dozen oysters on the half shell.
You can enjoy all of this right on their beachfront patio, or inside with a beautiful sunset view and spectacular service!</Text>

Expect to pay 50.00 for 2 people for breakfast, and it is very basic. No refills on orange juice. Also customer service was ok, but not diverse enough. Me being half white and latina wanted to see more diverse faces. No latins or black individuals were servers. Didn't like that. Overall ok, not the best. They can do better than this for sure based on cost and diversity.< /review>< Pictures>

(5 stars for food, 1 star for service) My best friend and I visited this restaurant on Sunday May 21st 2017 to celebrate the last night of our weekend getaway to San Diego. The food was incredible but unfortunately, we received the WORST service either of us have ever had. Our server Jaydn was incredibly rude and treated both of us horribly - by the end of the night it was obvious he was expecting a small bill/tip from us. Jaydn greeted us and returned about 15 minutes later to finally take our order. My friend started off by ordering a salad and before even asking me if I would like one, he snarkily asked if we were sharing the salad (I assumed he was hinting at the fact that we couldn't afford two salads). Next, we ordered our entrees. My friend ordered the cheapest steak and Jadyn cracked a smirk as he wrote it down. Then I ordered the atlantic Salmon and he cracked another smirk as he wrote that down as well (again probably hinting at the fact that we couldn't afford anything more expensive - seriously???). Before receiving our food my friend mentioned to him that she never received a napkin and his response was, "Oh what the hell?" Worst of all, this was the LAST we saw of our server until receiving the bill. For the rest of the night, the busser working in our section took care of us - refilling our waters, asking us how we were enjoying our meal, and even offering the desert menu and taking our desert orders. He was incredibly nice and was the only reason we even decided to stay. We finally were greeted by our server again after finishing our desert where he asked us if we would like the bill to be together or separate. After requesting to have separate bills, he nodded and without walking away, immediately handed us the bill (we assumed he already separated the check). But when we opened the tab we noticed he put it on one tab which defeated the purpose of him even asking our preference because he clearly was going to just do it the way he wanted to anyways. My friend and I still tipped 20% out of respect for the busser but I regret not complaining to a manager about our server which is why I am writing this review. At the end of the day, I would just like to thank the incredible busser for saving the day and still making our experience an enjoyable one.</text>

< Review>
I absolutely loved this place. I came here for my anniversary with my girlfriend and was glad that they made my anniversary special by giving us a great table with an ocean view and an amazing dining experience. Here is what I had and can recommend:

petite platter
6 oysters, 3 jumbo prawns,
3 little neck clams, ¼ lb. alaskan king crab

8oz. tenderloin
cedar river farms
arizona

And we had an almond crusted scallop dish that was on special. The scallop dish was the best. I could not believe how good the filet mignon was. I will definitely be back.</Review>

<rating>4</rating><Text>JRDN is not your ordinary restaurant in Mission Beach; if you want ordinary, there are a fat double-handfull of restos within walking distance of JRDN--and dinner for two-to-three at any of those will cost you what a single meal at JRDN will.

But you won't get your meal cooked to perfection.  And the cut won't be so generous.  The flavors will be pedestrian, ordinary and expected...and you'll probably have a good time and save a few bucks, right?  But you should try JRDN, at least once.

We've read some of the reviews below, and have never had a negative experience (re: Katherine, 6-10-2010) reported; we almost wonder if she was at the same JRDN, but any place can have an off night.  We too have noticed the main server is standoffish, almost cold, while the assistants are gracious, warm and helpful.

The meals tonight were the rib eye (medium rare) w/"Chef's Thunder,"an amazing reduction of onions, bleu cheese & balsamic, with Yukon gold mash & onion rings, and the seared scallops with lemon risotto and a JRDN salad (you pick a base and five ingredients from a list--fun!).  Our daughter had the "Real Mac & Cheese," but fell dead asleep after a long day; she'll enjoy it tomorrow.

Both adult dishes were straight-up perfect, with wonderful flavors and textures.  My wife is especially picky about her scallops and could not say enough good things about them. My steak was cooked to medium-rare perfection and nicely lean without being dry.

We did not order drinks, and were mildly vexed to see the "Naturo Still" water (which we did not order, but magically appeared on our table) was billed to us--despite it tasting more like tap water, and the bottle being obviously re-used. A strangely cheap note in an otherwise top-shelf performance.

Dinner for two adults and one child, no alcohol, with taxes: $103.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Food quality has seriously dropped, reducing my review from 4 stars to 2 or 1. The service was disappointing, general mood has changed which is a shame.< /text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>(Translated by Google) “Nothing like that, you can go once another”
in fact, what else to add, there is a pleasant view of the sunset, and generally the location is good, the service is attentive and fast, the food is tasty, but somehow without frills and ahh ... The crab soup is sweet, scallops too, maybe the local flavor, I don’t know. .. I expected a little more, maybe I'll go again, but I’ll definitely forget if I don’t.

(Original)
“Ничо так, разок другой сходить можно”
собственно что еще добавить, есть приятный вид на закат, да и вообще локейшн хороший, обслуживание внимательное и быстрое, еда вкусная, но как то без изысков и ахх... Суп из крабов сладкий, гребешки тоже, может местный вкус, не знаю... Ожидал чуть больше, возможно зайду еще раз, но точно забуду если не зайду.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>
