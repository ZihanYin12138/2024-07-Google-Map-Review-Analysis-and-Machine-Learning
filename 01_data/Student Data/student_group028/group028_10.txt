<text>Our brand new car was damaged in a hit and run but now it looks like it never even happened :-)
I cannot say enough good things about our experience at Fix Auto. They were very efficient in providing an estimated repair cost and told us it would take approximately 3 days once they started the work. We got our car back within 3 days and they went above and beyond in delivering the repaired vehicle to our house. They detailed it inside and out and it looks brand new again. We couldn't be more pleased with the extremely professional and efficient service we received.
If you need collision repair then look no further than Fix Auto. They are fantastic!!</text>< Pics>

Great experience!  Hector Arroyo and his team did a great job repairing and painting my front bumper for the price that he quoted me, and as a courtesy, buffed-out my foggy headlights, reattached some loose molding around the rear window, removed an air-dam where my new tires were rubbing, and washed it!  Therefore, I recommend “Fix Auto” repair shop in Indio.< /Text>

Hector was very informative when I first called Fix after the accident. Once we dropped off the vehicle, both Hector and JoAnna continued to keep me updated on progress and estimated completion, which ended up being a day earlier than expected. I would definitely recommend this place.< /text>

Upon return, repair looked like duct tape painted over, panel binding, doors not shutting properly, zero clean up no mud flaps on damaged side, told by manager not all cars have mud flaps on both sides??.   I have cleaned them many times and I definitely know that my car has mud flap all around.   When the mud flaps arrived, they were install incorrectly.   While car was at Fix Auto, scuffs were scraped on undamaged side of care and on the instrument panel.  8 times back to get items repaired properly.   Not offered any compensation for all the inconvenience, but owner put approximate $25 gas into the car and dealt with internal employee issues.

Amazing customer service!!! I was greeted right away and they started getting me a quote. I went to 3 other places and they were the most affordable. They got to work on my car the same day! 3 days later my fender and bumper looked brand new!!! They quote they gave was the price I played. No hidden fees and they even gave me a 10% discount right off the top.

If I ever need body or paint work I will go back there in  a heartbeat!!!

GREAT JOB FIX AUTO INDIO!!!< /review>

Assignment & painting done well and gave special attention to buffing things out. Replaced a windshield and checked the heads up display to be sure it was ok. It was an insurance claim with only minor scratches, but they went far beyond in repainting hood, both fenders, front. Gave a car rental for a week. Not 5 star only because they made us come back 3 days beyond original date for final polish, then we waited more than an hour beyond their stated delivery time.<//text><Date>1513640713113</Date><rating>4</rating></record>

<Review>The atmosphere was great. The live music and dancing were really nice. The only issue was the male bartender charged my tab for our drinks and charged me for 7 of my drinks when I only had 2. The rest of the drink charges for my group were accurate. I was the driver for my group and purposely limited myself to 2 drinks early in the night. No one else in my group drank what I was drinking, so i know they purposefully overcharged me.< /Review><Resp>{'time': 1582574484227, 'text': "Hello Alex,\nI'd like to speak with you about your visit to Broken Arrow at your earliest convenience.

It was a Friday night. They had country line dance lessons but as soon as the DJ started it was all 90s club music. Really wish there was more country, and also the DJ was really only passable with his mixing. Would have been better just playing a Country Playlist.</Text>

<review>Went to the opening weekend and it felt like a smaller version of the saddle rack in Fremont.  It even had the same band! It's advertise as a country bar yet no one is dressed like cowboys or cowgirls. Overall, I'll definitely be going there again.</review>< GmapID>

<text>The building has been a bar for a long time and the previous establishment was a typical hole in the wall dive bar. Since the new owner took over, remodeled and rebranded, it has a much better vibe. Staff is friendly, music is great, and I will be frequenting more often.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80903d3c6c714889:0xe6e9fea02213087f</GmapID></record>

<text>Dive bar in a good way. Jukebox, darts and pool. Good enough liquor and beer selection. I believe they have karaoke once a week too. The bartenders weren't too chatty which isn't a problem, just depends on what kinda customer you are.< /text>< Pictures>

After I made a service call to my home warranty, they sent out a company named “Roman Rooter” who tried to scam me.  They claimed they needed to access the roof to clear a sink drain and wanted to charge me $189 on top of my co-pay.  I refused and called Charlie who came out the same day and fixed it in about 10 minutes for half the price (and he never accessed the roof, which he informed didn’t even connect to the sink anyway).  The world needs more honest and kind human beings like Charlie.< /Text>

When I had plumbing issues, I called every single plumbing company and they gave me outrageous prices. But I called American Plumbing and they gave me a great and fair price. Charlie was a very nice man, and went above and beyond. Best plumber in San Diego.< /text>

<review>American plumbers arrived on time, were neatly dressed, polite and professional. Justen and his apprentice came, and had shoe covers on. They were able to unblock my main drain, and able to correct another problem I had. There was a small additional charge, but was expected. BTW, they took pictures of a round plastic item the Tile people accidentally dropped down toilet. It was on the end if snake. I will need additional work soon, and will have them do the job. This is the second time I've used them.<//review>< pics>

Charlie was amazing, he came to fix our sink disposal and even taught me how to fix it for the future and explained how it gets jammed. He even left me a little tool to do so. We got so lucky to find him, he is definitely one of the best if not the very best of all San Diego plumbers. Thank you Charlie!< /text>

<Text>I searched Google for a highly qualified plumber in San Diego, CA & American Plumbing was one of the 1st sites that showed up. He had a plethora of 5 star reviews &, after reading a few, I decided to call. He was very pleasant on the phone & indicated that he could be @ my home btween 1 - 3 pm. He called me @ 12 noon & came right over. After diagnosing my problem, he got right on it! Very personable & did NOT try to talk to me until he completed the work. He stayed very focused & did an excellent job for me! (At least I wasn't leaking anymore!) I highly recommend this personable, hard working & reasonably priced San Diego plumber.<//Text><UserId.>104455375911119437333<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Best plumbing company in San Diego!!  Charlie was the only company that called back. They came right away and they were super friendly and professional and fixed our clogged main line. They even gave me some professional advice if the clog should return. I wouldn’t hesitate for a second If I needed their services again and you shouldn’t either.  You won’t be disappointed.</text>

This has been the best plumbing experience. I live in San Diego and needed a quick fix for my toilet. I was able to call in the morning and they were here in the afternoon. Charlie was extremely polite and professional San Diego plumber. I ended up having a dog toy stuck in my toilet. After a quick 10 mins my problem was solved. I highly recommend this San Diego plumbing company.< /Text>

<text>Charlie @sandiegoplumber came to the rescue in an hour for my kitchen drain clog. My husband tried for hours after renting a snake from the local hardware store. Many F-bombs later we called Charlie. He was done within 20minutes!! We will never try this again....wasted the $50 rental fee and while Charlie fixed it all for $80. Life saver!! Thanks Charlie!!<//text>< pictures>

<review>Nice guy but he was unable to help. I called Charlie to come out to fix a leak under the house which a home inspector found. He arrived within the hour, which was good. He found the leak that I was already aware of by the home inspector,
Which was good. He told me to takecare of it by tightening up the bolt myself. I asked him how much it would cost me for him to do it... he was hesitant to give me a quote,  and said he has other jobs to go to. Before he left, he asked me to give him 5 stars on google review and write something to make him look good. I did not use his services so I can't give him 5 stars if he didn't actually fix anything. That would dishonest to others. Sorry.< /review>< date>

<Text>Called Charlie very early the morning after Christmas to fix an emergency for my shower. He picked up promptly and was at my house within 45 minutes to address the issue! What better service could you ask for during the holiday?! Charlie spent the time to go over the issues with us, the cost, along with all options we had to fix the issue. After deciding what route we wanted to take he very efficiently procured the parts and fixed the issue. His pricing is also extremely fair. I will be using Charlie for future needs and would recommend his to family and friends.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1420307855861, 'text': 'Thank You Jen Stoike for the kind words and the patronage, glad to be of service.'}<//Resp>< GmapID>

Charlie came out after hours and helped us unclog a backed up kitchen sink. He was friendly, professional, and the prices were more than reasonable. He explained what he was doing and why he was doing it so we never felt left in the dark. Charlie was very knowledgeable and quite obviously cares about the quality of his work. He even gave us tips as to how to avoid future problems!< /review>

So, I'd meant to call a plumber all day today, and looked up and it was 4:45 pm. Hurried up and did a Google search and after scanning results, ended up with two I wanted to call. The first one was a company that I called and got a voice mail. The Yelp page said they typically respond in 4 hours. I left a message. Next one I clicked, was American Plumbing. Charlie was the owner, and it mentioned he could help my drain problem.

Even though it said his hours were til 5 pm, I called anyway, thinking I would just set something up for tomorrow. Charlie actually answered, and when I inquired about making an appointment for tomorrow, he said "I'm still working today!". He asked where I lived, and I told him. He laughed and said "I'm right around the corner from you now, I can be there in 15 minutes!" (I was in disbelief). So I told him to come on when he was done.

He did, and fixed this drain that had given us the biggest headache for a while now, in about 15 minutes. He also gave me advice on how to keep it clear. We're now enjoying our newly cleared drain..Thanks Charlie!<//Text>

Charlie was AWESOME!  He did a great job fixing my garbage disposal and the handle to my shower.  He even gave me a tool to fix my disposal in the future.  I'd recommend him to anyone.<//text>

<text>Charlie had serviced our old house a few years ago and luckily I remembered him when we needed a plumber at our new place. He was courteous, on time and very honest.  We originally called to have him snake our shower drain as well as our downstairs neighbor's drain.  When he saw her drain he said it was probably ok and if we still wanted him to snake it he would but  he felt it wasn't necessary after looking at it.  It was refreshing to not be talked into something we didn't necessarily need.  I decided to go ahead anyway because I am a better safe than sorry kind of person.  His prices were reasonable and e even fixed our  loose sink to !

I  would highly recommend Charlie for your plumbing needs and  plan to use him again if we ever need a plumber.  Great services, very professional and great prices.</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I called right before they closed, and Charlie said he’d be over in an hour. Best plumbers in San Diego. Poor guy spent 2 hours trying to fix our clogged toilet. Had to come back next day and did a great job! Would definitely recommend these San Diego Plumbers.

<Date>1469649270067< /Date><text>Bottom Line: horrible job. He cut way more tile than he should have and punctured the porcelain of the sink with his grinder. Furthermore, I spent an hour cleaning my kitchen after he left because he didn't clean up at all.

Story: I needed to change out the faucet in my kitchen sink to hook up a dishwasher. Instead of an easy swap, the nipples that came out of the wall disintegrated in my hands. I bought a nipple extracted from Ace down the street, and the damn thing broke off inside the nipple. I was stuck with calling a plumber. I first called Bill Howe, but he couldn't get a plumber out until 3-5. I called American. He had a 5 star review. He arrived at 2:08 in the afternoon, which was a little later than he said he would arrive, but not by much. He then told me he would take out a little bit of the tile and try to salvage the soap dish behind the sink. Ok get going. He then proceeded to cut out WAY more tile than he said he would, he cut two notches in the the porcelain of the sink, he used my tools, and he used the replacement nipples that I bought. He did a horrible job in that he punched out way more tile than he needed to. He broke tiles, he went way beyond the edge of the sink. Looking at it pisses me off because I could have broken out the tile that way and probably would have done a better more careful job. In any event, he charged me the full $300 even though he used my tools and my plumbing parts, then as he was leaving he said he would take off $5 if I wrote a review. He said if I reviewed on Google, Yelp, or any other review site, he'd take $5 off for each review. After I repeatedly said no, he upped it to $10. I couldn't believe it. In stead of not charging the full $300 because he used my tools and parts, he wanted me to review his work. Well, here's my review, free of bias. My kitchen is cut up, I have to retile way more area than was necessary, and I am really upset with this job. Horrible work. Did I mention this was all original 1946 tile? He completely destroyed my kitchen sink area. $300 not well spent. #AnyOtherPlumber</text><pictures>None< /pictures><user>111597355804131238330</user>< rate>

In the last 5 years I've called on plumbers  3 times and like most people I shopped around for a good deal or special.  In the first 2 instances I found several plumbers who offered a compatible or the very same "best deal" drain service as several other local plumbers. When called upon,  before ever performing  the best deal service to resolve my problem.  The plumbers claimed things were looking grim, and put on a 15 minute sales pitch about how I needed to spend 3 times more money on the upgraded service that even included hi-tech cameras to look for any unknown problems and in return I spend 5 minutes explaining why I only needed pay for the service we agreed upon.
So today  when I discovered I have drain problem that has tapped my resources, I was sure to question what the Plumbers advertized deal included and in doing so discovered obvious bait and switch tactics within some offers.  When I talked to Charlie at American Plumbing he was straight forward with his answers and sounded willing to put his best effort into the service he advertized to resolve my problem.  Charlie showed up within 2 hours, we discussed the problem, the history and he went to work in spite of the displacement and severity of the blockage, and had it cleared in two hours.
I was certainly happy to pay the $100.00 service Bill.

Pictures say a thousand words.
Yes. That is a visible chunk of lint in this picture.
They told me they would repair it but the next appointment was 3 months out because they had so many repairs they had a backlog.<//Review>

The price is way too high now. Nearly 300 dollars for a small Honda. The back tint isn't even that dark even though I asked for limo, it's almost as light as the front . I don't think I'll be back.< /review>

Another awesome job! I brought in my wife’s 2019 pathfinder to have tint installed on every window and they did NOT disappoint. I felt the price was fair for the amount of work and quality  involved. Not only did they follow threw with the estimated time of completion but they exceeded it by 1hr. Highly recommended and will continue to return, Thank you!<//review>

<review>Jimmy, is very rude, to women, I observed.
The whole staff took lunch at the same time, I've been waiting over an hour. Jimmy is putting other people before me, he dumped all his stress of the heat on me. I've been coming here sometime around  2004 ish, I've never been treated  so poorly.

I was in a few months ago and George was who I dealt with, not one complaint.

The work done here is quality and the prices reflect the quality of service.

Myself,  I will never be returning to this establishment,  Jimmy is the only cause of this.

He gives New Yorker's a bad name.

Try not to come when the short little man with leprechaun ears is working,  unless you have you're  husband accompany you.</review><Response>None< /Response>< name>

EXTREMELY over priced. Said they have to take my spoiler off to put tint on? Seriously? I call BS! He doesn't even carry true ceramic tint since he broke his contract on having multiple brands! Cheapskate!</Review>

We have been in business over 30 years and try very hard to not raise our prices we are a professional company. The only car we need to take the spoiler off on is the Honda Civic hatchback because there is no other way to have the back window done the correctly since it is all one big window even though the spoiler makes it appear as two pieces.  We do not butcher any car and always take pride in every single car that we do. We do carry a true ceramic film as well so I’m not sure where you are getting that from. The only thing I can think of is if you perhaps called a different shop? Hope we can do business with you in the future have a great day.'}</Resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>This place has pretty darn good sandwiches!  This is an old-fashioned ran store that is a local owner who I know from Calvary Chapel.  His boys work there too and are hard workers!  It is great how everyone talks to one another just like 50 years ago!  They are all so very nice!  I enjoy going there, it is like eating with family.  I hope God continues to bless this place and all of the employees as well as the owner!  I highly recommend this place.  Also was able to buy some "raw" milk here!  Reminded me of growing up on the farm that's for sure!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808283476effb1a9:0xdca2d9328e14bc04< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Awesome selection of meats! They've also got a deli counter with a large selection of sandwiches. Helpful & friendly staff. Be aware, the front parking lot is small & will not facilitate trailers or oversized vehicles.< /Text>< Pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Id rather eat Raleys sandwiches anyday of the week. 7 bucks for a sandwiches that takes 3 bites to eat and doesnt even taste that well at all. I could of made a sandwich better myself. Poor excuse for a sandwich and price if you ask me. Customer service wasnt that great either. Take your money to raleys for a sandwich.< /text>< user>

Horrible! Their sandwiches taste like dust.  Also, none of them wear masks.  And then they have the gall to get really close to your face while they talk to you even if you have a mask to make sure you feel unsafe.  This place is a health hazard and should be closed down.<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><name>Jesse Holley</name><Text>This is the best deli in Red Bluff, perfect stop after fishing the Sac River or Battle Creek, or grabbing a sandwich on your lunch break.  Wednesday they have pulled pork, and they do Tri-tip on Fridays.  I recommend getting the pulled pork, adding coleslaw on sourdough with pepper Jack or provolone. It's grubbin!  Not only a deli they have high quality meats and an amazing selection of rubs and sauces, oh, did I forget to mention custom butchering because they do that too.  Really a great business, they are friendly and helpful as well, definitely earned these 5 stars time and time again I come away impressed.<//Text>< response>

My birthday sandwich was AMAZING! So their deal is that you can get any sandwich with a $7.99 value for free on your birthday; if you want an upgrade, you pay the difference. For my pulled pork sandwich I paid the extra $1 and was beyond satisfied. The ladies there are also super helpful and speedy. Highly recommend!< /Text>

9 T-bone's , Not going to lie the meat was delicious there was nothing wrong with the quality of the meat it's self. The only thing that I disliked was the eye was a little small on the cuts.<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>This is a True BBQ joint. Very tasty. I have been back three times. Kind of brings me back to Texas. Bad thing is, barbecue is so expensive in this state. And they don't give you the fixings to go with it like bread and pickles and onions. I guess I'm not in Texas anymore. But it sure tasted like I was. Great job A&R customs.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808283476effb1a9:0xdca2d9328e14bc04<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

THE CUSTOMER SERVICE are great and the meat are delicious and tender. I was surprise of the quality meat that are offer.  I was told by my friend of his quality and wanted to see for myself.  I always love butcher cut meats and the service that comes with it. Price is very reasonable and the quality is great.  Try them.  I am recommend it to all to give them a try.  I am a true consumer outside of Red Bluff city.<//text>

The staff answered any and all questions I had beforehand and during the process.
Please be advised that it is a drive-thru only (don't know if it has always been the case or justa pandemic precaution)(!). No Walk-ins(!).
Also, I was told to try and keep all the items in the trunk of the vehicle to make it easier for their team to pickup items and reduce exposure.
They were very professional throughout the whole time and made the situation a seamless one for me. Amazing team!<//Text></record>

Great service, fast and easy! Drive thru service, all you are asked is to place your car in park and turn engine off as the safety staff unloads all products from your car trunk. In and out in 2 minutes!<//Review>

Great place to dispose of unique waste like old electronics for FREE. They have a intuitive drive through system with friendly staff to direct you. They took my waste from the trunk and I was done in less than a minute.</Text>

<review>My truck was "too full" they only took half and they made me leave just to turn around to come right back seconds after being there. A waste of gas, time, and government resources. A perfect example of the bureaucracy that is destroying LA City.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Easy drop off from the car. The line of cars can get pretty long, snaking around the corner, but it moves pretty quickly. Be sure to not block the driveways and be patient with those unfamiliar with what is going on.<//review>< userid>

I can't believe I just discovered this place. I needed to get rid of e-waste. I just drove up, drove thru, popped the trunk and it was gone. I didn't even have to get out of my car!<//text>

Had a great experience dropping off. The woman at the gate was very friendly and the crew we're very respectful and efficient.  One of the men was sure to thank everyone for coming and even thank the car in front of me for taping up all the florescent bulbs they were bringing in. No complaints at all.</text>

<Text>It's only open on Saturdays which is a bit inconvenient but generally they're efficient and friendly. Today, however, I was in my second car which I want to protect from any possible damage so I parked out front and went to get the stuff off the passenger seat. A young woman approached me and said I'd have to drive through. I told her I didn't want to take this car in there and asked what they do for folks who don't have a car. She pointed behind herself and said we accommodate them over there. I said fine then you can accommodate me over there. She says why don't you just drive your car through so I told her again that I did not want to take this car in there, my husband had the other car today so I had to bring this one. So she goes to get someone to help and I get a box of items from the car and go towards the door of the place. She tells me to stop and not come in. Bear in mind I'm placing the stuff on the ground, not attempting to enter the facility. She needs to chill out! Went back to my car for one more item and gave it to the young African American guy who was picking up my stuff. HE was very polite and friendly!<//Text>< Pics>

This place is amazing.  You never get out of your car, since it's a safety issue, which is really nice.  The place is super clean, the people who take your waste out of the car are dressed in white jumpsuits and they are all really nice.  It literally takes a few minutes.  This whole process is a wonderful idea.  There should be more of them!!!  And everyone should use them!!!< /text>

On the East side of Balboa, just South of the gas station on the corner.  Put all items for pickup in the trunk.  Drive in, pop the lid, and they take it all out.  Drive away.  Seems to be relatively low-traffic.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>This place is fantastic. You drive in, stop the car, they open your trunk and take all your waste. It works best if the electronic waste (old computers, toasters, fluorescent lights, batteries, etc) is separated from the hazardous waste (oil, oil filters, paint). I put them in separate cardboard boxes. They empty out the boxes and I am on my way. No questions asked.They are only open on the weekends and not in the rain.

They do not accept tires or medical waste.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c29a8e69196c29:0xb068589d6774923a</Gmap_id><rate>5</rate><response>None</response>< user>

Electronics, Chemicals, Used oil, you know all the stuff that pollutes our landfills or takes forever to biodegrade.

Fast friendly delivery of my cheeseburger pizza and brownie to the truck while I wait to load at Pflug Packaging in Lathrop. I would definitely tell any trucker over here to not even hesitate to order delivery to the truck and if I pick up here I will be happy to order from this Papa John's location again. Thanks for the great experience, Manteca PJ!</text>

Pizza was not worth $20 for medium pizza. The employee kept sneezing then wiped his nose on his shirt. HE ALSO WAS NOT WEARING A MASK!</text>

EHHHH..... it's ok..... i guess..... just seems to be a place for people with decision disorders. " I don't wanna cook let's go out.... on second thought let's get delivery we don't have to tip for and buy an un-cooked pizza...... that we still have to cook. " now you've spent the same amount of money on gas and a pizza you still have to cook...... did you even tip them at the store? Did you really?? What the............. oh that's right that's papa Murphy's.< /review>

<Review>Horrible.  They were extremely cheap with the topping. I have never been anywhere where there was hardly any pepperoni or olives on a pizza. Unbelievable. I will never order from there again!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Just ordered delivery from here and our pizza came smashed to one side of the box. Our half and half pizza was 2 and a half slices to 5 and a half slices. We also ordered garlic knots and all of the garlic sauce had spilled and soaked both of the boxes. Very disappointing.</review>< user_id>

< Review>
I came in with a promotional offer and not only did they turn away my business but they were rude about it. If you are going to put out a promotional offer you need to follow through. I was told they were out of toppings which in my experience of working at a pizza place they should not be out of dough and still be open and able to take people in. I will never buy from them again and I hope the owner of this store sees this and starts treating people with more respect like I showed her.< /Review>

If I could rate it a zero I would!! We have had issues after issue with this location!! We have when stopped going there but recieved an offer for a free pizza from the franchise due to other issues we have had with a manager who says his name is "Alex". He is an older guy with thick accent and pepper colored hair. He does not belong in any kind of customer service position and hung up on me multiple times. We will continue to go to mountain like or jacks cafe over this place any day and sure with their customer service they will end up out of business soon!!! Avoid this headache and go to other pizza places here in town!!!<//Review>

<rating>1</rating><text>7/13/16@2003: Called and asked for delivery times and the woman stated 35 minutes.
I asked if I tipped a bonus if the delivery time could be shortened as I live literally 2 blocks from the store.
She hung up on me.
I called back and asked for the manager and the woman that answered this time asked me if she could help and I explained what had just happened and she stated that was the manager.
(For all those that are wondering why I couldn't just travel 2 blocks and pick it up) Because I have been drinking and I do not drink and drive.
I will be contacting corporate and filing a formal grievance.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x8090404188075d27:0xd621e8e8ed7d3a92<//gmap_id></record>

<review>I Guess the reviews speak for itself.

I stopped by today after picking up a deli sandwich for my wife at the restaurant next door.  It was 2:14pm today 3-1-2017, and I didn't see anyone in the Papa Johns Restaurant until about 2:18 (No biggie, but you may want to take smoke breaks after someone is maintaining the walk in clients).  After my 4 minute wait, I asked the lady who finally came back in from outside (she also had an attitude as if I'm the problem for cutting her break shorter than she probably want)  "What are your specials for today?"  I failed to get her name, but she was possibly in her 40's, very thin and very very short hair.  She told me I could get the 'Ultimate Meats Pizza for $11.00'.  I said sure, lets do that but please do not add Pepperoni.

She told me, she has to make it just like the photo!  I waited for a second, because I thought this was some stupid joke.  Than I realized, she really must be upset that I came in as a customer to your business to place an order during your break!!

I told her "That does not make sense, UNLESS IT PRE-MADE and you are sticking it in the oven, make it without the pepperoni!!!

Once again, she said "I have to make it like the photo".  This still boggles me!!  I had to break things down to layman's terms for her.  If this is a simple 3 topping pizza, and you only add 3 of each toppings, I just want two of those three toppings, 3 of each as you would normally do and charge me the same price.  This way your business makes more money, more product, more profit!!  She said understood, but she can only make it like the photo!

Well Papa Johns, you can keep your strict pizza ordering guidelines, because I will never go back here again.  Does not take rocket science to hire someone with a little common sense.

After my 5 minute debate with your customer service, when I finally started walking out, she yells "OK I CAN MAKE IT THE WAY YOU WANT!"

I don't care if you paid me to eat your pizzas here, not happening!

Also on the corner as I pulled out there was a sign $11.99 (Just .99 cents more!!!)  Large Pizza any Toppings!!!!!  WOW!!!! JUST WOW!!!!

I took my business to a local family owned Pizza place in manteca where the customer service has always been top notch.

One star is too much for this place.</review>< pics>

I don't eat pizza but fam says it was great. I called and placed the order and the gal on the phone was rude and was not knowledgeable. I asked how many does a medium feed and she says I don't know some people eat the whole thing...I asked what kind of soda do you have sge says what kind do you like. Seriously their staff requires customer skill training!</Review>

< review>
Worst costumer service by the owner himself i ordered a pan pizza online , when i got home and opened the box the cheese was smeared on the box, was uncooked and it didnt come with its usual garlic cup and pepperchini , when i called to complained the owner argued with that i was wrong and that there pizza are 100% inspected and high quality n that i was wrong  i had to drive all the way there to show him n he just stayed quite n didnt even apologize so i asked for my money back never go to this papa johns they suck , customer service sucks everyone knows u never argue with a customer<//review>

< Review>
Orderd pizzas 1 had a very large piece of hair in it called them back and advise them of the situation,they said we would have a new pizza in about 40 minutes,well guess customers don't matter anymore,it's all about the money,cause our new fresh pie was a no show, we will never order from this establishment again they just lost a customer.< /Review>

This place is great.😀 I hate saying that because he will be overrun with vehicles, but I won't have to get another smog check for 2 years, and if it helps a small business than that's great!!!
The owner works out of a shipping container which keeps his costs down. He is very nice, and even if you have to wait a short while it's worth the price which is VERY reasonable. Go there for a smog check, just not when I need to go.😣</Text>

<Text>Was dreading getting a smog check done because the place I usually go to takes up to an hour or more (plus the pricey fee). I wish I found this place sooner! Quick and easy 10min smog check with great customer service. Also the price, it’s a done deal. My new go to smog check site and will definitely recommend to family and friends. :) Thank you!!<//Text><UserId.>105550045368330696200<//UserId.><Rate>5<//Rate><gmap_id>0x80e9137dd8fdce99:0xed552066a02b507< /gmap_id>< Response>

Found this smog certification location on Yelp. Technician was very efficient. Total time to get my car smog certified was about 10 minutes.  Nice price too!  Entrance is on Guiterrez St off of DeLa Vina St address.  Will definitely come back for future smog certification requirements. Thanks for the fast service!</Review>

Just moved to California so my first smog inspection. The owner? was great and took care of me immediately. I'm sure I was annoying to him because I wanted to pay cash to save $2 on credit card. I had $30 bills on me and had to pay $4 in change. He told me to forget the $4 but I made him take it. Thank you to Mr. Kennedy. I sure appreciated the great service!</text>

<review>Great value and the owner is honest. I was trying to get a car to pass smog and another person in town wanted to charge me $100 to check after he had already charged me once and it didn’t pass. It didn’t sound right to me so I took it to Kennedy’s. He didn’t hesitate, put it on his device and informed I had a serious problem with my catylitic converter without charging me to check. I now bring all my cars here. Quick and a great price.</review>< pics>

Kennedy's is great. The smog check is cheap ($33 cash or $35 card). The first time I went to him I had brought a book to read while I waited. I might have gotten through just one paragraph when he told me my smog check was done! They are SO fast. He is honest and fast and very knowledgeable. He respects his customers and does not take advantage of people who don't know much about cars. Plus he has a cool accent :)

The second time I got a smog check (after Kennedy moved locations) I went to a place called "22.95 Smog Check SB" that I found through Google. When I got there I found out they were called something like "A&B  Hi-Tech Auto Care and Smog". I had a horrible experience that I will not rant about here. I had to pay that guy $176 for a smog check and the diagnostic after it failed. The last estimate he was going to give me came out to a total of $765+ and he wanted to charge me to do a Drive Cycle on my car. I called my husband and he told me to get my car back and get out of there. I did.
Long story short - after my husband and I replaced the radiator cap (which can be a simple fix for the error code I had), we did a Drive Cycle and diagnostic test (he has a device to do it at home). I then took it to Kennedy's, like I should have done in the beginning. It passed the smog test, I paid the $33, and it took less than 10 minutes. I told Mr. Kennedy about my experience with the other mechanic and he said it was ridiculous that the guy tried to charge me $125 for doing a drive cycle (Scott Kennedy just has the customer do it). Good thing I left A&B when I did. From now on I am only going to Kennedy's. I genuinely feel like my car is in good hands at this business.< /text>

Scott is quick and professional.  You literally just pull up and he says, "just leave it running", hands you a quick form to fill out and he's pretty much done by the time you've finished filling out the form.  $35 bucks and 10 minutes later.</text>

Holy moly! That was FAST! I never even got a chance to crack my book. Got in and out in about ten minutes for a smog check... No appointment. Also, all they needed was my registration (I don't have the notice from the DMV yet.) $35.95 out the door, no surprise fees. Fast, efficient, very friendly folks. I will definitely be back! Kennedy's Super Value Smog. Highly recommended!!< /text>

I just came from Kennedy's Super Value Smog.  It is a WINNER in all respects.  First, the inspector was friendly and respectful and got straight to work.  The SMOG check was completed in a matter of minutes (I had allowed 15 minutes).  Great idea that they transfer the results directly to DMV and also give you a copy.  $34 for cash and $36 fo credit/debit.  That's it; there is no finagling about extra fees.  The best experience I've ever had with this inspection.  Hats off to one fine business man!< /text>

<Review>Including all fees, cost out the door for a smog check was $34 in cash ($36 f you pay credit).  That's by far the best deal I've seen, plus I was in and out (no appointment) in less than 15 minutes, and as a bonus the people working there are nice.  There's no way you should get your smog check done anywhere other than here!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Kennedy's automotive shop is the cheapest place in Santa Barbara/Goleta to get your smog check, Probably the only place that's open on a holiday too.  I was extremely pleased with my service, everything took less than 15 min. An this was my 3rd time going to Kennedy's Super Value Smog, I won't go anywhere else.  Thank you!!!<//Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) The best, cheap, fast & honest smog check in Santa Barbara, no appointment required which is great, I highly recommend.

The best, honest, fast and cheap smog check service in santa barbara, the best thing of all is that you don't make an appointment.

Great walk up stairs, and the night views are beautiful.

When you visit in the evening, Please be respectful to neighbors, noise echos into their homes.
Enjoy the climb!</Text>

Awesome place to build cardio and leg strength. Great view from the top day and night. Usually do 2 big loops and run stairs few times. Easy way to get in at least 5 miles.</Review>

Located atop Communications Hill, San Jose’s “Little Tuscany.”  A nice place to do some cardio workouts and enjoy majestic views of San Jose. If you’re wondering why the median home price in San Jose is over $1.2 million, just climb to the top of this staircase and see.</Text>

<Review>Love these stairs.  They challenge me ohysiacally and if I want I can change up the routine by walking around the hill and back to the stairs.  This can be done in 3 different spots. Top, middle or bottom. Or just keep going.  Skip a step, walk sideways, do 1 step at a time.  Keep moving, the results are amazing.<//Review>< Pictures>

This is a great place to do a workout on stairs, 292 steps. Everybody is friendly and it feels nice and safe at least during the day. I understand there used to be some noise and other problems at night so it closes one hour after dusk and opens one hour before sunrise.

My first time I walked it up-and-down (up and down counted as one time) 4 times at a leisurely pace and it took about half an hour. I talk to others who were doing it 6 to 12 times. My legs felt a bit wobbly right after, but I'm not to sure now. A good start! :-)<//review>

Love going there with the family after 9. Of course, the kids have learned to be as quiet as possible and have occasionally told other walkers and joggers to keep their voices inside.</review>

When i first went to the stairs I didn't think much of them. When i got to the base of the stairs it got more Interesting. Not Until I Got To The Top Is When WoW! The View Is The Best. During the day its nice, When Night kicks in its Even Better. There's a jogging path around the Stairs.Its perfect to warm up or cool down before or after ur workout. The  air is fresh and cool it hits the spot when you need to catch a breath. The area is very calm and quiet, the people there are friendly and respectful. I go Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays around 10pm less traffic but still plenty of people.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Very good place to run and exercise especially in the afternoons. You can only stay one more hour after the sun goes down so as not to disturb the people who live around it.

Muy buen lugar para correr y hacer ejercicio especialmente en las tardes.. Solamente se puede estar una hora más después que el sol se oculta para no molestar a las personas que viven a los alrededores.</review>

Not expecting anything, just drove in for a bite. This place was good! I recommend the carnitas plate and the fresh tortillas. They are to die for!!< /Review>

Decent amount of parking lot of outdoor sitting space.the burritos that they sell are really big but they're not all meat it's filled with beans and rice this time around I ordered four tacos one of carne asada another of tripas another of carnitas and al pastor and to drink a cucumber water with lemon and spinach absolutely terrific drink. Relatively cheap and it came out really quick. The meat could have been a little bit fresher I noticed that they were cooking fresh meat and they gave me some that was already in the heater the tortillas were really good and they gave me extra salt so last time they didn't.< /review>

Mexican food at its finest! It’s a great change from all the Alberto variants in the world and they focus more on taste rather than quantity.

You definitely get what you pay for and the prices are not that different from any restaurant you would go to sit down at. You get the high quality Mexican food with very average prices.

Try the Al Pastor it is the best I have tried in the city. Definitely going back< /Text>

<text>Who waits for 33 minutes for their food! My family and I were hanging out inside and nobody told me that my food was going to be outside when I ordered inside. Worse customer service except for the lady in red which I’m assuming was the supervisor. She somehow was able to “make” my food in 3 minutes and wanted to offer me one taco for making me wait. Something doesn’t add up, but bottom line... unless you don’t value your time... don’t go!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Great place for authentic Mexican food. Coming from a hispanic family where everyone loves Mexican food, coming here does the job. The food is priced very reasonably to proportions and is made very quick. It’s a huge bonus that they use their own tortillas as well. I appreciate their efforts as well with conforming to changes due to Covid with subtle yet effective changes. The only reason I did not rate it a 5 star would be consistency in food preparation and overall cleanliness, but for me it doesn’t matter too much.< /text>

We order mix fajitas. The worse ever!!! The shrimp was over cooked the beef was burn is by far the worse fajitas ever!!   And also we order tacos. I don’t know what’s going on we ate there before many times.  The last time it was around March. Either new owner but am sure if they continue cooking this nasty food. They will be out of business</text>

Such a mix up waiting for our order. Probably won't return, 35 minute wait for 2 burritos. TWO burritos. 35 minute wait.  Not an apology or even acknowledgement for the long wait. 👎🏼</Text>

Used to give them 5 stars m but last 2 visits were terrible. With the increase of customers quality controll has taken a hit.1 found plastic in my burrito, the replacment meat was cold. 2nd my burrito tortilla was stail, probably from the night before causing to tear easly making it hard to eat and hold together.</review>

<rating>3< /rating><text>Been coming here ever since we moved into the area and we loved it. Large portions of good flavored food for reasonable price made them amazing value. But we've been noticing lately that they've been becoming more "corporate". Clean uniforms and visible managers is nice but the smaller portion sizes and blander flavors are not. One pound burrito feels closer to .75 pound now. I hope this trend stops. Fries used to fill the whole container and come with sour cream and guacamole. Now they are a thin single layer covering 3/4 of the thin side of the container and no sour cream and guacamole. Otherwise we'll need a new place.< /text>< pictures>

My favorite Mexican food in the IE. Lengua tacos, buche tacos, and hand-made tortillas were incredible! Definitely recommend this place to anyone asking for good Mexican food.< /review>

Delicious authentic Mexican food!!! I had the birria burrito and the meat was so tender and delicious! Very large menu with plenty of variety. The place can get a bit packed in the afternoons so morning time is best if you want to be in and out. Parking is limited and a very tight squeeze. Fast service and a large eating area inside and out.</Text>

I been eating at this place since 2017 now it is getting worst not once not twice. Lately it seems as if they always rush  every order especially if you order later in the night. The chicken is very dry and burned. The last time I was there we spoke with Ramon and I mentioned that I had bad experience in past such as leftover burned and dry chicken in my order. When you spend over $50 your order and you’re not satisfied it feels like a waste you money. I’ve always loved this place but lately I’ve been dissatisfied and disappointed every time. I want to keep coming back so please change or cook or stop burning the chicken.< /Text>

Foods good! It is a small taqueria so I didn't necessarily go in with very high expectations as far as the ambiance goes but overall I was satisfied with my experience and there's a good chance that I'd return for another birria burrito 😋< /text>

A friend took me there first time, food was delicious. I order grill steak plate, comes with hand made tortillas, fry beans,rice, salad, price it’s fair for the plate size. No table service though. Clean, you are able to see how they are cooking. Dining room is small but plenty of tables outdoor< /Review>

So awesome. Visited Viva Villa for the first time today, after having driven past it at least a hundred times. I regret every time I drove past it now.
Hot, fresh, fast, made to order deliciousness. Everything was outstanding. I can't wait to return to try more from the huge menu. I'm certain, everything is going to be fantastic. I'll be seriously looking forward to trying out many of the other items very soon!< /Review>

We ordered tacos and a burrito with NO flavor. Meat had no Flavor. Instead of having meat like a burrito should it was all onions and celantro. I tried to make it okay and just ignore it so I wanted to add some spice to it but they had NO spicy salas at all and all the sauces the had were all watery NO FLAVOR. We had to use about 10 little packs of salt just to TRY to get it some Flavor but didn’t work out. Also the napkins they have are so tiny you have to use SO MANY to wipe your fingers. If I can give this 0 stars I would. Don’t recommend. Never coming here again.</review>

<Review>Maybe miscommunication had something to do with it, but I asked for a veggie burrito. Waited 20-30 mins for it while others got their orders and while reviewing the receipt, they thought it was a shrimp burrito. I was in a rush to get back to work, I wasn't about to wait for another one. Hey, atleast they gave me a refund.</Review>< Resp>

I went last Sunday bought a menudo and it was great delicious but today I bought one at 7:15 a.m. The menudo was mixed with water cause water and grease doesn't mix it hardly had flavor. They either gave me the leftovers from some other day  or people bought their pans and finished it that they decided to add water  it was cleared so I know it wasn't menudo no more.  The tortillas were the best thing . The ladies don't have customers service and it looks like they hate working their.  Don't work there if you don't like it please<//review>

I found a long hair in my food, so I took it back. No apology nothing free, just a look like why didn't you just eat it..Its only hair..The night time cooks are good...Not the day cooks. I have been there a few times in the day...And it's never as good as the late night cook... But today was the last straw....Today, Is the last time I ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever go there..No stars from me for this place...<//Review>

First time visit...I had fajitas...steak...very tender,lots of veggies,hand made tortillas
Fresh guacamole,sour cream,salad was good...
Rice was ok but don't really eat it..I don't eat beans..Husband liked his tortas...he had 2...but the icing on the cake was the flan...Absolutely delicious..I've had good and bad and this was really good..flavor and texture..I bought an ext for my daughter at home...we don't live near here was just visiting a friend..
Glad for the recommendations...< /review>

I ordered a Torta De asada with a hair in it not by choice. Also I ordered 4 tacos de asada plain and the meat was burned. I cant believe this is the kind of service I received. When your restuarant model is Delicious and Fresh. This is so sad that I even have to send out a rating like this to make you guys aware of the service being received  at one of your establishment's.<//review>< Pics>

Always great food and service! Never had any complaint. Looking around inside everything always looks freshly cleaned. Even the bathrooms are clean. 👌👍✊ people say the red chili tastes like King Taco, but in my opinion it is WAY better.</text>

<Review>I come particularly for the outdoor taco stand they open up on weekend evenings. Roughly 8:30 pm until 2 am, gets pretty busy around midnight. Something about the outdoor grill makes the food even more delicious! Snack on some beans while you wait for your order, there is always a fresh pot. Great selection of salsa at the complementary salsa bar. Fast service, great selection and fresh food!< /Review>< Pics>

Great little hole in the wall. Food is good and prices are More than reasonable.  I will be honest, its like a trucker haven but they only add to the ambiance. In all, its all about the food and it's good.</text>

they need to rename it. the market is a thing of the past. the food is very good. a little on the greasy side. and like everywhere the prices keep going up. full restaurant prices for a market?   I expect a better atmosphere and full table service for for the amount increases.<//text>

My first time there with friends. I bought three burritos and there was hardly any meat, We were disappointed.

Strongly suggest to eat tacos instead< /review>

Used to be my favorite spot for burritos. The last couple times I have gone here and the burritos were not good. They used to do them right with the right amount of beans rice onions cilantro and meat but now they been serving it with fatty chunks of pastor and more cebolla frita then carne. Gross. I guess Cardena's makes the best burrito in town<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Sorry about the no picture but the burritos are good. I can only say burrito and al pastor because that's what I ate and really it's delicious. I've tried so many burritos and al pastor either to watery like a guisado or to much paste no flavor at all. But the al  pastor is perfect beyond. We also tried asada also wonderful their green Chile yum and the guac Chile as well. Will be returning again and just so you could know how good is it I live in LA.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

The high stars are people that haven't been to Mexico in years or ever.

Went to try this place and was surprised how busy it was about 9 a.m. I tried the menudo and 2 tacos. It was all delicious! It was a little pricey, $16 for the menudo, drink and 2 tacos. Overall though I was satisfied.<//text>

The food is very good. The service is not so great. I had tacos al pastor, it was delish. The salsas that are in the salsa bar are as those made by your abuelita.</text>

Went to try this place and was surprised how busy it was about 9 a.m. I tried the menudo and 2 tacos. It was all delicious! It was a little pricey, $16 for the menudo, drink and 2 tacos. Overall though I was satisfied.</text>

I know five stars seems like an overstatement, but I ended up with one of the best damn burritos (the Chili Verde) I've ever eaten in my life. For $9 and change, I rolled out of there stuffed and very, very happy! <3 <3 <3<//Text>

<review>I love this place. In fact I would go as far as saying they have the best sope's, torta's, and burrito's in town, and even outside of town for that matter.  It's a great place for street tacos as well, If you're coming from the club or a party this is the place to go too.  Don't even waste your time with king Taco.</review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Definitely the best tacos that I have had in Fontana. The al pastor is quite juicy and tender. The restaurant itself is very clean. There's high quality napkins, utensils and beans on the side.<//review>

My favorite taco spot In Fontana, the tortillas are hand made fresh everyday. The beans and green salsa are my favorite. You should definitely try the mulitas de asada. 😋<//review>

A lot of folks don't wanna hear that (like they didn't wanna hear that Beyonce deserved Video of the Ye...I digress), but it's the absolute truth. If you order carne asada tacos, and put the hot red salsa on them, and don't think this place completely embarrasses King Taco, then you have no taste buds. Period. Everything here is on point. Tacos, burritos, even the QUESADILLA is legit (tastes like jack cheese & cotilla, in a buttery freshly made tortilla). The churro is also fantastic. You know how some restaurants have a menu with 50+ items, but you have to make sure you order the right thing, or else it's not that great? This is not one of those places. Order whatever the hell you want. Seriously.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><name>Vaughn Dent</name>< Resp>

I just had some tacos here with a friend. They are open from 7am till up to 2:30a.m. some nights. This Place is also a market, Taqueria, and a Mexican food place. I didn't try the Mexican food place. But I guess at night the sell Tacos and Mulitas (unsure what that is but to my best guess its a taco sandwich with cheese) outside. Everything is cooked to order, They offer Five or six different meats including Asada, Al Pastor, Etc.They even have someone making the tortillas for the tacos right there. They Offer a variety of free salsa's, chilis, and other topping's for you tacos. Including a pot of beans. They do accept ATM. They have areas for you to sit and eat. Parking can be kind of tricky sometimes. They place is rather clean but they can work a little bit on keeping  wiping down the tables after people use them!< /Text>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>I just had some tacos here with a friend. They are open from 7am till up to 2:30a.m. some nights. This Place is also a market, Taqueria, and a Mexican food place. I didn't try the Mexican food place. But I guess at night the sell Tacos and Mulitas (unsure what that is but to my best guess its a taco sandwich with cheese) outside. Everything is cooked to order, They offer Five or six different meats including Asada, Al Pastor, Etc.They even have someone making the tortillas for the tacos right there. They Offer a variety of free salsa's, chilis, and other topping's for you tacos. Including a pot of beans. They do accept ATM. They have areas for you to sit and eat. Parking can be kind of tricky sometimes. They place is rather clean but they can work a little bit on keeping  wiping down the tables after people use them!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<text>(Translated by Google) It has history and the food is good, the only bad thing is that there are flies and you have to watch out for one on your plate but the tortillas and tacos, burritos, tortas are good.

(Translated by Google) I really like this place I work on the road whenever I come to California like here and very good service I really recommend it
What a pity that a few months ago I had a very good opinion of this place but today, March 9, I was around 7:30 pm and I even left a bad elaborate meal and another due to bad attention from who serves it as well as being rude to the public. I'm sorry but I can't recommend it more and neither do I think that it was one of my favorite places every time I come to California and I will find another where the public is better served if someone knows of another place with space for a truck let me know because I like it a lot the mexican food Thank you

(Original)
Me gusta mucho este lugar trabajo en la carretera siempre que vengo a California como aquí y muy buen servicio la verdad lo recomiendo
Que pena que hace unos meses tenía muy buena opinión de este lugar pero hoy 9 de marzo estuve alrededor de las 7:30 pm y hasta comida deje una mala elaborada y otra por mala atención de quién la sirve además de grosera a con el público lo siento pero no lo puedo recomendar más y tampoco pienso co el era uno de mis lugares preferidos cada ves que vengo a California ya encontrare otro donde se atienda mejor al público si alguien conoce de otro lugar con espacio para troca que me avise pues me gusta mucho la comida mexicana Gracias< /review>

(Translated by Google) Nothing to see this living villa with that of the sierra
The old meat tough and salty.
Al pastor's burrito was dripping with oil
The Cuban dis that barely a scraped of meat.
The food is very bad and old.
The food is nothing like that of the mountains, only the name they have.

(Original)
Nada que ver este viva villa con el de la sierra
La carne vieja dura y salada.
El burrito de al pastor chorreaba de aceite
La dis que cubana apenas una raspada de carne.
La comida bien mala y vieja no vuelvo.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Mmmm, they are not very good the tortilla is cold when they give you the tacos.
Too bad that a recognized tar place has that kind of service.
Hopefully and the manager will put the batteries in that ...

(Translated by Google) Whenever I come to Fontana I like to eat here but today is the last time they still know that we are in the midst of a pandemic and the food is to take away the restaurant is dirty many flies 🪰 around the food many people do not take social distancing seriously That's why we are as we are why they ignore the rules, the place is super full and a super dirty dump would look more uff than disgust with the flies 🤮🤮

(Original)
Siempre que vengo a Fontana me gustaba comer aquí pero hoy es la última vez aún que saben que estamos en plena pandemia y la comida es para llevar está sucio el restaurante muchas moscas 🪰 al rededor de la comida mucha gente no toman en serio el distanciamiento social por eso estamos como estamos por qué no hacen caso alas reglas súper lleno el lugar y un tiradero súper sucio deverian mas uff que asco con las moscas 🤮🤮< /text>

Everything delicious! And very kind everyone here !! Good prices very good variety and what can I tell you if hot stews and freshly made tortillas are for doubling the dish.

Too bad the small one hopefully one day they will improve it. They only serve it on the weekends and how often they have, a disappointment the very truth.
