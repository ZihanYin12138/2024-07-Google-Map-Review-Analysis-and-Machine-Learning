This place is great! Arturo was so helpful and honest, wonderful customer service throughout the whole experience.  I left my phone number with the girls at the front desk, with description of what I was looking for in a patio set.  You don’t expect to get such personal and attentive service from a liquidator. But a few weeks later, Arturo called me! Texted pictures of exactly the one I wanted!!! I ran down and purchased it, and paid for the reasonable and quick delivery, next day. He even had tested the fire table and sent me a video showing me how to light it. He also located a missing cushion(in a warehouse! Talk about dedication) and has the delivery guys bring it to me next day. I am happy with my purchase and their excellent customer service.</review>

<gmapID>0x80e84fe264cbf087:0x417374417d60aa6<//gmapID><review>My friend told me about Mars and I went to buy solar lights.  I was really impressed with the inventory and how helpful everyone was.  They went through the 5 boxes to be sure all 6 lights were complete. One box was missing lights and they found another box for me.  (All worked perfectly when I got them home,too).

I noticed an outdoor swing with a beautiful canvas canopy.  And even though they were already closed they showed it to me, sold it to me, and offered to deliver it Tuesday!   I never felt rushed.  Everyone is so nice there.

The driver called me at noon on Monday and said he could deliver it in 30 minutes if I wanted.  Then he was kind enough to bring it inside my gates to the front patio.  We had minimal set up, and the swing works beautifully.

Most liquidators don’t have the staffing to give you such good hands on service.  Mars is different and I’ll definitely be back regularly.< /review><time>1629815782079<//time>< name>

<Review>If you are looking for furniture, I recommend you ask for “Andrea”. We arrived to Mars looking for a specific sofa that they did not have. She located a sofa for us, in less than a week. I was very impressed by her dedication to find the sofa that we wanted, today we left with the sofa we wanted and a rug. Let her know I sent you!<//Review>< user>

There is nothing worse than getting ripped off....You shop these places for a deal since we are taking a risk that it works. No refunds! So they should offer a fair price<//Text>

Not ADA Accessable! There's handicapped parking and a ramp to enter the building, but the entire interior of the warehouse isn't wheelchair accessible. A lot of the outdoor space is the same. The parking situation isn't ideal. There's only about 10 parking spaces so you usually have to park in the neighborhood. Most items don't have listed pricing and some things are overpriced. Have google handy when you go so you make sure you're getting a fair price. The employees don't wear uniforms or name tags so it can be a bit difficult to find assistance for pricing. With that said, you can definitely find some gems here. We bought 2 kayaks here for $150 a piece. They were brand new and sell for about $650 each. One of them needed a small patch, but other than that, they were in perfect condition.< /Review>

The prices are similar to brand new products at a retail store and the lady that works there, who is always there won't haggle!

Shopping here is like shopping at a retail store without the benefits. You won't get your money back if the product is defective or you don't like it. Instead you are forced to exchange it for the same product or one of of equal value. If you can find something you want.< /text>

I"ve been a MARS customer for years now. The staff members are.      helpful, courteous, and there are always screamin deals to be had!  I no longer buy big ticket items at Costco, because I can find them all at MARS!  Thank you, Ted and Arturo for working so hard everyday to display great products and for your amazing customer service!  I totally appreciate you!!< /review>

If you want to be profiled for what they think you’ll pay then this is the place for you! I walked out after I purposely overheard a price quoted for an outdoor patio heater, waited and then asked and was quoted a completely different price after I was looked up and down.< /Review>

<review>Just purchased a vacuum cleaner and some outdoors lights, they work wonderfully! I always check here first before I go buy elsewhere and I always find the deal I want, very helpful Arthur and the girls at the front desk, someone is always there to answer your question its really a fun place to browse, reading some of these reviews that are negative I don't understand its very clear how they do business when you first walk in.
I will be going back to buy an outside umbrella, and see if Arthur is available to ask questions, that's all you have to do is ask!!< /review>< Time>

<name>Josh Segovia<//name><Text>Great stuff just overpriced on some aspects.  The lady in the back needs to learn proper pricing for products or she needs to get replaced. She prices things that are close to retail or more.  Things just pile up  and rarely seem to get sold they have better chance as selling things if they replaced her.    She gives discounts to her certain friends or clients  i noticed  id give this place more stars if she was gone.   From now on ill just go to bulldog liquidators. In camarillo. Where they priced things fairly  instead of like at dealetship that sells cars with no tags</Text>< pics>

So today Mars charged and promised delivery, which i paid extra for and someone is now saying they dont bring furniture inside which the delivery driver apologized...he was the only one to say sorry after promising delivery at 10-11,,,,its now 1pm and Mars just called saying for liability purposes they cannot bring things inside. Terrible customer service. I guess you get what you pay for!< /Review>

I just wanted to thank Ted and his crew for all that he did for the Thomas Fire victims. I'm late in writing this but he was so generous with myself and others. He continues to support our community in so many ways and always in a low key manner. Thanks Ted! By the way if you haven't visited his store you should go. Great merchandise at super prices! Truly an asset to the community in Ventura, California and surrounding areas.</review>

Used to love this place, could get good bargains on stuff. They are now just a complete rip off! Went in today looking for a kitchen faucet, it was $95.00. I told my husband I was sure it was cheaper at Costco so we went out to check. It was 59.00!!! Went back thinking they would lower their price...sh said they don't price match!!!!!! I just looked at her, it is the same faucet that you got from Costco as damaged or returned goods and you are charging $35.00 more then the new one!!!! I even showed her the picture of the price with the faucet-nope its $95.00, why wouldn't I just go buy new at Costco!!?? They had the big teddy bear also, $60.00 it was $29.00 at Costco, exact same bear!! These guys are practically thieves. DO NOT give them your money!!!!!< /Review>

This place is a junkyard. Want expensive, old, used and likely damaged items? Come here...Workers are rude and no help. Beware of prices, they like to sell items very close to retail if not more. This will give you a sense of the type of people that work here.....while the entire community was struggling and coming together due to the Thomas Fire in 12-2017, these people kept posting to Facebook asking people to come by to shop as if nothing was happening.

EDIT: Oddly, the moment I post something about the Thomas Fire, someone comes out with a review thanking them for it (5 months later)...devious at its finest.<//review>

Decent bargains, Coffee makers, rice cookers, electronics, suitcases, washers dryers, open box buys. You need to make sure you check to see if things work before you leave. I think items are only returnable for store credit. Some things look like used/returns, but over all I think there are pretty good bargains to be found. They do cater to Spanish speaking but I found that they do speak English and they are very helpful. The walkways are packed to the gills with inventory, stacks and stacks of boxes of items. I will definitely be shopping there again.< /review>

<review>I love this place!! Everytime I go, I always find something. Some items are obviously brand new, others have been opened so be sure to check that your item is operational.  It's a huge warehouse with everything from patio furniture, appliances, mattresses, coffee makers, vacuum cleaners, camping gear, fans...the list goes on and on. Their inventory is constantly changing so check back periodically if you're looking for something specific. Plus they have auctions. Get on their mailing list and you'll receive email notifications. If you're one who likes to search for deals, this is your place!!</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>Mars was recommended  to my husband and I so we went to see if they had any dinning room tables and chairs. When we got there we noticed that there were people randomly through out the warehouse. We couldn't tell who the staff was and who the customer's were. We found a couple of bar stools but no dinning room tables. Prices they were giving for certain items was just straight up ridiculous. Not sure that we will be going back as the customer service was bad. So word of advice , purchase at your own risk.</text>< pictures>

Vast inventory of everything ranging from Patio Furniture, Umbrellas, bicycles and appliances.  At very good and negotiable prices.  Very busy, lots of people shopping and buying.</Text>

Stuff broken allover the palce. Employees make up prices on the fly with no remote idea of the actual price of the item. You can spend hours piecing together an item only to be disappointed at the price you're given.<//review>

I've been coming here for about 4 years and every year it's declined. I bought a washer for $300 and it's broken. They don't accept returns, only exchange.  It's a long drive and not cheap. Only save $5 -$10 on my purchase compared to Costco.  Don't waste your time or money< /Review>

Customer service: Poor

Price: Cheap, but not super cheap

Store policy: No refund, all sales final

Quality of goods:  Majority of them are broken, you have to look for it. Those are recycled goods, so something is wrong with it.

Words of advice:  Check your item before buying.  Never assume it works.  If it is electronics, plug it in and see of all functions works.  Don't expect good customer service, it does not exist in this store.<//review>

While they have pretty much everything you could imagine (and about fifty of them) they were pretty rude to my mother and I and kept trying to tell us they didn't have the product which was listed on Craigslist almost as if it was because they didn't want to bother getting it for us from the back. Eventually they did, however, and made the sale. Sorta expensive too.</text>

< Review>
Beware of buying appliances. You take a huge risk because they’re not close outs or just blemished. But well used or damaged. Less than 90 days of light use and dryer broken. They will only pick up at driveway to see if they can fix it. So if you aren’t able to uninstall, carry out and reinstall yourself then
It becomes an expensive appliance after all is said and done when you have to hire people. I ended up hiring someone to fix the dryer and they pulled out a broken band and completely rusted out bar.< /Review>

<Review>Not coming back to this trash place ever had one of the worst shoping experience with the lady in charge of deciting prices on product. Last week i bought a suitcase for 25 dls today i found the exact same suitcase and now she wants 50 how does she come up with a 25 dls difference. Also her attitude of i you dont want it dont buy it but not only that she does not speak any english so dont bother to ask for help.< /Review><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Review>I am not buying anything here again they are sarcastic and rude and aren’t helpful at all we asked for a refund and they said they don’t give refunds only exchanges we had specifically asked them do you give us refunds if it doesn’t work they were like yeah well look we have a paper it was a tiny paper where if your a normal human being you will not see it cause t was busy people are blocking it we can’t see it. They said we would get money back we went back cause it didn’t work they told us that they don’t give cash back we told them that they said they would and after a lot of arguing we took the exchange cause at least we get something out of it. They told us it doesn’t make a noise and nothing will be wrong with it. Well they were wrong and they took forever to tell us anything and it wasn’t that busy. We got home and one it was dirty the previous one wasn’t  it had a noise and the tubes didn’t do and they said they would. Now if you want to buy anything here I wouldn’t this place is a mess and I can’t tell who works here and who doesn’t everything here is most likely broken and they try fixing it. 10/10 would not recommend that you buy anything they aren’t helpful and this place should be checked by the city cause it definitely isn’t up to code.

<date>1459378565450<//date><Rate>1</Rate><review>I've used Mars in the past and it was OK at best.  I went there the other day and purchased Patio furniture.  I was told by a manager that if I chose a set with in 30 minutes. We chose a set in 20 minutes, and were told delivery won't happen that day,  and it was rescheduled for Monday.

On Monday I called to confirm delivery and was told no drivers came in and that it will have to be trained rescheduled again.  I tried to explain that I worked the rest of the week during the day, and that it was guaranteed for Monday.  The lady became nasty and told me that she doesn't control the drivers and couldn't help me.

Due to the broken delivery promises (twice) and the rudeness of the staff, I will never shop here again.< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
Was recommended to purchase a car seat from mars since the were having a "sale" on them ($35). Got there and was told that the chairs that cost $35 were the display ones, that the ones in the box were $50 since they're brand new & the other ones since they are out in display, theyre dirty.
So i ended up buying the new one in a box, i got to the car and opened it to check it our... To my surprise the chair was NOT new, it had stains on the cloth & buckle.... Definitely NOT new, so we went back inside to let them know about it... It was a hussel to get a different one since their policy is "no returns". I was Not about to pay $50 for a dirty chair so i asked to talk to someone else, luckily they ended up exchanging it, after quite some time.
Defiantly NOT going back!<//Review>

I strongly recommend JBE Electronics and Appliances. Byron is a very sincere, honest and helpful gentleman. I had scheduled an appointment with Sears but after looking at the problem, I thought to myself this is something I can fix on my own and save money.  I called JBE and spoke to Byron to see if he had the part and shared with him I had scheduled an appointment with Sears. Unfortunately, he didn't have the part.  Instead Byron was very helpful and suggested I look for the part at another store and save money vs having Sears charge a large fee for a small part. Byron could of easily tried selling a new washer but he didn't. He understood its rough financially with our current situation and was very empathic in providing a less expensive solution. I truly appreciate his help. Even though I didn't buy anything, I ended that call with even something more valuable, Byron's words of HONESTY, SINCERITY, and HELPFULLNESS. May the Almighty Lord bless you in all you do!
Thank You!!!

I was talking to the owner about an appliance I was about to buy when I noticed something faulty. I asked him about it and he got very defensive. I got the feeling that he wasnt a trustworthy person and I ended up not finishing the sale. When you are spending $500+ on an item you should be able to ask questions, especially if they have to do with something that can affect the functionality of the item. I went to another appliance place and got a much better deal for what I was looking for. After reading the reviews here where others have said they bought defective items, I feel like I dodged a bullet.<//Text>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>SELLS BROKEN PRODUCTS, FLOODED GARAGE
My husband and I purchased a washing machine here a few days ago. We paid $300 for the machine, $40 for delivery and tipped $20 for delivery. We set it up and start a load of laundry before bed and get up about 8 hours later to a flooded garage. Upon calling the owner to get this sorted out he has my husband take it apart to determine the issue, they figure out what part is broken and the OWNER ADMITS TO IT BEING HIS FAULT. Instead of replacing it or coming to fix it, he has my husband go pick up the repair piece and fix it himself. So on top of the $360 we paid them, I’m looking at a hefty water and gas bill (it was hot water) and I had hundreds of dollars worth of items damaged/destroyed. It came with a 60 day warranty, which means nothing but to cover themselves after they sell you something broken.
Don’t be like me, read reviews! Upon reading their reviews before leaving this one I see MULTIPLE people have been sold faulty products from this place. Don’t gamble your money shopping here, go somewhere else.</Text>< userid>

<review>Recently brought a Samsung side by side refrigerator from Byron.  The customer service is outstanding. I brought the refrigerator, was delivered, set up and the water was working and making ice within one hour.  We were very impressed.  I try to always use local businesses . JBE definitely deserves the business.< /review>< user_id>

The daughter in the store was very friendly and helpful.  The owners came to our house promptly on delivery date and went above and beyond making my refrigerator fit into the spot I needed. I will definitely refer other customers and would not hesitate to use them again.  I also purchased a washer and dryer.  Excellent service.</Text>

Small business w/more older working appliances. I went in for an extra oven rack & found exactly what I was looking for & paid only $10. Idk if I necessarily would expect newer models, but for what they have the selection is decent.< /Text>

These people are great!!! I was in need of a quick fix or replacement dryer. JBE Electronics had plenty in stock and very reasonable prices. I was able to pick out a dryer and they delivered it to my house, installed it and tested it all within an hour!!! Free delivery and install within Moreno Valley, can’t beat that! Definitely coming back for other appliances and highly recommending them!! Thanks guys!< /review>

I had 2 appliances that were acting up on me and needed replacements and a fair and reasonable price. I found JBE APPLIANCES and was well pleased with their options and professionalism. Byron was very helpful in explaining to me what the difference in my options. they made me feel very comfortable in my search and even delivered to my home and hauled away my old stuff. Grade A experience. Highly recommended<//review>

GREAT VALUES ON USED REFRIGERATOR, WASHER, AND DRYER!
Amazing customer service by professional staff. Byron answered all of my questions and then delivered and installed my appliances the same day I bought them.
I bought a used full-size GE refrigerator ($350, 30"W X 30"D X 66"H) that was clean inside and out, a great buy despite two small dents on the right exterior wall.
I also bought a Kenmore washer ($300) and gas dryer ($300).  Each was 27" wide and 27" deep.  The washer was perfect, but the dryer had a bit of rust on the right side where enamel had been chipped.
After a month of looking at full-price new appliances, I was so relieved to find JBE.< /review>

I've purchased several appliances from these guys, and am so pleased each time. Excellent customer service and quality appliances at reasonable prices.  And, they back everything with a 60 day warranty!  Highly recommend<//Text>

<review>I am an older lady and I came to buy a washer that was simple to use and when I came to this store I was happy to see a lot of washers to choose from.The price was fair and because I live in Moreno Valley I was able to get free same day delivery. The two men showed me how to use my washer after they installed it. I definitely recommend them and when my dryer breaks down I will look to them first. Thanks again!<//review>< rating>

Cool spot. Good service! Bought a washer for my daughter. I felt it was a little overpriced but came with 60 day warranty,  so that was the determining factor for going ahead with the purchase. Great service call response too. I recommend!</review>

Great little used appliance shop, my washer broke down on me and I happened upon this little store in my desperate search to find something quickly and inexpensively. The young woman in the store was very helpful and knowledgeable about the different brands. I ended up purchasing a used washing machine and they were able to deliver and install it the same day. The two gentlemen that came out to install it we're very friendly and made sure it was operating correctly before they left (that it filled, washed, rinsed, and spun correctly). The machine I purchased was at the lowest price point offered but I am still very happy with it, you can see that it has been refurbished but for my use it is in an unseen area and as long as it is mechanically fine, and so far it seems to be, I can't complain at all about the price or service. If you are looking for an appliance in a pinch I would most definitely recommend this shop, I will be back the next time one of my home appliances breaks down :) and the best part is they hauled away my old broken washer at no charge!<//review>

They delivered within minutes of my purchase. They labored to remove my old fridge (had to remove front door even). They replaced my rugs and refused to even take a delivery fee when offered. Highly recommended.</Review>

Awesome service! They sell used appliances but look pretty good and clean! The prices were pretty fair and the employees were very informative and extremely helpful. Of course since the Appliances are used they don’t cover noises and dent and scratches but their warranty was pretty forward and on top I got free delivery and installation since it was here in moval. You’d think they’d charge the people that live practically on border line perris but they said as long as your address says Moreno Valley your delivery’s free. Will definitely be back in the future for more Appliances.</Text>

They sold me a defective washer. They offered to deliver another washer to me for a $50 charge. So I opted to have them fix the broken washer they sold me. Then the washer broke again and they told me there's nothing they can do for me. These people are absolute Crooks. Don't waste your time getting ripped off by them!!!!!</review>

I give this store a high 5. From the 1st time we came to the store, we were helped by Jailine. Very honest & sweet--- didnt sound like a salesperson  at all but just someone who helps you make an informed choice. The tandem of Rene & Bayron (father & son team) is superb...from the time of delivery...the quick response on some issues we encountered...all those helpful tips... They make you feel like, "hey, yeah, these are USED appliances & this is how you can make the MOST out of it" not like, hey, yeah, you bought one that is used, so what do you expect?!?  I say, WOW!< /text>

HORRRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!! Don’t go here. They don’t go by their warranty I bought a LOUDDDD noisy fridge they knew it was loud and didn’t tell me about it. They made it loud like that so they can charge me a fee to fix the noise and it doesn’t work. Looking at other reviews and I’m not the only one<//text>

< Review>
Horrible!!!! I was asked to describe my experience and that was the first thing that came to mind. I purchased a dryer from JBE located on Sunnymead in between Heacock and Backway right next to a small mom's and pop's taco shop. Cosmetic wise the dryer looks great, mechanically it's a disaster. I purchased it today 3/11/17 and immediately brought the problem to JBE/Byron's attention after being provided a 60 day warranty. Upon purchase the warranty was not honored because I was told that the problem was  cosmetic issue and not mechanical. After contacting multiple appliance mechanic's and explaining my issue with this dryer which has the most annoying squeaking noise that I've ever heard, they all said that it was a mechanical issue and it had nothing to do with cosmetics. JBE STILL DIDN'T HONOR THEIR WARRANTY. If there was a way to give a company zero star's I would. This was the most unpleasant and unsatisfying service I've ever received. The bottom line is that they suck and I would never recommend anyone to purchase anything from this company.<//Review>

Horrible.. I brought a refrigerator from them and immediately it begun leaking on the inside. I tried numerous of times to get in contact with them and they never responded.. Weeks later my refrigerator went out and i went into store the guy was rude and told me he couldn't do anything about it... I'll never go here or anywhere else that sales used appliances< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Terrible and too bad service and coordination, I bought a used refrigerator and they only gave two months of guarantee, days after two months it was ruined, I asked for their help, they were going to send a technician, we were on a schedule and I arrived much earlier for work reasons. I asked for minutes of time (15 minutes) and she did not want to wait, I explained to them that I have a year and a month old girl and I had milk to refrigerate for her that please wait but they still did not understand and Yano wanted to coordinate an immediate repair, service garbage do not buy in this store !!!!

(Original)
Pésimo y demasiado mal servicio y coordinación, compre un refrigerador usado y solo dieron dos meses de garantía, días después de dos meses se arruinó, les pedí ayuda disque iban a mandar un técnico quedamos en un horario y llego mucho antes por razones de trabajo le pedí minutos de tiempo (15 minutos) y no quiso esperar, les explique que tengo una niña de año y meses y tenía leche que refrigerar para ella que por favor esperara pero aún así no comprendieron y Yano quisieron coordinar una reparación inmediata, basura de servicio no compren en esta tienda!!!!< /review>

<Text>Update:

My appointment was at 9:00 AM and I showed up at 10:30 am, EXTREMELY LATE. When I asked him how long it would take, they said. “I do not know”. I figured it would take 2-3 maybe 4 hours to complete an hour job and decided to stay in Fresno (since home was an hour away and I had no ride).

It was my fault to assume that they would finish the job within a reasonable amount of time. If they would have told me, “we won't get to your car until the end of the day” or “please make an appointment for another day”, then I could have prepared myself. In this case, ended up stuck in Fresno for 7 hours.

I still stand by my statement of lack of communication. In this situation, from both of us. I should have told them I was from out of town and had to way back home and they should have clarified my options and the situation. By the time they were done, I had a clear, calm head and I was happy with my purchase. From a scale of 1 to 5, five being best, I give the product a 5 star and customer service a 1.

The cashier guy seemed friendlier and the price seems reasonable, so I will try again for my truck.< /Text><Response>None</Response>< Pictures>

<review>Outstanding customer service!  These guys did a perfect job on a difficult install.  They charged a more than fair price, and I know because I worked in car stereo for many years.  Skip every other jibrony stereo chop shop and just stop at CCS.  Solid.

<Text>Fabulous experience!  The speakers in my passenger door have been out for a while. Finally called yesterday afternoon and score, they were able to get me in this morning. Was all set to have the speakers replaced and went home to wait. Got a call less than an hour later, the problem wasn’t the speakers but the speaker mounting in the last installation (not them).  They had shifted in the door enough to that the solder joints were touching and shorting the system.  Lucky for me, just a little labor vs paying for new speakers, and I’m back in business.

The guys were quick, up front on my options, and honest - they could have gone ahead and replaced the speakers.  Heck, they could have fixed the wiring and charged me for speakers, not that they would have but I would not have known the difference. I will absolutely be recommending them to anyone that asks and will be going back if I need work in the future.  Made my day!</Text><gmapID>0x8094680009c4031f:0x3fc399217f69b09a</gmapID>< rate>

I recently moved to Fresno from Chicago and finally found a solid all-around car audio shop here in the Valley.

California Custom Stereo is the by far the best for all-around car technology, customer service and quality control for car audio systems. Paul, Gil and Robert showed me the ropes in the car audio game. Paul is greatly knowledgeable in the field of car audio electronics. Gil managed and made sure I got the sound system I was looking for the right price.

Recently, I bought a 2018 Honda Accord and had it fully-packaged with everything JL Audio.

Paul recommended I go with C5 set (front and back) from JL (tweeters and mid-range) two JL W6 12's w/ a JL 1200.1amp + 600x6 amp for the cabin speakers + JL Fix for the head unit. The whole set-up is filled crystal highs, outstanding mid-range w/ slamming powerful bass. This system is  full-on sensory experience like none other. They really worked with my budget.

I've been back multi-times for different areas of car needs and wants from the overall sound system, sound dampening to fog lights and alarms. CCS can do anything top-notch car related.

Much thanks to CCS.< /text>

This is the second car of mine that I've had Gilbert at California Custom Stereo install an anti theft alarm. He is very efficient, fast and he knows what he's talking about and doesn't try to oversell. Thanks to them I still have my cars.
Example: I was in a store shopping one day and my key fob let me know somebody was trying to get into my car. That's what I'm talking about this is the kind of device you need to have on your cars to make sure that they remain your cars. Thank you Gilbert and thank you California Custom Stereo.< /Text>

HIGHLY RECOMMEND
I moved From Boston to Fresno and when I starting asking around about car audio and where to get an installation done CCS was the first name I heard. I went in spoke with Paul and my install was scheduled and completed in a very fast manor. I have returned many times with questions and inquiries and ultimately another install. Everyone at the shop is always professional, knowledgeable, upbeat, and just happy to explain or make suggestions if needed.<//review>

Quality equipment. I've been coming here for over a decade. They really know their stuff. Ask for Gilbert if you ever need professional advice. The prices are just too expensive, but the installation and customer service are worth it.</Text>

<review>THE BEST GUYS to go to in Fresno for any car sound system. I have a c5 Corvette and they installed all new speakers, with an amp, and stealth sub. All the work done was very quality, and the car sounds stellar. It was at quite an affordable price and I had my car back within a few days. Definitely will be a repeat customer for any other sound systems I need.</review>< pictures>

<Text>I came in looking to purchase some door speakers. The price on the speaker said $169.99. I told them I wanted them and they asked if I wanted them installed. I told them I was doing it myself and all of a sudden the price was $199.99. I told them no I wanted the price on the wall at the speaker and they said “ ok $179.99” I walked out the door. If your getting the items installed you should be ok, but otherwise they will try and change the price on you. One other thing. Don’t look for a disabled parking spot because there is not one.<//Text></record>

California custom stereo is by far the best stereo shop I've been to. The customer service is superior, I believe they are honest, and they're good at what they do. I had them fix a mess another shop in town caused. Their prices are reasonable and their work is always timely. I won't take my car anywhere else. I highly recommend them!< /Text>

Called before I went in yesterday and talked to employee Paul who also installed my alarm on my 04 trailblazer. Got great customer service and was help instantly after coming in. Even got to watch a great movie while I waited. Called later and even got a great price on another vehicle. Will be back several times and highly recommend.<//review>

They did a great job installing it and took the time to teach me how everything works!!

Very competent crew, excellent equipment and good service was what I experienced during my visit. I had an unusual install and it proceeded well. They did the install that my local dealer would not could not. If you wish radar detector, custom stereo, computer custom stereo, these are the guys. Not necessarily the cheapest but the best never is< /text>

I came in today to get the DVD player in my car fixed and Paul was so helpful and more than willing to repair it for me even though it wasn't installed there. They were really busy but he managed to fit me in, even without an appointment, and he even charged me less than what he quoted me. I would definitely recommend California Custum Stereo to anyone; very professional and accommodating.</review>

I've been going to another stereo shop for years, but over time their customer service has gone downhill. I stopped here by chance to ask a question about a problem I was having with my system. Instantly they came right out to my truck and looked it over, they were able to find out the issue, informed me what needed to be done and had it fixed within the hour. Their knowledge and customer service is second to none. I will be going back for all future needs as well as have friends and co workers switch from the previous shop to the crew at California  Custom Stereo. Job well done gentlemen.< /Review>

The second time I used this business was for some major work need to be done on my RV. Everything was done just right .

<text>I can't thank these guys enough. I had taken my car to three shops thinking the reason my car wouldn't start sometimes was due to aftermarket accessories I put in and no one could find out what was wrong. I took it California Custom Stereo and they found out that I had corroded battery cables and whoever had the car before me had just twisted the wires together instead of soldering them. The anxiety and headache of my car not starting was driving me crazy. I would definitely recommend going to them, they were so helpful!< /text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1534443141315, 'text': 'THANK YOU for giving us the opportunity to take care of the issue you had, Glad it was resolved.. thank you'}< /Resp>< GmapID>

<review>I had California Custom Stereo install the Viper alarm 5704V with all the bells and whistles about three years ago on my Silverado 4x4 truck. They did an excellent job! It worked perfectly and was a clean install. I was having a problem with my Smart Start on my phone last week. I made an appointment to solve my problem. On Tuesday, Paul worked with me for half an hour to solve the problem. He even called  Viper directly to solve it. Paul got it fixed! He was very courteous and to my surprise, he didn't charge me. I would highly recommend California Custom Stereo for your alarm and audio needs.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><date>1499970757861<//date><gmapID>0x8094680009c4031f:0x3fc399217f69b09a</gmapID><Rating>5< /Rating>< Resp>

Had them install power windows in my 1998 2-door RAV4. Reasonably priced and top notch workmanship. The windows work smoothly, no rattles or other problems. Thanks!<//Review>

I really appreciate these guys. I messed up the after market alarm on my 2013 Tacoma. I called to see if they could help (they do all the alarm installation and repair for CarMax, where I'd purchased the vehicle two years ago) and was told to bring it by. It could probably be fixed, but they are full service if it needs replacing. I pulled in. Although they were busy, Paul came out to look at the truck. He spotted the problem, fixed it and told me to remember them in the future. I highly recommend these people.</text>

Went there n there were two brand new z370. They installed pioneer navigation system almost like factory made. Fit perfectly there, it's amazing how they just do perfect , clean job unlike many other stereo shops around. They integrate BMW, Mercedes , rangerovers and almost all cars. I took my z350 to install a navigation system. And I think the job they did is even better than the factory. ;)</Review>

I called California Custom Stereo to see how much it would cost to uninstall my factory alarm on my car because I wanted to find out what was draining my battery. I talked to Paul and he said it would only take a minute to uninstall it and that he would do it free of charge. At first I thought he was trying to play me for a fool but this guy went out of his way to help me and even checked my battery to see if it was good or not. Wow! Talkin' about good customer service! If I ever am looking for a new sound system, this place will be my first stop! Thanks again for the help Paul!</text>

<Text>Bought an expensive head unit from Paul @ CCS. Had a lot of trouble getting it to interface with an older factory amp. All I can say here is that Paul has been infinitely patient and supportive throughout the whole process. Every time i've had an issue, Paul hasnt hesitated to do what it took to get it taken care of...even more than 10 months after resolving the last issue. Wouldnt hesitate to do business here again or advise anyone to do the same. GREAT shop.< /Text>< pictures>

California Custom first and foremost far exceeded my expectations for my Trucks build. Their craftsmanship combined with the heavy weight JL audio everything from amps to components and just “1” w7 12” absolutely dumps.... cleanest sound I’ve heard in a really long time. No distortion at max volume.  Going anywhere else in Fresno for Your stereo needs would be a mistake....

I recently found this shop and had to pay a visit.. i was interested in a new deck so paul one the worker showed me all the different models and explaind all the pros/cons for my preference and style of phone. We settled on one of the new pioneer avh 1300 nex with apple car play and android auto. O have fallen in love with his unit.. affordable and great quality. The install was on a rainy day and they made us feel more than comfortable at the shop while he installed it.. with slight modification to make it fit, the finished poduct looks as if it could have came stock.. couldnt have been happier with the results and service.. if you are looking for quality service and products, stop by on north blackstone and check them out</text>

i wanted to get a whole system done for my 2011 dodge challenger, subs stereo amp the whole nine yards.... i shopped around and decieded to go with a diffrent shop in town (BIGGG MISTAKE!) i left the shop feeling good about it and i ran into nothing but issues after issues. i took it back to the other shop and refused to fix the problem finally i got to set up an appt and still i it was just another issue. so i went back to custom stereo and they fixed my problem and left satisfied with the job they did on my car, and still till this day no issues. I ended up paying the amount twice but lesson learned should have gone with custom stereo to begin with :)</review>

<review>Avoid doing business with this dealership at all cost! They have zero interest in customers, let alone loyal customers and care only about the bottom dollar. Dishonest and misleading service and information...all focused on their profits. If you are set on a Chevy, strongly recommend taking your business to ANY other dealership than this one.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Great dealership with a helpful staff. I worked with Glenn at the location to work a great deal on a truck I was looking all around for. I went to many different dealerships none that wanted to wheel and deal.

At McConnell they are there to wheel and deal and close the sale and make it a pleasant experience the whole time.< /Review>

I purchased a 2017 Chevy Volt from McConnell  Chevy, I think Dec. 2020.
I’m 5’11” , this is the most “fitting” car I’ve ever owned. I just drive it to New Mexico ... I am beyond pleased by how it  drives, gas mileage, every thing about it.
I liked my Prius ... I love the Volt!
Thanks guys.</review>

I am most pleased with the treatment I receive at McConnell Chevrolet. Marty, the service manager, is truly outstanding. He works with you concerning any problem you might have until it is favorably resolved. He spends time meeting with the customer and understanding the issue from the customer's standpoint as well as fully answering any questions. Really like having a dealership like this close to home for a long ongoing positive relationship. Highly recommend.< /text>

< Review>
My truck was missing and had a service engine light on.  It was diagnosed as a bad injector on no 6 cylinder.   I authorized repair after i was assured this was not covered by warrenty.   I recieved my truck back late friday  April 30th.  We left for home early the next morning.  We noticed a strong exaust smell at times shortly after we got on the road.   I stopped  later that morning leaving the engine running.   Thats when I realized that there was a exaust leak.   Also the engine does not run smooth.   I have since foujnd the letter informing me that the warrenty is eztended to ten years and  110,000 mile on the injectors.  This would have shown up when the Vin no was entered.   I also feel  was overcharged by at least double what the charge should have been.   $3,500 to change one injector and not do it right when it should have been done under warrenty?  I have a appointment with my local dealer to haveit fixed right at your expense and also have notified chevrolet customer
assistance center.<//Review>

Prompt communication, friendly and trusting staff from management (Bill) to sales (Marshall), quick document processing and financing (began the process via email a few days before and would recommend doing the same to save time), reasonable prices and negotiating flexibility - - - an overall great experience!

Got myself a rare Juke Nismo RS without much trouble and would certainly recommend them to other prospective car buyers!<//Review>

First time buyers from McConnell.  We'll be buying from them again.

Great sales TEAM; watched them actually help each other.  How refreshing!

Finance team was quick, efficient and helpful. Saved us some interest on the car loan. We appreciated that!

Husband bought some protection for the paint on the car.  The detailing team phoned us to set the appointment.  Great follow through!  We didn't have to call and we loved that!

The guys stayed late so we could drive our new wheels home that night.  We felt badly they missed dinner - but we were sure pleased they stayed!

Great place to buy a car.</review>

Surface of a carnal is excellent no complaint as far as trying to buy a car there turn and run you have a better opportunity at CarMax yes my credit was challenging and there was a couple of there's one thing that upset me was my car was not only totaled but the bank that they dealt with you would not talk to a person they would call and leave a message and wait for a call back what kind of lender is that one that needs to stay on the east coast is the one I think they need to stay away from so a week later I still don't have a car and my credit was ran 35 times< /Text>

This is THE WORST service center I have ever dealt with. IF you happen to get someone to answer the phone, count yourself lucky! But don't get too excited. They'll transfer you to someone who won't answer their phone . . . no matter how many messages or texts you send. Then you'll repeat the process . . . over and over and over and NO ONE will care. Last week I took my car in to have it serviced, and after an entire day without a car I CALLED THEM to ask when I could come pick it up. They told me that they hadn't done any work to it because they needed to order some new parts. So the car sat there . . . ALL DAY. . . . and no one let me know that I could have come and got it, saving me an entire day without a car. Today I dropped the car off again (parts came in) after explicitly detailing on the phone how I'd need a service car for the day. Guess what?! No one made note of that detail. No car again. I've called probably 15 times today and NOT ONCE have I gotten a phone call back, or been transferred to someone who answers the phone. Voicemail after voicemail and ZERO customer service. AVOID THIS PLACE. YOU DO NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH THEM.<//Review>

I want to start off by apologizing for your recent visit at our establishment. I understand your frustrations! We are in the process of acquiring new, yet experienced staff to handle the phone system, making the appointment scheduling an easier, more efficient process for our customers, as well as getting in direct contact with the service advisor. A new system is being implemented for the advisor's to help aid them in getting in touch with their customers quicker, and making sure no one falls through the cracks. While that is definitely not an excuse for the service you've encountered, it is the reality for the short time being.\nI really appreciate the time you've taken to fill out the review to express your experience and voice your concerns. It helps open my eyes to where I need to focus more of my attention in order to make it a better experience not only for you, but for all who visit McConnell.\nAs an extension of my gratitude for your visit, and also part of the apology, I would like to offer you a free detail on your vehicle to use at your discretion. Whenever you want to schedule for your detail, or your next service visit, feel free to call and ask for me directly. If I am unavailable at the time, feel free to email me at mat_mccoy@mcconnellchevy.com, and I will make sure you are taken care of. If you need ANYTHING, feel free to use me as your primary contact. I will be more than happy to help in any way that I can. Email is always the best way to contact me. My emails get sent to my phone, so if I am out of office, I can still reply.\nAgain, I apologize for your experience, and I hope that you will give us another chance at keeping you as a customer. I plan on making many positive changes to not only make a more efficient place of business, but also very customer friendly.\n\nThank you for your time and business!\n\nMat McCoy\nService Manager McConnell Chevrolet/Chrysler\nContact: 707-433-3384"}<//resp><gmap_id>0x808410c6ddc9990d:0x30711c8b080ba2e2<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Had to take my Dodge in for a warranty inspection, so I figured I'd have them assess a sound I've been hearing. I've never paid more than $20 for an estimate before--$126 just for them to diagnose a relatively straightforward repair. My $ is particularly valuable right now, and I'm taking it somewhere else.<//Text>< name>

Save yourself the hassle, their service department has the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Took my car to get a headlight repaired 2 weeks ago. Yesterday I had a coworker tell me I was driving with no headlights on, sure enough my headlights are both out. I tried calling to tell them about it. My first phone call was a lady telling me they could get me an appointment in 2 days. So I am supposed to drive to work (at 5am) with no headlights and drive with my two young children in the car with no headlights for 2 1/2 days. I told her they needed to take care of it sooner., she said I could bring it by today but she didn't know if it would get worked on. So I told her I need a loaner then because I can't just drop my car off and have nothing for transportation. She says she will have me talk to Jose, the service manager, about it. She comes back on the line saying he is with a customer and will call me back shortly. I have them 2 hours and called back, I was then transferred to his voicemail where I left him a message and still have not got a call back 8 hrs later. I've tried calling 2 more times just to get transferred to a recording that says the person I am trying to reach is unavailable and to hold for options, I hold and the there's another recording that says the extension doesn't exist. Beyond frustrated with this place. Do not expect any kind of help from them. Take your business elsewhere.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

My camper is being worked on they already quoted me a price for double the labor that the book calls for not excited they told me 4 hrs and they'll start at after lunch I'm surprising them in the morning to see what works actually been done I'm not going to be surprised if none at all I walked by a few times never seen my hood up or anyone working on it . I Christ when asked about switching from my old amp based  system to a newer volt system because I don't want to run into the same problem and the technician thought that meant putting a voltmeter in ! what a schmuck ! It's a 78 dodge. 440 it's dodges flagship engine !!!! Dodge should be embarrassed for these guys they figured out how to fix the problem almost half a century ago ! The power wire for my ignition burned up you replace the pickup on the distributor because that's where the initial failure happened ,  the brain because it's old as dirt  and the wire because it burned And test for continuity it's not rocket science  I'm a certified ICAR auto collision repair expert you guys aren't the only people with Mitchell on demand I know how to use quoting software too it's a glorified tune up ! stop scratching your heads and get to work !< /Text>

Absolutely the worst service ever! Bought A brand new 2012 Chevy duramax 2500 truck from them. Have been in to their shop over 10 times! Every time they don’t have a car for me, their service tech gets sick, they lose a part and it sits for weeks with out anyone working on it.  All things that have been under warranty.  No one returns calls in a timely fashion. Only one person seem to know anything about where your car is, and there not in today!
Don’t get any work done here.
I like to keep business LOCAL but costumer service and repair shop is that bad go somewhere else.</review>

We telephoned and Daniella (sp?) sent us email directions. We arrived and were immediately greeted by Roberto and Eric. We sat inside and visited on the couch. Talked of travels and such. Saw the car. Quick test drive. Filled out an online names and numbers form. Got on the wifi and sent info from the car buying service/finance department. We compared notes on our experiences with USAA. Then visited with compliance. They delivered the car and we got back on the road. Messrs Sierra, Prothro, and Kosta are true men of service.
Being in the service is rewarding. These men made our day and now our next decade of service is a path that is assured decent and reliable transportation. My dear father often said, "Food, clothing, transportation, shelter and medicine." These are important basics that all should know how to access. The men and women of McConnell CDJR have earned a good and decent reputation. Years ago our dad purchased a 1972 C-10 and we have fond memories of visiting McConnell in Costa Mesa just down the road from FEDCO. Bless you all. Smiles,

Louise shaking is really great and has to be one of the best take out places in Chino Hills and Chino and anywhere else. Will you always take out the family specials, and when I 1st tried it out, they had really good selections for the menu. The Caesar salad wrap was really great. Almost everything there is great as well . Most of all it is family run and there are extremely and wonderfully nice.<//text>

My husband and I love the salads.  Chinese chicken salad for me,  Cobb salad for him.   Also the cucumber and tomato salad is very refreshing.  The chicken wrap is my other go to item.   We've been enjoying Louise's for well over the last 10 years, when Louie and Marie were still the owners (RIP Louie💓)</Text>

Food is great but the manager the man is a complete jerk! He is disrespectful as heck by the comments he makes, and I will never go back. His wife is wonderful and super nice I would strongly suggest you talk to your husband about his customer service skills. I will never go back or recommend this place to my worst enemy and will not give this place a penny of my money again!< /Text>

<Review>I usually come in for soup, but it's not worth it to me anymore if I take the chance being served by the husband who is rude and needs work on his customer service skills. I will find another local business to support.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I would give no stars if it was an option. Food was okay at best customer service was horrible!! Right before ordering the waiter behind the cash register said may zi help you. As soon as my wife st arted to order he got a call on cell phone and proceeded to talk for a few minutes making us wait. My wife then ordered finally and as she was getting her change he answered the phone again. He gave her the wrong change and continued to talk on the phone. She asked twice fir the correct change. He was off by a penny which isn't a lot but he just ignored my wife. Another employee came from the back. We asjed her fir the correct change and she said she will nit help us we must talk to the original guy who is still on the phone. Anyway food was finally shoved in our face and the correct change rudely given with no thanks ir anything.<//text>

Crummy staff, the pizza is pretty good it's cheap, they accept EBT, the place is kind of dirty, it's what you would expect in the neighborhood it's in and for the price you're paying. The pizza was cold and there was a dead bird in the doorway.</review>

<text>The only reason I'm giving the third is because they are open until like 5am conveniently.  It's kind of disorganized in appearance, kind of like my desk would be. Location for me is great, but for a visitor this isn't the greatest part of town. The pizza is OK,  the burgers are better. The desserts are the grocery store pre-made frozen aisle cakes, not saying that is bad because I like a lot of those cakes, just informing you.</text></record></dataset><record>

<text>This is the type of review I thoroughly enjoy giving. I had ordered for pick up and after arriving home, there were a couple of mistakes in our order. They did not offer a credit or a refund in the charge. Instead they went above and beyond by replacing the missing items and sending the delivery driver out to our apartment which is most definitely outside their delivery radius. This - and the delicious food - is why I have been and will continue to patronize this restaurant. Flying colors all the way!< /text>< gmapID>

I had been on the west coast for two weeks I was starving for a good home-cooked meal and I walked by supremos Pizza, and wanted spaghetti and meatballs.it took about 15 minutes for them to prepare it the only thing is that the meatballs taste sort of like mushrooms. The garlic bread was delightful it was a great meal for $12 to $15 . The garlic bread was about to die for.<//review>

I waited two hours for my order to be delivered  and then when I finally got it the cheesesteak was gross I didn’t get my garlic fries and I paid extra with the extra ranch that paid extra for and instead they threw in some really gross and cold stiff mozzarella sticks and gave me a Mountain Dew when I ordered orange soda which was also gross it would’ve been nice if they at least called to ask what I would like instead instead of assuming. Now my stomach hurts and I only had two bites because I was hungry and didn’t care that the food was nasty.What a waste of $30.<//review>

<review>Horrible service by both Grubhub and Supremo Pizza!!!!!!
1. Grub hub driver was extremely late and the food was cold.
2. Food did not contain chicken tenders like I had ordered.

I wasted $20.37 on a meal during this pandemic and when I called Supremo Pizza, the company spokes guy responded in a nonchalant manner stating "there was nothing that he can do". Horrible service.Horrible food. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.< /review><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>Tim Ryan<//user_name><time>1573820324959</time><Rate>1<//Rate><review>It could've and would've EASILY been 5 stars considering how hungry I was in the wee hours of the morning.  It wouldn't have take much at all.  The pizza was in a "warmer" and sold by the slice.  I wasn't taken aback that the gentleman working there seemed a little grumpy, considering he had probably been working all night.  His demeanor easily could've been written off as a bad night, but the fact that he slid a cold slice of pizza towards me not even attempting to warm it up, and when I mentioned his cold pizza, he threw it in the microwave for about 2 minutes, which made his fairly decent pizza (i'm sure) soft and soggy, was certainly a deterrent from getting the slice to go that I was planning on taking for my lunch break. Food quality aside, which was only sub par because of his lack of interest in serving a quality product at this time, this dude was straight up RUDE to nearly every person that walked in the door of his business.  It is clear this guy doesn't appreciate the business and probably shouldn't even have a business where he deals with people.  He won't get my business ever again, not at 4am or any other time..</review>< pics>

<Text>Firstly, I ordered delivery from GrubHub. Estimated delivery time was 25 minutes, but it actually didn't arrive until 1 hour, 45 minutes later. When I called to ask them if the order was on it's way a little over an hour after the order was placed, they said it should arrive in 5 minutes max - but it took an additional 40 minutes.

The pizza wasn't hot, but it was decent enough. I would have awarded 3 Stars if not for the following.. Tl;Dr: Never trust a restaurant that doesn't know the difference between cake and pie.

The chocolate cake I ordered was, in fact, pie. As a cake lover who usually passes on pie altogether, I was very disappointed with the discovery.

Please note the menu reads only "Chocolate Cake," with no description. So I called Supremo Pizza to suggest they change their menu to accurately reflect the nature of this dessert... a chocolate cream pie... so others in the future don't make the mistake. I wish I had recorded the conversation, because it was ridiculous.

Me: "Hi! I just ordered delivery, and I wanted to let you know the chocolate cake listed on your menu is actually chocolate cream pie."
Supremo: "How do you know it's not cake?"
Me: "... There's no cake in the dessert. It's chocolate cream pie."
Supremo: "How do you know it's called chocolate cream pie?"
Me: "Because I've had both cake and pie before, and this is pie."

He then proceeded to argue with me that the dessert was cake, simply due to the fact the supplier labels it cake on the box. So I described to him what makes a pie a pie, and what makes a cake a cake, and he still argued with me.

I had to remind him multiple times I wasn't calling for anything but to suggest they just change their menu listing to pie! Or at least add a description of the dessert - a chocolate cookie crust filled with chocolate mousse and topped with cool whip. (i.e. not cake... if we want to get really specific, it more closely resembles the definition of a tart, an open-faced pastry crust with filling.)

Overall, he was just quite rude to me, and all I was suggesting was a change of a word on their menu. At the end he offered to give me more cake for free with my next order. BUT IT'S NOT CAKE. DO NOT WANT. Literally just wanted a "Oops sorry about that, we'll fix our menu to better reflect the item."

But I got no apology, no assurance they'd correct their menu, nothing - but they did blame their supplier for labeling it wrong, which tells me no one there is able to discern the difference between cake and pie without someone telling them so. And also blamed me, for apparently not being happy with the "cake" they sent me.

I've included pictures of the "cake" Supremo sent me, and the images when you search Google for "Chocolate Cream Pie" and "Chocolate Cake." It's very, very obviously, Chocolate Cream Pie.

GOOD DAY SIR.< /Text>< GmapID>

The last few times food was horrible. I just ordered pizza and wings. To say I’m disappointed in the food is an understatement. Wings are fatty and pizza extra pasty but both cold. I work around the corner so the food should not be cold and the sodas are not what I ordered plus they’re hot< /review>

Only gave 1 Star because 0 was not an option.  Was at San Francisco General Hospital and placed an order.  1st off ordered Diet Pepsi and got regular,  2nd off Ordered the Chicken Fingers and Fries with Ranch sauce and they sent BBQ sauce, 3rd off ordered 7 meatballs with cheese and sauce and they didn't bother including any utensils.< /Review>

Always out of Veggie Slices and does not make new ones on request. My cheese slice (since vegetarian) had sausage baked in on the side since they make half-half pizzas. Don’t go here as a vegetarian.</text>

Decent pizza, but on the thicker side. Crust is not too flavorful. Service is good, but all in all nothing special. Open very late.<//review>

<Review>We ordered pizza. It was completely burned. We tried calling them and offered to send them a picture of the burnt pizza but they just kept hanging up on me and my daughter. They cursed us out and called us liars. We will never order from these people again.< /Review><userid>117728695052905321691<//userid><Rate>1<//Rate><time>1519702128746</time></record>

Our pizza never actually arrived. The restaurant CANCELLED our order without even telling us, 2,5 HOURS after we ordered. We were supposed to get our pizza at 8:30 pm and at almost 10pm they sent an email saying the order was cancelled without any explanation. Wouldn't answer our calls. Worst experience ever. Had 4 kids waiting for pizza who never got any dinner. AVOID!!!< /review>

<review>This place wasted my time. I had a movie I was enjoying and so I wanted to eat as I was watching it. I order a simple salad and a cheeseburger using gubhub. The eta was for a hour. I ended up waiting a hour and a half before I called to check on the order which the man who picked up was unaware of any of the details of my order.

I then waited another 30 min before I had grubhub called to check on the details. So as I was chatting with grubhub I notice that they marked it as delivered which was not true.

When gubhub finally got done communicating with them they said due to me checking on the order the canceled it. Wow excuse me like it's my fault it's  your company lack of comuncation. So instead of finishing the order they PRIDFUL self cancled .. .

THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR GREAT SERVICE!!!!!!  👌💯 just beware don't piss them off you might just get this wonderful service.2<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Don't eat here. Indian guy wearing sweatpants was the first clue it was going to be bad. He seriously served us a fountain drink with no ice no cap no straw. There was a bunch of white oily stuff floating to the top of the soda and the pizza was definitely a couple days old.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>DO NOT ORDER PIZZA FROM HERE!!!!

Let me first start by saying I work in the service industry and have really high standards for service. Eat24 and Ryan the customer service rep that I spoke to was wonderful and exceeded my expectations.

Everything was going wrong with my order. I ordered 10 pizzas for my staff of 30+ people. Their lunches are 45 min. and assigned ahead of time with the first lunches starting at 12pm and going until 2pm. I thought I would have plenty of time to get my pizza by the noon lunches as I ordered at 10:40 am. Even chose a different pizza place than I usually order from as it was one of the few that had delivery that early. It said expected delivery would be 30-45 min but I soon after got a text saying the restaurant confirmed delivery time of 12:10pm. Not ideal but I was ok with that timing.

I went outside at 12:00 to wait curbside for the driver with a cart. At 12:25 was when I first did an online chat with I think her name was Adel from Eat24. She called the restaurant for me and confirmed the driver was on his way. She also gave me a discount because I had to wait. She said the driver was in traffic and the restaurant was busy and they apologized for the delay saying he would be here soon.

Next I contacted Eat24 again at 1:00pm and this time spoke to Ryan and explained the situation. At this point my staff that had been promised lunches had to either not eat or buy their own food. My boss was upset and I had a large department full of employees that were disappointed. For most people in my department paying rent is a struggle and most are working 2-3 jobs, so you can imagine getting free lunch is a really nice thing for them. Ryan called the restaurant for me again and again they said that the restaurant told them the driver was stuck in traffic (there wasn't over an hour of traffic for the usual 10 min drive) and would be her in 10- 15 mins.

The lunch ended up not arriving until 1:30pm and the pizza was barely warm. The driver was apologetic and said traffic was bad because the Tunnel was closed. Afterwards I verified online that the tunnel was indeed open. According to google maps with traffic the longest route would have been 18 mins. I felt lied to and felt like I let down my employees. The one good thing of this entire experience was my interactions with EAT24. They were with me throughout every step of the way and even called me to follow up after the food was delivered. At which point they got my feedback that I didn't feel like the discount I was given earlier was enough to make up for the experience and service I received from the pizza place. Ryan was proactive and called the owner of the pizza place to see what more he could do for me. Honestly I felt like the pizza place should have done more to make up for their terrible service and outright lies but Eat24 did all they could for me and I will continue to be a supporter of Eat24 and tell friends and family to use it as well. Eat 24 is honest, reliable, and supportive service even when everything else seems to be going wrong. It is a wonderful app with great customer service reps.

Thank you for making this terrible day better for me.

< Review>
This was one of the nastiest pizzas I've ever had . The delivery the man yelling over the phone .
This pizzi is one , no make that the WORST pizza I've had in my life .
Honestly. I am a San franciso native PEOPLE PLEASE DONT YOU WILL REGRET .
matter of fact I'm calling the better business bureau because after an hour and forty five mins and being one block away they deliver me the grossest nastiest pizzas ever
And when I called the man started yelling at me and wouldn't bring a hot pizza
So 20$ for two root beers .
Cause that's all that was good

Really cool hole in the wall bar, the music is great! And the vive there is pretty chill! But ladies please be careful when going there, the bar tender likes to take pictures and videos of ladies dancing....(Fyi Its not a Guy....) It becomes uncomfortable when its done more than once.< /text>

Other patrons = friendly and mind their own business. Age group 30-50.
Drinks = cheap
Food = Nice
They have a pool table, darts and a jukebox.
The place looks shady but the people are nice and sweet. Smoking is allowed inside.
During the SuperBowl they had a lot of free food and they gave out 2 Jersey’s to the lucky draw winners. Overall its a great place to grab a beer if you live nearby.<//text>< date>

Discreet hole in the wall dive bar.  Showed up for some beers on Sunday evening but left after obnoxious karaoke took hold.  Great people and atmosphere.</review>

<text>Careful who you talk to because some people can't hold their alcohol here and will start with their BS 😣😒. I came 2 nights in a row and both nights something happened 🤦. The staff is really cool and the ambience (aside from the drama) is cool. A little smokey so if you have breathing problems I'd suggest you skip this spot.</text><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

It's a whole in the wall type bar. The beer selection is minimal, but good place to go if you want to casually hangout with friends. Would not recommend if you don't like the smell of cigarette smoke on your clothes when you leave the place.< /Text>

Hole in the wall bar that serves beer and soju (Korean rice "wine"). Has a pool table and darts for entertainment. Be aware though, they allow smoking inside.</text>

<Review>Good price and great service! I had them do some major engine work and they where way less expensive than the dealer, I think they where more honest too. They also did a smog for me in about 20 minutes.</Review>< Resp>

<user>101056910502948282690<//user><Text>A few years ago I took my car to get smogged here. I had just replaced the battery (which will autofail the smog test) and took it here to get smogged without realizing the situation. Before the test started I told the mechanic what had happened. He knew that it would fail the test, and still completed it anyways. I don't really understand this logic, as he could've charged me a 10 dollar advice fee or something and I would've come back to this shop, where they would've gotten the same amount of money. I have no doubt they are capable mechanics, but since that experience I can not recommend them as I can not trust them. Seem to focus on making an immediate dollar at all costs over keeping a customer due to proximity to Isla Vista.< /Text>< GmapID>

I come here regularly for oil changes and smog checks. Never a problem, always fast service, and family owned/managed. Recommended them to the company I work for and now even the retired boss comes here for regular maintenance. Definitely the spot to go to in goleta for whatever your car troubles.< /Review>

Do not take your car here. These people scammed me when i came in for a smog check. They charged me to tell me my car had failed the check and then tried to charge me more to tell me what the problem was. I took my car to another auto shop afterwards, it passed the smog check, and they charged me less. Go to Fernando’s Smog Check instead, he is extremely knowledgeable and treats you like a human being as opposed to a paycheck.<//Text>

Dropped in with no appointment to get a smog. My car would not restart. KaDon greatest me warmly. He had a man on it before I sat down.
They were able to hav my battery delivered quickly. Had to run monitors for smog. With great advise I was out the door. 30 minutes later back with monitors ready to go. Passed smog and away I went.
Casey’s team is great. See them for oil changes, tune ups, brake work etc
They are fair and honest<//review>

<text>BEWARE! DO NOT GET SMOGGED HERE! They DO NOT do free retests. They WILL NOT ask you any questions about recent service done to your car which could cause it to fail the smog test. THEY WANT YOU TO FAIL SO YOU HAVE TO PAY THEM A SECOND TIME TO GET RETESTED. TOTAL RIP OFF.

Instead, go to KENNEDY'S SUPER VALUE SMOG down by Milpas Street. They are about $15 cheaper and give you FREE RETESTS for two weeks!! I've been using them for years and love them. Should never have tried Casey's simply because the location was more convenient.</text>< Rating>

They caused 3500 in damages. This is the second car & 3rd repair theyve screwed up. Someone is getting sued!</Review>< rating>

Had to get my smog last minute for the DMV. Thanks to Casey’s I ran into the dmv, got my number, drove a few blocks down and got my smog ASAP! Ran back to DMV and made it in time to register my vehicle. Thanks for the quick and hassle free service. Would recommend!<//Review>

I visited Casey's because my door handle fell off and I needed a new windshield. The dealership quoted me at $700 (300 for door handle and 400 for windshield) but Casey's Garage charged $489 for both. They were done with repairs within a few hours and were very polite. Service was great and lower prices than dealership.</Review>

I have always come here for my smog. It's a dirty garage with a worn down waiting room, but they do a great job and I always get good service. Shortly before Halloween I got a smog and came back to a few fun-size candies in a bag with a note saying, "You passed smog!" It's all about the little things!</review>

< review>
After getting my catalytic converter replaced, I drove 50 miles as instructed by a wonderful muffler shop in Oxnard. I came in to Casey’s yo get my car smogged, and they went through the entire smog process and charged me, and then they told me that my car wasn’t smog-ready because some of the readiness monitors hadn’t reset. This was information they had readily available by plugging into the OBDII (which they did do prior to the test), but went through the process, they failed me and made me come back to re-smog.
I told one of the guys “if the car wasn’t smog-ready, why didn’t you tell me at the beginning before going through the process?”
And then he put the issue back on me by saying “if you had told me that you’d just had the catalytic converter replaced this wouldn’t have happened.” Then they sent me away asking me to come the next day.
I came back the next day and they passed me and charged me again. Happy that my car is smogged, but I can’t afford to be jipped. This whole interaction undermined trust.</review>

This is the worst garage in town with the most unprofessional customer service.  They lied about the work necessary, over-charged for the minor work that was done, and hung up on me during a conversation.  We ended up filing a legal claim against them and winning a judgement for the repair costs, legal/court costs.  I advise you to stay clear of this establishment.</Text>

The guy who answers the phone is so rude and nasty. I called to see if they found out why my check engine light came in and they said they were working on it right now and would call me back very soon. I waited hours before calling back to see if they had determined the problem. The man was so hostile and accused me of only calling 15 minutes earlier. It had been hours, and even if it had been 15 minutes I have every right to call as much as I want to see what is happening to my car. This place is horrible, and nothing could ever make me return there.</Review>

Little did I know the diesel inspection doesn't include running the vehicle at all, so it's even less work than for a gas vehicle.

They charged me double for something that was half as much work than normal that I also asked about in advance.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Not sure if it's in their culture to be rude. But damn! Took my car there and they said a small piece of plastic that attached to a hose was broken and my car failed. So I took it to my mechanic and he said it was very suspicious how that piece was broken and in the spot it was broken in. He never seen that and if he had to guess it was broken by hand. I think these bastards are crooks and when you walk into their shop you get that feeling like they are gonna rip you off. Never go there again!!</text><user>103019581332579197691< /user>< Rating>

<Review>Rude. Went in to have a vehicle smogged and ended up doing a presmog. Which they charged 25$ when the sign clearly stated 20$. The excuse was that it was a large vehicle. However being rude and telling me that the answer to my question of can you repair it so that it will pass was...

"Not without further testing and it will be too expensive for you."

It's funny how do they know what is or isn't in my budget. This is all after telling at 8am that the only person who could do it wouldn't be in until ten. I came back at ten and the man I spoke to at 8am was the man to do it.

Wouldn't sent anyone here unless they really like being treated badly.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Rating>1</Rating><pics>None< /pics><text>The worst. Reccomend avoiding, because your taking a strong risk they will try and scam you. Been here twice for smogs and some of the employees are terrible with customer service. Always one word answers, reluctance to fully explain things or problems, unfriendly. On the most recent test they full on swindled me because i had a check engine light on, and instead of honestly telling me that it wouldnt pass bc of the light on, they ran it anyways, failed, charged me and said id have to pay again for the recheck after getting the light off. When i brought up the issue with a manager after the recheck he only argued with me and tried to make up poor excuses for his technician just not even being honest in the first place. So yes they offer the cheapest smog test, but make sure ahead of time you're car is in perfect shape and will pass the first time, or they may look to pull the same move they did on me.  You're much better off going to another place that has quality service and will do a free retest. I also want to add that similar experiences have happened to both my parents.<//text>< Time>

{'time': 1587673849772, 'text': 'Graylan, we’ve contacted you several times to resolve all the issues you’ve brought up in this review. It seems like you’re not happy about your parking spot being moved which we feel may have prompted this review. When going through construction, things get delayed, changes get made, weather doesn’t permit work – these are all factors that contribute to deadlines not being met. We’re sincerely regretful that construction took as long as it did. Your building was the 6th building to get remodeled out of 18. Your building was completed February 25th 2019. Construction is now completely done, which means you won’t have to worry about any construction near your car. The paint drop was wiped off immediately, leaving no permanent mark or damage; and as for the scratch, Ruth has sent multiple emails trying to resolve the matter, which we have yet to get a response from you. We’ve also asked for documentation of your girlfriends’ injury, which might be subjected to an accommodation for a closer parking spot but again, we have not received anything from you as of today. You’ve taken to Google and Facebook to complain about things that we can’t resolve unless you work with us by providing documentation. Give us a call if you’d like to discuss this matter further.  We are happy to submit a work order to get issues addressed inside your apartment and patio areas. We don’t know of issues like this unless you bring them to our attention. Please call us today so we can hopefully resolve your frustrations 916-726-6300.'}</resp>

I am absolutely appalled with my experience at Salishan. I’ve lived here for almost two years and I’m at my breaking point of dealing with this complex. Keep in mind, I try to be as flexible and reasonable as possible, but the experience I’ve had here is undoubtedly uncalled for. When my girlfriend and I were looking at moving here, we were told the “two story” gym would be finished and accessible by our move-in date in July of 2018. The gym finished just this month (March of 2020) and it’s not two stories. We were also told during construction that our apartment would be done with the remodel by September of 2018, but it started in September of 2018 and went through the end of the year (although still seemingly unfinished). Before we moved in, we were sold on our apartment having a parking spot in front of it and Salishan gave us a letter about a week ago giving a two day notice to change parking spots in a way that would “suit everyone much better than before.” They ended up moving our spot much further away and around the corner where I can’t see it. It’s making it tough on my girlfriend with a back injury now. I feel extremely uncomfortable with our spot moving so far away considering I’ve had paint drop on my car when they were painting our parking spot covers and I have had construction lay equipment and wood way too close to my car and in my spot (I got a huge deep scratch on my car that same day as well coincidentally). There would be days that my car was so covered in sawdust, I couldn’t even see out the window. I was told a while ago that there would be a way for us to get compensation for our negative experience once construction was over, but nothing has materialized yet. I frankly don’t even know for sure if construction has finished on our apartment since there are multiple nails still sticking out on our patio and the light outside of our apartment door is still not functional. An officer came to our door one day to let me know that someone was sleeping on our stairway to our apartment, which made us feel extremely uncomfortable as well since it gets so dark without that light. When I called Salishan to get the specific issue of my parking spot sorted out, none of the employees were able to do anything except for Ruth apparently. I called Salishan six times trying to reach Ruth and spoke to someone every one of those calls checking on when Ruth would be available, only to hear by the 6th call that she was going to be in meetings all day. On that 6th call, I was also told by one of the employees that I’m “just venting at this point.” I reached out via email to resolve the parking situation and will update my review accordingly based on what happens from here. I’ve lived in multiple apartment complexes throughout the years and have never had any problems or an experience even close to as negative as this. The night that everyone got the letter about our parking spot changes, I talked to about 6 other residents and everyone I spoke to truly felt miserable living here. Save yourself the hassle and don’t give Salishan your consideration. It would be a disservice to recommend anyone to live here after the multiple lies, inconveniences, and simple lack of care.< /Text>

I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Salishan Apartments.  The grounds and amenities are great and its very pet friendly.  The maintenance staff is quick to respond to requests and the office staff is professional, friendly, and great communicators.  They have navigated this pandemic with grace and understanding...especially since some of the properties amenities had to stay closed for much of 2020.

If you are looking for a place to live that is pet friendly, affordable, has courteous neighbors, and a management/maintenance staff that takes care of you and cares about the property they steward....I recommend Salishan Apartments.< /Review>

This review is only for Charles, the leasing manager.

My mom and I toured Salishan Apts looking for a one bedroom and Charles was the leasing manager that showed us around. He was so professional, friendly and helpful. He was so patient even in answering my mom's questions, some of which were redundant and a little negative.

He really shone though afterwards when we didn't rent with them but had created a free, online account in order to apply and wanted to delete this account. I called the office over a week later to do this. He had the best attitude with no hint of annoyance, he just wanted to help solve my problem even though it wasn't his problem and he easily could have brushed me off! Above and beyond he goes, such an excellent representative of his company! I would hire him in a heartbeat if I was in a position to.

Charles, people like you are GOLD so know how valuable you are! You have the best attitude, are genuine and live from your heart. Those characteristics cannot be taught or put on a resume! It has been my pleasure to interact with you during this transaction!</text>

Where to start?
Our experience here has been amazing! The manager Ruth is a doll! She is always willing to listen and assist in anyway she can she made our move a breeze!
Once we moved in, we did have a little trouble with our AC, but that was immediately addressed and fixed with not only Ruth but also with Nick one of the amazing maintenance techs here at the property.
I really can’t say anything bad about this company or the property, our experience has really been a great one. I would recommend living here in a heart beat.</Text>

< review>
I've lived here just under a year now and am very happy, especially as a dog owner.  The best part is the maintenance crew, in particular Nick, Jerry and Cheng (sp).   Recently I had an emergency, and the response was very fast,  professionally handled and the crew was respectful and worked around my schedule (I work from home).   Compared to other places I've lived (including the East Coast), the work orders get taken care of a lot quicker and more efficiently (even on Sundays).  When I have had to call the office Ruth has been forthcoming and gotten most everything done that I ask for. I love the trees in the neighborhood, there have been a lot of improvements lately, and overall I am very pleased with the quality of life here.  Highlighting again that Nick, Jerry and Cheng are the best!  The "little things" that happen during holidays, and now a yard sale are more than I've ever seen happen in other neighborhoods in the past.  It definitely adds a touch of togetherness and community.< /review>

STOP! THIS is where you’re next apartment should be. My Wife and I spent months looking at EVERY apartment complex in Folsom, Roseville, Carmichael, Orangevale and Citrus Heights. Salishan Apartments we’re the ONLY one that had a great mix of amenities, activities, and all for great pricing. The first thing that we enjoyed about the apartments are the grounds themselves. There’s an extremely nice river walk with a fountain and a little dog park for our dogs. This was top priority for us as we wanted a nice place our dogs could get out and enjoy every day. The next thing we were happy to see was the package room. Any packages you get from Amazon or anywhere else will be stored safely in a locker that only you call have access to via an app. It’s so cool! I no longer have to worry about packages being left on my doorstep for hours or days at a time for anyone to steal. Salishan also has quite an amazing Gym with all kinds of really nice and clean equipment for working out with. There are 2 pools, a spa, and a fire pit area which are really nice too. The units themselves are quite spacious. And they come with a washer and dryer IN UNIT! Yes! They also come with fire places which is really cool too. They even tell you during the tour through the unit that they have no problem with you wall mounting your tv or putting up shelving, etc and that they won’t charge you a fee against your deposit when you move out for it…who does that?! That’s awesome! The patio that you get is really spacious and enough for a table and chairs if you like to sit outside and enjoy yourself or have a meal.

Perhaps my favorite thing about the apartments though is the fact that the apartments don’t just take your rent each month and let things around the complex fall apart. They are constantly reinvesting money into the upkeep and upgrading of the complex. They’ve quickly taken care of trees that needed to be removed due to storms or damage. But they didn’t just remove them, they quickly replanted a bunch of new trees throughout the apartments. They’ve also upgraded the mailboxes with some nice new mailboxes. Right now, they are adding in some sidewalks and redoing curbing around the complex. It’s just super nice to see the place constantly improving. They care about the way the apartments look and it shows.

Finally, I have to mention the awesome staff. Ruth and her team are awesome. Maintenance is constantly going around and checking on things and are quick to respond to requests. They’re all super nice and a pleasure to speak with. And everyone in the office is super nice and a pleasure to work with as well. They work hard to keep everything running smooth and it shows.

Salishan Apartments is the first apartment complex where it truly feels like a community and a place that is really enjoyable to call home. You’ll really enjoy living here as much as my wife and I do, I promise! Thank you to everyone who works at Salishan Apartments for helping us call this place home!< /text>

I’ve lived here for 8+ years and am very happy with my apartment and the management here. Maintenance answers requests in a prompt manner, the staff always smile and say hi and the grounds are nicely maintained.</Review>

<Text>My husband and I moved here in October 2019. This year, because of COVID-19, our family was hit hard financially when my husband and I were both laid off from our jobs. Salishan worked with us on a new payment date to make up the rent we couldn’t pay in March because of the job loss and let us pay a day late in October after my husband had gotten a new job, but his pay date ended up on the 4th of the month.

During this holiday season they have tried to keep up our communities spirits by holding Holiday contests, having Santa come through the community on a carriage and dropping off a gift of fudge which included a “Golden Ticket” for our specific apartment & gave us a gift card. It was very nice and unexpected.

Our work with the staff has been professional and fast. We’re grateful to still be living here.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Date>1608175578685<//Date></record></dataset><record>

Ruth is the most unprofessional and disrespectful manager I’ve seen in my life. She can’t count till 4, she sabotages, she never calls back. She always asks about “documents” even if you already provided everything they asked before. And the “most perfect” thing in that performance is she will never let you know if she decline your application, she will not even send you an email or a message. You just accidentally go to their website and see the unit you applied for is on the market. Spent my time and money for nothing. Would never recommend this complex.</text>
<Response>{'time': 1582829838386, 'text': 'Artem, it is our understanding that you did provide documentation. However, it was insufficient documentation and we reached out several times requesting additional information. We explained why we needed the additional information, at which time you indicated that you would provide it, but we didn’t hear back from you. Our Leasing Consultant called to inform you of our final application decision, which you did not answer, therefore she left you a voicemail. I think you’re right; we should have followed up with an email as well. We wish there were something more we could have done for your situation and we apologize that you had to find out the way that you did.'}<//Response>< Gmap_id>

I absolutely loved living here. The complex is very well maintained and beautiful! The maintenance staff is always around, extremely friendly, and was always very prompt when called. The women in the office are incredible. My roommates ran out on the bill, literally leaving me with an empty apartment and rent coming up in a week. The women in the office were so extremely helpful. They were very understanding and went through all of my options with me to make it as painless as possible. I would absolutely recommend this complex to anyone looking. The apartments are very nice, spacious, and the bathroom was HUGE! I truly wish I could have stayed at this wonderful apartment complex and would recommend it to anyone who is looking.< /text>

Too good to be true. Shady business. 3 years total. No compensation for construction and loss of amenities while they hike the rent up. Numerous problems, scary problems in here and then they tell us that we can't renew our lease. SHADY SHADY SHADY they turned out to be. They won't notify you of things if they can get away with it. Horrible experience it turned out to be. I honestly wrote half of the problems and it wouldnt let me type anymore. Lease at your own risk!<//Text>

I lived here for one year and I'm shocked at some of the negative reviews I read. The staff is great and has accomadated every request I made...timely and resolved completely. Ruth is extremely pleasant, approachable, and professional. I've seen her interaction with others and she's always been friendly and considerate. The grounds are clean, manicured, and very nice to walk the dog or just an evening stroll. The complex is undergoing construction so additional noise and traffic is expected...but the renovations and upgrades are much nicer and worth the temporary issues. Rent is a little high but given the ammenaties, responsive staff, security, and location proximity to stores, highway, and restaurants I think it's a great place to live.<//text>

This complex is a joke. We were harassed by others and the complex did nothing to help us because they stated they had no proof. We moved into this unit for 6 months and were fooled by the nicest management. But never again. I would never recommend anyone move into this complex. They will take you for all the money you have and then some when you move out. They stated in our moveout notice that they had to replace the carpet due to extensive wear and tear and stains. Mind you we did not even wear our shoes in the house and I deep cleaned the apartment before we left but they are still charging us. There were numerous broken tiles and maintenance needs but none were solved while we lived there. To top it off the construction is non stop and causes flat tires because the construction crew does not clean up after themselves. There is also no place to park after 5 pm so don’t even think about leaving. The spots are small and many people park over the line making it impossible to park in your reserved spot. There are also cars that sat in the parking lot the whole time we lived there obviously broken down or abandoned and they never got towed or removed which took spots from us. The walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors conversations like they are in the room with you. This company just wants to charge you for the money they are putting into the outside construction job. You basically can’t even live in these units without being charged. Look elsewhere. This place is garbage since the new company took over. Don’t let the cosmetic changes fool you! Almost everything in my unit had damage or problems.</text>

We offered to remove the tile and replace it with new vinyl, you declined and said it was not that big of a deal and that you would only be here for 6 months. We understood and notated that on your file. We understand that you do not agree with your move out charges. We have provided you written documentation by a professional carpet cleaner that your carpet was heavily soiled with urine. We have pictures with black light showing this in multiple areas of your apartment. I understand you do not want to owe anything and that you did your best to deodorize the carpet but the carpet was damaged and must be replaced. If you remember, we had to replace your carpet the first time you lived here due to urine as well. Of course we will work with you if you need to make payment arrangements.

< Review>
The customer service here is the BOMB. They offer a military discount and keep in touch with customers while they're still trying to move there. Even while being in a different state, Andrea was an amazing rep that I've spoken to and she's helped me feel so comfortable about moving there and meeting all my needs. I haven't moved there yet but I am so excited to and feel very confident with the new place I'm about to call home. Honestly, request to speak with Andrea, she's very sweet and informative and also keeps in touch and she calls back!!! She doesn't leave you hanging or make you feel forgotten if she's ever had to call me back she does within an hour and its so nice to deal with a management who cares about their customers!< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Was in a tricky situation when another apartment situation decided it was prudent to lie about the move in cost among other things all the while playing semantic games about availability. Anyway the end of the month was fast approaching. I had a week to get find a place, see it, get approved, all that bollocks.
In came Nikki to save the day and situation. She took an interest in getting me in despite of all the red tape and communication hassles associated with renting in California. She took the time to show me all the available floor plans in person and to actually take me to the units rather than showing an idealized and inaccurate "model" apartment or even worse, pictures. The best part was the fact she answered all my questions and had the place ready.
The overall vibe of Salishan is as good as it gets for someone new to the community. Always a crew of people making sure the grounds look good, no litter about and actual parking spaces near my unit. My last place I had to practically hail a cab to my car it was so far away- not fun after a days work. It was a real team effort to get me in despite typical paperwork issues (on my part) as I am used to a simpler process back East where I am from.
There were a couple minor issues (sticky bedroom lock and slightly clogged bathroom sink). I let Nikki know and the next day Nick and his associate from maintenance fixed the issues and were great conversation. Also, the buildings numbers are not particularly well displayed, but a map is given to new tenants.
I've rented many places coast to coast and Salishan stands out. Everything works and is in optimal condition in the unit. I look forward to the events and warmer weather where I can use the many amenities like Basketball Courts and Tennis. Meanwhile I can use the indoor fitness center and Racquetball court.
My first few nights I slept very well, which is a good sign for those who travel a lot. It's very quiet and tucked away from the main roads with no trains honking at all hours like the first place I almost moved to.< /review>< Pictures>

< review>
So it was great when we first decided to move in March. The staff remains to be amazing and the maintenance is great too. This is nothing against them at all. The issue is that 3 months in, we get a notice telling us that we won't be able to use our patio for a minimum of 2 months. This is a huge problem for us because apart from having a washer and dryer in the units, the porch was a major factor in picking our apartment. The porch allows my dog to be happier because she loves to be outside, and she can use the bathroom on a patch of grass when she needs to. I already struggle with having a million things to do in the morning for my health(I have Cystic Fibrosis), and that made things easier for me too so I don't have to worry about giving her morning walks on days that I work early. This is also confusing my dog because she already won't use the grass inside as she keeps trying to out on the porch to use the bathroom. She is known to have accidents inside when she can't go outside. I don't want our carpets to get stained either. They are also telling us that it will be very loud from 8-5 every day for the next few months due to the "renovations." So much for a quiet and peaceful environment to live in. Once again, due to my health, there are days I need extra sleep, so if this impairs on that, that is a huge issue. Lastly, while it isn't as big of a deal, the paint scheme they chose to change things to is absolutely hideous. Think of colors used in a Dr. Seuss book. So the cottage feel I loved about this place will be gone. As far as the patio goes, they need to reduce the rent until they can be used again, because we aren't getting what we are paying for. I'm pretty livid at this point.

Update: When we moved in the apartments had boarded patios. Now they changed it to railing, yet the first floor is still boarded. Since then, the owner has refused to allow us who live on the second floor to put up privacy screens. How is that fair? You can completely see through the windows, not to mention I don't like being seen when I want to enjoy being on the patio. I want a reasonable amount of privacy. Salishan claims to offer a relaxing and welcoming atmosphere, so why not stay true to your mission statement? Additionally, my dog tends to stick half of her body out and she could easily fall through. This is also about the safety of my dog. When we moved in, we were told that to prevent our animals from going through gaps, we were allowed to put up chicken wire. Ruth has been great in trying to mediate for us. However, I am not sure that the owners actually care enough about their tenants to listen or take anything into consideration. We pay to live here. I also don't think they care about the fact that their tenants are now paying for a product they did not agree to when the lease was signed. We would not have decided to move in here if we had known this was going to happen. Owners, please make it right. I might actually want to stay here if you do. At this rate, we are considering leaving when our lease is up as this has been the worst living experience we have ever had. Thank you.</review>

Zero customer service. They don't care about current tenants only the next best tenant that they want to move out so they can charge more. Do not move here you will not feel safe for what you pay and the staff only care about your rent check.</text>

Literally go find someone else to rent before you get stuck here. I've only been here for 1 year and a half and they have increased my rent for a 1 bedroom apartment over 20% since then. What started out at 1020/ mo (not including the water fee) has turned into 1250/ mo (not including the water fee). The only nice thing I have to say is I love the repairman (Nick, I think). Since we moved in I've struggled with the lack of security and inoperable gates, our vehicle has been broken into TWICE, the constant noise coming from loud music at the bar and the parties hosted in the childrens park area. You could find way better for the price and hopefully you won't get charged for a false sense of security. I think down the street there are some nice apartments across from a residential place (not a bar/cemetery/low income housing) if you do chose to rent here my suggestion is to increase your insurance coverage so when your windows get smashed in at least someone (obviously not the salishans) will help.

Update10/29/17

If you are still debating whether to rent here, I hope this helps to advise you otherwise. If you’ve read my original review and the vague response from management I’m here to give you an update on how well they are working to fix the issues. The front gate hasn’t been able to close for over a month in that time we’ve had other windows being smashed in and glass on the parking lot, homeless that are sleeping in the park at night, and holes in the metal fence. The security concerns are not taken seriously, maybe because they don’t live here at night but the rest of us do. It’s not safe to walk around with how many lights that are out and have been out for at least 6 months. You know it’s bad when the mail package doors are always hanging by a thread because of criminals ripping the open. Hopefully this helps you to decide to rent elsewhere; my hopes is to either convince you to find a safer place for your money or to actually get a fundamental plan from the management about how they are going to resolve the issues. Why would the residents care who you are teaming up with to solve the problems? It’s not working and your dodging the issue, you’d make a great politician but not manager.<//text>

I'm not sure this place is getting bad reviews. I've read some of them, and I can definitely tell you this. The management and maintenance have been nothing but respectful, prompt and helpful. I call or walk over to the office with a problem, knowing it will be handled ASAP. All the staff are great! I am a current resident here, and the only people I've ever seen complain are people who were rude and impatient. So as far as the reviewers go, I obviously don't know how their experience was here but I'm willing to bet, it was troubled people who were bad residents and we're treated as such. I can honestly say, I love this apartment complex and I hopefully will be staying another year!</Text>

<user>118120760125061757193<//user><rating>1< /rating><Text>This is a HORRIBLE apartment complex to live in.  First of all they raise the rent over $500 when your lease is up to get you to leave.  They also take away your entire deposit and have no reason why.  The property is poorly taken care of.  They don't have gates that close so there are constantly bums coming in and searching through the trash cans.  They took over three months to get back my deposit check which is illegal.  The manager refuses to return my calls and blames it all on corporate.  They act like they are an apartment community that is well taken care of but really they are in a ghetto area and over charge when really they have poor service, crime, and don't care about their residence.

PS- Read the reviews below and see how Brandy the apartment manager tries to address everyone's concerns.  They don't care about a single resident here.  Listen to me when I tell you that Salishan is a DUMP.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Make sure you guys do a walk thru with their employee before you move in and before your lease is up when you decide to leave. If you do not request  a walk thru before vacating, they will take your whole deposit (e.g. $1,000) for replacing old carpets that needed to be replaced anyways. Worst place to live ever. Even if they decided the carpets were "clean" before moving in, at least mail the summary of charges to our new address. After 10 months of nothing in the mail, we had to contact them to inquire about our deposit.</Review>

Peoples idea of clean probably isn't accurate. in my experience its quiet, clean and the office people are respectful to me because I am respectful to them. and as far as the bums going in the dumpsters, YES that is sooo frustrating seeing people go through my trash along with other peoples when we work hard for our living and for a safe place to live. but they can't control that. its rare at I'm out after 9pm but if I am I see paladin driving around which I personally appreciate. apartment complex's will never be perfect but I've had nothing but good experiences here.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1486684750037, 'text': 'Thanks for giving us an honest review.

I've lived here for almost a year and have been treated with nothing but kind, professional help from all of the office staff. The only time I ever had to call maintenance (due to heavy rains, there was some minor flooding at the base of the steps to my apartment) they were prompt and they fully fixed the issue. The office also contacted me to offer a better covered space as they had a closer one become available. All areas of the complex are well-kept at all times, the leaves are cleared away in the Fall and the grass is green in the summer. I have had some issues with there being dog poop in the grass, but I don't think this reflects poorly on the apartment complex because they have free doggie bags set up at every grassy area for the owner's use - there is only so much they can do! It is a very pet-friendly apartment, which I love and the other tenants have all been kind and relatively friendly. I would definitely recommend this complex.</text></record>

All the power outlets in our apartment were loose, all the plugs for our TV’s, laptops, etc had to be bent so they would stay in. Even though the community is gated, vagrants are digging through the trash in the middle of the day and the middle of the night. The gym has two treadmills and two elliptical machines, twice the treadmills stopped while I was at a fast pace damn near hyperextending my knee as the belt just stopped. They had invested in re-landscaping and used some plants that attract bees, so we have limited the walks with the dog and kids.
After about a month we noticed the stains resurfacing in the carpet, the oven and drier were of deteriorated quality, taking a very long time to heat up and dry. A few months after we moved in, the dog park out front was closed and fenced off. We tried to go to the playground area inside the Salishan grounds, there was dog poop everywhere and the playground was filthy. We returned a couple weeks later to see if it was a fluke but no, just as gross and our basketball rolled over some dog poop and that was the end of that.
They double charged me rent in March, then put a ‘second “Pay Rent or Quit” notice’ on my door a few days later (never received the first). After much back and forth I received acknowledgment of their wrongdoing. I felt I was pretty cool about them taking $2400 out of my account (rent is $1200/month), but the front office handled this so poorly it was ridiculous. The following month I reconnected with the manager to verify the autopay was setup and good to go, she never got back to me and I just wrote a check and had my wife take it in. The last time I went to the office with a problem she blew up on me. Perhaps I approached her wrong with my pregnant wife had to jump over the balcony to get into the house because the locks on the front door are shotty.
I’ve determined the owner/managements strategy is to market the place to look like a luxury resort, investing in repaving the parking the lot, landscaping, keeping the front pool clean and pretty (back pool area is a different story). Once your locked in, they don’t care about you, which explains the high turnover and moving vans every weekend in the parking lot.
The year living here is an experience that needs to be forgotten. The primary reason we moved here was because they took large dogs, Foxborough apartments down the street has the same dog policies, try that place.
When we moved they reported back to potential landlords that I had bounced checks twice, something that was mentioned in the aforementioned ‘second notice’ after they had charged me twice that month (and autopay had worked fine the previous 6 months).< /Review>

<Review>Very annoying apartment to live in. Not only do the CONSTANTLY do unnecessary upgrades to the apartment complex that come to an inconvenience to many people but when the do those "upgrades", nothing changes. The first month I moved in they tour down alot of wood finishings on the balconies which exposed the wood to the elements (this is when it was raining everyday). Then instead of replacing the now wood rotted support beams, they instead just covered it with painted finishings. They barely matain the second pool which is the only pool that kids rarely go to. Which is totally fine that kids play in the pools but it's frustrating when all the pools are not matienced. On top of everything, which pushed me to write this review. The complex decided that they wanted to do major parking lot construction and instead of giving me a months or weeks notice. I receive a note on my door two days before they place tow zone signs in the area where I have to park. Not only was the asphalt construction not needed, but they didn't suggest or offer alternative parking in a safe area considering I pay for security and gating. Gating which barely ever works in any given week span.

UPDATE:

Woke up to another morning of homeless people sleeping in the children’s park. Any parents moving here, I really hope you aren’t allowing your children to the park unsupervised as this apartment complex has zero concern for their safety. There’s homeless people digging through trash cans, doing drugs in the park, and homeless people riding there bikes through the complex now look in cars. Want to know how this complex addressed the issue. They removed the bushes from the fence. Great Job Salishan! How about cameras, more lights, and better security because all I see is a security guard that sits on his phone in front of the rental office.< /Review>< Response>

DO NOT LIVE HERE.
When I moved into this apartment complex, I was so excited to live here. However, my excitement was brought to an immediate halt when I discovered the lack of concern the management has for it's residents.
In OCTOBER, someone came into my apartment and boarded off my balcony with a huge, hideous piece of wood. But no big deal, I had thought, they will fix whatever was wrong with my balcony. WRONG. It's MAY now and I still have no access to my balcony, but I listen to the construction workers demolishing walls and other stuff outside my apartment all day long. Its obnoxious and every time I call to ask about my balcony I get a lame excuse. They tried to bribe me with River Cat tickets too lol. I don't want stupid baseball tickets I can get for free, I want my balcony.
Besides the fact that I havent had a balcony for about 8 months now (pretty much my whole lease) they REFUSE to give us a discount on rent. The management is greedy and doesnt care about you. My neighbors have MOLD all through their walls and are having their walls removed/replaced. The construction workers are noisy and obnoxious too.
They claim its a "gated community" but the gates barely work half of the time. The dumpster was "expertly" placed outside of my apartment so I hear the trash being taken at 6am in the morning. Someone's car alarm also goes off constantly through the night and no one does anything about it.
And to top it off, they want to raise our rent to over $1500 for a 1 bedroom without a balcony...
Do yourself a favor and find ANY other complex. I'm thankful my lease is ending soon because I couldnt inagine staying in this place any longer.</review>

<review>I had to leave Salishan two years earlier than I wanted because every time my neighbors' tire went down 25 to 30% because she had a slow leak, but not bad enough to go buy a new tire yet, they kept slapping a "tow away sticker on her car". They are real big on that sort of thing. I figured it was just a matter of time till they started that crap on me. It was the same tire each time and the car was otherwise kept very clean. My neighbor had put up with a lot from the other tenants at Salishan and she never complained or did anything to bother anyone. She had neighbors who begged for food and money from her and another neighbor who complained so much about being able to hear her bathroom fan and her doors opening and closing which was not her fault. Salishan should fix these kinds of things not the tenants. After watching what she went through I thought it best to just leave.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

We had just purchased a truck that hadnt been run in a while, and heard some weird clanking sounds, and needed it repaired quickly as we were due to drive 320 miles home the next day. All auto shops were closed as it was a Saturday and holiday weekend. Autozone employee recommended giving Affordable Auto Repair a call, saying sometimes they answer on their days off. So glad we called. We dropped it off, and Tommy was able to point out the source of the noise and fix it all in under 2 hours. Gave us a fair quote and then finished even faster so the price went down. He recommended getting all new tires as well. And checked the date code for us to make sure he was giving us correct information. He said hed love to sell us 4 new tires, but he knew we would be better off getting the warranty down where we live, so he said personally he would drive it home carefully as is. So thankful for his honest opinion. We made it home safely without a hitch. We also got to meet his playful great dane, Zeus. All in all, it was an awesome experience, we will be going back if we ever encounter any car trouble during our monthly trips up to Oakhurst. Thanks Affordable Auto!!! :)<//Review>

<review>What an amazing family. Broke down in Vons parking lot on way back to the Desert. Man approaches me and asked if ok? I explained the problem and He said I'll be right back. He came with a tester and had called his son Tom and he was in the shop...Sunday late afternoon!! (Angel) Tow truck took me up there and Tom and his help busted out all the computer stuff and gauges and between the two of them they sorted out the problem with Mass air flow and fixed it and we were gone in less than 45 minutes. They truly saved our butts as I had an appointment at home. If stuck or just need an honest mechanic. This is the only place to go.<//review>< Pictures>

I would give Affordable Auto Repair a 10/5 if I could. Their customer service is impeccable. My friends and I went to Yosemite for Fire Fall and we had a mishap where our snow chains tore through our brake line. We were driving on the mountains with no brakes! Talk about scary.. Oakhurst borders Yosemite, but no shops were open over the weekend. We were desperate and started calling every shop anyways. When we called Affordable Auto Repair, Tom the owner picked up. He told us he wasn't open, but he's at the shop and feel free to drop by and he can take a look. We got our tow to bring our car to Tom and within 5 minutes of inspecting, he knew what he needed to get and how long it was going to take. He was getting a part from Sacramento and said it should be here on Sunday at 3 pm. We rented a car the next day determined to catch the Fire Fall. Since this event happens during sunset, we couldn't get off the mountain until way past dusk. We warned Tom and Nick (mechanic) about this and Nick graciously gave us his phone number to call before we get back to the shop. We didn't get out of Yosemite until about 8:30 pm due to all of the traffic and when we got to the shop, the car was all ready to go and fixed!

Did I mention they did this all over the weekend when they were closed? I'm not sure how we got so lucky to find this shop, but I sure am glad we did! The cherry on top was that they really live by their name! It was a lot cheaper than we expected. Truly Affordable Auto Repair.<//Text>

My car broke down on the way to Yosemite.  Car had to be towed.  I picked Affordable Auto Repair based on the reviews.  What a great choice.  Tommy took amazing care of my vehicle.   His rates are exceptionally fair.  He is honest and friendly.   He explained clearly the problem which caused the car to overheat and then made all the repairs on his day off, no less.   I can't recommend this shop enough.   If I lived locally,  Tommy would be my mechanic for life.< /review>

On our way into Yosemite on a Saturday we had an electrical issue causing us to go into "Reduced Engine Power". Tommy and Nick were AMAZING and even though they were closed on the weekend, they had us come down to the shop so they could take a quick look. Within 20 minutes they had found the root of the problem and had us back on the road. Cannot thank the guys enough, really friendly and good at what they do!< /Text>

I drove up to Bass Lake from So Cal and my alternator went out. Thank God for Affordable Auto Repair. They found an alternator for an excellent price and had me back on the road, on the day that I had planned to return. BTW this was 2 years ago and this review is long overdue but I still greatly appreciate their honesty and great service. Thank you.< /Text>

HONEST Businessmen ..
GREAT Technicians ..
FAIR Prices ..
ETHICAL Practices ..

"Affordable Auto" has taken care of 2 generations of vehicles in my family .. there's a lot to be said about stability and knowing someone's been in the same location for a long time👍

So because I was in another town 55 miles away from Affordable Auto when a young man at O'Reilly's, suggested I seriously look at having some new parts installed in my car, I drove to the closest reputable Repair Shop, and got an estimate .. excused myself, dial Affordable and told them what the problem was .. and without haggling or double talk, they gave me their Estimate .. turns out the price this other shop quoted me, was more than 4X the amount that Affordable Auto quoted me 👍

Honest diagnostics, ethical pricing and doing the repairs properly👍

HIGHLY RECOMMEND Affordable Auto ..
Top Notch pros .. Tommy & Nick are genuine good guys.<//text>

Great place to shop if you need any Asian grocery food items and a good selection of frozen and fresh seafood items. They also have a pretty good selection of fresh produce and specialty bread. I prefer grocery shopping here over many of the other places in this area.< /Text>

🤮🤮🤮🚩🚩🚩BE Careful when you buy a meat product or sausages!!! I bought package of sausages and it was rotten! THEY re-paste prices with date. Always keep receipt for Return.  I Bought it on 01.21.2021 and it was ROTTEN ALREADY!!! On the label sell by 03.23.2021. Look at Sausages. THEY ARE Green🤢🤢🤮🤮<//Review>

Face masks required. Protective food prep type gloves and hand sanitizer also required but furnished by merchant. Entire store sanitized every Sunday night. The amount and selection of food stuff is incredible. This was my first visit to this market place and I would say it is the size of a Costco but all food stuff. The fish market has just about everything, alive and dead. Although I went there looking for alive lobsters but they were sold out.<//review>

This store has the single most extensive collection of products from around the world and it's all useful, not just the junk food. The veggies are amazing, the dry goods are mind blowing and the meats are very accommodating. I love Asian markets but this is SO much more and as a Chef really helps cover my specialty needs. Worth the drive.< /Review>

Health focused policy is appreciated... But it seems management is asking for some negative attention with inappropriate dealings with customers like making customers wear gloves that do not fit my size or no service to you. Causing stress, and anxiety on customers when we are NOT in height of pandemic is not smart.

I won't be back. Nobody cares about that fact... But many people in line pointed they will not be back either.<//text>< Pictures>

Huge Store with lots of variety of items . They do have halal meat here such as chicken, beef, and lamb. There is sandwhich meat, sausage, and steaks for a great price. For about 24-26 pieces of drumsticks it varies by pound , so I paid about $5 to $6 each pack. It's good quality halal meat and clean. Pricing is good here compared to other smaller businesses halal shops.</review>

These people advertised specials in the meat department and then when you show up they don't have what the ad is advertising and then when you ask for some help they laugh at you and keep talking between themselves. They spend a lot of time blocking the meat aisle with their cards without doing any work. I will never come back to this place. They are rude and insensitive to others around them. Good riddance<//text>

Keeping this virus on lockdown! Seriously though, I do applaud their precautionary measures.
Amazing produce section and wonderful grocery selection.  I want to get lost for hours.
The food court was a disappointment.<//Review>

I was very impressed with the selection of fish and sea food.  At first site I thought it was fairly small but then I discovered the other sections. There are two main sections for the groceries and a third section after the check stands that is a food court. Tucked away next to the check stands is a small room with additional alcohol. Some of the bottle there are super cool shapes.<//Text>< Pictures>

A must go to supermarket that has pretty much everything. I live in the bay area and everytime I go to Sacramento, I would always go to KP. They have people wear gloves and sanitize before going into the store.</Review>

<review>A bit overkill with the covid precautions in my opinion. Of course you have to wear a mask but you also have to put on gloves they supply and sanitize said gloves before going in the store. Anyways the store is usually quite crowded but that's for good reason, this place has all kinds of food you really can't find anywhere else. All the weird Japanese/Korean candy you could dream of, samyang fire noodles in bulk, unique alcohol I've never even heard of, 6 and 12 packs of soju, the biggest seafood selection I've ever seen, and that's just scratching the surface. You could really spend all day looking around this store if you can handle the crowds. Buying unique food and trying it out makes for a fun date too! Check this place out if you haven't already, you won't regret it.< /review><user_id>101479688252447111756< /user_id><username>Danny Loof</username>< GmapID>

<text>Love love the fact they provide gloves sanitized carts and sanitizers before you go in. Lines are as long if you go in morning. Love how they have store inside the store. Love how much food variety they have. Everything is a reasonable price!!</text>< Pics>

<Review>I visited this food store for the first time a week ago, and was very impressed with both the selections of produce, beef and seafood.  Their prices are also very reasonable as are items from abroad.  The quality of the food available for purchase surpassed my expections.<//Review>< pictures>

Worst experience. Going above and beyond COVID restrictions. Better wear a hazmat suit if you want to shop here. All bubble suit people welcome here. Won’t be returning ever again.< /Text>

<Review>This place has a lot to offer. Fresh produce, dairy, canned goods and fresh meats.
There us quite a choosing of products in cookware, eating utensils and other kitchen items.
I love the tea section where you can find strains that most stores don't carry. My favorite ginseng comes in many varieties.
Lots of sweets from all around the world.
Spices, yes they have them.
Also they have a variety of beers from different countries.
Many more items as well as at the checkout there is a bakery with lots of treats. Also in that area is a food court with international meals.
You may need a transaction reader to buy some items as some international items are void of English wording.
One visit and you will be hooked.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIfg82IR220fhs8rTUGdShkIKvoRTxT_fLwnYz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPwj4wJAvcpVViSKjZ8S09rgTUi0f2BOOj7TV-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0VCJV3D3jieN5tM_LjtMf8h7cHRjmlTnhex13=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUIgDO0d56EQX-1hUgwVm_-MLBBuEI151isWg9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSQVD0hjY4Ldvh9w6L5njGat5D7-h253vHEi7q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4eoJYVrhpuXHwMu4xY7mj6MunLKkTBJERi8u2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhfaLlZJ7VSJE73H-KtWQAzQ5RXXd-6paHroDx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaJtHJ6wCCFgbd7LFANn6rBAS1IlxbS9d6oOxO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNq_5O-OcXBPGcEj7KbFUC-qlXM4w3MiZ1VNRFn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPY3QiiFDUBILqvjPo-BXSJ510tcwCyMdPDYCS8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO30rKUp1cdbJ0ib8Lml3reh8oH27xsiZHhbTjn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG5eiV8yGBOqva54mebjt5iipLmElH5Mcd522J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPX-K8yHQ1xxztGgEEW4yJ-_m-eOqHLo3FbXdvf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAea3fUZdwLbAPX45dADvhAABMS6QI19via2kI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM271xyOTcd0a_rF9j3Dizu7jthJ4nLghwBvT0h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4Bw5zEqSem_-nOE5PkmL_U1DmDtX6CTma7un5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3m1fFL2LKFX_8td91Oukl4V3QOvzGJlpmVFlM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x809add6cec217ce7:0xd2c4a926a3f8f3ff<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Cashiers are behaving so rude for the second time just because I did not use plastic bags for each item. Please remember that you are giving too many plastics to environment.<//text>

<review>KP Market is the only place requiring masks gloves and sanitation.  This is amazing! I dont want to shop along side of people who spread germs willingly. Not only are they the only store going above and beyond in sanitation but you can get everything and I do mean everything! Their produce is absolutely unmatched by ANY store! Fish selection is incredible! Prices are cheap! Staff is amazing! Wish I worked there!< /review></record>

Displace has a variety of culture ingredients that you can't find very many places around the Sacramento area. During this covid situation they have handled it extremely well with the highest safety. You're given gloves, hand sanitizer, and wearing face masks. Since I'm from the Bay area the staff in here are much more friendlier.</Review>

<Text>There is a large variety of produce which was the first surprise. I was very impressed with the selection of fish and sea food.  At first site I thought it was fairly small but then I discovered the other sections. There are two main sections for the groceries and a third section after the check stands that is a food court. Tucked away next to the check stands is a small room with additional alcohol. Some of the bottle there are super cool shapes.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZN0TGKjfBuS8Slt12LrjWnT14NecOy4w3hNNE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url':

This is a fun place to shop. You never know what kind of imported and domestic foods you're going to find. They also have an amazing fruit and vegetable selection. I enjoy coming here any chance I get l. I tend to load up on sweets, but its good to look at the meat because the beef that they carry has an amazing marbling to it</Review>

Everything Asian is here. The prices are just right compared to Seafood city is more convenient. And of course American and European foods are also here.</Text>

<text>If you buy the bread from their bakery then
Do not lose your receipt!!
There might be bugs in your bread.

I found bugs in the bread from their bakery. Twice in a row!!!!!
First one was from their soboro bread
And second one was from mommos? Bread.

I know but this is my first fault.
First one was even a live fruit fly. I didn't complain about first one because i was too tired to go back to KP.
But after i found bugs from second one (not even one) i had to.

After that i went to their customer service and customer service lady asked me if i have a receipt. Which i didn't have.
I know it's my fault that i lost the reciept but i don't usually expect bugs from the bread and keep the reciept for that reason.

But if the receipt were really matter, they could've checked their camera. It's everywhere.
Customer service lady said without receipt she won't do anything about my problem. Didn't even check up my bread.
It was really disappointing.
I go to KP at least twice a week. And can't be more disappointed.

I don't need that couple dollars refund. The point is they didn't even check my bread and kept saying we get bread every morning and there's no way there can be bugs in there.

If you want to be working in the customer service you need to listen to customer. It's not just for return. Literally it's damn "Customer Service." Not refund service.

I'll never ever buy their bakery and will report this for other customers.

It's not clear photos but it has legs smh.< /text>< Pictures>

Fun place to shop! Feels more like a field trip than a simple trip to a store. They have their covid act together with social distancing, hand sanitizer and plastic gloves available. The seletion is incredible. If you can't find what you want, it may not exist! The prices are lower than other places so I like to stock up on those items. KP International Market is a great asset to the Sacramento region and I look for excuses to go. The downside is that it's a bit far from my home so not exactly convenient.</review>

KP International Market / Koreana Plaza is adjoining. This place is like an adventure of discovery! Foods from all over the globe essentially.  Prices are comparable, and many specials throughout. The day I visited, the "Pocky" cookie vendor had a booth setup in the store, and if you bought 3 cookie packages you get a free insulated zippered grocery bag.  There is a food court on the Plaza entrance,  and in the grocery entrance there is also a small booth to buy freshly made Korean street food fare. Happy shopping!<//text>

KP is great for just about everything and particularly for hard to asian items. They have my favorite Lao Gan Ma chili sauce, a billion different gochujangs, tons of different ramen, and their produce section is always fresh and stocked with stuff you may not see elsewhere like those long skinny eggplants (the only kind I like). They also have Indian, Mexican, and Eastern European stuff, and a small selection of American groceries. The store is massive and often busy but the staff are super helpful, even when I'm horribly mispronouncing a random item I'm trying to locate amongst the maze of aisles.</Review>

The lavash bread, imported nectar, isles and isles of speciality items at very reasonable prices, all things considered. Well worth a look.</text><UserId.>117005949330696096000<//UserId.>< Gmap_id>

The bakery and boba tea shop were open very clean hand sanitizer stations , they were full. Nobody was serving much stuff because of covid-19.. regulations. Which is understandable. They are very on top of everyone wearing a mask and gloves and hand sanitizer at the front door. And making sure others are 6 ft a part from one another.< /text>

Because of covid-19, there may be a line to enter. I suggest going early when there isn't a line yet. The store does provide gloves for all customers to wear prior to entering.< /review>< Name>

Great selection of asian packaged dessert snacks like Swiss rolls, mochi, buns, pancakes in the refrigerated section. An extensive variety of produce too ! They are being extra cautious w/ covid making you wear gloves, mask and then sanitizing the gloves before entering, which is a big thumbs up on safety 👌🏼< /Text>

<text>Very mindful of the virus, more so than most big name stores, which I like.  Very clean and well stocked on almost everything.  Very impressive especially during a time like this.  Prices are higher than what i'm used to but they do have things that you can't really get anywhere else.  Line to get into the store is surprisingly brief.  This review will mostly only be valid for Corona.  Ive visited when life was normal and i have no complaints other than certain prices being higher which is understandable.<//text>< resp>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>This has been my go to Korean/Asian Market since the beginning of Covid19 and I’m unhappy to have to write to this review but I think people are obligated to know. Workers do not take wearing masks seriously anymore. This is especially concerning with the cashiers who are at the closest proximity to you, who don’t take precaution by simply wearing a mask for the protection of others. Today there were a lot of these workers, last time I did a grocery run it was just a few.

What I was most shocked to see were all the women working at checkout chatting away with their masks completely down, nose and mouth exposed, while handling customers with no consideration. Not sure why this is happening, perhaps an act of rebellion or a statement of some sort. I honestly don’t understand why they’re not taking precautions/customer safety seriously.

I was very disheartened to see they weren’t even phased to put up their masks over their nose and mouth at least with the customers with children and babies at check out. This was very weird, especially considering the spike in cases, but also because other stores, workers are very diligent with taking safety precautions for customers with at least wearing a mask over their mouth and nose.

I started coming here because someone in my family suggested this place since my go to Bay Area Korean/Asian markets were having Covid19 cases with workers, but now, I wouldn’t be surprised if this place has workers with it too.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x809add6cec217ce7:0xd2c4a926a3f8f3ff</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

So many great options at really reasonable prices. Some of my favorite things include the banh mi, fried cuttlefish, and spiral potatoes. They have tons more options though, like hot dogs, tacos, piroshkis, and much more. The bakery in the food court is also full of tasty treats!</review>

<Text>Store smells like fish dept.all the way on other end of building.( This is a HUGE store )Ok with me but was not ready for that in vegetable dept. No frog legs. Bought 60$ of oysters. Luckily I know pre opened oysters are dead. They had 1 bag that half were open & would not close no matter how much I shook them.
They have MANY products that you would never see in an Non K.P. store !!!
I mean this as a positive but honest review . 4 stars 👍.
I will drive from Roseville to Rancho again .  Allegedly There was one ? In Roseville at one time but Yelp or Google maps does not recognize it or can produce an address .< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Do not lose your receipt!!
There might be bugs in your bread.

I found bugs in the bread from their bakery. Twice in a row!!!!!
First one was from their soboro bread
And second one was from mommos? Bread.

I know but this is my first fault.
First one was even a live fruit fly. I didn't complain about first one because i was too tired to go back to KP.
But after i found bugs from second one (not even one) i had to.

After that i went to their customer service and customer service lady asked me if i have a receipt. Which i didn't have.
I know it's my fault that i lost the reciept but i don't usually expect bugs from the bread and keep the reciept for that reason.

But if the receipt were really matter, they could've checked their camera. It's everywhere.
Customer service lady said without receipt she won't do anything about my problem. Didn't even check up my bread.
It was really disappointing.
I go to KP at least twice a week. And can't be more disappointed.

I don't need that couple dollars refund. The point is they didn't even check my bread and kept saying we get bread every morning and there's no way there can be bugs in there.

If you want to be working in the customer service you need to listen to customer. It's not just for return. Literally it's damn "Customer Service." Not refund service.

I'll never ever buy their bakery and will report this for other customers.

It's not clear photos but it has legs smh.</Review>< GmapID>

<Time>1595052798341</Time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>Very mindful of the virus, more so than most big name stores, which I like.  Very clean and well stocked on almost everything.  Very impressive especially during a time like this.  Prices are higher than what i'm used to but they do have things that you can't really get anywhere else.  Line to get into the store is surprisingly brief.  This review will mostly only be valid for Corona.  Ive visited when life was normal and i have no complaints other than certain prices being higher which is understandable.</text>< Pics>

They provide with various sizes of gloves, mask and hand sanitizer for free at the entrance so you can shop safely. They care and other supermarkets should learn from them.  Thank you.<//Review>< Pictures>

But some of the cashiers are horrible, they treated customers like someone who owed them million dollars. Some cashier ladies made me nervous and I had to observe for a while before I pick a line to check out. Personally try avoid shopping here since KP is not the only affordable market in the city.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Great fun to shop at and a huge, wonderful selection of Hispanic, Russian, Korean, Japanese, and many other types of food. The produce selection is diverse and inexpensive. The meat selection is also large and diverse. The entire overall atmosphere of the store is friendly, although good luck if you need to find something specific. The selection is so huge that finding one individual thing cam be a challenge. Even the staff don't always know.< /Review>

This place is pretty big compared to others. It's clean and has a variety of food choices spanning the globe. From Asian foods, Middle Eastern, Russian and places in between. It is clean with friendly staff members that frequently sweep the aisles. The meat and seafood selections are great along with their fruits and vegetables. The grocery sections are well stocked with a plethora of options. Did I mention KP International food court? That's next door but that's for another time. Kimchi anyone?< /text>

Honestly one of the best stores ive been to, it has so many foods that you wouldnt get in America, hence being called an international market. But just there is such a big variety and if you want to make something such as, Lotus Root and Pork Rib soup, it has the ingredients for it there, or if you just wanna try something you havent had before, its a great place to go.</review>

<review>KP Market is flipping amazing. Any type of Asian food you want it's here. Lambs, chickens, live crabs. Stores gigantic. They have an amazing hot food area with at least nine different types of Asian Foods, soups and noodles and chicken.

Wow~! They are providing gloves at the sanitizing station before enter the store. I feel really safe to shop here. You can find everything to make Korean food. I think meat is little expensive than regular supermarket.</review>

Honestly one of the best stores ive been to, it has so many foods that you wouldnt get in America, hence being called an international market. But just there is such a big variety and if you want to make something such as, Lotus Root and Pork Rib soup, it has the ingredients for it there, or if you just wanna try something you havent had before, its a great place to go.</Text>

<Review>Probably the worst grocery store experience in Sacramento. The security is pretty hostile. They don’t allow any bags or bottles. The only good thing is the selection of goods and prices are decent. 99 Ranch is a little more expensive, but at least you don’t have to deal with TSA.< /Review>< pictures>

I've always enjoyed this store because of it's produce, meat, and wide variety of spices and seasoning. Since Covid-19 they have taken great precautions by enforcing safety measures and social distancing. I definitely respect the store and it's management even more.<//review>

The produce is extravagant.  So much selection. Chinese eggplant, Japanese  eggplant,  Italian eggplant,  Indian eggplant,  Thai eggplant,  baby  eggplant...the only one that I didn't see was the "normal" Globe eggplant. Fresh Thai basil, Italian basil,  mint, coriander  and  tons of  other greens  that I only read about in cookbooks.  Only two types of tomatoes Roma and on-the-vine though.  Ok section of fruit lower prices than Raley's however they  varied in size and color, so only got grapes and bananas. The other sections were ok because the products were  in its own  language and I wearied over  picking  them up to read the U.S. labeling.  It's  definitely for people  who already know about the food.  There's one entrance where there's a table for one to put on protective gloves,  then another table to put on the hand sanitizer and a guard  at the entry point  to ensure compliance with mask, gloves and sanitizer.  I stayed  too long  in there looking at  everything because my hands  were  sweaty and my mask was making it hard to  breathe. The  only way out is through check out. Once  through check out, you are in the food  court  area.  Don't  make  a mistake like me and  try to  enter the market from the check out area  because  the guards will stop you  from  going  in. Also, the bathroom is  outside of the market and  you will have to leave your cart inside  the  market,  make sure you let the guard know that you are just  going  to  the bathroom.   They will give you instructions how to use the temporary lockers. There's no  bread or cereal aisle however there's a  bakery in the food court that sells milk toast and buns.<//text>

What an incredible place. As soon as we turned in the parking lot my 6 year old said Gosh Dad I've never seen a bigger store. This is truly an international market. We are in the food court which was better than most asian food restaurants. This place is a store, restaurant, and destination!< /review>

One of my favorite places for a grocery haul, especially for ethnic foods. As a meat and seafood lover, I'd go there to pick up speciality cuts not available at a conventional grocery stores, farmer's markets, butcher's shops, or meat delivery services. Also has a great food court (although I do not usually eat there). Also conveniently located next to the light rail station.</review>

Gloves and hand sanitizer at entrance , customers and employees all wearing masks and trying as best they can to not get up close. Good experience in these times.

One of my favorite places for a grocery haul, especially for ethnic foods. As a meat and seafood lover, I'd go there to pick up speciality cuts not available at a conventional grocery stores, farmer's markets, butcher's shops, or meat delivery services. Also has a great food court (although I do not usually eat there). Also conveniently located next to the light rail station.</Review>

There are various things here like fresh produce to even different kinds of instant noodles. Yes other Asian supermarkets are like that too but the biggest difference is that when you are done shopping, you are now where all the restaurants are. The restaurants have many different kinds of food that are served such as Vietnamese, American, Japanese, Mexican and the original Korean food. They also have a korean BBQ inside, you can buy some boba or tea and there is also a small cosmetic store. Would very highly recommend if you love a good meal after shopping!<//text>< GmapID>

<text>This place is great! My bro and I went in to stock up on rice and found several other tantalizing items at amazing prizes (like ice coffee drinks for a buck each). KP is immense, big enough to house a karaoke spot as well as a food court, both of which I look forward to checking out next time I roll through. In short immense size, superb selection, and good prices to boot.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Hubby and I discovered this place a couple of months ago. We like trying out various grocery stores. (This is our kind of date.😅) KP is so far the best we've tried. We've been getting all our produce here. Aside from being cheaper from other supermarkets, they have a big variety of products to choose from. They also have weekly special discounts like ribeye steak only for $3.29 per lbs. Isn't that a steal?!</review>< pictures>

We arrived about thirty minutes after it opened, grabbed a basket and made our way in and out of every aisle the huge grocery store has (starting in the frozen food/produce working our way to the exit) The selection of lots of different frozen items was great, pricey, but they offer lots of different things. The produce selection seemed to have a huge variety as well and was also pricey. Making our way through the aisles of rice,noodles,asian sweets, teas etc it we definitely felt rushed, it wasn’t very crowded at all, but being in an aisle with 3 people and 3 baskets felt cramped so I can only image what its like when its busy. Checking out all the different drinks and breads towards the exit was great. So many options! The seafood, desserts and sweets all looked delicious, but we would never buy the seafood there everything in that back area looked FILTHY!! This store absolutely needs a deep cleaning. There were lots of rude shoppers and unhappy looking employees during our visit, no hellos, no greetings or smiles. Its not hard to be kind to be people. The only clean areas in the store was right after you checked out in the food court, bakery, lobby area. We wanted to love this place, so it could be our new market to get all of our asian food groceries, sadly this will bot be our place.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

This place is amazing. If you like international cooking, this store has every authentic ingredient you will ever, ever need. It is fun just to wander around the store exploring all the different and interesting foods from around the world. The food court is also really tasty.< /text>

<text>We get the 40 pound box of chicken when they go on sale for 20 bucks... And this week we ate a porterhouse for less than 6 bucks! 😁 Their organic produce is good also and have a"real" fish market, like Seattle's Pike's market.... But they don't yell and throw the fish...lol< /text><Response>None<//Response><pictures>None< /pictures><date>1582414508395<//date>< userid>

This store has something for everyone. Rice, noodles, meats, Couque D'Asse.  What's Couque D'Asse? It's the thing when you get a fingerling cookie and put something inside of it. Usually a cream filling. Sometimes it's sweet, sometimes it's salty. Normally it depends on what the package handler has eaten recently.
Srsly though, this place is great. About half of it is an Asian supermarket that can fly with the best of them. The remaining other half-ish is comprised of worldly foods. The former Soviet Bloc food section and selections  are surprisingly nice.  Not like a surprise Couque D'Asse. One is never prepared for a surprise Couque D'Asse.
7/7, would recommend to anybody!</text>

<review>This place was recommended to me and I found the prices, especially for the meats to be incredible! The food court is a great place to try different International Foods. The market turned out to be much more than I expected. I definitely will say try it and you will like it.< /review>< Pics>

I have a love-hate relationship with this market.  You can't beat the selection and variety of ethnic foods (watch your prices) and the meat and seafood prices are competitive and product great quality...until you have to ask for help at the butcher counter.  :-( The checkout lines are more like a free-for-all with customers pushing in and being rude.  The design I am sure, is to prevent thieves from running out, but it's a bottle neck when they are busy, which seems to be always.<//Text>

<review>I’m writing to put in a complaint about how one of your employees handle your “no outside food or drink rules.” I had a drink in my hand going to the store at the grocery end of the mart as I’m not familiar with the area and this is my first time at the store. One of the security guard, an African American man grabbed me, separated me from my family, and led me back to the entrance. He refused to let me talk to my family who was unaware of what was going on. He pointed to the sign at the lower left corner of the door and accused me saying that I didn’t know how to read. He then refused to let me in so I could get the car key from my family to put my drink back in my car. He basically argued that I need to finish my drink outside before I could go in or leave my drink on the ledge. He then went on a ramble and started to accuse me of not knowing how to read  and that the mart has the right to refuse service, in front of everyone. I’m displeased as to how he handled the situation and basically insulted me with his words and attitude treating me like I’m some thief.  I totally agree and respect the store rules. However, as an educated person, I find that he  has offended me based on his conduct and attitude. I hope that you address this situation so that no other customer would suffer from this insult.</review>< resp>

This is my go to store because they sell international foods and liquor. The staff is helpful if you need tranlation and they have nearly 98% of the foods on earth. Been shopping here for four years and I have never been disappointed.< /text>

Won't let you in without both a mask AND gloves, gloves have been proven to do more bad than good with how people are leaving them on and touching everything or just littering them all over the ground. Company isn't actually worried about their employees, just following stupid guidelines made by stupid people. Won't be returning during or after the quarantine<//Review>

So this place has everything...  random spice from India... sure, Canned goods from  Poland..yes indeed, Russian candy, meats and string cheese .. yep! Belgian chocolate or Fruits I have only seen on TV ... they have that too. The grains from any Asian region... just ask! A frozen foods section that is bigger than average grocery store,  a seafood counter with more sea products than anywhere in the area.... So many Knickknacks I am afraid to ask the purpose of...   fresh produce that is really good and cheaper than anywhere else...  Oh and booze!!!! ... So much booze from around the world!</review>

BEWARE before you go to this store. They are requiring customers to wear gloves, which is Not required the the Sacramento County Health Department Nor The CDC...Gloves if not used properly is actually Re-contamination of everything you touch !!! Do Your Research People !!</text>

Horrible place.  There was a door Nazi who yelled at me and my kids for exiting through the wrong door.  Apparently it was just an entrance, not an exit.  The exit was far away from where I parked, and my child was in crutches, but did that matter?  Nope!  He just kept yelling.  What customer service!  The place was crowded, noisy, and most of the produce was rotten.  I wouldn’t go here again.  I don’t even think this place deserves a star.<//Text>

This place truly does care about the Covid-19 situation.this is the only place that I have been to that has many layers of protection for their customers.

Yes, it is kind of a pain in the butt trying to enter the store but it is for everyone's protection.</text>

<review>I love KP International Market! This is your one stop grocery store if you need ethnic ingredients to make ethnic foods at a reasonably low price!

< review>
just went there today as of May 22 around 5pm
.
there was a line to get in but it was quick, like no wait. as your in line, you have to put on disposable gloves which is provided and a mask is required which u need to have on and mask is not supplied. after gloves are on they provide hand sanitzer which needs to be used with gloves on.
.
as your inside the place recommend you to social distance and don't get to close to customers or workers.
.
overall experience I feel safe to go inside and shop. and the food court is still opened but oy togo only.< /review>

A little pricey with shelf items, but their meats are very affordable. You can get a T-bone steak for as little as $4. Very clean store and a lot to choose from. The 4 stars is mostly for the butcher department.</review>

The best store in the world there are snacks and ingredients from every country. You can literally find everything from fresh produce to Japanese soda to food court pastries.oh yeah and there's a good court. They also have cooking utensils and containers and skin care and toiletries from many countries so there is anything you want</Review>

Market was pretty busy but we really appreciated how it was required that EVERYONE wear gloves and masks. Even a glove and sanitatizing stand were provided before entering.

Great grocery and food selection. Love the euro snacks and groceries. Food court food was to go only, and the Korean fast food is super good, especially the Yukaejang. But the Bibim Naengmyun is not great, just meh.</Text>

<Review>This market has the widest selection of international goods I've ever seen. Easily the size of two groceries, and half of that is entirely Korean and Japanese goods. The other side of the store has a vast selection of fresh meats, fish, and cheeses, as well as other import goods from other countries. They also have an international food court with tons of different things to choose from!</Review>< Pictures>

Extraordinary unique business in Rancho Cordova. KP International has foods from around the world with a delicious food court. Not only do they have a food court but they also have a Karaoke spot that you can order drinks and food at and Billards as well. Definitely a unique place and a wonderful addition to Rancho.< /review>

This market has the widest selection of international goods I've ever seen. Easily the size of two groceries, and half of that is entirely Korean and Japanese goods. The other side of the store has a vast selection of fresh meats, fish, and cheeses, as well as other import goods from other countries. They also have an international food court with tons of different things to choose from!<//text>

<user>108079596923584677083< /user><Review>My family and I shop here every one and awhile since KP is roughly about a 40 minutes drive for us. Of all the times that we’ve been here we usually have a pleasant experience. (The cashiers and workers don’t greet or anything though which is fine.) Never question their meat department until a couple weeks ago when a LIVE crawfish fell on the ground - on the customer’s end - and we inform the meat workers and he just causally picks it up and threw it over back in the pile. And mind you, they were cleaning and mopping that day too. Not sure how the meat process works if it comes prepackage or if it’s butchered there but I question my meat purchases now.

Other than that I do enjoy their bakery selection and the variety’s of culture food they offer.</Review><date>1572771149471<//date>< Rating>

Great place to shop for specialty foods/ingredients. Very wide range of international foods. Great place to find any hard to find spice or ingredient that you cant find in your local grocery store. Also huge selection of produce. They also make thier own fresh tortillas/chips daily. I go for a great selection of honey.</text>

<text>The store is requiring everyone to wear masks and gloves to enter the store. They have employees at a sanitizing station outside the entrance. The employees have no clue that they are spreading germs, bacteria, and viruses with their handling of sanitized materials. Saw the sanitizer employee, touch the uncovered table 8 times, his pants twice, the sanitizer solution bottle 4 times, his mask twice, then without switching gloves or anything else reach in and touch all the different sized gloves,  and then the masks. Again, without ever changing his own ppe after exposing them to the stuff they are trying to prevent. Wouldn't let me in the store, when I asked him to change his own ppe, before touching the ones he wanted me to wear.< /text>< pics>

<review>Great place to score deals and harder to find international items. Know your prices though, some things aren't competitively priced. Also definitely be picky and plan on using it quickly when buying their produce. It is always such a good price for a reason. It never lasts long.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Great place to find fresh produce at a fair price. They also carry a huge variety fruits and fresh herbs. They also have a fish market. I call this place a one stop and shop. You will find new things here every time you come. This place has variety everything from Asian to Italian. I shop here weekly.<//Text>

They have everything! Careful with meat purchases. Specifically beef. In order to keep their costs down they buy a cheaper cut of beef than most grocery stores.  Instead of prime you get "choice". Therefore you really have to ensure enough marbling is in meat or slow cook in a liquid base. I HAVE been able to get good cuts but ya have to really look or go somewhere else.</text>

Love this place. The baklava is affordable, authentic and delicious, and if you need damn near ANYTHING, they have it. Russian, Polish, Ukrainian Spanish, German, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, if grandma had a receipe, or if you had one before moving to the states, this store has it. Fresh baked breads, pitas, etc. Even good affordable kitchenware. Go here, it's worth the drive. Happy cooking everyone!</Text>

First time inside this store. Drove an hour to get here.  Complete chaos. I was unable to find what i came here for.  Staff unfamiliar with product locations. After one employee was semi kind enough to walk me over to what he said was the correct isle, another customer called me a foreigner, laughed and walk way.  FOREIGNER!! I was the one born here.  To be called a foreigner on AMERICAN SOIL, so rude and disrespectful.  Will not shop here again.< /text>

Large, with good selection. The produce isn't very fresh, but it's very cheap. It's perfect if you plan on cooking them within a day or two. Also, there's about 30 aisles of packaged foods and condiments, so if you need anything Asian, you'll most likely find it. Also, it's grouped by country, which makes shopping for a specific recipe much easier than some other places that just group like with like.</Text>

The staff leave much to be desired in the way of common courtesy and equality. I've come here frequently, as much of my cooking requires what are considered hard to find ingredients in Sacramento. One thing I noticed is that there seems to be a subtle undercurrent of racism amongst certain employees. My best guess is that the gap is due to a difference in linguistic familiarity....if you speak the same dialect, you'll probably get a friendly reception aiming to build rapport. On the other hand, failure to do so seems to elicit coldness and a dismissive attitude. I love the multicultural groceries they offer, but this feeling I get is really awkward. It's like I'm an unwanted pet or guest. I consider myself a gentleman, and always do my best to conduct my behavior as such, but these trivialities don't have any bearing on how I'm treated. Additionally, the food court has markedly declined. One of their best restraunts closed, and the other 3 don't offer anything worth what they charge. For these reasons, and much mote, 2 stars is being generous.< /review>

I want to preface my review by saying that I love the actual grocery store/market. However, the KP International food court is a joke. The food is all bland and tastes like they reheat it all in the back.

The MOST AGGRIVATING ASPECT of the food court is the HORRIBLE costumer service. I mean I've eaten here less then 5 times and have heard agruments with the costumers with the staff half the time. I never believed it would happen to me until today where the Korean place gave us the wrong order but absolutely would not take it back to give us what we actually ordered because we had already taken it from the counter. We literally didn't touch the food  and took it back 30 seconds after we got it from the counter! I wouldn't really care about this because mistakes happen but the way the cashier rudely talked down to me as if I did something wrong is absolutely not the way to treat a costumer.

If you're hungry and considering the KP International food court, do yourself a favor and go to any of the better restaurants down the street. The food will taste way more and flavorful and authentic. The price will  be similar but other restaurants will have wayyy better costumer service.<//review>

I love this place. It has everything to Korean food to different cuts of meat for Korean Barbecue. The building looks small from the outside but once you go inside, its big. I've been buying meats and ingredients for Korean Barbecue. Also, bread as well. I bought Gold N Fresh for the past year or so and I tried a new bakery bread. Called Pampangas Bakery. Their bread is way better than Gold N Fresh and other filipino bakery that is in Sacramento.</Review>

This supermarket is by far the best in the Sacramento area to find Asian ingredients. On top of that, they have other select stuff from all over the world. I spend hours in this place every time I visit. After you're done shopping, there are some restaurants inside that serve a variety of foods. It's really an experience outside of regular supermarket shopping.</Text>

Crazy amazing selection in foreign foods. From Asian, Middle Eastern, European, Hispanic and more. Fruit and veg section is awesome in selection. Regular good deals on meat prices and you can ask the butchers for specific cuts at times (had them cut me 2+ in. Porterhouses on more than one occasion). Fish section again has large variety of both filleted and live stock tanked fish. Deli has numerous exotic fares. Drink section is extensive. Also has a bakery, food court, liquor section and Korean BBQ. Great place, but expect to spend waaaay more than intended due to splurging. You've been warned lol.</text>

I truly appreciate this place! “The place” to get all your seafood needs and more! They carry all kinds of things from different Asian culture, their noodle selection is unbelievable! I also love how fresh their sea foods and meat are. Great place to eat and relax, it’s all in one location. Also staff are friendly. Definitely my favorite market ❤️</Text>

<review>Best place for international foods and goods. The store itself has tripled in size from the first time I came for Asian food, looks really nice and has some nice additions from back then. Wish they still played Korean pop in the store, also it was nice having Korean dramas being played in the dinning area. The video section in the front was also welcoming which all of the above is missing now, maybe it can be brought back? ( ;D wink wink) besides those things that are missing from before, this is a really nice place to find some good stuff, and the dinning area also has a variety of choices depending on what your hungry for. They are still expanding to make the store even better, I can’t wait to see what is next!< /review>< rate>

There were so many things that I was  there for a couple of hours and still had only seen portions of the store. I will definitely be returning there and with a shopping list this time.

<text>WOW...,talk about variety! Visited the attached huge international market and was pretty impressed. This place will take you on a world FOOD tour at reasonable prices. After shopping the market, you have to visit the FOOD court. FOOD was tasty, but the best part was watching the international prank show while enjoying an inexpensive quick bite.< /text>< GmapID>

Its becoming its own little center with a mulitcultural food market, karaoke bar, Asian restaurant, Nature Republic (skincare store),  food court, and coming soon a spa treatment center.

Also I'm excited about the seafood and butcher selections... Bought two nice big halibut steaks for only $20 last week which would normally be closer to 50 and it was absolutely amazing... highly recommend

July 2018 update.... the seafood several times since my last review however I have to disclose that the last two times I had halibut in the salmon it had numerous worms in it... The hell of it had red worms the same and has white worms it really freaked me out... The last time I saw worms in Market Fish was about 12 years ago when I had red snapper to Safeway... I realize bottom feeders will tend to have worms but I believe that a proper fishmonger or store will do candling and remove most of the worms when possible these worms are on the surface and obviously had not been candled or physically checked.... I took out the worms as best I could from the halibut and cooked it extra long two temperature that would kill them however I only ate a little bit and me and my son both had stomach aches later although I never told him about the worms my stomach hasn't seemed right for about a week after eating it so I don't think I'll eat the fish there again... I did call them and brought it to their attention in the fish department said they had never seen worms ever ever on their fish which to me sounds not accurate cuz we all know fish has worms in it from time to time I left a message for the manager to call me back and he never called me back... I contacted health department and they indicated that worms will have fish on them and it's not a health violation but rather a customer service issue... I found that strange as I saw many news articles about Costco fish having worms in the health department shutting them down so not really clear about this but I'm not comfortable buying Seafood there any longer... Although I did read you can soak it in cold water and when I did that with the salmon the worms did come out but again I think I prefer to buy wild-caught frozen fish from now on so I don't have to deal with worms.... if anyone has any other feedback I love to hear it because I was so excited about the great tasting seafood at great prices< /Text>< Pictures>

I absolutely love kp!!! I'm a big Asian enthusiast and I drool every time I'm here lol. Everything from unique chopsticks to every kind of ramen imaginable can be found here. The food court is always amazing and the ladies of the makeup salon are extremely kind and helpful. Definitely check this place out and be prepared to get lost in its assortment of international goodness.<//Text>

<review>I frequently do my grocery shopping here since I'm Asian, and the food court is an absolute delight. I've tried food from all the stores here, and they're pretty good.

I do have some concerns about the Blue Corner (they make drinks) though, the taste is inconsistent, sometimes it's good sometimes it isn't. I thought they'd have the proportions down by now.</review><Name>Francis Bello< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<text>I went to the store 5 min before closed and just had to get one item. When I arrived the security was at the door and did not want to let me in I showed him the time  And told him I just needed to get one item. he closed the door on my face extremely rude and didn’t say anything. I won’t ever be going to this place again! I was also a regular shopper ! Fire that security guard horrible lazy customer service I also drove almost 45 min to go to the store for them to just close the door on my face is so not right especially if it wasn’t even 10!!!< /text>< gmapID>

This supermarket is great I like it a lot but it has a very big flaw 1 of the employees that work outside the shopping mall go several times that we have seen it myself and my family that is in a gray car having sex with another guy, the bad Apart from the fact that it is a very bad image for the supermarket, he realizes that people pass by and do nothing about it. It is a thick brown gentleman with a mustache. Thank you, I hope you change it or at least it catches your attention.< /Review>

Great place to shop for imported food.  Mostly Oriental, but a good assortment of eastern Euopean as well.  The produce isle includes locally grown yet unusual fruits and vegetables.

The food court has two food bars.  One with sushi & Korean selections and the other has "Americanized" oriental & Mexican.  Plus a Korean restaurant.

Other related shopping includes oriental kitchen pots & gadgets.< /review>

<Text>Really big, huge fresh produce section, good prices. The most ethnic diverse food store I ever saw. I even saw Romanian beer. The food court was a bad experience (twice in a row), but I can't blame the owner but the chef.</Text>< date>

<review>Too large to cover in short time.  Need to go back few more times to get familiar with the store. The Cara-cara orange molded after two days, the rest tasted like they been in a rotten storage (over ripe and in box too long). Some vegetables were ok,.  Went to get Korean hot pepper powder, have not use that yet.  Overall a good market.<//review>< Pictures>

The produce selection is enormous. And the prices are moderate. Lots of exotic (to most Americans) fruits and vegetables. The first visit is likely to be overwhelming. Once you get familiar with the store, it's fun to shop there. I recommend that you wear comfortable shoes because you will be walking a lot.<//Text>

It's fine. They have all of the stuff that my girlfriend loves from Korea so that keeps me happy. According to her the prices are very high. But oh well, it's the USA.. not Korea! The restaurants are not very good inside.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Honestly the best international store around for many miles. They have some of the best prices for fruits and veggies. Not always quality but when your cooking with it, it doesn't need to look perfect.

The clearance bin is a hit or miss depending on day but always interesting to look through. They have a pretty good selection of products for a wide variety of nations. Japanese, Korean, Indian, philipino, Russian, European etc....

They have a rewards system that you can sign up for. A dollar earns you a point that is worth about a penny towards their food court.

Speaking of which, they also have a nice variety when it comes to their food court. Burgers, hotdogs, Vietnamese pho and Bahn mi, Mexican food, Japanese sushi and bentos, Korean dishes, etc..... There are lots of tables to eat as well as a large screen with a projector that plays some funny prank show.

During the holiday season they have free picture taking with an Easter Bunny or santa. Not sure about other holidays.  Very well done for a free photo. Lastly the staff is always friendly and tries to be helpful. I say try because they don't always communicate well. Overall, one of my favorite places to shop.</text>< pictures>

<text>Fun store. Like a visit to a foreign country. Lots of interesting food. There's a fish monger with lots of choices and good prices. I like looking at the teas, candies, cheezes. For meat eaters there are lots of sausages to choose from. Good selection of produce with good prices.</text></record></dataset><record>

This store is interesting and their prices for produce are fabulous  however,  their produce is never fresh and is of the lowest quality.  It's unfortunate because it's such a unique place to shop.<//Text>

Sunday's are not the day to go to KPs lounge.
They'll shut off the music you paid for and call last call at 11pm.
Save your money and go elsewhere</review>

<rate>4</rate><Review>This food court does have an international selection of meals.
We always opt for the seafood and veggie ones as we do not eat meat.
The food is always hot and well seasoned. We go to the Korean section. There is something for everyone's palate and judging from the international customers that always eat here, they must be doing something right.
Whether you eat here before or after doing your groceries or just come to eat like we do sometimes, you will always leave with a satisfied craving.<//Review><Time>1503124340786</Time><GmapID>0x809add6cec217ce7:0xd2c4a926a3f8f3ff</GmapID><resp>None<//resp><user_name>Cristina Olano<//user_name><userid>105624707432226059431<//userid></record></dataset><record>

<text>I wish I live closer to KP plaza.  The food court is amazing with great variety of selections.  I love getting my bento box with grilled salmon and the seafood noodle bowl.

Hope that there would be more organic options are available.
Pros:  it is pretty clean and no fishy odor.

<review>Great place to get your meats, very fresh very cheap. From chicken/steak to live fish/crab. Other things that I call your every day items like milk, toilet paper, cooking oil. Is really expensive, but you cannot beat the price on the meats! Plus it's an international market so it will probably have that hard to find item you need as well.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

There is the most comprehensive selection for any home cook to be found. My only reason for four out of five stars is price. Across the board there are few areas they are competitive in pricing. Retail costs similar to Raley's and sometimes as high as Whole Foods. Produce and fish quality are well worth that price however packaged goods with high preservatives levels and long shelf life are priced much higher than market. However the selection all Under One Roof does mollify the most visceral argument for the high cost.</Review>

This is a super funky place that any food you should check out. Some of the food in there is what you could find in any grocery store, however there's a ton of stuff from International purveyors that hasn't even changed the labeling, so much so that in some cases you can't even tell what it is. But that's the fun of it. They also have a pretty good-sized food court, yes it feels grimy and depressing, but the Price Is Right In Like I said it's a funky joint. They even have an old school Lounge alla 1970s in there. Karaoke and cheesy pick up lines anyone?</text>

There is a tremendous diversity of food from different continents and different countries, but primarily from Asia. Fruits and vegetables are cheaper than at Walmart, but some are worse by the quality. They suggest Reward Points Card for free to accrue points. You can redeem them at their Food Court.<//review>

There is a tremendous diversity of food from different continents and different countries, but primarily from Asia. Fruits and vegetables are cheaper than at Walmart, but some are worse by the quality. They suggest Reward Points Card for free to accrue points. You can redeem them at their Food Court.<//Text>

<resp>None< /resp><review>I really like this place, huge selection of veggies and Asian goods, fish can be questionable at times but overall is decent! Just make sure you check the gills and the eyes for freshness. We go twice a month to replenish our fridge.

HOWEVER, The food court is absolute garbage, it is difficult to understand how a human being can create such a tasteless pile of food, worst Chinese food in Sacramento, the Korean seafood bowl had nothing to do with the picture and for your safety I would not recommend to eat.

One more thing, do not buy fish with the sale label. Guaranteed food poisoning.

Go tell your moms.</review><user>104859255669389282738< /user></record></dataset><record>

Good deals on meat and produce (although some produce should be used quickly) . . . Lots of international brands.  I shop there myself because it is less expensive than shopping at the big brand supermarkets :)< /Text>

Place is heavily patrol by security guard. Food selection is ok. Seating is abundant but tight. Utinsil are readily available for grab. Self serve, prices are too high especially for this type of atmosphere.. lines are all over the place, don't know who's in line or not. Only recommend is if you're really hungry or just need to grab something to eat then this will suffice.<//Review>

Love the atmosphere and the food at  BBQ place has a variety of yummy dishes. However, I don't recommend La Fonda or Delicatessen! The food is old & bland not freshly made. I didn't even eat what I bought I was very disappointed.< /text>

When you are at the checkout make sure they don’t scan an item two times . It happened to us 3 times already and I have the feeling that they are doing it on purpose!!! They always scan the expensive item one time extra.<//review>

Overall, I love this place. Excellent produce selection as well as a wide variety of ethnic products that aren't commonly stocked at other stores. Can't beat the price on the produce and many of the everyday items are reasonably priced as well. Meat and deli department also have a terrific selection and extremely competitive pricing. The only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is because some of their items are horribly overpriced. Items like salad dressing, detergent, etc. are almost twice what you would pay in other stores. However, they are also very conveniently located next to Target, Walmart, and many other stores so it's easy to pop into another place for the items that are overpriced at KP.<//review>

<rate>2<//rate><review>The market gets 5 stars, the hot food section gets -3...

The market has an incredible selection of foods you would have difficulties find anywhere else. Their selection of slavic foods is good. Their mainland asian and pacific island selection even better. The produce is mostly fresh and prices are reasonable. Their frozen choices are great.

The hot food section has interesting choices, most of which are priced a little too high. Not much, just enough to be annoying. Here is where the service is lacking. You cannot simply get a small cup of water to go with your meal. When I asked, I was directed to a vending machine to buy a bottle of water.

What the...

The price wasn't bad, but the bottle was room temperature. Look, a family who has small children doesn't necessarily want to buy soda for them. The cost of the food should cover a small cup of water.

Not having water is not good customer service.

I am going to use the market. I'll be dammed if I ever use the food court again...< /review><userid>114331626537444941470</userid><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

I made a purchase on New Year's Eve-day and left my ATM card on accident - I didn't even realize I had left it and deactivated my card on 1/2/19 @ about Noon. I called them on 1/2/19 at 6 PM to make an inquiry and they confirmed that they had it.
My card nor money were used or abused 😃.
Thanks KP.</Text>

Love the atmosphere and the food at  BBQ place has a variety of yummy dishes. However, I don't recommend La Fonda or Delicatessen! The food is old & bland not freshly made. I didn't even eat what I bought I was very disappointed.<//Review>

I'm from Hawaii and this place reminded me of home. They had thing from Hawaii that I couldn't find anywhere in California and the price was reasonable. From fresh fish to freash vegetable this store has everything and more. The best part about it all is after you are done shopping the food court has a wide selection of food. There's some Korean, Chinese, Japanese Vietnamese, Thai and American food every one can get what they want.<//review>

Best place to buy affordable Asian noodles! I love the spicy noodles and this is the only place that sells it at an affordable price! I also love the dumplings they sell which are so cheap and don’t get me started on the seaweed lavers! There’s no place like KP Market!< /review>

Best place to get oriental goods, european deli,Hispanic goodies, seafoods-live fish and crabs. Personally i like the Wide variety of fruits and vegetables. I always check their mushroom section, they got different kinds. They got frozen good from different countries.
They also have a bakery and several restaurants inside the building. If you are into karaoke stop by during their happy hours.< /Review>

If you are looking for a little bit of everything... This market is the place. When they say international, they mean it. I have never seen so much cultural diversity in a market. From Russian food to any and all Asian foods, along with a tortillaria. Fresh fish market. They have food court style restaurants as well as a quiet and cozy sit down restaurant.</text>

Always have enjoyed shopping here. KP market carries a very wide of choices -- Japanese and Korean noodles, spices and sauces. All sorts of Frozen and fresh sea food.

The bakery section has regular bread, Mexican tortia, middle eastern pita bread and everything conceivable.

The spices section same, spices from around the world.

Our favorite, beet juice from Georgia and Slavania, pickled and fermented foods from all over Europe.

The produce section has vegetables for Asian -- Chinese brocallie, Okinawan potatoes,... Korean reddish,... Including all regular items such as tomato, bell peppers, lemon,..

Just a delight to see wonderful selection from all over the world.<//text>

I went for my first time today because of the ad... NY steaks for $3.99 per lb. I needed 12, they only had four and were too busy to cut? I ended up with tri-tips, they look fabulous. The veggies were plentiful, but wasn't impressed with the quality. I had a list of things, but only got three there. It took me 30 minutes to get there, 30 to get back. I'm sad😢< /review>

<text>Kp is a great store for finding all those weird ingredients you need. It has pretty much everything! I have been shopping here for a long time and have never had any issues, except for today, and I won't be shopping here any longer.

I bought a boba smoothie from the food court and then proceeded to the other side of the store to get a cart and do my shopping. When I went outside to get a cart I was told I cannot bring food in the store.

The sign on the door says no OUTSIDE food or drink, and I had bought the smoothie literally a couple minutes prior inside the store. I pointed this out to the security guy and he said "too bad, it doesn't matter." I pointed out to him again that the sign says outside food and drink and he again said too bad and pointed to the sign that says "we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone"

Honestly it wouldn't have even bothered me that much if he had cared to be even somewhat polite. I asked a cashier inside if I could speak to a manager and she acted like I had just asked the hardest thing in the world. I told her what I wanted to talk to the manager about and she told me to go talk to security.

Thanks a lot lol. This store has never had good customer service and it has never bothered me, but these two employees are the reason I won't be returning.

If you don't mind being treated badly, it's a great store.< /text>< Response>

<review>I always love coming here! I like to explore new foods and cultures and what other great way to do it, other than diving in and doing it yourself? (There is always the options of having a guide, but I don't have one.)

It doesn't mattering you're just looking for the broth your mother used to use or if you are trying new flavors, KP has you covered. Not all the prices are competitive, so if you know where to get your deals, do so. Seeing as how I've not fou mbv d a more comprehensive, multicultural grocery store, I don't mind getting everything from here.

Weather it's a random adventure, or you are a regular, come in and look around. Try to find something you've never th tried before.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

This is one of my favorite grocers for the variety of food, both Asian and American, and for their amazing food court, bakery, and other restaurant/eatery option. Their meat department is also very diversive, ranging from chicken thighs to cow tongues, to fresh fish/crab that were just swimming in their tanks.<//review>

They have an array of groceries from different ethnicities. They're more korean oriented but still have what we might be looking for. Lines are long but they have a lot of registers. They also have a food court and a bakery.</Review>

The food court only has 3 shops and a drink shop and a proper dit down Korean restaurants. The 3 shops have a mixture of Mexican, Korean, Chinese, Japanese food. The big Asian supermarket is good.<//Review>

Asking for help didn't work since the few gentlemen I asked didn't know what I was asking for.  They tried though, and I found what I was looking for!  The food court items looked delicious so we'll be back again.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The beef bibimbop, japchae and tteokbokki  is delicious, but low key people are asleep on their Mexican food offerings. The pork in green chili sauce ( puerco en salsa verde) is delicious! If you shop in the grocery department, you can earn points too towards the food court purchases.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

This place carries just about every variety of ethnic foods there is with an emphasis on Asian cuisine. It's like a large Safeway for exotic foods.<//review>

Not a fan. These places freak me out as they literally smell inside I think from old rotting meat. I want to buy my meat from a place that is cleaner and does not stink.  Overall if you look closely the entire store is filthy</text>

<Date>1523482118251< /Date><Rate>3</Rate><review>Pro:  Clean and well stocked.  Has a food court and adjoining Korean restaurant.

Con:  hard to find things.  Not organized well and isle signs don't help much.  Entrance is on only one side of building and exit on the opposite end. (Pretty big building too).  Best to park near the exit and not the entrance.  Most staff are in-personal and seem irritated, especially if you ask any questions.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

My potato ring was so salty I couldn't even eat it. The girls just took it back and didn't say a word. Not I'm sorry or did not offer a refund. Would not go back there again.</review>

<review>Rudeness from the security at the door. Don't bring a drink in the store unless you want to treated like a criminal. Was told by a very rude security guard to either put drink in car or take it to the  security desk. They take this drink thing seriously. I opted to take it to the security desk. (Curiosity and it was hot outside) those security people were very nice. So I checked my drink in. Lol. This experience was not very good this time. Been coming here for years and today was a bit much< /review>< Pictures>

I love the prices here I do have to travel 30 miles to get to the place I've been shopping here for over five years now my only problem is is they just can't stand Americans mainly white Americans it's very hard to get any kind of help here but the prices on meat are amazing</Review>

< review>
I really like KP but can only give 3 stars for the lack of customer service skills and mediocre produce. Customer service means a lot to me. I really like KP for the wide variety they maintain and shop there occasionally  to stock up as needed. Usually I know what I'm looking for. However today I wanted to try a recipe with special ingredients I went to KP for. Couldn't find what I needed and didn't get help despite the seriously confused look on my face and asking for help that directed me to an isle #. I came in grabbing a cart but promised myself if I couldn't find what I mainly needed, I'd by nothing and try somewhere else. I left with nothing.
Maybe employees should be trained to not only be ready to assist customers but also look out for those looking confused. It goes a long way to help someone unexpectedly and actually take them to their area of need - especially when the customer's native tongue is English and the items available are mostly in different languages.<//review>

The Korean stall at the KP international food court is a very good place have tasty food. I had beef bone cabbage soup and it was very delicious. Probably it was much better than Yukkaejang. They provide only 2 banchans, but it's fine as I'm more interested in the main dish. BTW, this review is not for the Red Alcove restaurant that's just next to it.</text>

The food is not really authentic korean food but okay overall. The customer service suck. Online food court is supposed to open at 1030am but the lady opened it at 11. Then when i went to ask what i want, she say for the jajamyeon it wont be available until 1130am like brooo we waited since 1030 and you guys ate not even all ready yet???</text>

A Korean international grocery store, with a food court inside as well.  In house meats and fishes.  Asian products line the aisles.  It has a good produce section.  And they also stock typical American items throughout the store.</Text>

<Text>Has almost all of the Asian stuff that you would ever need, even had a ktv and food court attached.

Would not recommend their "fresh seafood" over ice, they're never really fresh, the live ones on the tank are okay.</Text>< name>

I loved to eat there but last half a year their food started getting worse and worse. Maybe they changed  there chef because I can't recognize my favorite meals anymore. They used to be so much better. But Texan burger is really good as my husband says.< /text>

Love the place!
It's so much fun to just be in the store. There are so many things you can get from this store. The main products you can get are, of course Korean foods. We always get a big bin of Kimchee. Their price for Kimchee cannot be beat.
We also get prepared Korean foods like seaweed salad, radish Kimchee, etc.
They have Japanese foods as well. We get Japanese seasonings such as Dashi (Bonito soup base, ) hot pot soup base, and hurikake (rice seasoning flakes.)
They have sample stations and their sample foods are always so delicious that it is guaranteed to make me want to purchase the foods. The sample ladies are always nice and friendly.
I wish this place was closer to where I live.< /review>

I wish I can give them negative 5 stars. These guys are not honest and they just scan your most expensive items TWICE!

That's correct, they did this many times, a lot of my friends and neighbors got this. Some of them found out immediately and most of them noticed after they got home. They did this systematically! About 2 weeks ago, my friend went to this market to buy a few times less than $10, they still add an non-existing time to mark up by $2.

Avoid these guys!</Text>

Come here all the time, they have pretty good prices on food. Food court is kinda sketchy  though. I'd stick to their groceries, their kimba is pretty good. Slightly over priced groceries but the venue and less ghetto location then alternatives like 99 ranch and other asian stores. Edit: paid 8 dollars for stale rich and over sauced meat, waited longer because we ate here instead of to go. If you want your food at any reasonable time say your not eating there.< /review>

Decently priced items for foreign food. Domestic or American foods are a little higher then your regular stores. Nevertheless they have everything you would need.</Review>

Great Korean food supplies, looking for Asian food items, Russian food, Ukrainian food, plus fresh tortillas in the Hispanic section. This is an international food store, it's HUGE!!!! This is not a quick visit place , way way too much to see!!! Seafood is fresh and still alive. Food courts are delish, Korean food court is authentic! Bakery is crazy full of goodies, along with giant fresh pretzels, and all kinds of piroshki's European breads, cookies. Boboa drink bar, giant snowcones! Korean cosmetic store and Korean sit down restraunt.< /Review>

<Review>Last week I went with my entire family to shop at this place. I was setting in the   Accessible car . My husband told me to hold the kid let me go get milk. I was waiting for my husband to come.  Security guard came and told me to move out of the car and move your kid.  I apologize him I said I waiting for my husband so he could take the kid then I will go and check out.  Meanly came to my face and told me Look man you need to move out of the car.  I said my back is hurting I have to sit in this car.  While he was so rude to me my son was crying so much so I gave my son to hold on to the candy bar,  while waiting for my husband.  Security guard came again close to my face said do not open the candy.  And I said sir what’s your problem why you been so route we are customer you shouldn’t treat us like garbage.  He came to and jump to my face, then I start crying front of everyone I feel embarrassed.  We called the manager He didn’t even apologize just keep quiet and shake his head.  I know this place has everything you need fresh produce  fresh food but the management and the people that work there it’s horrible and have no personality specially the security guard.  I would never go to this place again in my life.  And I would never recommend this place to anyone and I will stop my entire family to go there too.<//Review>< pictures>

So much crazy stuff, got all the stuff for hubby to make Korean fried chicken...which was amazeballs...I ate 4 pieces...I want to eat all the chicken skin. Sweet rice flour, potatoes starch, and baking soda make the best crispy chicken skin.< /Review>

They have a covered lady at the cashier by the name of Maryum. She was an unfriendly from the minute we saw her. Seems this nut job could not smile. Absolute moron who even mumbled something to me which I asked her what she said her reply was "Nothing" when I asked her what she mumbled. We usually shop at this location but will never shop again. The Asian cashiers at this store are much friendlier.

Also the meat we bought from this store made the whole family get the runs. Avoid buying meat from this place. If you plan on buying bread also make sure its not expired.< /review>

<Text>I love KPI! This place is a cook's dream! If you're looking for a huge variety of inexpensive produce this is the place.They also have 1.5 aisles of greens (pea shoots, asian chives++), fresh peas & garbanzos, banana flowers, bok choy (& its ten cousins). Add to that a wall+ of spices & herbs (a couple fresh, the rest dried). Frozen fish & seafood, 6 kinds of tofu, frozen shao mae, fresh & frozen noodles. They just started carrying high quality frozen Indian foods & breads (including 25 packs of frozen paratha. There's tons of frozen foods, like gyoza (chicken, pork, veggies, & combos), AND lumpia...

Let's make this easier: This place is FULL of all kinds of:
• Asian food supplies (like an aisle of soy sauce. Plus prefab tamarind sauce & other Asian sauces;
• Some basic American staples (milk, juices, cheeses, deli meats);
• Some Eastern European (desserts, sausages, pastas & cheeses);
• Hispanic food supplies (canned & dry ingredients and a Tortilleria);
• Fresh meats (all kinds) & seafood.

● EXCEPT for fresh East Indian paneer ●
I haven't found that...ONE...thing. Seriously.

There's also cookware & kitchen tools; sake sets; ramen bowls; an aisle of sauces & soups; tea; alcohol (beer & wine); soda, basic & household items (paper towels++).

OOPS I forgot that there's ALSO an Eastern European bakery; 3-4 cafeteria style restaurants; a jewelry store and a Bubble tea place. I hear they've got the best pho you can find. There's a lot of indoor seating for you to eat at & a gorgeous, waterfall-type fountain you can sit at & listen to it's hypnotic sound.

There's also the most aware, helpful & friendly Security team to keep an eye on you in the parking lot (ladies check out the Security guards cause some of them are HOT). The lot has video cameras too & beautiful lights in all the trees at the holidays. KP Billiards is next door with Manny at the cocktail bar.

Set aside 1-2 hours just to figure out that's in this MASSIVE store. It's open until 10:00PM on some nights.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Rating>5</Rating><Name>Sue Goodrich<//Name><Response>None< /Response>< UserId.>

I say Asian because it has more than just Korean specialties, but Japanese, Indian, and Hawaiian to name a few. The produce includes ingrediants you won't find at your local market, and the meat and fish from the butcher include cuts you won't find even at Seafood City.

The prices were.. understandable, but not cheap. Nothing to complain about when you can't get some items within litterally 100 miles of this place (or out of country).

As a bonus, there is a food court including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and American. Plenty of seating available and attached Korean karaoke, Korean BBQ, and bubble tea restaurants.

Truely a place worthy of 5 stars reviews and your patronage if you are in need of an Asian food fix.< /text><username>Philip Acierto< /username><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

KP Plaza is a wonderful place to find international food staples and specialty grocery items. Inside you will find fresh seafood, specialty cuts of meat, freshly made kimbap and they also have a section making fresh tortillas to take home.

The food court has Mexican, Chinese, Korean food and even has a pastry booth where you can buy a variety of sweets or savory pies to go.  If you would rather eat a little more upscale, you can chose to dine at the Red Alcove an excellant Korean BBQ place or sing karaoke at KP Karaoke both connected to the plaza.

Parking is easy and the Gold line light rail station is right outside making it a convenient stop.<//text>

You can literally get anything here.  We love Koreans Plaza.  Traffic on the inside can be congested and confusing, I prefer shopping in the evening.  We made the mistake of shopping midday Saturday with one of the car carts this weekend and got stuck by the food samples for a while.  The tortillarilla seems to have been removed, which is unfortunate hopefully it will be back.  We have been shopping here since before the addition and I believe Koreana is better than ever.<//review>

The meats are not of great quality, but they do provide cuts that other supermarkets do not like LA Kalbi and bulgogi. Even if the prices were more expensive but the quality of meats were better, then I'd be happy pay it. But it's just better to go to Costco, Nugget or Coop to get better quality meats and fish.

The gallery is decent, but if you're offering Korean food, then maybe it should taste a little more authentic and less fast food-like. Also, maybe having Korean ajummas make the food rather than non-Asian cooks would imropve the quality and authenticity of the Korean food, considering it is a Korean market.< /Text><Time>1548378580305<//Time>< Rating>

Guards ( with no name tag) started telling us to leave because I made a mistake.  We pay money in here every day to be treated badly.  I hope the man who treated us like that gets put on leave cause no one deserves to be treated like that definitely a customer who comes in all the time. They treated us horribly because of soda. I will never ever come here again and I honestly don't recommend eating at there food court.<//Review>< pictures>

I love KPI! This place is a cook's dream! If you're looking for a huge variety of inexpensive produce this is the place.They also have 1.5 aisles of greens (pea shoots, asian chives++), fresh peas & garbanzos, banana flowers, bok choy (& its ten cousins). Add to that a wall+ of spices & herbs (a couple fresh, the rest dried). Frozen fish & seafood, 6 kinds of tofu, frozen shao mae, fresh & frozen noodles. They just started carrying high quality frozen Indian foods & breads (including 25 packs of frozen paratha. There's tons of frozen foods, like gyoza (chicken, pork, veggies, & combos), AND lumpia...

Let's make this easier: This place is FULL of all kinds of:
• Asian food supplies (like an aisle of soy sauce. Plus prefab tamarind sauce & other Asian sauces;
• Some basic American staples (milk, juices, cheeses, deli meats);
• Some Eastern European (desserts, sausages, pastas & cheeses);
• Hispanic food supplies (canned & dry ingredients and a Tortilleria);
• Fresh meats (all kinds) & seafood.

● EXCEPT for fresh East Indian paneer ●
I haven't found that...ONE...thing. Seriously.

There's also cookware & kitchen tools; sake sets; ramen bowls; an aisle of sauces & soups; tea; alcohol (beer & wine); soda, basic & household items (paper towels++).

OOPS I forgot that there's ALSO an Eastern European bakery; 3-4 cafeteria style restaurants; a jewelry store and a Bubble tea place. I hear they've got the best pho you can find. There's a lot of indoor seating for you to eat at & a gorgeous, waterfall-type fountain you can sit at & listen to it's hypnotic sound.

There's also the most aware, helpful & friendly Security team to keep an eye on you in the parking lot (ladies check out the Security guards cause some of them are HOT). The lot has video cameras too & beautiful lights in all the trees at the holidays. KP Billiards is next door with Manny at the cocktail bar.

Set aside 1-2 hours just to figure out that's in this MASSIVE store. It's open until 10:00PM on some nights.<//review>

Huge selection, clean and organized, surprisingly low prices and short checkout line.  Too bad all supermarkets can't be like this place, it's worth the extra drive.</review>

This is a biggest asian supermarket in town. You can find lots of asian or korean food here, including Russian food. The only thing I don't like is the vegetable quality. They are not the freshest vege in town.</Review>

<Review>Never seen a super market not allowing customers to bring drinks in. I had to bring a child to the bathroom and return inside to meet their parents. The security would not allow me back in because I had a drink in my hand. Security was rude and told you like you were stupid. There is no sign at the door. This is the dumbest supermarket. Don't even let your kids walk to the bathroom if you have a drink in your hand. You will not be allowed to go back in.</Review><GmapID>0x809add6cec217ce7:0xd2c4a926a3f8f3ff< /GmapID><rate>1< /rate><Date>1523067145311</Date><UserId.>106721621345374657871<//UserId.>< resp>

<text>This food court has a good variety of foods to choose from (cheap sushi, bento, korean food, etc.). The prices aren't unreasonable, and the food portions are good. That being said, the quality of the food itself leaves something to be desired. The cooks here are mediocre at best. A lot of the food is just bland. But it's food court food, so we don't expect much in the first place. Decent place to grab a bite if you're craving fast korean food.</text>< pictures>

You can find ingredients for virtually every ethnic cuisine here--Korean, Filipino, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Thai, Malaysian, Russian, Indian, Middle Eastern, Latin American, Mexican, etc. Good prices on meat and produce as well. There's a bakery and food court on the other side of the grocery store.< /text>

The market is huge. Everything the have looks fresh. Meaning the veggies & meat. They have alot of variety of foods from korean to mexican and european foods. If I lived closer to this market, it would be my daily go to place for groceries.</review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>I'll start off by saying, this place is "HUGE!" This place has everything that you need to preparing an Asian meal.

I made the mistake of parking, which I thought was the end of the store!  Wrong...  This store runs almost a block long!

This store is like a grocery store, fish market, bakery, etc.  They carry a lot of stuff in bulk which saves money had you made the same purchase in another store.

Their foodcourt has a variety of different meals but leans more towards the Asian cuisine.

I particularly gravitated towards their Korean B-B-Q where every table has a grill right at your table to cook your order.

Overall this is definitely a good place to shop or to grab a bite.< /Review>< Name>

It is a hassle that I can't take my laptop bag with me because store policy prohibits bagpacks. Otherwise the security guards is doing a good job keeping the storefront clean and neat.< /text>

Most, if not all the food served here has msg added to the food. It makes the food taste good but it's bad for people, and I'm allergic to it. Not a lot of options for health conscious people< /Review>

<Text>This place used to serve V9 Xtra large Pho bowl woth enough garnishing and reasonable quantity of rice noodle. But today I was shocked to see a super small noodles flooded with broth. I talked and showed them that this is way too microscopic and told me that they reduced now. But the reduction was cut by 70 %. I normally would not argue something that I eat. So I asked for additional Thai basil and cilantro because you can count the leaves with 1 hand. They told me that they charge extra. I will never return to KPI Food Court and if I crave Vietnamese food, I would go to Pho Fresh. Today is the last. Never again.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< time>

I really love this place for the variety of items available, but had an incident where a security guard harassed me for using a mobility device and bringing groceries to my car. Reported it and management took care of the situation.< /text>

<review>Good mix of Japanese, korean and filipino stuff. The produce can be a bit sketchy, the organic section isnt too bad, i would never touch any of the clearance stuff...ever, it should be trashed. Parking lot is humongous, a plus for me.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Very nice stuff they have over there, however, be prepere to spend some extra money because of the price. Fruits and vegetables are pretty much cheap for a good Quality, while everything else a little pricy. The original name of the place called Korean Plaza, but I was surprised to find some Slavic food over there.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x809add6cec217ce7:0xd2c4a926a3f8f3ff<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

They've got bento boxes, ramen soup, pho, Japanese rolls, skewers, aandwiches, chow mein, roasted duck, twisted potatoes, fried rice and lots more. There's a bakery on the far left as you get inside.  Affordable meals that'll surely fill your appetite. Tables are cleaned regularly and thy have enough seats for the couples, families and for the ones riding solo. There's multiscreen tv for you to watchon while eating or waiting for your folks who are at the grocery.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< rate>

<Review>They run this place like a mom and pop back in Korea. I bought Cham Kimchi  because they were out of my usual Manna brand and it turned out to be 2 weeks old. They told me over the phone to bring it back, and then  when I got there they said that they couldn't refund citing the store policy.  Selling 2 week old Kimchi is a fraud to begin with, and they lied  claiming they never sell 2 weeks old kimchi. What a fraud. I left $18 jar on the counter and left. They wasted not only my $18, but also an hour on 20 mile drive.

I've never had this kind of problem in the South Bay where they have several Korean stores. In Sacramento, this is the only major store and they run it as such.  I can't wait for H-Mart to come  in and give them some competition. Till then, stay away from this place and Cham Kimchi. I'll try Smile Market the next time.</Review>< pictures>

<review>Probably the best all around grocery store in Rancho Cordova. Very good deals on fish, meat, vegetables, and ethnic foods like Indian, Chinese, Korean (of course, in the name!), Russian, and Mexican. Lots of stuff here that you can't typically find at traditional stores, like bittermelons, opo squash, sing qua squash, bok choy. Being Korean in origin, the selection in Korean food is unparalleled for the Sacramento region. The selection of other ethnic foods, especially Asian food, is also impressive. The food court is similarly very large and quite good. For major sporting events and occasions - like the Olympics, World Cup, and Superbowl - this is a nice place to hang out and eat some pretty good food that is fast casual and multiethnic.</review>< pictures>

Not the best Korean market I've been to, but better than nothing. Disappointing produce, almost all shrinkwrapped, limited variety, if you are looking for Korean veg. Many of the people working here know nothing about Korean food. In the fish department, no one knew how to filet a fish! (I do, but I was feeling lazy.) they have removed the live tanks and the fish selection is small unless you are looking for salmon. OTOH, you can get Filipino, Russian, Mexican and more here. Decent selection of Korean basics, including Kimchi from Korea and a local non-MSG variety, but also cheap Kimchi from China.  Overall, I  found this market grimy and unpleasant to shop in. The international variety is interesting, but if you are looking for Korean supplies, you'll do better at Smile. The meat and prepared Banchan are overpriced. I'm always sorry when I decide to shop here, they don't even carry my favorite soju. If you'rr looking for a lot of different stuff you might like it here, but it's not for me. Watch out for the pastry shop. The things I bought were stale, with soggy pastry and dried out fillings.< /review>

Unprofessional staff. They are racist against white peoples,  I literally saw a asian manager hand a white employee a box and when she asked what it was she said "sugar duh" in the most ugliest annoyed voice ever ! As if that poor girl was supposed to be able to see through the brown box and already know that it is sugar. Then the girl turned around and the Asain manager literally made a mocking face at the girl behind her back like a child would! Anyways it's needless to say that the white girl looked stressed out and scared but she was trying her best.</Text>

I wish there was a way to make a negative star rating to this place it is horrible it is not even if you feel dirty when you walk through it and the grocery store there has security guards who are severely overbearing highly entitled and very much I don't even know how to put it but they literally think there's something wrong or not they abused Authority that they don't even have and they are iss entirely not to mention the fact that they're all a bunch of overbearing bullies who like to pick on older people and disabled people such as my brother who had an encounter with one  they shouldn't even have their jobs because they don't know how to treat people sorry I don't make post like this normally but these people really rubbed me the wrong way.< /text>

This place is big. Very good produce section, prices are also low on produce, huge variety of asian goods, they also have hispanic, indian section etc where you can find essential things. Good international selection too. Meat, seafood and poultry section also has veriety of stuff. They have food court, bakery section, bar and restaurant too. I suggest you dont park close to entry gate as this place is big and exit gate if on other side of store, so park somewhere in between. What I did not like is customwr service is not very good and the gaurds or security seems like more of goons. Not very friendly.</review>

I used to like this store but their one way entrance for disabled individuals is discriminating.  You have to walk all the way from Produce to the food court to exit the store when you first entered through the produce department.  There is a rude uneducated Security Officer standing at the entrance door stopping shoppers from exiting through the double doors. Also when you call and speak to the store manager,  your hung on up,  or told to call back.</text>< gmapID>

The grocery store visit was great. My daughter and we're hungry so went to the food court to get something to eat.  I order the spicy seafood soup, tampura and potstickers.  We got tampura and potstickers right away. The soup I had to wait for.  10 minutes later I went to ask for it. Only for them to give me the wrong soup. Instead of hot soup I got a cold one and beef NOT seafood like I order. When I took it back the staff didn't say a word.  I asked for my money back and instead of making feel inportant they just gave me the look like I was the one making the mistake.
Never again will i set foot at this court<//review>

<review>(Translated by Google) If you're a Korean, there are a lot of options to choose all the products cheaper than other places. Above all, I'm so happy to eat Bone Haejangguk. I live back home because I want to eat it.. I don't think it's a waste at all. If you are an hour away, please come here... It feels like an e-mart in Korea.
