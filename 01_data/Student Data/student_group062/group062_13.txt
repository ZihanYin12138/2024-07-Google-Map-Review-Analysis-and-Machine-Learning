Depending on the time of day they can be very slow or very fast. Most of the staff r wonderful but some are extremely rude.

It is located across from Lakewood Hospital in the Starbucks parking lot. It does have easy access and I haven't encountered problems with the parking.< /Review>

This is the slowest place ever, even with an appointment. I only bring my daughter here because so far they are able to effectively draw her blood quickly. But it always take them for ever to call us.< /review>

I drive extra just to come here. My mom loves Candy the nurse that draws her blood. No pain or bruises whatsoever.  If you have an appointment they are super fast. The African American receptionist isn't the friendliest but is super fast and efficient.  Again I drive past maybe 5 or 6 Quest Diagnostics just to come here.<//Text>

<text>Excellent service. I got there 25 minutes before my scheduled appointment at 11:15am and there were only approximately 3 or 4 persons waiting in the lobby. 10 minutes later I was called and  taken into the lab area and 10 minutes after that I was out of there. The staff were very friendly and courteous. Highly recommend this place.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I have been going to this Quest Diagnostics location at least every 2-3 months  for many, many years and I have always been pleased with the service. Unlike other people I have never had to wait very long and I always go on a walk-in basis without an appointment. 15 minutes is the longest I have had to wait & I think that is reasonable. The staff has always been friendly & professional when dealing with me although I think they could smile a bit more. A smile always puts me in a better mood. I am a nurse myself & although the staff here doesn't know that I have been able to evaluate their accuracy on a medical basis due to my profession & I feel they are doing an excellent job.<//review>

Everyone is standing on top of each other. Then I’ve watched 5 of your employees come in after 8am they’re still walking in. The girl who takes the info, late! This makes no sense my daughter is a type 2 diabetic waiting to get her blood drawn. Try calling another quest no answer😡I work at an outpatient lab this is NOT how a draw station should be ran!!!<//Review>< pics>

I figure they are a lab that is strictly for blood work and they should know exactly how much blood needs to be withdrawn for all the tests. So I had to drive from commerce, ca all the way here IN TRAFFIC!! TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL!! UNACCEPTABLE - we have work, things to take care of after a PREVIOUSLY MADE APPOINTMENT- for the staff to be too careless and make us go back to get more blood</review>< rating>

This lab has the most unprofessional staff I've ever encountered. The staff have no customer service or interpersonal skills whatsoever. They certainly have a attitude of "I can't be fired"....Quest Diagnostic (corporate) need fire this current staff and hire ALL new employees.</text>

If you don't want to wait 2hrs+, make an appointment online. Once you arrive sign-in on the tablets. The first time I came it was full and I waited about 20 minutes (made an appt. beforehand). The phlebotomist made the process quick and painless. My second visit wasn't as pleasant. I was called in fairly quickly but had to get both arms punctured because the phlebotomist forgot to fill one of the blood tubes. I didn't mind that so much, though I did get bruises on both arms and that was uncomfortable.<//Review>

Horrible place. The place was packed and nobody had been called in for over 40 minutes.  Then once I complained they magically call 6 people.  The whole time we were there, there was an elderly woman in a wheelchair. ..they should of had some common sense and taken her in when she arrived.  Pathetic!!</Review>

Terrible customer service. Almost every staff member seemed to have some sort of an attitude for whatever reason. Gave them an extra star because I actually heard a "thank you" every so often :b<//text>

Used to go here all the time, but then I noticed the prices were different depending on who was working the counter. The last straw was when I came out to my car and one of the workers had parked so close to my car that I couldn't get in. Then when I asked him to move his car he got angry with me and was cussing at me. Needless to say I haven't been back. And won't go back. I'll spend my $300/week somewhere else.<//Text>

I've lived in the area over 20 years, and this store has always been a nice place to run in and out, hassle free. Friendly, I grabbed ice and drinks last time, they helped me with the ice. Didn't have to, but they did.< /text>

<Review>Im disabled & have known all owners, management, and cashiers etc. They are quiet at first. But the more they see you, and how you behave, talk,smile, and treat them. Then everyone relaxes and conducts buisness as usual.
WATCH OUT ...the employees watch out for customers. And customers WILL DEFEND employees. Do not steal
take, borrow, merchandise please! We all pay for it by owners having to raise the prices. Thank You< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>Diamond is outstanding!  Very serious and somber on the outside,  but funny-as-hell once you get to know him. Miss the old Drive-Through Dairy, but pleased Star Market has set up shop here in our neighborhood.
Two years later and Diamond is now married and a daddy. Congrats!<//text>< time>

< review>
This is a store right around the corner from where I live. It sells liquor and other liquids and snacks. They don't give out any bags. They charge you to get cash back and must have a purchase of 10$ to use a credit card. Often there are homeless people camped out side on the concrete. The owners are foreign born and not very friendly. The parking lot is hard to maneuver your car in. The store is convenient and that is why I frequent it.< /review>

Well they don't explain very well the games being played plus the caller says the numbers to fast. I had won a bingo and they didnt hear me and finally one of the workers yelled for me and the caller callrd it closed. They wouldnt pay me. It wasn't right.< /Text>

Fun experience.  Only $25 for 3 cards and the computers were reasonably priced also. Most game play wins were $250. I liked how you can bring your own food, snacks and drinks inside. Will be going back</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Last minute car tint request and it’s Tint Pros for the win!  Called Tint Pros at 12:30 today and thanks to a last second cancellation they were able to fit us in. Picked up the car at 3:00 and all 6 windows were tinted just as requested. I know their workmanship is quality since we’ve done about 10 vehicles tints here over the years.  I wasn’t expecting them to fit us in today but they did. From scheduling to completed job Tint Pros is the best. Don’t go anywhere else!! Thanks Tint Pros!</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Business owners are friendly/professional and most important to me was they actually knew their product. They also stand behind their work.< /review>

Needless to say my tint looked pretty good from afar. However when you got closer you see massive amounts of bubbles, edges that are cut way too high so light can get through. The cut on the corners were terrible enough that tint was placed on the outside of the window to cover the messed up cut that was done on the initial tint. The vent wing window lines are all crooked and the tint on those are peeling off. The driver rear door tint is pulling off because i'm guessing the window wasn't properly cleaned. All in all the tint cost me over 315$ and the quality of work done is terrible. I am getting it redone tomorrow in hopes that it will be done right. So I will re-post tomorrow night if these issues have been taken care of.< /Text>

Top-notch experience from beginning to end!
Dr. Bajwa is polite, thoughtful and professional.
His staff, Lisa and Corrine, are thorough, friendly and knowledgeable. I was very pleased with my experience and highly recommend Buena Vista Optometry!< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I am a 29 year old Male and Haven’t had an eye exam in over 7 years,...I  was very surprised of how high tech the office and equipment were...the staff were friendly and efficient, as was the Optometrist, who was extremely knowledgeable as well. He explained step by step of what was going down...very educational!! I have the perfect pair of glasses currently(besides the small crack on top) I wasn’t considering changing frames but the lovely ladies at reception were very friendly and very stylish...they were able to find the perfect frame for me that suits my high octane lifestyle. I highly recommend this place and I look forward to going there for the rest of my life!!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Caring, professional, knowledgeable, helpful and courteous, can be applied to the whole process of an “office visit”  from all staff to the doctor. I came back for a regular exam after a family member was seen for an urgent eye injury and was treated fast and successfully.  Thank you!!< /text>

<Review>I took my son to another optometrist 6 months ago who said he was fine after only 10 minutes, but I still had hesitations. We decided to go to this optometrist and they spent an hour and a half getting to the bottom of my concerns and discovered my son did need glasses. So great full that they took the time and effort to get an accurate prescription.< /Review><userid>117142143698079634725< /userid>< Name>

First time coming  here and was very impressed with Dr. Bajwa and his staff. The Dr was very thorough and took the time to expalin my eye health. All was very professional but at the same time a very friendly and relaxed atmosphere. It was an enjoyable visit. I will be recommending this officer and Doctor to family and friends.

He walked me through every step of the procedures and told me real-time what the results were. The staff at Buena Vista is also excellent. They are good at communicating with you before and after appointments and really know eye wear and insurance plans.

<Review>Great experience! From the minute I walked in I was greeted by Kathy. She was very friendly and helpful. I just needed new lenses for my old frames and she guaranteed they would be finished in 15 minutes. Everything was handled quickly and I was even offered water while I waited.  All around great experience. Will definitely come back!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>I’ve been going to Dr. Bajwa for 2 years and am so impressed. He is an excellent optometrist. He is friendly, thorough, he explains everything in great detail, I have never felt as though he needed to rush off somewhere else, and he is 100% professional. His office staff is similarly fantastic, friendly, and professional. I would absolutely recommend him to friends and family.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>Dr. Bajwa was very helpful in ensuring my questions would be answered. He walked me through the entire eye examination and explain each process clearly. The Front Desk Receptionist, Pam, was also very helpful and helped me with the paperwork required in transferring into this location. The optical lens specialist, Liz, helped me select the perfect frame for my head-shape and gave me various options. Her expertise helped me find glasses that not only helped me see better but look better! Very happy with my first experience here!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80e9ad5b82ff6fb1:0xe62c9a3273b829d9<//gmap_id></record>

Broke my glasses just before vacation.  Maria got us an appointment right away. Dr. Bajwa gave an excellent exam.  He was very thorough and he explained everything along the way.  Lisa helped with choosing new frames and lens particulars. I needed a rush on the glasses and Lisa contacted the lab for accelerated production.  Glasses fit wonderfully, the prescription was spot-on, and I received the glasses in time for vacation.</review>

<Text>Went here for a rare and serious condition affecting the shape of the retina.  11 out of 10, the entire staff was professional and went out of their way to ensure that patients are comfortable.  The doctor is extremely knowledgeable,  takes the time to confirm and explain your particular condition and options.  They have some very high end equipment and were able to take 3D pictures of the inside of the eye right in the office.  Highly recommended for anyone who needs an optometrist they knocked the ball right out of the park.  As a cash payer I was surprised how reasonable the fees were given the cost of the equipment they have.  A+< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Don't expect much from this place. They are so conditioned with taking your insurance money that they don't add much more, like call you back when your eyewear is in, listen to what you really need, or work with you when you want to purchase eyewear elsewhere because they don't carry it. They will make it more difficult than needed. I didn’t ask for any fees to be waived, I just wanted a complete prescription for glasses and the owner just wanted to argue without offering a solution. I would have paid if they offered the service to me rather than telling me to go elsewhere. I’m sure the owner won’t offer to help in a reply either- just try to justify his poor customer service without offering a solution. Rather than trying to help, it was a complete fail on his part.
Update: I went to Lenscrafters and they took care of me for free.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1568852994876, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback.\nI’m sorry your experience was less than exceptional.

<Review>Reception/intake folks smile when they greet you, make you feel genuinely welcome, they don’t make you feel out forms all over when everything is still the same.
Dr Bajwa is thorough.
He explains different tests.
3 years ago he explained what this test did; gave a full view of the retina, which was $100., not covered by insurance or do the traditional covered test not as extensive.
We opted for the extensive test & glad we did.
Additionally, I did some research on eye questions and came prepared with questions on my visit the following year and Dr. B took the time to answer each question completely. He did it all with a great attitude.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1530977995831, 'text': 'Hi Irene! Thank you for the review.

<pics>None< /pics><Text>I found them through google reviews.  I was very happy I did.  I had another experience in Ventura a few years back and realized I needed someone who was a private practice doc with access to top tech for glasses and prescription.

Staff is WONDERFUL!  AND I mean wonderful!  Very pleasant, helpful, easy to talk to, also will give you advice in picking out specs which is huge....tough to do it alone.

They have an excellent assortment of glasses to choose from and explain options very clearly.  I really appreciated this as well, their knowledge helped me to easily pick what I needed for glasses to last a long time.

Dr. Bajwa is professional, friendly, knowledgeable, and kind.  I really liked that he took the time to explain things to me.

I will be back regularly for annual exams (first time in my life) and appreciate knowing I am in good hands.

Also, they now take pics of your eyes to compare them to year after year for further diagnosis and care.  Bonus, great idea!  They have a nifty machine they use to do this.

Thank you very much for giving me such a great experience.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<text>My experience with Dr. Bajwa and his office was excellent. I found Dr. Bajwa to be very professional, thorough, and kind. I have developed a new issue in one of my eyes, while not the biggest issue, it was concerning to me, & without prompting, he spent extra time to find it, explain it thoroughly, and schedule a follow up appointment. His office staff were equally as professional, helpful, and kind. Their selection of glasses is extensive & fashionable. The staff were fun to engage with, and especially helpful in helping me to find a new pair glasses that were flattering to me.< /text><Rating>5</Rating><Pics>None<//Pics>< Name>

<Text>I've been a patient of Dr Bajwa for several years already. He's always provided excellent care! He is very thorough with his examinations, is very informative, explains and summarizes my visit in terms that I can understand, and provides great bedside manners. I have horrible astigmatism and have been difficult to fit for contacts, but Dr Bajwa has fitted me with gas permeable lenses that provide me with  optimum vision. Thank you so much for all that you do for me and for your patients. From one satisfied and grateful patient, thank you for everything you do!< /Text>< pictures>

I've been a patient of Dr Bajwa for several years already. He's always provided excellent care! He is very thorough with his examinations, is very informative, explains and summarizes my visit in terms that I can understand, and provides great bedside manners. I have horrible astigmatism and have been difficult to fit for contacts, but Dr Bajwa has fitted me with gas permeable lenses that provide me with  optimum vision. Thank you so much for all that you do for me and for your patients. From one satisfied and grateful patient, thank you for everything you do!<//Review>

My eye doctor retired and referred me to this office, I was a little leary since I had not seen a new provider in a very long time.  I find the doctor to be very kind and has made me feel very comfortable during my eye exam.  I do not feel uncomfortable or leary.<//review><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

Love this place!  Dr. Kumata is fabulous.  And my son met and instantly bonded with Dr. Cazar!  I lost my glasses this week and she was so  helpful at fitting and ordering me a new pair.  Thank you Ventura Optometric Vision Care!< /Review>

This place is great! Dr Bajwa is a fantastic dr! He was patient and explained everything thoroughly at the completion of my eye exam. He recommended helpful treatments in order for me to be more preventative towards my various diagnoses. His office provides new technology to better monitor eye diseases such as glaucoma and macular degeneration; which run in my family. His office has a great staff as well as a plentiful selection of frames for glasses. I’ll be bringing the rest of my friends and family to this office for sure!< /Text>

Dr. Bajwa and the entire staff at Buena Vista are AMAZING!!!  Dr. Bajwa is very caring and will spend as much time as you need to discuss the health of your eyes.  Not only that, he's got a great personality!  All the ladies in the office are so much fun as well!  I highly recommend Dr. Bajwa and Buena Vista Optometry!</Text>

Dr Bajwa ,
Is awesome, I've been dealing with an eye issue for a while now & have been thru a couple Dr's and he is the most concerned one I have found,thank you Dr for being so thorough :)😁😊</Text>

<text>Dr. Bajwa was great! I had gone to Dr. Hatcher for over 20 years, until he retired & turned the practice over to Dr Bajwa. The first visit I had with Dr. Bajwa about 3-4 years ago was “just ok”.  He was technically competent but was not very personable; although, granted, he had just taken over the practice & likely had a lot going on in his life at the time. Today’s visit was much different. Dr. Bajwa was still technically competent and was very personable!  The office is clean & comfortable.  The Optition, Lisa, took care in getting me the right frames and lens options. I highly recommend Buena Vista Optometry!<//text>< userid>

Dr. Ranjeet Bajwa Was great! He explained what he was doing thoroughly so that I could understand. Made me feel comfortable and is pretty funny too. The staff is great at explaining my insurance coverage and my scheduling needs. Thank you.

So an update.. I woke up with this awful crusty grossness coming out of my eye and soreness. I was able to get ahold of Dr. Bajwa super easy on a Sunday! After talking with him he called in a prescription to my pharmacy. Just having an eye exam within the year kept that door open for when life happens. So glad I didn’t have to go to urgent care.< /text>

Excellent staff and service advisors. Had the body of my car repaired. Staff did an excellent job on reaching out to my insurance after the initial consultation and receiving of my car. Then throughout the process they constantly gave updates every few days con the status of repairs but also any changes that needed to be made. In addition not only reaching to myself but then with a day getting an update from my insurance from their quick.
After receiving my car at the facility they were quick, friendly, and very knowledgeable in answering every question I had including going into detail/showing me  everything that was done. Definitely top m\notch service/customer service. Would definitely recommend this body shop to others.<//Text>

Getting my vehicle fixed at this shop was a very pleasant experience. The repair took a reasonable amount of time and the work was quality from the metal repair to the finish on the paint. They have a lifetime warranty so you dont have to worry about issues down the road with workmanship.  The facility was clean and all the staff was friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend if you have an accident to take your car here.< /review>

I doubt anyone "enjoys" having a fender bender, but as soon as my insurance company referred me to Caliber, they treated me with respect and courtesy.  Enrique at Caliber stayed in frequent contact about the progress on my car and it was fixed perfectly and on time.  I am completely satisfied with their work and communication with me and will be back if I ever need body work again!  Thank you Enrique and Keri!<//review>

I highly recommend this company! The staff there is incredibly friendly, knowledgable, thorough, and timely! I had a car accident a couple months ago and dragged my feet on getting the auto body repairs done, thinking I might get taken advantage of or it would be another stressful experience. However, Caliber Collision made my car repair experience incredibly easy and pleasant from the moment I contacted them! My car looked amazing upon receipt and I am so excited to be driving it again looking. They are a top notch auto repair shop that I will definitely be using again in the future and recommending to others! I specifically worked with Frank and Francisco and couldn't be happier with their service.</text>

Caliber kept me informed from beginning to end. The entire process was seamless and the final product was more than expected. If I had to take any of my vehicle's for repairs I would with out a doubt take it to Caliber Collision in Palm Desert.

I want to say that I know nothing about what to look for regarding a quality repair.  As long as the paint looks shiny and matches the rest of the car then I am happy.  That repair part of the car looks flawless.  The reason why I am giving 5 stars is because of the friendly experience that I had with everyone involved from start to finish at Caliber Collision. Of course everyone was professional and knowledgeable as expected from a large company.  The thing that I was impressed with was their ability to talk in a way that I could understand. I was kept updated every day on the status of my repairs but I wasn't drowned in technical jargon. The service advisor really knows how to talk to their clients to make them feel involved in the process.  I don't know anyone that chooses to go to a body shop but if you have a choice on where to go this is the one.<//Review>

<text>The repairs were excellent! What I was really impressed upon was the ability of Caliber Collision to get my claim paid.  I was hit by someone insured by The General and they did not want to pay for the damages to my whip. The staff at Caliber were able to get the insurance company to fork over the money necessary to process the claim. My car would still be sitting on the side of the road if it wasn't for their persistence. These guys really know what they are doing.</text>< gmap_id>

These guys are the best! I went from shop to shop getting prices to fix my parking boo boo. I received a wide range or prices and time frames for fixing my bumper and fender. When I came to Caliber I had already been to a couple other shops so when they gave me a price that was cheaper  and told me they could get it done in a couple days my mind was made up.  On top of great price and timely repair they had a really clean facility.  They are clearly keeping up with the Covid-19 sanitation and I was told that they do the same inside the vehicle before and after the repair to ensure no germs.</text>

<text>I took my 2020 BMW to get an estimate after a tumbleweed scratched the paint.  When I saw a brand new Mercedes S560 and another high end Audi on the lot I knew this shop would be capable of my repairs.  When they told me they offer a life-time guarantee on the work my mind was made up.  The price exceeded my expectation and the vehicle was returned to me much sooner than I had anticipated. Hopefully nothing ever happens to my vehicle but if it does I know where to go in Palm Desert.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1593020302785, 'text': "Hi Ashley, thank you for your wonderful comments!

<Date>1593101076520< /Date><Rating>5</Rating><review>Up until now I had never been in an accident so I only had second hand stories about car repair to base my opinion prior to coming to Caliber. Let's just say that Caliber changed my expectations in the best way possible. I was met with friendly faces, who made me feel welcomed and explained the entire process. I was kept informed during the various stages of repair, and my vehicle was done before the due date. Since I didnt have a rental vehicle the employees even arranged to drop my completed vehicle off at my house to save me from having to Uber or bum a ride. I cant even tell that my vehicle was in an accident which makes the whole experience 5 stars for sure< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Recently I came back to my Lexus and found that someone had scraped the passenger side while it was parked. Of course no note was left so I had to file a claim through my own insurance. The folks at Caliber Collision were extremely helpful in explaining the process of getting my vehicle repaired.  My two concerns were quality of repairs and the length of time the car spent in the shop.  I have been to other repair facilities in the past but was never really understood what was happening to my vehicle up until now. The service advisors made sure that I was kept informed and made to feel comfortable that my vehicle was in good hands. Not only was the vehicle completed in about a week, but they even went the extra mile to clean a stain out of the carpet obviously unrelated to the claim. Due to this experience Caliber has earned my business for anything car related.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1592943369429, 'text': "Hi John, thank you for your wonderful comments!

Because of the damage to my vehicle by this shop, verified by a State Farm adjuster, I had to have "Corrective repairs"  totaling over $900.00 completed at another shop.  Caliber only paid for a rental car for less than half the time the corrective repairs took, leaving me without a car for five days. Further, Caliber billed SF for repainting the hood, but in fact did not.  I gave Caliber two chances to correct the damage they caused, and they were unsuccessful.  They painted my passenger door, up to the bumper, but DIDN'T MATCH THE FACTORY TEXTURE! The buffing to the paint was so bad the entire front and bumper were striped like a tiger. My car looked horrible.  I would have just walked away and let the other shop fix the damage Caliber caused, but the level of denial I received and refusal to accept responsibility and to cover a rental compelled me to share my experience. There are other SF authorized shops in Palm Desert.  Why take the chance the same will happen to you.  I wish I could have given this shop less than one star because that was a gift.< /text>
<pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1583940313307, 'text': 'I am sorry for your horrible experience that was never the intention.  From our understanding you were unwilling to have Caliber Collision correct the swirl marks so you took your vehicle to another shop.  We agreed with State Farm that we would pay the other shop $620.46 for the quote to repair.  Based off that quote to repair the shop needed the vehicle 2 days so Caliber Collision agreed to pay for 4 days of rental.  It was my understanding at this point that we had financially taken care of our responsibility to restore your vehicle. Please let us know if there was something more that could have been done on our end to make your experience better.'}<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dafc259a89cc53:0xd15bc4473b765500<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I just bought a Toyota mirai and damaged my bumper. Shop was able to fix the bumper. Shop saved me money and time by fixing it rather than replacing it. Time saved was very helpful due to me being a traveling musician with booked gigs all over western United States.
Shop staff was helpful and gave me a curtesy ride back and forth from my hotel. Can you believe they fixed it and painted in 1 day. I dropped it off on monday and was done early Tuesday
I had a good feeling about the shop when I pulled in I saw nothing but high end vehicles< /text>< time>

HAD TO HAVE BUMPER ON MY 2012 MBZ. RESULT WAS OUTSTANDING. CAR LOOKS BRAND NEW. THEY DID A WONDERFUL DETAILING JOB BEFORE RETURNING IT TO ME. ONLY GLITCH WAS SMALL DELAY DUE TO OBTAINING INSURANCE APPROVAL ON SOME PART CHANGES.
5 STAR PERFORMANCE BY EVERYONE AT THE SHOP.< /review>

I have been a customer of Spencer Auto Body for over 5 years. I would NEVER take my car anywhere else! They are professional, honest and fair. They were so kind and polite when they did my estimating (both times)! There were no surprises, no hidden fees or additional costs that can somehow show up later. Their work is excellent, when they are finished, you cannot tell that some idiot hit you! I would not hesitate to refer my family, friends and clients to Spencer Auto Body because I know they will always do a great job.< /Review>

I took my grandmother in to get her a new SIM card, and not only did the employee give us the new SIM free of charge, but he took the time to walk her through how to use her phone! Many, many thanks to Albert from the bottom of our hearts!< /Review>< gmapID>

<Text>Just got a phone call from Verizon saying I owe $188 dollars and to verify my account. I haven’t even got my phone yet or started using their service. A phone that they were supposed to have for me on the 5th and never once did I receive an update. How do I have a Bill when I haven’t even started their service and I told them I didn’t want a phone from them anymore so lady starts backtracking and says let me get you customer service. No updates whatsoever on phone or anything. I get a call from Verizon saying I owe them tell them no, they send me to customer service and place me on hold for 20 min so I hung up not paying for something I never got and disappointed I’ll stay with my current carrier if this id the way Verizon operates. They say whatever to get u to sign up and don’t live up to their end of the bargain and try to charge you for it after they dropped the ball. Im not accepting a company that calls me then places me on hold when they can’t answer my questions for 20 min with no information.< /Text><name>Tyler Leibowitz</name></record>

Verizon was great when it comes to customer service and attention given to specific subjects. We were very please. However, their prices are way too high on services offered. I wish they could be more competitive with other cell phone companies.</review>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>Verizon needs to open more locations. I've waited over an hour and a half to be helped with a couple simple questions. Staff here is polite most of the time, but when I asked the manager David why I have not been helped after an hour and a half, he told me that I could leave and come back later if I couldnt "handle" the wait... this was on a Thursday night. There is staff sitting at the counters on their phones that could be helping. Hope management sees this review...< /review><userid>100452671600289821629<//userid>< user_name>

I will stick with AT&T after being treated like that. I went into this store on the advisement of Verizon customer support. We were going to transfer 6 lines from at&t to Verizon but not all parties are present and some are in other states.  Customer service advised us to go into a verizon store to get the cards otherwise we would wait for mail. None of us could go without service for that long. The man that "helped" me refused to help me unless I would give my social sec number. I explained what Verizon customer service told me and then he told me he would open the account. It sucks that their sales people are commission based and are willing to screw people over.</text>

<resp>None< /resp><Pics>None<//Pics><user>115225712429358277282< /user><Review>My family was being helped by an associate named Daniel and we wanted to sign up for the family plan. Simple right? Well Daniel made it sound even simpler when explaining the details of the plan, or so we thought. When we get the bill after signing up for the family plan, the bill was over $50 then what Daniel said it would be. So we call the store but each time Daniel was either busy or on lunch. It was pretty clear Daniel was avoiding my family's calls.
Here's the deal here, the sales team will gloss over small details and put their customers down for options they were never told about in order to charge the customers some extra cash in the hopes that customers will either never notice why they are being charged more or give up on trying to fix it and just pay the extra charge.
My family eventually fixed the problem, but it should have never been there in the first place. What Daniel did was slimy, but I'm sure he's just keeping in line with what the rest of the sales team do when dealing with customers.
So in short, don't give these people your time of day. They intentionally gloss over important payment details in the hopes you pay for it without you knowing it.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
We recently upgraded our phones and the experience was pleasant and professional. We upgraded to the Samsung S10 and sold the Invisashield protection for the screen because there is currently no completely encased case for the phone. We were skeptical because everyone we know who had this complained that it always comes of because of curved screen. The associate said it will not come off and that he would install it for us. We are still grateful for his help. The next day the film was already coming off so we returned and was told by two different associates that if we wanted it to to be fixed we need to take it to Invisashields kiosk in the West Covina Mall, and my reply was " If I have to go to West Covina to have it done properly I might as well purchase my phones at the Verizon store as well so that I can avoid making unnecessary trips back and forth" I live near to the Glendora store. They did reimburse us for the shield and good thing because the kiosk has more choices and would have charged to install the one we purchased from Verizon. To make a long story short, if you are going to purchase a device and are being sold Invisashield go to the Verizon store in the mall and then walk to the kiosk and have it installed correctly if you want it done right. After the kiosk operator installed it you can't even tell that there is a shield on it no bubbles or peeling. Avoid the stress one stop shopping at the mall.</Review>

I've been here many times and usually deal with a different employee (which means I'm a "new" customer to each employee I meet.) I haven't had any consistent problems with this location. People judge others too harshly so here's my counter-review attempting to balance the 1-star reviews a little.<//Review>

They are so nice here. I got my new phone and I love it, except it's too big, but that's not their fault. They helped me look at lots of different options and pick the phone and plan that were right for me and my family. I thought I was saving big holding onto an unlimited plan, but turns out I was overpaying. Thanks Verizon. Yoser did an awesome job helping us! Thanks Yoser!< /Text>

Well, I just updated my review from three (3) to five (5) stars and Van essay is the reason.  Totally cheerful, courteous & made for a pleasant experience at the Glendora store!</Text>

The staff will constantly contradict themselves, give you dirty salesmen tactics, and treat you like dirt.. I have never had a good experience here and I will never return to this location. There is many other of Verizon's locations to go to. Do not go to this location. Save yourself the peace of mind.< /Review>< Pics>

First Bad Customer Service Experience I Have Ever Had With Verizon

Yesterday, I was so greatly helped by Sales Associate Alexyz from the Glendora store, not. I went to the store in order to upgrade my phone to the Galaxy Note 9. When I checked the App, I was told that I only owed $240 and was eligible for an upgrade as long as I traded in my phone. When went into the store though it became complicated in order to do so. After being provided a few options, Alexyz made it clear to me that I couldn't leave the store with a new phone without having to pay $200+ and I couldn't apply it to my next bill. Needless to say I walked out the store with my old phone, exclaiming to the rest of the store that I would make it happen at the online Verizon store. Later that evening I received a text from Alexyz:

Hi, this is Alexyz here from Verizon. Come visit us at the Glendora Marketplace store to chat about the great items saved in your cart. (FreeVzMsg) Would you like me to book an appt 1-4pm M-Sa or 2-4pm Su to visit my store? If not, what time/day works? Reply "E" to unsubscribe to this message.(FreeVzMsg)

However, by this point I have already ordered the phone online for $125 and trade-in(after I receive my new phone). Plus they added the $125 to my next bill. I dont think I'm ever going into a Verizon store again. They're obviously not trying to help customers, just meet sales quotas.</text>

Zero stars if possible.  All smiles and helpfulness from salesman Chase until I refused to add over $90 in unneeded and overpriced accessories.   Then he tried to slap on insurance that I didn't ask for, stating I could take it off in a month if I didn't want it.  I said I didn't want it period, and just wanted to buy the phone please.  After a few sarcastic and condescending remarks made by him, as if I didn't know what was good for me, I said that I should have just gone to Best Buy.  He then invited me to do just that, and very rudely said "Are you OK, Matt?"  I left and went to Costco across the street and was out of there in 15 minutes with the phone I wanted and no issues whatsoever.  I should have known better.  Absolutely the most unpleasant and most disrespectful customer service I have ever encountered.  I guess the fact that I was buying a cheaper model phone for my wife and declined all their upsell attempts meant I wasn't worth Chase's time or trouble.< /Text>

The customer service in this store is horrible, I spoke with Gabriella who is a manager . After 3 hours in the store she still could not resolve the problem. I will never go to this store again. People tell me that you can get better service at the store on Grand.<//text>

Usually a long wait and this store sometimes had odd sales requirements such as having to buy accessories to upgrade. Costco is right across the street and I've had much better deals and service there than this store when considering the same equipment.< /text>

DO NOT COME HERE !!! NOW THAT VERIZON OFFERS THE UNLIMITED PLAN, MANY PEOPLE ARE COMING TO THIS STORE TO UPGRADE. THE REPS WILL SELL YOU STUFF LIKE  A "JETPACK" MOBILE HOTSPOT, IN ORDER TO GET THE UNLIMITED PLAN. THIS IS NOT NECESSARY!!!  YOU DON'T NEED TO BUY OR GET ANYTHING EXTRA. DO THE UPGRADE ONLINE AND SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE AND MONEY. IN FACT, SOME OF THE REPS HAVE AN ATTITUDE, THEY ACT LIKE A.. HOLES! SORRY FOR WRITING IN CAPS. BUT THIS PLACE MADE ME REALLY UPSET ! STAY AWAY.</Text>

The wait is horrid, even when there isn't a lot of people.  Last time I visited, I waited for nearly 15min just to buy an accessory for my phone.  One of the sales staff was chatting it up with some friend who must have been visiting and totally ignored me until I practically made it obvious that I was upset.  Go elsewhere...<//text>

Firt time taking my princess and last! I normally go with a different groomer. But since this place is closer to home. I thought I gave it a try. I was very disappointed. My princess came out looking the same as when I drop her off. Just smelling good! Not sure 🤔.</Review>

<review>This place is my new most favorite place! The people are all far and above great.  Friendly, truly friendly. Not just friendly because they want my money. Truly nice. They are always really sweet to my stinky little guy Bentley. He hates going in the car. So he's shaking like a little leaf by the time he gets there. They are just so patient and unhurried.  And the way he looks and smells when I puck him up. Well. He's awesome! I cannot recommend them more highly.< /review>< response>

Staff was very patient with our anxious dog. She growled a bit but the employee just took her time building rapport and I am very grateful. She came out looking great and with a nice scent of orange (you get to choose).</Text>

Amanda was very professional and they did an excellent job! Our stud muffins look and smell great! Thank you Debi for being patient with Dexter (he doesn't let anyone touch his paws) but she got the job done 😅 very pleased and will be back soon. Highly recommend.</Text>

The Doggie Spa is hands down the BEST grooming facility I have ever been to. Amanda is always so sweet and helpful my dogs love her. My last visit Debbie and Karina groomed my husky and retriever they looked fabulous. You can tell the staff really loves and cares for the animals. I am a huge fan of this place!!< /review>

I really like Doggie Spa because of its atmosphere, the good customer service and how wonderful my dogs look after they are groomed (and I don't bring my dogs in every 1-2 months like I should). They do an Excellent Job and I can't believe the  prices! There are other grooming shops that I have tried in Riverside but I will drive to corona just because of their overall service and pricing.< /review>

First timer at this place and I love it.
My pitbull puppy so was happy and looked so comfortable when I picked him up, he was sitting on the lap of the front desk lady lol.
I recommend going here, you can tell they love  animals. You'll feel at ease leaving your baby with them.< /review>

Always do a great job with my pug. They are extremely honest. I've requested anal glands to be squeezed and nails to be grinded and when I go to pay I have not been charged because those items were not needed. I will continue to use them and would recommend their services.< /text>

Going to find another groomer!
Usually they are great but it’s very hard to make an appointment. Even though I’ve had times where i made an appointment and had to cancel but I couldn’t even call to let them know. There should be someone that answers the phone to make appointment. I called today to get an appointment and the answering machine says we will call you back in 24 hours. That’s unacceptable, i called another day and they didn’t even call me back.
Also had one rude lady, when they didn’t cut my dog’s hair the way I wanted. She didn’t listen just “ya yayed” me.< /Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>I was so upset when I picked up my Japanese Chin and they had pretty much shaved her instead of listening to my instructions to just trim her. The explanation I got was, I thought that was a strange cut for a Japanese Chin. I don't think the groomer knew how to cut any other way. I told them I would never bring her back there again because it was the second time it happened. They just don't listen nor do they seem to know how to style a dog to their breed. Never heard from them to at least apologize for their error.  There wasn't any concern from the person running the front desk or from the groomer.

Read Yelp reviews, I quit using this place when they left my dog on the table unattended. If she would have jumped she would have broken her trachea. I have heard so many horror stories since then. This is a training school, the people training work on your dog. There is no excuse for the irresponsible behavior. If you see a dog running around in the area, it probably escaped there. When the owner ran her business from her home, it seemed like a spa. Now it is dirty, loud and the staff does not care.<//text>

I found this scab on my puppy 2 days after being groomed. #1 The deeply cut my dog #2 They didn't even bother to tell me!!!! I will never go back, my heart breaks that I didn't read the reviews on this place, apparently they have cut MANY MANY dogs. NEVER AGAIN!!! PLEASE CHECK YELP REVIEWS, MANY GRAPHIC PICTURES OF THE ABUSE THAT HAPPENS HERE. Also they charged me early for the subscription I had for weekly baths, they realized the mistake and canceled it yet failed to make me aware. Instead I got a call from my bank about possible fraud.
Another time I took lunch at work to go pick my dog up and turns out they hadn't even washed him yet! So I took my lunch to pick him up when he wasn't even ready!!! They confused him with another dog. Good god what if I took the dog that wasn't mine ?!? No check of ID or anything!!! If I wernt a decent human I could've taken someone's dog! After me threatening to sue them they returned my money but not without threating me personally. An employee told me to watch out that she knows me and my address! I cannot believe I was threatened by doggie spa like this!! So blown away and working on a case with  The Better Business Bureau ! So many claims against them it isn't even funny. But don't take my word for it! Check Yelp!< /text>

OMG
I didn't know you could learn to groom from a mail order correspondence course
If all they know how to do is groom Yorkies then they should tell the public
I brought my two labradoodles in for a bath and clip and a trim
I told the girl that  I wanted the $22.00 service
They had gotten up on the hill so yes they were dirty (that's why we're here) She told me there would be a &7:00 extra charge because they were extra dirty ? which I had no problem with
My problem :  when I explained what I wanted there was no mention that the $22:00 dollar sevvice she suggested over the phone was now going to be $45:00 She neglected to mention that the service we discussed did not include the clip
Secondly my dogs do not resemble the dogs I left there AT ALL
They look rediculous
I'm not sure what they did  to them they shaved their faces down to skin almost not the same length across either
I do know my 9 year old kid could have done as lousy a job as they did
WHAT A JOKE
They don't look like any breed I know of
THIS IS THE LAST TIME they will get my money
I will make sure any dog lover I meet hears this
A visit for two dogs that was supposed to be $45:00 ended up being $90:00
The ten dollar bill I got back from my $100:00 went straight into my pocket NOT the tip jar
Let me give the rest of you a tip
STAY AWAY
My wife just pointed out that their nails didn't get clipped  no bandanas and the privacy shave is literally 6 inches by 8 inches
WHAT A JOKE!!!!!!!<//Review>

I will never go back.  I brought in my sheltie and poodle to be groomed on the same day.  I told the young girl who greeted me exactly how I wanted each of them groomed.  When I arrived to pick them up I realized they had given my sheltie the cut they were suppose to give my poodle.  they shaved my beautiful longhaired sheltie down to her skin.  The only explanation I got was Gee I thought that was a strange cut for a sheltie. When I asked why they didn't just call me to confirm that was really what I wanted I just got blank stares.  I am furious with them especially since the groomer has worked on my sheltie several times and knows exactly how I like her groomed.  My lesson is always talk directly to the groomer< /review>

Hands down the best shop on the block! Out of all the shops on recycle rd Sacramento Auto Dismantling has the best customer service and the largest inventory of vehicles in stock all around. Called prior to going in for multiple parts and they had them all off, cleaned, and ready for pick up. Super fast, super easy, super friendly, and super professional. Contact them for all you used auto part needs. Will definitely go there first no matter what. Thanks guys</Review>

< review>
so I went in looked at a complete motor with harness everything but the ac compressor and the alternator. asked the guy if it comes with the throttle body he says yes so I paid him said I will take it .  So then some old guy who works there starts talking to him in another language seemed upset.   They bring the motor out to my truck load it up and when I get it home the wiring harness was all hacked up and the old guy had them take the throttle body off and the water pump . says in the receipt that it was included went back and asked for the parts wait 45 minutes the bring out some old crusty parts that did not come off that motor.   They brought out another wiring harness and It was the wrong one. shady people definitely won't buy anything from them in the future.
I definitely would not recommend!< /review>

Called them ahead of time to make sure they had the part a was looking for, and they confirmed they did. I then drove across town in traffic and they did not have the part I asked for. The people at the front desk were very rude and had zero customer service skills. Wouldn't go back...<//review>

<review>Best Auto Parts Store To Go To. Just want to leave my honest opinion on here. Needed some parts for two of my car, one was a 2006 Ford F150 fender , they had it in stocked, pulled it off for me quickly. Had another car, a 2004 Honda civic i needed a motor, they had just got the car in, they tested the motor in front of me, and pulled it out the same day just to make sure i was i was a happy and satisfied customer. They have the best prices and they're cheaper then the dealer,  The staff members were awesome helped me out with everything and answered all my question.</review>< resp>

Very unprofessional. Call for a part and I’ll because I said I found a cheaper on eBay this employee decide to call me to tell me the difference between an original equipment and aftermarket like if I didn’t know. Then proceed to text me with unappropriate language. Very very bad for a business<//text>

Very reliable and efficient shop. I don’t buy parts from anywhere so I’ve done my research and tested the waters to find this shop always has what I need when I need it, and they are very professional. They’ve done work for family members as well as myself and it has always been a good experience. Went in cus i needed a front side fender for my Nissan Altima a few days ago and Sam made sure to find me the part asap and give me quality care. Him and the team make the experience easy and quick. 100% recommend.<//Text>

I drove over 200 miles in one direction to get to this place since they had a front seat and panel for my car. All it took was a few bolts to get out what I wanted. It took them a hour to get me pictures of the parts I was wanting. I waited for another hour then left after they told me they’ll have it ready in 45 minutes I came back an hour later giving them 15 minutes more and they still didn’t get the car off the rack. I proceed to wait longer with them saying they would have the parts in a few minutes, before I left they still never got the car off the rack. Not only did I leave unsatisfied, there were people others that left before I did without getting any part due to not receiving parts by the time they were told. Additionally, the part were pricy, but you can negotiate, but you’ll be luck if you ever receive the part.<//Text>

What a great place to go.  We have been going there for all of our parts for the Honda's and Toyota's. They will sell you literally ANYTHING and at a fair price. The guy at the counter is super fast and very helpful and will find you what you're looking for.
It's easy parking, the store is very, very clean for what they sell.  I would and I do go to them first before anyone else for our parts< /Text>

I owe big time fever to these guys specially Eran/Aron. I found a rare Honda Hybrid part at only 10% of the dealer ship price. They mailed the part to Midwest for me and packaged it really well.  very reasonable price, caring and professional service.<//text>

Came in looking for a part that no other shop had. Was in and out of there in less than 15 minutes and got a great price. Would highly recommend to anybody in need of car parts, the service along with the quality of the part were both great.< /Text>

I have ordered from over 20 part out places in the past and this is worst experience ever ordering auto parts over the phone/online. Didn't receive all parts as requested. They forgot to ship one of the parts and also lost another. Also the company overcharged me for shipping bigtime, and didn't even have a the correct size box. They literally taped 5 boxes together in order to get items to fit.</Text>

I just went and ordered a big cup of fresas con crema and upon paying I saw the cup was not creamy and had alot of dry patches. I asked the girls if they can add more cream and they said they didn't have anymore 😑 I thought ok maybe the cream could be in the middle but it wasn't.  I had to make my own cream for it to taste right. I drove far to buy these just so I can make them myself when I had strawberrys at home. Ridiculous</text>

I really like the different flavors of ice cream here. Most are mexican inspired flavors. They have chips, snacks etc. Agua frescas are really good too. One thing I don't like is how expensive a cup of agua fresca is.< /Review>

Prices were very reasonable, in fact cheaper than other spots we had gone to in the IE and LA areas. Service was extremely fast and courteous, the ice cream tasted fantastic and the frescas were refreshing. We will definitely be back and will recommend!</review><user>108957819457118518910</user>< Rate>

I had the Tamarindo Raspado. It was a bit too sweet for my taste but I prefer my raspados with more ice and less syrup. The place could use some updating too. Other than that, the gals working there were great!<//text>

Ice cream is good but everytime I go in there I'm optimistic that the staff will be friendly but unfortunately, hasn't been the case the last 5 times I've gone. They just look like they don't want to be there or deal with anyone.< /Text>

It's better to go to Baskin Robbins than this stool place, any little kid can out smart them, heck w little kid can even do a better job than them, I got strawberry with cream and they did it without gloves so i don't know if they did wash their hands or not and literally all of the strawberry was down the cup and the spoon was small as hell you couldn't even reach the bottom, we had to go home and get a bigger spoon and either way that thing was hella bad you could make it yourself and it'll be a lot more better. The ice cream?? Don't get me started, they had other type of ice cream there mixed with another, like, at least have the decency to take it out. Now the service, the service was really bad they had faces of them having a bad day and they didn't even understand what we were saying even if we were saying it in Spanish they didn't understood nothing like I being dumb come separate, but these girls really had it in them, it's like they really didn't understood Spanish and were retarded. But to end this whole essay DONT GO HERE.< /review>

This place is overpriced and overrated. I got a diablito and a nuez raspado. Diablito was passable but the nuez raspado was diluted. It was basically ice water with some walnut (nuez). I had gone to Raspados Michoacán but they didn't have the flavor my son wanted. So we decided to hit up Tocumbo. We should have just opted for a different flavor because Tocumbo didn't have the flavor we wanted either.  This will be the last time I go there.< /Text>

I went to the chula vista location and Vanessa helped me. She was super rude at all times. I understand that i went 15 mins prior to closing but thats not how you treat costumers. I really love going there but they should really train their employees better. 06/16/19< /text>

<review>It's not just the ice cream that is really good but I tried their agua fresca, "frutas" flavor. It was amazing. So fresh with the perfect amount of tiny fruit chunks. Made with milk so it had a nice creamy sweet taste. Loved it!  Other drinks and snacks to try but we'll have to come back to try them all.<//review>< user_id>

This place has just about everything. Except food like tortas. But whatever they do serve, they are not greedy nor shiesty. There used to be a deli that I and many of my friends and neighborhood people would go to on H Street called Johnny's Deli &  frutería. But because new owners are there now and completely changed the menu without telling the customers They would just let us purchase the items only to find out that it's not the same thing and we have already paid.. We now all come to this place. Besides the tortas being gone. Tocumbo ice cream Place is awesome</text>

(Translated by Google) Definitely heavy attention. I drove from that distance to that place last night. I arrived 7.48 pm and had the door closed. But the door was open. I got in and asked the seller for a milling and she tells me that since they are going to close, she turned off the machines and can only sell me corn and popsicles. I don't understand why they turn them off before if the sign says that at 8 pm until that time there should be scrapes. I clarify that they asked me not to be given away! $

(Original)
Definitivamente pesima atencion. Anoche maneje desde lejos a ese lugar. Llegue 7.48 pm y tenia elletrero de cerrado. Pero la puerta estaba abierta. Me meti y le pedi a la vendedora una fresada y me dice que como ya van a cerrar apagó las maquinas y solo me puede vender elote y paletas. No entiendo xq las apagan antes si el letrero dice q a las 8 pm hasta esa hora debe haber raspados. Aclaro pedi q me vendieran no que me regalaran!!!$</Review>

<text>Melissa was the consummate server/adviser on my "virgin" experience at Ragin Cajun! The flavors brought back memories that made the dining memorable! Each staff member complemented the evening. What a wonderful way to come out of the QUARANTINE!

< Review>
Unfortunately not what I expected spending $95. Flavors were bland.. Seasoning food doesn't have to mean salt bath, but maybe taste testing before serving would do a great deal. Po boy was decent because of its sauce, had frog and alligator that could have benefited from seasoning their batter. Thanks< /Review>

We had an excellent time and were treated so warmly despite staying up until closing time! Our drinks were strong and delicious and our food was excellent. They were out of a few items because we dined at the end of the night on a Sunday but they were more than willing to accommodate the inconvenience. The music, decor and heat lamps were a welcoming bonus as well. Merci!</text>

The food was very delicious. The drink was a tad sweet for an alcoholic beverage (my opinion only) but it was good. The restaurant was decorated for Halloween as well as the host having on a costume. The weather was great as well as the atmosphere. Our waiter was very pleasant and prompt.< /text>

Fun casual spot right on PCH in Redondo Beach with good food. Overall just a nice experience.  Food is not amazing but everything that was ordered was fresh, cooked well and satisfied each of us. The service was nice, attentive and quick. We will enjoy coming back.</review>

Solid 4 stars if your looking for some Louisiana Lightning Cajun food. The jambalaya and gumbo were insanely good and must tries. The po boy on the other hand was just average except got the bread, oh boy that was some good bread.< /Text>

< Review>
Seated quickly at an enclosed patio. Great view looking up at tall palms as whispers of clouds floated by. If you like sports, a large monitor was well placed for viewing so it's a great spot for outdoor dining in this time of COVID restrictions.
I wish the food had been better. After a loooooong wait, the crawfish gumbalaya and my alligator sausage po-boy arrived. The sausage was reminiscent of a spicy Polska Kielbasa and the roll was crisp, the sauce delicious. However, the grilled onions and peppers that were noted in the menu were missing, instead substituted with lettuce and tomato. The gumbalaya was all heat and little flavour. Our drinks? The bottle of beer was past its "best by" date and the only flavour in my Dixie Mule was that of lime- ginger beer was completely absent and I doubt there was much vodka added to that mug filled to the brim with ice. Seems like a nice place to eat, given the many people there, but unfortunately all of our choices were found to be lacking. One last thing- please fix the stall doors in the ladies bathroom! Neither has a functioning lock and one stall has at least a 3-inch gap when the door is shut.<//Review>

Place was clean and great ambiance. No music playing just tvs all over! Food was delicious 😋! You need to know the menu to order just right amount 3 plates was enough for 4ppl! All though all is a la carte, just a bit pricy.</text>

It was horrible, over priced and non flavored. Everything taste like it had flour in it even the gumbo. The potatoe salad looked like mashed potatoes and had no flavor. The overall place was just bad on top of that we had long waits to see a server. I would not recommend this place to anyone and I hope this isn't a Mardi Gras themed place. Nothing like Nawlins....if I could I would of given them ZERO stars. $209  for what!!! I want a refund< /text>

Great food. Highly  recommended. To keep it 100 as always.  The mac and cheese and fried catfish are not good. Mac and cheese had a bland taste same with the catfish. But everything else is great!!</review>

I was a little disappointed, the food was a little on the bland side. The soup was tasty though. The waiter was courteous, thus the 3 stars.</Review>

Been here a few times.  Left happy each time.  Being from Louisiana it was a surprise to see a cajun place here, even more surprised to see it's menu listing the food as being from the area I'm from.  Been working my way through the menu and haven't been disappointed in any of my choices.<//text>

<review>So me and my boyfriend ordered for New Year’s Eve 2020. Never ate here before. We spent $108 on our meals. It took 30 minutes and we were in a  hotel 5 minutes away LITERALLY by GPS. All our food was cold, like it was just sitting around. The salmon was dry. We got bread pudding instead of peach cobbler. The beignets were super cold the supposed melted chocolate that came on the side was syrup. The fried catfish were thin cuts. The only thing we liked was the red beans and rice.

Never again.<//review>< pictures>

We had frog legs to start & decided to get the chicken sandwich because two different people suggested it was one of their favorites, the food was just okay but the price made it worse. The ambiance was good, unfortunately I don't recommend this place</review>

<Text>I ordered the crab legs and was disappointed with the quantity of the meal. It said 1.5 lbs of crab, which it was not. It also has one small corn cobette and two small red potatoes that had no seasoning. For $48, I expected more.  The server asked how it was and I explained our disappointment. He came back 5-10 minutes later to tell me that he told the owners and they didn't want to do anything. I'm shocked. I would have been fine with a small discount, or maybe a dessert or at least a personal explanation. I will not be here again. Rum punch was good at least. Save your money and go to a crab in the bag place like Boiling crab.< /Text>< Pics>

This was my first time eating here and it won't be my last.
My guests and I enjoyed our food. The staff is very friendly and nice.
I had the smothered pork chops over rice with Mac and cheese. It reminded me of my Grandmother's.  It was delicious! The chicken and sausage bisque was very good.
I really enjoyed myself and for a first time visit, they did exceptional  service.
I will be back.</text>

I could've continued living my life without ever experiencing this restaurant. I was not satisfied with this experience at Ragin Cajun Cafe. My family and I went out for a goodbye dinner as a party of 6. We ordered water, drinks, and food. I wasn't impressed with the service The food is not great. The fries were good, the Mac and cheese was great. The Gumbalaya plate was flavorless but portion was huge. It taste like it came out of a can.

This was my first experience here and, unfortunately, my last.</Text>

<text>First time here enjoyed the food and the drinks was awesome. Our waiter was Tyler and he is also one of the bartenders, and man can he make a drink. Please let him make your drink you will not be disappointed. Now, I'm sure the other bartenders are good as well. The staff is friendly, the owner is very involved. The only thing is I live to far (Riverside county), but I will be back soon.</text>< pics>

I came here because of the memorial day weekend special. They have a pretty big menu. Menu prices are good in certain areas but not all. I did order the crawfish which was delicious. The server was very attentive and was making sure that we had everything we needed. The only complaint I have was that some of the crawfish weren't purged all the way. I don't know if they're supposed to purge them or if the seller they bought from was. However. I would get mud taste in my mouth and sand in some crawfish. Correct that and it should be fine.< /Review>

Disgusting burnt overpriced dry turkey we preordered. Here is a tip. Change your oil when cooking the turkeys. We have a pitch black turkey with nothing but 1 leg on it to eat everything else was not edible. Would stay far away from this place, picked the turkey up and it snapped in half. Thanks for ruining dinner. Stay away from this place.< /review>

Ritter's really is an unassuming gem in Alhambra. Coming in for lunch on Friday was great because it was not busy at all. Christmas music was playing in the background which automatically made the vibes great.</Review>

<review>The worst Cajun place I've been to in SoCal. I paid $150 to give me and my friends food poisoning. All the meat smelled and the vegan food was not cooked enough, not to mention some things came out cold. The perimeter of the outside seating and the parking lot was divided by hay with bird feathers and human hair in it.. I'd go for the drinks before anything else, I believe this place is due for inspection. This restaurant could be a great thing, but the food quality isn't there. We left our food barely eaten and ended up happier at Little Caesar's.< /review></record>

Drove by the Ragin Cajun Cafe and have to say, the sign really is what caught our eye and drove us in ... we didn't realize until after how close to closing we showed up but they were gracious enough to seat us and serve us and let us finish our meal all the while being super courteous and not mentioning that they were edging closing until we asked ... this was above and beyond customer service wise and as ignorant Travellers who didn't look at the door on the way in, this was really appreciated on our part ... we ordered the Alligator as an appetizer and it was pretty good !  Everything we ordered was fantastic and very flavourful ... the jumbo shrimp on my meal was a little dry but other than that, everything was amazing!!!< /Text>

<review>The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, is because I thought the price that I paid for my 4 piece fried chicken meal, was a bit high. I wish I could give 4.5 stars instead, cuz the chicken was DELICIOUS & the customer service was awesome!

Fine place for cajun food. Arrived at five, it wasn't busy. Next time I'll be back with my relatives. The bill was good for what you get.</review>

Went there yesterday night and all will say is that they have great decor for the theme. But the food I had was horrible. It had no flavor at all for a Louisiana "Cajin" style restaurant. The seafood I ate was done properly, The drink we had was not all to good and it was all over priced. But the staff was friendly.<//Review>

Cajun food and the atmosphere at this location is great. I wish there were more places like this around town. The service here is friendly. The bill was average for the menu.</review>

<user_name>Ken Peters</user_name><date>1605070536535< /date><rating>5</rating><review>2020.  We were staying in a hotel in Hermosa Beach near the Rajun Cajun in Redondo Beach, Ca, and we decided that Cajun food would be a great change of pace.

I spent seven years in the 1970’s in N.O. so I was familiar with the food served at Commander’s Palace, Tujaque’s, Antoine’s, Brennan’s and other fine dining venues in the Crescent City.  The Rajun Cajun represents their cuisine very well.

We ordered Jumbo Shrimp grilled with fresh vegetables and corn bread and the Etouffee Combo which came with red-beans-and-rice (one word in N.O.) with sausage which is traditional and “gumbolaya”, their take on Jambalaya.

Everything was great including the fresh vegetables which were perfectly prepared.  The three elements of the Etouffee plate were quite distinct in flavor and texture despite their similarities (all over a rice base).
The dishes invoked many fond memories of my time in New Orleans and of its very distinctive cuisine.

If you have an opportunity, visit the Ragin’ Cajun for a taste of the distinctive New Orleans cuisine then, visit one of my favorite cities, New Orleans, Louisiana.

Take-out, delivery, curbside and socially distanced outside dining are all provided by a socially aware management.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>The customer service was ok, we were seated right away and they were even able to give us a table on the side patio where we could take my sister's little dog.  Once we ordered,  it took a long time, almost an hour and half before they brought our food.  The food was tasteless and had nothing of cajun.  We ordered the four piece "cajun" chicken.  Tasteless.  We wasted out time and money.</Review>< pics>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>The food was nice i thought the mac and cheese was excellent,  the salad was beautifully  made ,the pork chops with rice and gravy needed a little help. The gravy and rice on point but the porkchop needed a little  bit more help. The coke was to die for. But what i dont understand is,  why when you ask for a coke to go, the waiter brings you a empty cup. I had all ready paid for the drink with my meal.Need to work on customer service.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Food was good and something to talk about but the real gold is in the margaritas. On tuesdays they offer $2 margaritas all day. And they do not disappoint. After 2 drinks( depending on your tolerance) you got a good buzz going. Then they bring out the delicious food. Let's say you add 2 more margaritas and you just might fall in love. They are superb and quite frankly it's a shame we all haven't been there yet. Get over there enjoy some food, enjoy some tv, enjoy some drinks, enjoy the customer care and really appreciate the jewel of a restaurant it is.</Text><user_name>bigtayy25<//user_name><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXm_k2Hu5g7NkdY11x3XcVWMEmHKCa4se0KRr_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOULhZxqubQAACJypNBYS0-Y0WprqZ86nrV-0ho=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSxYeE-GBB-iVUq28WgWlWu_Zz8MkrZENhR1fi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><rate>5< /rate></record>

Had the Crawfish Boil "TO GO"  boiled to perfection plenty of seasoning soaked through. Heads where sweet not a lot of fat but boy were they tastey! Ordering and pick up was easy and friendly.< /Review>

There are no Cajuns in the kitchen, I know this because of the taste or rather the lack of true Cajun flavors in the food</Review>

I loved the Blackened Salmon! My mother was born in Louisiana SO I know excellent southern food when I eat it. I had fried alligator for the first time with my niece and daughter, and it was delicious. The food was great. The service was fantastic.
I will go back for sure. There were a few ants, but lavender oil will keep them away. Overall, I still love the restaurant. Thank you! 💖<//Review>

Bday dinner. Dad's from New Orleans so it's great to find good N'awlins food. We had po boys, blackened cat fish, oysters, crawfish and shrimp etouffe, red beans and rice. Pretty good and lots of choices. Friendly staff and lots of parking< /review>

This is the perfect place to come on a Sunday afternoon for some good food and drinks and to watch some football. We got discounted prices on drinks and appetizers for wearing Saints ⚜️ gear and the food was really. It’s shrimp week right now so I’d love to come back and try one of those shrimp entrees. Dope restaurant!!!< /Text>

<review>Casual, friendly atmosphere. Austin, our server, was cheerful, friendly and polite. Food was hot and delicious! Pure Cajun...my go to place for this type of food. (Outside of New Orleans or Memphis) alligator was good and tender, gumbo nice and flavorful (wish they'd also put shrimp in it), etouffee was really good, and the shrimp/crab corn bisque was really delicious. We always get diff foods and split them. Highly recommend!!< /review>< date>

< Review>
Love this place.  Great food, portion sizes are well balanced and they have a great variety of creole dishes.  Took my mom for Mother's Day and she's very picky with southern food and she enjoyed it very much.  They make their own sauces that you can purchase and they are very good.  The Garlic sauce is my favorite, just a little bit of sweet, a little heat and a great balance of garlic.</Review>

<Text>Not worth your dollar.  We had high hopes but we're drastically let down. Pre frozen, over fried and under season blah food. Not cajun food at all. This is coming from a person w lousiana roots. We made garlic toast from the white bread they gave and sadly that was the high light of our meal.
We ordered the alligator,  catfish, gumbo and bisque.  Half stars for all. Very disappointed.< /Text>< Name>

Our salads came out soon after, and they were well prepared. My chicken was juicy and tasty, and the spinach was very fresh. My friend enjoyed her Skirt Steak salad as well, and it did look very good!

We definitely enjoyed our meals, and unfortunately were too stuffed for dessert. Service was great and I look forward to returning here in the future.<//Review>

Pescatarian friendly diet. The host helped me order an appropriate meal for my diet. The blackened catfish Poboy with potato salad. It was a bit too spicy to finish but the host daid it would be. Near the beach, so ate to go by the Torrance/Redondo beaches with a view while on a lunch break from Lyft driving on a Saturday afternoon. Located on PCH, parking lot tiny but not impossible to find parking in.< /text>

<Text>I usually never review but I had to tonight!! My wife ordered over 120$ worth of takeout tonight and it was horrible! We wanted to sample different things from the menu(being that I'm from Louisiana) and miss the food plus we seen there was a good star rating. 3LBs of crawfish for 64$ tiny and over cooked which made it hard to peel,flavor ok. Boudian was okay minus the fact 1 link=10$...seafood platter desert dry, bayou bisque was some type of weird put together corn chowder over white rice , one bite and it went to the trash. Red beans and rice just ok. I will never eat here again. i don't  recommend  at all.It was a waste of time and money!1 star is definitely  being nice about it.</Text><username>Darius Wilridge<//username>< pictures>

<Text>My first time going to Ragin Cajun, not what I expected.o got friend shrimp and gumbo. I generally like harder fried shrimps, covered with batter, but these were lightly battered. The gumbo was OK, my daughter like it better than another local place where we get gumbo, but it was a little spicy for me. The interior was decorated with a lot of artifacts representing New Orleans, however I don't like dimly lit rooms when I eat and I'm not one that enjoy the vintage or rustic look. The Hurricane drink was good and you got a glass with it.< /Text>< Pics>

Many say Rajun Cajun is an oddity for Redondo Beach California, but I say it is a diamond in the rough. I remember going to grand opening several years ago and being awestruck by how good the Surf and Turf was. I love just about everything they have but the Surf and Turf is my favorite plus it is a safe place to start. Over the years, they have had wonderful deals and boils that are opportunity not to be passed up. When I first looked at the drink menu when I was underage and I vowed to try the fancy drinks when I turned 21. The skull drinks are creative and taste fantastic. The Diablo is my favorite. On Easter, my parents and I got the deep fried turkey dinner plus fixings and it was the best turkey I have ever had.

Now the important part. Rajun Cajun is a family owned restaurant and like every restaurant, had been hit hard by COVID-19. The family owned restaurants are the first to close for good during times like these and I along with friends and family, would be deeply saddened if Rajun Cajun closed.

If you have never been to Rajun Cajun, now is the time and if you are a fan, please support our New Orleans away from New Orleans, Rajun Cajun.<//text>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>Ambiance 5 stars. Communication 3 stars. Food 3.5 stars. Its been years since coming back in (I've been out of state), that being said, it isn't the same. Missing was the heart and soul. Not missing was the server eating crab with her fingers (and licking them! ) in the pass through from the bar to the kitchen... in full view of patrons by the way... gross. Not missing was the bartender's snide attitude.
IF we go back... it will be during the dinner rush. Perhaps the older staff will be too busy to cop an attitude by then.  (The young man at the register was sweet, fun & polite... weird that the rest of them weren't happy to be there? )</text>< Resp>

<Review>Stumbled upon this place while looking for the Walgreen's. Staff were extremely friendly as we came through the doors and found us a table event though they were fully booked for Valentine's day. Swapped stories about Lousiana with the friendly couple seated next to us while enjoying cajun shrimp, etouffee, and beans & rice. Wasn't highly recommended by the Walgreen's staff, but I'll give it 5 stars, and we'll be back.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I finally stopped by this place after driving by many times for the past 8 years. Boy have I been missing out. The food is great here. Saw the menu. Thought it was a bit pricey. But as soon I took a bite out of my crispy chicken po boy, I was hooked. Definitely coming by next time to try other dishes.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>I ordered the brisket over white rice with gravy. The rice and gravy were delicious. The brisket on the other hand was not brisket.  They replaced the brisket with pot roast. This is a different cut of beef from two different ends of the cow with very different flavors. I was very disappointed. They should have been honest and not assume that diners dont know the difference.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Ordered the blackened catfish, terrible! Basically they covered it with blackened seasoning, and lightly seared it... Definitely could tell there was no cast iron skillet used... Drinks were watered down, beer was basically served at room temperature. Being from the South, and having lived in Louisiana, worked at Dooky Chase I know what Cajun good should look like and taste like. I'll be back during crawfish season, hopefully they don't miss the mark there... Other than that I'll never be back</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I ordered the fried turkey for Thanksgiving and when I got home and opened it, it was fried to a crisp. I immediately called them to let them know and there was no sympathy it was just being it back will give you your money back. What was I to do for Thanksgiving? So I took it back the next day and again there was no sympathy. Didn't even want to give me cash for what I paid for just a simple we will put back on your card and maybe it will be there Monday. Steve wouldn't even come out to talk to me, what a wimp! Im never coming back to this place and I advise the same!</review>

I think they forgot or order. It would have been great if our server or the manager would have approached our table more, even to apologize. We waited almost an hour before being served. Waiter blamed it on " well done" order. We had one in a party of 10.  Not cool! I'm pretty chilled but this got to me.< /review>

Update... We just ate there last night - AGAIN! And once again, super friendly staff, and HOLY SHNIKIES the RIBS... GET THE RIBS!!! Out of this world, man.. We just moved to California from the south...we've found that It is in fact true, what they say, that it is very difficult to find culturally accurate food done right at restaurants... But the Ragin Cajun Cafe totally gets it! The food was absolutely delicious, right on, and very quick... the staff was fantastic as well... Definitely take your family here... I'm Mike Leporati, artist and musician in Hollywood, Los Angeles California - and we'll be back!</text>

There were multiple things that made me decided to write a review. All 5 adults drinks were watered down, then the owner came to bring bread to our table but not enough for everyone. She then stood at the bar smiling looking at our table which obviously made us feel uncomfortable. My kid brother food had come and when I say the chicken strips were disgusting he even said it himself and he is 5.  Finally the food was coming out is what we thought but only two people plates came out. It took about 15 minutes until the remaining food came out which made our food cold.  Would I recommend friends or family 🤔 NO. The waiter was probably the reason we did not get up and leave. Mellisa Jane was great she was attentive and courteous. Besides her, my overall experience was below average I will not be returning.</Text>< pictures>

I’m shocked by these reviews!! I am from Louisiana and this is the only place I can go and find authentic Cajun food and great service! Yelp is such a joke. When people do not get a discount or get their way they are so quick to provide negative feedback! This is my favorite place to eat and while not cheap the customers need to understand they are getting authentic food and some of it travels a great distance to get to your table!!!! Keep up the great work everyone and we will continue to visit as often as possible!< /review>

The first time we went was better, but we went on New Years day 2018 and the food came warm (not hot). The stuffing inside of the "Stuffed Red Snapper" tasted questionable...and almost had a defrost taste to it. I had to send that back because I didn't trust it.

My moms catfish was also at room temperature and the potato salad was flavorless. However the fired chicken was good. The restaurant was empty so I expected the food to be piping hot and fresh. It was not.

Lastly the bignets tasted like fried tortillas sprinkled in an abundance of powder sugar...I couldn't believe they even brought that to the table.

Nice New Orleans atmosphere, but disappointed in the temperature and quality of the food.</review>

One of my All Time Favorite places to eat ever and i dont live in the area.

Service is friendly and you get free beniets when you check in.
Drinks are really fun and come in mason jars.

Food is really really good and very flavorful:
Appetizer: Alligator for the win
Gumbolaya- is thee bomb.
Vegan Gumbo THE VEGAN BOMB!
Ribeye  or Catfish is great too.

Great for groups, been here with groups dozens of times.

Parking is plentiful and you will leave Plenty FULL!!!</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I've been coming to Ragin' Cajun since I found out they opened this location.
I've never "reviewed" it before tho & I need to rectify that.

It is AWESOME!!
I'm a Jambalaya, Gumbo, Crawfish nut.

Ever since my years living in Baton Rouge [family is still there] good Cajun cuisine has been what I crave.
When I need something to remind me of "home" there's no other place for me.

I don't mind the wait when it's crowded, I love the bands when there's one playing, I dig the "MOONSHINE" & BEST of all, they have ABITA "TURBO DOG"!!

Yes. When it's my birthday, everyone knows where I want to go.

My friend said red beans and rice was good. Gumbalaya- rice was hard, and looked like shredded chicken on top of rice. Coleslaw horrible. They had $2 maragaritas. Now when I left my stomach was hurting I thought maybe I was abnormally full because I really just test taste everything. The next morning my stomach ached all day had the runs too. Called all my other friends and they too had been feeling ill running back and forth to toilet. Its day 2 after eating there and I'm still woman down going to Dr. Today.  I dont know if it was food or $2 drinks whatever the case it came from this restaurant. Never going back. Only thing I tasted that was good was icecream and beneit, that's it. That's the only thing I ate all off. Calamari-No, Fried pickles-No, fried oysters-No, blackened shrimp-No.< /review>< pictures>

<review>I ordered the Cajun catfish and it had a tainted like old after taste like it had been in the freezer to long. One small piece of catfishwas over saturated with a Cajun spice to drown the taste of The fish itself.

The beans and rice were plain and the potato salad was the better of the meal.

For $22.00 I would have had a better meal at Del Taco's..<//review>< Pictures>

<review>This place had been on my list for a while, but I was so disappointed when I finally ate here. The food was SO bland and the flavors were repetitive! When I wrote a subpar review on Yelp, the owner of this place wrote a condescending response saying that they served “traditional” Cajun food and that I wouldn’t know.

Multiple of my friends have been to/are from New Orleans and they told me not to come here because the food sucked. I’ve also been to say better Creole and Cajun places that actually seasoned their shrimp etoufees and blackened catfish.

Management should be ashamed.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Horrid. Unfortunately  I had a perfect view of the kitchen and had to painfully watch the Mexican "Cajun" cooks eating my food while cooking my food. Total turn off. Food was no buenoriffico, barely should call it Cajun. Maybe change it to a Mexican seafood place? Good luck. Don't waste your $.<//Text>< Pics>

My boyfriend and I bring our amstaff pup here and get the warmest welcome every time. The oysters are better than anything offered in the south bay- akin to the oysters served at some of the best places in new Orleans! Burgers and wings are great. We love coming here to relax on their patio!</Review>

The food was horrible. The Cajun fried chicken was greasy and had no Cajun flavor to it, the white rice tasted like Minute Rice, and the broccoli, cauliflower and green bean veggie trio tasted like it had been cooked in rancid oils and had an "off" flavor. Their prices were inflated, and the service was dismissive. Told them it was my mother's birthday and for that she was supposed to get a birthday baguette, and they ignored the request. Didn't even sing her happy birthday. Spoke to the manager Danielle, and all she said was “I'm sorry to hear that". Did not offer to make any restitution. Good luck to you with that kind of service. Unbelievable.<//text>

The food is very good. The service is definitely not, especially the bartender. You're not doing me a favor by serving me. We are doing you the favor by choosing your establishment over the many, many choices we have. A little kindness towards your guests goes along way. Will order my food "to-go" going forward.</text>

Really good non-commercial tasting food it tastes like food that your grandmother would make. You'll definitely be full and get to bring home food for the next day. The customer service is really good  our waiter was really cool and observant.</review>

I honestly did not like this place at all. My gf invited me and she said it was good but I did not enjoy my meal at all. The customer service was really good. But maybe it’s just a preference as to what I want to eat.< /review>

< Review>
We have gone here a few times for lunch, usually groups of 4 or 5. The food is mediocre, but its a cool atmosphere. Our last visit was rather disappointing. when it came down to the bill, I noticed it had a gratuity already included. I caught it prior to leaving cash with the receipt. As we were driving back to work, coworkers were complaining how expensive the prices had risen since last visit. I noted to them the tip was already included (on our group of 4!!) they were furious. Not only did they include the tip to the bill, it was at the 22% mark. Some of the group left additional cash not reading the invoice. It felt like we were robbed by the waitress. I'm aware that gratuity is usually included with large groups, we were a group of 4. For those that left cash tip,,.. they should have read the itemized receipt. But I think this is a poor practice and is unacceptable. We will not be back. The prices have been rising past the food quality as it was. This was enough to take it off the company lunch rotation.< /Review>

This place is trash and so is the food. The owner is a belittling racist that takes it personal when you criticize the food and awful drinks.. I wouldn't waste my money on this dump unless you just like throwing money away.. It's baffling how the doors are still open... Do Not Eat Here... The Cleanliness of this place is awful. They served my drink in a dirty cracked glass..< /text>

This Ragin Cajun has a fun, laid back vibe. They have a large selection of whiskey and fairly decent beers on tap. Service is a bit slow, but friendly. If you want a taste of the south, try the corn bread or the crab cakes. You won't be disappointed!<//Text>

Seafood Bisque was nothing more than corn chowder with shrimp, shells and crab. Flavorless with much more to be desired. Pecan pie tasted days old. This was my 3rd attempt, I won't be back.</Text>

<Text>Terrible first trip. Would never and will never come back. Families that came in the same time we did got seated and were served there food before our order was taken. Food was mediocre at best. Waitress was a complete airhead. She could not describe the food or its portion size. Food is WAY over priced for the quality. Will not recommend anyone to this restaurant ever. If I could put zero stars I would.<//Text><Resp>None</Resp><user_id>112224122818965330338< /user_id>< user_name>

But wait, there's more!!! Yessireee Bob's your uncle. Let's talk about sex.... Oops. Y'all ain't ready fo dat just yet. Cuisine of the cafe that is replicating flavours from the Bayou state. I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw and only mildly bummed by what I actually devoured.(Give that some thought.) I had the happy hour small plate of wings & frog legs. Both flavorful to be sure yet, didn't pack that ragin tangy punch that is synonymous with the bayou.
While sitting at the bar I noticed one of the stars of this cafe Melissa. This woman had me under the impression that she owned the joint. Smooth, efficient, courteous,personable and inviting. I am in the hospitality industry and this chic is a diamond. Take a date, take friends and/or roll solo either way a good time shall be had.<//review><UserId.>110953062518959064531</UserId.>< Gmap_id>

I was not impressed.  The shrimp is peel-n-eat,  that's too much work. Fried pickles were decent. Chicken strips were just average.   The rum punch tasted like a sweet drink without alcohol,  I ordered an extra shot. Chanced are I will not return.</text>

We come here often because of the service, atmosphere, and food. My son usually gets the Bayou Bisque and I get the fried catfish dinner. I really like their crawfish ettoufee (spelling?) and their servings are BIG!  If you want extra flavor, there are plenty of sauces you can add yourself. It's also a great place to watch sports. They have TV's throughout and they're not all in the same channel. The owner is also frequently there and greets everyone with a smile. She and her team make everyone feel very welcomed. Ragin Cajun is a must for anyone in the South Bay.< /review>

<Text>Horrible service from the get go. The waiter set up the highchair holder for my child's carseat and my child started falling out of it. Luckily my wife and I caught him. Then my wife ordered the chicken and sausage fettuccine and it literally tasted like fish or bad. I cant tell you which one, but it was told to the waiter and he tried to say my wife ate half of it which wasnt the case. He was totally rude about the situation. I wont be coming back.< /Text><Time>1537664801911<//Time>< rate>

There aren't many Cajun places in Southern California, but the Ragin Cajun was pretty good! I ordered the $14 lunch special with a shrimp po-boy and gumbalaya (jambalaya topped with gumbo). The food here won't hold a candle up to what you can find in Lafayette, but it will definitely satisfy your Cajun cravings. The service was great too!</text>

We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for a bite to eat. The food was just ok, but we were pleasantly surprised to find bottomless mimosas and a super friendly bartender who gave us trivia questions to talk about and engaged us in great conversation!<//text>

Awful, awful place. They used to be better at their previous restaurants but their service and food has gone down in quality. Everybody working there seems unhappy and takes it out on their customers. It's a shame cause I love cajun food and it can be pretty hard to get in LA. Driving by everyday and seeing their empty parking lot it seems their days are numbered. Let's hope the next place will serve the community better.< /Text>

First time around had a fish taco lunch and thought the place was great. Brought family for dinner and unfortunately the cajun food was very average -  don't know if it was an 'off' day for the kitchen but everything was very bland. Service was decent, no complaints.</review>

I left a review on Yelp and the owner left me back a VERY nasty reply saying it was "false information" and how we were "rude and belligerent". Half of our food was cold.  It took "42 minutes" (per the owner) for us to get our food. People that got there after us got their food before us and we were there an hour and fifteen minutes from the time we sat down until we got our food.  Evidently it took almost a half an hour for her to take our order and there was no stalling on our part for that; we knew what we wanted as soon as she came to the table. We gave our order right away.  We ordered fish and chips; the fish was soggy and soaked with oil (it was hot) and then we ordered a bowl of jambalaya which was cold and beef brisket which was cold and that took "42 minutes" to come to us. We never got any drink refills. She came to the table a few times to let us know that they were still working on it and it was going to be "5 more minutes" and after about 20 to 25 minutes she offered us bread which was cold (and not delicious). We were obviously hungry and frustrated. We told her there were people that had gotten there after us and gotten their food before us and she pointed to the table next to us asking if we were talking about them which we weren't, it was people after them. She proceeded to argue with my husband  and he told her "I'm not looking for an argument, I'm just looking for some food" so I guess that's "aggressive". When we finally said something about how it had taken so long to the waiter who was following up on us after we had gotten our food (because evidently we had been so rude and aggressive to the waitress?) he said he would send the manager over.  We were right next to the computers; I saw the guy who I figured was the manager going over our ticket with that server and then about 5 minutes later he comes to our table and asks if we wanted a drink refill. Seriously?!?! He should have introduced himself and apologized for the long wait or something professional but no, he just asked if we needed a drink refill,  didn't introduce himself as a manager or the owner or anything. So we proceeded to tell him our issues and he said well I'm the owner. My father-in-law who's been going to this restaurant for years knows the actual owner of the original restaurant was surprised and said what about Steve the owner of the original restaurant and this guy says well I'm Steve but I own this restaurant now and that guy has nothing to do with this restaurant and from right then I knew he was going to have an attitude, evidently this is a sore spot for him. So he proceeded to finally tell us that he would comp the meal and never came back to the table. We sat there for about 5 more minutes and finally decided to just get up and leave.  Very disheartening to have a place that you've been going to for years treat you that way. And, in his Yelp reply he said that we were aggressive to the waitress that we were rude and belligerent and we're not welcome back at his restaurant. Ridiculous! Trust me we will never go back to that restaurant, ever.<//Text>

< review>
The worst waiter ever works at this place.....So I went to this place for a birthday dinner. The birthday girl wanted to try  something different  since it was Dine LA week.The manager was really nice and very welcoming. However,our waiter for that night was not! For example, when we told him about water on the floor he brought us a towel and preceded to tell us "This was above his pay grade to clean the floor".He provided our guests the towel to clean the floor. He took our drink orders and disappeared to huddle in the kitchen. After about 15 mins he came back took our oders by then you can tell he was very irritated and did not want to be there, every question we asked about the menu item the more irritated and unprofessional he became.  They brought out two shareable appetizers but no additional plates. One appetizer was wings, we asked our waiter and the nice lady who refills the drinks for buffalo sauce,needless to say it took almost 30 mins for the sauce to arrive. Times passes by and some people  in our party start receiving entrees and appetizers or just entrees; when we inform the irritated waiter what was happening.he gave us a long spill about he has been working since noon and now it's seven something and he wants to go home..... Thank God for the manager; she helped majority of the party receive the missing  appetizers and entrees and brought out some bread as we waited. Now mind you we sat down about 6:00pm. After that our waiter disappeared again in the kitchen, no let me check on you to see how everything was or can I refill your drink no nothing.....He was ghost. But he did come to bring the check and this time his attitude change he was some what happy. After we paid we ask him if he could take our group picture...He said no he was off and left unfortunately I do not have a name...The manager was nice enough to take our group picture. I feel we came there to celebrate a birthday and enjoy the food.I feel if you are not caught out to be in the servicing business don't  because you are ruining it for everyone the customers and the business you work for.Granted the food was good but the  service was horrible so I will not be going back to this place.< /review>

Their food is delicious. It has a little kick but not much. The people are very traditional in greeting like in the south and you get the vibe all around the place.< /Text>

Nicely themed Restaurant / Bar...but as for the food..... the quality and lack of flavor was very disappointing. We were all excited to find this gem in Redondo but they really do not offer that Cajun spice and flare they promise....Sorry Ragin' Cajun we were not impressed and sadly will not be back.....and we LOVE Cajun food, you need to kick it up a lot to win us over.<//Review>

What a great birthday brunch!
I live in Central California and visit Ragin Cajun Cafe everytime I'm in the area since being introduced to this great place by my sister and brother-in-law. This past Sunday I celebrated my birthday, here, along with my entire family. It wasn't hard to convince everyone considering that the ladies in my group love the bottomless mimosas and all us guys like those abita beers.
If great food, awesome beers, and well prepared cocktails is your thing then make Ragin Cajun Cafe your next stop. If you've never had cajun cooking or it's been a while then ask to be seated at Nick's or Melissa's section. Nick will explain why you should try alligator meat and/or frogs legs in such a way that it's crazy not to order both. Melissa has such a southern hospitality that if you happen to like the skull glass where The Reaper is served in, a brand new one in a box will find it's way to your table along with a round of moonshine shots for everyone. The alligator is great the frog's legs are tender and savoury but the Stuffed Snapper, Surf and Turf, and Jambalaya are to die for. But no matter what you order as your main dish always make sure to ask Nick or Melissa what abita beer goes best with your meal.
Remember if you're near the Redondo Beach Pier don't bother wasting your money in their fast food places, take the 3 minute drive to the Ragin Cajun Cafe and enjoy the rest of your night.<//Review>

One of the more accurate Cajun food places here in SoCal. You can’t beat the food, a little pricey but totally worth it!<//Text>

<Review>12/29/2018 . Guess what, yep had burger again. Trying to stay away from Carbs so had coleslaw with it, it really was good for plain coleslaw. WOW, almost got my picture with review,  well I did take the photo of my wife and friends. Update again: 11/27/2018. I have to tell you they have a fantastic Hamburger, It Rocks. I guess they decided that they needed something for the non Cajun food eaters. Me and the wife sometimes are just looking for a great burger, who thought it would be here. High quality meat and bun, WOW. I was addicted to the Shrimp Po Boy before and Cajun Chicken and Sausage Chowder. I have to admit I still am crazy about that.  I have to tell you the Brisket looked really good. Someone next to me had that and they said it was wonderful. I have to admit I've been there a couple of times before but didn't write about it. Went to the Blues Festival they had and it was fun. Look for the Crayfish Festival in April.

UPDATE:  7/29/2018. Had the steak tonight, man was that good and potato salad. Wife can't stop ordering the bisque. Finally ordered something different, then the blacken shrimp Po Boy, wasn't cheap, but steak was first class, ate everything except the plate.   Been back a number of times for Lunch, but like to update every once in a while.   UPDATE: 12/19/2017   This time I went with my wife and friend. I was sitting next to a couple and asked them about their meal. I told him I am confused about the reviews I've read. They stated that they are  from Louisiana and they tried to explain that people who aren't from Louisiana and are from California just don't understand the food correctly and that this is the only restaurant they come across out here that tastes exactly and the closest to the food they grew up with. He explained that he knows the  the restaurants history and has a choice,  but the choice he makes is to be at this restaurant and I said thank you.  Please read through the reviews and decided what's  real.   Having friends bash a restaurant to promote your restaurant is not the right Forum for food reviews.   Seriously I don't see this happening to other restaurants.                                       Update 6/10/2017- I can't believe the reviews with one star and calling the Chief a Mexican and not enough bread and I like the Old Place better and watered down drinks.  The Chief is the same Cook from the old place. Only difference is the old owner and his family seem to have a beef going on.. All of a sudden hateful reviews showing up. I understand sometimes longer waits, cold food, not spicy enough or too spicy reviews. Sadly these review sites can now serve as bases of hurting others.
I would read through the reviews and make your own decision on what is real. When I went there last week, the guy sitting at the bar next to me said this is the closes to the food his Mother made and when he comes out here this is where he eats all week.  * By the way my new favorite is the Shrimp Po Boy*

So far everything I've had there is great. The Bartenders are all nice and the service staff is fun. Not sure what one other person was talking about as far as un-happy workers, I thought all workers are happy. I love the Blacken Steak and  Shrimp Fettuccine, my wife likes it with chicken and sausage. I've been there about 10 times with different groups of people. For my: I eat like a five year old friends,  They can make the food not spicy and they do have vegetarian options, just ask. Try to go there when they have the shrimp and crayfish boils going on. The new owners Steve and Lisa are great people and they try their hardest to insure everything is done right. All I can say is everyone that I know loves the food. By the way the Bartenders shake my hand and welcome us when we show up.<//Review><user>116786545666977694677</user>< response>

Alligator is excellent. Tase is good. Bisque could be less rice. But great place.</Text>

<gmap_id>0x80c2b4ae96de5913:0xe7b9cf1bc64012b0<//gmap_id><Text>So damn it. Pretty cool not going to lie now the worst Jack and Coke no joke is actually the worst Jack and Coke it's something about either not the right proportion of the poor cuz it either has that weird coke water down taste that does not taste good especially in a full drink that's usually in the bottom last sip of the drink but all in all food tastes good nothing extremely special but nice to be able to find a place that has a variety of different food like frogs legs or alligator meat. Today it's been a long time since I've seen a shrimp po boy on the menu other than Joe's Crab Shack but I decided to go for it. I needed a po-boy in my life. Now receiving my sandwich I didn't get a lunch special or anyting but instead of a full sandwich I happen to get a cut in half that get it seemed which then slice down the middle for the filling and it happened to be this weird triangle that didn't fit any of the shrimp in it. The Remoulade sauce seemed to be almost non existent unfortunatly and the cajun fries that I ordered I happen to have a horrible request and I know Cooks hate me but I like my fries beyond crispy (they tried very well to accommodate) but np matter what the thickness of them it was almost impossible in the time frame to have them as crispy as chips. Now as for the wings which I am a very big Wing connoisseur and I must say they have some beautiful ....beautiful! The iced tea seems to be brewed fresh and it was extremely tasty without the sugar and nothing added just the way that he should be the way it comes for its flavor and robust Taste of herbs. Also I must say they have a beautiful selection desserts they have a peach cobbler and even more so of course the New Orleans traditional beignets which are all ways to die for just don't breathe in on the powder sugar. All in all I like the food but I don't like the proportion a food that you receive for so much money. I've worked in plenty of restaurants to know what the overhead is. Stock in their Seafood has got to be of course high and they told must try to be making it up by smaller proportions of certain items like bread and even french fries. As much as I love that they give you more meat shouldn't skip on what comes with especially as cheap as it may be. Now and any restaurant you'll know that most of the money is made up of drinks preferably soda fountain refillable drinks that is where most money is made in the restaurant industry. They are very sweet because upon my departure I asked if I could have my iced tea to go and as a good server she actually got me a fresh one instead since I paid $3 for an iced tea when it is free refill. But may I add she did almost take my glass to look me in the eye and hopefully realizing that I'm explaining with my gestures wow are you really going to pour my small two to three sips of iced tea in a cup and send me on my way? Now I happen to be a Frugal person which means I would have probably not wasted it anyways I've never had anyone take my cup like that. I suggest if eating here don't be too extremely hungry for what you think you may be paying for unless you plan on buying a dinner plate cuz of Sandwich comes half weight size and the french fries are a small red robin size without the free refills. Now they have a lovely selection of moonshine and beer do try and stop in for such if you like but don't expect too much from a normal Jack and Coke then and of course your portions on food ,cool atmosphere though must say</Text><time>1519006221804<//time></record></dataset><record>

Not the same since the original owner, Steve isn't there. The gator was tough and chewy. The cooks gave us the wrong food order and recycled part of the order onto a new plate with the Crawfish 1/2 & 1/2, and it had sausage in it from the cooks scraping the plate. To top it off, it was cold...REALLY!!!!
My husband & I have been going to Rajun Cajum off Pier Ave, when Steve would give samples while you waited outside. That was 23yrs ago, when I was pregnant with my first son. We now have two sons and it used to be great!! Sorry to say, It is not the same now, We did have a great waiter, Massoud it you want good service!!</Text>

<time>1506017439581< /time><rating>1<//rating><Text>9-17-2017. HEAVEN! HEAVEN! HEAVEN! DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN! Had dinner last night at the NEW LOCATION in Hermosa Beach. It is across the street from the ORIGINAL location on Peir Ave. As I walked through the door a big smile and hello from Jeanie. The place was pretty full but there was a single table open so I sat down and the server was there right away with a big smile asking for a drink order and a menu. The restaurant had the same vibe as the old place across the street. Steve came by and had that great hello and I could tell he was happy to see how things were going. Lot's of happy people enjoying a great dinner and the food and service was as great as ever! Had the Jambolaya/Gumbolaya combo, the wonderful sourdough bread and pecan pie. Mmmmmmmm! From all the folks eating there and working there it was easy to tell everyone was enjoying the night! So I guess the only thing else to say is, HALLELUJAH THE ORIGINAL IS BACK! See you next week!

THIS IS FOR THE REDONDO BEACH LOCATION ONLY. I have been wanting to write this for awhile. I have been a Ragin Cajun customer since 1998. I use to eat there almost every Thursday after our managers meeting for 10 years. Steve, Jeanie and the rest always made me feel like I was part of the family over for lunch. My favorites were the jambalaya gumbolaya combo, pork chops in brown gravy and cajun chicken salad. Even got to meet Steve & Jeanie's mom when she came out to see the Price is Right! That conversation turned into mom sending her homemade pralines out so we could have them for desert even if we had the praline sauce cheesecake or pecan pie. After the original closed I got my fix of the combo on the trucks. I was happy to see #2 open on PCH. That however has changed over the last 2 years. Last time in about a month a go because I had a craving for the pork chops (combo & cheesecake cravings I got from the truck). The pork chops were dry and tough (had to use a knife!), the service slow and not good, had 2 different drinks brought to my table I did not order! Maybe the worst was no sourdough bread (a staple with Steve) but instead some godawful dry bacon cornbread. With the prices twice what they use to be, service not half as good and food not nearly as good it is no wonder the place was half empty from the old one in Hermosa on Pier Ave. I understand from the truck guys Steve no longer has anything to do with the restaurant just the trucks now. It shows.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

This is my favorite New Orleans food styled restaurant.
It's a very cozy laid back southern style home cooked meal kinda place.
It has Louisana decor and their famous jazzy blues like funk music playing in the background. It has a full sized bar, plenty of seats, booths, high top tables, great ambiance and simply delicious comfort food.
It also has my all- time must have and favorite- good ole' southern yummy SWEET TEA!!! I just can't get enough!  So Deeee-licious!!!😋
My favorite starters are the popcorn shrimp and the garden salad and their  homemade French salad dressing.
It's really great!!!
My usual entrees are the  Gumbalaya combo, Gumbalaya, Chicken & Sausage gumbo, Red beans & rice w/ sausage. It comes without sausage for the Vegans. They also have a Veggie Vegan Gumbo which is really good too.
I just love this place!!
Anything you order, and they do have quite the assortment of choices will be absolutely fantastic!
You will not be disappointed.
They also have daily and seasonal specials on unique foods of Na'orlins like-Crawfish. Oh yeah, they have BEIGNETS!! If you have or have not been to Na'lins- these are famous!!
Soooooo gooood!!!
The owners are husband and wife. If you go as often as I do you get to see them alot. They say hello and make you feel at home, literally.
I eat here like 2-3 times a week
and love my leftovers!
They also have Happy Hour food and drinks. They serve a BOTTOMLESS (unlimited) Bloody Mary(my favorite) and Mismosa for $16.
Uhhh, just come eat for yourself!!
Enjoy! Can you tell I do?💟⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</review>

2 stars because 1. The service was horrible 2. Business was operating inefficiently 3. Food was either average or below. With a party of 20+ during happy hours, the waiter probably showing off her mental ability because she wasn't write down our orders. At the end she forgot a few orders. The restaurant was 1/3 full but it took 45min-1hr to get food. The waiter forget orders and blame on kitchen staff. Business was operating inefficiently where buser carrying out food and yell out the entrée rather than going directly to individual. The atmosphere doesn't feel welcoming or personal. Therefore food were coming out separately rather than all together. It's understandable for big party, but other 4 seater tables foods were coming out separately. Water took 30 minutes to refill or even notice. Took 15mins to split the bill because the waiter doesn't have organized system in place, was going around asking each individual what they had. The food was saltier than average Cajun places. No amount of dipping, sauce, or dilution can fix that salty-ness in the food<//text>

Good food but the service was awful.  Did refill water, bring requested condiments, bring out the bread- even after asking if we wanted it, then couldn't find the dessert we had brought for the Bday celebration.</Text>

This was my favorite place when they were in Hermosa years ago. The gumolaya is my favorite, although lately it seems to be lacking a little in the meat and portions area(just a touch) They have a new spacious location. It's a new staff and not everything is up to par. I like to buy their brand of hot sauces, which were $6. They had one flavor on display for $8. I asked if the smaller garlic bottle was still $6. He said he didn't know and instead of checking told me to come back when, "they will have more for sale." I will def come back, but might have to alter my review if they continue to disappoint. If they become anything like the old hermosa joint, it will be five stars.  the food truck was always great too, so for now I'll cut them som slack<//Review>

If your looking to have great authentic Cajun food that tastes like it's straight from the bayou then you've found it. As a Louisiana local that moved here i'd been searching for good cajun food that tasted as good as it did back home.

This was not as easy as i thought it would be, especially given the diversity of different foods and cultures we have in Cali. And after repeated disappointments with the fake cajun restaurants here i finally found this gem.

I've been coming here and seeing the owner stephen since they had their original location in hermosa beach years ago. If your going to come down and sample some of this delicious food do yourself a favor and try the Bisque with Hush Puppies in it. And for those of you who like a drink or two this new location has a Moon Shine bar as well :-)<//Text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) My friend and I thought this would be a genuine cajun restaurant with fresh ingredients. Unfortunately not.

Factory-made sauces and frozen meat for the whole penny.

However, a very nice staff.

(Original)
Jag och min vän trodde att detta skulle vara en genuin cajun restaurant med färska råvaror. Tyvärr inte.

Fabriksgjorda såser och fryst kött för hela slanten.

Däremot en mycket trevlig personal.<//Text>< Pictures>
