<text>Nails always come out great! Only issue is having to be told “can you come by in an hour or 2” or “Can you come back tomorrow” which is kind of annoying because I’m a mother so it’s hard to find a sitter while I head out to their salon to try to get my nails done. Other then that they do a great job on my nails.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

They are okay. Sometimes it gets too busy and it can take over an hour to be seated but once they start on you they are pretty fast and nails come out looking good. Ive notice that they never require you to wash your hands and some of their sanitation procedures dont get followed.<//text>

<text>This time I was very satisfied
Fast ,clean service .the guy that did my nails took his time and did my nails exactly the way u wanted, as to last time I paid total of 55 for nails that popped off within a week had to go back then more popped off the next week .
They didn't even offer me a discount for the inconvenience of having to come back and nails not staying on
But other than that service was good .I've been going to NT nails for over 8yrs</text><Time>1614367418552<//Time>< resp>

<Review>Went in for a fill and trim. Nope! My nails looked worse coming out than when I went in. They wanted 40 to soak off their nail tech mistake and fix it. Bull! And while we arw on the buisness lets talk cleanliness.  A squshed roach on the floor? Really classy</Review>< userid>

The lady who did my nails didn't do a good job . Her name was Jackie . Only a few people do good nails. When I asked her to fix she had two other people come look at my nails ! Why couldn't she just fix them why make a big deal about it ? 🙄 Also I was there drying my nails for an hour and the would not dry because she put so much nail polish . (I even had one of my nails smudged because they said it was ok to leave they where dry enough ). And my nails where not evenly filed Down so they are clumpy . If you go here make sure you know who does good nail other wise they will send you to just anyone and they may not may not do a good job< /review>

Didn't give a 5* cause some of the staff makes you feel like you like they are rushing you out the door, some staff doesn't even talk to you, then some of them get upset when you ask for another coat of polish, completely cover your nail, shorten nails, etc. Plus the young lady that "assigns seating" seems very overwhelmed & tends to tell me I need to pull cash out of the atm to pay...< /Text>< time>

<Text>I’ve been a patron of NT Nails for about a year now.  I changed over to them because I was allergic to the acrylic product used by my last nail salon..I thought it was their product I was allergic to come to find out I am allergic to all acrylic products.  The employees that would work on my hands suggested I try their dipping powder with gel... OMGOODNESS what a difference that made...my hands do not hurt any more my fingers do not blister up either nor are they bright red and they do not look like I burnt them.  I love that I do not have to have tips and acrylic any more I have my own nails and the dipping powder and gel makes my own nails stronger.< /Text><gmapID>0x80eab800a9862e9f:0x91128da16a488fdf</gmapID></record>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Many visits to NT Nails over the last five to eight years, mostly pedicure and manicures. In the past, I had gotten sets of acrylic nails, but since I have had Gel Nails, then that's what I choose. Most of the time, the nail service was excellent, and maybe only 2-3 times the technique and quality was poor. Usually, hardly any wait time. I try to go in the morning, before they get very busy.  Only one time I was told  I had a 15 minute wait, then 20-25 minutes later, I was told I had 15-20 wait AGAIN.  I left only to come back another day, in the morning. Based on what I stated about the numerous services, then maybe I should say five stars.  Therefore, I changed up from four stars. By the way, everyone working there has always be nice!< /Text>< Pics>

I am here at the salon getting polish on my fingernails and toe nails. My tech is doing an excellent job and is very attentive, but that’s not why I am writing this review. I witnessed a disabled patron come into this salon and the staff was amazing. 3 staff members paused what they were doing to help this patron to their seat. They were all very attentative and seemed to make the patron feel happy and comfortable. Way to go!! I’ll come back for sure.<//Review>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>I have been coming to NT nails since they were OP nails on gingers corner, today I am extremely disappointed in the service I received! My pedicure was horrible, I am 8 months pregnant and would have liked a better massage or even have my feet soak longer, the guy that did it rushed through didn’t offer me any package I had to repeat myself multiple times! Nick and Tammy have always been amazing to me and my family but I feel like the past couple of times I have come here some of the staff are not doing their job and hate it!

If I could I would give 0 reviews. I went in for GEL nails on my NATURAL nails and somehow came out with an infection that required medical attention. Ladies please go somewhere else & save yourself the pain.<//review>

It was so busy I was about to walk out and go back another day, but she greeted me and welcomed me in. She told me to sit right away and I was there for no more than 45 minutes. Got gel polish, was very happy with the outcome. The only bad part was that the nail tech that was doing my nails kept taking deep breaths like he was frustrated, looking around at everyone walking in, and he just looked super miserable. It made me feel unwelcome, and uncomfortable. Over all it was a okay/good experience.</text><resp>None< /resp></record>

I got the old man, and he is a nice man. But his work on my nails was horrible. He tried charging me for gel nails when I only got regular nail polish. He mad me bleed twice and continued to work. And he did not shape then as I wanted, I wanted stiletto nails (I even showed him a picture as an example). But he made them almond shaped. I will not be giving them my business again.<//text>

MY DOG WAS KILLED HERE. My family and I boarded our two dogs in hopes that they’d be in a safe place for a weekend away. I showed up to find my little yorkie was killed by a dog double her size.. We received no calls phone calls about the incident. I had to find out when I walked in to take them home. Later found out she was killed the morning before due to negligence. Think, how can a 25lb dog be contained with other pups who are 10lbs or less let alone not having anyone on site to stop the fighting. They reported on video camera that they were playing, yet there’s an obvious difference between the two. We were also told mixed up stories from the staff. One was that it looked like they were playing on the video camera, the next time they said there were no footage due to that play area having a blind spot.. I asked to see our dog and was told they didn’t know where the body was.. yet was also told the staff put ice on her deceased body the previous night. They were preventing us from seeing those conditions!
While all this was happening we could not get ahold of the owner, let alone he never ever contacted us during this whole situation nor to follow up afterwards.
We were allowed to see our little London until later that night when we called in a cremation company to come pick up her body. The owner was finally at the facility and before talking to us, he was asking the worker how to make her body look presentable.. Obviously the owner does not know how to run a professional business let alone doggy care!
We found our poor little London in a storage box stuffed with blankets and ice strewn and melting over her dead body. Not even the decency to put ice bags to keep her body dry..
Talking to the owner all we felt was lack of compassion, lack of responsibility, and lack of care for this nightmare we were enduring.
Not to mention we still haven’t been reimbursed for their stay and a future one we’ve booked for Christmas. No phone calls received. We’ve been nothing but ignored and left with no compassion for a family member we so tragically lost.
A terrible way to lose an animal. She did not deserve to go this way.. being locked God knows where without us even knowing.
DON’T LET WHAT HAPPENED TO US HAPPEN TO YOU.
If you love your pups please please don’t bring them here. Also for discretion, please read the other reviews. We have found other incidents and another on google reviews that someone else’s pup was killed too!</Text>

MY DOG WAS KILLED HERE.  I purposely put that in caps to warn all other dog owners from bringing their dogs here.  We left our baby Charlie with Rick and his crew and over Memorial Day Weekend not knowing that it would be the last time we would see her alive.  One day into our vacation, we got a text message from one of the staff members telling us to call them back.  When we called back, they informed us that Charlie was killed by another dog.  Our 5lb toy poodle was killed by a 50+ lb greyhound mix that jumped over a divider into the small dog area which the staff did nothing about.  What is most upsetting is that her death could have been prevented.  Video footage showed that the large dog was in the small dog area for an extended period of time (40 minutes) and the staff did nothing to have the large dog removed.  First off, the divider should be higher so that larger dogs can not even hop over to the small dog area.  Second, it was completely irresponsible for the staff do nothing about the big dog until it was too late.  The way Rick handled the situation after our dog was killed was even more disgusting.  When we went in to go over what had happened, Rick expressed no remorse.  All he cared about was was himself and his business.  He refused to accept any responsibility for the situation and had the nerve to tell me and my fiance that “dogs are considered property in the state of California and we are not in a position to sue” even though we were there to just figure out exactly what happened to our dog.  Our dog was our baby and thanks to K9 Sanders, we will never get to see her again.  Rick and his staff at K9 Sanders failed us and our dog Charlie.  They should not be able to continue running a business with their gross negligence and unprofessionalism.  We hope that no dog owner ever has to experience the grief and pain me and my fiance have been through with the death of our dog Charlie.<//text>

<review>SCARY. Checked out when looking for a sitter for just a couple hrs & wld never leave my tiny fur baby here. Check PD's sites as mentioned in other reviews & hope the ownerS whos dogs were killed here get legal representation. As well, I believe most of the positive reviews I checked were fake. It was the only review that they had written in most cases, ect.</review><gmap_id>0x80dd2a078a3c1c55:0x6201e0658ccc40f0<//gmap_id></record>

He was also the guy that was there when I picked our puppy up and he didn't even charge me.  I have no doubt our puppy was well loved.  30 minutes into our 12 hour drive home and she's asleep.  I think she had a great afternoon!!  Thank you Sanders K9 for loving our puppy so well!!<//text>< pictures>

I love this place. I take my dogs here every time I go out of town. They never freak out when I leave them here and are always happy, healthy and clean when I pick them up. Highly recommend. Great staff, always helpful and friendly.< /Text>

My dogs love going to daycare they love the staff ,they are very playful with the dogs the facility is clean and always smells nice. We left are babies there when we had to leave town for few days on very short notice .Rick n Jessica were awesome ,they helped us out  when we needed someone to care for our babies . they even called us each day to let us know they were doing fine as i was stressing about being away at night  for first time ever when we returned they were happy to see us ,but wanted to stay at daycare  they got in the car n right back out .they get so excited when we go in the car and pull into daycare .</Review>

< Review>
MY DOG WAS KILLED HERE. My family and I boarded our two dogs in hopes that they’d be in a safe place for a weekend away. I showed up to find my little yorkie was killed by a dog double her size.. We received no calls phone calls about the incident. I had to find out when I walked in to take them home. Later found out she was killed the morning before due to negligence. Think, how can a 25lb dog be contained with other pups who are 10lbs or less let alone not having anyone on site to stop the fighting. They reported on video camera that they were playing, yet there’s an obvious difference between the two. We were also told mixed up stories from the staff. One was that it looked like they were playing on the video camera, the next time they said there were no footage due to that play area having a blind spot.. I asked to see our dog and was told they didn’t know where the body was.. yet was also told the staff put ice on her deceased body the previous night. They were preventing us from seeing those conditions!
While all this was happening we could not get ahold of the owner, let alone he never ever contacted us during this whole situation nor to follow up afterwards.
We were allowed to see our little London until later that night when we called in a cremation company to come pick up her body. The owner was finally at the facility and before talking to us, he was asking the worker how to make her body look presentable.. Obviously the owner does not know how to run a professional business let alone doggy care!
We found our poor little London in a storage box stuffed with blankets and ice strewn and melting over her dead body. Not even the decency to put ice bags to keep her body dry..
Talking to the owner all we felt was lack of compassion, lack of responsibility, and lack of care for this nightmare we were enduring.
Not to mention we still haven’t been reimbursed for their stay and a future one we’ve booked for Christmas. No phone calls received. We’ve been nothing but ignored and left with no compassion for a family member we so tragically lost.
A terrible way to lose an animal. She did not deserve to go this way.. being locked God knows where without us even knowing.
DON’T LET WHAT HAPPENED TO US HAPPEN TO YOU.
If you love your pups please please don’t bring them here. Also for discretion, please read the other reviews. We have found other incidents and another on google reviews that someone else’s pup was killed too!<//Review>

<review>My dog and I absolutely love it here. This is a great family run company, with a great value. I'm a very protective pet parent, but I feel confident I'm leaving my baby somewhere wonderful when I bring her here. I love how they put pictures on their Facebook page everyday, so when I'm at work I get to see my baby Darby playing with her other friends! I would definitely recommend this place to any pet parent whose baby needs some extra exercise and socialization during the day. Did I mention they also do cage-free boarding?!?!< /review></record>

< review>
the owner, Rick, is messed up.  On the outside, he seems friendly.  But once we leave, he is mean spirited.
People don’t know that he’s mean to the dogs in the back AND he treats his employees like slaves.  I heard him yelling at a worker that he isn’t going to pay all of the hours they worked.  And 1 of the worker came to the front in tears.  She told me what happened and I heard it.

I heard that his daughter stolen a huge amount of money by taking people’s CC # and put the amount we pay in her account.   When confronted Rick noded yes.
Our CC #’s r not safe.  Rick won’t press charges and I’m not comfortable with lack of dealing with it.

I stopped coming to that shop.<//review>

<Review>I had a friend who was employed there recently who is fearful to write a review but has told me about the terrible treatment the dogs experience. Shock collars and muzzles are used without owners permission . They don’t walk the dogs ever. There left in bathroom and laundry room for long periods of time. If you love your pet do not take them here.< /Review>< Pics>

They are amazing! If you have an active dog.... this is the place to bring him/her! Their prices are very competitive (you even get more bang for your buck - I think). They went above and beyond what's considered "the norm" of today.  They have exceeded my expectations and I will DEFINITELY BE brining Meila back within the next week or two<//review>

<text>Our dog snoopy gets so excited everyday we drop him off at Sanders k9*doggie*day*care, he sMiles, at us saying thank-you Mom and dad,. Snoopy can't wait to go hang out with other dog pals. We have been coming to k9-inn,
for almost 3years. Staff are so nice to us and our dog snoopy.  Owner Rick is kind and funny too. His family like atmosphere is way better than stuffy,other places. This place is our dogs 2nd home. And that is a great feeling. You can really feel the unique and genuine love all around here. Oh the groomer, is a special treat for the night on the town our dog snoopy. Or sometimes we just get him a bath, and blow dry.👍<//text>< Gmap_id>

MY DOG WAS KILLED HERE. My family and I boarded our two dogs in hopes that they’d be in a safe place for a weekend away. I showed up to find my little yorkie was killed by a dog double her size.. We received no calls phone calls about the incident. I had to find out when I walked in to take them home. Later found out she was killed the morning before due to negligence. Think, how can a 25lb dog be contained with other pups who are 10lbs or less let alone not having anyone on site to stop the fighting. They reported on video camera that they were playing, yet there’s an obvious difference between the two. We were also told mixed up stories from the staff. One was that it looked like they were playing on the video camera, the next time they said there were no footage due to that play area having a blind spot.. I asked to see our dog and was told they didn’t know where the body was.. yet was also told the staff put ice on her deceased body the previous night. They were preventing us from seeing those conditions!
While all this was happening we could not get ahold of the owner, let alone he never ever contacted us during this whole situation nor to follow up afterwards.
We were allowed to see our little London until later that night when we called in a cremation company to come pick up her body. The owner was finally at the facility and before talking to us, he was asking the worker how to make her body look presentable.. Obviously the owner does not know how to run a professional business let alone doggy care!
We found our poor little London in a storage box stuffed with blankets and ice strewn and melting over her dead body. Not even the decency to put ice bags to keep her body dry..
Talking to the owner all we felt was lack of compassion, lack of responsibility, and lack of care for this nightmare we were enduring.
Not to mention we still haven’t been reimbursed for their stay and a future one we’ve booked for Christmas. No phone calls received. We’ve been nothing but ignored and left with no compassion for a family member we so tragically lost.
A terrible way to lose an animal. She did not deserve to go this way.. being locked God knows where without us even knowing.
DON’T LET WHAT HAPPENED TO US HAPPEN TO YOU.
If you love your pups please please don’t bring them here. Also for discretion, please read the other reviews. We have found other incidents and another on google reviews that someone else’s pup was killed too!<//text>

<username>Hau Wang<//username><gmapID>0x80dd2a078a3c1c55:0x6201e0658ccc40f0</gmapID><review>MY DOG WAS KILLED HERE.  I purposely put that in caps to warn all other dog owners from bringing their dogs here.  We left our baby Charlie with Rick and his crew and over Memorial Day Weekend not knowing that it would be the last time we would see her alive.  One day into our vacation, we got a text message from one of the staff members telling us to call them back.  When we called back, they informed us that Charlie was killed by another dog.  Our 5lb toy poodle was killed by a 50+ lb greyhound mix that jumped over a divider into the small dog area which the staff did nothing about.  What is most upsetting is that her death could have been prevented.  Video footage showed that the large dog was in the small dog area for an extended period of time (40 minutes) and the staff did nothing to have the large dog removed.  First off, the divider should be higher so that larger dogs can not even hop over to the small dog area.  Second, it was completely irresponsible for the staff do nothing about the big dog until it was too late.  The way Rick handled the situation after our dog was killed was even more disgusting.  When we went in to go over what had happened, Rick expressed no remorse.  All he cared about was was himself and his business.  He refused to accept any responsibility for the situation and had the nerve to tell me and my fiance that “dogs are considered property in the state of California and we are not in a position to sue” even though we were there to just figure out exactly what happened to our dog.  Our dog was our baby and thanks to K9 Sanders, we will never get to see her again.  Rick and his staff at K9 Sanders failed us and our dog Charlie.  They should not be able to continue running a business with their gross negligence and unprofessionalism.  We hope that no dog owner ever has to experience the grief and pain me and my fiance have been through with the death of our dog Charlie.<//review>< pictures>

SCARY. Checked out when looking for a sitter for just a couple hrs & wld never leave my tiny fur baby here. Check PD's sites as mentioned in other reviews & hope the ownerS whos dogs were killed here get legal representation. As well, I believe most of the positive reviews I checked were fake. It was the only review that they had written in most cases, ect.<//Text>

My dog and I absolutely love it here. This is a great family run company, with a great value. I'm a very protective pet parent, but I feel confident I'm leaving my baby somewhere wonderful when I bring her here. I love how they put pictures on their Facebook page everyday, so when I'm at work I get to see my baby Darby playing with her other friends! I would definitely recommend this place to any pet parent whose baby needs some extra exercise and socialization during the day. Did I mention they also do cage-free boarding?!?!<//review>

People don’t know that he’s mean to the dogs in the back AND he treats his employees like slaves.  I heard him yelling at a worker that he isn’t going to pay all of the hours they worked.  And 1 of the worker came to the front in tears.  She told me what happened and I heard it.

I heard that his daughter stolen a huge amount of money by taking people’s CC # and put the amount we pay in her account.   When confronted Rick noded yes.
Our CC #’s r not safe.  Rick won’t press charges and I’m not comfortable with lack of dealing with it.

I stopped coming to that shop.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dd2a078a3c1c55:0x6201e0658ccc40f0< /gmap_id></record>

Do not board your dog here! I don’t live in the area anymore but when I did I greatly consider this place as an option for my dogs. So happy I decided not to! Check out Fullerton PD latest Instagram post! Sheesh! Poor doggies.< /Review>

I had a friend who was employed there recently who is fearful to write a review but has told me about the terrible treatment the dogs experience. Shock collars and muzzles are used without owners permission . They don’t walk the dogs ever. There left in bathroom and laundry room for long periods of time. If you love your pet do not take them here.</review>

<text>We had taken our dogs to Sanders to stay for a few days when we're traveling and the place takes good care of them feed them well, they have play time, they don't mix small breeds with large ones and over all the staff it's great.

Totally recommended.<//text>< user_name>

<username>zsan zsan< /username><Text>They are amazing! If you have an active dog.... this is the place to bring him/her! Their prices are very competitive (you even get more bang for your buck - I think). They went above and beyond what's considered "the norm" of today.

Our dog snoopy gets so excited everyday we drop him off at Sanders k9*doggie*day*care, he sMiles, at us saying thank-you Mom and dad,. Snoopy can't wait to go hang out with other dog pals. We have been coming to k9-inn,
for almost 3years. Staff are so nice to us and our dog snoopy.  Owner Rick is kind and funny too. His family like atmosphere is way better than stuffy,other places. This place is our dogs 2nd home. And that is a great feeling. You can really feel the unique and genuine love all around here. Oh the groomer, is a special treat for the night on the town our dog snoopy. Or sometimes we just get him a bath, and blow dry.👍<//Text>

This place gives itself fake inaccurate reviews. Fullerton pd discovered they had been running a drug business and by the looks of the photos doesn’t seem like it’s very cleanly..< /review>

Had a CC account for more than 2 years with very few problems until just recently. Follow-up from tech support was not that prompt or great. Had a hard time communicating with agent on other end. Could have been my new phone service or my office phone. Still better than other internet providers.< /Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>unfortunately it seems they are on a downward spiral.
Over the past years I was impressed with their tech support when there was a problem. They were friendly and pro-active.
Lately though, this has not been the case. I just got off the phone with support, the tech sounded like a cocky 15yr old.
Things seemed to have changed with the business. This usually means bad management, and the "bad" trickles down from there.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<text>Very disappointed. Have been a customer for many years. They cancelled all digital phones. Had to choose between a pots line and a hosted line. Hosted was cheaper but only the pots line compatable with security systems and medical devices. Customer service is terrible. They did Not advise we would lose caller id on the pots line. Of course they would add it for more money. The pots line costs more than the hosted. They apparently enjoy sticking it to seniors. Don't  use this company they are not trustworthy!</text>< pics>

<review>Disconnected our service after more than two years of paying every month. Customer service is absolutely horrible. Can't get ahold of anyone and as soon as you get through they hang up. Literally have wasted half the day trying to get our internet back on. Definitely switching service after this experience.

Consolidated communications is garbage.< /review>< Name>

<review>I had this service for about six years, and about every-other month my rate went up with no explanation. It was extremely random as my son had the exact same service 2 miles away for a completely different rate. I canceled my service after calling them to discuss my rate, being left on hold for an extensive period of time, and receiving a total shrug off when someone did finally answer. Their customer service is severely lacking!<//review>< pictures>

I’ve had many internet companies over the years, but this one is the absolute WORST. I recently upgraded my service after 4 years to a faster speed, and proceeded with my account on auto-pay. Come to find out that your account comes with a “threshold” setting that limits the amount they can charge you? Never heard of it. They disconnected our service for non-payment, so I had to log on and increase the “threshold” setting which I did. Well apparently increasing it to well over what my monthly charges are, still wasn’t enough with the reconnection charges, and the 2 months that they tried to put through at once. I didn’t find this out until much later. They disconnected us A SECOND TIME, and both times were without notice. We assumed there was an outage because their website said Sac was experiencing one, so waited for 2 weeks before realizing why it was turned off. THEN I found out that they CONTINUE CHARGING YOU WHILE YOU HAVE NO SERVICE. How is that even legal!?? The first time I called customer service I waited for an hour to get through. The agent continued to tell me like a robot that my service was turned off because I didn’t pay my bill. How can that be, when I am on auto-pay and my account is perfectly good. How is it my fault that there is a “threshold” issue that you have to go digging into their system to find?? I asked her to credit me for the time I didn’t have service and she said that doesn’t ever happen. After refusing to help me, she hung up on me (no call back). So I decided to contact them via email. No response after a week.
So I reported them to the BBB.
I called again today after I got a text (first one since this happened) and got someone much nicer on the phone, but same response, they don’t credit for time you don’t have service. So I asked to be transferred to someone else, and FINALLY this agent agreed to credit me for 2 of the weeks (I’ll take it) and one reconnection fee (there were 2). They told me they sent out 2 disconnection notices (never got them) and 2 emails which I also never received. If I had received them, why wouldn’t I respond ASAP knowing that our service was turned off and it wasn’t an actual outage?? This is the craziest company I have ever done business with. They probably realize that a lot of people don’t have other choices, and therefore they can get away with this BS. I am switching the minute something else becomes available in my area. They DO NOT care about you as a customer, and they have ZERO integrity. Now you are warned!!</Text>

<Text>Zero upgrades in 20 years.  Pathetic Internet service, zero investment in the rural communities they inherited from Roseville Telephone.  Thank God we finally got a wireless ISP and Starlink coming soon.   Dropped off the POS 12 megabit DSL box today (for $57.00 / month) and hello 150 megabit wireless for $10 less.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
In short: bad customer service, bad tech support, and no appreciation for long time customers.
Just like many others in our community, I am working from home and my daughters are attending school online. We have always had poor connectivity and our WiFi is weak. After my daughter spent two days getting dropped from her zoom classes I decided we have had enough. I called the technical support phone number, the tech took my phone number in case we were disconnected which we were right after I explained the issues. He never called back. I called again and spoke with someone else. He said the issue was not on their end and our computer was probably broken (it’s less than a year old and we have trouble on all of our WiFi devices). I’m lucky enough to have a good friend in IT who came over and measured our signal strength in all of our rooms. He got us connected to the right WiFi and even changed the channel we were on as all of my neighbors are using the same one. He suggested I also increase our speed to support some of my daughters games (she complains they lag). We looked up our plan only to find out the plan we pay for doesn’t even exist (we’ve been customers for 10 years). The current plan for what we pay would triple our speed. So great to find out you have been paying more for less. I called to inquire about increasing our speed- by the way you have to sign a one year contract and can not downgrade if you do not notice improved speed! The wait time was over 30 min. I explained all of the above- it was clear I was wasting her time. I asked for any sort of deal for loyal customers or for the fact we have been overpaying. I was told there are no exceptions, the prices online are the prices (actually those prices do not include another $10.00 a month in service fees plus taxes!) I was frustrated with her response so I hung up. I called back today thinking I should talk to a supervisor who might be more willing to keep our business. Another 30+ min wait. I requested to speak to a supervisor and was told they would have to call me back in 24-48 hours! It is clear this company does not care about ensuring the service they provide is working properly. Nor do they care about the loyalty  and retention of customers. We will absolutely be changing to another provider.
It’s been several days since CCI reached out below. I provided my contact information to speak to their “escalation team”, no one ever called.</Review>

Consolidated provides poor quality service. The slowest internet speed for way to much money. Very few channels for way to much money. They have no offices at all anywhere in sac  or roseville. If you want to get ripped off and inconvenienced this is the place to go........ after a long hard fight and this bad review their home office reached out to me and did what they could to make things right and we came to a settlement I appreciated their effort<//Text>

I recently missed my payment due date by a couple of days. I promptly paid it as soon as I realized the mistake. I am outraged that I received a disconnect notice!! At this time of health and financial crises for this country I think it’s despicable that you would threaten cutoff!! Students are relying on this access to keep up with their education!! Most people are working from home if at all possible! You must do what you can to help this community through this uncertain time!<//Review>

I cannot believe CC is still in business ..... internet always going down and raised my bill for basics from $119 mo to $189!!!

I highly recommend Direct TV bundle .... it’s actually AT&T now and we finally have the service out in Granite Bay !! They are running a promotion right now for TV 185 channels and Internet for $103 mo including taxes AND a $300 Visa card in 4 weeks 👍☀️< /Text>

They are the worst. We had service installed. The installer neglected to connect two outlets. When I discover the error I called and consolidate told me they would happily come back and connect the two outlets they missed (they put the outlets in the wall but did not wire them.) Only one small catch, they said it would cost $99 per outlet for the technician to wire them up. The total number of outlets and their locations were on the work order. Avoid this company any.< /Review>

< Review>
Internet goes down everyday for several minutes.  Attempted several times to contact support; using multiple ways.  Attempted using their contact form through member portal (multiple times), no reply.  Called their tech support; agent Denise playing games, disconnected first call; called back since it was early am when internet went down; and she could hear me; then after i explained the issue she started playing the "are you there" game.  I was placed on mute; as she was trying to get me to hang up.  Call was 50 minutes and just ran her queue times up.  Internet is not reliable.  Staff does not seem to care and bill is getting more expensive.  Looking for alternatives after loving their service for years.  It's time for the company to address the issues of a failing backbone; poor customer service, and under trained staff. There are tools out there that customers have to monitor our devices and internet connection to identify where the problems are.<//Review>

< Review>
I just moved to Rocklin on 9-1-2019 and Consolidated Communications is the only company providing internet/tv and phone services.
Since I’m a new customer I called to have new service connected. There’s 8-12 days wait for a tech to show up. How horrible of service is that!!!
Xfinity offered same day and AT&T 1-2 days service where I used to live.
This is very bad service on CC for 10 days.
They came on the 10th day for 8:40am appointment and they showed up 40 min late and I was gone before they showed up.
I gave them my number to call me before showing up.
No call, late show up = Horrible service...
As soon as Xfinity or AT&T will Service our area I’ll be switching in a heartbeat.

Attempted several times to contact support; using multiple ways.  Attempted using their contact form through member portal (multiple times), no reply.  Called their tech support; agent Denise playing games, disconnected first call; called back since it was early am when internet went down; and she could hear me; then after i explained the issue she started playing the "are you there" game.  I was placed on mute; as she was trying to get me to hang up.  Call was 50 minutes and just ran her queue times up.  Internet is not reliable.  Staff does not seem to care and bill is getting more expensive.  Looking for alternatives after loving their service for years.  It's time for the company to address the issues of a failing backbone; poor customer service, and under trained staff. There are tools out there that customers have to monitor our devices and internet connection to identify where the problems are.</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1546456784275, 'text': 'Hi Trevor, we are sorry to hear this.

I was a customer since this was Winfirst and all thru the Surewest years too. So at least 15 years. I'm moving out of town and they wouldn't come and pick up their router. I had to drive to Roseville (from Arden/Watt) and back. Upon canceling, the guy didn't even thank me for being a customer for so many years. Oh, and after canceling, they make it so you can no longer pay online (to pay the final bill).

Since becoming Consolidated, the internet service can be glitchy, but when it's working, it's fast.< /Review>

<Text>Very poor customer service, wait times over 15minutes numerous times. No offering of new deals to existing customers while paying more than new customers. Customer service has no concept of what is actually provisioned and misquoted me, now service man is at my home telling me I cannot have what was quoted and I have been waiting 30 minutes while he waits for phone call to figure out what he is supposed to do......no consistency whatsoever, sounds like much confusion on all levels of company. Way too many apologies by all employees at all levels to take serious....don't apologize for a service I pay for if you cannot keep up then get out of the  business or improve your operations stop apologizing for doing lousy work,  you sound pathetic. Each response in your reviews starts with "we are sorry" HOW SAD</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1529433201878, 'text': 'Hi Tim - we understand the frustration and would like to get this over to our escalations team so they can help.

Internet service is great when use is low but when a lot of people are using it lags terribly. In a nut shell they oversubscribe the service and their network infrastructure can't keep up when in high demand. Don't bother calling support, all they will say is they can't see a problem and try rebooting your router.<//Review>

I've had Consolidated since it first came into Sacramento as Surewest.  I have always found their customer service and technical service people to be responsive and helpful beyond expectations, and I've been able to connect with technical assistance at odd hours.  Their Internet speed at one time was the fastest available to consumers; and while I don't keep up with mbps stats, whatever I am receiving here works just fine for me.  I would give them 5 stars if they had not closed their Sacramento office.</review>

Good customer service when you can get a hold of them. Their schedule is like yours and you will need to set yourself a special reminder if, or rather, when you need to speak with them about your account.

Service is average in Performance and content. Not good or bad.

Price is high for the value< /review>

In the community we live in Consolidated is the only service available. They advertise that we can get 20 mbps and that is the service we pay for. This has nothing to do with the WIFI I need to make that clear since techs usually like to blame reception.  I ran direct CAT5 to the router and it makes no difference the speed is the same with either connection.

We seldom get as much as 14 mbsp no matter what time of the day we test and if anyone else is using internet or not. We complained that we weren't getting the speed we pay for and they said we need a new modem. They sent someone out he replaced the modem did some signal testing and asked my wife is your internet working now, and left.

Basically it was just lip service because we have no change the speed is the same as it was before he came. They just came to appease us since there was really nothing they could do to improve their pitiful internet service.</text>

They have some sort of outage regarding their DVR service since last night. It's now 9pm next night, service still unavailable. I understand somerines things happen, I am giving them one start because of their customer service now in regards to this outage. I just was on hold for over 20 minutes and they have not bothered to put noticed on line about outage, only terrible hold where you don't even know if your still on hold, just static. I work in computer area, simple thing to put recording saying that they are having outage and are working on it, much better then routing customer to line that only gives static. Again outages are a part of life, but how you handle it and your customer service is can be improved!<//text>

When I signed up a couple years ago I got a great deal, but they raise their prices like every 6 months, so I am now paying nearly double for meh internet. I think I'm going to switch companies soon. The customer service has been nice though.< /Text>

We have been with CCI ever since Surwest switched over. We had decent service when it first switched over but as many years have gone by its just gotten worse. Poor internet connections, always buffering on my tv, controllers never work and constantly have to replace along with the tv boxes, the service team never gets back to you in a timely manner, the DVR service always shuts down as has to be reset and last but not least the bill has climbed from $80 a month to $190 with nothing to show for ( all i have is tv and internet too!) I can say i will be moving to another company come tomorrow. Lets cross our fingers Xfinity is has better service<//review>

<text>0 stars. If anyone reads these, please read this one, and save yourself a headache. This company has some of the most unprofessional customer service that I have ever encountered. (ever wanted to be signed up for a one year contract without your consent? or have someone talk down to you when you are asking why you are being charge three times as much as you should be? You've got it in spades.) Customer beware. (I have a suspicion that anyone posting a positive review is someone with an interest in the company...)<//text>< username>

<Review>I will start by saying  that the drop off location was not busy and easy to find.  And the person that helped us did what he could I think.  My grandparents were the customers and have passed.  We received a bill exceeding $1,000 dollars for the equipment.  So we returned what was asked for.  2 cable boxes and 2 VAP's (huh?) and corresponding power/connection cords (no serial numbers to identify what was needed)  We delivered the 4 items with all connections and remotes.  We were told the final bill is $125 or so for last months service.  When we made sure we were signed off and all equipment was returned we were told we were missing ONE internet box and that matched the final charge (so it wasn't service)  We returned back to my deceased grandparents home and removed every box from the TV.

< Review>
Tried to get ahold of a technical support person on a Sunday because we were getting spam e-mail.  A woman answered who did not seem to know much and tried to help by having me log into my Surewest account. When I told her I could not log in she changed my password. At that point, I could not receive any e-mail which was not the intent of my call. I just wanted to stop getting Spam. She then could not figure out how to fix the password problem. I asked to speak to a higher level tech and she said she would transfer me and I sat there and no one answered the phone for about 20 minutes so I hung up and called again. The same woman answered technical support. She must be the only one working on a Sunday. I asked her to transfer me to a higher level tech because she not only did not fix my problem but now I cannot get into e-mail at all because the password she changed my account to does not work.  I immediately got disconnected or she just hung up on me.  Now I am mad and trying to call back once again and no one is answering.</Review>

<text>Consolidated communications is the worst cable company of all times. They start off cheap but then for internet and TV it was costing me 218.00 a month. TV that had no movie channels, paid movies were too expensive 7.99 per movie. I switched to a new TV and internet service. I am very happy.</text>< UserId.>

<Text>I will start by saying  that the drop off location was not busy and easy to find.  And the person that helped us did what he could I think.  My grandparents were the customers and have passed.  We received a bill exceeding $1,000 dollars for the equipment.  So we returned what was asked for.  2 cable boxes and 2 VAP's (huh?) and corresponding power/connection cords (no serial numbers to identify what was needed)  We delivered the 4 items with all connections and remotes.  We were told the final bill is $125 or so for last months service.  When we made sure we were signed off and all equipment was returned we were told we were missing ONE internet box and that matched the final charge (so it wasn't service)  We returned back to my deceased grandparents home and removed every box from the TV.  CC owned 3 of them.  Problem was solved.   My concern is this.  If the equipment is that expensive why are you relying on people that have no idea what they're looking at or unhooking to deliver product back to you after paying YOUR COMPANY every month.  Especially in very sensitive condions like this?  Two trips to your dropoff location during a very sad time.  Was $100 worth it to you guys?

I strongly recommend consolidated communications because their representatives like them nicest people I’ve ever met and I have many good reasons why I can wrap them and their service to my friends and people I know for Wi-Fi service TV service and more I am a really big fan of consolidated so if you’re looking for TV service and Internet service or business service or phone service get consolidated communications< /Review>

<text>I've had this company as my internet provider for a few months now and I can't say anything positive about them. My bill has gone up 2x since I've had them and I always pay my bill early and not to mention the connection is so crappy. I get to watch a show for 10 minutes and it can't find service and than it says I have no freaking internet connection. My TV and modem are right next to each other. Thinking about switching services soon unless this company can make things right. I was given a guarantee before starting up my service that my bill would never go up and so far this company yes not stood by there word.<//text><userid>113780395280588999280</userid><GmapID>0x809b20384543708d:0x37cc0fc2e9476b27</GmapID>< user_name>

Getting service installed, adding services: great! Reducing service, ending service, billing questions: awful! Trying to talk to customer service about any issues is next to impossible...long wait times. Either CCI does not have enough personnel to handle the volume of inquiries, or the volume is overwhelmingly large (both options present a differeent set of problems with this company). Be very wary of the "free trials," as you receie no notificatin once the trial period is over; you just receive a much larger bill!
I am happy to no longer have cable tv; my antenna gives me enough to satisfy me!< /review>

We are paying for the highest speed they have and we are getting 0.53 download. I have contacted them 10 times and they don't know how to fix the problem. I would never use this company out of choice but they have a monopoly in our area and we have no choice.</text>

UPDATED: Honestly, over the past few years the quality of this company has gone downhill since it went from being Surewest to Consolidated. Basically, if you are in an area that gets their fiber, go for it as it was fast, reliable and way cheaper than their competitor. But other than that it's just okay, not really the best in town which is disappointing as I'd rather support a local ISP.

In the first few years I had them, the fiber was great and I never had an outage, and was relatively inexpensive. Then a few years ago I moved to an area that didn't have their fiber but had dsl. Generally the speeds weren't THAT bad but it over time got worse.  The internet would slow down, they'd offer no solution other than "we are working on it." The phone line was staticy. Then the prices started jumping up on our bills once by almost DOUBLE without warning and without any expiring offers, which although they "fixed" it I was upset they did it in the first place.

The last problem was an outage caused by a traffic accident that has yet to be fixed correctly.  My neighbors who have the service have the same issue, and all of us have called the company to report slow or interrupted internet and TV and nothing has been done.  A "we will look into it" and yet no techs have been sent out.  So I had to go to their competitor.< /Text>

<text>Due to the continued Refurbished Equipment we are losing all recorded programs, movies and special events of us seen of TV due to this lack of customer services.  If CCI really cared about their consumers they would have new equipment for their customers.  We have been informed by CCI so called Customer Service that the entire state was rebooted and now there is a state wide ERROR of there REFURBISHED EQUIPMENT.  Hmm, now we the Consumer are paying the price, lack of services we pay for, lack of NEW Equipment and lack of putting the Consumer First.  If we were given the New Equipment we pay for, I'm sure this state wide ERROR would not have occurred.</text>< Pics>

I was unable to give them 1/2 star so this is why they get only one star.  I canceled my service after 17 years which started with Surewest and became consolidated communications.   The Customer Service became more and more unfavorable and the actual equipment and service was subpar .  The Internet was probably the slowest we’ve ever experienced.   When I notified the company when they had gone up on their rates and asked why the Internet was so slow they said that I had the highest bandwidth they offer .  I finally decided that I would discontinue our service and we have decided to go with Xfinity which we like so far.  When I came to their Roseville office, which was only one of two offered here in Sacramento to return your equipment, There were four desks with people at them as you first walk in and no other customers.  Stood there waiting to be called forward and not one person looked up to say I’ll be right with you or to say hello nothing.  I finally Ask if someone can help me return my equipment.  When I left not that they really cared I did let them know that it’s always good to at least greet people when they come through the door and I told them that their customer service was so bad but it confirmed my decision to discontinue business with this company.  I will say that losing a phone number that I’ve had for 17 years was even worth Not dealing with this company any longer.<//text>

<review>My connections, both TV and Internet went out on Sunday Feb 27th. Called them, seemed like I went thru the general troubleshooting over the phone and was told a tech would need to come out...no connections for 2 days and no Oscars which were on that night. I found it odd with the discussions about the lack of nominees for the black community that cable went out but it did come back on magical the morning after. I find this suspicious and no explained nor call back of what happened. No outages reported on their graph on web page. Would be nice if they would let us know, again I find it suspicious.

<user_id>118329200942551304743< /user_id><Text>Super fast internet,  I had fiber 50/50.    I love their upload speed.  Never had any issues.  And I HATE their customer service and billing policies and how they deal with clients.   It sucks big time!!!!   Super weird people.   They raised my internet to $93 a month and I call them and say can you please get me in a contract and lower my payment.  Rep says I'll lower by $3 from $93 to $90, so I switch to Xfinity.  Next day my relative tells me when he called Consolidated they offered him $50 for 100 mb/s up and down.  Yet I was asking for $70 for 50mb/50 mb and they said no.   I guess Consolidated Rep had a bad day or they are on a commission so they get to up sell internet packages?  I'm not sure whats going on but I called next week and they signed me up $50 for 100 up/down just as website says!  But I had to wait 2 weeks for installer to come out and look at my equipment.  I asked them to active my line because everything was ready to go but they said they can't until installer comes out.   Installer came out said yes you don't need anything made a call and my internet started to work.  Yet I called Consolidated 3 times and they were keep refusing activating my line right of way.   Policies...  Oh yes if you miss payment by few days they disconnect internet, they don't have 30 days grace period like everyone else.</Text>< Date>

Great service and excellent price. Only drawback is that their app is FAR behind competition (no scheduling of DVR or watching stored content). But internet srrvice speed is amazing and TV is rock solid with no outages. Fast and friendly service when I've had problems including a fast fix when siding workmen broke the cable to my house.</Review>

This service is THE WORST! The DVR has not worked in months. I called customer service and after a hour of being on the phone they finally agreed to send someone out.

The service guy switched out the box but the very next day the DVR was not working and I had the same problem.

I called them back (and after waiting on hold for 27 minutes) and the lady wanted my phone number in case we go disconnected. Within 3 minutes of our call we got disconnected.

After waiting 10 minutes and no call back, I called them back. Different service guy on the phone, wanted my number in case we got disconnected and the same thing happened again! I keep giving up and weeks will go by with no DVR. The I try again hoping for a better result! Nope. Same crappy service!

This happened a few more times over the last few months. I am so frustrated! I can't believe "Communications" is in their name! This is THE WORST communication and customer service  I have every from a cable/phone or whatever!

I'm done!<//text>

<Text>So I spent just about an hour on the phone waiting for them to pick up as well as waiting over and hour for their call back feature.  I need help with my account and when I get someone on the phone they just transfer me to another department.  This is  very sad to have to deal with this level of customer service.  I have been with this company ever since SureWest was bought out by CC.  I have been very faithful to this company and it is concerning when I cant find someone to help me with an account issue.  if you are thinking about using this company for  your internet, TV, or phone I would say that it is not worth it if you expect good customer service. I still think they have the best internet to offer in my area but if this continues I don't know if it is worth it.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I’ve been a customer for a long time. Was a previous Surewest customer and was grandfathered in when Consolidated Communications bought them out. I’ve had issues with my router that I’ve been renting from Consolidated. So after some research I purchased a DSL modem router from bestbuy.   Nobody was willing to help me over the phone, I was constantly told that the only router I can use is the one they provide. (completely untrue!) The router I purchased is the same model and brand as the one they are trying to rent me. It’s just not a “bonded” version set up for Consolidated. I no longer wanted to pay 120 dollars a year for their router when I can buy the same one for around 100 dollars. They offered me to pay for better technical support to set it up. (which I refused) The technical support representative on the phone just repeatedly told me I can’t use another router or modem, again, completely untrue!! After hours of confusion and different people telling me I could use the router and some people telling me I couldn’t, I decided to give up on technical support because they were completely unwilling to help me because I didn’t want to rent the router from them. After no help from anyone I decided to tackle the situation myself and, yes, I DID get my router and modem working. I just had to find the DNS and set a few settings on my router modem. No reason an employee could not of helped me. This company is greedy and will do anything to stay a float by forcing people to rent their routers.

After hours of setting up my new router and finally getting it working (no thanks to customer support) I’ve decided to switch to xfinity. I’ve realized I’ve been over paying for slow internet, im paying 40 dollars a month for 55mbps with xfinity. Oh, They also have a list of all combatable modems on their website and they were completely willing to help me set it up, free of charge!</Review>

<text>I've had CCI since they first came to Sacramento (then Surewest).  I've always had great connections, both cable and wireless, for my TV, phone, and computer.  They also offer faster service for gamers.  I've had to call for technical issues a couple times at weird hours, but there was someone there to answer the phone and provide help.  When I required a service visit, the service technician was professional and fixed my problem.  The only drawback is that you may have to wait a few days to get a service appointment and that's a bummer when your TV or computer is down.  Also, they closed the Sacramento store, so now I have to drive to Roseville to get a new remote.  :(</text>< username>

Changed services from Xfinity to Consolidated. What a diapapointment. Constant loss of signal, super slow speed and I got the fastest they offered. My kids are home schooled so when it loses the signal they have to do their essays and other work all over again. I am trying to get my bills under control so that is why I swiched. AT&T please move into our area.<//review>

<text>After they bought SureWest customer service became totally useless.
It is a bit annoying to be on hold... but after being on hold received a message "our agents are busy call back later" - is just priceless.
And yes - if you leave your number and ask to call back - they do not.
Too bad. Here goes another once successful regional business.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Multiple unsuccessful attempts to update the account.  My Father was on his "wife's" account to use his # he has had since 1960.The "wife" died, but father is not able to close the original account and use his old number.  DAD IS 92, blind and hard of hearing. He is eligible for a reduced phone rate but can't utilize it unless I take his DPOA and ID to this office in a neighboring town.  I have spent hours with customer service attempting to changing PIN, Only to find during the next inquiry it still hasn't been changed. What a nightmare this company is.< /Review>

i tried to schedule an appointment for someone to come down and check our connection because there's a lose cable on the modem, every 5 minutes the tv and internet gets off and if you try to touch and push that cable it gets back, but then the guy that i spoke to told me that there is a service fee for it eventhough there will be no cables or parts to be replaced. last time they come and change the modem again cause they said its an old one like a 2 year old already, how come its an old one we just got our service... you have to fix your very poor service.</text>

<text>My dad is suffering through the worse customer experience with Consolidated. We tried connecting a new laptop to his wifi and had no luck.  Called consolidated and they're walked us through multiple steps that didn't work.  They said they would call back within 24 hours (worse case).  It has now been 48 hours and no call.  My dad has called back twice in the meantime seeking help.  Bring back surewest.<//text>< pics>

Absolute trash, you're lucky if the internet even stays up for an hour at least 5-15 times a day you have to shut off the router and turn it back on and most of the times that doesn't work at all. This is a grabage company and price is too High for the trash that you are paying for, swith to a different company you won't regret it.</text>

<review>Terrible customer service.  Not the same since Surewest was bought out by Consolidated communications! Their customer service person promises you one thing and their automated billing system tell yous another!  Needless to say that process is less than acceptable.  When you do reach a customer service person, no one gives you a consistent answer!!  Will be changing carriers as soon as my contract is up!< /review><username>ANN MARIE R.< /username><Time>1440888239035<//Time><Response>None< /Response>< Rating>

Too expensive compared to other options.  We were at the point that we'd have to reset our router (their router that they charged us a monthly fee for) at least 5 times a day (if you didn't do a reset we got major packet loss and our DL speeds were 1/2 a meg.) We needed to move the modem to another location in our house and they told us there would be a fee for that (we couldn't' just unplug it from one outlet and plug it in another).  When I called in to price shop (we'd been with them for a few years) the lady that I spoke with cut me off several times and when I asked if I could finish what I was saying she started throwing major attitude and started yelling.  I hung up and knew then that it was time to switch.  The fastest internet that they would offer was 6 megs down and 1.5 megs up (for $35 a month).  We got 100 down and 7 up through another provider for $30 a month.  Happily leaving them for our home service and we've already left them for our business.<//text>

<response>None< /response><text>These guys are really tricky about their pricing. When you go in and sign up (the first warning sign is they give you nothing to sign) they won't give you any estimates of what anything is going to cost, they tell you to wait till after the installation is done (the installer said they don't charge anything for installation. You have no idea untill you get hit with a bill that has all kinds of hidden fees. When I signed up they had a :No Service Contract Required" for the basic internet only at only $14.99 a month (after hiddenfees $23) which was perfect because I was temp staying somewhere. When I terminated the service and went in to turn in my equipment they told me I was under contract still and would have to pay for early determination. I told them I was under no contract, I would've never signed a contract and was informed it's an ORAL CONTRACT! A manager was suppose to contact me but instead I now have just recieved a bill which includes the early fine, another month of service it says was owing at time of termination (I had a week  of service available when I cancelled the service) and shows my monthly rate at the original cost before the special. I stupidly went paperless and didn't save any of the online statements and payments so now I'm going to have to battle them. It is so crazy it's not funny. Get everything in writing if you are forced to do business with them!!!!!!! I wouldn't even give them 1 star but you are forced to.< /text><time>1489436934878<//time><gmapID>0x809b20384543708d:0x37cc0fc2e9476b27<//gmapID>< rate>

<text>HORRIBLE internet speeds and some how even WORSE customer service. The fastest internet speed available for us is 10MB, which is what we pay for but on average we get under 1MB/s on our internet. And no this is not a problem with our set up in our home. We have triple checked everything there. This is Consolidated falsely advertising their product and not delivering on it at all. Customer service does absolutely nothing to help and instead tells you to call back when "someone who would know" is in the office. Terrible company that I would do anything to get away from.<//text>< pics>

I have been with Roseville Telephone, Surewest and now CCI since 2000.  RT customer service was off the hook great.  When the changed to Surewest the service was good then it slipped after a couple years.  They then had great service again. When they started buying stuff and building in Kansas City it fell again.  Then comes CCI,  as most of you know there customer service sucks!

Thank god I do not need customer service very often.  I have FTTH (Fiber To the House) and RT/Surewest built a great network.  I have never been down and my speeds have always been FAST!

I have had excellent service from SureWest, now Consolidated Communications. With gigabit service up and down, my only slow-down in Internet is the other end of a connection. In testing, most services in Northern California have very low ping times, usually less than 20 ms and frequently lower than 10 ms. My download speeds on speed tests is around 750-800 Mbps and upload speed tests are about 850-900 Mbps; true, not a full gigabit but that is just the theoretical speed. Most people are envious of the speeds I'm seeing. I do not subscribe to any other services other than Internet through Consolidated. I DO have a couple static IPs, which is nice as I run many personal servers for personal reasons that I like to access while out of the house. My home-built, FreeBSD-based router handles multiple static IPs well.<//Review>

Worst customer experience EVER!!! I was having troubles with my wifi connection and this company said they cannot guarantee wifi, and told me there is nothing they can do to help me. Can't guarantee wifi, what does this??!! When I asked to be transferred to cancel my service because of this inconvenience they did not try to retain my business what so ever, and told me to call back Monday as customer service was closed (it was 9:30 on a Saturday!!). If you are reading this and want to do business with a company that actually cares about their customers move on, this is not the company for you!!<//Text>

<review>I have been with Roseville Telephone, Surewest and now CCI since 2000.  RT customer service was off the hook great.  When the changed to Surewest the service was good then it slipped after a couple years.  They then had great service again. When they started buying stuff and building in Kansas City it fell again.  Then comes CCI,  as most of you know there customer service sucks!

Thank god I do not need customer service very often.  I have FTTH (Fiber To the House) and RT/Surewest built a great network.  I have never been down and my speeds have always been FAST!

<text>They aren't as bad as people make them out to be especially when you compare them to the competition like Comcast and their evil ways. If you are fortunate enough to have access to their fiber lines then you are definitely  in for the fastest internet in the area. And whatever speed you are buying is the speed you are going to get. Unlike Comcast who will say you are getting 100Mbps but will only ever sustain 20Mbps, if that. Consolidated Communications isn't all rainbows and butterflies though. They will take advantage of you if you are computer illiterate and/or old. Seriously, they will charge you the highest tier price and give you the slowest speeds and most elderly folks wont know the difference. Just make sure you are paying attention to what speed you are getting and what they are charging you. In the end, they are WAY better than Comcast  and they bring much needed competition to the market.<//text><time>1465837123947< /time><user>117057887114923870093</user><Rate>4<//Rate></record>

<GmapID>0x809b20384543708d:0x37cc0fc2e9476b27</GmapID><text>First off I wanna start by saying that I am 19 and as being a part of the young generation I like good internet service. Consolidated Communications is not one of them. Previously the company surewest supplied our home with internet and phone and have since been bought out by consolidated. Surewest was by no means anazing but the servhce was far better than consolidated service. I've taken it upon myself to consistently check Consolidated's speed and found that service you recieve is in pulses.

Think of taking a shower but your water comes out as if you were pumping it by hand. Now for most people this might seem ok but if you have anyone living in your household under 25 you will most likely be hearing complaints. These pulses will freeze your HD video and prevent you from doing things online that require continuous data such as playing online games or downloading large files.

Secondly, there customer service is horrible. The person you get to help you is hit or miss but they really can't help you outside of teaching you how to plug in the modem to your wall. You can argue all you want all theyll do is say you should buy a faster internet speed which will amount to nothing because they advertise their speeds as *up to* meaning if you recieve slower speeds than that if which you paid it is all part of the deal. And you definitley will get slower speeds.

Lastly, this may not matter to most but because consolidated still uses the old telephone wires underground, meaning you must be connected to a modem. "This is the alternative to being connected to the more modern wiring system which is called fiber. Fiber is much faster and more reliable but is not available in many areas around roseville." Now normally being connected to a modem is only a small inconvenience however they have this modem completely locked down. They dont allow you to have access to change any of the settings whether that be setting automatic resets or port forwarding.

So Consolidated Communications is going to recieve a 1 star from me. The service itself is horrible and the customer service is completley useless unless you don't know how to plug a cable into a wall. I would stick to tethering from your phone its faster and more reliable...

TLDR: Consolidated has horrible internet service and offers you no other alternative plan. You can pay more but it will do nothing. Unless you only check emails and like to watch less than HD video with the occasional buffer this Internet is not for you.

P.S. To those who choose to disregard this review, please consider paying for one of Consolidateds cheaper plans as paying more will only get them more revenue and barely add any benefit to you. As someone who likes to push internet service to its limits the Trade Off is most definitley not a fair one.< /text>< rating>

Roseville Telephone Co. Was the original phone co. Started by Bob Doyle.  He'd roll over in his grave if he knew the company merged with a sloppy company.  In 2002-2003, Roseville Telco CHANGED the name to SureWest in order to brand the products as mainstream rather than the old fashioned POTS phone lines.
My experience with Consolidated is that when I called to get my service xfered, the customer service rep said "oh good, we don't service that part of Roseville!  Thanks, bye ((click))".  She was very upbeat and Relieved about not having to xfer service!  I know that most of the original employees are gone, you don't get the same good customer service you used to.  I just called their number while they're closed: Instead of saying they're closed and giving the hours of operation, they make you go thru a phone tree.  Once you get to the dep't you want, the recording says "please leave a voicemail or call back later."  How rude!  Why should someone go thru all that trouble just to be told to leave. VM, and for Whom??  Not impressed at all with their company.<//Text>

<response>None<//response><pics>None<//pics><Text>I was an original Surewest customer when Consolidated Communications absorbed Surewest into their company. I recommended Surewest to my room mates because I had them for my internet service in the past. My room mates and I were happy with the quality of service we received prior to the merger.

Sadly, the merger had a negative effect on quality. Due to difficulties with accessing programs, we dropped television service and went with DISH. I rarely watch television so I was minimally effected by this change.

Prior to the merger, we had no internet issues. Afterwards, the problems were non stop ranging from long wait times to access online websites, intermittent stability (streaming would disconnect), etc.

The straw that broke the camels back was when I had to move and discovered I had an early termination fee on a contract that they either auto enrolled me in or presented to me as if it was a service call paperwork.

In conclusion, the services Consolidated Communications offers are a dime a dozen so I would recommend someone else that is hungry for your business, give you better quality, and won't do sneaky things to retain your business.<//Text>< Date>

<review>I am turning in my internet connection equipment today because it quit working ast week and no one seemed to be able to fix it. After 7 days of no internet or phone call telling me they've fixed the problem, I've decided to terminate my internet and just have a landline.....I have a Verizon jetpack which works just fine.  supposedly I had a fix it ticket open but no response from them.</review></record></dataset><record>

This company is amazing, positively no complaints and we're pretty particular people if we're honest. We had the canopy within 10 days from our order. Each person we dealt with at the company was great. No complaints! Don't bother looking elsewhere. The price was right, service was right! A win! (Photos don't show it all the way up) Thank you!<//Text>

Very happy with my tent (10 x10) . I use it to set up a different locations to do windshield repair. I have two different canopy tops with my logo on it and a blue frame. Once you get the hang of it it's easy to set up and tear down. Everyone at extreme canopy that I dealt with was pleasant and helpful from the salesman to the graphic designer to the owner. Good company that makes quality products.</Text>

The online experience was great. Designing my custom canopy was seamless. They shipped my frame quickly. The only reason this is not a 5 star is because the shipped my custom top to a different address. It was not till months later when I followed up on why I had never gotten my custom top did anyone realize what had happened. They did print me a new one and mailed it over free of charge. So there is a nice ending to this story. I am just glad I did not have an event in the near future to where this mishap would have prevented the canopy on being here on time.< /review>

<Text>We needed a canopy for an outdoor event but had very short notice.

The folks at Extreme Canopy were great! Very helpful phone support, their graphics people took our artwork, made a 4 sided custom canopy and delivered from California to Florida in time for our event.  Actually 2 days earlier than expected.  So we had time to set it up beforehand so that all went smooth at the event.  We went with the X6 frame because we wanted something that was sturdy enough for windy weather.  We were very impressed with the quality and durability.  It is heavier than most of the other frames I've seen but this one will not be folding up when the breeze picks up.  Its a very sturdy frame.  Couldn't be happier.

Thanks to all the team at Extreme Canopy for helping to make our event a success!<//Text><gmapID>0x80dd27abe8516551:0x1ae52c2f3f6bd110</gmapID></record>

I looked at several different canopy manufacturers and bought what amounted to junk twice. Then I spoke with another agency that purchased their canopy from Extreme Canopy. Ultimately, I purchased two canopies from EC: a 10x10 and a 10x20. The workmanship is truly impressive - these things will last a long time! Another thing I feel compelled to mention is that the artwork they did was far and above what I expected. Our agency logo is crisp and clear with vibrant colors. If you're looking for durable, easy-to-setup canopies, Extreme Canopy is the place to shop.< /Text>

<Text>4.8 Stars. I have the X6 and it is the best canopy I've seen or used. About the only thing I found a little lacking was the wheel mounts on the wheeled protective cover. 1 or 2 large fender washers on each side was all that was needed to keep the wheels from contacting the fabric.< /Text>< Time>

I appreciate the durability of this canopy. Commercial quality.   I had a problem with the roof dripping ever so slightly. I sell “letterpress printed” paper products and could not have water dripping.  Buy one or two sizes bigger. 10x 10 just isn’t big enough for you, your displays and people looking if it rains.<//Review>

Great investment! I stumbled onto this company and had such a great experience in the ordering. Cody contacted me, and explained the process. The design team took my thoughts and made a better looking tent than I originally asked for. We made a small modification due to my wife's marketing mind. We had a few small hiccups but the owner Josh called me and cleared my misunderstanding up, and order being late.

Upon receiving my tent my sales began to grow immediately. Everyone was attracted to the words I printed on the valance. I want to emphasize on my experience, and investment. I spent $1050 on a tent that came with the bag. Yesterday alone I did an event for $1350. Previously I was just doing farmers markets preparing for this moment. Thanks to the tent, the first day I used it was when the company approached me about serving their 250 employee shift.

Again great investment! Pays for itself.</text>

Best Canopy I ever bought! The team at Extreme Canopy came up with the design and we love it! We get amazing comments when people see it. I've been in the rag trade all my life and can vouch for the  high quality of craftsmanship in the sewing. One very happy customer! 5 star all the way! Thanks again  your team. Barry<//text>

I sent an email on Sunday night figuring they would get back to me on Monday afternoon or Tuesday some time. to my surprise Cody called me (not emailed me) at 8:30 am there time. there customer support is top notch!  Cody was able to answer my shipping questions and get my order in and shipped that day. my canopy arrived in Minnesota on Friday. there packaging is very good. double boxed heavy double wall boxes to prevent damages. the canopy itself is like its name. EXTREME!
The customer support i got from Cody was excellent. all my emails were answered with in minutes. this company has its ducks in a row!!! cant go wrong buying one of there products!!!!</Text>

<Text>I am very happy with the pop up tents I have received from Extreme Canopy.  From the great initial customer service to the fantastic service in graphics and logistics, the staff at Extreme Canopy were always very kind and helpful. I wanted sturdy, heavy-duty aluminum canopies that will last many years, and the canopy I received ticked all the boxes - at an affordable price too! Extreme Canopy definitely exceeded all of my exceptions. It was also a fantastic bonus that they offer free shipping US wide. Extreme Canopy is by far the best canopy business.<//Text>< Rating>

I placed the order through the website. I never spoke to anyone. Didn’t need to. Necessary communication took place via email. I uploaded the artwork. Everything went perfectly with the product ordered. The 10x15 frame and canopy are of excellent quality. I highly recommend this company. I am very satisfied with the product.</Review>

<review>We ordered a pair of 10x20 pop-up canopy tents from Extreme Canopy, one X5 stock and one X7 with a custom roof and valence design.  Customer service through the ordering and design process was very prompt and professional.  The stock components were shipped the next day and our custom design top arrived as promised about 2 weeks after artwork was approved.  The quality of the top materials and artwork, both colors and resolution, is simply amazing!  We're just starting to use the tents in a college workshop, so far the quality and ease of use has been superior to our previous tents.< /review><username>Christopher Gordon</username><Date>1580847497551< /Date><rating>5<//rating>< userid>

<Text>The quality of the stretch table cover is great! The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was communication. It took over a week to receive my mock up design (my logo in 3 places on a table cover), which I only received after asking again (& received within minutes of asking, so response was great). I had to again inquire a week later about progress. I had shared that I needed it ASAP. I don’t know how long I would have waited if I never reached out, but I am very happy with the end result. I would order from Extreme Canopy again, but only if I had a month before I needed the product.</Text>< Pictures>

Let me first start out by saying, I have not been the easiest of clients to work with. Our designs have been changed, items have been added, items have been removed, logos have been altered, colors have been enhanced and the team at Extreme Canopy has been happy to help me every step of the way. I can’t thank them them enough for all of the effort that has been put into creating exactly what I had envisioned our trade show and symposium set ups. Robert in sales has been a pleasure to work with and has put a lot of effort into getting me exactly what our company needs to stand out above the the rest at any show we go too. We will absolutely continue to send all of our needs to Extreme Canopy and I can be confident that I will be pleased with the outcome. Thank you so much to the entire team at Extreme Canopy. You guys are second to none!!👊🏼</review>

Product pricing, artwork comps and communication before the order went as planned. The frame/hardware for the tent arrived promptly, but the canopy did not arrive in time to make my event. There was some communication with the logistics person, who was pleasant enough but they didn't seem to have much communication/control with the overseas production or shipping which left us with no expediting options. 7-10 business days ended up being 14 days for me...not terrible, but I missed my event. On the flip side, I am satisfied with the quality of the frame, hardware and canopy. Also to note, when I expressed my concerns to the company, they did offer me an unspecified discount on my next order.<//Review>

We needed a good, sturdy attractive canopy for our Kids Camp activity’s at the Lemoore Seventh Day Adventist Church. The staff at Extreme Canopy was so helpful in designing and coordinating our colors. It is everything we were looking for and more.
We get nothing but complements on what a great looking, well built canopy.
We are so pleased and I highly recommended this company and their canopy’s!<//review>

<review>I want to thank all the people at Extreme Canopy for a great product and fantastic customer service! We were tired of the flimsy products available in local retail stores. Our research led us to Extreme where we found the right canopy for our needs. When it was delivered, we were quite impressed with strength of both the frame and cover. Very high quality. We knew we made the right decision and the first wind storm we experienced with our 10x10 - X7 confirmed we would not be disappointed!
A special thanks to Cody for addressing our needs and making sure we had the right product. Customer service the way it should be! Thank you all.

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Definitely the most high quality canopy I have owned. This is not your typical store bought flimsy canopy. It's extremely sturdy, sets up quickly, and looks AMAZING. They customized with a logo perfectly and we get multiple compliments every single event we set it up for. It has kept us dry in downpours and kept the heat of the sun off of us like no other canopy ever has.  Aftera year of using it in every weather conditions possible, it is still in perfect condition. I will say that it is heavy when stored in the case but not to the point that it isn't manageable. I just have to plan ahead to have help getting it where I need to. I already have plans to purchase another one as soon as my budget allows!<//Text>< user_id>

<Text>My canopy is awesome. We use it mainly for camping. The frame is very solid. The canopy is thick and durable. I asked what a replacement canopy costs (since they all wear out over time) and it was reasonable. I like the spring-tension center tarp support poles. That makes a big difference. As all tarps stretch over time, the spring will keep the tarp taught.</Text>< pics>

My experience was decent with Extreme Canopy. I got a strong reliable tent like I hoped for. My only issues were with the shipping. Because of the weight of some of the items one box was misplaced and I had to wait an extra week or 2 for it to come. I would buy from them again though. I bought a commercial grade 10x10. I do commercial auto painting outdoors and the tent has been though some rough conditions.  It is still holding up well after 6 months of rough winds, rain, sun and beatings.< /text>

This is an excellent canopy but you will need at least two people to set it up and break it down. I was using the canopy at the top of Mt Greylock in MA when an unexpected summer storm hit. There were strong winds and intense rain but the canopy stood up well and protected some expensive electronic gear that was under the canopy. This is a very solid unit and I highly recommend it.</text>

I don’t normally write reviews but I was so impressed with these guys, I had to let others know.
First, we had a tight timeframe for an event and they worked with us to get it to us in a week!
Second, we had an idea of what we wanted for a design, which they made proofs for.  But then they came in with a second option that looked so eye catching that we ended up going with.  It was better than I could have thought up myself.  Most companies just design what you ask for, but they went over and above to design something we LOVE.
Last but not least, the quality is amazing.  We went with the highest quality 10x10, which was a great size but also, at windy events, everyone comments on the quality of our tent bc it looks solid, not blowing over and has a quality frame.  It is heavy but so worth it!
Great job Extreme Canopy!  Thank you!</review><gmapID>0x80dd27abe8516551:0x1ae52c2f3f6bd110< /gmapID><user_name>Cooperman< /user_name>< Rate>

Excellent service. There was a minor problem with one of the supports  when the canopy arrived and the company responded and fixed it immediately.  Because the canopy is sturdily built it is heavier than most, but the wheeled container the canopy is packed in makes it easuy to handle.< /review>

VERY DURABLE WELL MADE PRODUCT.
Houseboating at lake Powell we had Canopies set up with side walls,
one an Extreme Canopy and wall system, and the other an upgraded so-called commercial on.
After 3 days or good afternoon winds, the Extreme Canopy was untouched, and the other needed the walls removed and canopy restated.</Review><user_id>101606553645476204906</user_id>< Date>

<Text>I had been comparing tents in stores, online, and I would check our other vendor tents at festivals we attended. NOTHING fit our needs and no one was as informative as Robert, our sales rep!!!. I saw this tent at a festival in Oct. 2018 and fell in love. I called immediately and talked to Robert who walked me through all my questions to make sure I got the right tent. The next event was the end of Nov. and our custom logo tent was complete. I can't express how happy with our tent and our look. All thanks to Robert and Extreme Canopy!< /Text>< gmap_id>

Simply the perfect company to do business with!  Professional, courteous, quick to action. I ordered a 10 x 20 canopy with a custom cover for my son's college cross country team (Go Fairfield Stags!).  Order was place on a Monday, art design submitted and edited by their staff of designers, and it was in the mail (FedEx) to me by....the end of the day!  Received on Friday, for Saturday's meet! Not a single local (I actually have a friend in the business and he told me he couldn't come anywhere near the price) or other google searched vendor could come anywhere close to their price point. Flawless execution and a shout out to Robert and Charina for all of their help!</text>

<review>After a nasty storm blew through our local lake front festival, with high winds and sideways rain, my Extreme Canopy was the only tent booth with zero damage. Most were completely destroyed. I highly recommend these canopies. I don't think you can buy a better one.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Appreciate everyones efforts for getting my custom canopy to me on time for my event. A special thanks to Elise in graphics who was patient with someone not use to dealing with artwork files. The canopy looks great and survived a storm that many others didn't. I can't recommend the team at Extreme Canopy more highly and love the quality!<//Text>

Truly the most reliable, heavy duty, aesthetic built canopy that we have ever purchased in 20 years of having canopies. The gauge of the aluminum is "ballistic" quality. The ease of opening and closing is unlike no other I have seen. Early on we would purchase the Walmart Type canopies and learned our lesson many times over by replacing. The cost of this canopy is so fairly priced and we have seen our return on our investment by not having to replace in years!! The service is exceptional also. You speak directly to the makers of the canopy. Made in USA also.
I can only say great things about Extreme Canopy.. Above and Beyond my expectations in all!!< /review>

I ordered a tent and it arrived promptly.  However, the small plastic piece was shattered.  It wasn't worth shipping it back but I did mention it to the company and they went to extraordinary lengths to make it right.  This is what I call customer service in the era of no customer service.</review>

<text>Horrible communication.  Failed to inform me product would not be delivered by deadline.  No accountability from anyone within the company.  If you need something and have a deadline, do not use this company.  Cannot comment on product quality as we do not have the canopy we purchased.<//text><user>100387100616125937888<//user></record></dataset><record>

I can honestly attest that Extreme Canopy is that company. No need to fear buying online, this company is professional, honest and we trust them and love the 8 tents we purchased from them.  I am writing this as an after the sale support type of review. the purchase was smooth but the after support was very impressive.

You do not need to look elsewhere or worry about saving a penny , this company is the real deal.< /text>< rate>

No,  you won't find the vast selection of house junk carried by Home Depot but this is the place for lumber.  Very helpful and friendly staff,  higher quality lumber,  and prices only slightly more than the mega store down the street.  I should have come here first...< /Review>

I Prefer Going To Builder's Supply Than Big Box Stores.  I'm Treated Much Better At Builder's Supply.  Their Stock isn't as large as the big box stores.  But Builder's Supply Store,  have many other items that big box stores don't.  Thank You To Parker Lumber Builders Supply Store Yucca Valley<//review>

Poor customer service. I arrived right at closing time. The employee lock the door ias I approached and refused to acknowledge me or answer the phone when I tried to call. She didn't need to open after she closed the door but she could have treated me like a human and at least told me when they opened again.</Review>

Love this store !  Employees are so nice, friendly and knowledgeable.  They have tons of things you can't find at the big box store.  I always leave there with what I need and a smile on my face...shopping like in the good ole days. Thank you Parker Hardware !< /text>

Bottom line one saves 15-20% same products, did price checking over Home Depot's over inflated pricing, smaller and better service also. May add HD's lumber looks like it came from a used construction site.<//review>< Rating>

<text>Took 2 chainsaws in for repair/cleaning and both had missing parts that needed replacement. After 5 weeks only 1 had been tuned up. They didn't replace the missing parts or clean them internally.  I stopped in several times during the 5 week period and tech said he kept forgetting to work on them or order parts. Such a disappointment.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I would recommend them to everyone.  They have things you cannot find
anywhere else, and they are very helpful.
Thank you.<//text>

<review>better that home depot.  I walk in there someone always comes up to me and directs me to the right place.  With Barr you do not have to buy a huge package to finish up an electrical job.  I when to Home Depot and they only had large packages of electrical items.  I always get greated by someone and always asked if I found everything ok.  The last time I when in and told them that I could not find the item, another employee when to the isle and grabbed it for me.  That is customer service!< /review><Resp>None< /Resp>< date>

I was very impressed with the quick a/c repair  that the owner Luis did. I'm a nurse and needed it fixed in a hurry. The owner fixed it and for a good price. Really liked the work that was done. Thank you</review>

This is a small and clean restaurant with really good food and nice customer service.  Everything (fried rice with shaken beef, porridge, beef stew and avocado shake) we had was good...hot and tasty.  I've been coming here over the last 10 years and the quality has been consistent.  Because it's on Bolsa Ave, the traffic and parking can be very frustrating...just fyi.<//review>

I had the noodle soup and it was just NOT good. The fish in my soup was very under cooked. I had to take Pepto bismo right after eating that small piece to prevent any stomach problem.  I hate to waste money on food like this. Customer service was nah as well. Not sure why they don't thank their customers either.< /Text>

The menu selection is great and never had a problem with anything I've ordered here for the past 10 years.   Favorite dishes is their porridge,  bot chien,  wonton noodle soup & banh canh tom cua (shrimp and crab udon soup).   My favorite drinks is passion fruit with the perfect tang and sweetness and the  dau xanh la dua (mung bean with  pandon)< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<rating>5<//rating><text>When it's chilly and rainy out and you're feeling a bit "under the weather" - Vietnamese rice porridge (chao) is probably one of the best comfort foods you can get in the area. Chao is as warm and comforting as American "chicken noodle soup". It is easy to eat, easy to garnish with a variety of different meat options and filling.

I'll typically phone in my order and pick up rather than eat inside, although I definitely like their renovations as there is a lot more space to eat vs. how the interior used to look like when they first opened (a few picnic tables and plastic chairs).

My favorite to order here is the Chao Bo Bam + Century Egg (Beef rice porridge). I always ask for extra ginger since it helps clear up the sinuses/nasal passages. Since I typically come in the evening, there isn't anymore fresh chinese doughnuts - but if you have a chance, definitely order some to dip in your porridge.

Parking is a nightmare as usual (as it is Little Saigon) - but go at night near closing time and there is plenty of parking.

Cash only - I believe they take CC as well but with a hefty minimum ($20 or something like that - so mostly for their cake orders). Prices here are reasonable and have not increased much due to inflation.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dd27b5e9afa06b:0xbf8e8f44f7496881<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>When my ordered meals came out, they were cold and it was very disappointing. When I left two of my meals there, they did nothing to apologize for how cold it was. All together with 4 orders and 2 banh bo mong co, was much too pricey for meals that were very disappointing and workers who weren't considerate enough to apologize to their customers for their mistakes.< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Today 16/10/2018 here to call two bowls of fish porridge as many times come here to eat. But today the porridge was too salty when I first brought it out and after squeezing the lemon into it, it was still salty, so I asked for two more slices of lemon, I told the waiter why the porridge was salty, but they were awake to let me squeeze more lemon. As a result, after squeezing more lemon, porridge was both salty and sour, so I ate a few pieces of fish and then stood up to pay the bill. She asked if she was so salty, sorry and charged with the correct price of more than $ 18.00. Losing money hungry, I think trading if there is a mistake, how to make customers happy again because I am an old customer.

Hôm nay 16/10/2018 ghé đây kêu hai tô cháo cá như nhiều lần đến đây ăn. Nhưng hôm nay cháo mặn quá khi mới đem ra và sau khi vắt chanh vào vẫn còn mặn nên xin thêm hai miếng chanh mình nói với người phục vụ lý do cháo mặn nhưng họ tỉnh bơ để mình vắt thêm chanh. Kết quả là sau khi vắt thêm chanh cháo vừa mặn vừa chua nên ăn đỡ mấy miếng cá rồi đứng lên tính tiền. Cô tính tiền hỏi bộ mặn lắm hả xin lỗi nghen và tính đúng giá tiền hơn $18.00. Mất tiền bụng đói mình nghĩ buôn bán nếu có mistake thì phải làm thế nào để khách hàng còn vui vẻ trở lại vì mình là khách cũ.< /Review>

I love all about the experience I had at the Riviera Theatre! The friendly staff, the local candy, olive oil popcorn, the wide and comfortable seats with room to stretch your legs, and most of all the great movie selection! Plus, they have the best Dolby Vision/Sound system I have ever experienced!< /text>

<Review>A very nice movie house and great for date nights! I've been there several times and haven't had any terrible issues. The food was great, the staff was very pleasant, and the service was great! The prices are fair, so if you are want to watch a movie while you eat a meal, then check this place out. We will be back!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>Best movie house in Santa Barbara. Good programming, with lots of independent and foreign films. Historic location, recently renovated. Reasonably comfortable seating, good acoustics. Sparsely attended. I don't know what's wrong with people. I'd much rather see a film on the big screen than do Netflix at home.</review>< pictures>

Good theater experience, we saw Linda Ronstadt's The Voice - Fantastic Movie must see!  Nice soft chairs good for the back; parking needs better instruction. There is a lower parking lot and an upper.  I guess I will know better next time - Disabled, I got stuck in the lower parking lot and had to walk with a cane to where there was handicapped parking in the upper lot.</review>

Hidden away in the hills of Santa Barbara, the Riviera theater is an amazing treasure. Recently renovated with comfortable seats, climate control, digital presentation, and a great sound system this is one of the best places to see a film ever!</review>

I've NEVER had a Movie Pass card declined ever before anywhere except here. The clerk swiped it & almost immediately said declined and said, "Try signing in again" as if she knew how it works (you cannot do it twice)..nonetheless I walked away, checked my phone for any signs of errors, & then went back, & the same clerk took my card & almost immediately handed it back ...it was so fast I had a difficult time believing she actually swiped it. And she said declined. So I paid out of pocket.  she looked surprised that I had a credit card as if I was so poor. the ONLY time this ever happened. PLUS, it also worked successfully HERE the day before (different clerk). Maybe Santa Barbara localism ?</review>

A classic theater made anew and now dedicated to the highest quality films from talkies to the contemporary. Visiting the campus on which it sets is a real treat and the view of Santa Barbara and the ocean is a glimpse of Heaven.<//Text>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>Sunday, January 6th 2013 at The Riviera, and we're watching the 7 pm showing of Les Mis.  Just as the scene at the barricades reached its climax, the sound went out, and, after some minutes, it appeared that there was nobody in the projection booth.  An audience member had to go find somebody.  Eventually the sound came on, but by then the scene was pretty much over.  No explanation was given as we left, and no apology was offered.  It somewhat spoiled our enjoyment of the movie.  Do better, guys!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Hostile employees, rude from the start. Also you're not allowed to make your own sandwich. Big no no on the subway tradition! I would recommend driving to the one down Rio ranch road it's only 3 minutes away and has good service.<//Text>

This is a smaller Subway on the corner of a mini plaza, so this place offers the basics of what Subway has to offer. There is no restroom so you would have to go somewhere else to find one.<//Text>

<Text>I've been coming to this subway for convenience purposes, but after today I'm done! I'd rather drive a couple miles out... Employees Amelia and Alma (and that other lady with the eyeliner) really have bad attitudes! My sandwich was falling apart and stuff spilled everywhere when I opened it. I wish I could post a picture. Besides the fact that they're sloppy they're rude! Didn't get some ingredients in my sandwich and when I later asked for it because she forgot to add I'm told I didn't tell her.... By a different employee. SMH</Text>< Time>

Staff very unfriendly no greeting no smile
They are a clean resturant food taste fine. Mgmt needs to talk to their staff and train them how to treat customers professionally. Lets not forget their food isnt free. We deserve to be acknowledged greeted not asking for too much. I ve been going to subways for awhile this one seems to be the most unfriendly.<//review>

This thing is super durable it lasted through a heavy very intensive Halestorm. This thing is definitely worth every dollar spent.

I really like the life-like fish windsocks. They look like they swim in the air! My favorite kites were the pirate ship kite, Blue Angel plane kite, and pro-spinner kite. I remembered when Shaq bought a kite on his visit to SF.  Enjoy the store as I have as a local.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808580f9b38c1c99:0xe441fae6195e0c89< /GmapID></record>

Yes the kites are fantastic I recommend the foil kite they're little expensive at $79 but you know what it's only a kite I had a great time and all my friends that I was really original taking my date on a kite flying trip it was cool highly recommended get the big tights though the big ones are the best ones we always like the really big ones< /text>

However, take a left and go to the back of the store. There is a good stock of "stunt" kites. What especially impressed me was that they had several of the HQ and Prism two line foils hanging so that you can see what they look like, how big they are, etc.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><userid>117583817906618576176<//userid>< response>

<Text>(Translated by Google) This shop sells souvenirs such as key chains, fridge magnets, etc. I was surprised to find a keychain that was written in Made in California. There are also stones that are unique besides kites, of course. Staff is friendly and helpful. I go back and forth to this place.

Toko ini menjual souvenir seperti gantungan kunci, magnet kulkas, etc. Saya surprise menemukan keychain yang bertuliskan Made in California. Disini juga ada batu-batu yang unik selain layang-layang tentu saja. Staff ramah dan membantu. Saya bolak balik ke tempat ini.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEXJEg8FZGWTGMqMW3ABR50BRXGkWX9nTW23dn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFGqUjvzwpvXSUqA-O0u-J0xF13u2JsQXUgHdH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUbAkn9tsk0-_P6bfS748qeutUSrDba4h3lVUs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNj0MGd6qEF0lvc3j2YcGVYJ9Gld9K4huZCbAWY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_2CicdJNBMQZkHvqmeqLyrom9ZgI6H3vzo7ov=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_rEM9E1qli3LAp3JRhIjOVmy86cViNJP1XUHF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<date>1550664766390< /date><rate>4< /rate><Review>(Translated by Google) A particularly colorful shop at Pier 39 in San Francisco.
I immediately state that a kite expert would never come here to buy a real efficient kite. This shop offers a wide variety of toy kites of all shapes and sizes, good for kids, and many fabric items, weather vane, embellishments, etc ...
However it is a pleasant store to visit and where to buy some toy or some souvenir to take home.

(Original)
Negozio particolarmente colorato al Pier 39 di San Francisco.
Premetto subito che un esperto di aquiloni non verrebbe mai qui per acquistare un vero aquilone di buona efficienza. Questo negozio propone una ampia varietà di aquiloni giocattolo di ogni forma e dimensione, buoni per i ragazzini, e tanti articoli in stoffa, segnavento, abbellimenti, ecc...
Comunque si tratta di un negozio gradevole da visitare e dove acquistare qualche giocattolo o qualche ricordo da portare a casa.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>Have always liked Krispy Kreme donuts and never had an issue with their festive ways however just last night as we stopped for donuts and coffee we had no choice but to buy the green mossy looking donuts in honor of some Patrick guy. These donuts look ill and weird and some are all beat up. The reps are usually  friendly so that is not a problem however this green donuts situation is not beneficial 🤢 Update on these donuts...We now have food poisoning !!!<//Text>< pictures>

Service wasn't great,  the girl working the register probably was having a bad day so she wasn't as friendly as I'm used to.  And aside from that, I felt rushed to pick a donut.<//review>

<rate>2<//rate><text>Disappointed. It was my first time there. The "hot now" sign was lit so the web site said we were to get a dozen for just $5. Didn't happen, they charged full price anyway. When there my wife asked an employee a question 3 times, ignored all 3 times. A employee passing behind that employee then answered instead.< /text></record></dataset><record>

People dont listen ..they are super busy so I know they cant regulate like they shouls bc,people cant read sign clearly says if more than 7 people in don't come in. When I got there it was a line outside of about 4 people in front of me. By the time I got to go inside everyone behind me had stopped reading and by the time I left it was 11 people in there! I wish from time to time they would regulate. Otherwise very friendly staff and good service</Text>

The hot light was on and they certainly weren't as fresh as I've had in the past nothing is better than a fresh warm melt in your mouth original Krispy Kreme donut. Frozen lemonade is a bit sour though.<//review>

<Text>I love Krispy Kreme. You can never go wrong with getting a donut. Who says you have to be hungry to get a donut?! :) The service is great. They are nice and friendly there. Parking is so so but I always find one when I get there. It’s an easy place to find and
I’ll definitely visit again when I’m in town.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c259bd1a0fbea7:0xac818dc68b7ab30a</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

New manager Joseph is wonderful.  So glad he is there now. I used to be a great customer but the last crew was pretty rude especially some of the management.  Original donuts hot and fresh is still my favorite.</text>

I used to live by a big Krispy Kreme shop where they had a factory type spillage of these in the large window as you walked in. It was cool to see and added something to the atmosphere. The warm doughnuts created all day were such a pleasure and I grew up eating this band, so I sometimes crave these things for that nostalgic feeling it would often bring.
I just gave four because the coffee when I went was average and I love a more quality coffee because I lived in Hawaii for a very long time.</review>

There's all of that and I had recently went through for 2 dozen, and the second box was completely wrong for what I had asked.

<review>Generally speaking, the customer service at this location is usually very good. The quality of the donuts is very consistent with the corporate quality I've experienced across other locations. Occasionally, they do run out of specialty donuts fairly early in the day. So if you are looking for something that is on special, get there early in the day.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

To tell the truth it is hard to bring home a 12 when I brought 12. So, I have to buy more, so I can get 12 home.<//Review>

For someone who doesn't like donuts Krispy Kreme actually made me like them a lot. I used to vomit when I ate donuts I hesitated eating their donuts but im glad I did for I love them. My favorite ones are the Raspberry fill Donuts❤❤< /Review>

<Text>I am very disappointed in this location. To start, there was no open register inside. The drive thru man was handling both the cars and the walk ins. Secondly, the seasonal doughnuts were not available. The only indication they existed was the posters on display. Finally, all our coffees tasted the same. All of them. Not only did they not have the new spice coffee, all our orders tasted like a regular coffee. My hazelnut coffee tasted like my husband's vanilla coffee tasted like mine, and my son's hot chocolate tasted like coffee. Two stars because the doughnuts were alright and I understand it wasn't the drive thru guy's fault. But it was very disappointing.<//Text><rate>2<//rate><Name>Norma Aguirre<//Name><resp>None<//resp><Pictures>None</Pictures><Time>1575224985425</Time><gmapID>0x80c259bd1a0fbea7:0xac818dc68b7ab30a</gmapID><user_id>115989254722705498178< /user_id></record>

The donuts are always good but, the customer service here is great! I took my sons and neices there this weekend. Christine took the time to talk to all the kids and make them feel super special, along with another associate Paris. This made our donut trip really special. The kids really enjoyed it!</text>

Wow so many donuts. I got several dozen donuts and they have them all ready to go so there was very little wait time. Regular glazed donuts are $10.99 a dozen and the mixed (filled sprinkles etc.) are $11.99 a dozen. More expensive than other donut places but everyone LOVEs these donuts!! The location is easy to see from the street and easy to get in and out of. Also has a drive thru!<//Text>

<review>Been there 3 times back to back about the same time in the afternoon when the light is on sometimes the wife goes the next day still can't get any raspberry cream dough nuts
If the sales are that good it would make sense to
Make more. One time one of the guys work there
Made us some while we waited. The wife and I really appreciated what he done but we could never catch him there again after that nite.
He was the only one who ever considered during
That good deed for a customer.
Probably won't be going back as much as I use to it's to far for mr to drive to be disappointed.<//review>< Pictures>

I went to try the Reese's doughnut. Simply delicious, and the filling was amazing. Good selection, clean, and decent customer service. Only complaint is the hazelnut iced latte I got didn't have any flavor. Note fresh doughnuts are from 5 AM to 10 AM. Don't come midday expecting fresh doughnuts (lol). Drive thru is open 24 hours.</text>

I just don't get it. Tiny, expensive donuts, slow service, and an unusual almost stiff texture to the glaze donuts... They get points for the drive thru, that's genius and the only reason to ever go there, and the blueberry fritter smells like heaven even though it's so intensely sweet it should be dispensed with an insulin shot. I never knew a donut could be TOO sweet, but Krispy Kreme managed it. I guess it's just one of those places you have to check out, but just across the parking lot behind them is a local nobody shop that sells amazing, giant fluffy donuts and muffins for half the price.< /Review>

<Review>Came in to this store during the Halloween season. Had some delicious halloween themed donuts. Customer service was good, product was good, the selection could have been better as in more themed donuts, but that's minimal. Great product at a great price...definitely better than a 5 dollar cupcake across the street!< /Review><gmapID>0x80c259bd1a0fbea7:0xac818dc68b7ab30a<//gmapID></record>

Nothing really bad to say about this place, everyone seems to do their job quite efficiently, the lines move very fast through the drive-thru and in store. The staff is very friendly and nice , and the donuts are amazing as they should be! Everything is kept clean and there is a nice outdoor seating area. Plus there open pretty late.<//Review>

It's a Krispy Kreme, what more could you want? It's easy to get into and out of, and the selection is good. The staff is nice, and they have fast service. You won't be disappointed.<//Text>

Second try here in Palmdale, but this time they are in a smaller price of real estate which will save them this time.

Your typical sweet donuts, something for the wife and kids, but but me. Customer service is great! However, needs better parking arrangements.<//Review>

I love maple covered Krispy Kreme donuts and this place has them. Service is good. But I'm not really happy with their salted caramel coffee. There is a drive thru and a small eating area inside and more seats outside. I just wish these donuts weren't so fattening.<//review>

Cool place. They was running a deal today that's why the establishment was not clean.  There was at least a 2 hour wait because of the advertised deal of a dozen donuts for $.80 .< /review>

I remember when they use to offer you a glazed donut while you waited in line  (no more) so you ask for a assorted dozen and they still charge you an extra 20 cents for a sprinkle one. Next time my corner donut shop.<//Review>

Their donuts are amazing and the occasional free donut for Krispy Kreme rewards members just adds to the sweetness :)<//Text>

If you've seen one Krispy Kreme you've seen them all. I only like the original glazed donuts. They melt in your mouth. Other donut selection are mediocre.< /Review>

I don't know if it's because they have the best job in the world working with these beautiful doughnuts all day but they sure made my day.  The doughnuts were always fresh and delicious.  I would highly recommend if you are in the area to stop by and pick up a dozen of freshly baked doughnuts and try to not eat one on your way home, if you don't you're missing out on one of life's small pleasures.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Visited this location on 4/29/2017 around 5:30 PM and was told they don't have any glazed donuts available.  It's like KFC running out of chicken.  This was the second I walked out of this joint without donuts, pretty sad.< /Review>< Time>

I went today for the specialty eclipse doughnuts and they ran out of the item. Today is my birthday and I called ahead of time for this item. How do run out of something that is a promotional product? Its the only Krispies Kreme in Palmdale CA or in the whole Antelope Valley. To say the least I am very disappointed and I hope no one else has this type of experience. It would be better if they ran out of every other doughnut but don't run out of the promotional product. Yeah some eclipse!< /Text>

<username>Jesse Taska< /username><review>The worst one I have ever been to. Anytime that the sign is on as "hot" they are never hot. I don't think they understand what that sign is supposed to mean. Any Krispy Kreme in the south would shake there head at the nonsense from the one out here. Very disappointed.< /review>< rating>

<review>I was told to come back after 2 for a certain doughnut. I showed at 2:15, and I was told another 10 mins. After 25 mire mins it still wasn't ready. Everyone in there knew what I was there for, yet all the employees ignored me. I told them the first time I came in how far I drove to get this particular doughnut. I was assured it would be ready by 2 pm by 2:45 I had to leave. I couldn't wait any longer.  They need better time management skills and be honest to their customers.<//review>< Pics>

Try to stop in whenever we pass by, I get a hot dozen eat half on the spot and save the other half for my breakfast the next morning, and no im not fat, and no I dont sit on my butt all day either, so I eat what I want. Never get that heavy donut oil brick in the stomach feeling like I get from any other donuts, Krispy Kreme's are always light sweet and wispy, just melt in my mouth sugar delights. Dang gona have to get more now after talking about them, cant wait.<//Review>< username>
