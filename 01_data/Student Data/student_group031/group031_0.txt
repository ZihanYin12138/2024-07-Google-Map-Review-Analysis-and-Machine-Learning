<date>1622422157547<//date><Text>By far my worst experience at any cold stone. Upon entering the store I was asked for a vaccination card to make sure I was vaccinated, this is against all HIPPA laws as they are not a medical provider and are not entitled to my medical information. Beyond that, that bigger girl working was clearly not wearing deodorant and the stench was easily noticeable upon entering the store. Get your employees in check Cold Stone! Just general Hygiene is pretty simple... never coming back to this store.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80dbfa0ea9277e4f:0x82f52c940f11e6db</Gmap_id></record>

<text>This Cold stone not only gave me super melted ice cream and didn’t taste like the flavor but also proceeded to ask for our medical information just so that we didn’t have to wear masks. I am very disappointed and probably will never visit a cold stone again. That is totally against hippa laws to ask to see my medical information.<//text><user>115761376277310315160< /user>< Pictures>

<Text>I have been a customer of this location since it first opened 10+ years ago.  I have never had a bad experience, everyone is always so friendly and accommodating.  The ice cream is delicious.  The only thing I miss is having the outside tables and chairs which were taken away a year or so ago when Target expanded.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
We were really disappointed with the staff. We tried making an order online and it wasnt going through, so we called to place a pickup order for a Mario cake. The website said it was an 8” cake so we said we wanted the 8” Mario cake. The young man didnt know what cake was 8” and didnt give us any way to find out. He continually insisted we order online even though we told him is wasnt working. So finally we figured which cake was which and placed the order. All of this could be overlooked but he somehow got the wrong cake ordered. This was a gift for a friend in a time of need and we were very dissatisfied with the level of professionalism and the wrong order.< /Review>

<Review>Was the worst experience. I went in to buy a large cake to celebrate an exciting event for my family and as soon as I went to cakes the employee wanted me to not touch the refrigerator where cakes were kept. Upon telling him I’m trying to see the cake he still told me to not touch and open. I walked out and won’t be walking back in. Disappointing. Don’t come here</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Date>1500260331738</Date><text>2 stars because it's not the worst service I've ever received, but it's the worst at a Cold Stone. It had been about 5 years since I'd been to this particular place. Went on National Ice Cream day and 1st of all the place was pretty much empty. The ice cream was made with minimal use of ingredients. Idk if this was a training issue or if they were just told to be stringy with the toppings. I won't be going back there again.</text></record>

Very disappointing!  The "Oh Fudge" milkshake I got didn't even have any fudge in it.  Also the cup of whip cream I separately purchased ( for my dog) was not real whip cream.  I don't go out for ice cream very often, and the few times I have been to Stone Cold Creamery the ice cream desserts have been much better.  This store cuts corners and charges the same prices.  Too bad this store is bringing down the quality of  Cold Stone Creamery.<//Review>

Treated poorly by staff every time I go in there.

I even went as far as to file a complaint with the company, and the next time I went in the people recognized me from before and treated me even worse.

If you value good service do not go here!</review>

The clinic is clean and comfortable. I am a Canadian who was living in the US suffering from antibiotic resistant infection for 5 months. Dr. Krista went above and beyond to make sure I was so well cared for and Brittney who was always there made me feel comfortable and was super helpful in arranging things back and forth with the hospitals, drs in Canada and myself. They both helped make me feel as well as I could mentally and physically when I was really struggling. If I could give 100 stars I would. Highly recommend!!</Text>< pics>

<resp>{'time': 1612735434365, 'text': 'We always reimburse when insurance pays. When there is a deductible, insurance does NOT pay and your office visit fee goes TOWARDS your deductible. Patients can call member services with their insurance company to have them go over any Explanations of Benefits to more easily understand what was paid or not paid by your insurance company. They will also go over the contracted rates that they (the insurance companies) set. Physicians do not set insurance company rates for any medical procedures or office visits. Rates are set by insurance companies. Most patients who have a deductible, want the visit going toward their deductible. If anyone prefers their visit to not go through their insurance company, they can simply pay for the visit without insurance and it will not go towards your deductible and your insurance rates will not be calculated. Physician billing goes strictly by the contracted rates with each insurance company, meaning all fees are set by an individuals\' insurance, so there is no "overcharging", there is only an insurance contracted rate.'}< /resp>< GmapID>

Krista has been phenomenal.  Her bedside manner is among the best of the best.  She is a good listener, very understanding and extremely professional and knowledgeable.  Her medical knowledge and experience hands down is the best I have had when feeling under the weather.< /Text>

If I could give more than 5 stars I would! Jackie is awesome! She is so sweet to my son and I. We Wouldn’t go anywhere else. She is very thorough and always asks if I have any questions. Other urgent cares hustle you in and out so quick you barely have time to ask any questions. Jackie never makes me feel rushed and really listens when I explain why I’m there. I will never go anywhere else. I drive all the way from Temecula to see her, she’s that awesome.<//review>

< Review>
I went here a few days ago and found the staff to be very accommodating and warm. I was turned down by another urgent care because they wouldn't take my insurance (which was a PPO). We called OUC late in the day already and they still accommodated us with no second thoughts.
When they saw I was filling out the paperwork out in the cold, they let me in the clinic and Krista put me in a room and turned the heater on. Krista's professional and bedside manner is amazing. You will feel comfortable with her and she will thoroughly explain things to you. It was already the clinic's closing time and I can tell she is tired, but she still treated me like I was her first patient of the day. She took time to listen and didn't rush me or made me feel like she needed to go. She is the kind of professional that really wants to work with her patients.
The young nurse staff were polite and engaging as well. One of them still needs more training with drawing blood though. It's all right since I'm used to bloodwork and have a high pain tolerance.
More so, OUC also helped me set up appointments with other doctors and find specialists that take my insurance. Thank you OUC.
I highly recommend this clinic. They treat people (with or without insurance) equally and properly.<//Review>

Love love love this place!!!! This is the BEST urgent care in North County. Very clean, clean, clean, efficient and they are so nice. I am so happy they are close to me. Everyone I have met there is very friendly and always trying to help. I love the vitamins too. They even have medications to buy so no waiting in a germy pharmacy line.</text>

We came in as our daughter had a very nasty stomach bug. We received excellent care! Everyone was kind, informative, empathic and efficient! Our daughter felt better quickly and so did we! Thanks to the staff for such warm and diligent, professional care.<//Review>

Oceanside Urgent Care is by far the best medical facility in the area. The staff was very welcoming and helpful, which was extremely welcoming.  I was in and out all within 30 mins even when it appeared busy.  I spoke with Elizabeth at the front desk and she got me in immediately to see Jeff H one of the providers with a condition that didn't seem favorable.  I had severe abdominal pain for a few days prior and couldn't stand the pain any longer, I am definitely not one who goes to doctors, but felt I didn't have much choice to see what was wrong with me.  I saw Jeff H and he diagnosed me with what appeared to be diverticulitis.  I was given a imagining order and went immediately to a local imaging place to get a CT scan.  The results weren't great but I at least knew what was going on.  Jeff spoke with me later that day and he prescribed certain medications and advised me to be on bed rest and change my diet (he even gave me a list of foods to eat)  After a few days, I certainly felt much better but not completely healed.  Having such an issue as diverticulitis, which in some cases can be debilitating, Oceanside Urgent Care was there to help, which I am grateful for.
I personally wanted to say thank you all and I feel much better thanks to this practice. Thank You!< /text>

Made an appointment two weeks ago was not informed that they did not take my Insurance. Thinking I’m gonna get the help I need I called to confirm my appointment. The receptionist tells me it’s cash only and Swears that she told me that. But I know me if I knew it was a $300 appointment I would not have made that appointment. Meanwhile I’ve wasted time I could’ve made an appointment With a care provider that took my insurance. I felt like I was being called a liar. There’s no way I would’ve agreed to pay $300 for something I could have done for free.<//text>

<text>Just wanted to give a shout-out to Dr. Polina Pavlova and the staff. I'm not from the area and needed urgent care and that is what they provided, CARE. I genuinely felt Dr. Pavlova's care towards my well-being and comfort, the staff provided exceptional help as well. When things go wrong with your health, it is good to know you can have a Doctor and team that you can trust - A million thank you's to this office - I will always recommend.< /text>< Pics>

<text>I am extremely satisfied with the care I received at Oceanside Urgent Care & Family Practice.  I was able to see the doctor almost immediately.  The facilities are excellent and the staff are warm and efficient. Dr. Islam is a very kind, caring, and astute physician. I would definitely be a repeat patient and would recommend their services to family.<//text>< Pictures>

Wow. This clinic was probably one of the best health clinic experiences I have ever had. As someone who travels extensively, and didn't have health insurance when I went in, I was able to be seen right away with a non-emergency visit. They even called to be sure I was coming in. Which I will admit seemed suspicious at first, but it was great! The one day visit was affordable even without insurance, and I was still able to have my prescription taken care of from a different state. I was in and out within an hour without even booking an appointment. The staff were all inviting, and I had great laughs with them. Very great service! It appears as if they offer a variety of services from botox to ear piercing as well, for anyone who may be interested in those experiences. What a cool place.<//text>

Female nurse practitioner named polina was rude and aggressive toward myself and my 11 year old son who was in agonizong pain with the flu. The medical assistant took his temperature incorrectly twice. They did not even weigh him and prescribed medication. This place is far below the standard of care for a medical facility.<//text>

WONDERFUL! Thank you Jacqui and Jeff!! This place is Great! The staff is amazing from start to finish! The most incredibly smart manager Jacqui looked up my insurance and within 10 minutes I was in the room. The nurse Chelsea was efficient and fast. The provider helped me and explained diagnosis-WROTE IT DOWN FOR ME! so I clearly understood what I was to do to get rid of my problem. I was in and out with medication they had there in 45 minutes. I have sat in waiting rooms longer than this. The clinic is super cute and very clean. There is tea and nice music. What a most pleasant experience!!! Thanks Oceanside Urgent Care!!!!<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Family oriented urgent care / nutritional care near down town Oceanside. Easy to find with bright yellow exterior color. Small but very busy practice.

This review started very negative. However, after a couple days I calmed down and went back to talk with staff. Randy, the office manager, listened and patiently we talked through the miscommunication.

I was very sick when first went in. Hindsight shows that I mis-understood what their practice could and could not do for me. Oceanside urgent care now gets a 5 star review for their customer care and showing that client satisfaction is top priority for their business.

Also, some time back, brought my son in for ear cleaning. Their staff were friendly and efficient with the doctor checking to make sure the service was well done.

I would recommend Oceanside Urgent Care for their wide variety of services.

Note to self – If very ill…. Direct to emergency is best.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<user_name>Mirta Tovar</user_name><text>I purchased B12 shots at the Oceanside Urgent Care for myself and daughter. After the first shot my daughter did not want to continue because shot made her arm sore for several days. We asked if I could have the money transferred to my account or exchanged for a different service . One of the co-owners was extremely rude and very matter a fact that they couldn’t do anything with the remaining unused balance except the B12 shots which was a package deal. Absolutely No exchanges or refunds. Be careful you don’t fall into this same trap. This is not a good way to promote business or keep clients happy. Would not recommend them to anyone. PS make sure you read their refund policy, in addition they don’t have a refund policy posted on website.</text>< user_id>

<text>I've been an Oceanside resident for my whole life and have seen this clinic building and never thought I would step foot inside. To my disbelief, I received a recommendation from a friend who was visiting from out of town. I visited the clinic based on his recommendation and had a wonderful experience. I called at 9 am to book an earliest possible appt. and they were able to see me 45 min later. I was a first time patient and was in and out of the office in just about 30 minutes. From the front desk to the physicians I was impressed and the care is top notch. I would definitely go back and happy to know I have another healthcare option in the neighborhood.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I would never recommend anyone to go there for the lady said please don’t come for your blood test. It might be an expensive bill.  I have a private insurance and instead of asking for it she assumed.  You might be wasting your money for this might not be needed because you were seen by a fill in physician.  She insulted her staff and didn’t want me to come in for a recommended blood test.  A little shocked....</text>

However, our regular staff is extremely aware of these charges, and what is covered, and what is not covered according to each patients diagnosis.We always try to inform patients, to the best of our knowledge if certain tests may not be covered. If you wish to have lab tests that will likely not be covered by your insurance, you are more than welcome to get them done, you can sign a release for the lab to send you a bill for whatever may not be covered.  Most of our patients appreciate this information so they can make an informed decision. This is not an insult to anyone, we watch out for our patients expenses.'}<//resp>

I've been here two times, since they are right next door. They helped my girlfriend out pretty quick and easy. It was a swollen splinter that needed to be pulled out properly. If you need a splinter pulled they are alright, or maybe a stitch or two. Anything more than that they are not equipped and under experienced.  I went in for a heart issue and after $500 in EKG and blood tests they tell me they don't have the equipment to tell me what's going on. Thanks! It's like the place that does the smog check with your light on to tell you they can't do it cause your light is on, after they charge you. They were quick to take my money though. Fast talkers. Ready to swipe your card.</Text>

We were in San Diego for the Surf cup soccer tournament and my daughter was ill with a severe gastrointestinal bug. I called and the staff was courteous and helpful, they even held the clinic open for us while we raced there to get the antibiotics she needed. Total lifesavers! The insurance billing was seamless.< /Text>

The staff was nice but other then that I was very disappointed with the care provided. The Nurse Practitioner didn't seem to have a clue what was bothering me. She told me one thing and then told me it was something else moments later. She asked that I get labs done, but I think it is because she wasn't sure what was wrong. The aid, I don't think she was a nurse, tried taking my blood but completely botched it. I have had to have blood taken every 3 to 6 months for the last 6 years and I have never had anyone do what she did. She felt around my arms for a few minutes and then asked me where they usually take blood from. She then proceeded to stick the needle in my arm but when she didn't hit a vein she decided to move the needle around in my arm. She pulled it partially out, with the tip of the needle still in my arm, moved it around and pushed it back in. After at least 6 attempts of this I asked her to stop. I could tell she had blown a vein. The wait was also pretty long. I waited a little over an hour but I could have handled that.< /Review>

Physician assistant, Lindsey Ackles knows more than any doctor I’ve ever visited! Her & the entire staff make you feel welcomed. Especially Randy the moment you walk in your bound for a smile somewhere in here! Also Most affordable urgent care I’ve ever seen</text>

This was the most excellent urgent care I ever went to. It was spotless and the staff was experienced and very  friendly and knowledgeable.  . I was seen in less than 15 minutes.  The people in this clinic truly care about their patience and their finances. I am a retired RN and and 72 years old. I have a lot of experience and I truly can say that I've never seen anybody like this before. I recommend them 2ne1 who wants good quick care with a smile.<//text>

As soon as u walk in the  ambiance,  Zen music playing, even to the color of the walls, I have a huge relief when I walk through there doors. I am a busy single mom with daughter with disability and I need a doctor close to home. I got really sick and they were their for me and have been there for me through my busy life. They have helped me with referred me to other professionals which they work close with which make me  feel secure and I can have everyone know what's going on with myself. I am very busy and I have wanted to share my experience.</review>< pics>

As an orthopedic physical therapist, an out-of-town family member called me for help regarding acute back pain and radiculopathy. I called the clinic to ask if they could provide certain types of care for my relative and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I was able to schedule my relative immediately and within an hour she was raving about how great her experience was. Individualized care and attention is something that I highly value in my practice, and I can tell that this clinic believes just the same. Can’t say how happy I am with the care and hope they have provided for my relative...you don’t get this with “big box” hospital systems. Highly recommend this clinic for urgent care and family medicine.<//Review>

They are the best for any and all my health care issues. They are nice, friendly, very competent, and caring. I brought my 82 year old mother here to review her medications and check lesions on her skin. My Mother's doctors in Texas pretty much ignored her skin lesions. Needless to say they froze off the one on her face and there is no scar!!! and biopsied the one on her hand and unfortunately found skin cancer, bummer. However, they referred her to Heidi Gilchrist, MD who removed the cancer and showed us just how much the cancer had spread. It wasn't the worst skin cancer but it also wasn't the best one to have, either. My Mother was very happy with the Oceanside Urgent Care & Family Practice team, especially Lindsay & Randy. I wouldn't want to have anyone else treat my family.< /review>

<Text>The biggest waste of time and money I hope to experience all year. Off the bat I heard other patients with different symptoms/demographics offered the same “treatments”. Took me an hour to leave with zero satisfaction. Save your time and money and just try to sleep it off rather than go to a doctor that also offers Botox and ear piercings.<//Text><pics>None</pics><rating>1<//rating><user>105289572509410454245<//user><Resp>{'time': 1563477739526, 'text': "We don't have a magic wand, but we can always make our patients more comfortable!"}</Resp></record></dataset><record>

LOVE this office & their staff is outstanding. Never in my life have I written a review before but after my first visit here, I just HAD to! Randy, the office manager is such an awesome character! I came in struggling with anxiety and a horrible cold and he still made me laugh! Everyone their is extremely helpful and super sweet. I would highly recommend ANYONE to go here. I just move to California and I will continue my care with Oceanside Urgent Care & Family Practice over any doctors office/urgent. Please, if you need to be seen for anything, go here and they will turn your day right around!</review>

I went into this urgent care location today for my migraines. Everyone from the person at the front desk to the nurses were all so kind. I was in and out within 20 minutes and even though I was feeling sick, my day was better because of there kindness. When needed, I will definitely continue going to them in the future.< /text>

DO NOT GO HERE. I went in for a physical and it was not good. First, I have always paid $25 for a physical my whole life but here it was $75. Second, the lady who did my physical barely spoke English and all she did was ask me if I was healthy physically and if I was on medication then left. THAT WAS ALL. I didn't get weighed, they didn't take my height, no vision exam, no blood pressure or heart rate check up, no pelvic exam, no Pap smear, no beast check. I was only asked two questions. Wasted an hour of my day and $75. The people were friendly, but that was it. Probably because they were happy they were stealing from all their customers. I also just got a bill in the mail months later for a totally random number and I called to clear it up because I was not paying another 60 dollars. They said my payment wasn't in the records MONTHS LATER so they billed me again. But if you were billing me again why were the amounts different and how do you not have full records months later?? I think they are scamming people out of money.< /Text>

I plan to report them the Consumer affairs and seeks legal action. They are unethical. Long story short we bought a package service and I didn't like it. They refused to transfer it to another service or back to the original purchaser. We weren't asking for a refund just for a different service. Jackie was beyond unethical, rude and arrogant.<//text>

<review>Wow. I've lived in Oceanside for 2 years and I've finally found a general physician. I've tried doctors from all around the area, but none were on par with this facility.  I walked in, gave them my information, and was called on not even 5 minutes later. The staff were all very friendly and seemed caring towards my personal problems. I'd 100% recommend this place to friends, family, and anyone else in need of care.<//review>< Pictures>

I walked in not feeling well at all. A little paperwork and straight in. I was listened to by the doc. She understood my complications, paid attention to my personal knowledge of my condition related to my body and didn’t dismiss my experience. Antibiotics issued immediately from the very friendly and informative Manager. This will be my go to urgent care from now on.</text>

This place was great. I was visiting from out of town and had forgotten some medication I needed.  I had already talked to another clinic that pretty much told me tough luck being from out of state. But I called here talked to Randy I believe and he said no problem were closing soon but hurry over and we will get you in before we close so you don't have to wait another day.  Got there Randy and the nurse got me taken care of quick. Dr understood completely took care of me with enough medication to cover my time in town and in and out in about 15 minutes which is unheard of in walk in clinic's. Thanks a ton Oceanside Urgent Care</text>

I would definitely recommend this office for either urgent care or as your primary care physician. I originally came in for the urgent care and ended up with them as my family practice doctor's office. The staff is very friendly and accommodating,  and the doctor is excellent. Dr Kenney is great,  he really takes his time with patients and listens to what they have to say, I never feel rushed out the door like at some offices.<//review>

<Text>My 6 year old had pain in her ear and drainage. Her pediatrician was out of town and his nurse practitioner wasn’t taking any more appointments. Rady’s urgent care didn’t open till 4 so I tried this place. They were wonderful. Everyone was friendly. The clinic was clean and tidy. There were games and a little activity table available for children in the waiting room. I really appreciate that as most mothers of multiple little ones would. The nurses, receptionist and doctor we saw were friendly and professional. They examined my daughter very quickly after arriving and talked her through the process of what they were doing. We weren’t rushed at all. Everyone made sure to make my daughter feel cared for. They took the time to talk to her and ask her what she was feeling. She and my son were given their favorite stickers after the visit. My kids left happy and unafraid of the doctors office. The doctors even offered to check on her in a few days free of charge if I had any concerns just to make sure she was feeling beter.Overall great experience. I would definitely recommend this place and will return if I need medical treatment in the future for myself or my kids.<//Text>< date>

Been trusting this crew with my health needs for over a year now. All are professional, caring and highly recommended by me.

I give especially high marks for Dr. Kenney, Certified Physician's Assistant Kuykendall, and Randy at the front desk!

I've recommend my family to their services and you will, too...  BOOM! (I just dropped the microphone)< /text>

<Text>They're great and provide quality family & urgent care. Randy & Lindsay are the Best! Lindsay spotted cancer on my Mom's hand that other MDs failed to diagnose, so she is super gentle, kind, and really a top notch practitioner. The other MDs, PAs, and nurses are great as well. There is free street parking and a few spaces including a disabled accessible parking around the corner in the back.<//Text>< pics>

Love Dr Kenny he's from my old neighborhood and remembers my Grandfather (who has passed) and his old Pharmacy (Bird Rock Pharmacy) ... So I feel like I can talk to him about anything and he always listens with honest feedback< /Text>

First, I had a good experience.  They lured me in.  Then they started decreasing my medicine and it wouldn't last me all month and I had to go twice a month and pay each time.  Doctor seemed to care more about himself than me and my suffering, in fact he actually told me flat out.  This is why I wait to leave reviews.

Bottom line, for urgent care they're fine, I may even recommend them.  For family practice they are the epitome of the problems of modern medicine and in the end I was robbed $200 in a single month for nothing.  Most family practice I've had in past don't even charge for refills.  This place would make you go without medicine before giving a refill without charging.  Big pockets, no heart.</Text>

<text>I went in and was seen very quickly due to my son crying due to an ear ache. The staff was so nice and professional. The doctor was so good with a kid who doesnt likes shots. I've never had a doctor visit so pleasant.
Thank you Oceanside Urgent care. You guys were so patient and did so well with my son.</text>< Pics>

I was suffering with a chronic case of insomnia due to stress and they took care of me the day I called, giving me a prescription for a sleep medication.  They weighed me, took my blood pressure & listened to my lungs, etc.  Also they were very friendly and listened & answered all of my questions.  Overall a good experience and would definitely come back if necessary.<//text>

My wife went there for urgent care because it was the nearest place to go. They charged twice for the same service.  We have tried to get reimbursement , but they have not paid us. Randy was very rude and sarcastic about it.  Now has been almost 3 months.  the pace looks and is very unprofessional.
Save your self the frustration!</Text>

At first, seemed friendly and caring... then once I went a few times I started seeing this places true colors. I called 3 people from my insurance saying any urgent care should accept all family members for visits any time more than twice a year they argued with me and even when I got someone from tricare on the phone They still argued, they charged us, haven’t paid it back. They prescribed me a medication where I got side effects and when I called to ask about it, they tried telling me that I need to stop calling so much and that she would be happy to see me if I came in, meaning they just wanted money for the appt. and just recently I went to another urgent care that didn’t charge me because they knew tricare changed the twice a year rule, and they told me to call tricare because this wasn’t right. They seem like a friendly staff at first, but once you see them a few times I can tell they don’t care.  I even heard the attitude in their voice over the phone, and he kept telling me he’s gonna believe who he talked to after I called 3 different tricare providers that all told me the same thing that I can be seen by an urgent care anytime. They have still not paid back any of the money they charged us.</Text>

I got there around 8:30 am and I was sitting outside I saw one of the staff there on the other side. So at 9:00am I got and waiting for the doors to open but I waited until 9:15 am and it was still closed and no one came to tell me what going. So I decided to called and the person tell me on the phone that there were working on the air condition and have no idea when there are going to be open. A little too late.<//Review>< Pictures>

DO NOT GO!  If you are from out of town and expecting a TRUE urgent care- this is NOT it. I fell and needed to have my ankle looked at, only to be charged $124.00 for the doctor to tell me that I needed to go somewhere else for xrays ("which could have another charge"). He then slapped a sports wrap on my ankle (which didn't even go around my ankle because he ran out)... yes, a sports wrap NOT an ace bandage! A waste of my time and money. However, if you are looking for a doctor that will give you pain meds quickly... this is your place.  Yes, everyone is very friendly but their lack if knowledge and lack of modern technology really dates this place. Don't waste tour time here - go somewhere else!!!!!<//review>

<Review>Do yourself a favor and save your money and perhaps your life and go anywhere else for your medical care. These guys are completely unprofessional and downright dangerous.
First suggested I smoke a ton of pot for my insomnia. I let them know that the majority of employers drug test so that isn’t an option for most. Wrote me a prescription in someone else’s name. Pharmacy caught it, called and was told the PA, Michael Kays, that wrote it wasn’t there and would be in next day and he would call them back. He never did. I called several more times asking that it get corrected to no avail. I drove back to the office the following week to find a note on the door stating they were closed for two weeks due to billing code??? Two weeks turned in to 5 – they never retuned one call or message. I was driving by one day, 5 weeks later and seen the doors open so stopped and of course that PA wasn’t working but there was another one there that at least got my name right on the prescription but put zero refills where the other had 3. I asked about that and was told it wouldn’t be a problem to refill. The pharmacy just need call. Well of course it come time to refill and after three request from my pharmacy with no response, I call and was told the PA wasn’t working (for two weeks – 3 requests???) and that I would need to come in for an office visit, at my expense, because the PA that was working had never seen me.
Time to find a real office that cares about my health instead of their wallets.</Review>< Pics>

I am completely dissatisfied with my visit yesterday for my type one diabetic prescriptions. First of all Dr. Puhlev seemed to know absolutely nothing about how to write the perscriptions even though I clearly went through everything I needed. He did not even write my prescriptions for the correct amount and even left out a few that I needed. He even asked me if they really gave test strips through prescription. I was very upset and felt my $125 was a HUGE waste. I do not suggest wasting your time at this place. Really upsetting.< /text>

Don't go here! I looked up this place got a friend who is visiting the US because the practice describes itself as a place to help international visitors, but it does not do that. He was charged $125 before even seeing the doctor. The doctor told him he could not help him and wrote him a referral to a doctor in Carlsbad. My friend went there only to find out the referral doctor doesn't work there. Charging a $125 to tell someone they can't help them and giving them a referral to a doctor who isn't working is just not right. When my friend went back to ask for a refund the receptionist refused to help stating my friend had to schedule an appointment with the doctor to discuss a refund.
About a week later (due to the holidays) I went in with my friend to speak with the doctor l, as the receptionist told him he had to do. This time the receptionist said he had 4 referrals for my friend. My friend said he didn't want to use them. The receptionist said that he would give him a refund. (Then accidentally charged him another $125). He eventually got the refund ($250). I'm changing from one star to two, only because he was able to get the refund.<//Text>

Very friendly after trying to get in to a few dfferant comnity clinics and the wait was months out and 3 other urgent cares didn't do what I needed and others were 3 × the cost I've have to say this was the best place around hands down. So as I said very friendly no wait time in and out and best price around what more would you want</review>

<Review>I can’t recommend Life Storage enough. This is my second time using their services. The staff is always very helpful and very friendly. I feel completely confident that my items are safe with them. I’ve had really good experiences with them & I plan on returning. Check them out next time you need a storage unit!</Review><name>Maria Lucero<//name>< time>

It was a last minute decision that we needed to find a storage place to put all our stuff temporarily. Life storage was convenient and perfect. The manager was great in getting us set up. It was quick and easy. The facility was clean and safe. Thank you.< /Text>

I assumed storage is storage. Just make it convenient to get to, keep my stuff safe, and don’t charge me an arm and a leg just because you can. This place checks all 3 boxes AND they have phenomenal customer service! Becky is a dream to work with and the other gentleman that works there (I’m sorry- I am blanking on his name right now!) is friendly and helpful as well.
For those who may have Covid concerns the office takes full precautions.< /Text></record>

<pics>None</pics><review>I was recently looking for an inexpensive medium sized storage unit where I can keep our family luggages, seasonal items, and seasonal clothing/shoes to allow for more space in our apartment. After doing my Google research, I found the perfect unit at Life Storage in Rohnert Park. I looked through their website and found the unit size I wanted, the monthly lease price is lower than other storage companies around RP, and I had the ability to complete all of the paperwork and payment online. In just ten minutes I had a storage unit, a copy of my contract, and the information on how to access the property and unit. Later on in the evening, I went to Life Storage and I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the property and how safe ai felt because there are cameras everywhere! The unit is in a great location - very close to the entrance/exit - and was clean. There was a cute welcome bag in the unit that had the new lock, a little swag, and brochures. To top it off, I received a call today from Becky, the manager, to tell me about the services they offer, the equipment they have available during business hours, and to make sure everything was OK with the unit. To say the least, I am extremely pleased.<//review></record>

Prices were affordable, and the worker that helped us was incredibly nice and helpful! She made the process easy and quick and was very good at explaining everything. I would recommend this place to other college students, as the prices are college budget friendly compared to other places!< /Text>

The price is what got me in.  The excellent service is what will keep me. They went above and beyond in helping me.  The manager is amazing - friendly and helpful in many ways.  She spent a lot of time with me figuring out if my trailer would fit and helped me back it in - all the while with a smile on her face !  I would give them 10 stars!!!</text>

<Review>Really appreciated the friendly check in process we had last week with the assistant manager, he was able to walk us through everything we needed in a timely and courteous fashion. All the information from my phone call with Becky was efficient and helpful before we showed up, and she was super helpful in following up on our reservation dates for move in to make sure we good get the storage unit size necessary,</Review>< Time>

<Text>Simply the best storage place I've ever been to. The lady that works her is super friendly and nice. She gave me all the details and a first month discount. I immediately got a second unit. It's also not crowded and the security is very high. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to store things for a shorterm or long term</Text>< Pics>

<review>This is the second time I have used this facility and each time I am pleased. The facility is always clean and secure. The pricing on the units are also quite good.  The staff are pleasant and I have never minded working with them when I had questions.

The first time I used them was when I moved from Daly City to Santa Rosa.  The fires that hit Santa Rosa happened while my things were there, and the management made sure I was aware that my unit was safe.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>Renting a unit at Life Storage was the best experience possible. The price was right, the units were clean and the staff were incredible. Becky and Rodney are two of the nicest, most patient and most competent people I have ever met. EVER met. Needing a storage unit came with a stressful time in my life and these people made the whole process feel like an actually pleasant experience.<//Review>< pics>

<review>I have been a long time tenant at Storage Solutions in Rohnert Park on Martin Drive and I cannot start to tell you how AMAZING the staff has been. Becky, which I have never met should be employee of all time. She's intelligent,  polite and considerate.  When I  had cancer she made it possible for me to keep my storage at a discounted rate until I was better. Without her, I truly believe that I would have already changed storage units with another company.
The units are clean and anytime there are changes being made like painting, they are quick to make sure we, as customers are aware at all times.
Again.,I'm so pleased with my unit and Becky being the best best best employee ever.
Becky...I hope someone recognizes you and lets you know how amazing I think you are.

This place is fantastic. Used them once before and when I need space again, came right back. They have great friendly service, the place is clean and has good access hours. Best of all it is less expensive than just about anyone else. If you are pondering choices, dont. Use this one, I have twice and I'm glad I did.<//text>

I rented a unit here years ago before Life Storage took over. Back then, it was satisfactory - safe, clean, and cheap. But the new owners have done some remodeling, repainting, and now it’s safe, clean, cheap and pretty!

Rodney helped me sign up for my unit and get moved in. Super easy process and I’m grateful for a convenient storage solution. Thanks!< /Review>

<Text>I have had my storage unit here for over two years and have always been happy with customer service and cost.  New owners took over and completely revitalized the storage units with all sorts of new things like cameras, paint jobs, and I think new doors.  They have always been very on top of letting their customers know what is going on with the buildings by actual mailed letters, which is nice.  Ryan has always been my guy to go to whenever my credit card numbers need updating and I have always been impressed by his professionalism.  I recall an afternoon where there were issues with the gates and he had a customer being so incredibly rude.. but Ryan was so calm about it and handled the issue pretty quickly.  Other mentions are Rodney, who also is very helpful in getting whatever I need taken care of!  Thank you so much, Storage Solutions.  You make living without all my stuff that much easier.  :)< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808435fb821f27d9:0xa8bbe111e5b94362< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>A refreshing and competent staff guided me through the process to find a perfect storage space, at a fair price, for our needs. Rental contract details were explained clearly, no hidden surprises. BIG kudo to Becky and the help of from Rodney, giving the show and tell options of my selection. First Class Operation.

I rented at this location 4 years ago and thought I'd come back due their great price.  I was a little hesitant at first due to my experience, but when I called, they said it's under new ownership and many upgrades to the site.  When I got there, omg, a brand new office and so many security cameras.  New gate and keypad system too.  Ryan and Rodney the manager showed me around and I was sold.  Property was clean and they did a great job in managing the place.  They are very stern about the rules and policy which made me feel safer.  Keep up the great job and change.  I've referred several of my friends and family since they are great and price can't be beat.</Text>

I went online to look at storage facilities in Rohnert Park and I ended up calling Storage Solutions.  My wife and I ended up moving in because they weren't pushy and listened to what our needs were.  Thank you so much!<//Text>

< review>
have been using Life Storage over the course of 6+ years now, first got a 10x10 indoor unit back in 2013 for a couple large items that would not fit in my apartment. Back then i believe was a different name, Storage Solutions, so possibly a different company ? Then after about a year, I moved my items out. A few years later,2016, I came back and got a 10x15 outdoor unit and had that for two years. this was around the time Storage Solutions turned into Life Storage. everything got a make over with new paint, better locks,etc. I moved out of that unit in 2018, and just recently got a 5x10 indoor unit to store a few couches and bins of stuff that were taking up too much space. I keep coming back because the staff is friendly and helpful .... even when my forgetful self forgets a payment, they give me a nice courtesy call with a reassuring "no worries lol" additude ... not to mention its one of the cheaper storage facilities in the santa rosa/rohnert park area. And i like that it has a gated access for a more secure feel, I do wish there was over night access though, there has been times ive stored my ocean fishing poles in the unit and friends wanted to go night fishing or super early morning fishing but it was within the nonaccessable hours, but that doesnt take away from the 5 stars i give them</review>

<Review>UNSAFE place to store your valuable stuff. I rented a 10x5 space at this facility for six months and my storage was burglarized! When notified about the incident, facility Manager informed that Security camera DVR broke down few weeks back and they don't have any backup. Manger did help me with the filing of the police and insurance complaint!<//Review><date>1512493231461< /date>< pictures>

<Text>The associates at LifeStorage were my saviors this summer when I needed somewhere to store my dorm items. They helped make it affordable and within my budget, and when it came time for us to clean out they went above and crying when my roommates and I forgot our lock. I am so grateful to those at LifeStorage and will definitely go here again!</Text>< Pictures>

Extremely over priced for what you get. They prey on Sonoma State students and make insurance mandatory.  Go anywhere but.<//Review>

Everyone at this office is awesome! So friendly! I’ve never really liked the dentist office and my daughter needed braces and some other things done and I was so scared for her to go to a place I hated as a child but she LOVES going to this office. She LOVES the staff. She’s usually shy but she is so talkative with the everyone there because she feels so comfortable. She asks questions and the doctors explain everything to her so that she (and I) understand. They work around your schedule and are affordable. I will always use them, no one else!< /Text>

I love Bear creek! They have the best customer service and when I was looking for a dental group for my two year old they were the first to really respond to my concerns and made the whole experience for him very comfortable. They’re just great overall!!< /Text>

Everyone in this office is very friendly, energetic and helpful! It was my first time here and the ladies at the front desk made me feel very welcomed. My Doctor was very nice, she was gentle yet very thorough with my teeth cleaning and I really appreciated it. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a new Dentist! The people who work here really seem to love what they do.<//text>

I have been here three times and every time I have come in, I experience wonderful service from the office ladies, dentist and dental assistant.  Doctor Sanders is knowledgeable and friendly and he is honest in dealing with my dental treatment.  Never leave feeling that the recommended treatment was unnecessary and I always feel I’m in good hands.  Alisa is always accommodating and friendly and makes me feel like I’m part of the family.  Wonderful dental office!</Review>

<Time>1620499803002<//Time><rate>5</rate><Review>Dr. Do is the kindest, most caring dentist I've ever met. My daughter is terrified of dental procedures and Dr. Do took the time to sit with her and comfort her through a difficult root canal procedure. Everyone in this office has treated my daughter like family. They are always kind and understanding even when my daughter repeatedly waits too long to get treatment. I've also had dental work done here and they were amazingly patient and kind to me. I highly recommend Dr. Do and Bear Creek Dental!< /Review>< pics>

<review>This is the most welcoming dental office I have ever been too! From the front end staff, to the hygienist, to the dental assistants and dentists. Even my daughter has felt comfortable and looks forward to going to the dentist since she was only 3 years old because of this staff. They do amazing work and are very honest in what needs to be done.<//review>< rate>

Again, what an awesome experience. I drive an hour and twenty minutes and am greeted with a “Good morning, Robert !” when I walk through the door. From the friendly staff and the professional doctors I would definitely recommend this office to anyone.</text>

10/10 would recommend! This office has an amazing staff. The front desk is super welcoming, friendly and
professional! The office is super clean and practices all necessary Covid-19 precautions.
Shout out to Jenn for always greeting me with a smile!

Additionally, I’ve had AMAZING results! I’ve been going to this office for the past two years and and I’ve been blown away by the work they do every time. My mouth is always minty fresh when I walk out!!!!

Dr. Arad has outstanding bedside manner. He always makes me feel comfortable and has a super gentle hand; never hurts the inside of my mouth like other orthodontists/ Dentists. Thank you, Dr!</text>

In November 2018, I received 4 crowns from Dr. Do at Bear Creek Dental. My front tooth was chipping and even though these teeth were sound, she advised that it would probably be best to do this. I agreed. I continued to go to my every three month cleanings and also received lasers to assist with my gums. Something did not feel right with the teeth and I expressed this to the doctor. She sent me to their endodontist to have him look at them. He found nothing wrong. This was in the early part of 2019. I was still feeling numbness in the area above my teeth and nobody could find anything. Fast forward to June, 2020, a year and a half after paying $4,000 for crowns, every one of those 4 crowns failed and I had infections on every tooth, even though I had cared for them by doing the deep cleanings which they suggested and the laser. The other two dentists that took xrays and saw the amount of infection were extremely surprised that these crowns were only 1-1/2 years old. I asked Bear Creek Dental for a full refund and did not get a response. I was on a payment plan with them and they did allow me to quite paying the balance which was $1,400. I am disappointed that the did not even respond to my request. I have since had these teeth pulled and am wearing a denture now. I do not recommend a dentist who cannot stand by their work. Crowns should not fail in a year and a half. Secondly, they did not even respond to my request.</text>

Dr. Sanders was very sweet, attentive, and thorough. He took the time to talk to me when I was nervous about a procedure and to discuss my dental fears (going to the dentist is not my favorite thing to do). They were also great with my 3 year old. The receptionists are super friendly. I have nothing but good things to say about this place.</Review>< Pictures>

I wish I could give this place a negative 5 star review. STAY AWAY YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. I went in for a check up and cleaning today not expecting to get a Quote. Since I didn’t have $1,000 to cough up (that’s with insurance) I agreed to pay the $152 for a deep cleaning at least. I waited for the lady to get a with cash in hand which I’ve never done she came back and said they didn’t have time to schedule a appointment. Metaphorically speaking I went in for an oil change and they were trying to sell me a car. This place is MONEY HUNGRY!! I first saw a hygienist who told me I needed a deep cleaning and a bacterial rinse the doctor who asked if I grind my teeth then a desk lady with a quote. I then asked just basic questions and she said I would have to talk to the doctor who had already went home. The DOCTORS NAME IS DR.PARK. For the record I have no cavities and just was there in October.<//review>

My husband had some dental work done with Dr. Choi and Dr. Do. He was extremely nervous and really just did not want to have it done. Dr. Do has been amazing from the start. She helped me out over the phone before she ever saw my husband. Both Dr. Do and Dr. Choi were so amazingly helpful, kind, patient and gentle with husband. I have never received the type of service she offered by any other health care professionals. We are definitely patients for life.< /Review>

<Review>Dr. Lin and the Hygienist Carmen were great! I went in for a check up and they worked with me in regards to pricing, care, and cleaning for the work that i desperately needed done. They were flexible with me and got me as soon as possible.

Yes there was a wait in the waiting room but I just scheduled that in to my appointment as everyone should know stuff like this comes up where you need to wait 10 more minutes. The quality care was outstanding. The staff was friendly, helpful, and caring to my condition, I am glad that we caught the work that was needed to do in time to save me thousands of dollars in bills and permanent damages.</Review>< Pics>

First off let me say I love the staff and dentists here and have been a patient for many years.
My elderly mom is disabled and had a set of old dentures.  They were old dentures but she could eat with them fine.
She has a small bottom jaw so her old provider left in about six teeth so her dentures would fit.
I took her to see Dr. Park . He said her teeth needed to come out and although her jaw is a bit hard to fit, they can give her a much better set, and  they could have the surgeon pull her teeth and build up her gum.
When I took her in for the surgery,  she was in the room for not even 10 minutes. I thought something was wrong when they called me back to the room. He was done!!
He didn't put her under,  nor did he build up her gums. He just ripped out her teeth.
Now, thousands of dollars later and many visits, she can't eat anything that needs to be chewed.
Her top teeth are very crooked and the bottoms fall out no matter how gum paste she uses.
All they tell her is, her mouth is hard to fit!
My niece and I paid thousands of dollars on our credit cards for Mom.
I had moved out of state and when I saw her teeth recently, I cried.  She cries all the time because she cannot chew food anymore.
Do not go to their surgeon! He's  terrible and ruined my mom's mouth.  I'm still paying for her work on my credit card.< /Review>

To start off the entire crew is so nice and knowledgeable.  They are great to help with payment.  They also make me fell comfortable. Dr. Lim is a great doctor I have been searching for a dentist that I like and finally found one.  He also worked on my daughter and the care he took with her not to frighten her was above and beyond what he needed to do. I recommend anyone searching for a dentist go here and see Dr. Lim he is great.< /text>

READ THE OTHER LOW REVIEWS FIRST!  YOU WILL NOTICE A COMMON THREAD AMONG ALL!  $$$$$$$$$$$$$  It is all about the $$ here!

First visit, fix a lost filling.  Great!  Got my daughter in quickly and no issues
Went again for cleaning.  They pushed her appointment back 30 min and didn't tell us prior or at check in.  Made her wait 30 as well.  So she sat in the waiting room with a recently broken foot for 1 hr.
Ok, will try again..... she went for a cleaning.  Tried to upsell her on more advanced cleaning with laser and partial crown ($150 total).  Was very suspicious, about Doctors explanation.  Sounded like a normal adult cleaning to me, and it wasn't a crown, but a porcelian layer.  Ok, so I "bought" his sales pitch.  Except her tooth has needed 2 more visits since and she still can't eat off it.
you think we would have learned, but today my son went in.... they tried to upsell him by $500!  2 filings (I am sorry, those are covered by our insurance) and then that same laser treatment (oh, the one his sister needed a week ago for $150?).
Place is complete use car upsell mentality.  We have Delta Dental insurance, so cleanings and cavities are covered, yet they want $650 extra and even when they got extra money, their work wasn't even good!!!!
Those are purely the facts, decide for yourself.< /Text>

Some of the pictures are not of the place I went to, so I'm not sure the other reviewers are reviewing the same place as i am. Anyway, I'm a big crybaby when it comes to going to the dentist. But (almost) everyone I interacted with was unbelievably nice, which made my 7-hour visit bearable (I got x-rays, deep cleaning, and 3 crown placements.) I am extremely grateful they baby'd me while making sure I was as comfortable as possible the whole time. One thing I would strongly suggest is to bring something to do while waiting in the exam rooms, I don't know why they don't have televisions. Also, some exam rooms are really cold during the summer, so dress in warm clothes.<//Text>< Pictures>

What a horrible  experience  I had at this location. I went in for a simple extraction and now I have 2 payments one of $174 and approved for credit card of $1500 payments of $125. I'm retired and on a fixed income. $300 a month is absolutely ridiculous. And to top it off my teeth dont feel the same. I cant chew correctly.  I will never be going to there again and dont recommend them.<//text>

Best dentist I've been to in my life. If you're having a bad day, go to this dentist!  I met most of the office and every single person was extremely warm and friendly.  The office itself is very nice and the employees are skilled and knowledgeable.  They didn't try to sell me a bunch of expensive stuff either.<//review>

The fist week I took my children for their checkups, I liked how Dentist Jim Park treated my little ones.  The second week it was my turn to go and I was recommeded some work done, which was all taken care of in the same visit. I was happy to get all the info and that they answered all my concerns. But best of all that i was treated according to my personal dental needs. Guliana was my dental hygienist and I couldn't have asked for a more professional and compassionate person. Thank you for making our experience a great one!< /text>

<Text>Amazing is what I can say.  We recently moved to Murrieta and looked for a new kids dentist and met Becca at a kids baseball game and she told us where she worked.  Myself deathly terrified of the dentist (going in gives me panic attacks) took my 4, 7 & 9 year old to see Dr. Park.  Keep in mind it's not a full on kids dental office so no TV's, video games in the rooms.

We walked in and the staff is welcoming and made it more comfortable.  Becca took us back and cleaned my youngest kiddo's teeth.  She took pictures (not x-ray) of her teeth to see if they could see anything wrong without exposing her to radiation. Dr. Park came in and looked and said she was good.  A few hours later we returned with my middle kiddo.  Same process but her got x-rays too.  He ended up having 3 cavities and what I didn't expect was them to be able to fill them right then and there. That was awesome. No return visit, less anxiety in my life.   Turns out we needed an orthodontic consult so they were able to schedule us for that for the next week. Same with my oldest in needing an orthodontic consult.

Dr. Park & Becca are amazing with all 3 kids and super patient with them.  Puts my mind at ease while being there.

We will be returning again and have already referred strangers to the office.<//Text>< pictures>

I do not recommend this place at all. Only came here because I had to change insurances and my old dentist did not take the new one. Came in in quick because I had a horrible tooth ache that would not stop for three days. I call and they get me in next morning and sounded extremely nice. I come in first thing and everyone is very nice but I know now that's just because they want to take advantage of you. I was in so much pain and the dentist comes in (young guy with a man bun) he does his inspection and decides my tooth has to be extracted because it is cracked. I asked why I was so swollen (my cheek was swollen) because I was pretty sure it was infected. He says no, its not infected its just the nerves irritated. He tells me ill be in pain until i remove the tooth, so i said okay when can we remove it. Not until a week and a half later! I say okay can I get pain meds to help until then (he did) They then have the girl come in with ofcourse the most expensive option out there that the insurance doesn't cover. (which he did tell me the implant would be most expensive) but why only come in with that option...I ask for the other options which they leave and have to come back with, but I then notice my insurance copay was different then the amounts they stated. I then ask why because I had it up on my phone and they say oh oh we can change it because this is a specialist which is a different insurance code....Okay why try to pull it past me when it was a HUGE difference. I go home to think about all the options and when I call to schedule the removal they schedule with the specialist without even telling me. I only knew because I asked and I said does this have to be done by the specialist to extract one tooth and they said no but she is "soooo great". okay...  no, all is sketchy. I then call my old dentist because I trust them and they begged me to come in or get a second opinion because it all sounded off to them. (That dentist is all the way in Santa Monica) and being in so much pain I didn't want to drive all the way out there. I sent them pictures and they said "honey you are infected" we can tell just by looking at you, you need antibiotics.  I decided to go to Urgent Care and the doctor said the same thing, its very obvious you're infected you need to go to dentist, I said I just did! She said they didn't give you antibiotics, i said no they just want to remove my tooth. She shuck her head and said "you need a new dentist" She gave me a shot of antibiotics, steroids and antibiotics to take for 10 days... She said if they would have removed this tooth with this infection, it could have easily spread and made matters much worse. You need to be on antibiotics and remove the infection before you remove the tooth....WOW who knows what would have happened if i went back... I am now better and went back to my dentist (I dont have insurance with) and they checked to say my tooth does NOT need to be removed, it is not cracked. Its so sad that someone was trying to take advantage of me while in pain. I will be calling my insurance to change to another provider.</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>I have always loved this store because of their unique merchandise by local artists or businesses. Not to mention I’m a huge supporter of local Long Beach stores and rarely shop at bigger or mainstream places. The staff is usually very friendly and outgoing. However, today that was not the case and I won’t be back, ever. The older gentleman that was there was unkind and just plain rude! I literally asked 2 questions and he made me feel like I was bothering him. I walk to the register to pay for my item and again just so unkind and the only thing he said during the transaction was my total and “take your card out” he then walked away abruptly! That’s it! He didn’t even look at me or say a simple “thank you”... “would u like a receipt?” or “have a nice day” Just walked away... smh.
It’s just bad business and flat out rude AF! So take your hard earned money elsewhere! It’s sad that Made has this grumpy old man working there. There is no reason for people to be treated this way when supporting a business. There is never anyone in there, maybe he is the reason?!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>This place absolutely fantastic for buying local Long Beach gifts for friends or for yourself.

They have lots of One Of A Kind items, most of which are handmade by local residents. There are a lot of Long Beach themed items as well, so this is the perfect spot for unique souvenirs.

The staff here are friendly and helpful.

The store is very interested in everything local, hosting events supporting the neighborhood, art exhibits about Long Beach. Some other fun stuff as well.

This place is well worth a pit stop while you are visiting Long Beach.<//Text><username>Darren Galindo</username>< Response>

<text>Very nice little shop in downtown LB. The retail space is packed with local-made products ranging from handbags to pickled peppers! It's a fantastic place to pick up a gift for that special someone, or if you want to grab some premium goodies to support your local makers! I have my eye on their locally roasted coffee and hot sauce selection, but they also have soaps, candles, stationary and much more.

My only negative would be some of the prices were a bit ridiculous. I understand you get what you pay for, and honestly its worth it to know the money is going to some creative folks living in the city, however some tags were just gasp worthy! (Example: a small bag made of recycled material about a foot long by 8" high was priced at approx $250!! It was a nice bag, but not THAT nice!!)

I hope this shop stays open for a long time, its things like this that encourage folks to make their own goodies and sell to their community. Its an awesome idea with a beautiful execution.< /text><time>1431024567197</time><pictures>None<//pictures>< user_name>

This place could easily be seen as the heart of Long Beach; everything sold inside is made by potential (or newly introduced) small business owners. Chocolate, pies in jars, hand made candles, leather goods and jewelry, Long Beach printed clothing and more!<//Review>

Well done MADEOn Sunday's and Thursdays THE WILD CHIVE, vegan, restaurant- style pop-up can't be compared to other vegan food.

<review>MADE is a super cool shop servicing downtown Long Beach by carrying local makers of all sorts: jewelry, clothing, housewares, ceramics, doggie stuff, accessories, furniture, and lots of edibles like chocolate, sauces, teas/coffees, and more!

Downtown LB is small but mighty. The East Village has a small amount of local shoppery, but that's about it. MADE almost suffered the fate of many businesses that attempt to make it on Pine but with some creative and loving business dealings seems like it is putting down roots and will become a staple of DTLB.

The large space also hosts many community events like art shows, holiday parties, readings, polling, monthly/weekly pop-ups, and a lot of other creative and cool reasons to drop in.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

< review>
I participated in a crowdfunding program for them, which said contributors at my level would receive a wooden map of Long Beach in October 2015. I understand with crowdfunding programs you may not always get the final product, but October 2015 rolled around and there were no updates. I contacted them several times and finally got a response in January. Then, a month ago, I received an email that the maps were ready and mine would be shipped out by April 20. Almost 4 weeks later...nothing. I've emailed DW Ferrell, called the store, posted on Facebook...no response to my request that they confirm the address it was shipped to and provide me with a tracking number. Needless to say, their customer service is horrible.< /review>

<review>I usually get gas here once every two weeks to fill up and I don't go inside I usually do everything at the pum. When I do they're somewhat friendly that's about it.  Just for gas no other advice or need any other services it's clean the prices are sometimes good they vary, like at this time the price is $3.89 a gallon for Supreme right now so that's a little high so,  I'm shopping around somewhere else where the gas is a little bit lower. Other than that they are very convenient because they're right on the way to the freeway.</review>< Pics>

No problems. Haven't used the car wash yet but it looks competent. Machine wash, hand dry and detailing. Shops, restaurants and out services are near. Public transportation and a few blocks from 580 freeway.< /Review>

That attendant at the counter was very friendly. Also their prices are very reasonable. They also have a mechanic that works on cars as well. You can get tires here as well or get a flat fixed. If you're hungry, this Mobil gas station also have a taco truck there. on the weekends you can get your car washed as well for a small fee.<//review>

<Text>We went here as a party of 15. They accommodated our reservation with only a couple days. The service was incredible, very attentive. The food was much better than expected. I had the mussels in white wine and my husband had the lamb stew. Both were delicious. The appetizers we got were all quite good but the escargot isn't worth it.<//Text>< rating>

The only two seats available (this place is TINY and there are no tables - only counter seats that face the mirrored wall or the kitchen) faced the wall and that was fine, but almost immediately two seats facing the kitchen opened and we were able to switch.</Text>< Pictures>

The food was delicious and really tasty. We got there very early and so the place was empty with not very appealing decor. Once the food arrived it turned out amazing and would definitely come again.< /Text>

If you are looking for an authentic french place in the city, this is one of the best options. Delicious food, good wine and friendly service.

I recommend the mussels and the combozola cheese.</Review>

I had the pork chop - delicious. Wife had the chicken on recommendation of the staff... Amazing. Friends had the steak and they loved it, for the table we had the tartare which was really great, calamari which was decent given you can find it anywhere, lamb sausage great if you like a little heat on your dish. Overall great experience and the staff was great. We were in a back room because we had 3 like kids... Still managed to really enjoy our meal.</text>

Great food and great service!

The French toast is the best in the city. I've had the escargot as well and I recommend 100%.

The last time I visited was on a Thursday and this was the first time I ever had their scallop special. They are to die for. Perfectly seared and melts in your mouth. The flavor is brilliant.

The service is always friendly. Will come here and invite you to come as well.</text>

< review>
Came here with a wedding party for the rehearsal dinner. We had the entire restaurant and they welcomed us like family and took care of everyone all night in the same way. The food and drink were delicious and the space was perfect for the roughly 30 of us there. Many more and it would have been tight. Classically inspired dishes with their own little bit of flare makes this place unique and everything we had was fantastic. A cute smaller room for a small party of about 8 or fewer is also available.</review>

Terrible service. My wife and I waited to be seated for over twenty minutes while being ignored as the staff/owner chatted up a table of friends, so we went elsewhere. Don't waste your time - there are plenty of other good restaurants in the area that deserve your business.</Text>

I can't believe we've lived in the Marina for 9 years, and had never been to Gamine. We came over for dinner last night, and it was incredible- from the perfectly prepared French dishes, to the wonderful service. This is easily my new favorite restaurant.<//Text>

<resp>None<//resp><review>By far one of the best meals I've had in a very long time. The escargot were perfectly cooked, the goat cheese and arugula salad had a nice balance of texture and flavor, and the pork chop with fingerling potatoes was to-die-for!!! This was the type of meal that leaves you wanting to do it all again even though you're busting at the seams.< /review><Gmap_id>0x808580d073001101:0x23ec21cbadf90dae</Gmap_id>< username>

A cozy little French Bistro with delicious food and an authentic feel.  There is a great space in the back for parties otherwise the front of the restaurant has a cozy feel.  The food was authentic French and very well prepared and presented.  Both the roasted chicken and grilled salmon were excellent.  They are also open for brunch on the weekends.< /Text>

As we move from TripAdvisor to Google guides, our goal as a couple who travels often and have since our early childhoods, is to only share our absolute favorite finds. This is our "go to" place in SF to dine when visiting family and craving French food. Charming setting, try to eat outside for best people watching! Great location!<//Text>

<review>Very good French food. I have been frequenting this spot since I moved to SF five years ago. Steffan, the owner, has done a great job with the place and has come up with a very good menu of rich French foods. The lamb and the hamburger are top notch. I highly recommend this place for smaller groups as it is not very big.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<text>Coming from Europe, this is the first restaurant that I visited in SF, which is not bad. The interior style is quite American to me, but the food selection on the menu seems quite french. Besides, the service is really friendly, and as far as I observed, there are many returning customers. Also, the price is pretty reasonable.< /text>< rate>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I loved this little Marina neighborhood bistro. It was too cold to try their outdoor seating but on a nice day, that'd be a great option. Their food is delicious!  I tried the Ricotta Ravioli with pine nuts and basil. I don't think I've had a better ravioli.  The portions are quite small though, so it's best to order an appetizer. I would definitely go back here.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808580d073001101:0x23ec21cbadf90dae<//gmap_id></record>

Super cozy place with French dishes that are graceful and exceedingly well prepared. The staff is friendly and very attentive. Not your typical overpriced SF joint. We skipped the pasta dishes as they seemed out of place on the appropriately limited menu. The sauteed tilapia was fresh, cooked and seasoned with a gentle hand. Try the beet salad. Brussel sprouts on the side were awesome and the tarte tatin topped off a great meal.<//review>

Great little under the radar French spot on Union. One of my favorite places, usually possible to just drop in without a reservation.

Everything on the menu is perfect, food gets fancier, but it doesn't get better.< /text>

<text>Lively French bistrot with authentic dishes and service! Very nice dinner, lunch and brunch. They don't take bookings but it's usually ok to get a table and wait max 15-20 mins on the busy nights.</text>< Pics>

An incredibly sterile, incredibly loud, neighborhood bistro, with French owners far more concerned about large, vociferous groups they can make money on, than the romantic libertines looking for a quiet bistro to romantically chat. They are very good people, but this is not an intimate, romantic place, by any means.<//text>

I love that place! First the owner is so sweet! Typical french hospitality! The service was very good! Very friendly staff! The atmosphere was so amazing. We went here on a cold december evening. It was very warm in there because there's an open kitchen which I like. You can watch the cooks. It's a very cozy, romantic and small restaurant. It was pretty loud in there. I ate lots of that yummy bread which came before dinner. I had the sauteed Tilapa fish. And it was puuurfect! I loved it! My husband had the roasted chicken which was also very good. The steamed mussels looked amazing but we don't like mussels so we didn't try them but it seemed like people are coming here because of them. Very cute restaurtant!<//Review>

About a year ago, a couple new friends and I stumbled into Gamine for a hearty and rich meal. I felt we strongly bonded over delicious bread, escargot, creamy pasta, buttery scallops, and steak. Unfortunately it was a short lived friendship. It’s just one of those things where you’re too busy, they’re too busy, but it’s really because one of them lives outside of the city and the other outside of the states. I confess that I’m terrible at maintaining friendships outside of my 7 by 7 playground. I’m shitty friend and I digress. Anyways, I had somehow forgotten about this gem until recently which is how my partner and I ended up here for lunch.

I couldn’t resist the beef tartare, and I had the brilliant idea to follow it up with the Crepe Savoyarde. Sometimes I am not a smart woman. The tartare was spicy and packed with onions, capers, and other stuff to hide the fact that you’re eating quality meat. I was extremely disappointed and I would not recommend this dish to anyone.

The Crepe Savoyarde came with prosciutto, brie, béchamel sauce, and topped off with a tomato. Even with the side salad it was too heavy for me. However I freely admit that the tartar had put me in a bad mood and it’s possible I didn’t enjoy my crepe because of that.

My partner ordered the basic burger with gruyere and avocado on a French roll. He liked it, but to me it tasted like a dry version of one of Chez Maman’s burgers.

It was a disappointing lunch but I’m willing to try this place again.</text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It is a French restaurant with reasonable prices and delicious food in the San Francisco (SF) Marina District, with convenient transportation.
There are not many choices of liquor, you can listen to the waiter's suggestions for matching.
Dishes and seafood have their own specialties. The rich French onion cheese soup is very different from the American style. The fast chewing cheese is not acceptable to everyone.
The overall dining environment is acceptable, but the meal is delicious, clean, and fast service; there are many regular customers, and slightly more people at night.

(Original)
是舊金山（SF）海港區（Marina District）價位合理、美味的法式料理餐館，交通方便。
白酒的選擇不多，可聽侍者的建議作搭配。
排餐、海鮮點各有擅長，濃郁法式洋蔥起士湯、跟美式有很大差異，快嚼不動的起士，不是每個人都能接受。
整體用餐環境尚可、但餐點美味、也乾淨，服務速度快；常客頗多，晚上用餐人稍多。< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Great place, cute little French bistro, if you come for a quiet and delicious dinner this is the place for sure.
Quite close to the park, so you can also go on a walk in the park or vice versa.
Also the kind and courteous service of a very pleasant wait staff.

(Original)
מקום מצויין, ביסטרו צרפתי קטן וחמוד, אם בא לכם ארוחת ערב שקטה וטעימה זה המקום בוודאות.
דיי קרוב לפארק אז אפשר גם להמשיך משם לטיול בפארק או להיפך.
כמו כן שירות אדיב ומוימן של צוות מלצרים נעים מאוד.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Very good restaurant when you add more American cuisine. (which can also be good sometimes). I ate a beef bourguignon better than in many restaurants in France. The budget goes hand in hand but we are in a big city and it is not a fast food restaurant. So it is justified. The welcome is nice and for those who are annoyed with the American accent, the waiter makes great efforts to speak French.

(Original)
Très bon restaurant quand on en peu plus de la cuisine Américaine. (qui peut aussi être bonne quelque fois). J'ai mangé un boeuf bourguignon meilleur que dans bien des resto en France. Le budget va de paire mais on est dans une grande ville et ce n'est pas un fast  food. Alors c'est justifié. L'acceuil est sympa et pour ceux qui sont fâché avec l'accent américain, le serveur fait de gros effort pour parler Français.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) A nice discovery last night on Union Street. A warm, intimate restaurant with EXCELLENT homemade dishes.
We spoke with Romuald, who is French and who shared with us a slice of American life. I recommend +++ in particular for the French who stay a few days in the United States and who would like to change Burgers! Good continuation and see you soon !

This little spot has seating but it's always pretty hot in there, so I only do takeout. The food is good, their hot sauce is homemade and extra spicy. My only complaint is that the chicken may be over-brined and can be kind of dry. Otherwise the flavor is good, the potato salad is tasty and the beans always taste fresh out of the pot.</text>

I was impressed. I went there thinking it was the chain Juan Pollo, but it was a locally owned place. The chicken was good, potato salad was good, the rice only blah (buts it's rice anyways). They do have Horchata, but it didn't look homemade (don't know for sure). Overall, great impression will definitely go again.

And the gentleman behind the cash register gets major kudos! He was very nice, encouraging and just a great smile to talk with. Thanks.</text>

Absolutely the worst service ever!!.... I won't ever eat there again and will tell my friends to do the same. I think the ownership changed and the new person running it is just "Rude and don't care", in addition,  the food "Rice, Beans and Potatoe salad tasted old.

I mentioned this to the lady at the register who I really believe is the owner once I began to eat and she said "Sorry" and walked away from me to the back and never returned. I've lived in the area 17years and will be sure to spread the word!! Ended up just throwing the food away!!!</Text>

Was just there a few minutes ago. The service is decent, the food is disgusting I couldn't make myself take a second bite. It looks nasty it smells bland and it tastes nasty. Beans looked a couple days old and it looked like white rice in the burrito which came split open so I had to use a fork . They appeal to the local people here who don't know a lick about Mexican chicken.<//text>

I'll make this quick and simple as we all need to get to munch on that fries in the car.

Parking is not a problem ✅

Drive thru can be packed 🥵

ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING IN YOUR MCDONALD'S BAG BEFORE YOU DRIVE AWAY LIKE A MANIAC ✅

if you want fresh fries, ask for fries without salt. Then just ask for salt packets on the side. ✅✅✅</review>

So disappointed every time I go there they lower their sandwiches quality. First they removed the crispy chiken sadwich and now they gave me this awful chiken sandwich with no lettuce and tomato.</Review>

You're going to read this and think, this HAS to be a joke. I assure you, it's not. I went to this McDonald's on 4/24 to try the new chicken sandwich. I saw signage that said if they didn't offer it to me, I would get a free one on my next visit. They also had a sign up that said their drink machines were all not working so my options were milkshakes, water, and coffee. They had the audacity to still charge $4 for a milkshake. I brushed that off as a corporate policy or whatever.

I pulled around to pay and asked for my free chicken sandwich coupon. The employee in the window said, "We don't do that anymore." He immediately sounded irritated with me and like I was running his day. I get it my guy. I've been in your shoes. I've worked customer service for over a decade in my life.

I informed him that his signage said that the offer was continuing until 4/26. He told me there's nothing he can do about it. I asked for a manager and he said, "Fine I guess I'll check."

A few moments later someone went running out the back door, undoubtedly to take the sign down. The employee returns and says, "This is the best I can do." They handed me a coupon that was: Expired in Dec 2020, unsigned by the manager (which there was space for on the card), and was a BUY ONE get one for an ice cream cone.

I literally laughed as I pulled to the next window. The shake handed to me was the wrong size and by the time I got home, my fries were cold. I should mention, I literally live across the street. There are only a few people who live closer to this site than I do.

I will only be returning to have the manager read this message. Train your staff. Handle yourself properly.< /review>

<rate>1</rate><Text>This McDonalds is pretty bad. Even if you order fries with no salt, they are never crisp and taste like they were fried twice. I hate to throw food away, but they are horrible.
They never get your order right. The sticker on the box clearly says no pickles, but there are definitely pickles on this Big Mac. Save your money.</Text>< pics>

Living in between 3 McDonalds, this is my go to. The prices are the cheapest by far (don't believe me? Go compare with most of the McDonalds in los angeles county).

There is however, the fact that I have received the wrong order about 65% of the time (note, I do mobile orders). Literally never leave until you check your order. There's one manager there that handles things super well and double checks orders before he let's anyone hand it out, so props to him. He's doing way more than he needs to though.

When he's not there...story time!
I ordered 40 nuggets. I received 20.
I had someone argue with me that what she gave me was correct and I only ordered 20. I even had the most recent order on my phone! Manager was called, sees my phone, asks the driver through attendant for the receipt, and she says she lost it. Manager apologies and gets me my order.</review>

Very  frustrated  I was going  to  grab  some  food  for  takeout  but  the  employee  would  not  allow  me  to order any  food  saying  only  serving drive through  I came last week  and  I  was able  to  walk in and  order food  to go  so inconsiderate  be consistent  don't  just  open  and  close lobby  when  you  feel  like  it not everyone  has a car  but  want to give you  business   😡😡😡<//Review>

So apparently of you order sausage mcmuffins without sausage (I am a vegetarian) for their 2 for $4.00 special; you don't get the deal and have to pay full price. You just lost a customer.< /Review>

I tend to waiver such things because it's late night and they are probably tired.  Then it took my order awhile to get ready...in which I let go...it happens.  Then they handed me my food, like of course like I was a dog being fed at a kennel.  The box was drenched with what looks like lube, and it seems as if they pried the box out of someone's butt.   And when I opened the box it looked like it was eaten from within, it was also cold like, with the length I had to wait, it seems as if they used their breath to heat up the burger.  I will let you all know if I get salmonella...or not because I probably retarded from it.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOi4Rsu8XKMYr9cDTkE70EUD73H49Gfi-2j4Yqq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPj3vL0P17Uh4seg5Nc5Qc_GuDwXYrDx97H6DjJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

Not much to say except that it's a good old regular McDonald's, nothing special about it; however, the ice cream machine surprisingly works most of the time!<//Review>

Went to the drive thru and placed my order for family of 5. The order was shown correctly on the receipt but they missed so many items and made items incorrectly. We told them what items were missing, they would give us another bag and there were still items missing. They thought we were lying to get extra food. We got another bag and we thought that everything was there so we drove off and found out we were still missing food. Don't leave the drive thru window without checking if your order is correct... Worst drive thru experience I ever had. Manager should tell the employees to stay off drugs.<//Review>

<Review>This McDonald’s never serves fresh fries, always uses old oil. If you order the buttermilk sandwich you will basically get a mcchicken. The bread is also not fresh. McDonald’s food cooks fast enough for it to always be fresh. I’ve gone to this local McDonald’s for a few years, it’s the worse it’s ever been. Whoever they have managing right now is coasting.. cuz the service and food both suck.</Review>< rating>

Such a bummer. I went through the drive thru with my kids who don’t often eat fast food but love French fries. I was asked if we wanted double French fries instead of apple slices for the happy meals and said yes. I also ordered a crispy chicken meal. We get home to discover the kids fries along with my fries are not there. Seriously the whole reason we went there was for the fries. Now I have to go out and get more because they’re so disappointed. (In n out here, I come)

I’ve tried calling the store and it rings endlessly.< /review>

Worst McDonald's i have ever been too. I had four items on my order and i had to wait 15 minutes.  And when they handed me my order it only had two items. They served 7 people behind me before handing me my other two items. Terrible drive thru, terrible employees, and terrible service. Honestly just go to a different McDonald's even if its a mile or two farther. This McDonald's is horrible!<//review>

I used the self order kiosk, and customized my burger.  I did expect that my order wouldn't come out right, but was pleasantly surprised the order was exactly made! Hats off!, normally other locations mess up my orders.<//text>

Drove ten minutes there. Went in and ordered from the kiosk.
Not busy at all; almost empty restaurant.
I left, drove ten minutes to my house with my kid, sat down for dinner only to find out my kids' 10-piece mcnuggets were not in the order.
My bigmac tasted like rubber and was COLD.
My two large fries orders were COLD.
I pulled out the receipt to call.
I called 7+ times over a ten-minute period and the line just kept ringing busy.

I heated my burger and fries and fed the kids and I stayed hungry. McDonalds kept my money.

Sad. Absolutely sad.

Never again. I'd rather starve or eat cup noodles than give this corporation another cent.< /review>

I have gotten their Filet Of Fish Sandwich at this location a few times with no problems. But tonight I bought 2 fish sandwiches which were extremely over cooked and barely edible! Someone needs to check into why their quality is going downhill. Thank you.<//text>

I come to this McDonald’s to eat & do a little work. Customers aren’t loud, there aren’t kids running around, & WiFi is great!!

Nice sitting area outside too. Definitely a great McDonalds to visit!!< /Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< user_id>

Most likely one of the best McDonald's I've been to. It's chill, the people are great, my food is always good, I like the area it's in, the only issue for me is the access. The parking lot is really small and if more than 3 people are waiting at the drive thru my car gets blocked in.<//Text>

A typical McDonald's with an LA Vibe. Orders aren't processed as efficiently as out in New York City but still fine and well served. The staff are friendly but somewhat forgetful of giving dip sauces, ketchup and miscellaneous.</Review>

Super friendly staff; fries a pleasant shock, redolent of fresh cooking oil; sandwich surprisingly fresh and tasty, and correct on custom order.

Don't know if it's luck or if this location is just that good, but this meal was great.</Review>< pics>

So I went to this McDonald's which I ordered a bacon double quarter pounder with cheese and the burger didn't have the bacon and when I went to the register to tell them I got an attitude from the cashier but he still corrected their error but still it was only 5 out if 10 stars so a okay experience.</text>< Rating>

<resp>None<//resp><text>I left a review about a year ago giving this McDonald's 3 stars. I literally had to come and update this, it deserves less than a star. They had 11 employees behind the counter (I counted), only 3 customers and it still took 20 mins to get my order. Not sure if the owners care about the profitability of their establishment. Maybe they own to many to notice.<//text>< Pictures>

Just bought two fish sandwiches got home and they are the worst sandwiches I've ever not eaten. I could not eat them! Hardly any sauce, lukewarm, hard crunchy stale buns.Somebody has to look into this McDonald's and the poor food quality. I will never eat there again.</Review>

This McDonald’s has a very quick drive thru. One challenge sometimes is that the cars in the drive thru line block the parking lot and there is a line just trying to get into the lot.< /Text>

<text>It's McDonald's. There really isn't much more to say than that. It's got your standard McDonald's Fair which never varies from restaurant to restaurant. Literally it's always the same. The prices are pretty much the same everywhere except if you go to one of the expensive ones like in Hollywood or inside of an amusement park. This place has decent Decor, it's a nice area Burbank. The store is always clean the staff members are always friendly, there really isn't anything to complain about. The drive-thru is open 24 hours. I go here after 4 and during work off of it<//text>< response>

Forget ordering at the kiosks the are a gimmick...

I debated on going to a nice place for dinner where a good meal would be about $15... But I wanted to save money... So I thought.    A couple fish sandwiches and undercooked fries and a coke....  Over $13 .horrible meal for the money.    And it was not FAST<//Review>< pics>

<text>A little guilty pleasure..McDs is clean efficient and open late night. This time I wanted a no fuss snack. If you order a filet o fish lettuce wrap, (it's not on the menu, but they are prepared with giant fresh dark green lettuce leaves and deli wrap) I like mine with the tartar sauce, but no weird cheese. You can get two for $5 ...and can still pretend you're eating healthier.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2c00515120d87:0x5688115dd343e685</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

What a nice McDonald's! It was more like a restaurant with so many booths than a traditional McDonalds and the McCafes are delicious! Friendly service also!</Text>

They taste so horrible it was stale and tasted horrible. I would go back o get fresh new ones but I don’t drive. Who can I speak with to handle this problem<//text><Name>kristy Rivera</Name></record>

<username>Ed Samaniego< /username><Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>This place has enough employees but there was no ice on both sides of the fountain drinks. I asked for no cheese or onion on my two burgers and I got cheese and onion on them. I also said it was for here she asked. But she didn't give me a number so that she could bring it to the table I ask her don't you need to give me a number? She said no that she will remember. I said okay when to the table and waited and waited no food.!!!
So I had to go out there and ask them were is my order? They said someone must have tooken the order or we called out the number and no one came. I said I had it for here and they told me they will bring it to my table.
Anyways again lots of employees but extremely bad service.</review><Response>None< /Response>< Rate>

Hit or miss.  Sometimes the service is great and sometimes it's slow.  Doesn't seem to be based on peak times either.  Always faster to go in than wait for the drive-thru< /Text>

moving or capable of moving at high speed.
"a fast and powerful car"

(Hoping the employees read this.) JK the employees are ok, the management is simply awful. Slow, slow, slow. 20 min wait time is normal even when there's not a line. Proof that McDonalds must be desperate for help.</review>

<text>Horribly rude manager...didn't care to get her name but she wore a white shirt, dark hair and drives a white prius...and wears too much make up. Any ways I asked a simple question and got barked at like I was child that had done something terribly wrong. I have never been so humiliated and embarrassed by a lowly McDonald's employee. I will obviously not be returning until she no longer works here. All of the other employees were very nice and apologized for her harsh uncalled for reaction.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c00515120d87:0x5688115dd343e685</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I order a grilled chicken sandwich combo,
Paid for it, get up to the drive thru waiting for food, guy tells me to wait in parking spot and they'll bring it out to me. Wait for almost 15 minutes , so I decide to call and talk to manager and she says she's out on break and another manager was working. I told her to refund me the money and for m not happy waiting here for one frickin grill chicken combo. They did this before and I didn't complain the first time.i will never come back to this location ever again. Worse McDonald's ever, don't waste your time.< /Review><Rate>1</Rate><userid>110336061922848466861< /userid><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_name>

Typical McDonald's. The employees could use a training course (or 2) in customer service. There were literally at least 8 employees standing behind the counter and over in the drive thru area...all of them chatting and not helping any customers...yet I still waited 20 mins to get a caramel frappe. That's just inexcusable when you have an overabundance of employees and no line of customers. I should have been out of there in 10 mins max.<//text>

Be careful using the app to order. I had the unfortunate circumstance to wait in the pickup spot for 15 mins watching 10 cars go through drive thru before they brought the food. This was after going through drive thru and the staff not having the order.< /review>

Still wondering why I can get a large soda for a dollar but a bottle of water half the size is $1.39? And why if I ask for cheese they charge me more but if I say no cheese the don't charge me less?< /text>

Its macdonalds. Why are you reading a review on macdonalds? If you dont care about your diet you shouldnt care about online reviews. Clean and safe and the people are nice which helps compensate for my fleeting lack of self respect.< /review>

<review>I rarely go here, but every time I do I'm reminded why I don't want to go here. It's unhealthy food to begin with, but the service is always bad. They are inattentive, they get the order wrong, then they fill it wrong, then they forget what condiments you wanted. They do make change well, though, so I gave them a star for that.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

They call the place 24 hours but workers are not really work after 2am orders take 15 to 20 min even when there is no line in drive through and in the end your order is wrong I pay extra for Guacamole and cheese but they didn’t put and the guy tell his friend he came back they think at 3 am no one ganne come back for no cheese after 12 years I will never go that place< /Text>
