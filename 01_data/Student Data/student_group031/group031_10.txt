They check your tires for free and offer all kinds of service for a low price. They have served my family for quite some time and never disappoint.</review>

This is not the highest end tire shop, they will use mostly trolley jacks to lift your car, but they are very attentive, provide good and affordable services. English and Spanish is spoken. They do complete tire service, alignment (they do have a lifter for that) and brake service as well.< /Review>

<review>At first I was ok with this tire shop. It was recommended from a friend. I will say it's more expensive from the one I usually go to. But I gave it a try because it was closer to home. When one of my tires was damaged beyond being able to patch I went in for the road hazard warranty rams tires stated came with my tire purchase. So the owner told me I needed to pay for a new tire and I would get a call back 30 days after the supplier assessed the damage tire with an invoice and a reimbursement amount. It has now been close to 60 days. I have been trying to call rams tires 2-3 times a day and always get the same answer. I'm told that the owner is not there to call at a later time. One of the employees actually took my number down and said she would get back to me that same day. It has now been 4 days since then and about 10 more calls with the same answer. I think even the employees are getting tired of hearing my voice. One employee told me just come down here. If I am always told she isnt there why should I take the time out of my busy day to get the same answer. This is the worst customer service from any business. At least have the common decency to return a phone call.< /review>< pics>

You should change you closing time to “6:30” if you’re going to turn down paying customers that expect it to close at 7. I get it, but pretty ridiculous RAMS, get your stuff together. You definitely just lost a loyal customer, not that you care of course.<//Text>

< Review>
This place was fast and had excellent service. I needed a tire checked and thought it had a nail, but the guy said it was only low on air which he added. He could've easily said it needed repairs but was honest and helpful. I always prefer smaller shops like this, bcuz I have gone to corporate tire places where they've lied and were dishonest just trying to push new tires on every customer.
Highly recommend this place.</Review>

While this place replaced my lower control arms without a problem, they did not provide PROOF of having completed the front-end alignment I also had to pay for. If I don't get a copy of this, I may have to have this shop investigated by CA BAR!< /text>

If you want great service Conner down to rams tires not only are they friendly but I was met out front and helped right away. They found a alternative I will do all my business here for now on thanks rams tire for being one of the better shops in redlands I will highly recommend to everyone.< /Review><Response>None</Response><rate>5<//rate>< user_id>

Excellent service! I got a flat tire on Big Bear on Sunday so due to they don't have Tire Shops open I needed to buy a Fix a Flat  can and go down to San Bernardino on Monday. I went different places but they wanted to sell me a pair of tires.
When I came to Ram's they fixed the tire, removed the screw in 10 mins!! best 10 Dlls. invested! Thanks again guys. Fully recommend this place!!!</text>

First impression was not good, based on the outside of the building。
2nd impression was lousy, based on the menu.
Then orders were made. Wait & see.
Food brought in and "WOW": Taste was great, the food had a special ''Chinese food flavor - 鍋味'' that I had not had since leaving Chicago.
Try it, you will love the flavors and the quality of the food.

Great service and food! Tea was ready to serve upon arrival. Family style dishes, come hungry. I ordered two dishes. House special crunchy noodles and popcorn chicken (chicken and basil) came along with shark soup and pickled cabbage.<//Text>

This is THE place to get duck. They offer whole duck either standard or Peking style (deboned, steamed buns, etc).<//text>

This place rocks! D-lishousness all up & down the menu.  I have been to many Chinese restaurants throughout Southern California and this hole in the wall is one of a kind.     I have been here with my fiancee & our little one of 7 years.      So far we have sampled their Crispy noodle Chow mein *all styles*,  Fried rice *all styles*, Wonton noodle soups *roasted duck/BBQ-pork*, Chinese broccoli with garlic, Bok-choi with garlic, Mao po tofu,  Fried Chicken *appetizers* Egg Rolls,  Salt & Spicy Jumbo Shrimp *tapioca battered* (a must try),
Roasted Duck, BBQ-pork, General Tsao's Chicken.
It gets busy and packed all the time so arrive early with a big appetite. They have excellent service and will accommodate your every salivatory needs.
We will be back for the rest of the menu, til then I am most sure whatever you decide to sample, you won't be disappointed.
Enjoy!</review>

Walked in for take-out order Sunday noon, the house was full as expected. The lady at the counter offered me a hot soup while waiting for my order to come in. That's nice of her! Thank you ... My first time here and will be back soon.</review>

I have seen this place for many years, but never remember it when I want to eat out. Don't let the exterior put you off!!  It is a very small building, not impressive at all. The food is really good, very large portions!! Because the portions are large, the price seems a smidge higher, but well worth it!! It was kinda crowded on a Sunday night at 7 pm. Quite a few people there for takeout.<//review>

<text>Small mom and pops authentic Taiwanese style food. Even though appearance can throw someone off, going inside its cozy and feels like you walked into a restaurant in Taiwan. Food is amazing and they give you more than enough food for the price. Definitely worth checking it out. One of the few restaurants I visit when I'm in town.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>Tiny place, but excellent food.

Don't let the name fool you. You can get traditional Chinese cuisine here, not just BBQ.

A-1 has been around for 20+ years and still going strong. It's a small place but the food has always been excellent.

If you want a taste of some of the most authentic Chinese food, all served in the South Bay, then A-1 Chinese BBQ is a place you should check out.</Text>< pics>

<review>I absolutely love this food. The food is wonderful, good portions,tasty and reasonably priced. The salt and pepper pork chops here are the best, and so are the wonton soups.
The dining area is a bit small,and tends to be crowded at times, so I order my food to go.
It is clean inside,and staff is friendly, helpful.</review>< pictures>

I've been eating at A1 for many years.  Have always enjoyed the food.  This evening my family of 5 came for dinner to celebrate my birthday January 29, 2020 at 5pm.   My mother arrived with my brother first, the older Chinese lady whom I've not seen here before didn't say one word to my mom or brother, she was obviously in a bad mood.
My mother informed her that we were going to be a party of 5 and asked for more menus to which the lady just ignored.
When I walks in my mother was telling me the lady/waitress was not in a good mood.  Well the lady/waitress came over and started telling my mom she didn't know what she was talking about, that she never said anything to her and basically started laying into my mom.
I asked the lady to stop, she kept going, so I said that's it and got up and we all left and went to Szechwan Chinese Restaurant across the street instead.  Enjoyed a wonderful huge meal, we spent $220 on food alone.  Also, no attitude.  I will no longer be coming to A1 any more due to this ladies attitude.</Text>

<review>I can’t comment for the quality of the food but the Service was so terrible that I had to leave. I went in at 11:45 for a birthday lunch for 3. The owner lady took a look at us and around and proceeded to tell us there aren’t any space for us. She had an attitude as if we weren’t worth her time. I guess we weren’t, considering she was saving the larger tables for a party of 9 that would come in an hour. I was ready to leave then. The waiter though seemed eager for our business. So he set up another table for us in the middle of the room. There was a table of 1 behind us and they told us then that once that person leaves they would move us back so we would have a bit more room which we were ok with. Then a party of 2  came in and to keep their business, the waiter arranged for them to be seated at the table we were at and we were to move back as the guy leaves. As we were doing this exchange we saw one of the chair at the back table was broken so we move it to the side planning to sit on the chairs that we have been sitting. The waiter came over and go out of his way to take the good chair that we were already sitting on away saying it was a spare chair and not for use and told us to use the broken one. Then I proceeded to watch him to give that same ‘not for use spare’ chair to the party of 2!!!! Was I not good enough to sit on the good chair?! Why would you even give your customer the broken chair when you had a perfectly good one available! I was so angry that I decided I wasn’t going to take anymore this and left altogether. This is a small, unsanitary, and all around horrible restaurant so don’t waste your time here. There are better options in Torrance.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

The food is good, but the owner is quite rude. Twice, I've had issues with her. The first,  we ate in the restaurant, the food was good (ordered wor won ton soup which is pretty good!, kung pao shrimp, Mongolian beef, combination fried rice plus other dishes), when our group was all done, we asked for the check. Used one credit card to pay for the full check and we left cash for the tip. The owner came to pick up the signed receipt and said "no tip?"...we pointed to the cash on the table. The second time, I called in an order to go, I showed up to pick it up and asked for plenty of hot sauce as there were about 6 to 8 entrees in our order. She only wanted to give me 3 little containers, I told her that wasnt enough for the order we placed. She would not give me more, so I asked how much for 3 more, she charged me $1 per small container of hot sauce. I would have left the food and gone elsewhere, however, we had an event and I needed the food. I'm sure this review doesn't affect the owner in any way, she will continue to act rude, show lack of logic and have no basic customer service. You have been warned.</text>

This is one of the best kept secrets among Chinese - Tawain restaurants in the South Bay. Try the roast duck and the fish fillets in black bean sauce. My favorite dish is the Shanghai short ribs. Nobody does it better in the US. Very small place.</Text>

Great Taiwanese food! Stir fried dishes are super tasty. I like the mu shu pork, general tso, pork chop rice, noodles also on point. Always fresh.<//Review>

Looking from the outside, you wouldn't think much of this place. The inside is clean and the staff here is friendly. I took out dinner. I was very happy with the quality of food period I would definitely come back here again and even dine in the next time.< /text>

My girlfriend and I are originally from Taiwan, and we agree this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in L.A.! She even drives from Anaheim to enjoy A-1's excellent cuisine.<//Text>

And plenty authentic down to the tiny parking lot and cheap tables.<//text>< Response>

<text>You neighborhood hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant that you probably never knew existed or even if you knew existed was too hesitant to go in because of the darkened windows... But really not,  this place is legit when it comes to Chinese food. Like any legit Chinese restaurant, while I thumbed up/smiley'ed the service be aware that you if it's busy the opener lady isn't going to look happy - but no worries, she's really nice and quite a hoot even with that demeanor haha. As for the atmosphere, well it got an A rating for cleanliness at least haha. But yes, on to the main point - the food. Like I said their food is very authentic Chinese and they also cater to Japanese clientele (as noticeable by the Japanese in their menu). I highly recommend coming here to eat in or take out, especially their giant pork meatball.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>(Translated by Google) It’s delicious, I can’t help but let me eat 5 bowls of rice. I can really come to this store to eat. The seat is a little less. If there are more guests, I will need to wait. But this is a shop that people will wait and will not be disappointed.

好吃 忍不住讓我吃了5碗飯  真的可以來這間店吃 位子稍微少了點 若是客人多會需要等一下 但這是讓人等了也不會失望的店</text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) The taste of the dishes is not bad, there are many guests at noon.

The place is easy to operate. The $2 dollar after 11pm special is cash only though so keep that in mind. Haven't had an issue with it so far<//Review>

Awesome car wash. Pressure was strong, and there was tons of soap and foam. Air dryer was also very strong. Bays were clean and there were lots of them. High quality self car wash.<//Text>

<Review>UPDATE:

The charge made on my card reverted to $4 after it was closed out. If you use a card, it puts a hold of $13 on it. It's insane they do that, but I wish they had signs at the machine stating this.

Hence, I've updated the rating based on my experience actually washing my car

DO NOT GO HERE.

I needed to wash my car due to sap hitting my windshield and some of my hood so I looked for a place to do a quick wash (should have read the reviews). I pulled into the bay and saw they took card, so I decided to just swipe my card due to ease rather than cash.

They promote themselves as being $2.50 for 4 minutes, which is a fair price. I took 8:30 minutes to wash my car since it was just the sap issue.

Upon reviewing my credit card, they charged double! I would love to see the security footage of me "washing" my car for 20+ minutes as the $13.00 doesn't make any sense.

They are super deceptive and will definitely be reporting them to the BBB and the chase fraud department.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvKlnb6hDrv3mbxPbBu8AhyfSLJ2-eEaDA-_NW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Night care wash only $2. It's cheap but used to be half price. You usually have one spot open. It is rare that you have to wait.</text>

Best car wash I used in the valley so far, bays are usually atocked up pretty well, plus the night special is a plus especially if you like to go out late for a wash, vaccuum has pretty good suction, car always leaves this place spotless<//Text>

I would've gave it 5 star rating but they just recently raised their $1.00 night special to $2.00. I really hope they go back to the $1.00 night special soon. But everything else is exceptional the water pressure is great, the place is kept clean, all the machines work fine & the atmosphere is fantastic. I would definitely recommend this car wash to anyone who has a car.< /Review>< Rating>

<Review>This place is great. Went after 5pm and $5 got me 10 full minutes. Very clean, lots of washing bays, excellent water pressure, and all of the brushes seemed new. They even have an air dry hose. I’ll definitely go back again.<//Review><userid>107326213276382838653< /userid><Gmap_id>0x80c296ec3ea9fd01:0x5171b03ee16be1db<//Gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

I returned from a trip up north and my car was FILTHY; my front window was full of bug guts.  All the regular car wash places were closed due to COVID-19, so, I had to use a coin-operated car wash and wash the car myself.  I researched reviews and found this place.  I had never been here before so I had to study all of the wash cycles and amenities available.  One no-no is to use your own bucket; they have adequate signs with rules posted.  I used all wash/rinse/and protective coating cycles available: a total of 8.  Each cycle cost $2 for 4 minutes.  I have a mid-sized/4-door sedan style car and 4 minutes was enough time.  I did bring my own mitt/sham for extra cleaning and rubbing in the suds.  I thought there was a lot of suds and that the brushes worked very well.; the water pressure was excellent and the facility itself is kept very clean. The hot air blower helped tremendously to get rid of the large water spots and helped me to dry the car faster overall; I only used one towel to dry the entire car.  I was in the stall for a good 30 minutes with no pressure to hurry up and move along.  After I completed the final rinse, I pulled forward to wipe down the car and wash my windows. The wash brushes available cleaned up the bug guts on the front window and front bumper.  There is a vacuum but I did not use it; other people were using them and I could tell that the vacuums had a lot of power.  I am not sure how much they cost.   My car was sooo clean afterwards and I was very satisfied.  I will use this car wash again.  Finally, they take quarters and credit cards and there is a change machine on site.  I counted 8 stalls.</text>

I spent 5 minutes of PAID time, untangling their hoses because the nozzles were getting caught on each other and falling everywhere.  A simple car wash took me almost 11 minutes. I kindly asked for a partial refund or credit for $3 for my time spent, and the manager refused. He said it wasn't his fault they were tangled, and it's people like me that come in and tangle it up.

So now, instead of giving me a $3 credit, they're getting a bad review on every platform. Worth it?<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

The soaps and waxes are super good too. I'll find myself driving across town just to go to this wash. Theres even a presoak foam gun, and a handheld blow dryer (think reversed vaccum). Shout out to the owner for running such a great wash!

<Review>Came here after visiting three other places that were packed, and so glad I did. $2 for about 4.5 minutes! The soap and brush combo had a pretty soft brush, but it was enough to get all the gunk off my car after driving from Colorado Springs, CO. Vacuuming is $1 for around 5 min as well. Good suction from the vacuum, too, as I only spent $2 to vacuum my car when it had loads of dog hair. Well worth it!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Great place to wash your car even after 11pm its $1 dollar wash. The equipment is very good and well taken cared of. However, dont like how their staff onsite can be very rude to those waiting for an available car wash room to be free when it gets busy that's my only issue or else wouldve been 5 stars.< /text>

I hated the maintenance man that was their  cleaning.  my fiancé went to wash  his work car and FYI it’s old the older gentleman started picking on us thinking that we were asking for money when I was changing  a 10 dollar bill in the machine.  Appearances are deceiving. We were offended and very disgusted by his behavior.<//review>

<Review>Unprofessionally handles complaints about tenants issues. One sided as a flat-foot-flake. Will not address issues when addressed, only will address if it has to deal with us or certain tenants. As a minority in the park we are respectful and keep to ourselves, but we dont get the same in return.< /Review><rating>1</rating><time>1579373708823< /time><Gmap_id>0x80db68a66bc2b091:0xac88ff4837a81fe8</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I'm a 10+ year round resident. I find this place to be very affordable and friendly. It's quiet in the summer and in the winter is very lively when all of my snowbird friends come. It's a great place to live.</Review>< Pics>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>(Translated by Google) It was a good place to live, the income from the spaces was good, now it has risen 30%. I do not know if it is legal to make that increase year after year of 30%. That is an abuse for my personal enblo.
Oh trash all over the streets behind the houses I don't know if it's good or call the fire department since the manager of that trash has been told many times.
They put solar panels for the benefit according to the tenants but far from the benefit they now charge us for using those parking lots that should be public, the light never lowered the bill, so there is no benefit.
In short, the new administration that there is now is not the least bit helpful for me.
They tell me that I am the only one who complains, I say I will be the only one who has the courage to do it, or the most stupid person who gets angry just to do it because no matter how much one complains, in any way nothing will change.

(Original)
Era un buen lugar para vivir la renta de los espacios era buena ahora la an subido el 30% no se si sea legal hacer ese incremento año tras año del 30% eso es un abuso para mi enblo personal.
Ay basura por todas las calles por detras de las casas no se si sea bueno o llamar a los  bomberos ya que se le a dicho muchas veces a la manager de esa basura.
Pusieron paneles solares para beneficio segun de los inquilinos pero lejos del beneficio ahora nos cobran por usar esos parkings que deverian ser publicos la luz jamas nos bajo el bill asi que no hay beneficio alguno.
En fin la nueva administracion que ahora hay no es ni un poquito servicial para mi.
Me dicen que soy el unico que me quejo yo digo sere el unico que tiene el valor de haverlo o el mas pendejo que hago corajes solo por hacerlos porque no importa cuanto se queje uno de cualquier forma no cambiara nada.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

It is nice to see the manager cleaning and disinfecting the high traffic areas.  They even have signs in multiple languages on how to properly clean clothes and reminders of social distancing.</text>

Great place to get your laundry done. I really appreciate the new and upgraded washer and dryers. Thet really get the job done. The owner is very friendly and the young lady cleaning up does a great job at keeping this facility clean. Been coming here for a few years now and will continue to do my laundry.</text>

Very bad service, can't get change to wash without being asked if you are there to take their change. Then the lady is following you for the entire 2 hrs you are there to see what you are doing, Definantly will never go there again.</review>

<Review>this place sucks!!! all of the machines are always broken. and the ones that work take all of your money! we literally tried 4 different machines and they stopped taking our money after we only needed to add .50 cents! and even after we added the 50 cents it didn’t take it. and the other ones took the money then after a few seconds asked us to pay again! and we tried to call the number on the wall but no one picked up! never again! there are better places with actual machines that work</Review></record></dataset><record>

The last time I went the washing machine took my money and didn't start washing. The worst part is that there is no one there to help or refund the money. There's no phone number either. I've spent more money on the machine without it doing any washing.< /review>< Pics>

Worst Laundry Ive ever been to... Every load I washed looked like it hadnt been cleaned... I used 3 of the 3.25 loads and one of the 1.75 load... I wash my color clothes in cold to keep their color bright but that option wasnt available for one of the 3.25 loads and i had to choose hot after about 5 minutes of it running and not filling up with water... I had to rewash the load because it did not wash properly... Wasted my soap and money... Rosa who works there said to call the number but i didnt waste my time because i wont be coming back... Very Dirty w/ used dryer sheets all over every part of the floor... The Homeless is aloud to sleep inside on the benches where patrons should have available for sitting... TVs were present but not functioning... 50 cents to dry one small load fully... Management have no type of pride in their buisness... If you can go somewhere else i suggest it because i wouldnt waste my coins her again... Only plus is that its 24 hours...<//Text>

< review>
Most of the equipment here is old and problematic, and the place looks tired and worn down. Washing machine #D4 is out of order, but there's no sign on it. It is clearly blocked to prevent people from putting coins in, but I already wasted washing detergent for nothing. And one of the two dryers I used #A42 was broken and I lost money. Any business that steals from me gets one star. No phone number to to call to report either. Shame on you sunshine coin laundry. Not an appropriate way to treat the customers who pay your salaries. P.S. All the signs are in Chinese and Spanish. No English. This is the United States you asshats, not China or Mexico. Have some decency and respect for the people who were born in this country.<//review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>Non-operativible machines are taking over.  You'll see more tags that says "out of order" than you will see a reliable, and I use the term loosely, machines.

You will be lucky finding dryers' machines when the place has a good number of customers and when you do, your clothes will be over cooked and coming off smelling funny unless you turn the knob to medium which will take more quarters.

Not my first choice to visit but it's the most convenient place.  Also, homeless people come by at times and Jehovah's witnesses.

I still come here because I got nowhere else to go, I'll deal with the negatives for a bit longer.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>So many broken one here that I'm surprised that this business is still alive! 5 or 6 out of 10 are *out of order* here, and you don't see them coming here to fix it. What's worse is that when you put in the coins ( like $3.25 or $4.50) and that the washer doesn't have any water, and that you've wasted money and time for nothing.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>Phenomenal staff, affordable menu and quick service!
The meat lovers pizza was cheesy, full of toppings and crispy on the crust making it a perfect, unforgettable lunch.
The garlic bread was fresh and had the perfect ratio of herbs and butter, to top it all off was the dynamic marinara sauce which I found to be the best I've had outside of Europe.
Will definitely be back!<//review>< username>

<Review>I absolutely love the pizza here.  As an implant to California I missed being able to get pizza easy but since moving to Glendale I've finally found some pizza that I really enjoy. It absolutely reminds me of that damn good pizza joint in every town in the Midwest. It's my go to during lockdown when I need a cheesy pick me up.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Wanted a quick eat and stumbled upon this gem. The service was fast and efficient with no wait time to be serviced.  The pizza was absolutely DELICIOUS. The crust was light and crispy with the perfect amount of cheese and pepperoni. Anyway, I be back for a large next time around!< /Text>

<text>I had Chicken Supreme Sandwiches that shared with family. It was a HIT. Everyone seems to like it. To me, that is a WIN. I am looking forward trying other sandwiches. Also, I always liked their pizzas as well.< /text>< name>

<review>Tried ALL the pizza joints up and down Glenoaks.  This place beats them all.  Opinion is not just my own, I have a tribe that critiques the pizzas.  Although others were good, this pizza met ALL the expectations of the tongue.  What Pizza Pie has down is their dough.  It’s ALMOST perfect.  TWO THUMBS UP.< /review>< UserId.>

Terrible management. If they get your order right 1 out of 5 times you are lucky. If you only have to wait 15 minutes after the pickup time they give you, you are lucky.  Do not be surprised if you show up and they don't have your order at all.  If you like taking chances, this is your place. Don't bother, lots of other choices.< /Text>

<text>Stopped by on a visit to LA.  Found this place online.   Lady behind the counter was really nice.  This guy making food was also super nice.   Pizza was good. XL pizza and 12 wings was only $24, not bad.  I would visit here again if I happen to be in the area.</text><Pics>None</Pics><rate>5<//rate>< Gmap_id>

Not the biggest fan of the "cold" pizzas but the pepperoni and the deluxe never disappoints.<//review>< Time>

< review>
I got a pizza com here today for my first time that had white sauce, chicken, spinach, mushroom, and feta and i must say this pizza rocked my mouth. The crust is a in between of thick and thin and it's just right for a pizza. The establishment is exceptionally clean from a customers point of view and you can see the entire process from dough to finish product at work. I love some good pizza and now I'm down the street so i will be back plenty more times to come. Whatever you guys are doing keep up the consistency and the great costumer service. 😎😀😅☝</review>

Delicious slice of pizza and garlic bread. I had the margarita and my friend had the pepperoni. The slices are HUGE!! Like 4 times the size of a regular slice. They tasted delicious and I will definitely come back!</review>

Best gluten-free pizza I've ever had, at least the BBQ chicken one. I tried it at a laser game birthday party my son was invited to attend (and me) in Glendale, and I couldn't stop eating it, and I'm not a big pizza person. My son has a play date in Glendale this afternoon / evening, so I'm going to order more for tonight. Can't wait.</Review>

These guys are awesome, from the drivers to the staff/mgmt. I messed my order up and they still fixed it, even though it was my fault. Things like this is why we always order from here. It's rare to find such good customer service these days....oh, and their prices are very reasonable too.</Review>

Definitely not the best. Maybe they were having an off day. There seemed to be literally no sauce on the pizza, the dough was very tough, really would not order again. Sorry guys.</review>

The Daily Brew is no longer! New name: Balrog. Very quiet during the noon hour 🦉 only 1 other customer besides me.
Barista was very nice and helpful. They don't have Mexican chocolate anymore so he suggested their chocolate which they "make themselves". It was Fabulously tasty!
The multicolored piano is gone 😯 so don't know if there is anymore music in the evenings.
Very clean establishment.<//text>

<Text>Great tomales to be had here! The iced mocha was a little sweeter than I normally like but not Starbucks sugar level. I also had a cheese danish which was great & my wife enjoyed a bagel.

I love the chill, laidback vibe of this place. They also have talent nights there and unique coffee drinks to explore and try out. I went with one of my very good friends during midday and it was so quiet and chill. Great place for the coffee of course, as well as the atmosphere, and talent nights...< /Review>

Had their regular hot chocolate and it was delicious. Wilson the barista was courteous and helpful. The only thing I didn't like was the manager was rushing me because they were going to have a comedy show. I wasn't able to enjoy my hot chocolate and sandwich<//review>

I have been there 3 times since they opened.  I met the owners and they are great people!  My favorite is the "Almond Joy"  coffee - yum!  yum!

Can you believe they have a chorizo scone!!  The decor is great and they even have a piano.  Stop by and enjoy a good cup of coffee and some good music too!  The staff is friendly.

I will be going back often.

Virginia  :)</review>

<review>Great coffee shop ambiance. A good comfortable place to study although the WiFi is spotty sometimes. I have a feeling they are using home Internet instead of business Internet because it seems to be effected by the number of users on the WiFi. The pastries and the sandwiches are also pretty good.<//review>< Pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) This place is both a cafe and a bar. Sometimes they have programs like karaoke and comedy at this shop. When I go in the morning and the shop has just opened, the owner of the shop is friendly and polite, and they tell me that every time it opens at 8:30 in the morning, but when I arrive, it is less than 8 o'clock. However, the owner also made the coffee I ordered. The price is a bit expensive and the taste is not much better than other places. Most importantly, the service atmosphere is friendly and feels like a coffee shop in the village, which is different from us drinking Starbucks coffee.

I've been to El Salvador, I think this place does pupusas even better! Friendly authentic Salvadoran food. I love the horchata too and the empanada was great! I was really impressed and glad I found this excellent place on a whim while stuck in Oakland for a few hours.<//Text>

Just came through here heading home to Atwater,Ca today ordered pupusas for the family and I they were straight fire. Had to roll back twice to get seconds. The salsa and coleslaw mix is on point. I recommend this spot to anyone hit it up.</text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Went there and placed an order for 30 pupusas. I asked the owner if it would have been better for me to have called the order in because it might take awhile. He told me that it was better to order them and get them fresh. So I sat down and waited and watched the women do their thing. They were like machines. And I mean that as a compliment. In less than 15 minutes, all 30 were done, piping hot. The owner even helped me load up the car. Took them straight to a potluck and everyone loved them. Kids, teens and adults. Will be going back frequently. Asked the owner how long they've been in business. He told me only 9 months. Here's to making sure that they're around for a lot longer.< /Text>< pics>

Do not expect that you will receive what you order.  We placed an order for 3 burritos. All were something other than what the order specified.  I believe they just throw anything in a tortilla and ship it out.  How does a bean burrito containing cheese, pico de gallo and cilantro, turn into a burrito with beans rice, carrots, cucumbers and what seems to be tofu.  Amazing.  Never again.<//review>

These pupusas are delicious! They made them very quickly! Each one was individually wrapped in foil so they wouldn't stick together and I appreciated that very much. They are delicious, cheap, and made with care. Best pupusas in California.<//Text>

<Name>Robert Mendoza</Name><text>Your greeted when you walk in. Food is good what a Salvadorian dish should be. Taste I guess it just depends on who is the cook for the day noticed different flavor on the batch but it is home cook meals not a fast food restaurant so expect a wait. Good location for a Pupuseria tried only a few dishes but overall good food. Maintenance needs to be kept up. Floor needs to be maintained often.</text><Resp>None<//Resp>< rating>

Decided to try this new place. Not really authentic Pupusas. They are more like Salvadorean Pupusas with Mexican ingredients. They use pinto beans instead of black beans, the cheese they use isn't good quality cheese, and there ingredients proportion is off. I ordered revueltas and I might have well has gotten a bean and cheese because there was no chicharron in mine. Tasted like they used canned beans and not fresh ones. The best thing I liked was the Jamaica drink. Also, when we asked for Salvadorean Horchata, they only had Mexican Horchata which only confirmed they are not authentic.. The chips and Salsa were okay but the salsa tasted like it was also from a can and I could tell it was going bad. The curtido was additionally not good, needed more oregano and you can tell they used canned pickled jalapenos.<//Text>

Delicious food, not to mention authentic! The restaurant is quite big and has plenty of seating. They have so many options for pupusas and their other dishes look amazing. The pupusas are freshly made and super flavorful. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of their menu.< /Text>

BEST PUPUSAS in Oakland. I love this location, i usually order to go and the food is always great and ready when i pick it up. Dining in is also a great experience the service is good. I've only had the pupusas but all their other dishes always smell and look good, i definitely visit frequently.</text>

< Review>
Love fast charging, and love the morning discount.  If I eat at the Denny's, I can be above 95% charge when I come out. Just wish Denny's coffee wasn't so weak for the price.  Wish there were a Peet's here instead of a Starbucks<//Review>

< Review>
So far so good!  Denny’s is right across the street!  It was clean but kinda dark and we were the only ones there!  Scared me a bit because a car was on in the parking lot across; with all the break ins it make me nervous!

Very convenient when shopping at gilroy outlet. Close to dinneys as well. Only 4 stars as the some of the chargers are not maintained and I have always parked on a non working space.<//Text>

<text>Solid spot. Sixteen (16) stations spread around, only 4 taken when I arrived around 1pm on a Sunday.

Got near 120kW. There's a 76 station right next to it for convenience store / bathroom needs.< /text>< Pics>

Free electricity but I tend to spend $$ on clothing at the outlet stores while charging up.  I guess coming back from the gas station with a new outfit is better than coming back with a full tank of gas.

Lately I've been going down the street to Splendid Feet for a 30 minute foot massage while charging, costs less than shopping and feels better too!</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Been stopping here since it first opened and it keeps on expanding, thankfully. I think there are 15 or so charging stations now. We plug in and walk to In and Out, get some refreshments, use the facilities, and in 30 mins or so we are back in our car, on our way to Tejon Ranch or San Mateo. If it is evening, we cross the street and walk north to the Chinese restaurant with the excellent Peking duck.</review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Pics>

<text>Is good taste of meat the tortilla is a good size the only thing I don't understand why the tacos don't coming with the normal condiments like onion,cilantro and more. Is a good tacos another thing is why like customers we have to pay the fee for use card for me is like we paying the fee the bank charge the business to used the system. I think this happened is California.</text>< pics>

<Review>Customer service - 5/5
Food - 5/5

We had the steak picado burrito and it was packed with flavor. Not to spicy but had a little bit of heat.

My wife got 3 carnitas tacos and 1 shrimp taco and the were some good size tacos with 2 tortillas each.

This is a family owned business and is on point.

The only thing I didn't like was the red salsa. It wasn't hot enough and didn't have enough flavor.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c328545eec139f:0x80b16cb551f55824< /Gmap_id>< Date>

<text>We were gonna go to El Torito but it was over a hour wait so we opted for Tacos Omanas and glad we did!  The Grandpas Asada and Chile Verde recipes are delicious!!!  What it lacks in ambience makes up for in the food!</text>< Pictures>

Very disappointed. I ordered a carne asada burrito with everything on it and what I got was a bean burrito with sprinkles of onion and carne asada bits. At least the beans and tortilla was good. Couldn’t even taste the carne asada.</Review>

First visit, will have to come back at least 2 more times. Overall score 4.4, but due to unusual circumstance deserved 5 stars.
Let me explain, Covina has some real gems when it comes to Mexican food, and this unassuming shop is one. It is hidden, good luck seeing it from the street. Parking isn't good, COVID tent doesn't help, will be better when restrictions end. (County CDC guidelines are posted very visibly, excellent job there).  It is not an easy location to get to heading north or west. No bathrooms that I saw. Parking, counter, seating are all accessible.
As for the food, outstanding. Do not take a date here as your first stop, when the date is nearly over and you're both hungry cause it went really well and you didn't eat anything cause you were too nervous, then come here for food, trust me your date will love it. If the date didn't go well, drop them off and come here by yourself, at least you will get some good food at a good price. Staff are phenomenal, beyond helpful, if the food wasn't great would still come back at least one more time. Food was prepared quickly and exceeded my expectations. The breakfast burrito was good, as were the asada and carnitas tacos. Breakfast burrito uses fries which are fine, but combo that with the fries for asada fries, you will have something amazing. Tried the chile verde too, was very good, could have used a slightly stronger kick with the chile, but just add some green sauce. The tacos were a little oily, but not in a bad way, breakfast burrito was not oily at all. Beans were good. Will return for a Chile Verde, Colorado, and a Steak Picado burrito in the future. Also need to try the rice. Looking forward to next visit. Highly recommend obviously.< /Review>

< review>
I was introduced to omanas a few years ago and fell in love instantly. The Asada street tacos are amazing,  not the typical street taco tho. Theres no onion/cilantro. They used to drown in sauce.  But its skimpy now.    But since the s. El monte location closed, the recipe for the red chili sauce isn't quite the same. Even when they cooked in the  truck parked in the parking lot, it was on point.  Didn't look appealing, but it was always well worth it! The loavatipn across the street from the high school is good, but I prefer the w. Covina spot now.< /review>

Great place for something like TJ tacos.  I say something like because they have their own flare and robust flavor.  Great price nice staff.  They are also quick.  This location is definitely worth your time.< /Review>

This isn't your ordinary street taco place, they have their own personal yummy recipe. The steak tacos (carne asada) are dipped in their secret recipe red sauce. As for me and my family, we really enjoy the food here. As I mentioned before, it is a little bit different than the usual taco place. If you like to try new foods and your not a finicky eater, I believe you'll enjoy it here!< /Text>

Nope 🤮🤢🙅🏻‍♀️ don’t waste your money. My husband and I are foodies and this place has been by far the worst place we have ever eaten. We failed ourselves tonight although this spot has a 4.2 stars how I don’t know but nope it don’t deserve one star 👎🏼</Text>

Had asudden craving for a taco after leaving the nearby Bank of America. Google maps brought me to the end of a strip mall around the corner and introduced me to this fabulous little taco joint. I had two shrimp tacos which were to die for! Will be coming back to sample other items in their menu!< /text>

My girlfriend and I wanted Tacos and this was the closest place to us at the time. Well the tacos were okay but it’s not regular street tacos they dip all their meat in a sauce which we didn’t like.< /Review>

The Original! This place seems to keep the original recipe of Omanas, same great taste. I think it is better then the El Monte location now. I've been coming to this spot when I crave Omanas.< /review>

<Text>Really really disappointed. The food here is really good. However I bought a gift certificate and when I came to use it I was told they had a new register and couldn't accept it. When I asked with him he said, besides only a manager can give a discount on the register. We were regular customers before. Will never return.< /Text>< Rating>

There is a severe language barrier with the employees. My food often comes out made in the wrong way because they just don't understand English very well. The food is delicious and they're very nice people. But I just think it's very important that someone's working the counter that can communicate with everyone. And what I mean by that is being able to speak very good English and also very good Spanish. Because this is a Mexican restaurant. But all in all the food is good very good<//review>

had some amazing tacos today from this place that I found by myself.   These tacos are delicious carne asada tacos in red salsa and  Carnitas in green salsa the tortillas taste like they are hand made. Left me wanting more.

They also make a kick butt burrito Chicharrones con Chile verde  I randomly found them online and I was calling them personally to find out how they prepare Their pork rinds in Chile This is a very tasty burrito if it's done correctly And when I called I spoke to a lady named Debbie our conversation went on she convinced me and it's family recipe and I came through that night to purchase my burrito of  Chicharrón con chile  All I can say that it tastes like a little piece of heaven to me my mother used to make   This for us. She is no longer with us but it almost felt like he send me to the right place so thank you Debbie I was very satisfied I was happy I called back  To try other things in your menu and I met your son Michael over the phone he was a delight like you were even though you don't know me you made me feel welcomed and I wanted to say thank you I think I found my new Mexican place who knew you were around the corner I've been living in the city for 20 years and I just not discover you're amazing authentic Mexican food A your father should be very proud of you to keeping his legacy. God-bless thank you again.< /Text>

Their Soft Carnitas Tacos are To Die For. Best Soft Carnitas Tacos I've Ever Tasted. And the Green Salsa that comes inside the tacos is the Best Green Salsa I've Ever Tasted. These tacos are so so so good, that I'm going to go get some right now. And the people that work there so nice. It's a little far away from me but it's worth the trip.< /Review>

Horrible Customer Service! If I could leave zero stars I would. The staff here is rude, especially when you tell them they didn’t do your order correctly. It is obvious they are unhappy with their job. The second reason is this place is dirty. If you want a good taco place I suggest you take a drive down to El Sauz in Glendale, California. The people there great you with a smile and will not mess up your order.< /Text>

Poor service, cashier has a bit of a snotty attitude. They charge extra for sour cream. I asked for my salsa on the side but they didn't bother to give me any. So I had to go back and ask for it, even after paying them for sour cream. Shrimp tacos were good. Chicked tacos were nothing special. No reason to go back.</review>

My mother really likes this place she has bought food from them many time we are regular customers I would say and they always mess up on the order like I’m sure my mom will still do business here but this place lost my business I’m tired of them not following directions they don’t even give you the right kind of receipt they should give you the break down bit just the amount $ they charged you but I think this is a horrible place thank you for reading my reviews<//review>

I loved tacos omañas for years but they are so stingy with their lime or lemons whatever you wanna call it. You ask them for some and they give you a half piece cut up into 4 tiny pieces... you Ask for more because obviously my order is for more than one person and they always tell me they’re gonna see if they have more... it’s ridiculous.. you own a damn successful restaurant to be so stingy omañas...!!! Idk if that’s the boss or the workers there ... so my suggestion ... bring your own limes to this restaurant LOL<//review>

Ordered two carne asada burritos.
But In reality, they were bean burritos with a little carne asada and red sauce added. I saw tacos others had ordered and they were small  with double thick tortillas
Attendant was brash.
My credit card didn't read the first time.
He commented, there's no money on your card.
Seemed Hurried, cold, poor people skills.</Text>

The bean and cheese burrito i ordered was pretty plain but the salsa verde i got with it was very good. My amiga had some Adobada Tacos and told me they were excellent. The young latina that took my order was very nice, and kidded around with us and she was pretty as well....<//Text>

<text>I asked for a burrito with sour cream and quack and they forgot yo put it in. But the lady was so friendly and nice and even offered us a side of rice for free while waiting for our order since my 2year old was a little fussy. The food came with this chips, salsa, and beans plate and ir was AMAZING!!! i will be coming back for sure!!! Mistakes happen, ill just be sure to check my food next time. But seriously try this place out! Great food and amazing prices!!!!!!!< /text>< Pics>

This place is literally a hole in the wall, if it hadn't been for the GPS I would have never known it existed. Went at night and it's next to a laundromat but the sign light was turned off however there were people in there. Had the Asada tacos and sopes and a bean and cheese burrito. Size was decent taste was pretty good< /text>

<Text>Decent food, decent price, but around here, where good Mexican food is abundant, decent isn't good enough. VERY RUDE!! VERY SLOW!!
To summarize, if you want decent, slow, rude-mex that's impossible to get in and out of(parking). Tacos Omanis is your spot.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

A couple people strongly recommended this place. The food was okay, but it didn't meet expectations. Personal preference perhaps, but the beans seemed kind of soupy to be in a burrito. Also, the carne asada was all piled at one end. Kinda makes for a bad burrito.< /review>

These are some awesome tacos! I tried the carnitas, asada and fish tacos. All excellent.

Be careful when taking to go, it gets packed real messy.

They also take cards!< /text>

The California burrito was not your traditional California. It was mainly beans, and the fries and meat were almost non existent. I suggest they  ditch the beans or just remove The California burrito off their menu.</text>

<review>Service was bad, the cashier was rude. Also IMH opinion the food here is not as good as the El Monte location. The only benefit is that there is indoor seating at this location and it doesn't smell. Even so I would rather go to the El Monte location.<//review>< pics>

Ordered a  chile relleno the first time and it was disgusting.  It was a more like an omellete and didn't taste the chile, it was some other vegetable.  Went there a second time and ordered a shrimp burrito. It was also nasty .It had 3 large shrimp and  a bunch of sour cream, beans and lettuce.  Won't go there again and I don't recommend it.<//Review>

If you show up and order be prepared to wait.  I wish this place didn't suck so much now i literally live 6 houses down the St from then and they were OK in the beginning nothing special but not this horrible.

I could feel the oil in my mouth and the taste of the meat was disgusting. My husband ate part of my tacos and couldn't sleep all night, he was vomiting and had heart burn. This was the first time I visited the place and for sure the last one.</text>< pics>

The only problem there was that you had to sit outside and no ATM
Now in Covina...Whoo Hoo  there is an ATM and very nice insdie seating (small but still comfortable
I would rate it ***** FIVE STARS.....<//Text>< Pics>

Today was not as pleasant as other days. A while back they would give you chips with beans and salsa, it wasn't a large portion but one big enough to take the craving for free. If you ate there, now there's a small fee. Not confortable refills were free, I was afraid to ask.</review>
