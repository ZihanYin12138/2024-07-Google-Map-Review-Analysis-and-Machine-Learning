For the months she has been filling in I have observed and seen more great  qualities and leadership than we had with our previous manager. She acts immediately and follows through with situations that need immediate attention.   She listens and with discussion comes to an amiable solution to problems.  She is an excellent manager with great  leadership guidance for all employees.</review>< gmap_id>

<review>I must say that I am enjoying having clear definitive goals with plenty of open communication having supervisor Chip being a leader. A testament to Chip's leadership is his clear concise communication. This  along with full management having my back when the going gets tough.<//review>< userid>

I have to say the security staff is always present and highly visible. Easy to find when you need them. They are knowledgable about their responsibilities.They are walking the halls and talking to people. Very friendly.  They go out of their way to be helpful to visitors too. Not like some places I have worked where the staff hide in offices and look at computers. You never see them and can't find them when they are needed.</Review>

I would like to commend the security officer working on the 16th around 140pm when I arrived for my son whom was coming in by ambulance.  As I awaited to get back to my son this lady comes in and starts yelling at me for not having a mask on.I was completely distrot as this lady becomes confrontational with me. The security officer without hesitation steps between us to disfuse her aggressively attacking me, advising the lady to step out side. If it wasn't for him I would've completely lost control of myself with her. The guy did a good job. You have a good guard at Inland and I appreciate that.. I also appreciate the kindness of the nurses and the Security Manager whom with full empathy  contacted me and wanted to assure I was ok and if there was anything she could do to better my experience while at the hospital.  I felt security and hospital staff were genuine and actually cared.< /text>

We have opened an internal investigation on the officer in question and will review the surveillance footage in detail to determine the appropriate corrective actions for those involved. We were shocked and sorry to hear about your negative experience and welcome you to have a phone call directly with our executive team to discuss any further concerns about your visit while in the ER.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback and are hopeful for the opportunity to discuss further on a phone call. We have met with the dedicated Security Supervisor for this specific site and will continue our investigation process through out this week. Please let us know if there is a number we can connect with you directly at and a time of your convenience.\n\nMPS Management'}<//resp>

<text>MPS SECURITY has been a HORRIFIC experience for me!  They are bullies to an elderly, refuse to help, are incompetent, and think they are God!
John, handed me a complaint form, then, immediately grabbed it from my hand when I stated:
“I don’t want you handing my complaint to the right source, I don’t trust you!  I will personally mail it, what’s the address?”

He became enraged when I told him I would find another form online!  He continued trouble harassment throughout our 7 hour stay in ER!  A K-9was present as well as 3 other Security Guards!

MPS SECURITY needs serious investigation, specially when they are suppose to provide service to the public!

My experience at Inland Medical Center in Wildomar, CA, was a total NIGHTMARE!  I thought I could trust MPS SECURITY for help, how wrong I was!  John is about 6’ 3” tall about 345# who loves to intimidate a 4’ 10” tall, 109# Senior Citizen female!< /text>< Time>

This company is a joke, spoke my mind once about the pay and was told by co workers that my supervisor was actively trying to replace me. I did my job and did nothing wrong, the specific supervisor I'm referring to is a joke and completely unprofessional.< /review>

<Text>hey guys i just broke in here through the hole in the fence and it seems like a lovely establishment. honestly i could be more happy with the service because nobody called the cops on me. overall the whole place has quite a nice atmosphere and vibe to it. it seems like the kind of place that just keeps on going because it always has. no matter if there are turkeys on the free. or people breaking in through small holes in the fence. the birds are chirping, the golfers are golfing and everyone is happy. i now feel bad that i broke in here. everything is so nice.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80857d92d3808d29:0x1a4e591d9171fbdd< /Gmap_id></record>

Absolutely, da bomb. Me and my homies always hang at "the club". Lunch looking out over the greens, chatting with Jeeves about silver polish, knocking back a 40 on the 19th hole, what's not to like?</Text>

the dress code is pretty lame, nothing like a bunch of white people telling you how to dress, since when did we becoming such a communist country? the bathrooms aren't what i was expecting, only one works and the other one i tried to use wouldn't go down and i just had to leave my mess floating around like a lost puppy in the middle of winter, i did enjoy the peanuts scattered all around the floor, it was practically a minefield in there. it was very unpleasant seeing lots of white streaks on the counter tops that i believe was cocaine. things only got worse when i got out of the bathroom, immediately a old woman told me to go "fetch" her another mimosa, does everyone there just assume every latino there is a worker? overall i did enjoy my time there, lovely atmosphere,food was fantastic, the people on the golf course where a bit mean though, other than that i would give this a 7 out of 10. i do recommend!< /review>

Nice course redesigned by Alister McKenzie true quick greens and unique bunkering, along with a couple of fairways that crisscross. You are required to get a caddy.< /Text>

Attended a wedding over the weekend hosted by one of the club's members

Not to be confused with the Claremont Resort, the golf club is an older establishment with Tudor styled buildings and a beautiful golf course as its back drop

The bar service was excellent under the circumstances of a very warm day for even Oakland standards

Food service for the reception was excellent as well as the salmon and filet mignon were cooked perfectly

A very lovely venue, it is a private members only club< /text>

I picked one out,no embroidery nothing fancy just a nice clean new coat. I paid almost double the amount of what the coat was worth for next day air shipping. I call to check the status of my order because I wanted to make sure it was on it's way. I was then told that processing takes 3 to 4 days before delivery. Call me crazy but Next day shipping means that I should have the product in my hand by at least the end of the next day. At no point did I see anything on the website or while I was checking out that this was the process. I am an experienced chef and have bought literally hundreds of chef coats from different companies, this is absolutely the last time I will EVER purchase ANYTHING from this brand.</review></record>

<Review>I have used Chef Works many many times.  I would say the drop the ball on this one.  The embroidery was a heck job ! Instead of just replacing what was order they wanted me to return my order and wait for a refund.  More waiting!!!  Customer Service does not exists here.  A simple correction is all we ask for.<//Review>< user_id>

The company has major issues with communication within the company, as well as with business customers placing custom orders. It began with the lack of communication from a sales employee who would return emails, never. Resulting in me having to send multiple emails to get a response. Then being informed that the sales person is now no longer with the company and being referred to a sales manager, Amy. Here I ordered three different pant samples and paid for them. During the order I gave her an updated delivery address. I received an email order confirmation a few days later with the incorrect address. I contacted them immediately. I heard back a few days later from Amy and she asked me if I could go to the incorrect address to retrieve the items or pay again to have the items shipped to the correct address given. I also ordered embroidered chef coats and polos. Before placing this order I requested a mock-up of the polos, which I received. The mock-up was finalized and when I received the polos our company logo was incorrect. I contacted the company immediately. I was told by Amy that I could keep the polos at 35% off (which made zero sense with the company logo being incorrect), deal with the hassle of shipping the box back to the company or pay again to have the polos corrected. Huh!? I've already paid. I spoke with another sales person, Stacy I believe and informed her that the new polos couldn't be sent right away as I will be out of town and won't be able to retrieve it. She informed me that she would make a note on the account to not ship right away. Well, the polos are being shipped right away and no one is going to be there to retrieve them. Overall, this entire experience has been a disaster and beyond frustrating.< /Text>

Other than that not very impressive. Our apartment was less than acceptable when we moved in. A window was broken, the shelves in both closets were broken, The blinds and screen door were broken/and or missing, there was a leak in the shower and the AC didn’t work at all in our bedroom so some of the summer nights were rough. They did fix a few thing quickly after we asked them to, which I appreciate, but the window was never fixed and we were told it was taking long to be delivered because of COVID even though we told them about it right away after doing the walkthrough in the middle of February. they told us the AC is just built that way. For $1521/month for a one bedroom, It wasn’t great but again the location was. Also, don’t plan on getting much if any of your deposit back. We are very clean people, took care of the place very well and we had the apartment professionally cleaned and carpet professionally cleaned as recommended by them and only got $33 of our $400 deposit back. They charged us for having it cleaned AGAIN (I’m not sure what their cleaner could have even had to clean) and charged us for paint. I’m not sure why because the paint was perfect. The apartment was spotless and we gave it back to them much much better than we received it from them when we moved in. I know it’s hard to find places to live that are affordable right now but do your research.<//review><UserId.>117114643352248829862< /UserId.><rating>2<//rating><Name>Angie Perez<//Name></record></dataset><record>

ugh 2020 for all of us here at Vineyard Valley View. Many of us missed the gym workouts and summer and winter get togethers with our neighbors. However, I was thankful to have at least had access to the swimming pool through the summer. The management and maintenance staff are all very responsive and professional!< /text>

<review>I have been here for 9 years. Overall ranking is a B. Good, professional staff, always willing to negotiate a good lease with current residents. Before the pandemic, always good with free coffee and, twice a year, parties for everyone.

There are problems with management enforcing their own rules. Their response to speeders is to have you provide the license numbers of the speeding cars. I would be writing down license plate numbers all day long. Too late to stop the person that took out a staircase, next to a curve in the road. Solution: speed bumps.

The latest problem is excessive (and illegal) dumping. I provide license numbers when I see illegal dumping. Sunday night is a popular night for that, so it seems. Management needs to put signs warning of fines, etc., at the entrance to the complex. It would help to remind tenants that it’s NOT ok to allow family and friends, that don’t reside here, to use the garbage bins. It would help to send emails to remind residents to get stuff into the bin. Old electronics, furniture, and other over-size articles should go to El Dorado Waste site in Placerville. I am not the only one complaining about this. So, myself and a few other residents have taken it upon ourselves to do the work. After 3 weeks, with items not being disposed of (bookcases, chairs, etc.), tenants took it upon themselves to dismantle the items so they could be put in the bins. We have to walk by the trash bin-area, so it helps to keep that clean. Otherwise, you may as well live in a barn.

Again, a pretty good place, but you can save yourself some money by renting elsewhere, with the amenities and problems not being much different.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

At first, I enjoyed living in this complex until my car was backed into one night. I was told that there were no security cameras anywhere in the parking lots or complex. (Even though I've heard from other tenants that there are cameras). Management didn't seem to genuinely care about my issue whatsoever and just said I need to file a police report. After reading other reviews about break-ins, etc. I think it would be important for this apartment complex to install at least one camera per parking lot and near the entrances/exits. It would show they actually are concerned about their tenant's properties. I think it's weird that they can afford to repave the whole complex several times, (which doesn't even need it) but can't install some security cameras. 🤔< /Text>

<Text>Update:
Management followed up with me and were able to resolve a potential issue of vendors charging unwarranted fees, they were able to reduce my fees and return a portion of my deposit. Overall my time here was quiet and peaceful. The pool has a lot of kids but is expected with the great schools in EDH there are a lot of families here. Always felt very safe as well.

I kept my place immaculate, overlooked many things that were unacceptable when moving in, didn't leave an ounce of trash or anything behind when I moved out, and moved out 2 weeks early.. I lived in these apartments for 8 months, and they charged me 800 dollars in fees when I moved out, keeping my entire deposit and actually billing me for the remainder. They charged over 230 dollars for a carpet cleaning, 235 dollars for paint, and much more. I vacuumed
the place 3 days a week, and have pictures of how poor the paint was BEFORE I moved in, and they still charged me 235 dollars for paint. Absolutely ridiculous. Would not recommend anyone living here. When I moved in the water pressure was a trickle, and without telling me all maintenance did was turn up my hot water as much as possible resulting in a burn to my hands, and scalding hot water I could barely turn half way up, and still had terrible water pressure. My appliances were terribly old, and they were extremely careless with the trim, they actually placed trim over top of the washing machine so it wouldn't even open when I first moved in.< /Text>< Pics>

I love Farrah. The facility is nice. The missing star is just because I wish the pool was cleaned more but it is understandable because it’s so lovely and the hotter weather more people use it.< /Text>

Vineyards at Valley View is clean and the amenities are great! The staff in the leasing office are very friendly, professional, courteous and very welcoming.  I enjoy living here. The overall atmosphere and vibe here is great. its quiet and for the most part neighbors are nice too , which is a plus. I haven't had any problems. I would recommend this place to anyone. The views in the morning are scenic and the sunset is vibrant.<//review>

Vineyards is ok. Pet friendly, garages and nice people. However there have been continuous car break-ins and it's not clear what management is doing to help tenants? There were over 12 last night. Some cars with 2 windows broken out. And at least 15 in mid December. Glass everywhere. $500 plus per vehicle to just fix the windows. It appears that thieves use Vineyards as a shopping mall - arrive at night, shine the lights in each car and if they see anything - break the window and ransack the car. They hit many cars so they take their time alarms or no. There are only 3 entrances - it would be easy and inexpensive to at least put a camera at each entrance - to see who comes and goes between 8pm and 5am. Why not? Instead we get a form letter telling us to call the sheriff's office. They just take a report. So it's ok here but park your car in a garage.</Text>

<review>We've been here almost a year and absolutely love living in this community. The views are spectacular, the neighbors are di friendly and the staff are awesome. The functions they put on as well as activities in town are always great and it so nice to know, when you move somewhere that's not familiar, what's happening around you. It's family friendly but the units are set up in a way that you barely hear any noise from children playing. A lot of that has to do with thr quality of the buildings themselves. Affordable luxury, that's what a few of our friends and family have said when they come visit the first time. I would give 5 five star rating except we lack the source to recycle within the complex. No bins in the garbage area for recycling feels wasteful to us. The other issue is about the garbage area's in general. We have plenty of room since both bins are for garbage, but each week the are garbage bags just left on the ground. Even if the bins are no where close to full. And when garbage gets spilled, many times it is just left for someone else to clean up. I truly believe that if those issues were taken care of that Vineyards at Valley View would absolutely be a 5 star property.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I just moved in a few months ago and I love it here.  My building is safe and very quiet. Farah is so very nice and she helped make the move very smooth. This complex is very central to the Town Center and many of the local events. So far I enjoy it here!<//Review>

<text>If i could, i would give this place 0 stars
I want to start out by saying one thing. I never make reviews on businesses. In fact i think its wrong most the time. That being said. Heres my review for the Vineyards at valleyview.

When i originally came in i was greeted by ryan abelia who was genuinely a good guy and you could tell he wanted to get me in an apartment that was right for me. Which is what anyone would expect as a client. From their i had to work with management.

The management is absolutely rude, unprofessional and down right disrespectful. Sonya the property manager was so rude i couldnt even get a word in. When i tried to talk to her she would cut me off and tell me "yeah your probably not quilified" for a 1 bedroom apt. At $1485 even though she had my 1099 and w2 from our business that show i make about 50 thousand a year. Not to metion she tried raising the rent to almost 1600 which she made seem like i couldnt afford. This wouldnt of even been a problem for me if i was treated with respect.

From renting the last 8 years at different places in the area, i have never felt so disrespected. I finally just came in and said i dont want to move here because of management, the way they run things and the way sonya treated me.  I could only imagine how terible spending 13months in that complex with management like that Would be.

I found an apt. A few blocks away with the same price for a 1 bedroom and the staff are professional, nice and got me right in. I highly recommend staying far from this place until they make some real changes in their management practices.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>I have been living here for 3 yrs with my 2 children and as a single mother I couldnt find a safer and more family orientated place anywhere.  The Vineyards team is friendly, understanding and very helpful.  Ofcourse I must mentioned the amazing they put together in September.  Bollywood Nite with excellent food and entertainment was priceless and had a very enjoyable evening with my family.  Looking forward to more events like this : )
At last but not least the location of these apartments is perfect, very close to the town center, just couple of minutes drive to great schools and day cares at the EDH business park.

Drew at the window was nice but drive thru was a 12 minute wait. Order mixed up entirely. No cheese fruit protein box available.  Bacon egg bites were like rubber balls. Never again at noon on Saturdays.< /Text>

Prices are outrageous if you think about it as cost-value function.  I think that's actually what makes it work; sitting in the mall, like the lord of the manor, sipping a drink of unreasonable worth, and watching the wierdos stroll by provides a sense that all is well in the world...

And the coffee is good too.< /Text>< pictures>

It also seems that the depth of knowledge with regard to the drink menu is not as deep as the fully branded stores.

The Guys that work at the store are very polite. But I brought this horrible looking charcoal from there store.That was not usable. I have talked to two different companies that are on the bag The Endpack Packaging Company said they only do the packaging for the charcoal. The guy at Dominguez Distribution Inc said he would contact me and have not.
This is the original post to whoever charcoal this is.
I am very upset with your Five Star Top Quality Charcoal. I was cooking my Pork Ribs and my charcoal started going out and I did not want to drive my car to a store to get more charcoal.So I walked around the corner to Daves Liquor Store at 9313 Vermont blvd and purchased so of your charcoal. Walked back home took my meat off the grill to add the charcoal I just got what fell out the bag was a black log. Something I've never seen in my life. At first I thought that maybe it was just a bad piece of charcoal. But No all them looked like small logs. I put them back in the bag and went to Dave's Liquor store I told him something is wrong with these charcoals. He said thats how they look they are cheap. No $ 4.49 is not cheap that's the price of charcoal at the store. I asked could I change and add more money for the right kind of charcoal. He said he was sorry I couldn't because I opened the bag. So I end up having to put my ribs in the oven for them to finish cooking. What I don't understand is why sell these charcoals knowing they not the right kind of charcoal. Plus you can't see nor. Feel what's in there. A lady in the store said she had purchased them before and was not happy with what was in the bag. I don't know what these odd looking things are mad of but I'm not happy at all. I would like a refund.</Text>

Good deals on beer and liquor.  Somewhat of a circus upon entering the store because of the people hanging outside,  and sometime you'll catch a show waiting to pay . Hey , it's the hood so what do you expect right .</Text>

Very friendly staff. Food was fast. Delicious. We took our food to go and the server went over the order with me thoroughly to make sure it was correct and then went through the bag when the food was ready to make sure we had everything. We'll definitely go back.<//Review>

Inka was recommended by a friend so we came to check it out. Love it and the service was fantastic! Highly recommend the ceviche verde and paella.</review>

Great loved it.
Pretty quick to order.
They start with the drinks and appetizers first. Then once you start munchin they ask you if you're ready to order your entrée.<//Text>

The food portions were great and food was delicious. I was a little disappointed with the "aji de gallina" because it was not as I expected (with a creamy and thick yellow sauce made out of bread and pecans). It was just shredded chicken with some boiled potatoes with some yellow fluid in the bottom. The flavor was good but it did not look at all as the traditional dish.<//Text>

I've liked the few times I've been here immensely. Fantastic food and fantastic service. I rarely see this place slow in the evenings as many people come here for the excellent flavors.</Review>

The meal we had was just okay. It was the service that stunk. The waiter took on 2 larger tables after we sat down and pretty much ignored us the rest of the night. When it came time to pay the check, he notified us that he charged us for someone else’s bill by mistake. The bill was 3 times the amount of our bill. He assured me it was voided and would be back in my account within 24 hours. 2 days later I still haven’t been credited back. When I called to speak to the manager , the same waiter called me back with more excuses for the delay. I repeatedly asked for the name of the manager and he would not give it to me. I will be calling back to speak to the manager or just show up in person.< /Text>

Never had a bad experience here. Good portions of food and good prices :) highly recommended you try this place if in the area... my personal favorite for lunch is the #19. Gyro wrap that comes with a salad that is half a plate worth :)<//review>

<Text>Love this place and the family running it. They have a few places throughout orange country, he sure to check them out. We went during lock down, grabbed our usual plus Sangria to go! You have to have the Lomo Saltido in it's many variations. Add an egg and you won't be disappointed. The staff here are taking extra care to keep you safe. Definitely worth a visit!< /Text>< pics>

There's not a lot of seating but aside from that it's a good place. The green sauce is spicy and I quite like it. The staff is great and the food is good. I wish they had a larger place though because there are a lot of people who want to eat here and not enough seats and tables.<//text>

Fantastic food and wonderful staff.  It's a small place and it gets full around dinner time, but it's worth the wait if there is one.  They do the classics right - Saltados are all excellent.  But I recommend Macho Fish!  10/10 flavor, portion, and presentation</text>

Love coming here! The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Service is usually pretty quick. Everytime we bring friends, they enjoy it as well. It is easy to eat a vegetarian or vegan meal here, which is immensely helpful when trying to find a restaurant that will accommodate multiple dietary needs.<//Text>

Usually this place is pretty good. I got the soup today and it is clearly really old the rice in the soup is so mushy and when I called to talk to someone the lady on the phone was totally not helpful and actually really rude. Never going here again cause of this.< /text>

I go to SoCal every two weeks for work and I go to Inka Mama's at least twice each time.  I never had a bad meal here.  Service is excellent as well.<//review>

Awesome spot. Not especially cheap but prices are fair. :) HOWEVER they only include sodas for the children's dinner, not juice or milk. I wish they would change that!! I don't want to give my toddler soda so I get charged an extra 3 bucks for her tiny apple juice? :(</Text>

Cant go wrong with the savory and delicious food here. I love that they have good vegetarian options. If you like meat, it falls off the bones and is simply amazing! Wait staff is fun and very helpful.< /Text>

Went with a somewhat large group, was my first time there. Food was tasty, and some of it was great. Mixed feelings overall on the variety of dishes shared since we ate "family style". The service was a bit lackluster, which is why I am giving it 3 stars. Forgotten orders, no napkins or silverware provided after asking three times - actually just got up and got our own - when told we would be eating family style, no serving spoons or ladle provided. Staff was kind, but that only goes so far, as talent goes much further. Will go back and hope for a better experience. Hoping they just had an off, or busy, night.<//text>

< Review>
I must admit, I think I'm addicted to this place. Are used to go to their location in San Clemente quite a bit, and was afraid that this one wouldn't be as good when I move to Huntington Beach. But, I drive over here about once a week to eat or to get food to go. I absolutely love their food, and the service is great as well. I love the atmosphere here too, I feel so relaxing and inviting. I've taken my sisters to eat here, as well as friends. I love the muscles appetizer.<//Review>

Never heard of Peruvian food before but wow! was this good! Fried rice was very good. My wife had SALTADO VAINITAS DE POLLO (veggies and chicken) that tasted amazing. Their soups come large enough to feed an army. Will definitely go back.<//Text>

I wouldn't say I'm an expert in Peruvian food. And I may be biased since this is one of the first Peruvian restaurants I've been to. But the food was outstanding. I loved the bread with the green sauce.< /review>

<text>I have to say I'm a fan. I've been to the Inka Mamas in foothill ranch and aliso Viejo. Peruvian style food- the flavors are delicious. I like to get this garlic shrimp dish it's simple but delicious! We've also tried their beef and chicken dishes which have always been flavorful and perfect portions. They have great waitstaff.  Always available without pestering.</text>< pics>

<Text>This has been my favorite Peruvian restaurant for many years. Unfortunately the last couple times I've been there and ordered the lomo saltado  and paid for the upgrade on the meat I got meat that was tough and the last time it was uneatable and difficult to even cut. Was told the kitchen said it wasn't tough for them  rather than be apologetic and offered to do better.</Text>< Time>

What can I say, if you are craving something authentic and different go to Inka Mamas.

They use to be down a few doors from their current location but nothing has changed in terms of food or service.

Wonderful authentic Peruvian food, super friendly staff, and reasonable prices.  I have been coming for years and have never been dissatisfied.  The beef lomo soltado is our go to.</text>

<text>Glad this place has craft beer available. Lomo Saltado is pretty standard - wish it was more on the heartier side - kinda plain/dry if u get the normal beef version. Seafood Saltado is better. Green sauce for the bread needs a little ummph.
Hardly ever a wait. Workers are friendly. Parking is abundant.</text>< response>

Great food and atmosphere, close to the movie theaters in Aliso Viejo. We ordered the Combinado de carne, Ajiaco de Pollo and Ajiaco de Pollo. Prepared well. The Ajiaco was a spicy chicken dish but spice level was perfect. We enjoyed our food and will return.< /Text>

<review>Came here by myself.
It was a tad awkward as they have no place to wait to be seated.
The bread they served came with butter of course, and it came with a mysterious green sauce that had a hint of spice and was delicious.
I ordered the bisteck apanado. From ordering to receiving the dish, they clocked in at only 5 min 30seconds, so quite quickly.  5/5 food speed. The cilantro rice they served with it had just the right amount of Cilantro, along with The garlic on the steak dish I had. 4/5.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Gmap_id>

The soup is the best ever. The lomo or the pollo saltado is THE BEST. I usually stick to my favs but anything ordered there is scrumptious. Go and give Peruvian a try, you won't regret it.<//Review><rating>5<//rating>< name>

However they do not give enough of the protein the meat the fish both of our dishes were heavy on the calamari and very light on the fish or shrimp. it's a shame because it's a type of place we would like to return to unfortunately we left unsatisfied.< /Review>< Rating>

Love this place always! I have been to this branch about 4 times and love it. I am always ready to go to this place because even though I am a lacto-vegetarian, I find good vegetarian options here. They have happily served me Estofado recipe modified and replaced meat with vegetables. It tastes delicious. And how can I not mention their bread and aji Verde sauce! Tasty!<//Text>

Best Peruvian food ever. I have gone to all their locations and they are all wonderful. Their food is very consistent and delicious at every location. Each location has a different feel but all the food is so good. The green sauce is to die for. I have had to buy some to take home because i could not get enough of it. Lomo saltado and col saltado are my favorite dishes. There is a coupon on their website for a free appetizer with the purchase of an entree. I don't know how to spell it but it is delicious too. The staff is always very nice and attentive. If I was rich I would go to Inka Mama's every day because I love it so much!</text>

My favorites are Beef Lomo Saltado, Inka Special, Ajaico de Pollo, Combinado de Pollo, Beef Stew, any Tallarin dishes and Cabrito Norteño ( it's like braised lamb), empanadas, and Calamari. The soup here is delicious too. They offer freshly made bread with the green hot sauce made from lettuce and chili. It's too sure for! Their food is mostly stir fried with vegetables, stews, with a side of beans and rice. Service is pretty fast even during rush hour.< /review></record>

Delicious Peruvian food! The Lomo saltado was some of the closest we've had to Peru! The pisco sour wasn't as close to what we had in Peru, but still delicious.</Text>

<text>Good Lomo saltado. No bistec a lo pobre. No pollo a la brasa. So, not very authentic. Very american. The bus boys were nice, waitress wasn’t very helpful. Service was well below average and took much longer than average. Overall, okay.<//text>< Pictures>

Great service, the staff was very friendly and attentive but the food did not go along with the service. Aside of the lomo saltado the other dishes we order lacked the authentic peruvian flavor to the point I wouldn't even consider it peruvian. If you want a good lomo, this place will do the trick but I will not order anything else...</Review>

Thought I'd give it another try. Didn't do it for me. Pricy for the quality. Maybe Peruvian food does not agree with me.</Text>

My husband and I went to the Aliso Viejo Restaurant today in anticipation of some good peruvian food...  I ordered the Lomo Saltado and hubby ordered seafood  Saltado and both dishes were terrible!!   Both were extremely salty.

I paid an extra $3.00 to sub Rib eye in my Lomo Saltado because on my last visit the meat was unchewable..  I asked the waitress to have the cook prepare my RibEye MR and it came out well done.  The seafood in my husbands dish was very dry and like rubber.  I will not go back to this restaurant and do not recommend to anyone.  It is just not consistant.

Sincerely,
Unhappy Customer</text>

Third time at Inka Mama's in the cities of Foothill Ranch, San Clemente, and just recently Aliso Viejo.  All three places were excellent (knowledgable, friendly, and professional staff), the decor/ambiance, and finally THE FOOD.  The prices are well worth it.  I know nothing about Peruvian food except through friends and acquaintances -who tell me that this is the real deal.
This is what I typically order:
Appetitzer
-Ceviche: C'mon... It's Peruvian Food.  I typically judge a Peruvian restaurant by its Ceviche, just as I judge a Thai Food Restaurant by its Pad Thai...  It's a fresh marinated fish in a hot chili-lime juice. There are thinly sliced red onions and chopped cilantro. It comes with 2 slices of potatoes and 1 slice of sweet potato.  It is on the spicy side; which has the tendency to open up the appetite for the main dish.$12.95
-Seafood Paiaya... This is my #1 go to!  It is infused fried seasoned rice mixed in with seafood that was sauteed in garlic: baby squid, mussels, fish, and shrimp.  Be warned: This is not on their "To Go" menus and at the Foothill Ranch and San Clemente restaurants it's not on their in house menus.  It's hidden like "animal style" is to In & Out.  Just ask for it, they'll know.  Paiaya Pronounced "Pie-A-yah". Also if you wanna see what it looks like just Google Image it. $15.95
-Macho Fish... Is Pan fried fish fillet that has chopped shrimp and calamari cooked in a spicy garlic and chili sauce.  It's served with rice and potatoes.  They'll offer a brown rice option for those that want to eat cleaner but in Peru it's traditionally served on white rice. $14.95

There it is. Hope this helps.< /Review>

Menu Items I've tried:
Aliaco de Vegetales
Saltado con Vegetales
Tallarin Saltado con Vegetales
Chaufa de Vegetales

For a real treat try the Maracuya drink.  Super yummy!!</Review><name>Carrie Monroe< /name></record></dataset><record>

Super good price! Kept looking  around but made a great choice and went with the King of Sounds! 🤴. CLEAN  INSTALL.. got a nice set of double amps, JBL 12" 1000 Watts, tint, and a DVD screen... loving it. Great job in all service. King of Sound should be your choice!< /review>

<review>I found King Of Sounds on Google and noted it had very good reviews. So I decided to go there for new speakers for my truck. I was impressed with the owner Raffi and the quality of the installation and the price. I came back a week later and had them install a rear view camera that doubles as a front and rear dash cam. The price was less than half what I was quoted elsewhere. I would definitely recommend them.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I discovered this place by randomly using Google search for tinted window service. Ceramic to be specific. Some have said their windows resulted in bubbles days later. Well NOT ME. The majority of reviews were positive so I moved forward. After installation I was told to wait 3 days before rolling my windows down and that I did.  It's going on 2 weeks now and I have no problems. I think I got a good price for both front and rear passenger windows/$200 (labor included). I plan on going back to upgrade my sound system. KUDOS to King of Sounds!< /text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>DISAPPOINTED!  I knew was over paying but figured just get it done professionally as I have already spent a lot on the stuff needing to be installed and too busy to do myself I went on google and found this place.

Which by reading the reviews and seems to be all based on referrals. So I didn’t shop around and left with them and agreed to the price of $700 for all the installation which didn’t think was much as I’ve gutted the inside removed the seats and done more half of the dynomatt already.  And it was supposed to be done tomorrow night.

Tomorrow night comes and had to leave a family function to find out “it’s a lot of work my friend a lot of work” which I replied if you need it another day just say so. Okay tomorrow afternoon it will be done.

I even ordered food and drinks for the crew which they never gotten. Which DoorDash took a photo of all the food and drink left at their doorstep which audio king says they didn’t order anything and the driver took the food and drinks.

I sent the food to check if they where really working on my car that night to find out no body was even there.

Come to find out on the DVR THEY THEMSELVES INSTALLED THAT IT WAS JUST STARTED ON THE DAY I PICKED IT UP!  And look at the pictures I posted.

Was lied and lied and lied too and over paid to have car damaged wreaking of Body Order and seat soaked with another mans sweat is disgusting honestly haven’t checked out the rest of it what they done cause the car smells that bad.

They were supposed to dynomatt the entire car as you can see they didn’t.  So wheres the rest my sheets ($10.00+ EACH sheet btw) and looks like there was only 10 to 15 used when I dropped off a box of 60.

Plus the ones they did use wasn’t even put on right they just slapped it on and there’s air bubbles all over.

SMH  i should’ve went with my gut and went elsewhere imma stop writing more before it triggers my anger.

So yeah avoid this place. Also they didn’t even work on my car until the 4th day I picked it up again they were only supposed to have it for 1 day. And I know this cause the DVR THEY INSTALLED RECORDED IT.  And more which I don’t speak spanish and couldn’t bare to sit in my car to watch due to the sweat and body order the tech left in there.

FML
BUT
FAK!

Disappointing AF and support local business a deserving worthy one. Not a lying things missing items things weren’t done like discussed SMELLY ONE.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>Got my car tinted not too long ago and honestly I gotta say I love their work! My family has known the owner for couple of years now and when I asked them where I can get my car tinted locally for a reasonable price they sent me to King of Sounds right away.

<Review>Excellent service and workman ship for installing the backup cameras for my car. Attention to details and prompt service make me very happy. This shop is highly recommended for anyone who needs customized audio and video device on the auto.

Honestly the best place i have ever come. I had a speaker problem and the owner helped me out, i got my sub woofer installed and got my windows tinted. Window tint came with a lifetime warranty. My next project will be to install a touch screen and maybe some jbl speakers. Still deciding on the speakers. They got some cool gadgets to like back up cameras etc. The owners really nice. I highly recommend checking this place out.< /Review>

Raffi hooked my Nitro up from installing new headlight housing with top of the line LED's and fog lights to my amps and speakers and woffers at exceptional prices!! Professionally done... Everyone there is super nice and no sales pressure and will answer any questions... they have definitely earned a customer for life!!</text><UserId.>116445271386827515662</UserId.><name>David Lemus< /name>< Gmap_id>

Hands down the best stereo shop in town.. there prices are reasonable and they do really good installations. I brought all 3 of my cars there to get systems put in. Mario, richard are great installers and very patient with any questions that you may have about your install. Rafi is a great guy to work with as well. I'm a customer for life.<//review>

Great and fast service! Went to a different place to upgrade my sound system and I didn’t like it there. Drove by here one day and got a new subwoofer for my car and I love it!

Very nice for someone who don’t know a lot about cars, they took car of me and educated me on what I need to do to get the best sound quality. Thank you guys!<//text>

Very nice people.  Stopped by and found out the antenna base fir my car is incredibly expensive and requires the roof being taken off...so they did a quick glue repair for FREE. I am blown away by this generosity.< /Text>

I've shopped around and King of Sound gave me the best deal on install of 2 sets of speakers and powered sub! Raffi is a very friendly proprietor and fair businessman.   Mario and crew Juan are great!  They are professional and I would highly recommend them, and definitely call on them again for 2nd sub!< /Text>

<review>Outstanding service. I came in this morning for an alarm install. But not only did I buy the alarm, I also added the dashcam with front and rear cameras, and also a bluetooth radio. The service here is amazing. The staff is very friendly and there was zero sales pressure. Funny how that works, how I kept buying more and more when there's no pressure. I digress. The install they did for all the components was totally professional. It looked like a factory install. Highest quality craftsmanship here. The prices are very fair, which explains why I ended up buying more. The owner, Raffy, is a super cool guy. He made sure I was happy with my purchase and was taken care of. I'll be bringing him my other car for a new alarm and dashcam. And I'll be telling all my friends about Raffy. I give King of Sounds the highest recommendation.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c32873669a6559:0x618db7f6f0bceed1<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I came in to find out why the screen went black on my 2013 Camaro. They took it apart to see what the problem was. They spent about a half an hour and it turned out to be a loose wire. Raffi would not let me give him anything for the time. He just asked me to recommend him to my friends. Done! I was blown away what great service!< /Text>

This place is by far the best place you can go to for all your stereo needs. The owner Raffi is very very polite HONEST and will do his best to make sure you leave happy. My experience speaking I bought amps speakers and a box. I am a business owner myself so i look at businesses a little different then most people  do. I look at the sales pitch the answers to my questions. I trying to see if I'm going to hear BUll***T azz lines. Raffi is a good business owner and I left with all confidence in my purchases peace of mind. He was nice enough  to go above and beyond for me adding LOTS OF EXTRAS at no additional cost. I won't say what they were but it was a nice gesture. Thank you Guys for the great service and will work on my other car soon.< /text>

I absolutely love this place! The owner Rafi was very welcoming all around nice guy! customer service is second to none! prices are the best in town. I got my new car stereo installed today and i was very happy. i have been up and down arrow hwy  and azusa ave as well and came across people who were extremely over priced and had bad customer service. i would highly recommed (king of sounds) to anyone!

I took my truck to a different location around here and got screwed. Speakers went out the first week due to bad installation, the technician here knows what he's doing and the owner Raffi made sure the job got done right and even covered my warranty even though I didn't purchase the system here. You earn my loyalty and will definitely bring my 2nd vehicle here for upgrades. I will recommend this shop to my buddies and colleagues. Thank you.<//text>< Pics>

<review>Best place to get your stereo work, subwoofers and even car wraps and l.e.d.s done. Rafi put in my friends subwoofer and amp and wired it all amazingly. Also Mario helped save my subwoofer I accidently blew a coil on. Still bumping the single coil! Thank you guys at King Of Sounds!!!</review>< pics>

< Review>
All I do at this UPS is ship simple boxes, so I go in, confirm the address, pay money, and get out. This is pretty straightforward.

The other reviews are bad probably because the workers there don't have any patience (that's the common pattern I've seen), so if you are thinking of asking the cashier questions or having workers do small favors like taping your box, they won't be friendly to you.<//Review>

He tried to charge me for a shipping bag that I have gotten for free at all other UPS stores. He then proceeded to say that he couldn’t ship my item in that shipping bag. He took my item without packing it in anything and then threw the receipt at me.

He also tried helping three customers at the same time in the small area. He was not practicing social distancing for the customers.

Avoid going here! The store is also a mess and unorganized.<//Text></record>

Old Asian guy who works there has the worst attitude ever. He made up rules so he didn't have to take my package. And ended up taking a smaller one from me. No recipe. To the old guy who works there it's not my fault you're unhappy with yourself there is no need to put that onto other people. UPS do yourselves a favor and fire that guy. He is chasing any business you might get away.<//Review>

< Review>
I stopped by to drop off a couple packages. When i go their, there were two associates i stood there for a couple minutes as i understand sometimes people are busy but they completely ignored me for minutes when i was standing right in front of them and  when i asked for help the older gentleman told me with  attitude they were busy too. I was in utter shock, when he finally came over to help i asked for a receipt he scanned my packages and right in front of me threw each one next to me. Im sorry, but this is beyond bad customer service. If one of those boxes would have hit me i would have called the authorities that is assault . I cant believe this is the service this store provides . The only reason i went there was that my local office was close. Anyways stay away from here UPS you really need to assess your employees work ethics.< /Review>

So I did not know what he want and then the female staff yelling at me "the brightness of your phone! He can't your code!" with chinese. I mean she can say it more politely instead of yelling.

I called to ask the status of my package return since it’s been a couple days now, he says rudely I should just wait. I’ve never had this issue with any UPS store like this. My returns have always been quick with dropping it off at OTHER UPS stores. I asked literally ONLY  2 questions and he hung up on me.

UPDATE: I dropped off my amazon packages at another location, and my return is finished on the same day! I dropped my package off at this location last week, and I still haven’t heard anything about my returned package!</text>

4 Stars because the parking is pretty annoying at times.  Not their fault but its annoying at times when their parking drop off area is being used by other businesses nearby.

I see a lot of people complaining about their attitude and them being cheap with tape and everything.  Please remember that it is your job to have the package ready.  I understand that they could be a little more nice about it but if anything the USPS also charges for tape as well so there is no difference in that.

Attitude, I have not experienced them in a bad mood.  I usually drop off boxes for Amazon a couple times a week.  I just go in say hi and drop off the packages most of the time.

If you are just dropping off to return packages or ship out things that are already pre labeled and ready to be shipped out I would say come here.< /text>

<Review>I was here Monday November 12th at 10:25 in the morning and a customer was being extremely rude to the gentleman running the store I guess he wanted some free boxes or tape or something and the guy running the store said he couldn't just give him free supplies and then the old guy was like I'm 73 I do a lot of business I don't want your attitude and all this stuff, so I just thought I'd leave this review in case there's another really bad review in a few minutes because it's not really fair to the UPS store manager when some customer comes in Acts all angry about something ridiculous. The guys always been super helpful when I go here for stuff so I can't really say why anyone would give him less than 4 or five stars< /Review>< Response>

<Text>Don’t go here!
They even charge $0.75 for 10” duct taping.
I never seen ups store like this!!
Ups should revoke ups store authority/license.
How they are still in business?</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Customer support was really bad because I requested to hold at the the ups location and I went to the store to pick up but said “this is not a warehouse”. This is bad customer service.< /text>

<text>Worst UPS store ever. Staff was EXTREMELY RUDE. No customer service skills at all. The store was very messy and unorganized.

Go to other locations to drop your UPS packages if you are not in a rush.<//text></record>

I would give it a zero star if I could!!! This place has the worst customer service ever! I went in to drop off my return box and I was like Hi how you doing, this lady was like, “I’m not providing you tape.” ....... I mean I did need to tape my box and my label but I said Hi.... what kind of manner is that?  Why are you so mad? If you wanna come to work with this type of attitude you might as well just stay home, don’t be out there ruining other people’s day.</Review>

reported to UPS Adminstration for not providing the new service program that was created couple months ago. Shipped someone else's item with my label and is now their problem.

Came with box and a shipping label already paid for, and they tried to charge me just to tape the box closed! I have never had that happen at any UPS store I've been to. The employee was rude and not understanding.<//review>

<text>DO NOT go here!! The owner Francis is extremely rude. I went here with my two year old daughter and while I was looking for the right envelope I gave my daughter some post it notes that I was going to purchase when suddenly the owner (Francis Whang) comes to us, doesn't say anything and snatches the post it out of my daughter's hands and snatches the envelope out of my hand. People shouldn't snatch things out of anyone's hands especially kids. He could have hurt my daughter because of his stupid rude ways. Again DON'T take your business here. The shipping supplies are overpriced, rude owners run this place and your child could possibly get hurt by Francis. Worst place ever. UPS should shut down people like Francis.< /text><name>Mel Mendez< /name>< userid>

<review>There is a reason this store only score low rating while the one in Baldwin Park get high rating. Poor services. Worst services ever. This store would never answer a single question regarding shipping if you have a pre-printed label. The staff is so rude, I guess because of the franchise store, they never care. I am going to report their service to UPS later. Compare to them, the one in Baldwin Park (next to Walmart) is better than them 10 thousand time.</review>< Pictures>

<review>The woman works there is so rude, her face is like "hey, you owe my 10 thousand dollars".

First time I was there, I was mailing a package, so the shipping and insurance was like 20 something bucks. She printed the label before i paid for it and I remembered that I could get discount as AAA member. So I asked, she said it's only gonna save you a few dollars and apparently she didn't want to redo the work and helped me save that money. So I didn't force her to do that and paid.

Second time. I was dropping off 3 Amazon pre-paid trade-in packages. As always, I asked if I could get a receipt. I did this all the time with every other UPS stores (some of them even offer me one w/I me asking).  The same woman there told me it's going to be 25 cents for each receipt. I asked her is this an UPS store, she said yes. And I asked why other stores didn't charge for the receipt? She pauses for a second or two and answered it is what it is. God, really? So I said don't bother and walked away.

But the way, the store is so dirty, pieces of tapes, papers are all over the floor. The gift card stand looks like it's from the 70s and never been cleaned since then.

I'll not recommend this store to any one, I feel unsafe shipping with them.</review><time>1432080656227</time><Gmap_id>0x80c2c55a0e755cad:0xd2598d9852af359b< /Gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics><Rate>1<//Rate>< resp>

<Review>Horrible Customer Service! Was told by Amazon to bring my return here so they can print and ship my return last week. Went in and I didn't have my QR Code on hand so had to come back but ask for a strip of tape for my package. It's a $2 charge to seal but the shipping is free. OK nevermind, I'll just bring it back. Came back today and I was told by the same UPS store guy Francis and a small lesbian looking girl (with a horrble Cantonese accent that I could barely understand her) that I have to pay $2. I told her Amazon told me it was for free and you just told me the other day its free Francis. Their response was, the shipping is free, the label costs $2 to print! Turns out Amazon provided the wrong label and the entire thing should have been free. A quick call to Amazon in the store would have fixed everything, but they were so concerned about the $2 that they chased me out of their store with no alternative resolution except "Pay us $2 to plint!". Don't bother coming to this one, just look at all the other reviews, it's not just me. I heard a lot of packages gets lost and damaged from this UPS store, they're probably abusing the packages after the customer leaves. Don't waste your time coming to this store, they don't care about you or your package.<//Review>< user>

really??? I have to pay 25 cents to get a receipt for a package I drop off? If UPS f**k up on the package, how do I prove that I shipped it? Is it only this location or all UPS stores charge their customers for a drop off receipt?< /Review>

The hours posted outside says they open at 9:30- It is now 9:58. The person who finally showed up actually seemed bothered that people were there waiting. Her attitude was not necessary, especially after she was late.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Very poor service attitude. Since you have chosen this job, you must be worthy of the salary. It's your duty to serve customers with sincerity, and people at this age don't understand this truth.

极差的服务态度。既然你选择了这个工作就要对得起这份工资。拿出诚意服务顾客是你的本份，年纪这么大的人怎么这个道理都不懂。<//text>

It's VERY friendly...the bartenders are very accommodating. There are fun games like shuffle board  and keno as well as pool. The establishment itself is very old. It's a nice place to unwind and watch sports t.v.<//Text>

Locals Bar, a throw back to a different time. The owner can be a bit rough and not especially a great place for the tourist but if you like a classic bar with Juke Box, Shuffle Board, Pool Table and, of course, the big fireplace, then the Fireside may be just right for you.< /Review>

<Review>Service was great. Very safe handling of the food as you pick your ingredients. Portions were very large. We were concerned it would not be the same since we don't get to build our own dish. They did a great job and make the plates exactly how we wanted them. Happy to see this place still doing well and will be back.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Grab a bowl fill it up as much as possible then head to the counter where they cook it up. $13 will get you a great dinner. Plus that have thee best brewed topical passion ice tea! Also at the table they will bring you yummy  Sesame seed flatbread . Yum. It’s a hit with the whole family.<//text>

<Review>Unbeatable. 5🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Been dining at Mongorian Grill across 20 years. Alton has served as long as I can remember. His waiting attention and service is on point with or surpasses most all high end dining and easily beats any chain restaurant. Love Alton!  As far as the food. It’s dank. They encourage huge bowl crafting. They’ve removed some food items that have proved themselves to be superior at extending the bowls - like snow peas. Grill is happily scraped when asked so no need to feel like you’re a picky customers. Meats are solid and trimmed well. Veggies are crisp. Sauces tasty.  Noodles are extra noodley (whatever that means). As a youngster this use to be our post workout joint.  It’s tasty Mongorian.<//Review></record>

This place is great and I've been going here for about a year.  Consistently good food you choose yourself. It's easy and fun to select your meats and vegetables, sauces, and then watch as it's cooked right in front of you.

Very reasonably priced with a casual atmosphere.  The wait staff is friendly and efficient.  Parking isn't bad but as this place shares a lot with Souplantation, it can get full.  I strongly recommend visiting for excellent Mongolian grill.< /text>

Good bang for your buck. You can get a lot of food for cheap. Staff hustles their butts off. Food has flavor, does need more salt.< /review>

< Review>
Delicious fresh veggies stir fried.  The server was awesome even though we came in 10 till close we were still made to feel welcome.  And it's cool because we got to put fresh uncooked meats, fish and fresh veggies into a bowl as tall as we could fit, along with a small bowl of personally selected sauces which included ginger sauce, bbq oil, garlic sauce etc. .  And then took to a cook who joyfully threw our food selection onto a gigantic flat skillet.  Really fun to watch!  And so so good with rice and a seseme bread.  Hopefully we go back soon.< /Review>

<text>A staple work lunch location at this 'build your own and have it cooked in front of you' place. It can be very entertaining to watch people as they attempt to fill their bowl with as much meat, veggies, and noodles as possible prior to cooking😁 I'm personally a huge fan of their sesame bread!</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_avPeSAC2pLuXbaf1j3sP8YHwDcChzkbKWF8y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

Just had an AMAZING picnic dinner thanks to Stir Fresh Mongolian Grill! They have an AWESOME outdoor set up that made this COVID 19 Nervous Mama SO comfortable! The friendly staff helped me build my bowl while I looked on behind a screen much like they do at Subway. The portions were MASSIVE and I walked away a very happy (and full) customer! I will also add that we drove from Temecula just to come to this awesome establishment to get some proper Mongolian. Please COME SUPPORT this business before we lose it! ❤< /review>

You build your own bowl using the ingredients laid out salad bar-style and take it to the grill to be cooked in front of you. If you're concerned about spices from the person in front of you, you can always ask them to clean it before cooking yours. Just be aware they'll still be cooking 2-3 others at the same time. They clean the grill often and keep it super hot so there isn't a problem with bacteria or anything like that. Honestly, I think my bowl tastes a little better when the grill isn't freshly cleaned. Your meal comes with rice and sesame bread, and you can add on soup or other appetizers. But honestly, you won't need it. One bowl is more than enough for me, so I only recommend getting the all-you-can-eat if you want to make multiple small bowls with different flavors.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

You pick out all your own meats and fresh veggies and concoct your own stir-fry sauce from the many sauce ingredients they have available. They supply several recipes you can follow if you want to.

The food is good. The service is not that good. The main for 3 star is that the food is little over priced.</Review>

We are sorry that you feel that our prices are too high,  what other mongolian grills have you compared to us when it comes to pricing?

In this price we offer 5 meat options, two seafood, noodles, and many vegetarian offerings.  Meals also include rice and sesame biscuits.

<Text>Dirty place; from the counters, serving bar, used/handled  tongs inside food trays, restroom, alarmingly dirty ceiling and vents.

The service was nice and polite, but when I asked for coffee I was told there wasn't any made...(would've be nicer if they could make a fresh pot)

Not a true vegetarian meal, because they cook on the same grill the cook meats and tofu

Please clear up the restaurant for sanitary and health sakes.
Thanks
I hope things are better.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>
{'time': 1579650951145, 'text': 'Sorry you had a bad experience.  When did this happen?  Calling us personally usually can clear up any problems you had and hopefully a resolution can be made.  Usually on a busy shift, tongs do get put in wrong containers by guests.  We have a dedicated buffet attendant that refills and cleans the buffet.  Sometimes that person can get overwhelmed by the volume of guests.  As far as coffee, me may take that item off the menu as it is rarely ordered.  We do however offer both green and herbal teas for hot beverages.  Stir Fresh in fact can be a true vegetarian meal.  There is a sign at the start of the buffet which states in plain language that any bowl can be cooked in a wok in the back kitchen separately for guests who choose to eat vegetarian or have food allergies.  As for the ceiling and restroom, thank you for your input and we will make changes to address that problem.  Again, you are welcome to give us a call and we can discuss your visit and hopefully make it right with you.  Thank you.'}</Resp>

Consistently the best Mongolian style restaurant I've found anywhere in the country.

Single serving or all you can eat.  Frozen sliced meats and lots of fresh vegetables.  I find single serving more than adequate.  Noodles can be added to your bowl.  White rice and sesame toast served at the table.  Flavors come from sauces both premixed & make your own.  Key is to use 10+ scoops of liquid, 2 of which should be oil.  ( Oil keeps for from sticking to the grill, liquid hello steam the vegetables.).

Very tasty with lots of opportunities to experiment with flavors & very filling.<//review>

Not a fan of budgets, especially during cold season but they do a fine job of keeping it stocked, organized and neat.  Not a ton of variety when it comes to flavors and the dragon's sauce wasn't even hot.  I find most taste the same.  Concept is great but never leave feeling satisfied.  $50 for lunch for 2 adults, 2 kids (all you can eat).  A step up from panda express in that you can choose your veggies, add noodles etc but loses a star for being underwhelming in flavor.</Review>

Good Mongolian grill, do it yourself meals. Create it as you like it, season to  your taste or follow the spice recipe chart. They have a menu to order from and have a kids menu. They give you a small bowl of rice and basket of flat sesame bread. Good prices for the amount you get. It is all you can eat but I never going for seconds as the portions you can get into the bowl are filling. There is definitely a system to getting the best ratio of meat and veggies in a bowl. Good service, they are quick about getting you your drinks and appetizers. They can get pretty busy, sometimes waiting as much as 15 minutes to be seated. Rare occasions you could wait 30 minutes, again rarely.< /Text>

<text>Delicious food. I like that I can pick everything myself. Only 4 stars because I feel it's a little over priced. I wish there was a 2 bowl option rather 1 or unlimited. Service was great chefs very kind and quick.< /text>< Time>

I like this place a lot and have been here dozens of times over the years. Unfortunately I live far away and would come more frequently if I could.
I HIGHLY DOUBT THE TRUTH in those who give this fine place a one to two star rating. Sounds dubious to me. they cook the food right in front of you on very large hot surfaces. Check it out, you won't be dissatisfied.  And a fair price for the food.</Text><UserId.>118055638132495177964< /UserId.>< Date>

<Review>Fun getting to choose your items for them to Stir Fry.  I like experimenting with the different sauces they have.  Watch out for people ahead of you that load up on their spicy dragon oil sauce.  Some of the residuals could end up making yours or your kids dishes too spicy.  The nice cooks will clean the grill at your request.  Kids also like putting a tip in the mail and hitting the gong.  Can get crowded at peak times.</Review>< pictures>

<time>1569639199278</time><Rating>5</Rating><text>Amazing food! Friendly for vegans, vegetarians, carnivores, keto, paleo, whole foods, any style of eating! You pick from any type of protein (beef, chicken, pork, fish, calamari, tofu) and add as many veggies as you like (too many choices to list!) Then add noodles if you want and then pick from a plethora of custom sauces ranging from mild to extremely spicy and they cook it fresh for you on the grill. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful and even suggested ways to help us save money. Only $2 difference between 1 bowl or all you can eat, but 1 bowl is plenty for most people, even if you are a big eater like me!  They also provide white rice and delicious sesame bread and offer a small selection of beer and wine at a decent price. Definitely recommend!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Always busy. A little pricey. That being said, I LOVE the food. It's fun to make your own meal and it's decent for picky eater because they can make whatever they want, too. Pro tip: if you dont do spicy food, ask the cooks to scrape down the grill. You'll want to tip them for it, but when they scrape the grill, your food will get a lot less spiciness in it.</review>

<text>EXCELLENT CATERING EXPERIENCE!! I had to organize a company lunch for about 200 people, and I thought it'd be difficult to do. But stir fresh showed up with their grills on wheels, and i didn't have to do ANY kind of work.  i've never seen such a smooth event. the line never once got backed up, and there wasn't a single complaint about the food among the attendees. only enthusiastic compliments and requests for seconds!<//text>< Pics>

<text>I crave this place! I cant believe  that there isn't more of these around. You get up and choose what you want by meats, veggies, noodles, then a bunch of soy and stir fresh sauces. They cook it in front of you. The quality is always amazing and fresh. The portions are what you make it. I stuff as much as i can and get so much leftovers.<//text>< rating>

I found a black hair embedded in my top, left tooth once I finished my plate!!!!! Only God knows how long it was there; super GROSS. (I had only veggies)

I told our waiter Ricardo, showed him the hair and he simply said, "OK" and took the napkin with the hair in it.

NO Apology,
NO Empathy,
NO Emotion what so ever...

He came back with the bill and said, "I gave you 20% off" and walked away. A bit of empathy would have sufficed... but that's what you get when you deal with ignorant people.

Customer Service SUCKS here.<//review>

It was okay. 1 bowl policy but you can return as often as you want. They had a decent selection of meat, shrimp ($2 more), beef, scallops, pork, chicken.fair amount of vegetables. For me, the sauces were a little bland. Sauces seemed to watered down. Garlic sauce was just liquid, no actual garlic pieces. But, we will more than likely return.< /review>

<Text>They raised the dinner $2 when the minimum wages went up so it's not as good of a deal that it used to be.. I try to eat outside of the city on San Diego to avoid this but for Mongolian BBQ there just isn't any other choice.  Of course the ingredients are great. You can make some great dishes with them

<text>This restaurant is definitely a try if you are new to Mongolian stir fry. They provide unlimited buffet where u can your bowl with unlimited noodles veggies protein and sauces. It is then stir fried in front of you on a huge pan. One bowl is more than enough for a person. I wouldn't recommend going for unlimited bowl option.</text><response>None</response><UserId.>103714638248768525696<//UserId.>< rating>

<Text>Love mixing my own choice of ingredients and sauce.  They added a coconut milk curry sauce that I can get enough of.   The all you can eat is a few dollars more than the plate option.  They have other items on the menu, but I always go for the pick your own meal.  Tropical tea is awesome.< /Text>< Name>

Such a great idea for a restaurant and they do their thing really well. A great selection of stir ins like vegies, meats, soy and noodles. You even get to practice alchemy and mix your own sauce for your stir fry. Large and open dining area and perfect for a families night out or for a good quick lunch. I will definitely frequent this place.< /Review>

I grew up across the street from Stir Fresh Mongolian Grill and have loved it ever since I first walked down the bowl prep line. If you like asian noodle dishes, I highly recommend you give this a place a try. If Sergio is still the manager; you will be in good hands. Stir Fresh has an excellent selection of meats, veggies and sauces in which you build your own noodle/rice bowl. You walk down a long island starting with meats to veggies and finally sauces. You then take your bowl up to a large flat cook top in which chefs prepare your meal right in front of you. Every time I go it is a different experience since it is up to me to create the dish and therefore I love to experiment and try different sauces.</text>

Parking is never an issue, and it's a fun experience that the kids enjoy (give a tip and ring the gong!). The food quality is great, and I love the customization. I usually pack my bowl pretty high and manage to take leftovers.
Do heed the signs for making your broth/oil. I lean towards the curry. Be aware that the BBQ Oil and Dragon Oil bring the spiciness up very quickly even in small amounts.
Overall, I have been here dozens of times over the years and it has never disappointed.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate><date>1516213427416< /date><name>Ron Irvin< /name><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

<Resp>None</Resp><text>Mongolian grill is my favorite restaurant. I've been to quite a few around the country. Some are better than others. This is one of the better Mongolian grill's I've been to. They have a good selection of meat and vegetables which include beef, chicken, pork, lamb, calamari, tofu, and too many vegetables to name. The sauce selection is good too. It can get busy but they are usually good about bringing in more cooks as needed. They do offer a military discount but make sure to ask about it before you get the check as I've had one cashier refuse to give me the discount after my waiter already printed the check. Overall though I highly recommend this restaurant. I would come here everyday if I could afford it and it was closer.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Great Mongolian style restaurant. Go through a serving line where you pile up all your favorite meat, veggies, and noodles onto your plate. Then top it off with some sauces. From there you give it to the cook who fries it up on a giant grill top. Always delicious and a great value. Highly recommended.< /Review><Response>None<//Response>< UserId.>

The last genuine Mongolian bbq in north county. I've been here many times over the years and love the food. The one negative is that within the last year or so the staff's (particularly one hostess/waitress) competence has declined to the point of annoyance. I'm not a high maintenance patron but I would like an occasional drink refill. And I can do without the sigh and eye rolling when I request more rice. Otherwise I would have assigned five stars.</Review>

The thing to know about Stir Fresh is that the food is as good as you make it. They give you fresh ingredients and a wide array of sauces, with an optional guide on what sauces to choose. The only time I've ever seen people not enjoy their food is if they were inexperienced and didn't follow the guide. Experimentation is great, but not for your first time.

The service is always good, the decor is a bit dated now, but things are always clean. I don't think the food is particularly expensive for what you get, and is as healthy for you as you want to make it.

Damn it, now I'm craving Stir Fresh...< /text>

<Text>Mongolian buffet is well worth it.  Fresh and fast.  We got the all you can eat (deluxe), but after watching other people fill their one bowl up to extremes we will be doing that next time.  All you can eat is really too much food and you cannot get a to-go container.   Good selection of meats, white fish, calamari and veggies.  Sauces were plentiful as well and are clearly marked for heat sensitivity.  Wish this place was closer to my home...I'd be going weekly!< /Text><Date>1470335815026</Date><Rating>5<//Rating>< Name>

<date>1542739834156<//date><review>UPDATE 2018-11-18: Brought my parents here.  They met us, and they loved it.  There were six of us and it was around $60.  Excellent price!  Everyone is really friendly and helpful.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

We recently stumbled upon some Mongolian Wok places in Los Angeles that were much better than the mall Great Khan experience, so we were glad to find a comparable place here in San Diego.  This location is a little far for us, but we figure it will be worth it about once a month to come here.

They offer a one trip plate where you can take your leftover home with you for 11.95 or for 2 dollars more you get unlimited trips, but cannot take your leftovers with you.

Each trip, you are allowed one bowl, and one small bowl for your sauces.  The Mongolian Wok in Los Angeles allows you 2 bowls (as far as I know) and you can put all noodles in one and all meats and vegetables in the other.  These options are not really needed if the line to cook your food remains short.  I only like these options when the line is long, and you just want to do most of your eating in one sitting instead of getting up multiple times.  Probably better for you though if you do get up.

My daughter ordered spaghetti for her meal.  Nice to have other options like these though we would have preferred she ate the same thing we did.
After about 5 minutes the waitress apologized that my daughter's food was taking a little longer.  Then again in 5 minutes she also apologized.  When she did bring it out, she told us it was on the house.  That was very nice of her, and I didn't feel like it took too much longer.

Our food was great, but the fish I tried I did not like.  It tasted very fishy, but maybe because I wasn't really in a fish mood?

Everything was great, and the cooks were so friendly.  Does it matter if the cooks are friendly or not?  Not entirely, but it makes a difference on your experience.

I didn't order any beer, but noticed they serve beer.  Maybe next time!

The only negative, if  I had to come up with one, is the parking lot spaces are so small.  You will see lots of open spots that you could not possibly fit into.<//review>< username>

Food was okay, it was crowded and people like okay food. I would recommend this place if one is the mood for all-you-can-eat Asian food, it's not bad but not great either. It's also on the expensive side if one doesn't know how to stack food in a small plate or paying for the buffet.<//review>

<Review>Awesome place! Food is great and the service is even better. Our server always remembers our entire groups drink order whenever we come.

The trick is grab two bowls. Use the spare to compact the food in the other bowl, then use it to build your oil flavors.

I love this place because i can make my food as spicy add I like. The dragon oil is awesome.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbf0d5bf547871:0x77e9ba4a5b732616<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We live about 30 min from Stir Fresh and went for lunch based on the reviews and "wow"...it was definitely worth it!  We were torn between the 'express' and 'deluxe' but chose the latter so we could make sure we tried everything.  However, after witnessing the massive filling and stacking of a single bowl by patrons after us, we'll take the express next time.  The food was well-marked, fresh, and very flavorful...we'll be back very soon!< /text>

<text>My biggest complaint is that the wait is too long to get your food cooked on the wok. The wok is big enough so that four people could be cooking on it at one time. There's an excellent assortment of meats and vegetables as well as numerous sauces but they really could work on keeping it cleaner during service. The last server that we had was extremely slow in getting are drinks and bread to the table. The price is not bad and if you're a big eater you can stuff yourself.</text>< pictures>

<review>Last couple times that I have went, my waiter, Alton H. was very very good. He was very attentive, and quickly refilled my water glass, rice, and pocket sesame breads. He is one of the best waiters I have seen at any restaurant in a ling time. The Food was very good, and it is worth getting the all you can eat. But, come hungry. Please note they can keep bringing the rice to you, as much as you want. But, if you get the all you can eat buffet, they will give you about 4 breads. If you want more, they will charge you a little bit for each pocket bread.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

What a great place for Mongolian. The food is very tasty and the prices are good. Only wish the bowls were a little larger. Once I got to the noodles my veggies had pretty much filled the bowl so the noodles didn't balance very well and I lost a bit on the way to the bbq.< /text>

Food was great, but not the value. You can pile up all the veggies and meat you can fit in a small bowl for one trip or do multiple trips for about $3 more. Once they cook all your frozen food down, it shrinks. You are left paying close to $16 for a small plate of food.< /Review>

I love this place.  Plenty of seating, great for groups.  Mongolian Style Food: pick your meats, noodles, vegetables and sauce and they grill it right in front of you.  Food come straight from the grill, so allow it to cool down.< /text>

My family and I love this restaurant so much.  I used to eat at the one in San Marcos and when it closed I thought my semi-permanent food craving would go unsatisfied forever.  As it turns out, the Stir Fresh in Rancho Bernardo is just as good and their sesame bread is even better.  I like to bite the top off of the bread and create a pocket with it and then fill it with my stir fry.  I definitely recommend it.<//review>

Good food.  Make sure to have them clean grill before they cook your food if you dont want it super spicy.  Also make sure to stack that bowl high.   It shrinks to 1/3 size when cooked.< /text>

The food and concept are great. Be ready to walk away stuffed, but you can really make some great creations. Unfortunately, its apparent that there are some budget issues going on here. The staff is extremely short. During a dinner rush, it takes much too long to be seated, even when there are ample amount of tables open. It can be cumbersome to flag down staff for a refill, or even to pay your bill. It took about 15 minutes just for us to get our check. This has been a staple in RB though so hopefully it stick around and works out the kinks!<//Text>

Pretty good food. You can either grab one plate or go all you can eat. You go to a salad-style food bar and put your ingredients in a bowl. Afterwards, you take the bowl to a huge circular grill where they cook it. If you want a big plate, you'll have to be skilled at packing your bowl!< /Review>

{'time': 1506725404070, 'text': "Jason,  Sorry about your bad experience at Stir Fresh.   Our grill is very large and therefore very difficult to have even temperature across the entire surface.  Therefore the cooks move around to utilize the hotter and then cooler parts of the grill.   We apologize for the unwanted spice in your food.  There is a sign at the start of the buffet line which warns guests of this possibility.  You may ask the cooks to scrape the grill prior to your meals being prepared or have them cooked in a separate wok altogether.  I honestly don't understand your comment of limited choices.  Stir Fresh offers Beef, chicken, pork, lamb, sausage, calamari, white fish, and tofu for proteins.  At least 15 different vegetable offerings which may change seasonally.  9 different sauces, 3 signature sauces, chili and sesame oils.   We are one privately owned restaurant, not a chain like Ghengis Grill.  We do not have several locations that would give us leverage in getting lower prices from vendors.  Therefore we chose the ingredients we offer so that we can keep consistency in quality, price, and availability."}< /Resp>

Disappointed. Not sure if it was normal or not but the cooks moved my stir fry around the grill in a circular motion behind all the others, constantly moving the food around the grill instead of leaving  it in one spot.   So my bowl ended up spicy due to the other bowl in front of mine, I don't really care but my wife and sons bowls had the same issue. They don't care for spicy food and so their experience wasn't  so great.  Also the options are very limited for meats and veggies and sauces.  I really wanted to like this place, we have been looking for one that will compare to Genghis grill, unfortunately this one wasn't it.< /Review>

All you can eat noodles, vegetables and a meat.  Cooked over a large grill.  If you are sensitive to spicy foods ask for them to clean the grill first.  If someone used a lot of spice on their food, your dish will pick that up when on the grill.</review>

I enjoy the food here. Great selection of sauces. If you bring kids here (and you should, it's fun) have them scrape down the grill before cooking the kids food because it can be spicy otherwise from previous guests' food.<//Text>

My favorite spot to eat in Rancho Bernardo. Here's a sauce tip: 2 Red curry, 1 teriyaki, 1 soy, 1 stir fresh, 2.5 yellow curry, 1 garlic, 1 ginger and 1 scoop of dragon oil for some heat. Enjoy!< /Text>

Great food. I love that you can add calamari and fish to your Mongolian BBQ bowl. The only downside is it is pretty expensive compared to other Mongolian BBQs I've been to, and the bowels are smaller. Also was hard to find with GPS. It was kind of hidden up the hill and our GPS kept rerouting until we gave up on it and roamed around ourselves.</review>

Amazing as usual. You like carbs? Fresh bread, noodles, rice, and selection of meats. Eating keto? Spinach, broccoli, squash, extra meat, and happiness. Service was good too. This place never gets old.<//review>

Food is quite good, but part of it is on you to pick the right combination of meats, veggies and (liquid) seasonings. If you don't like spicy, then get in front of any friends who do and watch those in front of you. What's on the grill in front of you definitely makes a difference because all the food takes a lap together. Personally, I like spicy but still adjust based on what I think is in front of me.
There are lots of, uh, "packing techniques" for getting two meals out of the "one trip" option (no take out if you choose "all you can eat"). A few of these are using a small bowl to hold the seasonings, packing down the frozen meat with said small bowl, strategically stacking your vegetables (alas, they don't have snowpeas), and using a few noodles on top to hold everything in place.
I struggled with 4 stars vs 5, but ultimately other than the variability, I always enjoy it here.< /text>

My first and last time there ... I went with my two kids at 1:30 on a Sunday and had to wait 20 minutes because only two servers working, even though half the place was empty ..  restaurant  was not clean..  food everywhere... on the floor and around the bins  where you add your vegees etc... horrible service ..  no fun at all... several people walked out cause the hostess was saying 25 minute wait... maybe she should have helped wait tables  instead!!! 👎🏼👎🏼</review>

Great buffet options available but I like that you can take home leftovers if you choose the non-buffet option. They should allow me to take an extra plate home for a slightly extra charge if I choose the buffet option!<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>My wife and I have enjoyed Stir Fresh in the past, but are unable to eat the large portions and then the leftover food goes bad before we finish it. We are health and environmentally conscious.  We do not over eat and we do not waste food. Today we went to Stir Fresh in Ranch Bernardo. We decided to split an $8.95 bowl (not the all you can eat!). Once seated with our friends we were told we couldn't split the plate. I was shocked. Imagine buying fries at McDonald's and being told you couldn't share?! Imagine buying a Panera sandwich and being told you couldn't let someone else eat part of it?! I spoke to the manager.  She was sympathetic, but said it was Stir Fresh policy that more than one person could not share an individual entree.  So my wife and I packed up two to-go boxes and left our friends at the table. We went home and ate. The principle, though, is that STIR FRESH DOES NOT TRUST ITS CUSTOMERS, DOES NOT SUPPORT HEALTHY EATING AND DOES NOT SUPPORT THE ENVIRONMENT (wastes food). We will never eat at such an archaic establishment again.  I encourage others to shun it as well. There are many places to purchase similar food that do not have an environment where the customer is NOT TO BE TRUSTED.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I would describe this Mongolian Grill as average and missing any of the bells and whistles the good ones have. The vegetable bar was missing many of the really good things like snow peas and bamboo shoots it had the standard low cost peppers onions and mushrooms and cabbage with a few extras but nothing really amazing. The oils were the bare minimum there were no spices to add there were no eggs that could be cracked in. They had the standard beef pork lamb and chicken with a couple of seafood things but there were no shrimp and no unusual Meats at all. They had an all-you-can-eat option but there were all these rules so it made it difficult. General cleanliness of the restaurant was a bit on the dirty side and needs an update. The guys that were running the Mongolian griddle use an unusual turning method where they pushed everybody's selections around the table for 5 times and kept walking around and around so the sauces from all the different people got mixed up I never saw them scrape the areas once. I don't think I will go back< /text>

<text>Great tasting food.  Put your ingredients in a bowl and have them cook on a Mongolian grill.  Lots of different ingredients to choose.  If you don't like what you get, no one to blame but yourself.<//text><date>1485232610860< /date>< userid>

Big portions, decent prices, just make sure to get 10+ scoops of sauce since cooking burns most of it off</Review>

Traditional Mongolian BBQ with a good selection of meat (lamb, beef, pork, chicken), veggies, noodles, and condiments.  The meals are served with Chinese sesame bread and steamed rice, too.< /review>

Good food, but if you don't like spicy be careful- the person ahead of you in line may spice up your dish. Mine was so spicy I could not eat it even though I did not add any spice.< /text>

Ok so most of my complaints are directed at the waitress. Never been there before. We walk in and someone tells us it will be a min before someone can sit us. So I said cool and ran to the restroom. When I came back, I figured my wife had gone to the restroom because I didn't see her so I waited at the entrance. About five minutes later, the waitress told me she sat us and showed me where. Our drinks were waiting. Wife came back and was like where are the menus? Apparently she took them back. We decided to just walk up to the bar and get our bowls. While we were up there the second time they took our drinks and silverware away. The waitress was kinda rude. She took her time refilling our drinks, removing plates and even bringing us the check. It was just a huge disaster. As for the food it was all fresh. The problem is none of the food marinated so it gets very little of the flavor of the seasoning. Also it was very hit and miss on how it was cooked. One bowl would be way under the next way over. Most the cooks seemed good but none spoke English well so it was hard to give special instructions. Like only cook the meat well done. Instead the noodles were nearly burnt. Also I feel they need other toppings. Especially egg! Over all I would eat there again. But just hope it's a better experience.<//Review>

<text>There is a ONE BOWL policy, meaning you are not allowed to use 2 bowls per turn regardless if you are doing the all you can eat. I didn't know this, and while I was getting food (2 full bowls in) a girl in a pony tail told me I couldn't do this. I didnt understand becasue ive been to other places like this and this isnt an issue, and naturally I was confused. So, I was trying to clarify what she was saying and I guess this annoyed her? Her jumbled exasperated explanation was truly off putting.

The issue should of been addressed by my waiter, because I saw other people doing it and the pony girl said nothing...

I don't care why there is a ONE BOWL policy and that isn't the problem. It's a buffet and being confronted by a nasty employee while doing the one thing your suppose to do is just unnecessarily stupid.

You can't use 2 bowls but what you can do is pile that one bowl as high as you want.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1526798094589, 'text': 'Other than the signage that is prominently displayed about our one bowl policy,  I can see your confusion. We have this so we might have a chance in keeping food costs manageable so that menu prices stay stable.  $13.50 for dinner that one can make so large in one bowl that it requires a to go box seems like a good deal.   Try doing that in any other Asian style restaurant.  As to "other places like this",  how many other full service Mongolian BBQs are in San Diego?  So if you knew there was a one bowl policy why are you upset?  So you acknowledge that there is one rule and you\'re upset that you an employee asked you not to break the one rule?  That is unnecessarily stupid.  Due to the ease of roasting establishments on the internet,  a basic way of conveying complaints is lost.   Had you called to talk to a manager or email and we would have listened to your experience and would have tried to make you happy.  But alas...  Bravo on your review of Soup Plantation next door. Well written.  Not often does a place get 4 stars about complaints of children screaming in the dining room and a lack of menu items....'}<//Response>< gmapID>

Great Mongolian grill. Pile up your ingredients and sauces watch them grill it up. Ring the gong.
Parking area spaces are too small, they need to redo those.< /review>

The lady at the front desk was a bit rude but she seemed busy atm so i rode it off to trying to get everyone taken care of. While she was off doing something before seating us a (what i assumed was) waitress showed us to a seat but then no one came over, gave a us a menu, asked us for drink orders, explained even how it worked as it was my first time (thankfully not for the person i was with so she explained it). After waiting a bit i finally went to the front desk to ask for a menu because no one came back to our table she went to go yell at the lady who sat us and rudely gave us a menu and didnt wait for me to see drink options just brought water. Set up is a bit confusing but the food was fantastic and saved the meal. I was extremely happy with the food. Bit of a wait but worth it. People on the floor just seem very scattered and not coordinated with each other and its very obvious. I might come back but definitely dont enjoy the first impressions given by the floor staff< /text>

I'm used to Mongolian BBQ. This was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Let's start with they have a small arrangement for choices to eat. No salad bar. All the veggies are cut WAYYYYY to big. All me food was still raw when I got my food back(I dont eat meat, so not talking about that), except the carrots and sprouts. Slim choices for sauce combinations and no seasoning are offered. The hostess was very nice. Explained everything to me, sat me down and brought my drinks to me. However NOT ONE TIME while I was eating did a server come check on me. I had to go to the hostess stand to ask for my bill. Left my plate full of my raw veggies barely touched anything. Couldn't even complain to any one if I wanted due to thr fact that no one payed no attention to me. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.<//Review>

{'time': 1506722629469, 'text': "Bryan, we apologize that your meals came out to spicy.  There is a sign at the start of the buffet line above the bowls that informs customers of this possibility and the option for meals to be cooked in the back kitchen in a separate wok.  Having a bar at Stir Fresh doesn't really fit with our concept of family friendly dining, we do serve beer and wine on our menu however.  Kids bowls have always been in same size bowls for $6.50.  Our most popular item which is the lunch express meal (one bowl) is $10.95.  Which we feel is a great value.  Most guests are able to pack the bowl enough to have some boxed up to take home.    Most burger or taco places cost close to that for less food.    Again, we're sorry you had a bad experience and we'd hope you come back and give us a chance to win you back."}<//Response>

Prices have risen but still just ok as long as you only like it spicey.
The spice from prior bowls contaminates the following people and you never know what you are getting.
Kids have refused to eat their food because it's so spicey even though they out none on their bowl, it just comes off the grill on your food.
Too unpredictable.
Even if you ask them to scrape it off before you it takes a long time and everyone gets mad.
Kid prices are now in tiny bowls.  No bar.
Better options elsewhere for $13 for lunch.< /Text>

Don't get deluxe bowl, that's too much food. Express bowl and pack it in. So delicious! Wish there were more in San Diego!< /Review>

This place is outdated and the food tasteless, also very expensive, they charge for everything, what a rip off.  The only thing that I would buy are the spring rolls which were the bomb.  I would never recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>

<text>Classic mongolian style (american version, anyway) food.  they cook it in front of you on a community grill.  If you don't like spice, make sure that the people in front of you didn't add too much dragon breath, or ask the chef to clean the grill before they cook your food.< /text>< pictures>

<resp>{'time': 1526796615206, 'text': "Sorry, but Stir Fresh is a buffet.  So unfortunately we have to implement rules.  They are not unreasonable.  Take one bowl to put your ingredients in, use a small bowl to put the sauces in.  Using this policy we are able to keep our prices stable due to food costs.  Would you go to say, Soup Plantation and complain about their buffet rules? If an employee was rude to you we would definitely want to know so we can discuss this with him/her.  But as far as our one bowl policy, it has been in place since Stir Fresh opened 20yrs ago.  We have seen guests build a meal so large using one bowl that they needed a to-go box to take the remainder home.  We actually encourage this because it is fun for the guest.  We think this is a great value for $13.50 express dinner.  All you can eat is $2 more, but you can't take home leftovers."}<//resp>< userid>

Server was unfriendly and closed earlier than posted time after my party entered. The meat selection was empty and staff watched me while doing nothing, but refilled the trays after my dish was cooked. After the tray was refilled, the grill was closed and would not serve anymore. The sesame bread was flat, cold, hard and tasteless.</Text>

{'time': 1517537095494, 'text': "After reading your review, I spoke with the server who assisted you last night.  While Stir Fresh apologizes that you had a bad experience,  there seems to be a few inconsistencies in your review of what had happened.  Your characterization of the server being unfriendly may stem from the fact that you decided not to follow the rules of our all you can eat option. He politely reminded you of the rules (which are clearly posted above the buffet) and which point you became agitated and ignored his request.  Rather than escalate the situation he chose not pursue the matter further.   Fifteen minutes before our posted closing time, the server informed your table that Stir Fresh would be closing soon and if you wanted to go for one more pass that you should do so.  The other two tables dining at that time did not seem to have a problem with our closing time.  Your description of the buffet is puzzling, but I will ask the staff again about the availability of items as you described in your review.  As for the complimentary biscuits we provide, I can't say what happened there.  This is the first complaint we've received about them.  The server who assisted you is a long time employee who is professional and is well liked by guests because of his friendly service.  I have no reason to question his account of what happened last night.  In the end,  Stir Fresh wants its guests to be happy.  If you feel our response is inadequate or inaccurate,  please feel free to call us and speak with a manager to address your concerns.\nSincerely,\nStir Fresh"}<//resp>

{'time': 1534119093534, 'text': 'Hi, Larry.  Thank you for your review.  Stir Fresh has 12 vegetables on the buffet plus firm Tofu.  We have many vegetarian regulars.  Is there something we can add to make our menu to make us more vegetarian friendly?  We welcome ideas concerning our buffet offerings in order to improve the Stir Fresh Mongolian menu.  If it was the communal grill that we use,  guests can always request to have their stir fry cooked in an individual wok in the back kitchen.  Thanks!'}< /response>

On a busy night you end up waiting in line for a very long time making the buffet experience a little bit difficult and frustrating. The food was okay although all of the meat was frozen.< /text>

<Response>{'time': 1517618817892, 'text': "Sorry for the long wait at the grill.  Guests seem to come in bunches at times on busy nights causing a backup on the grill.  Although there can be up to four or sometimes five people cooking, sometimes the rush can put a strain on wait times.  Also, the grill is periodically scraped clean which adds a few minutes to the cook time.  As for the meats,  all our beef sirloin, pork, chicken, lamb and sausage comes in fresh.  We freeze it in order to slice the meats thinly giving it that curled look so that it cooks quickly and evenly on the grill when mixed with the vegetables and noodles.  You'll find most,  if not all,  Mongolian grills prep their meat this way.  We hope that you give Stir Fresh another try in the future!"}</Response></record>

Very good food...only drawback is that they cook seafood in same surface so be careful if u have allergies like I do.<//Review>

<review>Being vegetarian, I kind of missed the point.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>
{'time': 1534119093534, 'text': 'Hi, Larry.  Thank you for your review.  Stir Fresh has 12 vegetables on the buffet plus firm Tofu.  We have many vegetarian regulars.  Is there something we can add to make our menu to make us more vegetarian friendly?  We welcome ideas concerning our buffet offerings in order to improve the Stir Fresh Mongolian menu.  If it was the communal grill that we use,  guests can always request to have their stir fry cooked in an individual wok in the back kitchen.  Thanks!'}<//response>

Empty tables in a restaurant do not necessarily mean that the staff is prepared to accept new guests.  Having such a large dining area here at Stir Fresh,  sometimes it is necessary to group patrons on one side or another so that the staff isn't spread too thin trying to attend to all the tables.  I have talked with the staff to work on ways that guests are attended to in an efficient, courteous manner so that wait times will hopefully be reduced or eliminated in the future."}</Resp>

<text>(Translated by Google) The food was good.
One point deduction for the ambience trimmed for flow, both at the counter, the presentation of the food and at the table.
A perfect place for a quick meal, also for many people!
