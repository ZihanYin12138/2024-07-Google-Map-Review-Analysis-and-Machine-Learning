< Review>
I took my foster husky to this shop to get groomed and to buy some supplies and food. The owner is so nice and full of information. The price is reasonable and fair, and they did a great job. The groomer is awesome! I’ll be back to purchase items for my cats in the future.<//Review>

Took my puppy to get a bath/groom and nail trim here and she came out looking beautiful! The staff is friendly, the price is fair and owner is so nice. This is definitely going to be my new place to take Lilo to get groomed. Lil even looks to be smiling after her groom in the pictures!< /Review>

Freddie is very friendly and always willing to listen and help. Our groomer seemed nice and noticed the hives on our newly adopted dog right away so that was a good sign. Thanks so much for the help!</Text>< pictures>

Owner is personable and knowledgeable about dogs and dog food. Groomers are also knowledgeable about schnauzer cuts and very professional
They are also very gentle with my 12 1/2 year old mini schnauzer.<//text>

<text>After a few poor customer experiences at a groomer near Fruitvale and MacArthur we thought we'd try Pet Choice. Best decision.
We are very happy with the skill of the groomers and the fact they are able to get our very difficult dog groomed. He hates having his nails cut but they are successful every time! The person at the front desk, Freddy, treats everyone like family.
Cannot recommend this place enough.<//text><Time>1596473035373<//Time><GmapID>0x808f8638b5cf27dd:0xe50640985848b7a< /GmapID><Response>None<//Response>< name>

<review>AVOID AVOID AVOID. 6 hours for my 15lb mini goldendoodle! They kept her in a cage (according to themselves and as if it's nothing) thestylist (girl with dreadlocks) is incredibly slow, unsanitary, extremely poor at her job. Owner kept saying "she is a nice person" and I won't disagree with that. She might be a nice person. She is terrible at this job. After 6 hours they didn't give me a call, I went there to find my dog with have a half way done a uneven buzz cut! My dog is extremely exhausted and scared. Do yourself a favor and don't make my mistake. Pay a little more but go somewhere they know not only a dog but even a human can't take 6 hours long haircut. Btw, when I asked to give me my dog back as is. She kept the door closed, didn't reply to me neither the owner! She didn't respond to my requests of letting go of my dog for a good 5-10 minutes. Extremely stressful and sketchy.</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Pet Choice is my go-to for supplies for my cats. Definitely a hidden gem. The owner, Freddy, is the nicest person! He remembers the things I tell him about my cats, asks how school is going, and always offers to help carry things to the car. He occasionally gives me free toys or treats for the cats, which they certainly appreciate.</review>

Pet Choice on MacArthur is my go to shop for all my kitty needs. The owner is incredibly nice, so nice that I always leave the store in a better mood than when I entered. He has random give-always (of good stuff!) and is an excellent source of advice and referrals.
One of my cats has special dietary needs, the brand of cat food isn’t commonly found at smaller pet stores. I heard through a neighborhood group that the owner will special order pet supplies if requested and that he matches or beats most big-box prices. Turns out, they were right! If I call in my order by mid-day Wednesday I can usually pick up Thursday afternoon.
Prices are as good, if not better, than the big retail chains. I have not used grooming services but have been on site and seen the handling and treatment of animals and feel good fully endorsing this store and it’s owner. The decor is a little funky but the service is first class. :)<//review>

I walked in minutes before close and the gentleman was starting to lock up. When he saw me heading toward the store, he opened the gates and welcomed me in and told me to take my time. He was able to get me the flea medicine I needed and he even sold it in individuals which was nice. He took the time to explain to me how to use the product, down to even when and when not to wash my dog in order to not waste the treatment. I love that even after being closed, the owner took time to not only get me my product, but teach me how to properly use it and not waste my money. Wonderful shop, good selection, will most certainly be back!!< /Text>

I Called just to know about the prices and the man who answered talked very low and had a very STRONG accent so I ask about 3 times what he was saying really nice I asked and he started yelling at me “NOW DO YOU HEAR ME , YOU HEAR ME KNOW” first of all That’s rude do not talk to me like that I was being very pelite . I don’t know if he was the owner or an employee but he literally just snapped and went off that’s not how your supposed to treat your customers.
I will NEVER EVER be coming here and will NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL ❌❌❌❌❌🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♂️< /text>

A neighborhood gem. great and affordable grooming services and they carry the grain-free brand of food our dogs enjoy at a competitive price and right in the laurel!

The owner is very friendly and knowledgeable.

I hope that with time the store itself will make some physician improvements since the building it quite old but otherwise, we love pet choice.< /Review>

I asked for a price for what I needed...Person on the phone, told me the price then preceded to demand angrily... if I did not agree to the price then he would not book me because he is a logical person...huh?? um mkay?? His tone   on the verge of scolding for no apparent reason.  Prior to that he would not work with me for scheduling a date...he wanted to schedule a time and date that worked best for him. Would not recommend to any of my friends for lack of customer service. First impressions count Pet Choice.<//text>< Pictures>

I decided to try this little shop out instead of the usual commercial chain I take my dog to to get groomed and I'm glad I did!  The owners of the store are there every day, and are very knowledgeable and helpful. They had my shihtzu bathed, trimmed, and groomed exactly how I wanted in a couple short hours. Great place!</text>

Great pet foods, very friendly staff, locally owned, super convenient and sometimes even cheaper than the chain stores.</text>

< Review>
This is the best pet store around. Also a dog grooming service.  The owner Freddie is awesome. If you claim to suppport local business and have a pet this is the best option. The owner Freddie has lived in the Laurel district over 20 years. Most importantly these days is the prices. They Can't Be Beat!!
CHEAPER than Amazon. CHEAPER than PET FOOD EXPRESS and PETCO. Often people go out of they're way for convince and don't even price check or just order off amazon cause "its easier" this place always has some quick parking unlike the rest of MacArthur blvd. I fear that without the local communities support this wonderful local long standing business could go under so to big name stores and people just assuming his little shop will be more expensive. My 50lb bag of taste of the wild is 3.20 cheaper than on Amazon, I used to buy at pet food express before I found Freddie. I was paying 3 dollars and change more. Same with tread and dog grooming accessories. Seems small to us the consumer where we buy dog/cat food etc. but that support is huge to a local bussines owner. I support local business owners.

Nice field complex. Bathrooms are well kept. Fields are nice quality. One field is a bit smaller than the other. I think the south one is the small one. Goals and nets are nicely in tact as well (for now).<//review>

Thank you Palo Alto for providing adult soccer players a place to play. Don't recommend slide tackling here unless you like big raspberries.</review>

< Review>
Traffic flow is terrible. Kids are trying to walk to parked cars or riding bikes while people are stopping in random places to drop off and pick up. It's amazing kids don't get hit every day</Review>

Would like to have better side barriers (why should a soccer ball leave the field less than head high and travel across a parking strip onto 4-lane Oregon Expressway?)< /Review>< Pics>

We had the best time staying at this quaint b&b!  We really enjoyed the wine and cheese hour (every day from 6pm to 7pm).  They do have the best chocolate chip cookies in the lobby as well.

Angela's cooking is the wonderful!  We really enjoyed her fresh breakfast every morning.  We stayed in the enchanted room and we loved the fact that it was so close to the back parking lot.

Overall, I would highly recommend!  It is truly a great location and at awesome prices.< /Review>

The best BNB I have seen in my life. Absolutely lovely place and staff, I will recommend it to everyone I know, even random strangers. The sun room is comfy as heaven. 5 minutes walk from the restaurant area of Napa. Just a lovely place. 10/10 would reserve again.</Review>

For the couple who is in empty nest training.. OR just wanting to get away... this is the perfect place to practice!  Clean and beautiful with full growth trees shading the courtyard and a couples tree swing to go with it.  The hosts... alas.. are what we all aspire to in our relationships... they served us a beautifully presented breakfast with pleasant conversation and sweet memories.  We brought our bikes and took advantage of the rail trail and the nightlife of Napa.  I highly recommend this B&B as it is snuggled in the residential section of Napa and it's classic beauty gives you a taste of the past.  And for all those shy of the recent fires in the area... I want to assure you that this area is alive and well... as beautiful as it has always been.  I definitely recommend visiting!  Ask for the Carriage House... you will love the cozy robes... I promise you won't want to leave.</review>

<date>1581965085966<//date><name>Jeremy Laurin< /name><review>This was such a wonderful find! The place was super cute. We stayed in the East loft and we had a fireplace and in room jacuzzi. It was truly romantic, especially since we could bring our little pup. The staff were all lovely, including the resident inkeeper Kadie. She made sure that we were well taken care of and was super kind to all the residents, giving us all tips on where to go and things to see (thanks Kadie). You get to interact with people (and puppies) from all areas and locations in the parlor and also have great breakfast there as well (the French toast was tasty & the granola is like yum!). The place is easily walkable to downtown, of which we did each night for dinner. We are thankful for Kadie and the rest of the staff and highly recommend a stay at Beazely house.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Room was quite alright. Cleanliness is the major problem. Carpet was not clean. Bathroom was too small to turn your body around in there, even for a woman. Bed was comfortable, though. But in general they were quite stingy on the basic amenities provided in the room.

Staff seemed obviously dismissive (and just laughed it off to the best) to comments/problems or any situation guests may have. On the surface, they might appear quite OK. That's actually unprofessional and disrespectful.

Breakfast was OK, I guess. Muffins, I was told, however, were quite good. We were given a big pot of coffee without being asked. And we don't drink coffee. That's a bummer.

There are nice rose bushes  in the garden.

Parking lot of the B&B is quite good, though others who don't stay there drove in and used it, too.

Housekeepers (maids) really need to be improved.

Not quite satisfied with our stay. Would not come back.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I can’t wait to come back! What a fabulous place! We stayed with our dog and were made to feel so welcome, there was even a doggy welcome pack and a list of dog friendly restaurants in our room. The garden is stunning! When we got up for breakfast and walked through the garden there was a pet friendly table set up for us. The hosts are divine and the location is great with restaurants in walking distance. Absolutely loved staying at Beazley House!!</Text>

<rate>5</rate><review>We had a great stay at the Beazley House for our 30th anniversary. It is conveniently located on 1st Street, just outside of the fun downtown of Napa. A lot of what made our trip fun was the careful planning and attention that Michelle gave us in helping us create an itinerary. The breakfasts were tasty and the gardens outside our room just beautiful. The room we stayed in was homey and comfortable. A great stay all around.</review>< pictures>

Our third stay here. We really enjoyed our first visit, the second visit was still pretty good. This visit was a great disappointment. The room smelled like dirty socks. The spa tub did not work, electric plug in the bathroom did not work. Wife had to use hair dryer in the main room. When we told the staff of the issues, they just shrugged and said “that’s to bad”.<//Text>

<review>It's a nice little B&B with friendly staff, though not as knowledgeable about the valley as I would have hoped, I'm a local, so didn't need it myself. It was nice that they brought in Cosentino Winery to pour on Saturday night and had beautiful stemware for the tasting. I also loved that I could get a bottle of Truchard Rousanne to take with me to my holiday party, a very convenient extra little perk!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

What a great experience, Tina took or reservation and also checked us in days later. She couldn't have been more helpful. She offered suggestions of restaurants in the area as well as winery's to visit. All of her suggestions were excellent. Victoria cooked us some great breakfasts each morning, in fact she came in 30 minutes early on Sunday because we had an early flight. We stayed in The Master Suite and enjoyed the large room with comfortable king bed and especially the fire place. Hope we get back there soon.</text>

Do yourself a favor, and stay at Beazley House!

We stayed 3 days in this beautiful old house. From the moment we arrived everyone was great! The room (Blossom View) super cozy and QUIET!!! The only thing you hear are birds during the day and crickets in the night. So peaceful! Breakfast is made with love as everything else. We asked for a gluten free menu and all we ate (sausage, spinach souffle, cake) was delicious. All our stay in Napa, for this 1st wedding anniversary, was made extra special thanks to the Beazley House where we felt comfortable, relaxed and taken care of! We will definitely go back! Thanks BH!!!</text>

<Review>I highly recommend the Beazley House.  My husband and I (and our dog) felt very pampered by the owners and staff.   The house is clean and comfortable, the flower gardens are amazing and the location is very convenient if you plan to spend time in downtown Napa (a ten minute walk).  Breakfast was delicious and it was a treat to be able to enjoy it outside in the garden area.  We hope to return again in the future and stay longer.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

While wineries are the stars of the Napa Valley, plush B&Bs are close behind. Among the many choices in Napa, Beazley House is a standout. Immaculate inside and out, hosts Jim and Carol Beazley have created an oasis of comfort and gracious hospitality.  Kathy, Debbie and all of their thoughtful and caring staff spare no effort to make your stay enjoyable. The beautifully-prepared breakfasts make it more than worthwhile to get up each morning. It's obvious that those who operate this standout B&B love what they do. We highly recommend the Beazley House.</Review>

< Review>
Had an amazing stay at the Beazley House with my wife this past weekend. The Blossom View room we stayed our first night was fantastic, as well as the Wedgwood room we stayed in the rest of our stay. Needless to say we had a great experience and would choose the Beazley House for our stay in Napa over any major hotel chain. The staff was very accommodating and professional, Meagan was very helpful throughout our stay and we had fun during the wine tasting each evening. We will be back....Thanks again Beazley House for a romantic and fantastic stay.</Review>

Charming bed and breakfast that is pet friendly.  We stayed in the garden room, which has its own courtyard and is perfect for a small dog.  The breakfast was also spectacular.  It could use some updating, but given the location and amenities of is hard to beat.< /text>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>Great location and atmosphere but slightly dated decor and old furnishings. I understand the need to keep the charm and character of the house and associated structures but things inside were just old and used. We stayed in the carriage house West Loft and the mattress of the bed was so old it almost folded in the middle when we would lay on it. The bathroom in the loft has walls that don't go up to the ceiling so if someone uses the toilet you can hear everything...

The breakfast is served during a fairly short window of 9-1030 which we had to miss because of a tasting we had scheduled 45 minutes away at 10am. It sounded and smelled excellent and was not a boring continental style that other places have - the hosts cooked for everyone who stayed for it.

Lastly the location is pretty great and near the downtown Napa attractions. We walked to a restaurant and saw many more on the way.</Text>< Time>

Sometimes very large people experience "soft top" mattresses differently than others. Breakfast at our inn is offered between 9 to 10:30, as nearly all of our wineries don\'t offer tastings before then. When guests tell us of a need for an early breakfast we make every effort to accommodate them.'}< /Response>

<Review>The Beazley House was absolutely delightful. The house is so charming and quaint. We adored the amazing breakfast, nightly wine hour, onsite gardens, coffee mugs for sale, and especially the warm and knowledgeable staff, they truely made it feel like we were long lost friends stopping in for a visit. Highly recommend staying at the Beazley House while exploring Napa.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

This quaint B&B in Napa is perfect if you are looking to get spoiled by your hosts, Jim and Carol.  The historic Mansion (circa 1902) has been transformed into a warm and cozy B&B. Stay in one of the rooms in the Mansion furnished with antiques or in the Carriage House overlooking their gorgeous English style gardens. Their breakfasts are amazing and the homemade granola is delicious! Good location, close to Napa's downtown riverfront area where you can shop, dine, and taste wine!<//review>

(Translated by Google) We really only wanted to stay one night and we stayed in the room "Wedgewood". Upon arrival we were personally welcomed, everything was shown to us and the team was very friendly and helpful! The breakfast the next morning was great! Above all, the coffee was very good :) then we spontaneously decided to stay one night longer because the Napa Valley and town is really nice and because the prices in San Francisco, our next stop, almost brought us tears have driven our eyes ... Since our room was booked, we got an upgrade to the beautiful garden house! It was really a dream. Again any time! You feel welcome and cared for, you meet the other guests at the evening wine hour and it's just pure relaxation!

Vor allem auch der Kaffee war sehr gut :) dann haben wir uns spontan entschieden, eine Nacht länger zu bleiben, weil das Napa Valley und das Städtchen wirklich schön ist und weil die Preise in San Francisco, unseres nächsten stops, uns fast die Tränen in die Augen getrieben haben... Da unser Zimmer aber ausgebucht war, haben wir ein upgrade ins wunderschöne Gartenhaus bekommen! Es war wirklich ein Traum. Jederzeit gerne wieder! Man fühlt sich willkommen und umsorgt, man trifft die anderen Gäste bei der allabendlichen Weinstunde und es ist einfach Entspannung pur!<//Text>

<Response>{'time': 1441135188322, 'text': 'There are always two sides in any dispute. The Beazley House version is supported by FACTS, however. Ms. Trujillo booked on July 7th under a different last name. Our research however clearly shows she cancelled 6 days later on 13 July. The next day she received a full refund minus our clearly stated $35 cancellation fee.  To BOOK her room, Ms. Trujillo voluntarily gave us a credit card number. She was immediately sent a confirmation with the cancellation fee clearly noted. There was no "holding" this room, it was booked. Ms. Trujillo states she spoke to three different people about a refund she was issued the very next day after cancelling her room. We have no record of these alleged calls.'}< /Response>< gmapID>

I love these owners, friendly, awesome, hardworking! They organize fun social gatherings. They bring THE BEST musicians in all of Kern County. They will even make you a pot of coffee if your not a drinker. Anyone visiting Kern River Valley should stop by to see who they may have performing or even just get a drink and relax.< /review>

Nice friendly atmosphere where you can enjoy a good drink, entertainment,  old friends and even make some really good new ones. On top of all that, the owners and staff are absolutely the best. They make you feel welcome there and that they have known you for years. After managing one of the best bikers' bar in Palm Springs, Joe's World Famous Saloon, for many years until the city took it in 2002 by eminent domain for a parking lot, it was a blessing to walk in here. It brought back a lot of great & fond memories of a place that I and many others thoroughly enjoyed miss but now have a new place to create loads more fun and memories.<//text>

The level of the quality of talent was off the charts, playing awesome classic and hard rock, then I find out they’re a local band. These guys should be touring!! A great Friday night, stayed nearby at a quaint little motel, so was able to really enjoy the night. Hope to be heading back real soon to be completely wowed all over again!! Great bar tenders, and was fortunate that night to meet the owners, a couple of very cool people, and they’re even married!! Lol, highly recommended!!</Review>< pictures>

Don't advertise as a great place to watch Nascar. It's not!

There was a  African American man with a bun who told me about the mask rule, which I understand but I didn’t know it was reinstated on Sunday. I came up to ask him a question very politely (6 ft apart) and he told me “you don’t have to run up on me, try that again and see what happens” . At that point I felt threatened but kept my cool. As I walked away he stared me down and started mouthing rude slurs at me. The people helping me at register were very nice and understanding.</review>

The worst customer service, ever!!! This store is in a great location and with office depot closed its the only office supply store in the area- yet they treat the customers awful!.  The checkout line was 8 people deep and the "greeter" , who was constantly on his phone and leaning on the display and ignoring everyone.  Finally someone had to ask him to help.   You know its bad when the lone clerk didn't even ask him for help.

The inside is filthy!  Trash on the floor, carpets unvaccumed.  Shelves are prett neat.

The store has no energy-may as well ve a 7-11.<//Text>

The other day I came in exhausted from work and holding my urine for over 6 hours. The cashier was working by herself in the copy and print section. All I wanted was my graduation pictures laminated for this years photoshoot. I’ve graduated three times in a roll 2018, 2019, and now 2020. She did an amazing job thank you 😊.<//Review>

<Text>Go to another staples, target,  or best buy!

I went in yesterday to find me a usb drive for a xbox360, the guy recommended one. I went home tried putting it in and it was not working. So I went back today to ask for a refund or exchange for one that works for my Xbox. The "manager" said it works, I just need to format it. So I went home Google what he was talking about. "Formatted it" and my xbox is not recognizing it STILL.  this is so annoying and frustrated.  I do not recognizing this store. They will not give you the appropriate tools for what you need, and when you try to get a refund they make it seem like you do not know what your doing. JUST GIVE ME A DAMM COMPATIBLE USB DRIVE FOR MY GAME!!!

Never returning.< /Text><Rate>1<//Rate>< pictures>

<text>I've been to this store a few times.  It's in a great location just a few blocks away from LAX airport.  I had never had any problems.  They've actually never been very busy.  I went today with a pretty large order for custom copies.  Angela in the Copy Center was very professional.  I was delighted that before she checked me out she looked through five pages of discount coupons to see if I could save some money on my $250 order.  She did.  Later, when I went to pick up the copies there was another nice man in the department.  I was very pleased.<//text>< name>

Manager needs to learn customer service skillsets to retain business customers.
Went in to buy $100 in HP ink and had a coupon they email out as a regular customer. The coupon had expired by a couple of days as I had been traveling for biz.
Manager (Ronnie?) could not be bothered to say " hey no problem- we appreciate your continued business". I have had other managers at this store over ride coupons before.
Too bad- found the inks at Amazon at a lower price and NO tax.
Staples- You lose... a valued customer. I'll be shopping elsewhere now.< /review>

Poor customer service.  I visited this location in search of a computer desk for my home office after calling and being told that there were many options to choose from in the store only to get there and find out that was completely false as the inventory was low and most options were out of stock. Not to mention that although there were hardly any customers at all being the day after Christmas and all yet I still had to ask for assistance because none of the reps even acknowledged my existence after searching for twenty minutes. After finally asking one of the reps he leaves to search the back, takes forever just to let me know that the desk I was interested in he "thinks they might have one left in the back" (which I thought that's what he went to confirm while he was gone) then when I asked about the floor model he says:" let me get the manager to see if he knows" walks away and after waiting again for too long I just left and went to Target. I definitely will Not be returning to this store.<//review>

I stopped by this Staples to return a planner my wife got me , because I had purchased almost the identical one earlier and already wrote on it. Anyways, I was treated like I was a thief and denied my store credit(my wife lost her receipt, I carry the business card and had used it for my planner). I was going to probably spend an extra 100 on a paper shredder that needed. Instead now I'll just order off Amazon. No wonder Retail is losing the battle. I was trying to be supportive,  No thanks to Miguel and Vanessa. I wont be a Staplea customer anymore!< /text>

Absolutely horrible experience here. I arrived right as the store opened, knocked on the door because it wasn’t opening automatically, and got yelled at for apparently showing up on time. Horrible management; I strongly suggest finding another store. There’s plenty nearby</Review>

< Review>
The worst Staples I've ever been to.

I've been coming here for over 5 years because it's the closest one to me and there aren't many more in the area.

The store and bathrooms (which you now need the passkey for) are filthy and worst of all I think the employees move purposely slow -- especially at the Copy & Print Center.

At all other Copy & Print Centers, you can usually make a same-day or next-day order, here you generally have to do it 2 days in advance if you place it online.

Then when you get checked out, the transaction will take forever (because of both the cashiers dragging their feet and the delays with the computers).

And good luck trying to get help if you're by the fax or copy machines.

On top of that, I was just overcharged today.

It just might be time to start driving the extra distance to go to the better locations.</Review>

I asked her if she was short staffed and she explained that her colleague had been unwell. We were impressed how she was still in such great spirits and with a smile on her face. Greeting each customer that walked through the door, telling them she would be with them soon. Really superb customer service!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Nice place to chill and make some phone calls on the patio. The crew of employees they have in there are pretty cool. Not a fan of the sweet pepper bacon breakfast sandwich, but the $1.50 medium iced moca is a good deal.</Text>

Sad place to go. There's not much there in San Clemente to go at night. If you go there make sure is daylight. Otherwise you'll be doing s-h-i-t at night. Back to DD.....average place, below average coffee...ok if nothing else is available. Otherwise keep driving and go to another coffee store.<//Text>

This is a well situated dunkins off the five freeway in San Clemente.  Great stopping point on the drive between san diego and los angeles.  Deserted parking lot out back if you need to make a call or something.</review>

Good donuts but they don’t fill the coffee cups properly. We ordered cappuccino several times, and the cup was always more than a third empty.< /Text>

Stop by around 10am for Doughnuts just to find out that they don't have that many probably about 20 so I asked for a Bagel, to my surprise they are out, how long they are planning on staying on business if 3 or 4 customers just walk out with out getting anything?</review>

<Text>I'm a tried and true New Yorker. Dunkin Coffee. Forgetaboutit. Not BITTER, like the other joints. But super smooth. Amazing taste. Donuts baked not boiled in delicious Oil👎.  And the staff super kind and amazingly courteous. If your their for a while theyl l come around and offer to top off your coffee.</Text>< time>

I asked if I could have a vanilla bean instead, no problem, until they tell me they were out of vanilla bean. So, I asked for a strawberry coolatta, no problem. Then they tell me they were out of strawberry...really??? So, I asked for the watermelon but add more flavor. It was ok.< /Text></record>

Was in for the grand opening, VERY corporate! The donuts are small and chewy - ish (weird). I'm sure they are weighed to the oz. and corporately monitored lol...I was kinda grossed out when the person getting my donuts literally put their bare hand down in the bag to open it rather than fanning the bag or using tongs or something 😬.. Cold environment for sure.. The service is super slow but everyone is new so hopefully they will learn.  NOT IMPRESSED ..

The little donut shop in the Stater Bros plaza closer to the freeway blows this away!!!!</Text>

This DD location is kind of hard to find unless you're either walking, have been here before, or are at a complete standstill. Other than the lack of signage, everything else was great.< /text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Never Again with Yamaha Cucamonga
I called customer service and I placed an order online, then I was told my item will be shipped 5 days after the payment which is fine with me.

2 weeks later I checked on my order online and status said "PAID", I sent an email asking for an explanation but no answer, I called and the same person who told me the first instruction now he's telling me different instructions, he said "NO your item is not ready and we do not control the warehouse shipping and I cannot tell you when you will receive it"
Are you kidding me? you wasted 2 weeks of my time letting me waiting for my item and now you are saying you don't know when it will arrive...
Why did you give me wrong information and telling me the item is in stock?
Anyway I just cancelled my order and the sad part is they did not even care about the cancellation or trying to keep me as a customer... All what HE said you will receive a cancellation email which I never did anyway

Good bye Yamaha Gucamonga I promise that you will not get any business from me NEVER EVER</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Hands down the best pricing for any Yamaha motosport or power equipment. Some accessories can be purchased elsewhere online and you can save a few bucks but not by much. Their service shop is very knowledgeable and will explain everything in great detail. So just swing on by and give this place a shot. Talking to them to person will usually get you the best deal.< /Text>< pics>

<username>J N< /username><review>Needed service on my motorcycle and called the dealerships in my the area that I was willing to ride to.  Yamaha of Cucamonga was the only one that said they had the part in stock and at a reasonable price.   Best choice I made.  Not only did they do it in the time quoted, it was cheaper than I thought it was going to be.  Will definitely be going there for my other service needs.< /review><time>1492208882674<//time>< gmapID>

<Text>I was told 1 week to do a injector cleaning, mainly for the new seals to get delivered. It has been 4 weeks and still they say "we will be getting to it tomorrow", or "your bike is on the schedule for tomorrow". My mechanic said 2 weeks til they could get to my bike, and Yamaha said 1 week, i know now not to believe Yamaha ever again. I will not be returning, hopping i ever get my bike back.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

The last time  I brought my bike in wa for their oil change special was about a few years back. I haven't been back since because they didn't put enough oil.  I realized it when I was riding to work and I was going up a hill and the oil light went on. Not the  best thing to happen at 430 in the morning. When I leveled off the light went off. Got home and added some oil problem solved. Can't trust them anymore.< /Text>

<review>I live in Hawaii and ordered a service manual for the Yamaha VStar through their website (Yamaha part number LIT-11616-XV-26). It shipped and arrived in less than 3 days! They had the best pricefor this service manual and one of the best valued shipping (Less than $10 for 3 day shipping to Hawaii). Highly recommend buying parts from them online! I will buy my parts through their online website again!</review><resp>None</resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rate>

I took my warrior 350 there they charged me over $500 for a carburetor tuneup and other minor things. But what's more convenient is that I've had to take it back three times because they don't know what they're doing I would recommend going to another Yamaha or even berts mega mall<//text>

I have been bringing my motorcycle here for 5 years.  I have never had any problems with the employees.  My ride is always finished when they say it is going to be done. On 3-23-13 I brought my bike in due to a loud squeeking in the forks.  I advised the owner and his son Clint that I was just in less than 2 months ago for a tune-up and for all the front end bearings to be re-greased.  I told them that the noise started about a month after the service.  They told me not to worry that they would take care of it at no charge.  I left the bike there at 9:00 am and went back at 4:00 pm to my ride being fixed.  Turns out after the grease settled in the neck, it created some air pockets causing the squeek.  If you have ever had this service done you know it is expensive and takes all day.  No questions asked, even without knowing for sure what the issue was, they took care of it, on them.

Keep up the good work!< /Text>

I ordered a part from their website and what I received was completely different from what they pictured yet I was expected to pay to ship the part back to them in order to accommodate their screw up. Instead I'll just find what I need on eBay through someone else.</Text>

<Review>Took my bike in for warranty work and they only got half of it done. The work was done properly but the bike was given back with large scratches on the frame, (which they claim were already there... B.S.!!!) left side cover, rear fender and the shift pedal got bent as well. The fuel tank got damaged also but they did take responsibility for it and had it repaired and painted, this had to be done twice but I removed the tank and dealt with the paint shop the second time. They did offer to handle it the second time, but I declined for fear of having the bike scratched further. In short they're good guys but they don't sympathize to customer needs and concerns, their work standards and attention to detail are very low. If you treasure your ride, stay away from here.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<text>I was rear ended at a red light and had damage done to my bike. All cosmetic. Tailpeice and some dings here and there, and a dent on my gas tank which was white. I took my 14 r6 so it could get repaired. But when I came to pick it up not only was I surprised that the gas tank was now red but they had forgotten to put on the emblems that I clearly paid for on the now red gas tank. They also didn't put back on the rear reflectors that I had put on my bike to prevent future tickets. It has become an incovienece now since they refused to put the emblems them selves and I need new reflectors for my bike now. It also irritated me that they took it upon themselves to chose for me what color gas tank I wanted on my bike. I brought them my bike with a damadged white tank and I wanted it repaired so why give me a red tank.? That is besides the point that I now have to finish what I paid them to do and put the emblems on myself but I now need to get new reflectors. The only good thing was that they were friendly and concise with their information of how much everything would cost.</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c3367f3dc03485:0x3e0f89aebeb14db4< /GmapID></record>

I ordered a small part for my Jet boat on thursday before 4th of July weekend. I paid an extra $71.00 to have the part shipped  next day  ups AM! No part friday, no part sat... sunday and monday closed. I spoke to shane who was chipper but not helpful.  I simply go a refund because the parts cucamamonga yamaha send they dont have in stock as advertised on the web,  so orders are sent from yamaha... so why wouldnt we just order from yamaha and save a couple bucks and not have to deal with surfer bro's that only work 4 days a week. there are better prices on the web, only placed my order with cucamonga to have the part shipped next day, and that was clearly a mistake.< /text>

I agree don't bring your precious toys here. I was in Afghanistan when I had everything scheduled and had my bike towed. I sent an email of everything I wanted specifically and not everything was done. Their responses took forever so coordination was slow. Bike had a few scratches. New exhaust had scratches on magnesium. No regard for details. The don't clean around the area of a new install, they install over dirt. They didn't detail my bike like i asked so I had to take a day of R&R to detail it. They installed a Rizoma reservoir and left the old mount of the old reservoir just hanging on the break line. There was junk inside the brake fluid I could see through the clear window. No clamps on the hoses that went to the reservoir. A filler fender was installed incorrectly. One of my HIDs no longer worked after it left. The rear hugger was left loose and a screw was missing. The rear sets where left loose and installed incorrectly. The clutch lever came loose and I lost all engine breaks and almost killed myself. It came off coming to a light that changed suddenly on me. I went to my original mech and he found everything loose. Where the rod connects to the bike it was also loose, no lock tight was used. The bikes map was adjusted and I had a rough idle and the bike would stall, they adjusted it again and it takes forever during a morning start up. I canceled everything else I had on order there, i refuse to give them anymore of my money. They knew they almost killed me since I emailed the service guy Jay Conway. I had to go back to get my HID kit fixed which was never fixed and not even an apology was extended. Numerous people told me after the fact not to use Rancho but to go to Fontana Yamaha.<//review>

<Time>1276834697280</Time><text>I brought my mint 03 R6 Black red flame special edition. "pre raven" here for a rear wheel. I told them I was very obsessive about my bike and told them to **** my girl but dont scratch my bike. First thing remove brake caliper and swing over fully exposed swing arm. I asked dude to use a cloth as to not have metal on metal. He said no scratch extra protective paint....if it does I will fix it. I said its not about fixing it is about doing it the right way. Then he lays the chain over the left unprotected swing arm, latching it on the end corner. I asked again to use a cloth. Owner yells to tech to reinstall old wheel and get my bike out. He scratched my black powder coated rim and left a good 3.5 inches of slack in the chan. The owner then puts all the weight of bike on kickstand and pivots bike 180 degrees. This scratched my gas tank and rear body panel, not to mention the torque on the stand. I was cussed out and threatened with a wrench. DO NOT BRING YOUR PRECIOUS TOYS HERE!!<//text><gmapID>0x80c3367f3dc03485:0x3e0f89aebeb14db4< /gmapID>< name>

<Review>They aren't there to help you. Over priced parts, don't know what they're talking about, and they sound like you're inconviencing them when you call. They tried to tell me a new stator for a 2002 R6 would be $600. Bought a genuine Yamaha stator online for $178. Screw this place.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Text>Very nice outing. The horses look well and maintained.  The guide was friendly.  We did not have to ride in a single  line. The scenery  is was beautiful to the eyes.

< Review>
We are  former horse owners looking to re-connect with the experience of riding. We’ve been on three rides in the area, and CCT is by far the best. Head and shoulders above the rest. Well-cared for animals, passionate business owners, guides are always keeping an eye on you and know the horses really well, lots of fun, relaxing ride.  If I lived here, and I could afford it, I’d go twice a week.  (Book early, they fill up fast.)<//Review>

There is a reason they have five stars! Honest, good family, people, loving, calm horses that are well taken care of. Relaxed, very warm and welcoming. We took a Sunday evening, sunset ride, and met at the Cass Winery. Best experience ever. I will book again, and I will never waste my time looking elsewhere. Experienced rider or novice, they will treat you accordingly. Best horseback ride ever. Don’t waste your time, contact them now. My wife hasn’t ridden much, after our ride was over, she did not want to leave, neither did I.<//text>

<text>After looking for the perfect trail ride company, Central Coast Trailrides is who I decided on working with. I worked with Crystal and Molly for a special to propose to my now fiancé! They were both very accommodating and were available to answer my one too many questions lol The whole process was perfect. Molly was amazing, not only is she a guide but a wonderful photographer! She was our guide and made the whole experience one worth remembering - my fiancé didn't see it coming at all! Super thankful to have found Central Coast Trailrides!</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>They don’t offer beach rides. Not sure why they have photos online of them.

Placed an online booking and called with no answer or call back for days. They did reply to text quickly enough.

Will update once we have completed a tour! Still have high hopes based on the previous reviews.

UPDATE::::: down to 1 star (I had originally left 5 stars — not sure how that quantifies as a “bad review”) because the representative I was making my tour with took it upon themself to send me a text message about my review. Inappropriate. Bottom line. I understand the difficulties of updating photos, which is why I left 5 stars as to not impact the company rating. I did not expect to be texted upset paragraphs about it to my phone.

That is not okay. Bummer because I was excited to have a tour. Will never be using this unprofessional company again. Customer service is key and why I love supporting small businesses. But that was out of hand.<//review>< Pics>

Brian is a great host and leader. I am a nervous rider and was very comfortable on the trail. Randy was an extremely well behaved young horse. The setting is beautiful and Central Coast Trailrides is a very professional operation.<//text>

My daughter and I have been doing annual rides with CCT for the past few years. They are really wonderful people and they know a great deal about horses and riding. Their horses are all well-behaved and well taken care of. The trails have always been interesting and very scenic.  It's well worth your while to get out and take a ride while visiting the beautiful Central Coast.</Text>

Out of about 20-30 guided horseback rides that I've been on, this was one of my all-time favorites. Crystal was exceptionally helpful in deciding which trail to ride with my family of five, and Brian was a terrific guide on the trails. Within 15 minutes of arriving we'd played around with dogs, chatted with Brian and Crystal about their business, and were loaded up on horses, each of which was catered to our different riding abilities. The ride we chose was an hour long and the scenery was unreal, meandering through lush rolling hills and ancient oaks. Brian pointed out different things to check out along the way and made sure to take about 40 pictures of us, which he later uploaded to the cloud for us to download. If you're looking for a beautiful ride through wine country, don't hesitate to give them a call - you'll be glad you did!<//review>

<Text>My family and I had a great time! Wanted to make sure I was going to a place that treats the riders and the horses well, and this place exceeded my expectations! The trails are absolutely beautiful, and you can tell the horses are well trained and taken care of. Since I’ve been riding for years now the guide was very nice and let us trot and canter. Amazing place and I really recommend! (also the wine and gelato at the end is delicious)<//Text>< pictures>

<review>My husband and I were here for our 1 year anniversary. Central Coast Trail Rides accommodated our last minute decision for a sunset trail ride. It was amazing! Definitely the highlight of our visit. The horses were beautiful, clean and very tame. Our guide was so nice, he took beautiful pictures of us the entire ride and sent them to us.  My husband and I are both inexperienced riders but the guide made us feel safe the entire ride. The views were absolutely gorgeous! We would highly recommend Central Coast Trail rides when visiting Paso Robles, it’s an unforgettable experience you don’t want to miss!

My partner, who is not an experienced rider, was a little nervous but was put at great ease by owner Brian, and the calm, sweet horse he got to ride. The trial was lovely with a beautiful sunset and the ride is very relaxed. It was a late booking and Crystal and Brian were able to accommodate us easily. Overall, great value for money and a beautiful way to see the central coast . Highly recommended.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I can't say enough great things about my aunt and I's amazing experience with Brian. My aunt was very nervous but Brian made her feel  comfortable and gave her clear directions on how to ride her horse. It was her first time and she started off really scared but ended up loving it by the end. The horses were very calm and gentle but still lively and the ride was absolutely gorgeous.  We had an amazing time and will absolutely be back next time we visit the central coast!!</text>

The most fun we've had as a family in so so long! These guys were so great, we had a big group of young and old and they were just so patient and kind and easy to deal with. What a gorgeous ranch as well! I absolutely can't wait to come back and do some more riding there. I've encouraged anyone I can think of to come out and have some fun like we did, can't recommend them enough!< /text>

The scenery by Cass Winery was spectacular and filled with the amazing wildlife...hawks, jackrabbits and cottontails and of course, the friendly guide, Brian taking all our photos! I adored my horse, Cash and you could tell he was well loved. ❤️You simply must check them out for an unforgettable breath of fresh air.

I was able to take my fiance out on an amazing trail ride with Brian who showed us all over the 150 acre ranch. Brian was able to tailor the ride to our style and added some more challenging sectioning including some loping and trotting through the grounds. The horses are responsive and not just your typical trail horse. Crystal even was able to make it easy to change our ride time the day before. It was the easiest and best experience we have been able to have together and I know she and I will be coming back for more and trying the other rides. They are the best.<//Review>

<Review>I went on a group ride with Central Coast Trail Rides and they were great fitting me in on short notice.  They were very professional and knowledgeable about the area and provided all kinds of information during the ride. The guide always ensured everyone was doing ok during the ride. The horses appeared well trained, healthy and happy.  I would definitely recommend them for trail rides in the area.  I will definitely return when in the area again.<//Review>< pictures>

Crystal and Brian are wonderful hosts who do everything they can to ensure your time in the saddle is enjoyable and interesting. They take care to match riders' skills with horses' temperaments, and they're especially considerate and accommodating when it comes to beginners and young kids. Heartily recommended ... Enjoy your ride!</Review>

The scenery was magical, Crystal was easy to communicate with, and Brian was so friendly and patient with us. We were staying in Pismo Beach so it was a bit of a drive to get to the winery (about an hour), but it was so worth it. Would definitely recommend Central Coast Trailrides - a small family-run business.

Our family came up for the weekend and had a fantastic ride on Saturday. My daughter and I arrived a day late and she was so sad she missed it. Brian and Crystal were kind enough to accommodate a ride for just the two of us on Sunday.

Beautiful, well trained horses, amazing views, great trails and the best service around! If you're in the area make this a must stop!< /Review>

We had a wonderful time. We're a 4 hour drive from San Luis Obispo. This was our second trip down there. The first time we didn't ride but for now on that's the reason why we are gonna visit again hopefully in the near future. It was the highlight of our visit. The scenery was beautiful. The horses are beautiful, well trained and taken care of. Brian and Crystals love for horses was quite obvious. Brian was an awesome guide and mase it very enjoyable for everyone. My wife and I were in the back of the pack but Brian made it a point to drop back and talk to us several times so we didn't feel left out. I would recommend Central Coast Trailrides to anybody and everybody. If you are a first-timer these are the people to call.

We had an AMAZING and unforgettable experience horseback riding here. Our group consisted of 3 adults of varying riding abilities and two 5 year old girls. If you’re looking for a wonderful first riding experience for your kids, this is the place. Crystal and Brian are so personable,  genuine, and GREAT with kids. They know how to make them feel comfortable from the moment they get there. I was so impressed and will definitely be back.
We did a sunset ride that was absolutely lovely. Crystal arranged the saddles so both girls could go together on the same horse which was awesome because one was a little nervous about riding on her own. Brian ponied their horse and led our group. He was such a great guide and the kids felt so comfortable with him.
At the end of the ride, Brian let the girls meet some of the farm animals and gave us all otter pops. He even took our friends’ nearly 3-year old son for a brief ride on the horse so he didn’t feel left out.
These guys go ABOVE and BEYOND in every way to ensure everyone has a positive experience. And the complimentary pictures turned out beautiful! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</Text>

My family of four enjoyed a spectacular trail ride at HorseTail Ranch. Brian and Crystal were so kind and inviting when we arrived. They took the four of us on a lovely horse back ride over rolling hills with beautiful scenery. What impressed us most was how accommodating they were to our 6 year old daughter and 3 year old son. This was our kid’s first real trail ride and Brian and Crystal did everything they could to put them at ease. Overall, we had the best time and even spotted a bald eagle soaring overhead. At the end of our ride we got to visit with the many farm animals on the property and just take in the beauty of the whole place. Our visit was rather spontaneous but we are so happy we went and hope we can visit again the future. Side note: there are two rental homes on the property. How much fun that would be!<//review>

My husband and I scheduled a last minute horseback riding tour with them on our way home from Monterrey. Crystal, our tour guide, was flexible with scheduling us and we ended up getting our own private tour. Although we were first time riders, Crystal (and her horses!) made us feel comfortable and knowledgeable in horseback riding . Thank you for this fun experience :)< /Text>

We found central coast trail rides when we came to SLO for a bachelorette party. IT WAS SO MUCH FUN!!! Brian and Crystal are wonderful and make you feel welcome the second you arrive. They were able to accommodate all 12 of us on short notice and it was the highlight of our trip. Go out and ride with them... the horses and ranch are beautiful. You will not be disappointed!</Text>

<text>Beautiful ride along the hillsides at sunset. The views were spectacular but the hospitality was even better. Brian and Crystal treated us like personal friends. The cabin and house rental they have on site were so beautiful, I wish I had booked our stay there instead. I guess, we're just gonna hafta come back!<//text><response>None< /response><Rating>5</Rating><user_name>Liz V</user_name>< Time>

This was the highlight of our trip to California! Brian was a excellent guide. He was totally professional and he was a pleasure to ride with. This is a 5 star experience. My wife and I booked a private 2 hour ride and got the experience of a lifetime. Were from Toronto Canada and the views and surrounding scenery in Creston are epic.

My horse Randy was amazing as well. As a fairly new rider it was a very easy ride. We were able to snap a few great pictures thanks to Brian who knew exactly where to take the best shots along the trail.

Honestly this was the best thing we did in a 2 week trip to LA Paso SF and Napa. Thanks to Central Coastal Trail Rides for the great vacation memories. These guys are a great company and we felt safe and very well taken care of. If we are in the area again on vacation we will 100% be booking with Central Coast Trail rides again.  I cant say enough good things about them. Cheers

<Review>An incredible experience!!!! As a friend and I were looking up things to explore in Paso while on vacation we found Central Coast Trailrides online and sent them an email and to our surprise we received a call a few minutes later.  We were totally excited to hear from Crystal so soon, she was able to book us an hour and a half ride for the next day. It was last minute and they were very helpful in getting us book and she was so nice. We rode thru Cass Vineyard and a near by area which was just so breathtaking. Brian was an amazing guide, he was very knowledgeable about the area and by his enthusiasm one could tell he loves what he does. His passion for people and his horses shows, he kept conversation going to get to know us and throughout the ride he took lots of great pictures for us and sent them to us right after the ride. I had only been riding a handful of times but I felt very comfortable on my horse, Brian took effort to make sure we were comfortable and checked our equipment multiple times to ensure we were good. We were even able to lope a few times!!  It was the most amazing feeling, this was definitely a highlight to our girls trip and an experience I’ll never forget and bonus it came with a tasting at Cass winery. I would definitely recommend horseback riding  with Central Coast Trailrides and would definitely book again.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Highly recommend Central Coast Trailrides! We were in Cambria on a family vacation and looking for horseback riding close by. Crystal was great to work with in getting everything scheduled and we had a fantastic time on our ride with Brian at the Creston ranch. All of the horses were well cared for and great to ride. Our 12 year old son and 72 year old mother in law both loved it! Brian was a great guide and even took pictures of all of us along the way with all of the beautiful scenery. We would definitely ride with them again!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Name>Christine Metzler</Name><review>Brian & Crystal are are wonderful!! So professional, caring & accommodating. We met at Cass Winery in Paso Robles for horseback riding thru the vineyards. Brian had perfect horses for my daughter & I. I’m a complete novice & was VERY nervous & He was patient, helpful & made great conversation. Took some wonderful pics of my daughter & I too! Our excursion even came with wine tasting for 2 at the winery! I can’t recommend this company for small or large horseback riding excursions. They are VERY reasonable too. Horses well taken care of. Can’t wait to go back!!<//review></record></dataset><record>

Central Coast Trail Rides (CCTR) is a must do if your spending time around the Paso Robles area. It offers a great way to see this beautiful area and is suitable for all ages and abilities. I would recommend CCTR to anyone thinking of doing some fun or different activities in Wine Country.<//review>< Pics>

<text>Me and my boyfriend love to ride in our home country, so on our holliday we wanted to experience the us from a horseback. We got a warm welcome by a happy dog and cat. And had a lovely ride with Brian on two sweet, sensitive and responsive horses. A relaxed ride around the ranch with beautifull views and a good canter to wrap it up. It is hartwarming to see how Brian and Crystal take such good care of all their animals.</text><user_name>Dian van erp</user_name></record></dataset><record>

Central Coast Trail Riders is the best! Such a beautiful ride- it’s like going back in time. The horses, the property, the trails, the  owners and their staff are all five-star wonderul!. You will find yourself at ease in the saddle and off to take in spacious views from the top of the hills along peaceful trials and a lake. A friendly red coon hound trots along side your posse’ -giving everyone a fantastic sense of being on trial when Cailfornia was still part of the American Frontier. The welcoming barn area where you park, sign in and meet your horse is charming bright and clean. The owners and their sweet family offer a warm welcome, clear and friendly instruction, and email you pictures taken on the ride.
I’d love to keep this place a secret but it deserves to be shared, especially if you are a local. Oh! There are also two beautifully appointed cabins on this property that are available through Air Bnb! How’s about that for a darn near perfect Central Coast Getaway
or Staycation?< /review>

<text>They don't take appointments,  first come basis only, but these guys are fast and efficient so even if 2 or 3 people are ahead of you, it's still quick service. And they are honest. I had my motor home smog tested by them and they reduced the price  from their posted price for motorhomes because the testing was easier than usual. What a pleasant surprise! They also repaired 2 broken tailpipe hanger straps at very reasonable cost.< /text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

This is a family owned, local business.  They are excellent at
what they do, which is mainly smog testing.  It is a first-come, first served place.  Their price is the best and there's never a long line.  The most I've waited was 45 minutes.  I've been going to them for years.  I highly recommend them.<//review>

<Review>Dropped off my car to have a muffler installed at 9am. Called at 11:30 to check on progress. I learned they didn't know about it. Jeff assured me he'd be done by 2pm. He called me at 1:20pm to tell me it was finished. Jeff is a good guy. Muffler sounds great! Really cheap price for the installation, only 60 bucks to cut off the old one and slap on the new 2.5 inch axle back exhaust. They even got rid of the old one for free.<//Review>< pics>

Horrible place to go if your car is a hard car to pass smog, every time i've tried this place the owner is yelling at me about how my car wont pass smog and he is extremely unprofessional, doesn't help and inform me what needs to be fixed or what sensors need to be replaced, just kicks me out the door and the same thing has happened to family and friends, I will never try holiday smog again and I wouldn't recommend this shop to anyone.<//Review>

<Review>Great and fast service only downside is when i first brought my car in for smog they had said i purposefully disabled the engine light but after i told them i hadn't that the battery was dead and the car had been sitting for about 4 months they just said ok and said I'll need to bring it back after it's been driven for a time and have it smog again what nice is a resmog had only  cosy me 10$.< /Review>< pics>

<text>I just called, and politely inquired about installation or fabrication of an x-pipe for dual exhaust. I've been going to Holiday muffler exclusively my entire life. The person who answered the phone couldn't understand what I was asking for. Then told me they weren't interested and hung up on me. I will never use the shop again. Not a good place to go.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Been my go-to smog place for awhile.   They won't mess with modded vehicles, and sometimes are a bit gruff, but usually midweek mornings you're in and out in 20 mins...</Review>

<user>102535720330499985514<//user><Text>I took a motor home here to have a smog check.
They said they would not smog it because it had a banks system. I pointed out it the motor home had the correct  sticker on it with the exception number. The system has been on the motor home for over seven years with never a smog problem.  The rude smog tech and Mark the manager would not budge saying the air resources board frowns on these things. This is completely wrong that is why they go thru a testing processing and why they issue stickers.  When I Called him out on the carpet about him being wrong. He then gave me a song and dance about the air resources board running spot checks or under cover cars thru there. I think if the smog tech and the owner who is mentioned many times on here did the job with a little customer service and applied the smog checks they way the Air resources board asks them to they might not have to worry about the Air resources board checking them. I took it rite down the street and it passed as it always does with flying colors. Bad customer service by the people behind the counter and bad customer service by the smog tech..</Text></record>

Awsome and professional service from all involved,
worked around several problems I had that were not anticipated.
It was a very busy lot, its funny that someone gave a weak review. I never had a problem.<//review>

Their prices are insanely low and the food is great. Where on this planet can you get a burger, fries AND drink for $6.95? It all tasted very good and customer service is fabulous. Best in Redding for reasonable good food.</Review>

<Review>It's like finding a secret portal to a place and time that you just can't find anymore. Very friendly, remembered my order from a single visit 3 weeks ago. A nice cozy diner that is hidden in an industrial area, delicious home cooked food and amazing atmosphere, like going to your family and friends house for breakfast.< /Review>< pictures>

My husband and I were WELCOME   by Jose and his wife . Found service to be  awesome with  that  homemaid taste and feeling.  Definently a awesome place. We shall return soon for those daily specials Jose's famous for. The atmosphere was quite with music in background.  I ordered  quavo ranchero with home fries. Rick ordered 2 eggs over easy ham potatoes an toast.  Both had coffee and reasonable prices our bill was 16.78$. Loved our meals.<//review>

Great store -- recently moved across town and have been looking for a dispensary that I enjoy as much as Herbarium. Good prices, great staff who is willing to talk you through things over the phone, cool vibes, cool products. Thank you for not shaming me as I asked every dumb question under the sun!

Only issues are that I once had a delivery order accepted and they canceled due to the distance late in the evening, which was kind of annoying, and their parking lot was designed by Satan himself, but overall, I adore this place.<//Text>

I had an amazing visit at Herbarium. They took their time in thoroughly answering any questions I had and explaining everything. I worked with E-Money and his vibrant personality made it so easy to enjoy my experience. Amazing prices and deals, you can’t do any better than Herbarium! Thank you!</text>

And the beautiful girl with curly hair who was working was also incredibly helpful and sweet. Great product. Thanks guys!< /Review></record>

Today I met Frances and she explained in detail why certain strands have the outcome that they do and how one's personal diet could actually affect the high.  MIND BLOWN!! A true specialist.  I certainly hope she'll be in the next time I go back.  Absolutely love coming to this store.  Enthusiastic staff, killer playlist and super chill vibes. Definitely check them out!<//Review>

We stopped by this location being that we were in LA for a few days. This review is based on the employee named STAR that helped us ! She made my experience at this location perfect ! STAR was very knowledgeable of all of the products and she knew her stuff ! She’s is very friendly and outgoing ! I hope that she will be promoted to a manager/supervisor soon because she is a great salesperson. I digress ;Herbarium‘s atmosphere and products Rock!!!!< /text>

Probably one of the more wholesome and diversified dispensaries in Hollywood.
Fast friendly and inviting service.
Aileen was a delight. Would love to have a coffee with her!

I just don't know why they won't hire me... but I'll still visit,  just to see Aileen again. Come on...< /Text>

Very cool place and set up. Music was loud and hard to talk/hear, especially with masks on. As a first time customer here; usually shops explain their deals without having to ask or ask the exact details of them. Also, looked like you could only buy grams of their own flower and not of other growers but maybe that was explained incorrectly. Otherwise, had good looking product; very modern/hip vibe. Great deal for first time buyers. But could turn the music down a tad, although good music, can’t hurt to be able to have a conversation without lots of “what’s”. oh yeah,  if a customer asks about a few different strains and the only response you get is “it’s good!”.😂 An “it wasn’t my favorite” would have been more helpful than 5 “it’s real good”</review>

Come during the evening-night it’s honestly a great vibe, they had a food stand outside and parking. The people are super chill and have great knowledge on their items. They have quite a few options and said they grow their own leaf 🍃 🤌🏼 Will definitely be coming back

EDIT: As you can see, the business responded to rectify my situation and gave me an email to reach out to. I did exactly that three days ago and got zero response. So at this point I’m just going to assume that customer service is at the bottom of the priorities list.

Sold my fiancée and I gummies that were 20:1 CBD:THC—meaning that there is 10x more CBD than THC and will have no effect. We were not informed, were and considering we were carded TWICE it should’ve been taken into consideration that we are from Texas as tourists, where we obviously don’t even have dispensaries. We don’t know to look out for these things. Called this facility and little was done to rectify the situation because the package was opened.

Offering a “good deal” for an exchange when we already spent our money simply is not good enough. It’ll actually be cheaper for us to pay full price down the street rather than commute to this location for whatever deal was being offered. Whether this policy is company or law based does not matter, train your employees better. Do better. This could’ve been completely avoided if we would’ve been educated or AT LEAST asked exactly what kind of effects we were looking for.<//Text>

<review>If I could rate this 0 stars I would.

Today I went to Herbarium on December 5, 2020 this is the second time I've seen the  customer service that wasn't up to par. For example: asking questions about product and the associate looks num ! I understand it's a dispensary marijuana business, but I'm spending money in  retail environment. A lot attitude, I ask questions just to see what's new and better. I believe you should have a meeting on who wants to work there and Create and inviting energy to drive business<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>Very VERY clean. Great selection. AMAZING costumer service! First off the ladies are so awesome. Very beautiful. I mean that in the most respectful way. There was nothing but smiles in there and I felt like I was at a friend's house that I've known for several years. Highly recommend! Oh. And i apologize if I get your name wrong. Katie? I believe. She was wearing a pink sweater. Couldn't be a day over 25. Helped me pick out the best selection. Please correct me if I'm wrong. #HERBARIUM 💯🙏🏼<//text>< userid>

Very nice dispensary with a wide variety of items in stock. I live around the area so they do offer free and fast delivery services as well, but prefer to come in person. Aileen helped out with a recent purchase and quickly helped me out. Definitely my go to dispensary in the Los Angeles area!< /Review>

<Text>I came into this shop last night for the first time since I moved out here and Aileen(I think it was spelled) was able to get me a nice deal on a quarter of some wedding cake. I was also amazed at how well-orchestrated the Christmas decorations were, they really gave me a Christmas themed vibe. Overall I recommend this shop, and I will continue to purchase from there. Excellent service and workers.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

had a terrible experience at this dispensary; the staff are unkind, uncaring human beings.

Professional, easy to deal with, not much different from pharmacy delivery. Ordered delivery for a family member going through chemo. She is high risk for COVID19 and I didn’t want her to go out to the store. Ordered at night and delivered by a very professional person next morning. Constant text communication until delivery. Didn’t feel sketchy at all. I feel relieved that such service is available in Los Angeles. I like their website because they explain their product really well. She wants relief  from aches and nausea and help her to sleep, not be so high, so I was able to pick and choose ones that made sense for her.

Weed so dry it thanos'd: so I bought two ounces the other day and I've been meaning to post this, the weed is so dry it turns to dust, I guess they think people like the dry stuff.  And trust me folks the weed here isnt cheap ._. Other than that the dude who tend me was pretty chill and knowledgeable.
Update: I'm a medical patient not a recreational user.... I used to shop here for my ounces when it first opened up, but 1 out of 2 ounces will always be dry, I gave it another chance because i got a good deal last time when you guys had a promotion going on when the reward system was up, if I can explain better one ounce was green and I think it was gorrilla glue and the other one was a hybrid in a grayish white bag, dont get me wrong the weed is good it's just too dry. I'm just here sharing my experience, if you guys have a refund policy or an exchange policy that'll be great because I dont like spending 500+ for dusty weed. I'm sure some people who buy ounces can relate to my post.< /text>

Do NOT come here if you have medical. You’ll never get the right taxes and when it’s clear you’ve been overcharged they will try to convince you that despite what it says in the receipt that you received a “discount” (or the correct tax bracket). Don’t expect to receive an apology or the right price. Weed isn’t any better than you would get anywhere else. I recommend going to zen for better prices with the same selection<//Text>

Compared to all the other delivery services in California, I’ve had the best experience with herb. Everyone here is nice, the prices are good, and I’ve actually gotten some of the best bud I’ve had since moving out here from herb. Definitely gonna use them again and I’d recommend it to my buddies< /review>

Antonela with the cute purple hair was SO amazing and cute and helpful. I usually have a bad experience with bud tenders in LA as they all tend to be very stuck. P.S. I lost my card there and she called my 3 mins later to come get it back.<//Review>

Would give zero stars if I could... I went to this place after a fun night at Hollywood blvd, got some chik fil a and then headed to herbarium. We chose this place cause of the reviews but regret it. The bud was fire 🔥 but they sold us a defective cart. We called and left a voicemail but no one returned my call. This was a week ago. So weak customer service.

We went back and they said they couldn't swap out my cart cause ten days had passed but didn't even answer their phone when we originally called or called us back. By the time we could drive back they said no returns after ten days. So I'll leave the one star review and won't return. Thanks for nothing herbarium!!! Sticking to other dispensaries from now on.< /review>

<Review>First time at this dispensary and the moment I walked through the door I was immediately greeted by Heather who was “outstanding”. I don’t use that word often, because many of my experiences at dispensaries are quite mediocre. Not this time.

Heather was very knowledgeable, knew exactly what I was looking for, and she made an awesome recommendation on some hash extract that completely blew me away. Thanks again Heather!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<user_name>GREY DILLMAN</user_name><Date>1598563779605</Date><rating>5</rating><text>I wanted to try everything suggested before writing a review as I was unsure about the "$5 off" deal and I have to say I am impressed. I have frequented a nearby competitor but the quality of product and level of expertise the staff at Herbarium displayed has made this my new go-to.
I was helped by the young lady with green hair and tattoos and I have to say every single product she suggested blew me away. She was very welcoming and friendly, able to answer a lot of questions and kept a smile on my face!
Will be coming back for any and all needs!

So I had a miscommunication with the kind and super informative general manager Samantha and I have to say that the situation was handled with professionalism along with excellent customer service. Weed is fire too. I am for sure going to be a long term customer. Thanks ladies for  your assistance. 🙏😊✌️<//text>

Quality products! Friendly Staff! And the best products in Los Angeles!! They have everything!! From Infused pre-rolls and infused weed to Pens, Flowers and Concentrates!! What i really like about walking in here is the great atmosphere at the dispensary. The staff is always so cool and they don't mind you walking around and checking stuff out. Much friendlier experience then other Los Angeles dispensaries that i have been to..<//Text>

This place was incredible, last night was really special after waiting a month for this experience, and it truly is one amazing experience.Made the reservation online and upon arrival you need to present it to the first round of security, with ID, so they can check you out for coming for dinner.<//Text>

<review>Antonela was such an amazing help to me. I came in confused as I was looking for products that could help manage my Grandmothers chronic pain and not only was I treated with so much patience, she truly took the time to take me through all the different products and brands that Herbarium had to offer.

< Review>
Wanted to give this place a chance.  The gal who helped me seemed very frazzled, I told her it was my first time there (which didn’t seem to matter to her).  I asked for recommendations, she didn’t ask me what I was looking for, just seemed to blindly pick a couple of different strains.  Then after I paid, she quickly scampered away leaving me at the cash register feeing very blah about my purchase.  Dope layout in the store & security guard was very nice.  Most likely won’t go back as there are friendlier options in Hollywood area.</Review>

<Text>DUDE ! This place is the coolest in LA to get incredible weed. We met Megan, who helped us SO MUCH, it was so clear, they all are so nice and kind. They know their product and their advice are spot on. To sum it up:  it's heaven on earth.

I can’t believe I’m charged $5.00 to pay for my package if I used that card reader & $3.00 if I use the ATM WHICH is expected...But that $5.00 machine will cost your business customers....It is outrageous...So if I continue to shop there that means I’ll have to have cash and seldom carry cash...That’s a horrible policy and you feel cheated ...😈< /review>

Young girl was very much not helpful and bad vibes.
I ask her a simple question about the strongest pre roll with the highest thc, what I viewed online. She did not give clear answer, whatever.
Cool place just don’t ask questions about what they offer online.<//Text>

So disappointed. They charged me extra money. When they arrived.
And also each jar had one of these moisture packs inside. Which adds weight and also destroys the quality of the buds. For $205  for 3 eighth's I'd expect it to be as advertised<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Couldn't say more about the staff and Dispensary.. If you have any questions about whats brands are best, or sell most. They are super easy to talk to.. I don't smoke much but, when i do. I want the best brands and best products. When I walk into the dispensary, i want the budtender to ell me what the best OG Kush strain they have is, when i ask. These bud Tenders are happy to do so.. And even let you know about other cool products like their MoonRocks.. Picked up a gram of these MoonRocks because i told them i like hash. Never had anything better in my life. If you have rough sleep like i do!! Then try the Caviar Gold MoonRocks..

I’m from AZ and was super excited to come here and ask questions. The place looks super cool and fun. The bud tender Alexandria wasn’t very informative or willing to talk to me about specials though, and I just felt like I was lost. Wish I could say I want to come back. Thanks!< /Review>

<Review>Herbarium has been my shop since day one they opened up, the staff has been there for me on my best days and have gone the extra mile for me on my worst days. They have a great selection of products and some of the best weed Ive ever smoked since moving to LA. They have great events and make holidays extra special, sometimes I'll go there just to visit and get a pre roll because I always find myself leaving happier. Thank you for always being there for me, there's no other shop in the area with this vibe or heart.< /Review>< Pics>

The space is beautiful, tinted glass creates a momentarily other worldly glow. Run entirely by females, Herbarium feels welcoming and looks like a teenage girls room. Regrettably the product is embarrassing(see photo of a bud of Punch Breath). And Herbarium VASTLY overcharges its customers. The eighth I paid 35.00 for costs Herbarium 2.00 per gram. How do they get away with it? Mine was an 'emergency' purchase. I shall never consider returning. Oh, lest I forget. My hearing has just returned.< /text>

<text>Please be careful of this place. They offer stamp cards so you can get a discount after a certain number of purchases but they will deny that request once you reach that number - this place is a SCAM! DO NOT GO - WORST DISPENSARY IN THE WHOLE OF THE UNITED STATES.<//text>< pictures>

<review>Flower was amazingly good!  Received terrible customer service from Agustina wouldn’t let me purchase this rad berry container had to tell her multiple times this is what I wanted to purchase, she was persistent for me to purchase what she wanted to recommend. I am the customer with the money. I decide  what I want to buy 😡 Would gladly return if employee gets removed from establishment! Thank you<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

The location was cool and the Cavi Cones are something else, however, walking inside was a bit awkward. Me and my girlfriend get inside and we clearly and loudly say hello and ask how they are.. only to be met with silence.. so much for customer service right? Only to cap it off with a medtender that was passive aggressive about explaining her own product. Caviar Gold product is great! Your staff sucks!< /review>

<Text>This is my go-to spot! I’m lucky, because it’s conveniently located to where I live. The staff  is super friendly and knowledgeable. As far as products go, you can pretty much get anything. I recently was introduced to the WYLD brand CBD/THC infused gummies and my life has never been the same. I highly recommend coming here. You’ll learn a lot about the products and have a variety of options to pick from.<//Text>< Pics>

Great customer service, chillest vibes. Omar was knowledgeable, accomodating, and personable. I’ll be very excited to see where this place goes in the future. Good stop for recreational users as tourists and locals alike. Limited parking, but an easy spot to get to.< /review>

The farmacist, Omar, was a doll, he was really knowledgeable about their products and helped me make the best choice for my needs.  The medicine he recommended did exactly what he said it would do.  I couldn't be more pleased and I will def be back!

This was my favourite dispensary in LA for a long time but I will no longer go because of the way customers are treated. Specifically, although I had been going to this place for over a year and been a loyal customer to this store, about two weeks ago when I went, employee, Omar, discriminated against me by accusing me of dishonesty, when this clearly was not the case. I complained to management and I believe Omar is still there and I do not want to go to a place where such a non-inclusive person works. Watch out for Omar if you go, he may kick you out of the store, just to please his own agenda!

Shoutouts to everyone else at the store though, you all work really hard but the environment is not the same with the way OMAR treats clients.< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>A great, 5 star experience at the "new kid on the block", Herbarium on La Brea.  The quality of the product is top notch and the prices are very reasonable.  That could be said about several dispensaries, but what sets Herbarium apart are the people and the vibe.  They are obviously trying to create a  friendly, welcoming, family atmosphere . . . and are succeeding.  Everyone greets you warmly, all questions are answered in detail and without a hint of impatience, they work to satisfy the customer's needs.  The place is light, open, airy, clean, safe, pleasant.  This is what purchasing cannabis products ought to look like post January 2018.  Best of all, Omar will gladly discuss with you the nuances in the works of Stanley Kubrick or other significant filmmakers!  Now that's a Hollywood dispensary!</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

This is the theeee spot. First off the have alot of parking in front and you can miss it, the whole fromt of the store is covered in this colorful glass that is so welcoming. Then once you walk in you are greeted by the nicest people of any dispensary I’ve ever been too. Big open store the layout is perfect and they have the cutest dog named Boo. The products here are fire and the staff knows everything about them, you can tell they use those products themselves. The dry bud here is also fire, perfectly cured and they have a wide enough selection to suite anyones needs. I’d say this is the best spot in all of LA, if not all of California!! Do yourself a favor and check this place out, you’ll definitely be coming back!! They also offer a loyalty rewards program which is unbeatable, FREE STUFF!!<//review>

Today was my first experience here and I was blown away at the kindness, compassion and knowledge of the people who work here.

Abi helped me and she couldn't have been more compassionate or kind. She went out of her way to help me and on top of that she was adorable with my fur baby, London. Actually,  everyone came over to meet London and animal lovers are my kind of people.

I came here from Pasadena and I hate LA traffic but they are SO worth it!!!

So do I recommend this place, that is a big YES!</text>

I used to love coming here but after hearing about the blatant discrimination that came from Omar to my friends, I am appalled. He accused them of being a thief to the point of one crying. Who treats customers like this? Shame on you Omar.</Review>

Apparently this place is a scam and they make fake deals and then don't stick to them once you make the purchase. DO NOT GO, total tourist trap and a completely corrupt system<//Text>

Herbarium is a dope up and coming spot. The shop is packed with a bunch of product. From CBD water to bath bombs, there are so many THC/CBD edibles/products to choose from. Of course there are DANK, beautiful crystal sparkly flowers. The service is quick, music is good and the shop is clean. Sidenote ~ a bunch of babes run the shop and make an aesthetic as yummy as the edibles.</Text>

This was my second time going to this place within two weeks.

The first day I walked in they were using a new POS system. I walked in and two customers walked in after me. I looked at the guy behind the counter and made eye contact so he’d come over and see me waiting and offer to help. He said “oh I don’t work here.” The two customers that came in after me were both helped and walked out the door before I was even sent to the register because I was waiting for them. After that, I expressed my worry to the manager and she swiftly sent the same guy over to me to help me that said “I don’t work here” and he quickly apologized and sent me out the door with my products after paying a $42 debit minimum fee. The first time patient deal  as nice as I got a free vape pen but no cartridge.

Returning to this place a second time the following week during a lunch break to see all new staff except the security guard. I am at work within walking distance to this place. I forgot my pen at home and was going to buy a disposable cartridge, which they don’t sell. No big deal. Then I say ok, let’s buy a pen because I’m an hour away from home and I’ll buy a cartridge. “We don’t sell pens” “only the cartridges.” And she said “So do you want any flower?” And I said “Not sure, you have a $42 minimum debit fee” and she said “We’re cash only.” So the week before they did debit now they’re cash only. All leading to an unfortunate two visits to this dispensary, with only one of those visits leaving with medication.

So you sell half the item but not the full item to be used, yet you give the other half away for free? This is the second time I’ve left unhappy and the girl at thE counter waved me off behind my back as I left, I could see it in the giant glass reflections.

Overall the manager could be the owner not sure, but the lady with a tattoo and long reddish blonde hair seems to really care about the customers but when she’s not there it didn’t seem to be as loving and as caring as her towards the customers. But the security guard lady was very friendly both visits. Long time patient here. I wish my visits were more fortunate.

Thanks</Text>

<Review>This place was awesome! Everyone was friendly/helpful/suggestive. Tina did a great job of getting us the strain that fit our criteria and it was a smooth experience. Upon leaving I realized we were rang up incorrectly and went back in but they immediately corrected it and sent us with extra goodies! Love the atmosphere too, super cool
10/10. *it was the colorful blowup see-through furniture out front for me😜*<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Hands down, one of the best dispensaries in LA. Everything is super fresh, they always have new stuff in every time I’m in there. Shout out to Eain (or E-Money, aha!) He always has great product suggestions, info and great convo/personality. The staff are really nice and hella knowledgeable. AND delivery/pick-up is fast af.< /Text>

{'time': 1606794522302, 'text': "Mayank, thank you for taking the time out to leave us this review, it's just a bit confusing. Maybe your way of comparing us to a 99 cent store was off, because we do sell luxury items at the cheapest prices not the other way around. If you ever felt at any time our prices are too high, we would have been happy for you to give Calma ( or any other dispensary ) a call to ask them what they sell that item for so we could of priced match. We are known for having the lowest prices in LA, and if for some reason we don't, we will price match."}<//resp>
