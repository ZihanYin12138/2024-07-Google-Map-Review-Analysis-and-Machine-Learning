<text>I am not a review writer very often, but I am compelled to tell about the excellent service I received at Bob’s Auto Service.
Not only was the service very fair and thorough, but it was done quickly.
The personal service was so helpful. I got frequent updates and felt like a very valuable customer.
It is so comforting to find car repair that is a part of the neighborhood. I am now a loyal customer.</text><userid>115179248966195196865< /userid><Rating>5< /Rating><Gmap_id>0x808580f03941d71f:0xf01eaeef693b5695<//Gmap_id><Date>1627366472946</Date>< Response>

Jonathan and his father are top notch. I can't recommend them enough. If you need anything at all please give them a call or stop by and I assure you they will exceed your expectations. Fair prices and high quality service. They will go out of their way to take care of you. For example, my battery was completely dead and they drove to my garage to give me a jump, the battery was completely dead so they went back and got the new battery and came back to replace, then we drove to the garage and they cleaned everything up. All of this was at 10pm after hours! INCREDIBLE. I would give them 10-stars if I could because that was just one example of the multiple times they have helped me in the past few months. Thanks again!</Text>

Super friendly and GREAT service. I was in a bit of a last minute bind to get my tire fixed and they were quick to help, super nice even though it was close to closing time, and fixed the issue. Working great. I will def be back. Next time for my oil change. Hopefully no issues with car between now and then but if there is good to know I have a shop not from from the house.< /Review>

The boss is super nice. He helped me with tire pressure check right after I came in. I was kind of worried at that moment since my tire pressure sensor turned on just before my driving through highway 1. And I really appreciate their kind and prompt service.</Text>

These guys were great, I brought my car in for a water pump, ac charge and oil change and was recommended drive belt, and transmission fluid change. It was $890 which I thought was reasonable for all of that, and compared to other shops in the city I've been to.
They were really friendly and kept me updated throughout the day, which made it an easy experience.
I have an older car (2007) and I definitely have to bring it in more than I'd like to, I'm bringing it here from new on!< /text>

Jason, the mechanic who helped me, was extremely professional and helpful even though, as I could tell, he was very busy. I brought my car in an hour before they closed on Saturday and was able to get my tires replaced by Monday early afternoon (they were closed on Sunday).  I'm impressed and very pleased about the promptness of their service.</text>

<Text>I came to this auto shop to have some new headlights installed on my car. The mechanic, Jason, was super helpful. He gave me a reasonable price for the work that needed to be done. He saw how dirty the exterior of my car was and gave me a free wash with it! Not only that, Jason stayed after hours to help me with all this. Very nice guy.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPODH8mRXDU5QcVMVFzSa8Z6TSQUbiPaWoOe4Ci=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1604446079629, 'text': 'Thank You Tom!\n\n#MCNUGGT POWER 💯'}< /Response>< GmapID>

I ran over a nail in the late afternoon, and I had to get my tire patched otherwise I couldn't drive home. Even though it was almost closing time and it was a last minute request, Bob's auto service still told me to bring my car in. I actually got my tire patched after their official closing time! They gave me a reasonable price, the mechanic and receptionist were extremely friendly, and they got the job done in no time at all. Highly recommend this shop!<//Text>

Brought my car down to Bobs. Professional and friendly. Great communication and fair pricing. They found and fixed the repairs needed to clear smog check, smogged it after repairs were done and as requested changed my oil as well. They then gave me some notice of some things that still need attending. Great service! Will return again!< /Text>

<text>I went in to get my oil changed and was so impressed by the service, communication, and helpful staff! I never once felt pressured to get something fixed that I didn’t want. They changed my oil and replaced my front tires which were super worn down for an incredibly fair price. I would absolutely recommend this place for anyone looking for a trustworthy and reliable mechanic at a fair price!<//text><Response>None<//Response>< name>

<Review>Great car repair shop. I left my car at 5pm on Tuesday and it was ready the very next day at 4. The son of the mechanic who manages customer car is really cool, updating you all the time of the status through text messages. Based on my previous experiences with mechanics in SF, this shops also seems to be really affordable.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>The starter on my car died today and by some miracle it started up one more time so I was able to drive it to Bob's. The dad and son duo were amazing to work with, diagnosing the problem almost immediately once my car died again in their parking lot. The dad was able to get it fixed along with replacing my front brakes, which he saw were down to 20%, all in 2 hrs! Earlier than the original estimated pickup of 3.5 which still would've been incredible considering it was a Sat afternoon. Great communication via text too with his son. While not thrilled this happened to begin with, super grateful I was able to get my car back in a super timely manner and in working order. Very reasonable prices too! Would gladly go back for future maintenance or repairs.<//Review><name>Debbie Yee</name><date>1610856129142<//date>< userid>

<Review>This is thus far the best auto body shop to me in SF. Service is great and excellent! And most importantly, the price is very affordable comparing to other body shops. I did an oil change today, they even offered me a discount, the best price ever! I will definitely be returning for their service again . Highly recommend it!</Review>< gmapID>

I was able to bring in my car and it was fixed and ready for pick up later in the same day. They were very communicative, efficient, and friendly. The pricing was very reasonable and they explained all the work that was needed thoroughly. I will definitely bring my car in for any of my future needs!<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Honestly one of the best shops in San Francisco. Brought multiple cars in and left with them basically brand new without any of the extra charges. They give you fair pricing, let you know what’s the problem ASAP, keeps you informed throughout the process, and they’re fast. They’re usually packed so I’d definitely recommend calling in to schedule a appointment! Highly recommend!<//text>< Pics>

{'time': 1617650424596, 'text': "Good Morning Judy!\n\nHope all is well! Happy Monday as well ~\n\nThank you for your feedback! Allow me to explain. If I recall correctly, you came in around 5pm with your vehicle and you told us that your car was making a strange noise. I told my mechanic to stop what he was doing to help you out. We checked out your vehicle and found that the front driver side wheel was missing a brake screw. You then crawled under the vehicle to see what screw was missing. Upon checking, we both acknowledged that there was a problem near the brake.\n\nWith regards to the $100 charge, I sincerely apologize that you misunderstood me. It was my fault as well because I just had the COVID Vaccine and felt very tired and drowsy. Allow me to kindly explain. My mechanic offered to check out all 4 of your wheels just to be sure that you are safe. Because we saw that you were missing a screw on one side, we offered to check out all of your tires just to be sure you are safe to drive which is roughly $25 per wheel with the screw included. We would have to put your vehicle on the lift, take out each of your tires to do a thorough safety inspection. You kindly denied and left.\n\nEvery time when a customer comes in, I will always make sure that their vehicle is currently safe to drive and exit our lot. Safety is our priority and we will always uphold that standard.\n\nAnd finally, I applaud you for working on your own vehicle. Not many people can do that! That is why consumers reach out to a mechanic. When a customer comes in, I treat each and every one of their vehicles like it's ours. We uphold to the highest standards and will always do our best to ensure you they are satisfied. I myself am a Christian and I uphold myself to never lie, sin and always be as honest as possible. I hope that my explanation is clear and transparent.\n\nOnce again, thank you for coming in and allowing us to inspect your vehicle. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out! Have a fantastic, safe and blessed day! :)\n\nWarmest Regards,\nBob's Auto Service"}< /Resp>

Great experience with Bob's to get the brakes replaced on my Toyota Yaris. Messaged the owner through here and got a quick response. Walked me through the needed service via text after I dropped off my car and got same-day service. The staff there was nice, friendly, and courteous.< /Text>

<Text>I love Bob’s! They are quick, friendly and do a great job. I also love the location in North Beach right on Columbus, so there’s tons of great coffee shops restaurants and stores to check out while you wait. Also a quick walk to fishermans wharf and the water. Thanks for being my go-to spot for tune ups and oil changes!</Text>< pics>

<Review>Bob's is great. I've gotten an oil change/service and had to have my hybrid battery replaced. Regular service is super affordable. Hybrid batteries, on the other hand, are expensive AF which is an unfortunate surprise, especially when your IMA light comes on a mere 6 months after your 10 year warranty expires. But Bob and his son Jonathan are super helpful and kind. Even though paying 3k for my car was not the birthday present to myself I had in mind, I'm grateful to have a local neighborhood mechanic I feel I can trust. They also replaced my broken driver-side visor free of charge which was a lovely gesture even if the cost of batteries still stings.<//Review>< Pictures>

BOB IS A THIEF. These other reviews must be fake. Bob claimed to have fixed a part of my car. He then showed me a website claiming that it took 20 hours. He then charged me for 20 hours of labor. I found out later that it only takes three hours to fix the part. After all of that, my car still was not fixed. I ended going to an honest mechanic- Chow's Automotive on 384 7th St. He truly fixed my car for a fraction of the cost. I am in the process of filing a formal complaint against Bob with the Bureau of Automotive Repair of California. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND STAYING AWAY FROM BOB.< /text>

<Text>2 weeks ago I woke up to my Jeep having been vandalized overnight and hopped on google to find a nearby mechanic I could have it towed to. Within 10 minutes of messaging them - I had a response from Bob’s Auto Service (Jonathan is AMAZING) and we got to work.
They submitted everything to my insurance within a day (two tires and my fuel tank!) and despite the struggles with getting a finalized estimate from the claims adjuster - the work was done within 24 hours once the dust settled. The entire process they stayed in communication with me, helped assuage my concerns, and were so kind to answer all my questions (not to mention the patience with my insurance company...)
Finding a forever mechanic is one of those “adult goals” and I’ve found mine! Never felt misled or like I was being taken advantage of as a woman either!
Thanks for getting my Jeep back on the road!< /Text><user>106958471541446290021</user><gmapID>0x808580f03941d71f:0xf01eaeef693b5695<//gmapID>< Rate>

Helped me out many times when I was in need and explained step by step of what my car needed, what the repairs are for and why it was recommended. Never tried to rip me off and up sell me things I didn’t need. Many friends have recommended me to Bobs after I had a terrible experience with another shop. Great people highly recommend them. They’re the best! I feel safe knowing I wouldn’t be taken advantaged of 👍< /Text>< username>

Passing through SF, I had a problem with my tire monitoring gauges on a dually.  I could not continue on any freeway until this was addressed.

I called these guys, and were the only ones in the area who bothered to squeeze me in for a quick fix.

I truly appreciate it--I pulled into their lot and I was on my way very quickly after they did their thing. They topped-off my air and I was out!

I'm from out-of-town, but I ask you to give these guys a try with your business.  I know if I'm ever in future need of car service in SF, this is the place I'll be calling first!< /review>

<text>A good friend of mines have recommended me to Bobs after I had an engine failure on my Nissan Rogue. The mechanics are knowledgeable, friendly and gave me good advise. At the end, he advised us not to replace the engine because the car isn’t even worth its value and the mileage on the car is already super high. Surely enough I spoke with my spouse and she agreed the same. Knowledgeable, friendly & honest mechanics. What more can you ask for? My wife’s car is due for an oil change and 30k service. I will definitely be returning back and using their services. Great people, great mechanics and super honest!!!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Rating>

We were so fortunate to only be about a block away from Bob’s shop. Jason, the mechanic diagnosed the issue and found a part and ordered it for the same day. He worked overtime and fixed it so that we could be back on the road that evening! Highly recommend this shop!

Bob’s Auto is fantastic. I drive a 2005 Toyota Sequoia with over 200,000 miles. They’ve helped me to keep it running well and do it in a way where I’m only fixing what’s needed, which keeps costs low. I only go to Bob’s!< /Text>

<Text>Jason  is such a nice guy and for the longest time I don’t know why I thought his name was Bob but I kept calling him Bob and he never corrected me. I only realized this when I brought my my mother here who knows him and she heard me call him Bob, she had no hesitation  to correct me. His friend the Lady at the desk is also really sweet and Jason’s son helps out around the shop too. He’s a chill homie. I love how this is a local family business. Being a north beach native i love supporting the locals. Bob, just kidding.. JASON, works 6 days a week until late in the evening. His prices are fair and his work is great. What I am most fascinated about is how Jason does almost everything from engine swaps, to wheel and tire/ alignment, work, as well as window replacement. The man does it all!  He’s like four auto shops in one!!! I definitely recommend him next time you get a flat tire, your engine blows up, or if a crack head smashed your window to steal the bag you left on the seat (HIDE YOUR STUFF IN FRISCO!) ! Go check out BOB .. I mean Jason;)< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808580f03941d71f:0xf01eaeef693b5695</Gmap_id><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

They quickly diagnosed my car problem, made recommendation and fixed it. The maintenance service is also excellent— a new driving experience after leaving the shop! Thanks Bob’s.< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Brought my early 2000 car in to get my brake pads replaced, battery replaced, and check on an engine issue. I brought in my own brake pads so I only paid for labor.

The past week my car was having an ignition issue, super weak anytime I started up the engine. At bob's they diagnosed it quickly to be a battery issue and it was a fast job!

In the past they helped me with several flat tires with fair prices so I knew I could trust them with my brakes, battery, and engine issues. Any time my car needs tuning or fixing I'll be bringing it to bob's.

Also - if you check in on yelp and spend more than $250 on labor costs, you get 10% off!</text>< Pics>

<text>As a “city person,” who doesn’t drive much, I was a bit unprepared when my 2013 Prius completely broke down on me while crossing the bay bridge on my way to work. When roadside assistance asked what shop I wanted to take my car to, I chose Bob’s simply because it was the closest to my work.

After dropping the car off and arriving to work, my boss had nothing but good things to say about Bob’s which definitely reassured me. I was further assured when Jonathan from Bob’s texted me right away with the initial diagnostics and options for next steps.

I understand that the Prius and hybrid systems in general are quite complicated but Jonathan and his father definitely have expertise in these models. They were super helpful through my lengthy questions and were always honest and professional.

I highly recommend them to anyone wanting a mechanic who is communicative and will work with you in a very honest way.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< userid>

I brought my Mercedes Benz for a tire change and a oil change. My tires were all worn out and cracked on the side. The mechanic recommended me Goodyear Tires and Kuho Tires because they are popular and good for my vehicle. They are stable and the tires look really really good. More importantly, the mileage on the tires will last. I ended up getting the all season tires for Goodyear. He did 2 Tires for me for $260 with installing and balancing the tires. For the oil change, he was able to do it for $85.00 with Full Synthetic oil too! Plus, I got a 10% off labor discount because my bill exceeded $250.00. I saved money and found a new place to bring in my car. They did a great job, provided excellent service and was professional throughout the work. I would highly recommended them to anyone who needs a car service/tire or oil change!< /Review>

It’s my first time coming here. One of my friends recommended me to come to Bobs after I’ve been to 4 other mechanics and they couldn’t find out the problem with my Chevrolet. Within the same day, they found the problem with my check engine light code misfiring and finished the job within a day and a half. I’m very grateful for their help and I’ll be definitely coming here from now on.</review>

Bob is awesome! My oil and brakes are long long overdue. Decided to stop by Bobs because they were the closest to me. My car is a 2016 BMW X5. For the oil change, they used Full Synthetic Motor Oil and made sure the fluids  are still good. He did my brakes and even showed me how close the brake pads were almost gone. Went into details and gave me very helpful advise and tips to keep my brakes healthy and to prevent them from going gone. Work was done the same day and I couldn’t be happier. He even saw that my back light bulb was broken and replaced it for me for free because he did not want me having a “fix it” ticket. Even I didn’t know my back light bulb was broken! All I can say is he’s a good person and a fantastic mechanic! Glad I stopped by Bobs today!<//Review>

The manager I worked with was very friendly, knowledgeable and professional. This is a very nice place because they don't pressure you into replacing something you don't need to do. Very professional mechanics that are fairly priced and gets the job done rapidly with complete estimates and invoices. Also while at it, the mechanic even checked if all fluids are okay, filled and visually checked for all other parts as well and made sure everything is okay. Highly recommend this place and will take my car here for future services definitely.< /text>< Name>

My car was making unusual noises, the brake lights and the check engine light came on at the same time, and my car wouldn't start. So, I brought it over to Bob's Auto Service to get it checked out. The mechanic easily determined within seconds and told me that the Alternator had problems and that the Alternator would cost around $500 for my Nissan. He did a great job, and within the same day, I got my car back! Car is back to normal and feels much more powerful. Will definitely recommend them.<//Text>

Bob's changed my Engine Control Module on my 2005 Ford Truck. They did an amazing job and definitely gave me a good price. The quote was $1,520, which was cheaper than the quotes other mechanics gave me. The quote was aprox $280 cheaper than other shops. Glad I came to the right place for my Ford. Pleasant service and will defiantly be back!</Text>

<Text>My car wouldn't start up on a Saturday morning. I had to call AAA to get my car towed. According to the AAA towing guy, they're quick, inexpensive, professional and gets the job done quick. I said okay and got the car towed to Bob's.  According to the mechanic, my Honda Pilot needed a new starter. The owner quoted me $400 flat for the starter. Called up other places and was quoted $650.   My Honda was ready to be picked up at the end of the day and couldn't be more happier.  I have to do my brakes soon and I know who I'm going to go to now.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Such a scam. We called them on the phone when our car broke down and they said that they would check our car for free. We brought the car there and it had to stay over night due to the fact that they were closing. At this point they told us that it would cost $30 to check it out. The next day they called me telling me what they found to be wrong and that it would cost $50. This was a $20 difference. My dad went to get the car towed and when he arrived they told him that the check up cost $75 and that I had agreed with them on this price. As I was not there, my dad had no idea what we had agreed on. They completely took advantage of the fact that I was not there. This has been a $75 difference in the initial agreed upon price. This company is what gives auto repair shops a bad name and I'm disgusted by the way they do business!< /Review>

Went to Bob's at 3pm for 4 new GoodYear tires for my BMW 428I because my tires were worn out. They told me it will by 5pm and told me to come pick up the car then. At the end of the day, my BMW looks stylish with those new all season tires. Quick, easy and efficient. Thanks!</review>

Made a trip to downtown S.F. from Sacramento to pick up a car, only to fund out they left me the door key only, not ignition too and they left the wheels turned so sharp I could not back the car out without hitting the car next to it. Owner unwilling to come down to give right key.......... so trip was complete waste of time. Too bad.<//review>

<Review>My front tire had a nail inside so I stopped by Bobs to see what they can do about it . The tire was not patchable because it was near the sides and it would be dangerous to patch it. So he insisted I to replace them because if I run on the freeway, they might pop and I would lose control of my vehicle which is something that I do not want to happen. He lifted my car with the vehicle lift and showed me how bad the nail and the tires were. He even caught that my back tires were also bad because the back tires were cracked and could pop open, but there was one that was still fine. But I decided to replace all of the tires because I wanted to ensure my safety. He was able to do it for me within the same day and my car was ready to go by the time I got off work. If I didn’t get a nail in my tire, I wouldn’t have known all of this. Bobs did a great job and I highly appreciate them for spotting all of that for me. 6 stars for Bob! Definitely returning back if I have problems with my car.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Came in for an oil change for my BMW X5. Oil change was around $85.00. Compared to the other oil change place I went to last time, it was around $100.00. I am definitely coming back to this place next time for an oil change. Saved $15.00 today! Feeling really happy right now.< /Review>

Came in for them to diagnose my engine light on my Hyundai. I had various codes for the check engine light and they gave me an reasonable estimate of everything that needed to be done. I went over my service for the timing belt and I’m super glad they caught it. The mechanic pulled out the timing belt and showed me that it was almost cracked and to its last breath. If they didn’t show me, I wouldn’t have known. I’m glad they caught it or else I would be paying more to get my car fixed. Thanks for your help Jason!< /Review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>The check engine light came on two days before labour day weekend so I was in a desperate situation! Arrived early on a Friday and was seen immediately. A couple of hours later and a quote came in for maintenance plus some preemptive work that could be done at the same time dues to ease of access. This quote was $300 and $400 cheaper than my comparison to other quotes by mechanics. Car was turned around by Saturday morning. A really great experience and service.<//Review>< Rating>

Brought in my Audi for an inspection because my brakes were making heavy loud noises. The mechanic took the brakes out and showed me how low the brakes are and how they are almost gone. I’m not that surprised since my son is the person that’s mostly driving the car. Thankfully, the mechanic showed me how bad the brakes were or else I would have never known. The mechanic was able to install new Bosch brakes and was able to replace them within a couple of hours before my lunch was over. They did a fantastic job on replacing my brakes on my Audi and I am pleased with their overall service. I will definitely be returning back if I have any problems with my Audi.< /Text>

My car was making super loud unusual noises. At this point, I knew I had to find a mechanic. So I called Bobs and I explained the situation to them over the phone. They told me to bring it down there so that they can check it out because it is hard to determine what the problem is. When I got there the mechanic Jason knew something was very wrong. Even he hears the noise from my car. I told him “Take care of my baby and give me a good price” and he said “No problem I take care of it don’t worry”. After leaving the car overnighted, Jason called me in the morning and told me that the struts needed to be replaced because that was the main cause of the problem. He asked me if I was driving on roads that lead to Potholes and to think of it I think I do since the area I live in an area where the roads where not too good. He also informed me that my oil change was long over due so I gave him the thumbs up to do that too. For the 4 struts on my ML350 he was able to do it for $3,500 and told me that my will be ready by the end of the working shift. Before the end of the day he called me and notified me that it was ready to pickup. After having my vehicle fixed, it was nice to breath fresh air after the problem was fixed. He was nice enough to even give me a free oil change since he felt that I spent too much money on this vehicle already. Such a nice person! And guess what? No more noises after the struts were replaced! He did a great job on my Mercedes and I would highly recommend Jason to anyone that needs their car fixed! Jason is the man and a life saver for my car!</text>

My car battery stopped working for my Chevy. I   called them in the morning to arrange an appointment to get a new one for my Chevy. Upon arrival, the mechanic tested the old battery to see what was going wrong or was the battery getting old. Turns out the old battery is not getting any voltage inside. So I had to jump start the car every time. I left my car there for a few hours while they ordered the battery and replaced it with a new one. My car now starts without having to jumpstart and I saved a lot of money instead of going back to the dealers. They’re the best mechanics I’ve worked with so far and I will continue to go back to them if I have any problems with my Chevy! Hope my car only needs a battery change and nothing else for now.</Text>

Went to this place because my check engine light came on for my Mercedes Benz. They diagnosed that the problem was the catalytic converter. Their quoted price was $1,640.00 out the door price. The quote was $800 cheaper compared to other quotes by mechanics. Agreed to the job and picked up my Benz Monday in the afternoon. I will definitely be back if I have any problems with my Benz!</text>

They were here for me when I needed someone to replace the driver side window! I called them at 3pm on a busy afternoon. My window needed to be replaced because someone broke into my window in the afternoon and literally stole a $20.00 USB port and cable. Who ever did this must think that breaking into my window and stealing a $20.00 USB port and charger was worth something to them.

Anyways continuing on! I called them up, gave them my VIN # and they told me how much it was to replace the driver side window for my Hyundai Sonata. They told me it would be around $320 to replace the glass window and that it would be ready before 6pm. Perfect, I shall come back before 6pm.

When I came at 5:45, they were cleaning up the broken glass that was on the mat in my car. The women said the mechanic had finished replacing my window and is cleaning up the old broken glasses that the person who broke into my car carelessly left behind.

After the job was completed, I paid my bill and left happily and relieved that my window was replaced. Next time, I’m not leaving anything plugged into my car anymore. Especially the USB port and chargers.

My experience with them was the best. They took care of me and my car, gave me a good price and was there for me when I needed them even though they were busy. I’ll be back to Bob’s if I need anything for sure!<//review>

<Review>I've been looking for a new mechanic for some time now but it's always been so frightening in the past for me to find one that I can feel and I can trust with my vehicle and who simply can do a good job. My best friend told me to go to Bob's Auto Service because they did a very good job on replacing her transmission and everytime when she has a engine related problem or anything big or small about her vehicle, they would get the job done and explain everything that needed to be fixed and why they needed to fix it. I tooked her word for it and went in the next day.

I worked with Jason but found all the mechanics super nice and friendly. They stuck to their original estimate for my water pump and timing belt, and when they found that anything else was broken they called to ask if I wanted them to change it out (My Tires) and offered to do it within a very reasonable pricing for my budget (I got the Kuho tires) I said no problem and they said they will contact me when all of my work is completed.

When I came to pick up my car, they showed me that my old tires are very worn out and were literally tearing apart. Jason also notified me that my brakes need to be replaced soon because as of now, they are at around 30%.

I will definitely go back to them for any of my future work on my car.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Good place to buy, sell, and perhaps even trade many types of valuables such as jewelry, watches, rings, a variety of tools, musical instruments, sports collectibles & memorabilia, etc. I sold a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses for a decent percentage of their original value. Very satisfactory experience. Definitely recommend Maine Pawn Shop and their professional staff!< /Review>

I’m really amazed by the employees and their kindness. they are very friendly and they negotiate on most prices. I purchased to amazing laptops and on both of them I got a discount. I will come back later and buy more stuff from them definitely worth coming. And more when they are willing to negotiate prices<//review>

Pretty much the nicest looking Paw Shop I've ever been to and that is with 30+ years shopping at Paw Shops. Guys are doing an awesome thing there. I am handicapped and tripped over a section of walkway. I told them about it and the very next time I was in, they had "trip warning" decals in place. They care that much about their customers. Now I have my entire family shopping there.< /review>

Best Pawn Shop in USA. The staff is the best, they are extremely friendly, and they work with you! I highly recommend anyone to come here first before you visit any other pawn shop or jewelry stores! They have great prices and great loan rates, and if you're selling you're stuff here give you a great offer! They offer 60 DAYS INTEREST FREE LOANS! 10 STARS!!!<//text>

I work a lot with shops and this is the best one I have been able to find anywhere near greater Los Angeles area. If you know of a shop that provides a 60 day no interest loan with no catch, let me know where! They also have other promotions that are excellent. The people that work here are good people that unlike other shops aren’t trying to milk you, but instead are trying to provide a legitimate business service. HANDS DOWN THE BEST!

<time>1590696424539</time><review>To begin the Maine Pawn Shop location is very convenient for me, however the excellent service they provide is the reason I return! The ladies and gentlemen there are very attentive. It’s a love hate relationship with the pawn shop, love going in there to “LOOK” but hate it because MOST of the time I’ll leave with a purchase of something! LOL.
Thanks for the fairness, when price shopping I compared other pawn shops to Maine Pawn Shop and this place has always offered more for my items.
By the way the stores facelift is great, unique look!Who’s idea? Two thumbs up.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>These guys are the coolest guys I’ve ever dealt with. And I’ve been to literally hundreds of pawn shops. They pulled all the stops to help me find what I was after (cool guitars) and even agreed to hit me up about a few other guitars that were coming out soon. They really know how to treat their customers and because of it they have my loyalty. Thanks guys!<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Some cool things they have there. Lots of vintage old things that you cant find anywhere else. Prices are high but it is also one of a kind.<//review>

I absolutely love this place. They have helped me in one of the most difficult situation that I've ever been in and the beautiful thing about them is that they work with u. I was afraid of losing my stuff that I got a loan out on due to financial hardship. Instead of them selling my stuff after the due date, they gave me a little bit more time to pay and I know a lot of pawn shops won't do that. I'm so thankful for this place for helping me in my most difficult time.< /text>

Only guy available for pawning and buying any guitars does not work Saturday. Nobody else is qualified, and by the looks of the guitars, this guy may not be either. Buts there's plenty of merch... No no

Another try, got what I would consider a fair deal on 4 items that used on ebay  this deal loaned me around 35% of their retail value, Nice guys, We'll see now how things play out.</review>

<text>I called and talked to jasmine to make an appointment with her, she told me she had an opening at 11am so I booked that time. I showed up at 10:55 am and she told me she a little behind if I could wait, since I saw she was almost done with the current haircut I said yes. 15 min later I looked inside and saw that she was giving another person a hair cut and just ignored me. Don't trust jasmines appointments as she doesn't respect them.</text><rating>1</rating><pics>None</pics><userid>115319434365228446806</userid></record>

Love it there!!! They are very profesional, súper friendly you feel welcomed once you step in, the stylists are always busy but they do a very professional work, when planing on doing color on hair better to make an appointment. They also do make up they do it very well just take a photo of what type of make up you will like or what clothes you will be Wearing to help them see the best look for you. If you have a hair style you will like to have they will let you know if that particular style goes with you or not. So to make it simple is a very nice place super family friendly atmosphere. Just remember bring cash. If not they have an ATM inside.< /review>

Anyways I went back inside my car and was going through social media when I look up and someone knocked on the door and they let them inside and a few other people too. I was so angry that I wanted to go and complain, but I decided not to. Never going to that place again. UGH.</Review><user>107330760441414891748< /user><Rate>2<//Rate>< gmap_id>

The wait time is horrible, the haircut was worst and to top it off even if you came with someone to get a haircut.. You still need to purchase something in order for you to use the bathroom. Wow...< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I went for the first time and they told me that there were 2 people first and when it was my turn they attended to the one who followed me and the lady told me that he had an appointment. Nothing professional, it wasted my time.

Fui por primera vez y me dijeron que había 2 personas primero y cuando me tocaba atendieron al que seguía después de mi y me dijo  la señora que el tenía cita. Nada profesional, me hizo perder mi tiempo.< /Text>

This location has consistently one of the lowest gas prices in the east bay. However, the Latina clerk who works at night is extremely rude. She's rude to every one and everytime I went there. They need to get rid of her.</Text>

Don't use your ATM at the pumps here. My card was skimmed 2x in 3 months at this location. Plus it's not the best price for gas in the area.
The carwash gets extremely busy on the weekends and, again, not best deal on price.< /text>

This rating is because I have made a few complaints on the guy that works in the morning named Nicandro he is very rude to me every time I come in. I stopped coming for awhile because of him. Monday morning 7/23/18 I came to get gas and he told me the bathroom was out of order. So I had to leave I couldn't pump gas while I had to pee. So the gas station lost money because he wouldn't let me use the bathroom. I returned later that day and the lady that works in the afternoon stated it was never not working. This is just one of my complaints on him. I'm a regular customer both of ladies that work there knw me pretty well. I have never had an any issues with them. I hope the owner pays attention to my complaints and either fixes the problem with this guy or just let him go and get a nicer and understanding employee like the 2 ladies that work there.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Magaly or Magali is the name of the girl who works, whenever I go for my little coconut game I see her very cool and a very honest person. Two days ago I kept my cell phone, even though I didn't have a password, she kept my cell and returned it safe and sound. ❤❤❤ Thank you very much !! We want more people like you.

It's a long wait in line if you want to see someone here. But the staff is very knowledgeable once you get to see them. They can help you with your situation right away and with the more difficult stuff they give you a handbook. A donation is expected when you see them as they are not funded by anybody else. The staff at this organization are tenants themselves. The tenants handbook will give you all the city codes necessary to fight your own battles but they also have a hotline you can call if you have a specific question. Parking is difficult in this area so you must get there earlier before they open. To get in you get through the metal gate in the front and go up the stairs. They accept credit card or cash. They were very helpful when I had issues with my landlord regarding illegal charges. I quoted back to their lawyer so many statutes that they gave up. the usual wait is being behind maybe three or four people. There is a restroom here you can use. It is not very handicap accessible.</Text>

I loved this place. If you're a renter dealing with a pesky and/or dishonest Landlord then this place should be your first stop. This non-profit organization provides expert advice and knowledgeable guidance to all San Francisco renters free. The Tenants Union staff consist of trained professionals who are ready to assist you in finding the best solution. With several years of experience in Tenant/Landlord disputes they are highly competent in all the current local codes and laws.< /Review>

This is the best ally to have if you are having any struggle with your landlord. I've used them multiple times in the last 37 years and I might be homeless without their help. That and the San Francisco Rent Control Board.< /Review>

<Review>The Tenants Union is a priceless weapon to help you fight against cutthroat, money grubbing landlords. The TU knows it's business inside and out, even better than the majority of tenant rights lawyers out there.
Living in San Francisco 22 years I have sought advice/information from the TU about three times. Each meeting they gave me solid, extremely insightful information.
A very good friend of mine just had his rent doubled from $1,100 to $2,200 a month even though he has been a upstanding tenant for the past 19 years in a row. Landlords that promote this modern day piracy against good tenants need to be held accountable. Luckily for renters in San Francisco the Tenants Union is there for you.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>Best experience so far with a car rental company. Hertz is improving every year,  the whole process was smooth and painless. My rental was upgraded without extra charge. Absolutely I'll repeat doing business with this company again and recommendations to all people that I know.< /Text>< Pictures>

Fast service. Friendly staff. The vehicle check out and check in process was very easy and fast. Plus their was a free shuttle back to the airport. 5/5 would go here again on next visit< /text>

< review>
I am very disappointed with my pick up today at Hertz LAX location. I’ve reserved a vehicle nearly 2 months ago and pre-pay for it. When I’ve arrived at the pick up location, I found the stall number assigned to me is empty. Apparently someone else took the vehicle reserved for me. Now they do not have another vehicle in same make and model and what the desk agent only offered me is something from a lower class. I’ve got 2 shocks to deal with, first my anticipated which is gone and second I’ve been offered something from a class below. When I’ve asked for a second preference, the agent replied to me that the vehicle is from one class upper and I’ll have to pay $75/day more to get that (4 days rental period).
I known the same make and model is not guaranteed always and rental companies usually provide with a similar vehicle in same class. If they don’t have anything in same class for a customer then they provide something better than the class originally reserved. I’ve called 2 days prior to my pick and add a note requesting a specific make and model to pick up at L.A. airport Hertz location. A couple of hours before I arrive to the airport I’ve even received an email from Hertz giving me my vehicle stall# in their parking lot which specify what I’ve book and anticipated with vehicle make model, color and plate number. I’ve also been advised the day before by a Hertz customer care agent that they normally hold any vehicle for 24 hours to pick up. Reason why I’ve called again to update my flight information just so that they know if there’s a flight delay they still hold my vehicle because I really wanted that specific make and model.
After so much effort, I still couldn’t get a vehicle of my choice where I’ve almost gotten it. Still don’t understand the the piece how that be assigned same vehicle to two different people or how they late someone drive away with a vehicle they didn’t reserve!
I am going to seriously consider a different vendor next time. And this is coming from a gold member!<//review>

(Translated by Google) All right with the car, it was great and we had no problem at all unless the answering service (over the phone) is very weak. I called to know where it was to deliver the car at the airport and the attendant only repeated the address of the airport but that was already written on paper, so ... if you do not need them, the young man who delivered the car in the Santa Monica store was very nice.

Tudo certo com o carro, foi ótimo e não tivemos problema algum a não ser que o serviço de atendimento (por telefone) é muito fraco. Liguei para saber onde era para entregar o carro no Aeroporto e a atendente só repetia o endereço do aeroporto mas isso já estava escrito no papel, enfim... se você não precisar deles, já o moço que entregou o carro na loja de Santa Monica foi bem simpático.< /text>

<review>My in-laws regret using this  company Worst Move Ever!!! First of all the movers were not professional using slang and foul language thinking my in-laws couldn’t hear them. That’s not even the half of it the driver smelled of sweaty pits and pot even offering to sell to my brother in law! At the end of it all the Driver even asked for a tip after he and his partner took everything we weren’t excited to keep modern day bullying never use this company they are bad people</review>< pics>

<text>Two men and a truck. That is ALL you will get, so the name is perfect! You certainly will NOT get customer service, movers with any packing or moving experience, a realistic price quote, any follow-up or follow-through, or professionalism. We had two barely adult males for our move during Covid-19 who had to be repeatedly asked to wear their masks in our house, and they refused to use hand sanitizer or wear gloves. They came ill-prepared with insufficient supplies for the move and it took at least 3 times the amount of time estimated at the initial inquiry. They literally THREW items into boxes without packing them properly only to be found smashed together in the poorly arranged boxes. They brought several wardrobe boxes WITHOUT THE BAR FOR THE CLOTHES, which you can imagine was awesome for keeping clothes arranged nicely. They damaged multiple walls, corners, and floors during the move. They said they would be submitting the claims internally, but we have yet to hear anything from them. Lastly, pray to god that you do not get Melissa on the phone in customer service, because she is heartless and robotic with no empathy whatsoever though she is readily equipped to take full payment in advance! The short, local move with Two Men and a Truck was worse than our nearly 3,000 cross-country move. Keep looking for a moving company and steer clear of these amateurs!</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Used them 2x movers are friendly. The agents that book appts and the managers give poor service, unfriendly and do not care about the customer. They were aggressive to get the deposit and book us and then when there was an issue, they couldn’t be bothered! Typical agents that only cares to be friendly to get the $ and then not assist the customer after money is given. I’m sure not all the customer service people there and managers are this way but there is a couple people I dealt with that led to this review. Make sure you get the right agents and managers helping you if you plan on using the Sacramento location. Also, beware of the deposit you are asked to put down for weekends. There is a large policy difference booking for a weekday vs. a weekend.< /Review><user_name>Thiri Ko Ko</user_name><userid>114420915692288269348<//userid><Resp>None<//Resp><Time>1620229536883< /Time>< rate>

<Review>My move was less stressful because of Two Men & A Truck staff. Office staff was responsive, very courteous, and conscientious. The actual movers were courteous and conscientious, not to mention astonishingly strong. Based on my experience, I'd recommend them to anyone doing a local move, and with all their stuff packed neatly in the perfectly-sized boxes they sell. I gave them 5 stars because they went over and above with addressing my concerns, but nothing is ever perfect so I'd actually give them a 9 out of 10 (minor items) and the 5 stars is a slight round-up.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

This is the 3rd time we have used Two Men and a Truck.  Always excellent service from initial phone call to the very end of the move.  The movers are very fast and efficient.  Would highly recommend.<//review>

I think that I should do a review.
I stopped using this moving company years ago because they provided unprofessional movers. The movers did not act professionally, immature is a better word, and they broke items each time because they goofed around. One of the movers was a veteran and very disappointed that such a person contributed negatively to the image of veterans. I advised my family to avoid this company and everyone has avoided this company ever since then.

It's just bad business practices.< /review>

< Review>
My husband and I were in the moving business for over 30 years. The move I experienced with Two Men and a Truck is the kind of nightmare we worked very hard to avoid.

My disabled brother needed to be moved from Carmichael to Citrus Heights, but his move involved three pick-up addresses. His family in the area haven't been happy about helping him move in the past, so the move was arranged by me from my home in New Hampshire — by phone and email. It was hours of coordination, accommodations, and confirmations.

On the morning of the move, one of the staff at the Sacramento branch of Two Men and a Truck phoned to tell me some of their men didn't show up that morning, so our move would need to be done "this afternoon sometime". That left five people up in the air: me, my disabled brother, and the individuals who had agreed to be at each of the pick-up addresses. Instead of bumping a move without multiple pick-ups, they opted to bump ours instead. A truly bad call on their part.

I spent much of that day convincing others to work with me, and running into resistance from one person because they didn't want to "wait around for the movers". At 2:00 that afternoon (California time) I'd gotten no updates from Two Men, so (being completely stressed)  I called them. My phone manner wasn't friendly, and their customer service staff member, Angela J. threatened not to do the move at all if I didn't give them my credit card number then. (If they'd needed the card number to do a move, they'd have gotten it when they booked the job, a month earlier). To "make it up to me" they offered me a 5% discount.

They have no idea how much their operations negatively impacted the lives of so many people that day. Given the hassle it caused, we'd have comped the job. But Two Men and a Truck are too big and too uncaring to respond to customer discomfort at an appropriate level. The movers did the job well but didn't get a tip because I'd already given the office my card number, which means they don't think about their crew members either. Unless you've have an easy move, find another moving company.</Review>

<Response>{'time': 1610474287739, 'text': 'Hello Robin, we understand your dissatisfaction with the office staff and thank you for your feedback. First, we would like to apologize for moving your move to the afternoon. It is not a standard for us to adjust move times the day of the move and we are sorry for the additional stress and inconvenience it caused on moving day.\n\nAs for the credit card information, we were not aware you were not going to be at the move location. Typically for a local move, we do not collect payment information until the move has been completed. As soon as we learned that you were not going to be present at the move, we asked for your credit card information. Also in regards to the tip, our movers never assume they are receiving a tip and it is up to the customer’s discretion to give the movers a tip.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to give us a call at 916.852.7411'}< /Response>< gmap_id>

<text>The team of movers were excellent! They were quick and professional. We were doing a in house move, some of the items were extremely heavy and their communication on how they were going to move things was excellent.  They covered our banisters to protect them, which meant a lot to us.  My only complaint is for the office, I called an left two messages that were never answered, I left them with a live person not a voicemail, if I had not called a third time I would have never gotten anything scheduled.<//text>< pictures>

Just want to give a BIG A+++ to our movers Christian Daniel and Mitchell. They are by far the best guys I’ve had the opportunity to hire and highly recommend asking for them!! They were Very polite and cautious going above and beyond to make sure everything was properly protected and moved with care and worked together as a team with a plan I can’t give them enough credit!! These guys don’t waste any time and are very efficient! And also the Gals in the office I can’t remember all of their names that I talked to multiple times as they checked in and helped out switching our move date and made everything SUPER EASY! Which is the way I like it! If you are looking for a stress free move this Team has it figured out and there is no hidden fees or added cost that are not discussed up front HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</review>

Do not use this company at all they have damaged most parts of my property and furniture. Their movers are very unprofessional rude and I also am missing a few items after the move.

Having to move into a newly purchased home during a pandemic was stressful for our family, but the work that our movers did, quickly, safely, and efficiently was a real high point in the process!

We’ve used 2 Men twice now and plan to use them again.  Better use of moving utensils could have made things go quicker and easier on the workers, but overall I’m satisfied as they got the job done within the time I anticipated.

For a larger move, however, I would ask for an estimator to give a minimum to maximum estimate on how many hours the move will take and to do so in advance of going on the clock.</Text>

These guys were there when they were supposed to be. The complaint we had was after giving specific instructions on 2 pieces of furniture to be disassembled and wrapped. They did not do that. We paid on a 3 hour minimum of which they barely used 2. They had plenty of time.< /text>

<review>I am extremely disappointed in all phases of the Sacramento franchise's work and customer service. I employed them to unpack my apartment and pack two UPack moving containers for transit from Sacramento across country. I employed a 3 man crew and bought the package including padding. The crew worked quickly and seemingly did a sufficient job, so I was requested to sign a waiver saying that the job had been completed to my specifications (I obviously could not foresee damage that would take place thereafter). Upon arrival, I also employed two men and a truck to unpack the containers at the destination city. Upon arrival, extensive furniture damage was noted. A sentimental family antique desk sustained extensive scratches and dents. Several expensive dressers and bookshelves sustained scratches, dents, and a leg had broken off completely. Another bookshelf needed to be discarded after it had been destroyed completely. The destination crew commented repeatedly on the poor job that was done packing by the Sac crew, noting that they had "f***ed" me by doing such a "s***ty" job packing and improperly padding the furniture. He stated that despite having personally done repeated cross country trips that he had never seen such poor quality packing, and he took over 30 photos to document the damage apologizing effusively. I was disappointed in the process, but assumed that the Sacramento franchise would right the wrong. However, before I could speak the woman I spoke with preemptively told me that this was not the Sacramento franchise's fault and that I voided my right to issue a complaint by signing the aforementioned waiver. Besides, since I was there while they packed, she reasoned, I should have spoken up if I didn't like their work. She didn't comment on how I was supposed to forsee the damage that would take place. She declined to explain why the team didn't instead serve as their own quality control to scrutinize their own work. Instead she insisted despite not being a professional mover and wholly unqualified to assess it, I was responsible for performing quality control of the work provided rather than them taking accountability. She also repeatedly insinuated that UPack may have dropped the container in transit, despite evidence pointing to a lack of proper padding and poor packing. She refused to comment on why the destination team would say these things to negatively indict her team's work if they weren't accurate, but she deflected blame saying that the comments were unprofessional (fine... but the comments didn't damage my stuff... the poor packing did). Defeated, extremely frustrated, and not expecting any (likely appropriate) reimbursement of cost given her combative responses and blame passing, I said I would drop the issue if she apologized and took accountability for the work provided, but she defiantly refused. I am exhausted from this experience and am disappointed that they refuse to hold itself accountable for the service provided when an unbiased professional questioned it on the destination end. Not their problem I was told. Terrible<//review><Date>1598133523459< /Date><Pics>None< /Pics>< Gmap_id>

I recently moved from Sacramento to Reno and used two men and a truck and have the say I  am very pleased with the service I received.  After getting multiple quotes from other movers they came in at a reasonable price and  After signing the contract were very attentive to my needs and I'm sure it was the reason for such an easy transition.< /Text>

<review>These guys were great! I highly recommend Christian, Wayne and McKinley. They were polite, conscientious, and efficient.Our quoted rate was by the hour and these guys hustled! They literally ran up and down the stairs. They didn't waste one idle second. I was SO impressed! They wrapped the door jams and the furniture.

Had a great experience with these guys. They came into our home at 8:30 in the morning and the 3 of them packed us up (1800+ sq ft) and had us moved into our home by 5:30 that evening!  So far absolutely nothing broken.  Real gentlemen. Boxes were all labeled and when arriving at new home the boxes were taken to the correct rooms. Their prices for material and labor were extremely reasonable. We actually came WELL under the estimate originally provided us. Id recommend them to anybody.
This was my second time using them. They actually moved my office from West Sacramento to Sacramento about eight years ago. Same great experience.<//Text>

The problem comes in with the damages and their insurance.
Lets start off with the actual team of people doing the move, they will dictate EVERYTHING. We got the "D+" team, the guys were not bad, they just did not seam to work as a team. One guy was only 3 days in, so he knew nothing nor did he really know how hard moving is. So before lunch time he was dragging. Now that meant the other two had to pickup the pace and workload. That ultimately took its toll on them, which ultimately lead to all of the damages.

What should have taken 5-6 hours took more than 9, which by the way you are paying for all hours they are on your property until they tell you I'm taking you off the clock now.

Damage to my BRAND new house, hole in wall, damage to hand rail, damage to furniture. ETC, ETC.

Now to where the problem becomes more deep rooted with the company. When you ask what does this insurance cover they will tell you if it gets damaged they will replace it at no cost to you less the deductible if you have one. Is this a training issue, or is this how he WAS trained. I asked on multiple occasions if a damaged item would be repaired or replaced if I purchased the insurance, every time I was told REPLACED.

-Insurance, Full value replacement, does not mean replacement. It means if we cannot find a way to fix your item then we want you to provide us all the information of where it was bought when it was bought, how much you paid for it including the receipt for it.

While I am not saying this moving company is any worse than any other company. What I am saying is I think the Sacramento branch does a poor job training their crews. I think their sales tactics are deceptive at best. I think they could do a better job setting their teams up for success. I will think long and hard about hiring them again or referring them.<//Review>

<rating>1<//rating><text>We booked a local move and were given an estimated cost and told the office on the confirmation call that we'd like to have some furniture taken to the dump. They said no problem and even looked up local landfills to determine which one they could drop the furniture off at. The movers didn't finish the job so I had to rent a truck myself the following day. When I contacted their office to let them know the job wasn't complete, they told me there was nothing they could do. Their reasoning was that the move was estimated to be 10 hours, but because they clocked out at 9.5 that they finished early. They clocked out, but the job remains unfinished as I still have things that need to be taken to the dump in my new house. Terrible customer service from Nathan in the office. We knew 2 men & a truck were more expensive, but had heard that their customer service was amazing so we were willing to pay for it. We were sadly disappointed. Look elsewhere for better customer service at a lesser price.

Edit: They've taken the time to respond to a bad review before they've returned my calls to their office. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else</text>< pictures>

If I could give zero stars I would.  I had set up and confirmed a move using these guys in San Diego two weeks prior to my move date.  On the date of the move, no one showed during the scheduled start work window.  Finally, after 45 minutes of waiting, I get a call from them telling me that they all of a sudden could not "fit me in" and asked if they could reschedule me for the next day.  As I had to move out that day and was relying on them, this was unacceptable.  As a consolation prize, they generously did not charge me a cancellation fee, as if they were going to even though it was their fault.  Safe to say you're better off renting the Uhaul for $20 and moving yourself, you'll get better punctuality and service.  Safe to say I will not be recommending this service to anyone I know.< /Text>

On 1-22-19 I used Two Men and a Truck to move the contents of a small storage unit to a larger unit within the same facility. During one of my three phone conversations with the company, I was informed that the cost for the job would be $139 if an hour or less. I specifically questioned and received clarification about the price in order to avoid being overcharged and was led to believe that the job would be charged on an hour-by-hour basis. Tim and Lee moved the items and did a terrific job. Unfortunately, I was billed $417 for a job that took 30 minutes. I contacted the company to voice my concerns about the bill and was told I would not receive any sort of refund. I even told the Customer Service Representative, Katrina Stevens, that I'd be more than willing to pay $200 for the job. Unfortunately, she told me I wouldn't get any of my money refunded. I strongly feel that I was misled by this company and ended up having to pay an unreasonably high price for a miscommunication that was the company's error . I will never use this company again and will be reporting them to the BBB as well as the Department of Consumer Affairs.< /review>

<user_name>Lil Belle<//user_name><time>1524284131347< /time><rate>4<//rate><text>Update* The customer service staff is really great, the girl that called to ask about our service was very understanding and passed our concerns on to a manager. I got a call from Alan and he was very helpful and understanding and resolved our issues. I’m going to chuck it up to an off day for the staff and changed the rating to 4 stars.

We used two men and a truck today and had the absolutely worst experience. We closed on a house and had to be out of our rental ASAP so I called to set up an appointment. I spoke to a woman and we went through the inventory of what would be taken, I stressed that the largest item we have is a 4 poster cap king bed, she said no problem. I requested an afternoon appointment but she said that because of all the items we had we had to do the morning appointment and there is a 3 hour minimum. I agreed because I needed someone ASAP.

The movers arrived around 9am, we showed them what was going and they started to work, all good so far. Not long in we can hear them already complaining and one of the workers is clearly working harder than the other. 3 hours in they clock out to take a lunch and at this point only half the truck is full, pretty much had only put the sectional in and a few boxes. Okay, fine we go to get food too. While gone we get a call from the company saying the workers called and want a third person because it’s more stuff than they thought and they don’t want to do it even though we’ve only just hit the minimum hour requirement (and even though I spent a good 15 minutes going through an inventory on the phone) it’s also only a 3 bedroom house worth of stuff and we weren’t having them move any of our TVs or stands.

We told them we couldn’t afford another $60 per hour. We get back to the house and the workers ask if we got a call, we tell them we can’t afford it. Half an hour later a manager shows up and asks us for a third time if we want a third worker and tells us how much faster it will be and that they don’t want their workers going over a certain number of hours (then they should have 2 shifts and not make me pay extra) we tell him also that we can’t afford it. They call another manager who offers for us to only pay $30 more an hour and we just give in so they’ll stop asking. The manager also mentioned that the house was bigger than expected, I told him that I told the woman on the phone that we moved from a 1300 sq ft house into a 2600 sq ft rental and are moving back into a 1300 sqft house and that several of the rooms were empty so we only had 1300 sq ft worth of stuff and they weren’t even taking it all.

Third person shows up and is it any faster? Of course not! It took them 9 hours to move a three bedroom house and on top of it they didn’t even move everything that was on the inventory. We now have to rent a uhaul to finish moving the stuff they couldn’t. And to top it all off, they forgot the hardware for our bed and refrigerator and I had to drive 45 minutes each way to the old house to go and get it, they took an hour off I guess but I still paid $1300 to be bullied into paying for a third person just to have it take 9 hours with complaining and not get all of the stuff I needed moved. And now get to spend even more money finishing their job< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1524157952766, 'text': 'Hello Nicoel, I am sorry that we could provide a service that would exceed your expectations as that is our goal.

The actual fact of moving is very stressful for the average person who for whatever reason has to move. But the men and women of Two Men and a Truck eases those emotions< /review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I called for an estimate to move some larger items from my previous residence about a mile away. The woman insisted on reading a script to me regarding all of their services. As it was pretty lengthy, I stopped her to remind her I wasn't moving, I just needed a few items moved. She went back to her script. There seemed to be no end in sight, so I stopped her again to let her know I don't need packing materials or anyone to pack for me - all  wanted was an estimate for moving my few items. She seemed confused. When I mentioned one of the items was a small freezer chest she let me know it needed to be emptied; when I tried to explain to her the size and the weight and that my husband and I moved it ourselves last time, she cut me off repeating "it has to be emptied." Didn't seem to be the least interested in hearing what I needed done for the job or helping me get there. These are all things we moved ourselves before - we could do it again, but I don't want to. Luckily, I called someone else who actually lstened to what I was asking to have done - I had a quote and a scheduled   appointment in under 5 minutes.</Review>< Pics>

We would only recommend this company for those living in apartments or similar-sized dwellings.  We had some of our house items going to a storage unit and some going to a temporary rental, and their one-size truck didn’t even fit all of our storage unit items.  Moving is not one-size-fits-all, so highly recommend going with a moving company that can send an appropriate-sized truck to match the size job so it can get done with one truck.  Additionally, they seem to have poor communication between the actual movers and the scheduling office staff, who most notably left out that the house was two stories.  Schedulers also did not convey that items would need to be moved from a smaller storage unit to the consolidated larger storage unit, leaving movers unprepared with respect to both activity level and time required to complete.  We’ve learned our lesson, and when we move out of our short-term rental into another house, we’ll be using a different moving company.< /Text>

{'time': 1486407920871, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear that you found your service unsatisfactory. We make an effort to provide exceptional customer service in every aspect of a move. Our customer service representatives work hard to accommodate the needs of any move, even if the need is 9 men and 3 trucks, but ultimately it is up to the client to decide the crew they would like for their move. The reason we only have one size truck is that when we are required to move more items than we can fit in one 26 foot box truck, not only do we need more storage space, we need more men to move so many items. It is most efficient for us to bring out 2 trucks and 2 crews instead of one larger truck because we need the extra men. Loading a larger truck with only one crew would take much longer and would be far less cost effective for the client. We would be happy to answer any questions you may have, so feel free to give us a call at 916-852-7411.'}</resp>

<Review>Overall Excellent Experience!  Our movers went above and beyond our expectations and really made this an enjoyable move. We think the price was very fair and have been telling everyone about the value of a service like this.

This was the first time that we hired a real company to help us move and not had to beg family members to reluctantly bang our furniture around and then complain about how heavy everything is. We had a piano this time and several other large pieces of furniture so we seriously contemplated professional help with the move.

The name, 2 Men and a Truck is exactly how my experience was, straight to the point and no hidden "gotcha" or fee.

The two guys that came were early/ontime and showed hustle from the beginning to the very end. Our 2700 square feet house was loaded in the truck in 2 hours and they were already on the way to the new house. When we left to follow the truck I look at my wife and she was singing so I knew it was money well spent.

We arrived at the new house and they asked us where we would want all of the items and we went through each room and said this there and that there and so on and they got back to work and in a few hours everything was in place including the piano!

I think that everything above  so far could be expected but where these guys shined, is in their customer service skills. They were so friendly and talked about things that made us forget that we hate moving and actually enjoyed our time. They are good with kids too. Our little girls handed one of the workers a flower that she picked on her way home from school and he put it  in his hair and kept it there the rest of the time and the girls loved it. :)

I forgot the guys names but I think they were on Sactruck116. Please recommend to use these guys as much as you can. I think that you will get more reviews like this.

Thank You,

-Paul<//Review>< Pics>

<review>DON'T USE THIS COMPANY! They are horrible. They took forever and were in no hurry. They took eight hours to move a 950 square foot apartment. We called to complain about how long it took and the men being rude. They sent extra crew to help and then charged an extremely high price. When we disputed the price and told them their staff was incompetent and rude, they offered a 5% discount. When we told them that price was still too high and would not pay almost $1000.00, they told us that if we didn't take the offer they would sue us for three time the amount of the original price (1100.00). They're the most rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional people we have ever worked with and regret ever hiring this company.</review>< Pics>

< review>
I drove my 90+ Grandmother to have her things taken out of storage and put into her new place. Upon arrival wee see nobody there, we wait and wait , suddenly I see a big white truck/moving van parked across the street from the storage place in a mini mall parking lot with 2 guys in it,
they are watching the storage place it appears, I finally ask my Grandmother if that white truck across the street might be them, she said no if they were watching the storage they would have asked us if we were there to meet them, ok.  15 minutes goes by ad I see the guys still across the street, we are still outside the lot in the parking area and several cars entered the storage and the guys never came to ask anyone or even the office what was up. Finally we are giving up and I say why not ask those guys if they are waiting for someone at the storage lot, we do  and the tattooed driver says yes we are, I say we have been there 4 minutes and they never  asked us or others a thing just hide across the street.
Apparently the driver was thinking a customer will start looking in nearby lots rather than the storage place we were to meet?
It was a freak shot I even asked them or even saw them .
Next the driver sees the U shaped drive and says he canot drive into the storage yard he must load from the parking lot since the truck wont make the turn , which I assured it will and told him I have a clas A license and will do it for him, he insults me saying I'm ful of SXXt and a Fat sexual epitaph ! which pissed me off, I had a pulled abdominal muscle or we would have gone at it right there!
The guy pulls in  and backs out finally after my convincing him backing out is easy! We did have some valuables stolen but of course like Jaywalking there are not many times anyone's caught but it happens daily. They lollygagged, insulted, hid,  and threatened to leave with some of our stuff left in their truck! I would never recommend them ever!<//review>

This place really messed my move up.   Not only are they overprices by a huge percentage to their competition, but they just don't have their "act" together.

On the day of my move, at the last minute they had some "double booking" issue in their system.  I waited hours for them to figure it out.  When they called back they were going to send a smaller truck, and one less but still try and charge me the same price!

I ended up having to hire my sons friends to help me move.

Save yourselves the headaches, and your time.  Steer clear of this company.< /review>

Two Men and a Truck prides itself on being the best full-service movers around and we’re sorry to hear that your movers did not exceed your expectations.\n\nLet me explain first that we are a full-service, expedited mover. You also have the security of our fully trained, full-time staff who are licensed, bonded and background checked, as well as being insured by us, at no extra charge to you (unlike most companies who will charge a fee for this).\n\nOther companies will give you a lower estimate, but your items are placed on a truck with as many other people's items as they can fit. Your move is dependent on other drop off points and can take as longer to complete and you will not know where your items are in that time. With Two Men and A Truck, we have GPS equipped on all our trucks and you can call at any time to find out where your truck is on the route.\nOther companies will also have hidden costs, fuel charges, service charges, levies and taxes and at the end of your move, your price may well be far higher than expected. As they have your items on the truck, you either have to adhere to the price, or not receive your goods. Our price will be locked in and you will not pay any more than you were quoted on the scope of your move.\n\nAll of these reasons and more are why our service is worth the cost -- plus, we will always come out and give you a free in home consultation which will give you a binding quote, which may well be lower than your range and then you can make the choice as to what your peace of mind, security of items and a quick and easy move is worth."}</response>< Gmap_id>

The worst customer service ever. I had a appointment with “Lisa” she had me waiting for 50 min. Come on if someone makes a appointment keep your word. Oh but she text me if I’m late to my appointment or not show up she we’ll charge me 30$. This was crazy my apartment was at 12:00 not 12:50< /Text>

The menu is short and sweet! Pick a ramen bowl, add extra ingredients if you want, or grab a rice ball with your choice of stuffing.

Plenty of Asian snacks and ingredients too, if you want something to go.</Text>

<Text>I miss this place.
Unassuming place to get the best espresso in the area. High quality beans extracted carefully, as long as the right person is pulling the shot. Their ramen is good, make it a combo for a hearty meal.
The onigiri saved me from starvation more than once, as they serve as perfect meals for commuters. I recommend the salmon or pork sausage.
If you like sake, they sell bottles.
It's a great place to sit down and read a book, or to get some work done.
Water is freely available, the ambiance is calm and understated. It's not the kind of place to go once and be blown away, more like the kind of place you can rely on for good coffee and food any day of the week.
They carry some packaged Japanese snacks, as well as some very high-quality condiments that are otherwise inconvenient to find in SF. That part of the store is expensive, but you are into high quality soy sauce, tsukudani, or sake, this is a good place to find it.</Text><user_id>117726701695427395990< /user_id><name>J<//name><response>None< /response><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rate>5< /rate>< time>

The lunch special of a half ramen bowl with an omusubi is one of my favorite meals on Polk. Their ramen is on the lighter side -- perfect for a lunch that won't leave you feeling heavy and sleepy. They also have a variety of delightful tea and coffee drinks, not to mention a lovely asian grocery store with a well-currated selection of sake.</Review>

If you're used to instant ramen than this is decent. If you've ever had ramen from Japan or Mensho or even Katana-ya then you'll be disappointed.</Text>

Wowzwers. This is seriously the best coffee shop in the city. They've got not just fancy coffee, but also fancy tea, fancy ramen, and fancy beer, sake, etc. They also got some pretty fancy desserts. Go here!< /review>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>I just had the most delicious vegetarian ramen. I became pescatarian 6 months ago and I'm a ramen lover. Leaving the Tonkotsu broth behind has been a challenge simply because vegetarian broth are usually disappointing but THIS ONE is the best I've had. Common Sage is now my favorite place to go. I live on the East Bay, but I'll travel for this. Thank you Common Sage cook, you brought me hope in my search for a good ramen as a pescatarian. 🙏<//Review>< Resp>

Small inside area, sort of a weird hybrid of corner market/carryout/eat in. The Common Sage ramen was pretty good, though. Be warned, if you buy alcohol here, you can't consume it on the premises.< /review>

Deli store with seating at the back for a quick stop to eat. Ramen miso is the recommended choice from nice staff. Also wifi, room for wheel chairs though it's not ideal. No restroom</review>

<text>Miso style ramen is thick style broth. Pre-made probably the same day. It’s good in a pinch if you live in the neighborhood. They will make to-go orders.

A Fast casual place, you order at checkout counter and wait for food to be delivered. This is more of a grab and go food type of place then sit and enjoy.<//text><Resp>None< /Resp><time>1577519714977</time>< GmapID>

Sesame latte is delish. It’s caffeine-free and dairy-free if you get one of the alternative milks. Vegetarian ramen is also pretty tasty! They have lots of little snacks and treats. Try the honey cake!< /Review>

Nice surprise this place. It looks they do coffees but surprisingly also ramen as well as a grocery shop full of Japanese goods, good but doesn't seem authentic, there's something different about it, something alternative. Luckily the garlic paste changed everything. I also had a matcha latte. Nice cool and chilled place</text>

<text>First!!! Great atmosphere and top notch ice coffee.  Seems like a Japanese European fusion with things like made to order sushi balls and same to freshly baked bread and quality cheese selection.  Only issue is lack of seating and high prices.< /text>< pics>

SUPER cute little store on the corner. I never really noticed it was there until I looked for today in search of a sandwich. I thought their turkey sandwich was pretty average, but I really liked the cheese. I also got a salmon rice ball, and it was a lot of fun to unwrap and eat. Just don't wait a while to eat it like I did, or you'll find some parts of the rice mushy from all the humidity.

I can't wait to come back and try their ramen!< /text>

I absolutely love this place! The Ramen noodle soup is very good, the omusubi are excellent. I love I can get all that food on the go. Pastries are great too.

I do regret that they sell less French food nowadays when they used to sell French and Japanese food equally. I guess the market is not so big on French food in the neighborhood.

You can also buy wines, sakes and beers in addition to your regular drinks and your hipster drinks.

Service is super friendly!<//review>

Love this place and visit often for lunch. Veggie ramen is great and they have an excellent garlic oil you can add to your ramen. Pleasant atmosphere with communal seating that usually isn't crowded. The staff are welcoming and helpful with menu questions. Fun specialty foods to look at/purchase while you're waiting for your food. Sizeable alcohol selection.</Text>

I ordered Ramen and onigiri combo.
I was not hungry, so ramen was half size. Onigiri (mentaiko) was warm!
Staff told me, they make onigiri after they took an order. So fresh!
But if you are so so or hungry, you should order regular size :)</text>< username>

It's a small grocery with some healthful but tasty options for ramen, sandwiches, and rice balls! Also small selection of pastries, Sightglass coffee, and drinks. Lots of sake and other liquor options.< /review>

Chashu pork sandwich was a bit heavy, but I really enjoy their omusubi  (rice balls). Cheap and small portioned snacks with clean and simple ingredients. Yum! They also have ramen options which you can't find anywhere else on Polk St.< /review>

Yummy quick eats.

Even my picky ramen eater of a husband liked it! I've been wanting to check this place out ever since it opened, and I'm sure I'll be back. We both ordered the $9 Common Sage ramen and while it wasn't the tastiest ramen ever, I'm glad that they are in proximity to me without a 2 hour line around the corner (*ahem* mensho). I did wish the ramen came with a soft boiled egg or perhaps one more slice of chasu, but it's not something that would stop me from going back. The menu also has a variety of onigiri that I'd love to try.

Seating is a bit tight - don't expect to bring large groups to eat in. Best for couples and singles that plan to eat fairly quickly. Sake and wine line the back walls and a variety of Japanese snacks line the store front. I haven't tried their coffee, but I plan to be back soon.< /Review>

<Review>Cool little Asian++ cafe and market. The musubi here are the best small items to nom on, esp the pork. Looks to be the same chashu as what's used in the ramen, meaning you get a nice slice of hot pork in your rice ball!<//Review>< Resp>

<review>Had the Cha Shu Ramen, broth had no depth of flavor, and noodles were factory made and simply warmed up from a freezer. Employees working were nice, but it took far too long for our ramen to come out. Being a frequent traveler to Japan...I know how ramen should taste and this place is a sorry disappointment.< /review></record></dataset><record>
<text>Such a cute little shop! It can come off as a bit odd since it's basically a liquor store that also has a kitchen that serves up onigiri, ramen, and breadstuffs. Oh, and also tea and drip coffee. It's kind of a lot to take in.

That said, the onigiri is SO good. It is always freshly made so it's always nice and hot. Tuna onigiri like that is pretty much amazing aa it's extremely comforting. I have yet to try their ramen.

The best thing is that this place is open early. I've gone here a couple of times and I think the best times to go are when the Asian gentleman is quietly running around the place. It just seems to have more order when he's there - he's probably the boss. Last time I was there when he wasn't, the service was quite slow. They may have also been new employees, though.

I've gone twice in the morning and that seems to be when the best service is available. I'm still going to stop by in the evenings to see if the pattern holds true, but overall, a great spot for fresh onigiri and yummy soba tea. Drop an extra two bucks for a day old pistachio brownie if you're feeling a chocolate rush.</text>< Rate>

Ramen is delicious and filling for both body and soul. Common Sage is the Hapa love and intersectional culture Nob Hill needs. Considering there are no ramen places nearby unless you go to Japan Town, this is a true gem. Replete with a delicious selection of Japanese snacks and liquor, Common Sage is no common store and most certainly will not be saged.<//text>

The ramen here is SO GOOD! The noodles taste a little buttery and the broth is savory. The Cha-syu Miso-Ramen has double pork which is perfect for super hungry nights (I get the Common Sage Miso-Ramen when I'm not as hungry). Corey has amazing customer service as well! He's always educating me on the latest treats in this expansive European/Japanese boutique store.< /review>

(Translated by Google) In Japanese;
"Hey, tea" costs $ 2.50. We use every day. There are Japanese snacks. "Squid, Pocky, Senbei, ...". There are miso ramen and rice balls. Because it is made at the time of ordering, it is a "hot rice ball". I sometimes buy beer, such as Asahi beer, Sapporo beer, sake (sake), and wine.

(Original)
In Japanese;
「おーい、お茶」は2.5ドルです。毎日、利用しています。日本のスナックがあります。「スルメ、ポッキー、せんべい、、、」。味噌ラーメン、おにぎり（おむすび）があります。注文時に作りますので「ホカホカのおにぎり」です。アサヒビール、サッポロビール、お酒（日本酒）、ワインなどなど、時々ビールを買っています。< /Review>

I find myself going to the Culver Center regularly as I live in Culver City. Parking is usually plentiful if you know where to look sometimes the first rows that you see are rather crowded but if you go past them you'll find parking.</Text>< pictures>

This is a great little-known place to do it all, from going to the gym to shopping to eating Chinese or even shopping for electronics.<//Review>

<text>I was overjoyed when I discovered it on the internet. Many of the pieces they use are cheap. I had more than enough resources to offset the costs of shipping. In a high-end robe, I was polished to the nines. It was a great adventure. I'm going to buy it again!< /text>< response>

<text>Nice mall, ample parking, great shops. I went to the Ralph’s, the Supercuts and the Best Buy. Everyone was really nice and I found what I needed.

They are about to open up to full service  again, there are a lot of places with outside seating that looks really good, a New Mexican bar and restaurant among them which I will certainly try out as soon as it is safe.<//text></record></dataset><record>
<review>In one of my dreams, it's a bus station. Commuting is the most popular mode of transportation that can be accomplished in a variety of ways. There are several food courts, clothing stores, and attractions to choose from. The shopping center was spotless and well-kept.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< time>

Tons of restrooms, and a lot of activities for the entire family.</review></record>

Shop at Ralph's a lot friendly courteous service.
Best Buy is sort of medium - bought 3 gamer notebooks there, gamer means expensive.  Last one they didn't honor the guarantee so I bought a couple in City of Industry. Decided to give BB another try, ordered a $4500 Razor Pro 17 and twice they inexplicably canceled the orders after 6 days? Finally bought the notebook directly from Razor. Took 5 minutes and 6 days later I have the notebook. BB is good for cables and connectors.
T- Mobile is also there. T- Mobile is VERY strange. They sell the best phones, they give excellent cellular service, but the people in the store can be rude and ignorant. I have very good experience with my T-Mobile service, just don't expect the people in the store to help you do anything.<//Review>

Lots of small local shops to enjoy - which is also a double edged sword. Want Walmart, a Dollar Tree, or anything budget friendly? Besides the single 98¢ and up store it ain't gonna happen; Walmart isn't even close enough for deliveries. But, I guess that could be viewed as a good thing, depending on your preferences.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I prefer this location because they open up late till 2:00 a.m. where there's no traffic nor people shopping late.
They have a bigger variety than other smaller Ralphs in the area.
The stuff are usually nice and helpful unlike other locations because I usually don't go for Ralph's and Westchester for example because it's always a horrible experience always overcrowded very long line this location has a different experience they also carry extra variety of groceries and frozen section.< /Review><time>1611039905491<//time><pics>None<//pics>< gmapID>

It's ok , The Police needs to frequent the area though , day and night because the vagrants and the homeless keeps loitering the premises going into the stores shoplifting , sometimes threatening some of the staff , even the security guards , it doesn't look good the. CCPD needs to patrol daily and hourly I've seen it .</Review>

Probably a low point in my life when i'm reviewing a shopping center, but hey, here we are.

The Culver Center is, wow, let me tell you...it's something. Is it in Culver City? Yes. Is it central? Kind of. What else do you need to know? Well, that's where I come in. I'm your host - Justinthemoodtoreviewashoppingcenter.

Besides thrills, bills, and frills, here's what you're in for:

Best Buy. You know this place. They aren't aptly named but they are conveniently located right here.

Sit n Sleep. I don't think i've ever seen anyone in here.

Ralphs. Still beyond me why you would name a grocery store after the act of vomiting, but i'm just some guy who writes reviews for shopping centers on Google Maps. What do I know?

LA Fitness. How come no one ever uses the phrase "buns of steel" anymore?

T-Mobile store. They have telephones there. You know the types.

AT&T. More telephones. More types.

Rite Aid. CVS is overpriced, and yet Rite Aid always feels like an overpriced CVS. How do they do it?

Yogurtland. Probably my favorite country.

Pampas Grill. For those hoping to be reminded of the South American lowlands in the form of grilled meats.

Hand & Stone Massage & Facial Spa. BECAUSE YOU NEED TO RELAX.

European Wax Center. No doubt named after the great Culver Center itself.

O'Reilly Auto Parts. So you can shop for that car wax after you get your body parts waxed.

Oh, also, there's parking here, but it can be annoying. Enjoy!

I'm your host. <smug smile>< /review>

So so so sad its reduced to a parking lot, pretty much! I wish best buy was open because it's just better to have the one on one exchange before purchasing or making any plans for the future!

<Text>Bad parking lot. Terrible drivers don't help the tight situation. A guy tried to back into a spot next to us but bad aim on his part he would have hit us if my husband didn't maneuver away.

There's usually something major going on in the 2nd floor open area - a lego building competition was going on when I hit it and if I had more time I'd be right back there building a Death Star or the like.< /review>

The typical busy tourist attraction people visit when going to sf.... honestly overpriced and super crowded in an everyday basis, especially around the holidays and weekends and there's lots to see, but it's a hassle to find/ get yourself here without being in traffic or having to find parking or wait for several busses to transfer here. The famous sea lions also reside here, so there's also that< /text>

Its for convenience and has a little of everything but the design of the plaza is very strange and parking is challenging with the layout so I usually walk when visiting here< /Text>

So many stores! So much parking (relatively)! There's a great variety of stores from Ralph's to Best Buy and everything in between. We highly suggest parking by Best Buy as that doesn't get as busy as the Ralph's end. Everyone says it's old but I don't feel like it's significantly older than anything else in LA.< /Text>

Culver City center it's a good place to relax and enjoy dinner with friends and family.
One of the things I like about this place it has various restaurants it has theater and it has a famous Culver City hotel and  the bar and food is great.
My friends love to come here for the bars and I love coming here for the food.<//text>

<review>I love the pier 39 atmosphere. Its just that some people took advantage of the tourists here sometimes. Two guys approached us asking if we want free CDs. After that they requested us for tips. I took out a 5 dollar bill, and they were asking for 2x20 bucks. I said I would like to return the CDs but they insisted and since they were both big guys, i thought I just gave it.  knowing that i'm from out of town, i guess they just took advantage of us. Geez. Other than that I enjoyed the food, the shopping area, and the sealion.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<text>This shopping area is convenient. Nice to be able to get to a Best Buy and Ralph's simultaneously... sometimes. I like the Coffee Bean on the corner as it's often chill enough to relax for a moment. Would be great to see this retail area start working on entitlements for a much denser development. I think Culver City's rapid development warrants it, and this block needs to answer the growing demands of the community.<//text><Response>None</Response>< Date>

4 stars because parking can be scarce (there is street parking though). A pretty good place with a variety of shops and restaurants. I usually go to the Ralph's market and Best Buy.<//Text>

<Review>Decent. I assumed this selection would be greater given that I was no longer in Denton Texas. A pretty much similar variety of items though. It was cleaner than most thrift stores I've been to, prices weren't exactly at thrift store prices. I guess that is to be expected being in California.</Review>< rating>

My experience at the Culver Center was quite nice.  I went to Sit and Sleep to exchange a mattress.  My salesman listened to my concerns regarding my back situation and reccomend a better mattress for me.  It cost me a bit more than my previous mattress but my back is feeling better already.  I highly reccomend Sit and Sleep to anyone shopping for a new mattress.< /Text>

<review>Parking ALWAYS sucks. What makes this so frustrating is that they have security that is supposed to help you find a park. But what I notice the security doing is hanging out in front of 24 hour fitness, drooling over the girls in their workout gear. Thanks for all the help... perhaps I will show up in my work out gear this weekend!<//review><user_id>115492875481532911272< /user_id><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2ba307892e615:0xdc3027be2275a164</gmapID><Rate>2</Rate>< pics>

Plaza is OK. Has essentials like Ralph's, some reataurants, including a Best Buy and LA Fitness. But it's too compact, there are no where near enough parking spaces for all the traffic it receives, so it's usually very congested. I would advise not to visit during the after work rush hour. You could be in stand still traffic for over 20 mins just to park.<//Review>

Ralphs has good options especially with the Tillamook Ice Cream flavors. T-Mobile and Best Buy along with Panda Express is all right here.< /Review>

An all-round center. Restaurant variety, Ralph's Grocery, Rite Aid store and pharmacy, gym, phone shop, Best Buy electronics, Bank of America, nutritional supplements, etc. Parking is adequate, although it can pile up during peak hours. Friendly, calm, atmosphere.</review>

Parking is a nightmare. Best buy, Ralphs, BofA, LA Fitness, and a million other places with a lot of traffic makes this place a pain to get in and out of. They have parking attendants sometimes who mostly call tow trucks on people they think aren't shopping in the plaza or stand around talking to each other.<//Review>

<review>Best Buy all good, Ralph's a little understocked but it is a bit smaller than some of the other supermarkets. Parking can be difficult at times.</review></record>

I did some shopping at Ralph's and Best Buy's. Both stores had everything that I needed, and I was in and out of there in no time flat. I really enjoy going to places and shop with no problems<//text>

<text>I like Culver Center and shop there regularly. There are sometimes issues with loitering but whenever I report it to management, security quickly takes care of any issues. In the busy times there is never enough parking for demand and it can get stressful. Welcome to Los Angeles. :/ Overall I like the shops and the employees.<//text>< Pictures>

I love the convenience of this place - but the parking is the worst!! I’ve had to cancel appointments here because I was unable to find parking in either the front or back lot after driving around for 15 minutes. It’s seriously the worst.< /Text>

<review>I went to the Brazilian restaurant in the shopping center. The food was good although some of the meat was a little bit dry it out. Most of the other items were very tasty. Service was good, the line was long but moved along fairly quickly. The parking was horrendous. Certainly not enough parking the amount of stores in that Center.<//review>< pics>

Grew up coming to the Culver Center and the parking lot situation is a joke. They don't have much of a store front. The gym used to be a good place to workout, not so much anymore.< /text>

<Text>This parking lot is ALWAYS full, especially around the LA Fitness, you have better luck parking on top of the Best Buy and walking, or behind the LA Fitness and walking around.

My car got broken into here at the top of best buy; there are NO cameras up there, and security doesn't check up there. So if your a car thief it's a great place to shop. Culver City police also doesn't really do anything, so BE CAREFUL up here.

The worthwhile places here are the LA Fitness; the brazillian food place, cafe 70, and yogurtland. Kthnxbai. The clothing store around here also just closed by the car/auto parts place .I feel like stores don't survive in that location very long (the clothing store that closed).<//Text><gmapID>0x80c2ba307892e615:0xdc3027be2275a164</gmapID>< Response>

Most of the restaurants have 20 minute parking in front of them so you can't just park in front of the place you want to eat. They are very serious about the 20 minute parking, I parked about 25 minutes and they called parking patrol on me to give me a ticket</Review>< pics>

< Review>
The Culver Center is a well-stocked cavalcade of various retailers large and small, nearly spanning the entire imaginable range of consumer needs. Perhaps I am biased because it is conveniently close to my residence, but it seems like the foremost option in the area when it comes to a sort of "one-stop shopping." Restaurants of varying quality, pharmacy, electronics, supermarket, auto parts, mobile phones, apparel, etc., you name it! In a space of  roughly four to six square city blocks, you got it all and then some. However, during any time when shopping is a common pastime for the majority of employed adults, you will find the parking situation is a nightmare! I have no tips for coping with this if you must pay a visit on say, Sunday afternoon, but be patient. All crowds ebb and flow with time.< /Review>

Culver Center is a great shopping center with lots of good restaurants like Panda Express, Baja Fresh, Smash Burger, CPK, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. Small chain stores like GNC, GameStop, O'Reilly Auto Parts and Sit n Sleep.  Some bigger stores like a very nice Ralph's, Best Buy and 24 hr Rite Aid. Various cell phone stores like Sprint, T-mobel and AT&T. Also an LA Fitness and various beauty and tanning type spots.
Being on the corner of Overland and Venice it is very easy to get to by. Car or public transit.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I came here to go to Ralfurz.
The shop was big and the lineup was good.
Is parking a bit small because it is in the town? I thought, but since it went dark, it might look wide in the daytime! ?
I felt so big here because I used to go to the smaller Ralfurz.
There are a lot of reasonable ones, and there are also ones that are higher than others, so it is necessary to check! ? think.

(Original)
ラルフルズに行くためにここへ来ました。
お店は大きく、品揃えも良かったです。
町中なのでパーキングは少し狭いのかな？って思いましたが、暗くなってから行ったので、昼間ならば広く見えるかも！？
小さめのラルフルズに良く行っていたので、ここは本当に大きく感じました。
リーズナブルなものも多くあり、逆に他よりも高いものも有るので、チェックが必要かと！？思います。<//Review>
