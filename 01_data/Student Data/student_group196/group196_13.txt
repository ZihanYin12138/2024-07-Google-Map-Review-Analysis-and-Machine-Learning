<review>A minor fender-bender is better than a major accident any day of the week, yet the logistics of what happens after can either make the experience a nightmare or keep you counting your blessings. Happy to report my case is the latter.
G&C Auto Body repaired the back bumper of my car and I couldn’t be happier with the result. From the agent who booked my initial appointment, to Debra (so courteous and knowledgeable) who estimated and managed the job, beginning-to-end, I appreciate you keeping me updated every step of the way. Thank you for a professional, high quality customer experience, and swift completion of the repair work!<//review>< username>

<review>I brought my automobile  to G & C  Autobody
to repair damage to  my right bumper.
I meet with  Robert  Silva, he was cheerful, friendly
Polite and very professional.  Robert  was very knowledgeable and described every detail  of the process  for the repair. He  followed  up daily
with updated  reports on progress  made.
My auto repair was completed on time.
I was amazed  with the finished outcome  of
my car.  Outstanding  work, job well done.
They also washed and wax my car. 😄</review><username>Fred Jones< /username></record>

<Review>Insurance sent me there for rear bumper repair.  They gave the car back with the rear bumper obviously messed up. Took 4 weeks and multiple phone calls and a bunch of "someone will call you back" to get the bumper replaced. Finally took it back and was told it would be done in 1 day so i coordinated with work and my wife's schedule just to be told it wasnt ready until about 1 hour before they closed. They didn't offer to give me a loaner car or rental until i started to get an attitude with him. Just got it back recently and it looks good the second time around.< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
MORE UPDATES- This shop has made it clear that they will try to counter attack all my media outlets to cover up their mistakes. Prepare to see additional FAKE positive reviews on Yelp, Google, Facebook, etc etc etc etc. For some reason they also believe that the moment a customer is reasonably mad after two weeks of them having their vehicle as well as multiple trips to their location for incomplete work it some how let's them off the hook. No matter how angry a customer is at their lack of quality work it does not justify the crappy work that was done PRIOR to them getting upset. If someone punches you in the face and you yell and scream at them for hitting you, is the person who punched you now not wrong for assaulting you because you got upset at their action of assault?!?!?!? This shop has it TWISTED! They are not magically  off the hook for a customer getting loud and a customer getting loud didn't magically make someone go back in time to do the screw ups that led the customer to being mad in the first place!!!!!!

UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE! Since the below review I have since returned and the staff was absolutely HORRIBLE! Not only did they try to BS a BS'er and try to convince me to accept their crappy work they also jerked me around for over an hour! After I pointed out that the truck STILL WASNT FIXED CORRECTLY, the staff member named Prit AGREED with me, took possession of the vehicle again and promised me a car rental so I can make my baby's first ultra sound where I would hear the heart beat for the first time. Had my vehicle been ready I would have made my appointment, had they gotten me a rental like they promised I would have made my appointment! HOWEVER, they left me sitting there for an hour and then tried jerking me around. They then told me they would not provide me a rental, after an hour! Plus the truck wasn't out and done so I was stuck! I have multiple emails, texts, pictures, videos and more documenting many things such as their threats to leave my truck parked outside un-supervised all night in a bad area, etc and MORE!

******Below is just my FIRST experience not including the above AND more!*****************

It is my goal to recapitalize my visit to the G&C shop so there is no confusion. I am extremely frustrated that I missed hours of work, dragged family members away from plans as well as rearranged family plans/child care around picking up a vehicle G&C claimed was ready. This situation has cost money, time, special asks with work and favors from family.

It is extremely concerning that my vehicle could so obviously be NOT ready and horribly done but yet G&C attempted to deliver it to me this way claiming it was complete! There is clearly still damage on the rear passenger side where a larger dent use to be. It did not take a magnified glass or special angles to see it! It is so blatantly obvious that if I were to walk out of a store and notice the existing dent that I would actually FILE A CLAIM for the dent that is still existing after G&C "completed" their work!

In addition, the top of the driver's side truck bed which was damaged is still obviously bent down. It is contorted enough to result in the plastic liner not sitting true against the truck. In no way does this truck bed look like it came off a showroom floor, which is how it looked prior to the vandalism. The G&C shop has done a piss poor job so far and I am extremely concerned with how this will be handled moving forward.<//Review>

Derek Pierce took amazing care of me. Dropped the car off on a Friday got it back the next Friday. Set clear expectations and even stayed until 6:45pm (they close at 6) on a Friday so I could pickup my car.

Happy customer, give this guy a raise!<//Text>

If you need work done, please go see the wonderful team at G&C Auto Body!

I hope I never have to go to another Body Shop again in my life. But if I do, I'm going straight to G&C Auto Body. These guys were super professional, from my initial phone call and greeting at the front with Laura G to the porter who was attentive to making sure my car was ready for me when I got there, thanks Devante B. My car looked brand new when I arrived thanks to the awesome work of the Tech, Brendan W, who worked on the vehicle and the entire process was a breeze thanks to the easy going writer, Chad F, who made sure I got OEM parts on my car and got it back within 24 hours - something I was not planning to have happen.

During these times of quarantine due to Covid-19 the people that are still at work keeping America and Americans going are a true gem. I'm sure it's not easy to get up every day to go out and work with the threat of an virus that we know nothing about. A virus that has led to the death of tens of thousands (by this post). G&C and the team mentioned above made my experience seem like it was a regular day and for that I am grateful. You guys have my patronage, always.</Text>

I was in a minor fender bender and the insurance company recommended that I go to G&C Auto Body in Larkfield for an estimate. I was originally going to go to another body shop for the repair, but these people were so welcoming and friendly I decided to stick with them. Wow, good call! Fast, efficient, conveniently located, loaner car, no problems dealing with the insurance, did the work on my busy schedule and with an absolutely beautiful repair. Thanks to Jamie and Luis for making my car accident into an amazing experience. I will definitely be back and I highly recommend this shop.</review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Our repair consultant , Derek, called us to come and pick up our repaired vehicle late one evening. We had to come from Sacramento to the shop in Fairfield. When we arrived he told us the insurance company hadn't paid the second installment for the repairs. He. was unable to solve the problem and furthermore was not too interested in getting the issue resolved. His resolution was for us to go home and wait for the insurance company to pay. We called our insurance company on our own to see what the problem was. They assured us the payment was made. Derek got on our phone and some time later came out and sheepishly admitted the problem was solved. It took well over an hour just to pick up the car. I wish I could give them 0 stars. I will never fo back.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Great experience the staff treated us like family and since our car was being repaired due to a severe car accident that significantly injured my wife and my mother-in-law that extra kindness is unforgettable!  The work on the vehicle exceeded my expectations.  G&C made a difficult time for my family and I so much less stressful and for that I will be always thankful.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>G&C Auto Body was on the list that my car insurance gave me after a man had hit my bumper squashing the bumper corner.

It was the 2nd place I went to to see if they would accept my insurance's estimate. The staff at the G&C Auto Body in Fairfield were great! They greeted me and were friendly and cheerful. Brynda took care of everything even reserving the car for me and kept me up-to-date on any changes. The end estimate was even higher but insurance covered it less the deductible. I am happy with their professionalism and friendliness.< /review><gmap_id>0x808515d465cf4d23:0x1f392d2c1bb6e819</gmap_id>< user>

<text>They did a very good job replacing my bumper.  Very friendly nice people that make you feel very welcome during what is usually a difficult situation.  The only reason its not 5 stars is they hung my bumper incorrectly and left a gap.  I had to discover this after taking my car home (I took delivery in the evening and did not initially notice it).  Obviously it was an inconvenience for me, but they fixed it very quickly and now it looks great!<//text><Rating>4<//Rating>< user>

<review>Burned a hole in my backseat (not sure how that was even possible) and rear bumper is falling off... and that wasn't even related to the area of damage they fixed! Worst experience ever at an autobody shop. Not trusting GEICO either--an endorsed location.< /review>< gmapID>

<text>I'm a very happy customer. My BMW was hit by a Geico insured person. This was my 1st time having to experience a Geico insurance  claim. I must say my experience with Geico was a 10+. My experience with G& C Auto Body was above and beyond my expectations.  (10++) From me setting an appointment , to meeting Harris one of the employees at G&C auto body to look at the damage to my car. My repairs were excellent, the communication about the time frame of my repairs were a 10+. I would highly recommend G & C auto body for any repairs for insurance or just to get needed body work for your vehicle.</text>< user>

<user_name>Keith-Curtis< /user_name><Time>1623045600136< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I recently purchased a new car and was anxious about where I would get my windows tinted. My experience with Jet Black was pretty stellar.

1) I called the (510) phone # and spoke to an agent who got me scheduled in less than 5 minutes (also was stoked to discover this location here in San Fran.

2) Showed up and was greeted by the branch manager, Ibrahim, who showed me the different tints, a visual/physical demonstration with a heat lamp to show climate response, and a total.

3) Walked over to Gus's Community Market 3 blocks away where you can sit outside and enjoy coffee or pass by the time (which is amazing because Jet Black does not have a seating/waiting area).

4) Returned 2 hours later to an awesome job.

Cost ended up around 350 tax included-- keep in mind I chose the Ceramic tint versus the other tints (which looked also pretty stellar).

Overall, amazing job to Ibrahim and the staff. Appreciate your services both in the detail as well as making the process as a customer enjoyable.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>I went to one of their other locations in Walnut Creek about 6 months ago and they did a pretty good job since then got a new car and moved to San Francisco and found out they have a new location so I was like oh cool I already know their name. Then I looked online they had a deal on their website got the whole car done for 140 bucks. Want to use their other location I had a group on but I'm pretty sure that what I paid with the deal on their website was a better deal than the Groupon. Of course that deal was for like the cheapest kind of thing they have I guess they have three different grades you know the top one being ceramic I got the cheapest one, and my car is hella dark you can't see inside it. They did a great job... Thanks jet black<//Text>< Pics>

Had my Avalon windows done. Ibrahim was super helpful in the details of the job. Got hooked up and even got to tour the city while waiting. Jet black tint was recommended to me by a friend. I had a good experience and satisfied with the work.<//text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Date>1617511339987</Date><Review>Initially, I was pleased to get a same day appointment. The call center was very nice and efficient as were the in person staff at this San Francisco location (at 1st). TL;DR: double quoted wait time, mess left inside car, trunk and no mask usage by staff / don't clean equipment before/after customers.

I was quoted 1.5-2 hours work time. I had even upgraded from a partial tint to tinting the whole car (still with same quotes time). I didn't receive my car back until 3.25 hours later! I came in at 2 hours and noticed they'd just began working on my car despite saying there was only 1 car ahead of me. I was scolded by the manager for coming in w/o being called - likely b/c of this discovery. He said it'd be just 30 mins. That turned out to be an hour later.

I had my car detailed just before I came - there was water all over the floor and floor of my trunk, stains all over the door paneling and dirt tracked into driver's side floor.

Also, the manager and staff working on cars did not wear masks or gloves. Even when the manager came into the office, he'd only wear one as he entered the office. The salesperson signed paperwork after touching his mask and had me use the same pen.

ZERO apologies for the delay, no compensation offered despite me tripling the original service I asked for. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone!< /Review>< Response>

Hard to tell in photos but all 4 windows of my brand new 2021 charger are scratched! All workers aren’t wearing mask or gloves. Was quoted $149 tint but the kept insisiting to get the ceramic tint which I did, I paid for the most expensive tint and the work done was horrible! Even I can do better. Tint is full of dust and air bubbles. Lastly the worker quoted 1 hour and a half but I waited 3 and a half.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Came in today.  Had to use my friends profile since I don’t have an account. But I would like to express my experience here. I have gotten tint plenty of times. I know the bubbles go away eventually but there’s lots of dirt!! I can feel it in the film!! Also one large line on back windshield which I believe is a crease.

Never  👎. Terrible work.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I did my 2020 Rav 4 here last month and the job was absolutely amazing, the reason I gave the review after one month is because they told me it took 3 weeks for the water spots and tiny bubbles to go away but I didn’t believe them but as I waited, they went all away and it looks beautiful< /review>

Even tho it was a 3hr wait my daughter and I enjoyed the little park around the area the outcome was great just not when the guy that drove my car out he drove too quick almost hitting the guy in charge but he moved n almost hitting me but I moved, I hope that guy will know it's not ok to drive out that fast especially in front of the person in charge and customer knowing he can potentially hit someone.. But wit her than that they did a great job with my windows</text>

<Review>I dropped my car off here they called me 2 hours later and told me my car was done , when I returned to the place my car was still parked in front of the binding untouched I asked they guy why they called me if it wasn’t done , he said he’ll get on it now and it will be done in 30 mins after a hour and 30 mins of waiting he brings my car out with the wrong front tints ! then he offers to redo the tints just to still do it wrong again ! At that point I just left but never will I ever come to a place like this</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Really bad job tint, my tint has bubbles in it and it's also poorly cut and fit in my car and not to even mention had me waiting until closing with another 2 people that also got a bad tint job, never going back or getting a tint job from them.< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Heidi at Foundation Homes was very professional and friendly at the same time. I highly recommend her services. It is so worth the money to have a professional help with finding and setting up new tenants. The experience of creating a contract with the new tenants is valuable because communication and expectations are clearly laid out and everyone ends up with a clearer understanding of what is expected. It was easy to work with Heidi because she was so responsive and knowledgeable.< /review>< pics>

Mike Kass was very thorough and kept us informed as new issues surfaced with our property. I am very pleased with the service he has provided.  It has not been easy renting during these pandemic times, with our older property needing a lot of work.<//Text>

<Review>Excellent A+
The lease agent answered my first call within 30 minutes and met me at the condo the next day. It was rented within the week. Every aspect of leasing  the property was taken care of professionally, expeditiously and with full communication every step of the way.  I am only sorry that I did not find you sooner.  I will return to you without hesitation. I couldnt  have had a better experience with my first experience with a leasing agent.  A hearty thankyou</Review>< name>

{'time': 1618936363501, 'text': "Hi Susan,  Thanks so much for posting your review and alerting us to a problem.   For tenants who wish to self-tour at approved properties, ID's are required as a safety measure to protect our properties from damage/theft for our properties that have self-access showings as an option (the same technology as used by AirBnB etc).  Tenants generally love this option - as do our clients! -  as self-showings allow us to efficiently accommodate so many different schedules and rent homes faster, often within days of coming on the market!  However, once you uploaded your ID to the portal you should have received an email and/or text from our team with your approval and you could have accessed the property per your own schedule. I can see from your name in our CRM software your request that came in this past Saturday, but it doesn't look like a showing was booked, possibly through the fault our of PM who was in the process of signing a lease. If the process and status was unclear, we apologize, generally it is a pretty streamlined experience.    That said, we don't have any record of you reaching out to our agency to report a problem, request help with your showing, or report the ID theft...and we do track every inquiry and touch point with our agency in detail.  We not only have a phone line staffed 24/7, but help email published front and center on our website and a 24/7 chatbot offering additional support.  If you had trouble viewing the property, we wish we had known so we could have had a chance a help!  However, regarding your stated ID theft, we'd like to get more info and see if anything went wrong on our provider's end and see if we can help.  We assume you've filed a police report?   Please contact us direct at hello@foundationhomes.com and see if we can help!  Thanks again for taking the time to post your review and we hope you found a great rental."}<//Resp>

Throughout the whole process she was responsive, informative, and super helpful. When we submitted all of our documents to apply, she didn't hesitate on calling our references and presenting everything to the owner. We are so thankful for Heidi's help and we can't wait to move into our new place!</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Dianne Moratta did a fantastic job renting out our single family home in Larkspur.  We had specific parameters for her that definitely made the listing more difficult (odd dates for rental, furnished, etc.) and she made it happen.  She was very professional and friendly, but honest about what needed to be done.  She found us a great tenant and we would recommend her to anyone looking to rent out their home in Marin.< /Review>

Victor was our appointed Contact at Foundation Homes from day one. He was always very friendly, engaging and timely in following up to any requests.
Foundation has a very streamlined communication process and quick to address any repairs and concerns, which was very refreshing.
Unfortunately, the home we were renting was to be sold, otherwise we would have definitely stayed.
We highly recommend any quality home listed with Foundation.<//Text>

As a first time landlord,  I found comfort in Chris and Darcy being “locals” in the Marin marketplace and they came highly recommended by a few close friends.

Heidi, who was the actual leasing agent, kept me informed on a regular basis and was always responsive to my questions and/or requests.  Looking forward to long relationship.

<review>Foundation homes has been managing our property for over a year now while my family is living overseas. They are wonderful - very professional, prompt and reliable. They’ve now found us 2 separate tenants and we trust their judgement and selection criteria.  We are so happy having them on the ground to deal with the unexpected. Victor, our property manager, communicates clearly and is very responsive. He handles everything so we don’t need to be concerned.

And BOOM! from there on, Dee and Victor took over. They are absolutely awesome, easy to work with, understanding and very helpful with all the paperwork and getting the home ready. THANK YOU!

<Review>As an International Property Management trainer, conference speaker and consultant, I've trained and worked alongside the very best property management companies globally. Therefore it's easy to spot a top performance business. In the USA, it's hard to find a company as good as Foundation Homes, led by Christopher and Darcy. If you need total peace of mind with your property management, I believe Foundation Homes is easily within the top 1% in the country for performance, service and the ability to take care of and manage your investment. Without doubt, your best choice.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>We own house in Sausalito which has been on the rental market for over 30 years.
Michael Kass has been,  by far,  the best agent I have ever dealt with.
He is the consummate professional.
He is very well informed as to the neighborhoods and what pricing will get your place rented quickly  and properly.
He is very knowledgeable as to market rates, how to present a place, and how to negotiate.
For the past few years, whenever we have called him, he always answers promptly with the appropriate information.
I would highly recommend him to anyone.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808590ae51d658f7:0x7b347cc49506fc32<//GmapID></record>

We have been working with Foundation Rentals & Relocation for almost a year now and the experience has been absolutely wonderful. Christopher, Darcy, Michael, and Victor are always available, and their knowledge, expertise, and all around professionalism is truly a breath of fresh air. Michael had saved us more than once when we were in a bind and needed a good, quality company to fix an issue with our home, and this has saved us a ton of money and headaches. Not only is Foundation great at what they do, they are decent, real people. Keep up the great work!</Review>

<user_name>Terry Thomas</user_name><text>I'm always willing to give feedback and I try to make it worthwhile to the organization requesting it...not just a lazy "10" and a lot of platitudes...that doesn't offer anything substantive and also reflect my belief that we all, certainly my work, can do better.  I'm going to give the less than satisfied first but obviously from giving 4 out of 5 stars, the pro's dominate...

Context: I have had my house on the market, using Zillow, networking and no agent, twice in the last year, last fall at $12,500 then $11,500...and then again starting in April dropping from $11,500 to $10,500. At each of these levels I showed the house to multiple prospective renters getting one offer at $9,500 and a short term offer last year at a premium (but didn't entertain or even ask for a number).  We were informed by professionals (friends in RE) that the market was softening.  Our objective was to rent it for one year, open to a two year lease. So, we did not achieve our objective with Home (or on our own).  We only had one showing at the $10,500 listed price with Home but that was only a week or two (I recall) so not counting that as a negative, just a fact. Then we received interest from a short term (4 month lease) prospect and we  accepted them as renters because, 1) because of a premium ($3000) over asking and, 2) they took it totally furnished with added flexibility on what we could leave in the house. I should add that they are local and well established in the community.  So why the 4 stars? Victor stepped up, not only in general about being responsive to the urgency to get this done on by the prospective tenants and our request, but in handling numerous last minute changes on the lease by the prospective tenants. What I perceived as needing to nudge Victor was, in retrospect, my having managed the process so not allowing fully for not only his having more than just us as a clients but also a rigorous (sometimes to a fault) process to adhere to. In the end I don't hesitate to give Victor his due, he came through like a champ.
A final, somewhat indulgent and non-substantive comment which I already expressed to Victor and admittedly just one person's opinion: the voice that answers the phone when I call Victor's direct line is...somewhere between very hard to listen to and...awful. I know it is popular to get some Brit, Aussie or Kiwi, all countries and people that I like and admire, to answer the phones at businesses and while they are generally pleasant enough, they are always pretentious...but seldom as pretentious and even ridiculous as the one I am referring to...no offense intended to the person behind the voice, hopefully that is not her natural. speaking voice.

So as not to end on that note, let me say again...well done, 4 stars and I will recommend Home Foundation and Victor to others, (particularly if he can get the deposit money to me promptly! :)< /text><resp>None<//resp></record>

The best I've been to!! And the price is unbelievably affordable, for everyone. The cleaning in and out was excellent, through and through. Friendly, personable, and professional employees. Nice area to wait outside. And you can watch the whole process if you want. I won't be going anywhere else!<//text>

Best car wash in Solano county by far!! They were friendly , professional, and ACTUALLY cleaned my very dirty car for a great low price!! I have been ripped off many times before paying twice the amount and still having to go home and clean my interior and exterior of my car!  Kudos to this business for being “ old school” in offering great service at an awesome value!  I miss the days when more businesses had  that ethic of offering good service with competent employees at a reasonable price and I as the consumer actually go home satisfied with the whole experience. !  I will definitely recommend this business to others. Thank you again.<//text>

<review>The carwash was good but the one who gives the bill, the one who asks you what type of wash you want is rude. I just told him that all the paper inside my car's door pockets are trash and he already frowned.

They are good and quick. Close to home. I like that they clean the rubber mats included with what you pay and don't charge separately for each one. Should have been going here. They have good scents. Nice shaded places to sit inside and out. Prices are affordable.<//review>

I have been coming to this car wash for over ten years. The value is great, staff is always friendly and they do a good gob. For those that feel they didn't do a perfect job, just bring it up to them and they will take care of you. Anytime I may not be 100% satisfied I have just brought it to there attention and it is taken care of. sometimes they get busy and the wait may be a little long but I go there expecting that. I get my turn and they do a great job. worth the wait<//text>

Sometimes wait is a little long. That’s not a bad thing though business is good because they are good. Great job and affordable. If you have any special spots you want cleaned they hit it up. Best around for sure. Had a cheap window visor come off workers were scared and manager addressed issue. Told them no worries it was cheap with double side tape. It was cool they were super concerned and addressed the issue. Rather then try to hide it. They are honest and get your car looking good.</text>

I have been looking for a hand car wash forever! I found them by Googling "car washes near me" and this was the only one that came up without a machine. I can only give them 4 stars because COVID-19 does not allow them to clean the inside, only vacuum. My car came out really nice though! ✔✔😜</review>

You guys usually do a great job cleaning my vehicles but I have to say I’m a bit frustrated right now as I just left your car wash for the third time that you guys have closed earlier than your posted hours. Would be a good idea if you posted your correct closing time!</text>

It is nice, my vehicle didn't get cleaned on one side, it had to go through again to get both sides clean. The workers were very friendly and helpful and took care of the problem sending me through the wash a 2nd time for free.</Review>

Having missed spots ,watermarks or not properly placing mats in is not a big deal.But multiple scratches and 3 chip marks is extremely unacceptable. I usually wash and detail my new truck myself,but due to busy lives we live I decided to try this place out.I figured 31 for a (detailed)wash  would be worth it.But now not only do I need to detail it myself but also pay to get these scratches and chips fixed.Im not here to bash anyone on working hard for their living,but now I need to work twice as hard to fix this.<//review>

<review>I have been coming here for years and let me tell you this is the only place in Vacaville that you can get a total hand washed vehicle.

Other car wash facilities say their touchless but they're not machines scub your car and they leave fine scratches on your car this place is amazing everything is hand washed perfectly each time leaving your car perfect each time.  It is worth the wait.

I have also have gotten my car waxed and have been very happy with the results!!!!

Thanks guys<//review>< user>

<Text>After taking my car in to get washed one of the employees broke the panel that houses my electric seat controls. I picked up my keys but did not move the car until after they were closed since my wife was busy. I realized that the panel had been broken but could not contact them for a couple of days since they were closed due to the rain. When I did contact them a few days later the owner insisted that he did not break it. He told me that he would pull up video footage and show me that he moved the car himself. I tried to explain to him that it was probably done during the cleaning, not moving and he said that I was calling his employees dumb and that I was a liar. It is really a shame because the part is only $100 and I would have replaced it myself. Unfortunately he refused to work with me or even accept that it was possible that he or his employees broke it. So fit $100 part he has lost my business. I was asking him for a full detail prior to this happening which would have easily made the $100 back from me. I just don't get businesses these days. Never going back and I recommend going elsewhere to any who are curious. I use to go here all the time because I think they do the best job in town.</Text>< UserId.>

Best hand carwash in the Bay Area! You can tell how much work they put in to each car by how clean it is. I’ve been coming here for years and they haven’t let me down yet. If you want the best for your car, then I highly recommend this place!< /review>

< Review>
I came here with a coupon from the website which knocked a few dollars off the price of a full wash.  They did an OK job on the inside of my car.  On the outside, it sure looked like they were trying to get the car clean, I can't fault them for effort.  But they missed several spots and the brushes they used caused micro-scratches that will need to be polished out.  But those are the good things, my car is a manual transmission and they burned the hell out of the clutch driving it slowly through the process.  It smelled like clutch in the car for a full day.  I can only imagine how many thousands of miles worth of wear they caused to the clutch on my car driving it less than 100 feet.< /Review>

BEST!!! I MEAN THE BEST CARWASH AROUND.They are awesome and they really take care of your car. They are so nice and friendly and have a nice waiting room, it makes me so comfortable being there because the carwash is nice and customers  are nice and the employees are very friendly. Something great about this place is that the owner and his family is always there and they make sure your car goes looking good.

This location by far the best of all of JB vendor locations in SoCal. I live minutes from the DTLA locations, but prefer to come to this location instead... T Swizz & other staff including security are super polite, curbside pickup system is organized (and nice to have), and location itself is always in great shape.</review>

<Review>The weed they offer here are so high in quality its hard to pick a favorite. The only thing that's not letting me put 5 stars is that the weed Is quite expensive, but you're paying for quality which they have.< /Review>< Resp>

I always like to call a dispensary before I go because most places always rush you around. Face to face interaction is premium, so making sure you have someone that wants people to visit is a plus. I was able to ask Ashely questions, and she took the time to answer me and even give additional information. Her customer service was excellent, and I'm excited to visit.<//Review>

Pacing of the line, check-in, menu explanation could be better but these are trying times.

Overall it was a pleasant experience. The interior was, "a clean, well-lighted place," that made me feel welcome. The displays were engaging and informative, as were the bud-tenders. I'll be heading back, although I'd prefer a more thorough explanation of the, "tiers," and a way to feel less like I'm being bounced around the store while I look at various strains, on my next visit.

Don't forget your rec!</review>

Clean but overpriced. There are better, cheaper places to get quality weed. Anyone who says its the best in OC doesn't know weed or is working for them<//review>

<review>Very good strains and the prices are good as well.
If you can't afford it, don't do it... ALL TOP shelf.
I'll do business again.

Been in the flower game for 35 years. A friend turned me on to this place when they opened their OC store. Hands down my favorite flower. I have not touched anything else since. Quality stuff for a fair price. #Hippycrashers. 🤘🤘< /review>

<Gmap_id>0x80dc072c61bd4423:0x5b80b0590b6d67f6</Gmap_id><Text>It was a good dining experience and food was quite good (loved the Mac n cheese, steak and fresh bread as well as the fish).  Ambience is nice too.  We got seated inside which is good too but seems the outdoor dining ambience is even better especially in the evening.  Only negative to report is that service was not top friendly at least at the table (reception very friendly).  No one checked much on us or if we needed a soda refill through the whole dinner.  Maybe an off night but given the tier it felt service was missing the mark.  Still would recommend highly and would give it another shot for sure.< /Text><rating>4</rating><resp>None</resp><name>Kashan Piracha<//name>< user>

<text>Love place is such a gem!!
We had a party of 13 and was our server she was so knowledgeable, patient, and enthusiastic, she was just simply fantastic!
The manager Richard was also so delightful he came to our table a few time to check on us. All in all the service was top notch! The cocktail was delicious and the was okay. The place is huge which make social distancing easy but can accommodate big a party.
Ask for Tia if she is available! She'll make your experience that much more fun!<//text></record></dataset><record>

Lovely atmosphere and good drinks. The roast lamb was cooked well though slightly over-seasoned for my taste, with a sort of mint topping across the outer layer. Could have been more subtle, but it was good overall. Wine pairing was wonderful and enjoyed our cocktails. Would definitely go back.

I can say that place was real nice but thats kind of brought down by average mall goers walking in with flip flops and gym clothes. I'm not saying that's bad, I just assumed by the pricing of the food this would be a higher standard type deal. The pricing doesn't match the ambience but no biggie, just saying.

I had a couple issues with my food. I would say my steak was under seasoned but honestly I just don't think it was seasoned at all. After adding salt on my own to it I somewhat saved it. They had no steak sauce, I just feel like if there is steak there should be steak sauce. And the mashed potatoes were pasty in texture. The only thing I really liked was the old fashion I got, but thats a standard drink.

Overall not worth the bill we paid for dinner.< /Text>

Not a wine drinker but the white wines are pretty tasty and it's a full bar so they have other stuff to drinks as well. Staff was super nice and social. 10 out of 10 will go again.<//Text>

<text>My husband and I left my credit card there. I called the next day and they confirmed they had it. We showed up during dinner time which was busy but the lady was unable to help us and give back my card. We asked her multiple times and she said we had to wait for another hour or so until things slowed down. We were frustrated and after waiting 15-20 mins we left without my card! I had to again come back to next day to try and pick it up again! I am extremely frustrated!

We will not be returning which is unfortunate because we did enjoy this place and the lobster was divine. We were neglected as customers as others were assisted before us as we stood there. Once I returned the next day it took less than a minute for my card to be retrieved from the safe. I am disappointed with how the situation was handled poorly.< /text>< pictures>

Beautiful restaurant with a fantastic wine selection and a modern ambiance. We like dining by the shimmering blue quartz-stone bar as its fun and lively. Formal, sit-down dining is also available. Food is excellent with abundant flavor. Good vegetarian selections. Staff is very friendly and helpful.< /Review>

This place seems to always be slammed, and rightfully so. Getting a seat might be tough during prime lunch/dinner hours, but it's worth it. The food was quite good. My only complaint is that some of the tables are very snug, so you may be sitting close to strangers. Other than that, it was a good experience.< /review>

The food and service is okay. I enjoyed the pork lollipops and I've also had the braised ShortRib and that too was tender and good flavor.

I love the decor in the restaurant.  The only negative was the bar next door. The service there sucked.

My last visit to the restaurant bar was much better.</Review>

Very nice restaurant. I like the style and the set up. Appetizers were good. Has a nice outdoor spot too. Service was good until we asked if we could move outside. Apparently they had to change the menus and would not accommodate what we already wanted from the other menu.<//Text>

The Winery has become one of my favorite restaurants! Each time I visit, I try something new, and I'm amazed. The name gives it away, so the wine selection is awesome, of course. The staff is very knowledgeable of the wines and can guide to a choice for appropriate pairing. As for the food.. it's incredible! The steaks are grass fed beef and always cooked exactly how you ask for it. But my favorite go to is the risotto! You can't find a better risotto anywhere else.<//Text>

The Winery Restaurant is a culinary delight and delivers exceptional cuisine in a chic and gorgeous setting. The Angus Beef Short Rib with bacon-wrapped asparagus and couscous is extraordinary, and the warm Almond Crumble Vanilla Bean Ice Cream atop peaches and berries is not to be missed! Top the whole dining experience off with "The Boyz" wine, a bountiful aromatic house blend. The Winery Restaurant delights in every way.< /review>

We went here because of the line in another place, found a very professional team of waiters and waitresses. We were in a cocktail mood, we were very surprised by the quality of the cocktails for a wine place. Nice outside patio with fireplaces. The food was of good quality too!
Check it out during happy hours, it's worth it!I< /Review>

What a nice place to hang out they have indoor and an outdoor bar with this amazing blue geode top.
Vince the bartender was friendly and got our wine spritzers just right.
Nice mixture of shade and son the temperature was just right!
Decent prices for wine and beer.  Good place to come by when shopping in the area.<//text>

Had wedding meal here private room 13 of my closest people we enjoyed the fine cheese and smoked meat starters the spicy mustard was awesome. My heirloom tomato salad with the special mozzarella was so good and elevated by the specialty salt infused with saffron, citrus, herbs,  and original. Put on side. My wife jumbo scallops and shrimp perfectly cooked my fillet melted in my mouth and that was in full agreement with the table. You know what's next beautiful chocolate torte so rich one bite felt like ten bite so flavorful.  Our waiter , and if I get this wrong I'm sorry, Michael was great informative and engaging  without being intrusive.  I will be returning and telling friends triple A+<//text>

Delightful place in La Jolla. The staff were kind enough to seat a party of 8 without a reservation. The appetizers were delightful; I highly recommend the mushroom flat bread. They have seasonal specials for main course - you should definitely try them. And they have a great selection of good wine; the magnum bottles are ideal for large parties. Don't forget to try their Dark Chocolate Marquis; it is divine. Their service is top notch and they do their best to accommodate particular dietary choices.</text>

<Review>We went here with some friends based on their recommendation and we were not disappointed.

The food and wine at the Winery were simply just great. Each dish we tried was amazing and the Fois gras was on point.

It’s a great place to check out if you’re in the La Jolla area for a date night or a night out with friends.< /Review>< Pics>

< review>
First impression when I walked in is that this was a very well run restaurant. The hostess was just so sweet. Our waiter was very charming and just felt like everyone there made an extra effort to make us comfortable.

I am an Agent in San Fernando with Farmers Insurnace and I had taken my father to the Farmers Insurance Open at Torry Pines. Their hospitality was so appreciated after our long day of walking around the golf course 😊

Food was stellar.

For our appetizer we started with a Selection of Fresh Seasonal Oysters with horse radish and 3 sauces. Perfect light weight starter and tasted delish.

Second we tried their most popular appetizer which was their Crispy Kurobuta Pork Belly Lollipops. They were full of flavor and defiantly our favorite.

For dinner I had their 18oz Bone-In Rib Eye Steak which was juicy, flavorful and filling. If you like steak this is the one to go with.

My Father had the Slow Braised Angus Beef Short-rib he loved.

Ambience was very relaxed, comfortable and Luxurious.<//review>

<Review>Wow,  this place was great.  Service on point. Most of the food was amazing. Presentation was gorgeous. We ordered the 45 oz tomahawk steak, seafood tower, chilean seabass special of the night, lobster on mushroom risotto special of the night, the scallops and shrimp on risotto, brussel sprouts wity bacon and ended it off with creme brulee and vanilla ice cream and sorbet. It was quite a lot of food, enough to serve 6 hungry people. The steak was well seasoned and cooked perfectly to medium rare. Well worth the $140! The seafood tower was good, but a little on the fishy side. The presentation was beautiful, but I can say ive had better. To me, not worth the $119 for the item. All the other stuff...delicious!</Review>< pics>

The space itself is large, with an alcove once you walk in, and a cavernous subterranean area that can fit at least half a dozen parties at once. Indeed, the entire place can be booked up by different parties on any given weekday.</Review>

The only reason we are giving this two stars instead of one is the scallop and shrimp dinner was very tasty. We had a reservation and had to wait 10 minutes past our reservation time to get a table. We were greeted by the server and asked for our drink order basically when we sat down and received the drink menu. Then had to wait an extended period of time for him to come back to take our drink orders. That was the theme for the rest of dinner. Hurry up and wait for the waiter to come back for everything.
We asked what the market fish was for the day and the only words I understood for what it was was “halibut.”
We ordered that and the scallops and an appetizer.
We then had to ask someone to bring us complimentary bread while we waited because it took us so long to get our order taken we were starving at that point.
The food came out and the halibut was super over cooked.
I have been in the service industry for many years but we spent over $150 on dinner and 1 drink at this place and have not been that disappointed in the money we spent in a really long time.
I am really irritated that I spent almost $50 for my plate alone and it was not cooked well.
I had super high hopes for the restaurant because of the menu and was pretty disappointed.
I don’t usually write reviews if it was bad because I don’t like to hurt business reputations but I felt it was warranted this time as I was extremely unimpressed and angry that I had to spend so much money for it.
My recommendation if you decide to eat here is sit at the bar and eat the scallops for dinner. Then maybe you won’t be disappointed.< /Text>

Num num num. Do not leave this place until you've tried their mussels!! Yummmm. Romantic & chic outdoors. Definitely try it out if you're in the valley. Sometimes there's a long wait if you go during dinner rush hour...so keep that in mind...< /review>

Nice menu, great service, delicious food. The happy hour collection is very tasty and it includes a good selection of options for drinks and food. The dinner menu has a great mix. For longer dinner, please ask for the wine menu, but for quicker menu the on the glass menu is quite good including the house wines.<//Text>

This place was beautiful and the staff was very kind at first. My husband and I sat to eat to kill time while waiting for his apple products to be ready for pickup. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and he had the mahi mahi tacos. I expressed that I felt my grilled chicken was not cooked probably and the server said it was fine. My husband ate the rest of the sandwich and later that evening we both had violent food poisoning. Extremely disappointed that such a nice restaurant does not know how to cook their food properly.<//Text>

<Name>7 Trumpets<//Name><Text>We went to the Winery soon after it opened and think the atmosphere is wonderful and the staff super friendly. It’s a great place to sit indoors or outdoors. They have two different indoor sections between the outdoor area depending on what kind of atmosphere you’re in the mood for.  We enjoyed the happy hour snacks, view and of course the wine. We will definitely go back soon. This mall has remodeled almost everything and is a super nice place to go now. We went to the La Jolla UTC location.<//Text><Date>1524876583573<//Date>< GmapID>

This place is great.  It has a classy and elegant feel but you dont have to dress up fancy to go.  The staff is wonderful and very friendly.  Food was incredible and very delicious.  Great wine, ofcourse too!
A great place to hang with friends and just relax and have a good time.  It is a little pricy but 100% worth it.  I will be back for another "friends night out" for sure.< /text>

She told us it would be just a moment while they set the table, after a few minutes of waiting another couple showed up. Another hostess asked them if they had a reservation to which they responded no . She then asked about a seating preference to which they said none, the hostess responds great and proceeds to seat them immediately.  We left immediately and won't be back, perhaps if we were 6 feet tall and looked like models we would have been seated immediately.   F' this place so disrespectful.<//text>< pics>

We took a small group of customers to lunch here today.  It was a disaster.  First drink orders were jumbled. Then it took 75 minutes for entrees to start arriving and another 15 to serve everyone.  (because "someone ordered a steak and that takes a long time to cook"  ---  honestly that was the explanation!)  2 orders never arrived and had to be done again, the rest were delivered to the wrong people.

Not so friendly staff and it took over 5 minutes to be greeted at the bar (even though we sat DIRECTLY in front of two bartenders and the barback). Also, apparently this place must have an ice crisis because there is a $2 charge (that they don't tell you about) for having a drink on the rocks. I wouldn't go back.< /review>

OHMYGODDESS...Phenomenal experience enhanced by the service of the staff here!! We were greeted and helped with our stroller and numerous shopping bags by Cassandra ... this most warm and absolutely delightful young woman went Above and Beyond assisting us ... no easy feat,  3 women,  1 baby and an exhausted papa!!  Our waiter,  Jaz ... was GREAT ~ was so very accommodating ... explaining every answer to each question enabling papa to make the healthiest choices for his keto diet.   The food was incredible ... we had everything from filet mignon to Kobe beef burger to poke tuna salad to tomahawk pork chop,  the food absolutely delicious and then some, the flavors,  the fusion ... WOW!!  WE LOVE THIS PLACE ... and will absolutely make it a destination eatery with plans to bring out of town guests!!  Always wonderful to find a new place .. that far exceeds your expectations and makes the ending to a fun day ... not only delicious,  absolutely Perfect!!  Highly,  highly recommended!!< /Text>

Only been there for dessert and wine but so far service and food were exceptional. The creme brulee was amazing and I loved that we got to talk to the sommelier! If our experience so far is any indication of a dining experience there I have no doubt I'll be frequenting their establishment quite often!< /Review>

< Review>
A group of us ate here last night. So, let me start with the positives. The service I thought was really good. They seemed attentive and professional. The appetizers were good, we had the pork belly lollipops, and the foie gras (which was a special that night). Both were pretty good. My wife and I split the BOB salad, which I enjoyed.
The main course is where things went off the rails.  Overall the pace of the meal seemed kind of slow, but it seemed to take extra long to get the main dishes out. There were 6 of us, and 2 ordered the halibut special, and the rest ordered steak. There was a filet, two NY’s and the flat iron. Of the 4 steaks, only the flat iron came out warm. All the others came out cold. My in particular, which was one of the NY steaks, came out cold and undercooked, like way undercooked.  I ordered med-rare, and I got something that was undercooked for rare even. For sides we got the Mac and cheese, herb fries, and asparagus. Fries are in a cone, which makes it tough for sharing, Mac and cheese had a big blob of cheese melted on top, and was not very good.

We finally mentioned something towards the end, and the waiter tried to make things right by comping some deserts and appetizers.

With tip, we spent $250 a couple on that meal, which was painful for me, because I didn’t enjoy it.  Then to make matters worse, a few hours later, I got sick. I know I should have said something to the staff, but I don’t like to complain.

Bottom line, half the people enjoyed their dishes and the other half thought things were sub par. Frankly, I probably would have given 3 stars before I got sick, that put me off of this place forever. So my advice, eat here at your own risk.</Review>

<username>Jack Lee</username><Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>Just ate there, my friend highly recommended the flat iron steak which he said it was sizzling and tasty on his first time. Day 2 was not so fortunate. The flat iron steak came cold and immediate turn off for me. We were considering returning it, but I usually don't complain to the waiter, since it was the chef's fault. The lollypop pork belly was good but I still prefer it salty instead of sweet-ish. The Ahi tuna poke had no spark, I remember Love Boat Sushi at fashion valley being much better. Fries in a cone is good for a bar, not sure it works on a restaurant since other people might not be as comfortable to share and put your hand inside. I had the Cioppino and again not rich in flavor as Civico restaurant in Little Italy (not even close actually). That's it!< /text>< response>

I've made a mental note to try The Winery at UTC and finally got the chance to go. We didn't make any reservations and were not aware that we were supposed to on a Saturday evening so we didn't get a seat in the actual restaurant. However, there were open seating at the Winery Bar which was where we went. The bar had it's own patio and offered the same menu as the restaurant. We ordered a charcuterie board - variety of cheese, fruits, spreads, and meat. I only had one glass of Pinot Noir and a friend had a blood orange Bellini. Bellini was pretty refreshing. And my pinot was perfect for our charcuterie.

What made me like this place was probable the atmosphere. It was a little more on the casual side compared to the actual dine in restaurant. There were nice seats inside the bar, but we opted for the outside patio because it was just too perfect to be indoor. It was the evening and the lights on the trees made the place feel like I wasn't even at the mall anymore. UTC really turned itself around! Anyways, I had a great time and will definitely be back to the Winery Bar.

The waitress was nice and offered to get us more fruits from our board.< /text>

<Time>1519680441781< /Time><Rate>1</Rate><Text>Honest truth. This place is TERRIBLE. And it cost us $180. Don’t make the same mistake as us.

To express how bad my experience was here I literally created an a gmail email account to do this. I CANNOT warn you enough. This place is NO GOOD. The service was terrible! Beyond bad. Slow. And inconsistent. Example, half the tables had bread. Other half didn’t. I don’t believe our server knew they gave out bread.. Anyhow, this is an upscale restaurant (prices and all) so you literally have these dedicated service professionals standing and talking with each other rather than working. Even the managers. Wife and I ordered two dishes: fish and venison. The fish came out cold. Like it was still somewhat frozen. Uncooked. The venison was way over flavored. But I didn’t share that. We only conveyed that the first was still cold. And they replaced it. But then never came back again! Not once. Not how is it now. Nothing. At the end we called over a busser to get our check. It came back, paid our bill, even left a tip (stupid me).. But I forgot my credit card. I then called back the next day. I talked to Patrick, the bar manager, who seemed annoyed. He then put us on hold and after 14 minutes we eventually hung up and called back. 100% honest here. He told us he had other things he was dealing with but checked and he didn’t have it.. Like he had time to check but not to let us know.. We believe he has our credit card. We called back the next day and spoke with Jennifer, some other manager, who also seemed annoyed. We explained our situation and asked for the GMs name. She refused to give it to us! She said she’d relay the message. After a day we still haven’t heard back so we called in and asked Kaitlyn, the hostess and she gave us the GMs name: Greg Elmowitz (sp?). FML, avoid this place!<//Text>< Pics>

My favorite supplier, the owner Jacob the temani😉 is a special one of kind person. We need more people like him in this world. They have the best prices, the J&S team both in the front and in the back office are professional and really nice people, I appreciate them all and will be a customer of theirs for many more years to come!<//Text>

I have been here three times only and iam very disappointed ,the service is very poor ,the three single times I went there I had to wait a long time for been helped;there is a tall guy with the beard that is always busy he looks overcharged!!while there is another guy who is always with a girl in the isles even when they see that there is a bunch of people waiting and do not take care of the customers this happened to me every single time I went there,and I am not coming back.
Somebody has to do something about it or gonna lose customers .
Thank you Mike for telling me about this place but I deserve a little respect as a customer.</Text>

<Review>We came hee for their xiao long boa aka soup dumplings.   The dumplings broke when trying to take them off the stream tray.  That's a big no no as the whole point is to get the soup first when eating the dumplings.   All the dishes where ok, but everything was in the pricy side.   No rice came with the dishes so you pay extra for that too. Service wasn't good and we were asked to pay before we finished eating so they could do their lunch tally.<//Review><Date>1512287036871<//Date><UserId.>111414489430298948350</UserId.>< rating>

Xiao long baos were really good! The spicy wontons were very good too
The dish that resembles “Cantonese chow mein” (#167), I found too sweet.</Review>

< Review>
This is a great spot if you have a short amount of time and you want some quality Shanghai food. Their dumplings are fair portions and made really well. It is very good but be cautious when biting into one because some of them are so juicy you could potentially get soup all over yourself. The service is fast and efficient and the staff is friendly. Parking can be tough so come early or come prepared.<//Review>

Food was amazing, service was #&#+ awful! Easily five stars if they weren't so terrible.

They tried to charge us twice for one of our dishes and were straight up angry with us when we *gently* pointed out the error. Not going back, despite the amazing dumplings.<//review>

Calzones are big and delicious....food is a little slow, but tastes good.  Not a fancy place...mostly a sports bar with a pool table in back room. It could get very noisy if restaurant is full.</Review>

I've lived in this area all my life and I only wish I came here sooner. Their xiaolongbao is made fresh and not frozen, tastes amazing with plenty of soup. It is also cheaper than most other stores. I only know a few places with non-frozen xiaolongbao and they are far or expensive, except for this place. Their sheng jian bao was also pretty good, but I wish there was more soup in them. The wonton soup was also one of the best i've had.<//review>

Legit tasty baos at very reasonable prices. Not as much in the way of fresh vegetables, so meals/snacks tend toward the heavy.</review>

<review>The Xiao Long Bao's here live up to the restaurant's name. We have been coming here for years and the consistency is spot on.
They're always filled with a good amount of soup and the dough is just the right thickness, so they don't break open when picking them up. Closed on Tuesdays.</review>< Pictures>

<text>Used to come here often for lunch when worked around the area but not anymore so wanted to visit on the way driving from SF. Easy off highway, easy street parking. My first xiao long bao was here maybe 6ish years ago, so it's kind of a favorite for that. They are pretty good xiao long bao. Also like the bean curd sheet with pork, the beef with shitakes, hmm I can't think of the proper names of the dishes.... But good, you can order by photo for some tasty items.< /text>< Pictures>

You can't go to a place called Xiao Long Bao Kitchen and not order the aforementioned dish, so of course I had the xiao long bao along with the Shanghai boiled dumplings with shrimp. The XLB were juicy and all in tact, but the pork and soup inside lacked some flavor. The complementing vinegar sauce was delicious, with pieces of shredded ginger. The boiled pork and shrimp dumplings were large, but as with the XLBs, lacked some flavor. The accompanying sauce had a red tint to it, which made me think it was spicy, but I was pleasantly surprised. The sauce was without spice and delicious with the boiled dumplings. As with other traditional Chinese places, you can expect complementary tea with the meal, which was pretty affordable. $8 for 8 XLBs or 10 boiled dumplings!

This place was okay, but my top choice for dumplings in SSF will still be Dumpling Empire. Gave this place a try because Dumpling Empire is closed on Wednesdays and Kingdom of Dumpling in the Sunset seemed too far for my dumpling cravings.< /review>

< review>
(Translated by Google) For Latinos, the service does not work, because what you have left over you have to put in the boxes. And the waitress has to call her asta to pay. And the place did not have many people. The tables of the other Chinese customers with white tablecloths. And cloth napkins. And to us a paper napkin ... I will never return. ..

(Original)
Para los latinos no sirve el servicio.pues lo que sobra uno lo tiene que poner en las cajitas.y la mesera tienes que llamarla asta para pagar.y el lugar ni tenia muchagenten.las mesas de los demas clientes chinos con mantel blanco. Y servilletss de tela.y a nosotros una servilleta de papel..jamas vuelvo. ..</review>

The Recycling Center is ripping off people.

I returned 320 small bottles and 15 large bottles. Instead of 17,5$ I just got 11$. That’s 64,71% of the money.

They weighted the bottles. The scale showed -8,5 pounds before the container (where the bottles were put in) was put on. I doubt that empty containers weight 8,5 pounds.

Homeless people and other people, who need money, are collecting many bottles… just to get ripped of by this recycling centre.</text>

These guys were friendly and awesome! They have decent hours, the ground isn't sticky. The only thing I didn't like was there was no way to wash my hands, but whatever. They even helped me sort everything out. I'm coming here from now on :)< /review>

Very wide open space to get your RV through. It is a little convoluted getting back to the station in contrast to the large number if lanes and open space.  Prices were inline with the area. Was not crowded but that could be due to COVID -19.</text>

<Text>Twice they have tried to charge 100$ for gas that was wasn't pumped on my debit card, but it was instantly declined. I gave them a second chance but that was a mistake I won't make a third time. Over priced gas and thieves trying to steal your money.< /Text><user_id>106661145566297419190< /user_id>< Response>

Decent sized station with food and drinks inside, although the cups for beverages were missing so I couldn't get soda.</Review>

Great location. Love the hand sanitizer at the pumps. But that’s about it. Has ok prices for gas. Customer service has been ok. No beer or wine??? It sucks. I would totally buy some there all the time.<//text>

The guy behind the counter was quite rude. I stopped in because my tire was low, asked the gentleman if he would turn the air on, went back to my car and it never came on. I went back in, asked again and waited about 3 more min before he finally turned it on. I could see if the place was busy but there was only one other customer there and he was outside. I'll go elsewhere for air in the future!<//review>

<Review>I visit this gas station once a week, usually on Tuesdays. I like most of the service, but pump #4 does not give a receipt. Why is that? I have mentioned it to the attendant every time I fill up, and he says he has notified the office. Nothing has been done regarding getting a receipt. Please can someone get this attended to. Thank you!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>Our server, John, was very attentive and gave us a lot of ideas for how to spend the rest of our stay. Next time, I might come back. If you arrive in the afternoon, remember to bring a hat because the sun is high in the sky. Around 4 p.m., I recommend taking in the sunset and the city's night view.<//text>< Resp>

<Text>I went on a Thursday after work during happy hour and I looked it a lot. The bar is clean and stocked with craft beers and a decent liquor selection. The staff and regulars were friendly. We had some wounds which hit the spot, we were only sad that they ran out of pretzels when we went. Unfortunately I couldn't stay for Karaoke on this day but I have been in the past before it got remodeled about 2 years ago and it was super fun.</Text>< Response>

One of my favorite Karaoke Bars in West LA, for sure. Unfortunately, do to Covid-19 there won't be Karaoke for a while. However, they do have outdoor seating available right now. I still enjoying going there because their entire staff is so friendly, prices are right, and the their food is so good! I have been going there for over 5 years and I honestly have nothing to complain about. If you're going to check out BW 11 (the local nickname) for the first time, keep in mind that you may need some patience to find parking if you're not going to take a Lyft or Uber. They are in a little corner plaza so the parking can be very limited from time to time. Lately because of the pandemic, it's been very easy to find parking.

Side note: When they do open back up to full capacity, you'll want to get there early to put you name on the list to sing, that place gets packed! Lol</Text>

Place has always been amazing. Haven't been here in two years... and still one of best places I've eaten. Prices are a little tiny bit more then your avg sushi place, but not loaded with rice. Plenty of fish which is what we come for! Double yellow tail is amazing, uni with quail egg is amazing and hand rolls are amazing once again not overloaded with rice. If you get salmon skin you get plenty, if you get scallops you get plenty. Worth the price, hospitality is amazing, and place is always clean...</Text>

<text>First time  definitely not my last!
From the food, to the atmosphere, to the service-I have only compliments and no complaints!
Our server Jen was very kind, helpful, and attentive.
The home made pastas are divine!
And the PEACH SALAD IS MY FAV THING EVER!

Highly recommend this place :)</text>< rating>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>Every glowing word of praise preceding my review was also my experience. My husband and I and another couple raved about every aspect of the evening the entire ride home. I'm trying to think when the last time was that happened. We cannot wait to go back and finish trying everything on the menu and to see some live music. We were amazed how we could hear each other and the music perfectly but not one conversation happening around us. The decor, the food, the wine, the service were all simply perfect. Do yourself a favor and go family style - share as many different dishes as you can. Each one marvels and lingers. Bravo!!!!</text>< userid>

Their rolls were delicious and the garlic edamame was so saucy & flavorful. The staff was wonderful and made sure we were doing okay. We went during lunch hour so the parking wasn't too bad. I'm not sure how the parking is  during dinner time. It's a small parking lot. I think I might have found my go to sushi spot in LC!

But there is one bar to go to that it feels like home, and I could spend all day.... and it's the Shamrock.  The people are always awesome... it is very much a community bar.  The place is quaint with lots of random, assorted seating.... but here is why it is one of the best in the city:<//Review>

Hands down the best service I've ever received at a bar. I was sick with the cold and asked for hot water. In no time I was handed a cute mason jar glass with hot water, freshly squeezed lemon, and some agave to sweeten it up. I was beyond grateful and even when I was half way done I was offered a refill. I know I may be biased but I'm sure their alcoholic drinks are just as good :)</text>

Boardwalk 11 GASTROPUB and Karaoke ever been a very loyal place for 20+ years of special events and intimate dining with my family they have places that you would never see in any other restaurant where every dining experience is different from the last especially their wine room which is only one table but you cannot be any more intimate than that special spot the bar and the bartenders and the staff are the best and I travel a lot... Looking for some Prime rib, New York steak ,and our favorite Molly salad prawn cocktail and fish and chips...This place nestled in the foothills aren't going away ,first bite you'll know what I mean ,thank you for listening</Text>

<response>None< /response><review>Best place to ring in a Friday night. I love the cozy, casual vibe of this bar. It's also conveniently located in the Montrose shopping lane so there is plenty of parking (huge free lot in the back). I absolutely love the food here. I've tried probably everything on the menu and have loved it all. My favorites are the sausage platter, the burger (with bacon and guacamole added), the bacon wrapped hot dog, and the bacon mac n cheese (clearly I love bacon lol). There are always a bunch of beer options and a ton of delicious cocktails. I also love that there are TVs everywhere and they show all the football games on Sundays! There is always some sporting event playing which is just perfect for me. It gets very packed on Friday nights but it's the perfect place to have that first drink of the weekend.< /review><userid>102015904449506742341</userid><pics>None< /pics><Gmap_id>0x80c2bbcb99c2200f:0xd87a5214846753a3< /Gmap_id><name>Nolan Brandel</name>< Time>

Love this place. Upstairs/downstairs. I believe it's a Boardwalk 11 GASTROPUB and Karaoke? But bartenders are all Irish. Super good service. Trivia night (which I don't attend), good atmosphere for Football games on TV, and within stones throw of 4 other bars. Food seems to be mediocre at best. But I don't think it's a destination for grub, just helps keep you there. 4 stars for sure though.<//Review>

Friendly bar staff and solid competition on the dart boards here. Ive competed professionally for years and I gotta say I am impressed with the talent. Very cool studio city crowd. A little on the divey sidr, which is a breath of fresh air in LA. Very nice and cozy inside.</Review>

Great speakeasy that is an awesome spot for whiskey drinkers and cocktail connoisseurs at a reasonable price. Most affordable place to get Macallan 12 if you're into scotch - also, it is definitely a fun, diverse karaoke spot if you're drunk enough. Ample seating provided in the backroom that is fantastic when you're just looking to chill out after work. Food is surprisingly tasty and above average for an upscale dive bar.<//review>

< Review>
Boardwalk 11:

My husband and I were looking for a venue that offers fun, food and a good space to entertain our friends and family for an evening to celebrate his retirement and my birthday.

As usual, we went online, did a search for those types of TAGS and came across Boardwalk 11.

We looked at most of the 500+ reviews already posted, including the negative ones. Some of those are really serious: Cold old food, roaches, bad service, etc.

Most people may have been persuaded to not even consider this place, but we thought: Can it really be THAT BAD?

The answer is NO! – We went the same day we did our research, parked in the parking lot (which is free valet [translation: If you eat or drink, incl. non-alcoholic drinks you only need to consider tipping the valet]), went inside and we started to look around.

The place was almost empty, but it was just a little after 6:30 PM on a Tuesday. There was a clear friendliness between patrons, bartender, server and newcomers like us.

We sat down near the bar, got a menu and were surprised about the prices as those are pretty competitive to other places.

Even though we felt “adventurous”, both of us ended up with the same dish: BBQ Chicken Tostada Salad. The shell was crispy, the salad fresh and the chicken tender. – It was good.

Still, having some of those negative reviews in mind, I kept looking for anything that would gross me out. I didn’t see anything. No Roaches, no bugs of any kind. In fact, the entire place was clean, inviting, and fun.

Our server also managed to bring the owner over to us. Which was nice, as I kept thinking about the negative review he got and I expected to meet a grumpy, old, unkempt, mean, horrid person. He is not.

Steve introduced himself and started chatting with us about the venue. He is open minded, courteous, and funny.

Even though things may change in the future, but for right now, and based on our first impression, we are looking forward to our little celebration at Boardwalk 11.<//Review>

I am so disappointed in this place. I came here because of the show and it went all down hill. Display and everything was great and the music but the food has gone downhill. I seen roaches crawling and I feel like it just got more terrible over time. The most horrific experience happened when I found a small bug in my food. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!<//review>

It's telling when you make your way to the same bar two times in one week! And by this I mean The Know Where Bar is the place to be!

They have solid daily drink specials and have tapas/cheese boards at hand. The bartenders are fast and friendly with service and it never seems to get obnoxiously over-crowded.

Bonus: not overpriced like neighboring bars.< /review>

The food was good a bit pricey but good 👌. I ordered chicken wings, a side of fries and a Sprite. My bill was $20! I didn't even get a drink yet lol. I was hoping that all the menu items wasn't itemized but it's not a big deal. The staff is awesome.
When it comes to the Karaoke part it was cool.  The DJ needed to play a better mix of songs in between the participants.  Other than that I had fun. Nice crowd of people. Whether you sang the house down or sucked you were welcomed.</Review>

Well let's start this review off, positively. The bar is doing just fine. The food is amazing. Guys are you serious? Reality T.V shows like hell and back are all staged, I was there when they were filming, it's all staged. Have you guys forgot that? Gordan does this to make money, he doesn't care about the owners, he works with thousands with them, thats too much to care about for him. The food is made there on the spot. Their burgers are the best I've ever tasted, better than In and Out, and that's a really bold statement that I wouldn't be making if I didn't believe in it.

I don't work for them, I wasn't paid by them, hell I could care less if they did all the bad things that Gordan's team staged, but they don't do the things, so it pisses me off to the bone to see random people who never stepped foot in the bar to give it a 1 star review and say all these rude and hateful things. Remember how we were taught to never judge a book by it's cover huh? Well, you're doing it here, knock it off guys< /Text>

Very, very cool place.  We had a very dear co-worker's retirement party there, and from the moment I valet parked (tip when you leave) to the time we left it was 5-stars.  D.J Karaoke Guy was PHENOMENAL and food super yummy.  Will absolutely go back.</Text>

If you love karokee this is the place. Karokee everyday. The best thing about this bar was the service. My bartender/ server/ rockstar made my experience here memorable. She knew about everything. The drinks, the food, the best songs to sing, the traffic, thank you endlessly Myla you are their biggest asset.</review>

This place is horrible. Food was nasty and tasted old. Wish I could give 0 stars. My husband got food poisoning. The owner is the lowest of low humans. Has no respect. Doesn't do anything but act like a jerk. Save yourself and NEVER even think about going. You can karaoke somewhere way better I promise.</review>

Food tasted rotten and cold. Staff is okay but the manager is completely awful and can’t run a business. Lots of better restaurants and bars in the area, so skip this one.< /Text>

A great place to go for kareoke, by yourself or with a group. They have food, I like their tomato soup and grilled cheese meal. My favorite thing about them is their draft beer selection. L< /text>

Came here about two months ago, the drinks were good the staff seem disconnected. The food was mediocre at best. The restaurant was dirty and I'm afraid to see what the kitchen looks like. I didn't realize that this was on a Gordon Ramsay show which now makes it more of a disappointment< /text>

Great for big groups, decent staff, no cover charge, reasonably priced food and drinks. Came for Karaoke was a very fun night but long wait to get on the song list. Recommend the French fries but that’s it. Ordered the wings, it was obviously microwaved but poorly done, as they were hot on the outside and frozen once we bit into it.
Overall:
3 for food
5 for drinks
4 for Karaoke<//Text>

I've walked past this place like a million times but never went in until just recently.  Imagine my surprise when I saw how clean, intimate and classy the establishment was.  It's a perfect place to bring a date or a small group of friends for local craft beer, good food and watching people sing their favorite karaoke songs.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant-bar to others and would come back again.  I knocked off a star due to it's utter lack of parking.  However, for those who happen to live in the area, it is the quintessential neighborhood bar experience and would encourage others in the Palms area to check it out.  A perfect venue for a date.</Review>

Most of the VJs are pretty good... the one last night kept putting other people in front of us... overall the staff is friendly, and the crowd is pretty good.  There are some pretty good singers here.  But, people please choose appropriate songs...You have you choose songs that the crowd will enjoy.   Just because you like  singing show tunes from The Little Mermaid in your shower does not mean it's a good karaoke song...</review>

I went here to enjoy a karaoke night with a new friend and got a table near the karaoke host and close to the stage. The place itself was nice enough. Lots of comfortable seating. Good sound system. Nice branded stage with good lighting. They had a charging station but I ended up grabbing an outlet closer to my table to charge my phone.

It was St. Patrick's Day so my friend and I both ordered green beers which were featured on the menu. Basically they were green versions of Miller Light which worked for us.

We both put songs in with the karaoke host immediately upon arrival and settled in at our table to look through the karaoke book with our green beers. It was posted that we could only put one song in at a time so that's what we did. I was told the wait to sing was about an hour and a half. Not being terribly long we patiently waited our turns while being entertained by the other performers.

Two and a half hours and four beers later my friend and I had still not been invited up to sing yet and I would soon have to head home to get some sleep for work the next day so I asked the karaoke host again if he could work us into the lineup soon. He said we were 7 songs away.  That would be another half an hour! 3 hours wait to sing one song??!! Which would have been twice his original estimate of one and a half hours. That was ridiculous and not ok.

Now mind you I watched certain performers get up there 2 or three times throughout the night while we waited to sing once. I am certain that the karaoke hosts math was not off when he gave the earlier time estimate but seemed to not value our time or have any integrity whatsoever and just put others before us time after time after time to add another 1.5 hours of singers between our first songs.

In the end I paid the bill and left after waiting 2.5 hours. Very dissatisfied.< /review>

Good food and drinks but not welcome to newcomers singing. We waited two hours and our song request never came on. Yet a few 'regulars' went up to sing multiple times.  Will definitely not go to this bar again.< /Review>

Was curious to see how business was after seeing the show. Owner obviously knows more than Ramsay. I would normally never review a place without experiencing it but after reading the asinine replies of the owner I see he represented himself accurately on camera and couldn't not leave a comment. Instead of being a passive aggressive coward that pretends to take advice, just stand up like a man and say you're not interested. But you couldn't pass up a free renovation, eh? Hell, your own father talks negatively about you. Must be embarrassing for him to create a successful template and be ignored by his "sharp as a marble" son.

Find a smaller location with no kitchen and focus on the area that earns the quality reviews. Good beer and karaoke. Hard to screw that up.</Review>

Watched the ‘Gordon Ramsey 24hrs to Hell and Back’ so I was curious how this place is surviving. I hope both Kats will get a better job offer elsewhere. This is by far the most undeserving place. I would certainly not support this restaurant with an owner that doesn’t respect women, re-hire guys who bad mouth women & demoted staff who has potential to grow. Guys, just stop supporting this place & I hope the food is still fresh...<//Text>

This is the very best karaoke establishment: Employees are positive, upbeat & energetic, and they actually remember you after being there ONE TIME only. Food is delicious, fresh, hot & reasonably priced. Huge selection of karaoke tunes. Sound system sounds rich and full, and the weekday kJ KNOWS HOW TO MIX so you sound great. I think ALL of this contributes to the most important part of the experience overall: EVERY time we’ve gone, the audiences are validating, supportive, and always enthusiastically encouraging of singers, which makes this place THEE very best K establishment. FIVE + STARS</Review>

<Review>I love coming here on Fridays and Saturdays because I like to sing ballads because the love songs I sing is because I am living with autism. The people are very very great. I do enjoy being hugged by females after I sing ballads because I am at my best when I sing power ballads I enjoy comingh here on Fridays and Saturdays I enjoy singing epic songs and 70s and 80s music< /Review><username>stephen jackson</username>< pics>

<review>Fun place to celebrate an event by people watching, or singing Karaoke! Wide variety of food and alcohol in a lively environment! Valet parking cost is whatever you want to pay them, which is cheaper than the parking meters near. Friendly staff; bathrooms on premises. Wheelchair accesible.< /review><resp>None</resp>< userid>

I have no confidence to even come here. The owner rehired a perv, demoted the best cook there, demoted a great oriented customer service manager Kat. It's sad, after a few of us seen the show we voted down this restaurant as a go to place. An easy $4,000 with a big group coming into town. Both kat and kat should apply at a high end restaurant and be appreciated.< /Review>< Date>

<review>Earlier review (8 months ago): A great bar, stellar beer list, and friendly staff!

Update: I'm not sure what happened, but service was horrible my last two visits - slow and inattentive. Today, I gave up and went to Irish Times around the corner. Too bad, because I like the bar and the owner, Steve.<//review>< userid>

Fries are bomb here FYI
Came here on a Friday night and it wasn't as crowded as I'd expect it to be
Drinks are kind of pricey ($13 for jameson shot)

The best sound system, song choice and nicest staff in any karaoke bar. My favorite place to sing and goof off after long weeks of hard work.

[ APPENDED ] Boardwalk 11 was recently featured in Gordon Ramsay's "24 Hours of Hell". I hope people will understand that the caricature of this establishment in that show was purely for entertainment, and NOT the real place. This gastropub is STILL amazing and so are the people there.< /Text>

After Seeing this restaurant on TV I thought my family would try it out visiting family, I would give this Restaurant 0 Stars if i could but, The Place was dirty during Dinner hours, the place smelled of a odor I cannot repeat on here just Smelled like Kaka......I ordered sliders and the meat and veggies on it taste sour...I sent it back and they made me another but still the taste was there, my brother ordered fries that was cold and hard.....this Restaurant seems like they do not care, they care more about the people at the bar then the people there ordering food.........,</Text>

I'm so sad.. I love to support local small dive bars, and this spot is super awesome. But tonight,.First of all, the prices are a little steep for what kind of bar this is.  It's a dumpy bar in a strip mall in the middle of Palms - everything should be cheap, but it's not.  I haven't been there lately, but they used to have a two drink minimum on weekend nights.  If you're not careful with what you order, those two things can add up to a pretty serious tab.

Second, I personally think the crowd here is pretty annoying.  I know people love that there are "regulars" here, but I kind of get tired of seeing the same people sing the same stuff every time I'm there.  The big groups that come here e.g. offices parties or bachelorette parties (the worst) can get quite annoying.  Although, this is probably not something unique to Boardwalk 11.

But, the main problem with this place is that on the weekend, the wait can easily be two hours (I've seen longer).  It's kind of tough to sit through people butchering songs for 2+ hours just so you can finally get your one song in.  Also, as I think maybe someone alluded to, the big groups that are there seemingly never have a problem getting their songs in.  Based on what I've seen, I think it's pretty safe to say that there's some shenanigans going on with the waiting list< /text>

Some of the worst food I have ever tasted. Both Kats should be in charge of the place not Steve. It is so sad that you ruined all of the work that Ramsey and your staff worked so hard on.</text>

Good food, awful service. Waited 15 minutes for drink at the bar. Seems if you are not a regular, you are ignored. We were a goup of 4. Gave 2 of us wrong burgers at table service, but begrudgingly corrected their error. Two of my friends went back last week and had problems with the same waitress who claims to have been there for 2 years.</Text>

I’ve been coming here on and off for years and it’s always been a fun time. Last time I went was for a bachelorette party and the place is completely redone! It feels more lounge-ish with a good meals and great snack.</Review>

Surprising that I never wrote a review of Boardwalk 11 - although there's probably a reason for that:  Got 86'd here a while back after killing it on the karaoke stage.  Unfortunately, I do tend to skew pretty highly on the megalomania scale, and basking in the raucous applause of the four or five other barflies in the building after finishing "Time is Running Out" I triumphantly dropped the mic (literally) on to the stage...

The DJ seemingly took umbrage at my antics because before I knew it, he called out to assorted staff to escort me out of the premises to rueful laughter from the crowd...  Eh, I don't blame him, I would've done the same thing were I in his place.<//text>

<text>We went on a Wednesday.Our waitress was excellent. The karaoke was really good. When they say on their website they want good, bad singers. They seemed to have quite a few bad. But later in the evening it was more enjoyable as more better singers arrived. Prices for food were pretty good. Drinks a bit high for my liking, but for LA reasonable. The KJ started catering to his regulars. Our waitress noticed it and while she had no control over what the KJ does. Got the issued resolved quickly. Other than a small incident this was the one the best Karaoke experiences I've had in LA. With good food reasonable prices and great Karaoke. I didn't understand why this place wasn't packed. On the top ten list for best Karaoke. It should have been much higher on the list.< /text>< Date>

I'm not just the weekend karaoke host. I'm also a customer.

The new Breaker 22 kitchen menu is absolutely tops, and before we all begin scrambling to get a chance at the mic each night at 8pm the dining atmosphere is very chill and relaxing.

Now open for breakfast on Saturdays and Sundays at 10am!< /text>

Dan the bartender was awesome. The place itself was busy on a Friday night. The parking lot was packed so parking was tough to find.<//Review>

< review>
I will be back!! 😃 Thank you for making my birthday awesome!!

This place saved the day when I had to swiwtch my venue last minute. They allow birthday cakes to be brought in & they'll sing Happy Bday & have the whole bar join in! The staff here is incredible! They made it a fun special night with great drinks, food & stage! The song selection & sound equipment are excellent too!

But be warned! This place has got talent!!! I've never seen so many talented singers in a karaoke bar (but it is LA, so...)! It wasn't extremely busy (on a Thursday) so my group was able to sing 4-5 times throughout the night & the crowd had an amazing supportive energy so even if you're like me & totally suck at Karaoke lol they make you feel amazing! 😃

I can't wait to go again!</review>

From my first visit I got good drinks, some tasty food, a vast range of songs to choose from, and friendly staff. Strangely, I was not asked for my ID at any point (neither entering the bar, nor when ordering drinks).</Review>

Saturday and Sunday brunch has the best breakfast in LA. Juicy thick bacon, thick sausage, fresh hashbrowns or potatos, pancakes and french toast, and the yummy belgium waffles! Only on the weekends and stops at 3pm! You wont be disapointed!<//Text>

<Text>I came to do two things...spend money on food and drink, and do some karaoke. The sleazeball DJ will skip you indefinitely if you dont give him cash (sorry, my card was at the bar). I caught him let the 50-something child predators skip to the front of the line for that sweet payola. F you, chump. You dont have a shred of decency. Bartenders all look like they want to kill themselves. I dont need even OK service...you could even spit in my face for all I care...all I want is the chance GIVE YOU MONEY in exchange for your goods. Its really not that hard and the place was empty. First and last visit to a depressing loserville. If you arent a local you are invisible. Free drinks being poured to buddies on the owners dime in exchange for a crisp 20. How do you leave a bar thirsty? This joint is pathetic and sad for all ages.< /Text>< pictures>

Was having an ok time till the karaoke host didnt want me to sing a song. He said, i quote "are you kidding me dude? Thats so filipino of you. Are you really gonna sing that song?".

First of all, Eric, you are racist and your job is not to yell me what to sing. Your job is to write it down and play it. Do your job and stfu.< /Review>

I don't normally write reviews on places I haven't been to but just saw them on 24 hours to Hell and Back and I'm disgusted by the sad excuse of an owner. Apparently he doesn't want a successful restaurant. The changes to staff make that apparent.<//text>

<review>The place should have continued to follow Ramsay's advice. Sad to see the owner wasn't strong enough to do that. A dirty place with ROACHES and terrible ROTTEN food is going to continue to be the theme. Shame that it is going to end up like the rest of the owners other failed restaurants.< /review>< Name>

<resp>{'time': 1550321914922, 'text': 'I really don’t understand why people are giving us a one star rating and have never been in the restaurant. If you will look at the ratings before Ramsey came in and made us look so bad, you would see that we are getting mostly 5 star ratings. Have you ever thought that maybe the show was rigged to make us look bad? It’s only Hollywood, we really aren’t as bad as the tv show put us out to be. How can we look so bad overnight? It took us 17 years to build up a following and one day to tear it down. Please consider this before you rate us because of a reality tv show. Come in and see for yourself, we really aren’t that bad.\n\nP.S. The two Kat’s are still here. Keith is gone.'}</resp>< userid>
