I’ve never had a more pleasant eye exam. Everyone was super helpful and friendly and I would recommend anyone to come here. Dr. Vu is great at what he does and has great jokes. He put me at ease and I can’t wait for my glasses to get in. The girls up front were friendly and helped me pick out the perfect frames.</Review>

<review>Extremely dissatisfied. Went for an appt in May to get fitted for new contacts and my prescription changed. They didn’t have any at the office for me to try on. Said to come back in a week. I’ve checked in twice. It’s now the end of August! I don’t have any contacts left. No one has contacted me. They apologize every time I check in and say they’ll put the order in right away.< /review>< user_name>

Overall it was OK. Dr. Vu did not explain what he was doing during the exam but scolding me for saying I couldn't see the bottom line. When I was scolded for not wearing my glasses and being current with  an exam I told him I had no vision insurance until recently. Humiliating! He accused me of going to bed without cleaning my eyes because of my eye makeup which is the furthest thing from true.he degraded me the entire time and talked to me like I was stupid. The girls up front were sweet kind and patient with me. If it were based on the girls selling everything  I'd give 5 stars. But Dr Vu was rude and egotistical. I did not appreciate how I was spoke to and do not know if if ever come back based on how I felt.< /Text>

Dr. Vu is awesome and his staff was very friendly and helpful. They were having a hard time finding my insurance but kept at it and in the end solved the issue for me. The appointment was great and Dr. Vu is easy to talk to, explained everything thoroughly to and he’s funny and made me feel comfortable during my visit. He made the experience a breeze and enjoyable. I’ll definitely be referring him to friends and family.</Review>

<text>Dr. Vu, was pleasant, professional and extremely through in his analysis of letting me know where my former eye glasses stood compared with my eyes currently...I noticed a huge difference in the clarity and crispness in my prescription; I am grateful Target decided to open an optomery center here in Redlands and look forward to making Dr. Vu my primary optomertrist.</text><gmapID>0x80dcacceb583f185:0x20176c6504977441< /gmapID><Time>1606628715530<//Time><user_name>Raul Rodriguez</user_name><rate>5< /rate></record>

I went into Van's to buy a gift for someone, it was early afternoon and the store was empty. The staff didn't once ask if I needed help and like other reviews have said, I felt like they were too bothered and annoyed.
I was in the store for quite a while too and the only service (if that) was when I asked for a size. BUT, to top it off, NONE of the shoes I asked for (probably asked for 5 or 6 different ones) were in the size I wanted. You'd think that the staff would have offered a solution or alternative? You would think they would act like they wanted me to buy something? At least point me to their website right?? Nope.
So I ended up leaving, having bought nothing with such a bad taste in my mouth. Never going back. I'm not asking for star quality service, but just common basic service. You can find so much better at other stores.<//review>

<Text>Quality workmanship with great customer service.

I brought my Jeep here to get worked on. They only charge to inspect your vehicle if you don't do the work with them. I decided to have the the work done here so there was no inspection fee, only charged for the parts and labor. The jeep is running great again.</Text>

<Text>These guys are the best.  Whenever we need body work done we take it to Lucky Auto Body Repair.  My wife is a frequent customer (which is good for them!) and each time they do fantastic work.  We've done both insured work as well as paid for work directly out of our pocket and they've given us a discount on the work without me needing to ask.  They keep us updated on the work progress and put a nice polish on the car when its done.  Really top quality job from a service standpoint, at drop off to pick up, and on the final product itself.  I wash my cars myself, because I'm cheap and I feel I can do a better job than the car wash.  I'm pretty focused on details and I approve of quality of their work.  As long as they are in business we'll continue to take our auto body repair needs to them.  Also, shout out to Ray who helped us most recently and was quite the man all around.  Thanks Lucky Auto Body Repair !< /Text>< response>

<time>1597895655865<//time><Rate>4</Rate><text>I really felt well taken care of by Lucky Auto Body Repair. They were really helpful in suggesting two options to fix the scratch and dent I had on my mini. I appreciated the honesty and openness with the estimate. Drop off was easy and they were very clear about the process including Covid cleaning my car. It was also great to be kept up to date on the status of the repair via text message. Pickup was pretty seamless as well. My car was spotless and my front hood looked brand new. Everyone wore masks and everyone was very friendly while I was waiting to pick up. I'll definitely go back with any auto body work in the future.</text>< pics>

My BMW had a leak inside so I brought my car here because I knew I would receive great service.. and I did! Everyone I came across was super friendly - I'm pretty sure it's a family run business so that explains a lot. They were able to fix the leak and got my car back in a timely manner. Will definitely continue recommend!</text>

Their customer service was excellent and after they got done with my car, i could not tell that it has been in a wrecked before.  the paint matches the rest of the car, looks just like new! highly recommended!<//Review>< UserId.>

<Review>Took my truck in for some body service. Decided to go with a new paint job. Couldn't be any more happy with the job. The fast easy process from choosing a good color to the great detail job they did. They went way above what was called for. My truck looks brand new. If you just want a touch up job up to a full paint job there the guys you need to see thanks again guys keep up the good work...< /Review>< Pictures>

Lucky Auto Body Repair Body Shop did a fantastic job with the repair, the panel looks brand new (because it is!), and they matched the paint perfectly. The whole process was great from beginning to end - very friendly, helpful, and educated staff and mechanics. Very good and frequent communication. I would highly recommend this auto body shop to anyone.</text>

I love Lucky Auto Body Repair! Noe was very friendly and kind. They took perfect care of my car and it looks beautiful. I had my insurance view the car at the shop and everything went smoothly. They even detailed the car before I picked it up. I recommend them highly!< /text>

Incredibly nice staff and great service. They worked very hard to make sure I was happy and were very honest about labor/pricing. Would highly recommend! My issue was resolved very fast and the damage to my car was dealt with. If I ever get in another accident or damage my car (I hope not) I will take it back here in a heartbeat.<//text>

If you ever need any body work done on your car,Lucky Auto Body Repair is the place to go.  The owner, Noe, is very helpful and honest.  He will make sure everything runs smoothly (with or without insurance).  His staff is very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable.  On top of that, your car will look great when he's done with it!!!<//Review>

My car's, tire and rim were broken. The suspension was also damaged. It was a very stressful time however, Eddie from Mike's auto was able to help me and bring down the stress level for this situation. They did an amazing job at the shop, the high quality and professionalism really I impressed me. I live in Boyle Heights, but I will definitely go back here for all my car needs.<//Text>

Best shop I've been too!! They call me as soon as they have any type of update so that I know exactly what is going on and what stage my car is in during the repairs. Apart from them keeping me updated they were also super friendly and did a GREAT job with my car. This is the only shop I recommend to anyone whenever I get asked now! Thanks Lucky Body Shop!!< /review>

<text>Great shop & even better people!!  Had a chunk of metal debris hit my A pillar hard and leave a cratered dent.  Difficult spot to fix.  The guys at Lucky took great care of me and the job.  They were super easy to work with, coordinated with my insurance company Geico seamlessly, and set me up with the rental.  By far the easiest body repair experience i have ever had.  With covid-19 and my preference to limit social interaction, they actually came and picked up my car and swapped it out with a rental!  Car is now back and looking good.  My wife was even surprised how clean the interior was after getting it back from the shop.  I also know they do a steady flow of luxury vehicles as authorized body shop for Mercedes.  Thank you Mark, Joshua, & Lucky Team!<//text><response>{'time': 1600207837036, 'text': "Hey Eric, happy to hear we took good care of you here!

I took my car to Lucky Auto Body Repair after checking out several body shop options in the area that were well reviewed on google.  Noe was very helpful to me, both in getting the job done, and working with the insurance company.  My car had been seriously smashed by a bus and suffered significant damage, but Noe and his crew took care of it .  Noe was honest, knowledgeable and cares about his community.< /Text>

Very friendly staff and great service. I got rear-ended and was dealing with a terrible insurance company that was very unresponsive. I dropped off my car with Robert and he worked with the insurance company so I didn't have to and kept me in the loop on any updates. They made the whole process very painless and I will certainly go back to them in the future.< /Text>

<Text>Avenue is the best body shop experience I have ever had, hands down! They went so far above and beyond in fixing my car that I'm still in disbelief.

Being in a car accident was a harrowing affair, but Sunny Auto Body helped make the process more manageable.  I received an estimate in very timely fashion, and Lucky Auto Body Repair was able to shop around to get quality parts at good prices.  Sunny got the job done, and did not try to add anything unnecessarily.  Mike kept me informed of the status throughout the process, which I really appreciated.  I am extremely happy with the quality of the work, my car looks better than before the accident.  I would definitely recommend Lucky Auto Body Repair.< /text>

<Text>Great service and experience. Everyone was so nice and courteous. Getting in an accident is already a pain in the butt but they made it so easy. I get intimidated by body shops but everyone here was so kind. I never felt like I was getting the run around. They did a great job on my car and I highly recommend them to everyone</Text>< Resp>

Excellent body/repair shop. I would not use any other from here on out. Seamless and very through job. Excellent communication and I was well taken care of. They had to fight a bot with insurance because insurance companies are really cutting back and cutting costs at our expense. These guys do it right!<//Text>

After a small mishap from pulling out of my garage, I took my car to Lucky Auto Body to get an estimate to see how much it would cost to repair. I met with the manager and his quote was very competitive with the other few shops I had gotten quotes from. What differentiated Lucky Auto Body from the other shops was that there was no run around and I felt they didn't try to take advantage of me being a woman who knows nothing about car repairs.

Long story shory, they repaired my car within the given time frame and my car was looking as good as it did when it first came off the lot. Thank you so much Lucky Auto Body!<//review>

<review>I can see why Chapparone gets such high ratings here.  I had some work done on my car from someone backing into me.  Chris was awesome to work with.  He keeps me up to date on what's going on with the insurance company and with the car.

Not only did they did a stellar job on the repair, they even polish the head lights, fix the ding in the fender and the big scratch on the door. The car was waxed and polished at time of pick up.  Needless to say I highly recommend Chapparone.</review><user_name>Kimberly Brackett<//user_name>< Resp>

<review>My parked vehicle was involved in a hit and run accident.  I started to research in Koreatown area for a reliable and fast turnaround auto body shop.  Lucky Auto Body Shop has been in the business for almost 30 years, and their facility seems well established, therefore I decided to check it out.  The estimator Mario M. was very professional, and explained the repair, and the insurance claim processes clearly to me.  He was very responsive with me and my insurance company via phone calls and emails.  As the result, I got my car back within the estimated timeline.  Highly recommended.< /review>< Pictures>

< review>
This review is long overdue. Long story short, my wife scraped the passenger side rear quarter panel of her CT200h while pulling out of our garage a few months prior to the lease maturity date. I was referred to Mark over at Lucky Auto Body by a friend and scheduled an appointment with him to get a quote and timeframe. He said it would take approximately 4-5 days to repair and scheduled to have it dropped off a week prior to it going back to the dealership. I was a bit skeptical at first (given my experience with most body shops tend to go past their given timeframes), but Mark guaranteed it would be ready and sure enough the car was ready to pick up 5 days later.

They did a great job on the repairs, kept me up to date, and most importantly, came through as promised on the timeline. I couldn't be happier and would not hesitate to recommend them to others.

Thanks Lucky Auto Body!</review>

First off, BEAUTIFUL salon. Hands down most beautiful nail salon I've ever been to. Brand new, modern, beautiful lighting. Very reasonably priced too! I had a fill with gel coat, pedicure with gel coat, and a wax and it was just $95. My nails and toes look PERFECT. And the wax lady really knew what she was doing. They have this roller thing that the wax comes out of...I've never seen it before. It's like basically a big ball point pen that wax comes out of and there are different sizes depending on what size area you're waxing. Makes it so you can really easily control where the wax goes. I can't say enough good things about this place. I was very happy with my visit!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>As a Nail tech myself, I am APPALLED at how you treat your customers. If you were truly educated properly on skin conditions (which you legally are supposed to be) you would never refuse service to someone who has a skin condition. I am disgusted at this and you guys might be good at what you do but your customers come first. Next continuing education class you go to, make sure you pay attention and do your research.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Happy Nails isn’t a happy place to pay for a service. All the culture of these employees around other cities are the same, they threat customers like making them a favor I never saw something like these in my life living in different countries. I used to do my nails in one of these salons because I work in the same area, but I don’t want to go back there anymore, is miserable they talk in their language between them and you realize that they are talking about you and they just don’t care about your feelings, like this woman victim of what they do with others because of her skin, she has had the face to show the world what they did to her, they did with me in other way so I know how she feels too.<//Text>

< Review>
I totally agree with what the technician did. It’s best for both side for the further future. First, the client should’ve let them know about her health condition before letting them service her either pedicure or manicure. Second of all, if the technician gave her the service, later on her skin condition getting worst, she’ll file a charge on them. Because we cannot just trust anyone in this society. There are some salon were pressed charged on similar cases like this, they know what’s best for them and for the client before they refused to service her. To protect themselves and to avoid client’s awareness further acussion. I think if the client told them from the first time she walked into that salon about her skin condition, they might not only refused to service her nails, but also her toes. Or on the other side, they might find a way to work it out to make the client doesn’t feel that they’re racist or insulting her. Every job has the rules/laws that employees must follow and obey.< /Review>

<Review>Love this place — the team of manicurists they have here are very dedicated and caring of their clients. They always do a fantastic job with my nails. Especially Kathy — she is my girl! She is the best manicurist I’ve ever had the pleasure of working on my nails. I always make an appointment with her if I can; especially for fills, new sets or any other designs. Kathy just knows exactly the way I like my nails so it’s always easier (for my ocd mindset lol, she is also a perfectionist) to have her do the more expensive work.< /Review><rate>5< /rate>< resp>

<Text>I went three weeks ago and got a natural pink gel manicure and it was so thick, it literally fell off my thumb in one piece. They also gave me ingrown toenails in two toes! I have never had this until immediately after I went there. I went back, stupidly thinking that they could see the thick job they did and do better. My gel manicure would not dry!!!! I showed the manicurist how bumpy it was and she claimed it wasn't.

The reason I get gel is so that it doesn't get dented; however, my nails are bumpy. FROM GEL! They said they would re-do them, but now I have to take time from my limited schedule to sit there all over again.

Did I mention, they cut my cuticle to the point of drawing blood? But, it's not their fault because, they say I have "thin skin". Oh, but my ingrown toenails are because I have fat toe skin. Again, not their fault. Excuses, excuses.<//Text>< pictures>

Very inconsiderate. Don't waste your time or money .Especially your time because you'll probably be turned away if you aren't up to there beauty standards. If you are concerned about health risks you shouldn't give a pedicure but refuse a manicure .Makes no logical sense .<//Review>

Not only to cut my toe nails and color then.
Then I have my eyebrows wax and the top part of my lips. They shape it, but when I came home I have to remove my hears of the eyelids,  I feel
Like better toss that money into the garbage container,  that is the worse

Horrible, experience. I'm a cosmetologist so i know how to do my nails but sometimes feels good just to relax .my nails were not straight, and nail not clean enough so because of that when they apply the nail polished looked all lumpy and not even.more like a hom made work. When u pay $30 for a pedicure that doesn't feel so good. Asked the lady to do my nails straight across since she Deming even ask what i want and she was defensive. When my nails were done were so bad that i ask her is she could buf them and do them again more even . She was defensive and didn't seem to care much. She asked someonelse do to the job since she got tired. The second lady did just as bad as the first so i had to ask them ta take polish off since I wasn't going to walk around with my cuticles all painted . Is a very expensive place for the job that they do. Sinc I'm a profecional i cant just walk around looking like that. I will never go back and don't recommend the place</review>

Although I live in Auburn, which is 30 miles away in the foothills, I always visit this Sacramento branch to service all my Cricket needs. The reason is simple: fast , efficient , courteous service from all associates. In particular, LizBeth always expedites my orders quickly while Malik ( Manager) provides super tech support. His knowledge  +  desire to go beyond 100% for any question is truly astounding. Malik has saved me time, money and headaches with all my cell phone concerns. Highly recommend this Cricket Wireless location!< /review>

<review>My boyfriend and I went into cricket to buy a phone case right here on El Camino there was a woman sitting at the counter helping someone else,   We patiently waited for 25 minutes the lady working was named CHEY  she did not say one word to us not can I help you one second please what can I do for you nothing as we were waiting she also answered a phone call and help the people on the phone as she was on the phone to more customers walked in behind us at that point after waiting 25 minutes we walked out as we were leaving we look back and see her helping the people that came in after us the customer service there is terrible!!!!!! Are we were trying to do is buy a phone case I am a customer there for at least a year now and bought my iPhone there so as you know I’ve spent a lot of money with cricket they treat their customers bad and they don’t have a problem doing it< /review>< Date>

I walked in and waited 15 minutes for the dealer here to tell me I couldn't buy a phone on display because it was too overpriced (on sale for 1/3 of the retail price, and under $100). He then tried to tell me  what phone he thought I needed and upsell me at three times the price of the phone I came in to buy. I may be a woman, but I am a professional software developer, I know what I want, and I walked out and bought my phone elsewhere. I must say, it's exactly the phone I wanted, and performs exactly as I thought it would.</text>

Set up and configured my phone quickly despite the problems caused by my former cellular service.  The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful.  The cost of their service is less than that of my former cellular service.</text>

When in Berkeley that was my favorite spot. The musical offering is a pearl in the desert of quality venues. It's not just the food (good!!!) Nor the music played there live and offline (good!!!). It's the atmosphere. Go there. You'll come back. For sure. 10 STARS!!<//Review>

A quiet and nice place with European atmosphere. There's classical music playing at the background, what makes it a perfect place for studying or chatting. Nothing spectacular about food or drinks though, they are fine.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Best cafe and bistro in Berkeley! As good as the University of California Press bookstore next door. (I’m from Davis.:) You can also (over)hear lots of interesting conversations between Berkeley professors and listen to fine classical live music.

Mak-amham cafe OHLONE pop-up
Is the real deal local to the SF Bay area of California, this is thriving indigenous cuisine.  Everyone must go.  Vincent Medina, co-founder, an indigenous Muwekma Ohlone is enchanting, such a local treasure, after serving all of us he then gave us the gift of the traditional Ohlone story of the 'Blood Monster'.

Came on a Tuesday night
tawwa-sii

Set menu was sweets and tea
Cafe style order and pay first
Then, elders served first

Sweets—
Smooth and creamy chia pudding
With gooseberries, blkberries, strawberries and cactus, sprinkled with stone ground hazelnuts and garnished with violas.  With hazelnut/acorn brownies sprinkled w locally foraged East Bay salt.

and Tea—
Rosehip + Elderberry + Nettle

Set Menu is seasonal
Elders served first.
No plastic, combination of greenware and glassware.

I brought my own water, may next time bring my own plate/utensils (zero waste thinking)...
Definitely will be back.</review>

I used to work here in the early aughts when I lived in the area. Eating here on my off hours was always a pleasure. Enjoying a soup and salad with a hot cup of coffee, classical music playing in the background and rain outside... A cozy and comforting environment. Fifteen years later and I still remember this place from time to time. Wish I could fly across the country just to spend another afternoon here.<//text>

< review>
I really like this place. The menu choices are limited, but what they make is very good and refined. I usually order a sandwich salad soup which is very well priced another ten bucks. It is 1 of the few places where I like to also pick up baked goods like banana bread. Enjoy their drink selection ranging from freshly made juices to coffee and if you are meeting someone for  lunch and arrive early, you can peruse the back of the restaurant where they share a space with a local classical CD record/album vendor. The only drawback to the cafe is the size and limited seating. I do enjoy sitting in the upper section but it is quite cramped and if you go with a large group larger than 4 you only have seating options at the front for maybe up to 6. As a health-conscious adults I love this place. But if I took my kids here they would really struggle with what to choose beyond the baked goods and juices.</review>

This cafe / music shop is cool I came in on my way to the passport office at cal Berkeley. The staff are friendly and the coffee not half bad either even though my coffee was wrong thought wth why not try something new you might like it I ordered a hazelnut latte and ended up with a hazelnut mocha. My only complaint would be the rest room situation it’s way to confusing and it’s technically wasn’t even in the cafe at all. So here is how it went down I asked the barista if I could use the restroom and she replied “the key is in the cream bar take it to the back threw the kitchen make a right go threw the door make a right then a left threw another door and it’s to the right” who is going to remember all of that let alone find a single key on the smallest key ring possible for the restroom. It was like where’s Waldo bathroom edition not to mention there was a shower in the restroom wth</review>

This is an amazing cafe right next to one of the best bookstores in the city.  The food is great and the atmosphere is fitting for its location next to the university.<//review>

< Review>
Their lunch is mediocre at the best. Despite the "cafe" in the name, they don't allow customers to have their coffee/tea inside during the lunch hours. Also, they don't serve breakfast during the weekends.<//Review>

<review>Great food (their pastries are to die for!), friendly service always willing to chat, and good coffee at a reasonable price, and if you come at the right time it's a great place to study.</review><user_id>108047315656055238364<//user_id><pictures>None</pictures>< username>

This can be a nice place to study. They have some, not many, power outlets. The food is good, but overpriced.<//review>

Expensive. I was here for a free lecture (which was fun). They had happy hour prices posted and no indication that they wouldn't honor them for the lecture, but had jacked the prices.  Small pour of wine.  It is conveniently located and cute, so I might have otherwise been tempted back.</Text>

<review>The food is okay, but the workers here need to change their attitude and be a little nice to customer. I'm a daily customer that get up with their mean faced and rude treatment especially the guy.
It's the closest location to my house however now I drive extra 2 miles to about bad service.</review><gmapID>0x809ad651233e9c1d:0x8f2306d3ac5eeab8</gmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< date>

Came in for lunch and was greeted by Lana with a smile and a friendly attitude. I don’t visit subway often and not too familiar with the menu but Lana was patient and willing to help. One of the best fast food customer services I’ve came across.<//text>

< review>
This Subway is under new management and ownership! THANK GOD! The new managers and owners are amazing!. The level of customer service and sandwich preparation went from about a 3/10 to 9/10 to 10/10 depending on the employee you get. All new crew, so much better then the last crew. Everyone knows what they are doing, my sandwiches get marked so I'm not scrambling and having to open every sandwich to figure out which one goes to who. They are fast, really well at asking for additional add-ons which I wouldn't otherwise think to add, but when I do the flavor just rises to the top! Definitely the BEST Subway in Sacramento, tied with the other Subway farther down Truxel next to Bella Bru! Everyone must go to both, you definitely wont regret it. Sandwich in the air because I'm HAPPY!< /review>

<Time>1354759046050<//Time><Rating>2<//Rating><text>Rode my bike to this subway this afternoon. There was no bike rack nor pole to chain my bike. The column outside the subway was too thick to use. I leaned my bike against the column (about three feet from the storefront window) and kept an eye on it while I ordered a sandwich. I sat at a table right next to the window to eat.  Older teens started congregating around my bike. There are section eight apartments near-by, and thievery has been a problem.  As the group built up to five kids (as old as early 20s), I went to the window to make it obvious I was watching my bike. They got even closer to the bike.I asked the woman running this subway if I could move my bike inside. She absolutely refused. One of the kids grabbed my bike, but before he could ride off, I confronted him and grabbed my bike back ( I'll be 60 next year). Fortunately, the others didn't try to jump me. I moved the bike inside the subway, and the manager again told me to move it outside. I told her I was going to finish my sandwich and she was free to call the cops.  BTW the manager was Indian, the teens black, and I am Chicano. I blame the manager. To be fair, the younger worker ( probably her son) later took my bike outside and held onto it until I finished my sandwich. All told, a less than pleasant dining experience.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Great customer service and fast pace!! Love the delicacy, creativity, and love they put into their sandwich making. I drive sometimes all the way from folsom for this subway for folsom and eldorado hills subways i've always had very un professional slow and sloppy subway sandwiches but here in natomas they really show how a Subway should be.</text><name>Amara Vayder</name><rating>5< /rating></record>

<review>Great place to bring kids for a quick ice cream day. Significantly challenging for parking here. Especially if you have an SUV. But if you are safe you can navigate well and find a spot. There are two handicapped parking places and a ramp up to the doorway for wheelchair bound people. Very convenient.< /review>< pics>

<review>Friendly and helpful customer service. Went in on a Saturday for an ice cream cake. Great and varied selection, quick service and plenty of parking. I chose a praline vanilla ice cream cake with blue icing, my husband loved it! They also sell candles, colorful and numbered too.</review>< gmapID>

<text>Ice cream delicious. We were sitting inside eating our ice cream. My 6 year old had to go pee bad, but they said no public restroom. I understand them turning away adults, but the little guy can't hold it that long. Luckily the insurance place next door was nice enough to let him use their restroom.< /text>< pictures>

This is my favorite ice cream shop! I love the creaminess of their ice cream and the assorted flavors, which rotates depending on availability and season.  The staff are always friendly and efficient.</Review>

Wow, what a disappoint please don't sell any pops if you're not going to limit the sales so everyone can get a chance to buy one. I went in to buy one and the employee told me they sold all 12 to one person this morning. Hmmm 🤔 maybe someone should have limited it to per person. I won't ever buy here again Doc Bernstein's has more common sense and better ice cream.< /review>

<text>The BEST place to go for Cappuccino's and Ice Cream.🍦but when it comes down to the customer's they'll skip you if they see a friend they skip you and go straight to them. And the workers play music out loud that they shouldn't play with cussing in it.<//text></record>

Brought my daughter and her twi girls. She was having a bad day so I figured how could you go wrong with Baskan Robbins. So many great flavors... The staff was generous with samples for the kids. We had a great time. They have it all here from.shakes to cakes to banna splits and sundays. Sugar cones to waffle cones something for everyone. They take credit & debit cards as well as cash they haven a good size parking lot which is handicap friendly.</text>

<review>Visiting from LA. I parked overnight here instead of valet parking at Marriott.Thinking that the regular self parking would be cheaper than valet parking.  Boy was I wrong. Marriott valet parking cost $50, this parking charged $60.

I would def park somewhere else if I have known this fact. The parking entrance & exit way are tight, so drive carefully if your car is SUV.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSYMIytg02ZQAI-ZH8oacSgvKByMiUiQ8Gx6mC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMq0y2PZOyjRgVl8lasp6nHdJjXPL7bNWUQt9Kn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Date>

<Review>Don’t be surprised when your window is busted and car ransacked. Don’t worry the sketchy security guard didn’t see anything. Cameras? Don’t worry about them. Management won’t do a thing to help you after your vehicle has been broken into as well. Tried to blame it on homeless as if they broke in, stole everything/used a company credit card.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
This garage is terrible! Canceling my monthly parking pass immediately. I have had it for 3 months and it is a scam. 235$ a month, you think they would have their stuff figured out. The automatic machine Barry ever works right. At least once I month I have to pay $60 to get out because the machine claims I have never entered or it has no log of me entering the garage. No one ever answers when you call the office for support. Even when you leave a message, you never receive a callback. The parking spots are small and the area is not maintained. There are multiple other garages in the area that are not LAZ. I would highly suggest using them instead.<//Review>

Confusing prices and they know it. They change their prices on me in between me parking there. Park on the street. It’s cheaper, safer and smells better. Charged us $60 while we went to comic con...comic con doesn’t even cost that much to get in!<//Text>

I am not one to write a bad review but I want to inform other people of my experience before parking here. On a Friday night parking was advertised as $10. I asked the attendant and that price was good until 6am and from there on our until the following day at midnight would be an extra $15. After getting there at 9pm Friday evening and leaving 11am the next day, I was charged $50 when leaving. $50 for 14hours even though I was told at most it would be $25. I wasn't that upset because I figured I would call and get it all settled out. I called Friday but no one could help me until Monday. Called Monday and was told the manager would call me back to discuss it at some point that day. No call. Called again Today and was told the manager or assistant manager would be calling me. Still no call.<//text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>We had a prepaid parking at this place yesterday afternoon for the Padre game.  We used Park Whizz & had a barcode on our phone.  For some reason our scan wasn’t working to enter in this place.  We had people behind us wanting to get in as well.  We had to think fast so we used our credit card because  we won’t get charged until we exit (that’s what we read). After the game, we get to our exit & tried to scan our code again.  It actually scanned this time!!!!!  But it didn’t recognize the code.  There was no attendant at the entrance but one at the exit.   He was totally rude!!!  He told us to press the button to talk to someone.  We did that but the lady we talked to was impatient & just hung up on us.  At this point,  we felt we had no choice but to use our credit card to leave this garage.  We had several cars behind us so we just wanted to leave & take care of this issue later (which we did the morning!). As soon as the gate opened,  that attendant (older Asian man) yelled at us to leave.  He didn’t have to be a jerk about it!  Park Whizz resolves our issue the following day & everything is fine.  I do not recommend this parking garage to anyone period!< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Atrocious. I ordered a bundle for a concert and parking here. The ticket from 5th parking indicated parking is good for up to two hours after your show ends. They tried to make me pay and additional $12 because of overages that it clearly indicated I would not be charged on the tickets. After spending 5 minutes on the Telecom with someone in a remote site I was allowed to leave without paying extra. Terrible service</review><Rating>1<//Rating><resp>None</resp>< name>

Beware!! This parking structure deceives the public. They state that their evening parking is $10. but they fail to visibly post that it doesn't start until 6pm.
We arrived a 5:53pm and our $10. parking fee turned into $22.00
There is no way to file a complaint unless you have the # on the parking ticket, so take a picture before depositing into their payment machine.</Review>

Fries were very soggy. The bread is good l and soft. The pastrami is very tasty. The gravy is a bit too salty but still fairly good. I'll try the dip next time but I already know what to expect for the most part< /review>

Best food ever. It's location is the original hat. Prices are great for the food. I believe there are 9 locations & out of all the locations. I've been to 7 out of 9.

The ones I've been to we're the best. I've tried almost all of the choices. And have not been disappointed yet.

Be certain when ordering fries and onion rings. Order a small one.
Because a small one is for two and a large is for at least 4 to 5 people.

It's certain that you'll have to go back more than once to try out all the food. Because you're not going to be able to try them all out in one day.
Enjoy.</Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>First time there. Amazing food. Minus one star cuz I had to ask for condiments instead of being offered when picked up order. Had I not asked, would not have known that they have ranch packets. Come to find out after they also have pickles and pepperoncini as condiments. That's half the experience! But the Cashier service: excellent!</text><UserId.>109119463879962005152< /UserId.></record>

Pastrami is tasty, not salty, lots of meat/large portion.  One sandwich is good for 2 people.  Large portions of large fries and onion rings good for 4 people.  Price is reasonable.  Wait time is not that bad depending if it is peak time.  My wife had it for the first time and she loves it.< /Text>

< Review>
This message is for Mr. Don Cook, manager of C & J Food Company/ The Hat.

I was unable to contact you directly and my hope is you will read this at some point.

I was a first time visitor to The Hat in Alhambra and had a terrible experience with the service there.

The host/ cashier was a Hispanic man who was extremely rude. A simple question about the sizes of the fries seemed to annoy him and he put forth an air of being terribly inconvenienced by having to even speak to me. This person has zero people skills or patience for basic interaction.

I felt rushed along and treated very poorly. Please pay closer attention to the attitude of the people you hire. If you have to deal with the general public you must possess more courtesy and patience. I was very polite and should not have been treated like an inconvenience. It wasn't even that busy when I was there. Literally one person ahead of me and no one else showed up until several minutes after my order.

This person needs to be taught some manners.<//Review>

<Text>Pastrami-centric joint serving up some great pastrami fries. They're currently operating during coronavirus both through drive through and for takeout. I would suggest calling ahead to place your order as the drive through line was long. They had our food ready in ~15 min. There was a minor issue when we called in the order; the first time, the person on the other side didn't hear us and the second time the call didn't go through. Third times a charm though, so luckily we were able to indulge.

This isn't on the menu, but if you want to have a lunch that serves 3-4 people, you can order the wet fries (the gravy it comes with is so creamy and heavy) with pastrami and cheese on top (extra for both items). The pastrami is thinly sliced and they do not skimp. They did a good job of mixing the things so that even the fries on the bottom had a mix of gravy and pastrami in there. The fries are standard cut and we're piping hot. We went into a minor food coma afterwards

It's super clean inside. They do take credit cards. Service is quick and efficient. Overall it's a good spot to partake in pastrami and treat yourself should you ever find yourself around the Brea Mall.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOznGpHaOqY--HHtpEmwfUT-1lG5TAbeos2emuh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNap86cpLysRoNerm057g6kbsG0C3KFChQLEzGW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2c5378d99052d:0xd9cb1762718872c0</gmapID></record>

I just don't get what's great about this place. Salty and tasteless gravy on soggy fries...and Arby's makes far better pastrami as far as I remember. Expensive too. AVOID.< /text>

Ps. I personally go only for the Chilli pastrami fries 🍟.   (Wish half the fries amount were given, I don't like throwing food out) last but not least 2 of us eat from 1 order and have food left over.< /text>< pics>

The Hat has lost its luster. My Pastrami dip was cold, and poorly dressed. Bread was soggy, and the added cheddar was more like crumble.  Fries also soggy. Overall not much better than a bad greasy spoon. There are plenty of other classic burger stand in the area that are better.</Text>

<Text>I am very disappointed, this was my first time here and LAST. We ordered 1 double cheeseburger, 1 cheeseburger, 1 Jr burger, 2 small fries, and 2 drinks. The quality of the burger and TASTE was honestly worst than dissatisfying (There was no flavor in the burger). My local burger shop is WAYYYY Better than The Hat. The burgers were not seasoned and the bun was stiffer than any other burger I’ve had. The FRIES....they were under seasoned which was a disappointment. If you’re known for pastrami you could at least make some decent burgers..This was a WASTE OF MONEY to be honest (you know that feeling that you wished you should have just gone to your regular burger spot-Well that’s how I feel) The drive was not worth it. We were craving burgers and this was not what we were expecting...</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><date>1607048506502< /date><Rating>1<//Rating>< Response>

Open late. Nice seating area. Cool size parking lot. Good prices.

The food is really good and they give you a lot. Everything is delicious and fresh. Love to come here at night. Especially in the summer after it cools down in the evening.

If you love Pastrami sandwiches this is the place to get one.<//review>

<review>The food is delicious and you get WAY to much. And the price matches the amount of food. Spent $19.37 for a pastrami, fries and drink. At least with the amount of food, I'll have two meals which makes the price point s little more bearable.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Had the Pastrami $11.00 but it's huge enough for two people. Would love some chill cheese fries but they only make one size. Way to much for one person and why they don't make a smaller order is unclear.</Text>

<Text>Well overall a good Pastrami it didn't live up to my anticipation from the memory of the place when I used to live in LA. The bun was just ok leaning towards a mass produced commercial item. The Pastrami was good but the meat seemed a little dry. Maybe I'm just getting a little too picky as I get older.< /Text>< Pics>

Still one of the best pastrami spots around. Double dipped with a bunch of pickle spears is the way to go! The steak sandwiches are really good too; tender steak in a toasty roll... yum. Plus some fries with gravy round out a perfect meal.<//text>

<text>I have been going to the hat since the late 60's.    Love all their food but the pastrami is my favorite.    Sliced thin for more flavor and lots of it. I also love their roast beef sandwich with gravy burgers are fantastic my favorite place ever</text><name>Dennis Datin<//name><time>1596813883288< /time><response>None<//response>< user_id>

I would have been solid with a delicious pastrami burger, but felt obligated to get some chili cheese fries.  Only thing was that there was another two pounds of fries. They were delicious though.  Getting that all in Lyft to take have to hotel was difficult, but oh so worth it.  Definitely what I needed after not eating all day.<//Text>< Rate>

<rate>2<//rate><text>This is based on safety.  I watch what businesses are doing to keep everyone safe.
Not happy that they are careless. Seems like everyone was being safe but where they fail is the interaction with public and payment. The order taker is also the cashier. So far so good as long as he does not touch anything else. Once Payment transaction is done, no wash of hands nor change of gloves. He write the ticket  then slides it down. It is contaminated.  Then at one point, the handles pull the ticket and cross contaminate everything. Same cashier tries to help by refilling drinks. They use a different cup and pour it to the customer's cup. Is that still safe considering virus is airborne?  Also cashier never changed his gloves when doing this. I am aware many places are careless and I will not go back at this time. Can not take a chance on place that do not realize what they are doing. Cashiers should either have a no touch policy or do no do anything else.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Pastrami burger, definitely has pastrami on it and some of the best tasting I've ever had the pleasure of eating.

Outdoor seating is perfect for southern California weather. Enjoyed it on a Saturday in late January on our way to Disneyland.</Text>

<review>The Hat is a relic of the drive-in era. It's an experience. The food is incredible, even if not the kind of thing you would eat every day. There are many The Hats in SoCal now, but this is the original.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4IYhUFM0beMVSUgIAXuZW1yTqaJoLpm6Kla-9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

The cold beef sandwich is awesome. Get the wet fries; they're gravy fries. I order them with cheese on top so it can be like poutine fries. Awesome place!!!!!< /text>

This place is a great place.  A LOT OF FOOD.  OMG We ordered the pastrami chili cheese fries OMG that is a lot of food.  yummy the meat is so good and moist.  wow it feed me and my husband.
It sits right on the corner and the line goes around the building.  everyone lines up for this place.
We waited a little bit but worth the wait.</Review>

Been coming to this location for years! Me and my family enjoy eating at the hat even though prices have gotten a lot higher from before. Quality of the chillie cheese fries is top notch and so is there pastrami burger what they are actually very known for.<//Review>

I'm sure the pastrami sandwich at this location is pretty delicious. I tried to order a pastrami sandwich, chili cheese fries, and a soda. It came out to like $25 and some change. I have no idea why an order of chili cheese fries is $10 and some change. The chili cheese fries are not that great and who the hell eats that much food in one sitting. Sorry to say but this price is absolutely ridiculous. If the chili cheese fries were actually that great it still wouldn't be worth $10 plus some change for an order of chili cheese fries.</Review>

Great consistent quality and service. I've never gotten a wrong order here nor have they ever forgotten anything.
Their chili is great. I love getting chili cheese fries with pastrami on top. Their steak sandwiches are good, meat is tender, and come with a pickle (excellent pickle!). The burgers are great and larger than average.
Their fries are always great.  Not too crispy and fluffy on the inside. A small fry order is about 1/3 of their paper bags full, it's a pretty generous amount. Enough for 2-4 people, depending on how hungry you are.<//review>

Came here and tried the roast beef with potato salad and it was delicious. So many great things to try I will definitely come back for the chili cheese fries and a pastrami sandwich. Can't say enough good the taste was amazing and great location as well. There was some seating outside which was great for me as I didn't want to drive back 25 min. They also sell grill cheese sandwiches.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c5378d99052d:0xd9cb1762718872c0</Gmap_id><date>1579733834012</date>< Resp>

Great place for a BIG pastrami burger. The portions of the food here is great but the price of some of the items are just too god damn high. The parking lot is big and you won't have trouble finding a spot even if it's super busy but the traffic of this place is horrible between the hours of 3-7:30 pm.<//text>

New review: after 20 years of living in alhambra I discovered I could add pastrami to my chili cheese fries. So happy. So happy.
Old review: Thank you for existing chili cheese fries. I just wish they had put a little more cheese and chilli so I could finish all of my fries.<//text>

One of the greatest places to eat for sandwiches & chili cheese fries. They have the best barbeque beef sandwich I have ever ate! They also make an amazing large chilli cheese fries!!! The food is really delicious & the service is fast! It can get a little busy around lunch and dinner times but it's still worth the short wait! Plenty of empty parking spots as well!!!< /Review>

< review>
I can't remember a time when The Hat wasn't a local favorite.

The food is excellent. All of it. Personally, the best is their chili-cheese fries.

I'm not exaggerating when I say I gained at LEAST 15 lbs in my mid 20's eating WAAAAAY too much chili-cheese fries with pastrami.

The Hat's Pastrami are the standard for all other Pastrami places.

Parking's just okay. Traffic in the area is terrible. But the food is worth it. It's been around for almost 70 years for a reason.< /review>

This place is awsome! The chili is great. Chili cheese tamale, chili cheese fries w/ pastrami...anything with chili is great. The portions are pretty hefty so you get your money's worth. It's a small walk up to order kinda shack, so no drive thru. This is my 3rd visit and I still haven't tried everything but so far I've had the chili cheese fries, chili tamale and the chili cheese dog. I will be back for a 4th visit to try their burger.</Review>

The food was very yummy, but a bit expensive. HOWEVER, one sandwich, one order of 🍟, and one drink was enough to feed 2 people. Great quality pastrami.<//Review>

<review>SERVICE:  I was the only customer and the person who took my order (an older man who appeared to be the manager) was not friendly at all.  However, the food was served fast and the young man who handed me my food was friendly.
PRICES:  I ordered a regular pastrami sandwich (their specialty), small fries and a medium drink.  I paid $18.36 - WOW.  I found this to be overpriced for a sandwich meal at an old walk-up fast food joint (with no indoor seating) in Alhambra.
FOOD:  The food was served hot and freshly prepared.  The sandwich was standard in size (on a standard roll), but overflowing in pastrami.  It was A LOT of pastrami. The pastrami itself was good and juicy, but nothing special.  The small/medium fries were actually extra large fries (I was given a paper lunch bag half full of fries).  The fries were thick and good, but also A LOT.  The drink (horchata) was too sugary.  I had to water down the horchata to drink it.
SUMMARY: This is an OKAY place for pastrami, but definitely not a place I would crave or make an effort to return to, especially not at those prices.<//review><rate>3<//rate><UserId.>100498024214140072069</UserId.><pics>None</pics></record>

Always a great place to try the food just don't go late at night as your food gets cold. Still would like to go during the afternoon and enjoy the  cheeseburger hamburgers they have to offer only one request if they could grill and cook the tomato for me and season it a little that would be nice. You should try it... when I'm at home and I make homemade hamburgers I always grill and season my tomatoes with lettuces its delicious just thought<//text>

< Review>
I have been here several times. The prices seem quite high given that you're essentially ordering a sandwich. I paid about $25 for two sandwiches and fries. But when you open the sandwiches, you'll find a GENEROUS portion. I ordered two pastrami dip sandwiches. And they did NOT skimp on the pastrami! So much pastrami!

The sandwich was pretty salty, however. And the fries portion was enormous! I ordered a small and it looked like they gave me enough for a party of 6. I really tried to eat as much as I could but only could eat about half of them. You definitely get what you pay for here. But I would recommend drinking tons of fluids (water, preferably) as the sodium content here is probably through the roof.< /Review>

<UserId.>101766142773357400354< /UserId.><text>The food here is decent tasting good but nothing extraordinary. What IS extraordinary are the portions. WOW! I've never eaten at The Hat so I walked up and ordered like I normally do at any burger joint. I ordered a pastrami dip for me, one for my husband, a cheeseburger for each of my two kids, an order of fries, an order of onion rings for my husband and chili cheese fries for me. They don't have meal "combos" so I figured I'd make up my own. BIG mistake lol. My hubby and I were hard pressed to finish HALF of one pastrami, much less a full one. We all picked from the chili cheese fries and still had at least half to bring home with us. We each had one or two onion rings just to taste them and sampled a fry or two as well. We ended up overstuffed and still had about 2/3 of our meal left over. Like I said, the food is typical L.A. fast food, tasty but nothing life changing but come hungry and bring someone to share with because ONE item off this menu is enough to fill you up plus have tasty leftover. FYI its is a bit pricey for fast food (all this plus four large drinks set us back $62) but keep in mind that you are paying for 3 or 4 times the normal burger joint servings. It's the perfect spot to come with a group, order a couple of items and share.< /text></record></dataset><record>

When I think West Coast pastrami, I think The Hat. The price is higher than a chain, but the portion sizes are much bigger and the food is delicious. I've only ever gotten the Pastrami Dip (pastrami on hero roll, nothing to dip in) and fries, but that's enough to keep coming back. Last I was there I saw them making chili-cheese fries and they looked so good that I may need to get some (though they look like they could feed 6 people)<//review>

Their chili cheese fries are DELICIOUS (with a huge portion). You will definitely want to share these with a friend (or more then one friend if ordering other food as well). Personally, I wasn't in love with their potato salad (but I'm picky). Their french dip roast beef sandwich is amazing as well. Be prepared, it's an eat outdoor only type of place - but it's also a quick lunch if you are looking for a delicious option in the area.< /review>

Still the go to place in SGV for hot pastrami after all these decades. Still no public toilets after all these decades. Same ok walk up sidewalk window. Seating area. Hasn't changed much in the 30 years since I went to high school. Try to stop by when I'm in So.Cal. Merging into traffic when leaving is still an adventure.< /review>

Pastrami sandwich is good and the fries are fresh. A little pricey and the order taker ignored me and waited on other people behind me. It took a long time to get my food because they work on phone orders before serving people at the counter. Worth giving a try but don't expect good service.</Text>

<Text>Hmm, overpriced. They serve a lot though, which is nice, but the onion rings I had tasted stale. On top of that, the burgers and fries were average. I might try the so-called “World Famous Pastrami” next time since so many people claim to like it...< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>The food is awesome but I had to ask for pickles & they were thinly sliced instead of cut long parallel like the location in Alhambra. The chili fries were ginormous! Couldn't even eat it all even though I tried.</Text>< Rate>

As usual the pastrami was great. Next time I will try the chilli cheese fries. It's a large portion for 2 or 3 to share.</Review>

The Hat is a San Gabriel Valley legend. I only really go there for the pastrami and chili fries, but the rest of the menu is good too. If you aren't watching your calories, order the pastrami fries (which are off menu). Outdoor seating only at this location.<//Text>

I enjoy the wet fries. That's a meal in itself. You can order the gravy on the side so that you can enjoy those fries later. Pastrami sandwich is awesome; better than any sandwich I have ever had.<//Text>

<Text>10 dollars for a beef sandwhich? I'd understand if it was stuffed. But just some sliced beef and some old tasting bread. Even the pastrami sandwich isn't worth the $10. It had a little bit more meat but still not worth it.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Two down side to this place is, one, no indoor seating.  Not a great place to eat when the weather is bad.  Two, sides are too big for one person.  Hate to waste food  but a burger with out fries doesn't seem right.</Review><date>1503308150532</date>< gmapID>

Been to a lot of "the hat" and found that this one gave me a smaller portion when ordering my chili cheese fries.  Love the pastrami sandwiches and pastrami fries and easy to share a plate when you want to bring a friend.</Text>

<text>This is the original The Hat. Known for their famous pastrami sandwich. The sandwich is to die for. Parking is great. I recommend coming with a friend and ordering a large chili cheese fries to share and having each a pastrami sandwich. That is heavan.</text><UserId.>113897244670194476441</UserId.>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The Hat has the best pastrami and chili-cheese fries ever. Sure they're super greasy, but its exactly why I love it.

My suggestion is that on any day, hot or cold, a nice pastrami will hit the spot.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c5378d99052d:0xd9cb1762718872c0< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The Hat has the best chili in town. Get the chili fries with pickles and tomatoes and you'll be in heaven. Or try the chili fries with pastrami. Their burgers are good and their pastrami dip is the best in town. I have been going here since I moved out to Los Angeles and some times you just crave The Hat. Also, if you are an onion ring aficionado you will appreciate their's, they are crunchy and perfectly browned. I really haven't gotten anything I dislike here.<//text>

I have been eating at the Hat since 1988 and have always loved it. Recently one opened in Murrieta Ca. And I must say the pastrami was terrible. I was so disappointed that I vowed to never go there again. I will only go to the ones closer to LA. Still a fan but not in Murrieta which by the way is where I live.<//Review>

I have been going to the Hat since 1958 and must say that they have the best pastrami sandwiches I have ever had. And I have tried many all over the US. Every time I'm in the San Gabriel valley I make it a,point to get off and head to the Hat. 👍❤❤❤< /review>

Yummy burgers and pastrami sandwiches.  Beware that the "pastrami dip" doesn't come with au jus to dip your sandwich,  it comes pre-dipped.  You gotta ask for it on the side. Small fries means massive bag full of fries, enjoy!</review>

The Hat, although a longstanding pastrami and burger spot, is not my cup of tea. While the location has history, the quality of the food does not warrant my business.

The pastrami is mediocre at best and not something that I would order again. Everything is pretty much mediocre to me, even the fries, which should at least be decent. But hey, everyone's tastes are different. I just have learned to go beyond reputation and care more about the quality of the food I am spending towards.<//Text>

The BEST Pastrami in the World!! Hands Down.
I grew up a few blocks away and this is the one thing I really miss. When I come back to Cali, this is my first and last stop.</Review>

The fries. Oh god the fries. They give you so many that they might as well give you a gallon of Ketchup. "Small" is huge and "large" is a freaking bathtub worth of fries.</review>

<Review>i thought the pastrami was average. but like nancy t says CHILI CHEESE FRIES are the bomb. huge portions, lots of chili. they make the fries just the way i like them, crispy and thick. (that almost sounds wrong). but it's so good. i actually am overdue for a return visit. i can't speak for anything else but now that i'm writing it i am craving fries like none other...</Review></record>

<Time>1417761177428<//Time><Review>I have been in the SGV for almost 10 years now and up until this year, had never tried The Hat. Boy that was a mistake. I LOVE IT. The pastrami sandwiches are HUGE and brimming with yummy pickles and mustard (the only way a sandwich should be in my opinion). The most recent time that I went, I got a pastrami sandwich and chili cheese fries to share with a friend. I should have known better than to assume that this was enough food to satisfy two people. It was more like a platter for 3-4. They put the chili cheese fries on top of a 4-compartment cup holder and it has a GENEROUS scoop of chili and cheese on top of the fries. I think I took 3 bites after finishing my half of the sandwich and called it quits. I need to go back and try to tame that beast one more time but this time, I'll bring more back up! >:]<//Review>< resp>

<Text>Expensive for what it worths.  The worst chili cheese fries I ever had... I came here years ago and have never gone back until 2 days ago when my 17th yrs old asked if she could try it because she has never been there... Both regret deeply :(</Text>< Pictures>

Prices slowly going up. Used to be 5 plus a sandwich. Pastrami fries still a monstrosity but something to share with a bunch of people. I prefer the pastrami here over Phillippe's beef.</review>

< Review>
The Hat, I tip my hat to thee!

If you need fries in caveman proportions, then look no further.  For The Hat, is where it's at!

The OG location that started it all, The Hat in Alhambra is an old school food stand, complete with walk-up windows for ordering & pick up, along with a covered patio dining area.  For my inaugural visit, I pondered whether to order their famous pastrami dip or go with their wet fries.  I've read how their servings of fries are quite generous, and being how I try not to eat bread, I thought an order of loaded wet fries was that particular day's calling.

Wet fries w/ added pastrami, tomatoes, pickles & mustard-
Holy crap!  It looks like a food challenge!  I thought the chatter about portions were simply hyperbole, like a tall tale being altered with exaggerations until the details became comical.  But, alas, I wasn't prepared for what lied before me.  I watched my order prepared right before my very eyes.  From thick fries fresh from the fryer, to the slathering of savory brown gravy, the addition of tender, juicy pastrami, to the addition of a pound of dill pickle slices & tomatoes, to the cherry on top being a delicious dollop of mustard, I saw the assemblage of this calorie-busting behemoth from birth to readiness graduation.  The customers after me marveled at the huge portions of my loaded wet fries being prepared, which, like a proud parent, I boasted "Yeah, that's mine."

After laying claim to a table, I dug into my gargantuan meal.  Each bite, wondrous & delightful.  The fries had the perfect thickness to handle the weight of all that smothered them.  The gravy salty & creamy.  The pastrami wonderfully fatty.  The amount of pickles seemed almost ridiculous.  After 5 minutes of going at it, the loaded wet fries seemed like I hardly put a dent in them.  They mocked me, saying "Is that the best you got, bub?"  I did my best to devour the most I could, knowing I'd have to take this monstrosity home to await it's final fate later on for dinner.

Besides the usual condiments, all you can grab whole chili peppers are a must if you're a heat lover.  They're a perfect compliment to the copious amounts of food at The Hat.

Service was good.  Ordering at the window was quick, and I didn't wait long for my fries to be ready.  Ample tables to dine at, with parking in a private lot.  The Hat is conveniently located minutes north of the 10 freeway at the intersection of Valley & Garfield.

Hunger need not show it's ugly head here.  The Hat serves ginormous amounts of food quickly for the famished masses.  I managed to finish my loaded wet fries after 2 meals.  This coming from a guy with a healthy appetite.  I'd imagine some might go a whole day to accomplish that.  Of course, sharing would be a good idea, but I'm not into that.  I want this baby all to myself.  My first visit here, and I see why The Hat is a beloved SGV institution.  If I'm in the area again, and I don't care about calories & BMI, then I'm definitely dropping by for another go at The Hat.

Highly recommend!

So I heard from people and friends I must try this place out so I did and decided to come to this location. It reminded me so much of Tommys Burgers because its at the corner of both busy mainstreets. So the menu of this place didnt surprise me as much as I thought it would but for its price its cheap. So I decided to order the BBQ Beef Pastrami here and a side of onion rings. The moment you bit the Pastrami Beef BBQ sandwich all I tasted was the BBQ. It felt like there was no meat here :/ and the sauce its self has overwhelmed the beef by 90%. But other than that the onion rings did not dissapoint me they were worth buying it cost $4 something and were given alot in the bag. Other than that this place was a good experience next time Ill just order the regular pastrami sandwich instead.< /review>

My little Brother Steve (RIP Steve)  and I got a pastrami every time we went to the Theatre across the st, I think The Garfield. They were on a French roll , piled high, then drenched in gravy, cost 65 CENTS. The pool at Granada Park was 20 cents; we earned $ 2 to cut lawns. Best sandwhich in my 71 years. That was 1951 / 52, moved from Alhambra in 1961, boo hoo. My friend ( Butch Rozelle ) , pushed me off the wall around the Castle ( where Phil Spector killed Lana Clarkson years later ) I was semi-conscious for awhile; awoke 3 days later to find the Rozelle's had left town....

Beat pastrami sandwich I've found anywhere.
Pro tip, a small fry is the size of 10 large Fry's from any other place.</text>

I used to come here when they didn't have giant chili cheese fries with tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, onions and PASTRAMI on top. I used to have to ask them to make a special order like that and they used to pile the pastrami high. Now they use a baby cup to measure the amount of pastrami. This is still the item to order at THE HAT. Make sure you share this one, cause it's damn big!<//Text>
