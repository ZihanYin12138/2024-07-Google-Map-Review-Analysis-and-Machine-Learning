I have done 6 houses now with the toughlock vinyl flooring and I love it. Its easy to lay because its all in one and the tenants can't hurt it by mopping with water. It has a very high end look to it so you don't get the impression that it's a rental property.< /Review>

I walked into this store to get a carpet estimate. I said I'd come back to purchase the carpet before I  sold my house. I told the salesman I had spilled a glass of red wine on my carpet and pouring salt on the spot did not remove the stain. He suggested using oxiclean. WALA!!  AMAZINGLY IT WORKED.  I'll check it in daylight tomorrow. I just can't believe it. I'd do business with these people in a heartbeat.  Thanks guys.</Review>

Walked in and greeted by extremely friendly staff. Asked by employees multiple times if we had any questions and if there was anything they could assist with. Both were very helpful and extremely knowledgeable on what kind of flooring I would be needing for my specific project. Got a few samples of some flooring as well.</Review>

This business does not stand behind their warranties. They sold me engineered hardwood flooring for a high traffic kitchen/living area, representing it would last 25 years. Less than 6 years later, it looks awful. And they claim warranty does not apply, because it is "normal wear and tear." Total rip-poff!<//Review>

<review>Chico took my order while I had a flurry of activity and sounds going on behind me.  I am surprised he hung in there with me but he was professional, courteous and a good problem solver.  The CC company declined the charge even though we had plenty of credit and he helped me navigate through that mess. Gave me his cell to call back so I could get the order placed since it was now after hours.  THANK YOU CHICO!  I really needed to get the flooring ordered and you made it easy!</review><UserId.>115797454709992615072</UserId.>< date>

We had a great experience with Flooring Liquidators in Fresno. After getting an incredibly overpriced quote from Lowe’s, FL helped us quickly and easily accomplish our goals (not the salesmen’s) of installing new carpet so we could sell our house.

The salesmen Chris was super professional and Robert the guy who measure the house was incredibly helpful, offering suggestions for how to accomplish our goals while saving on unnecessary upgrades.

We will definitely use them again in our new home. I highly recommend them<//Text>

Don't do business with Floor Liquidator big promise not deliver. This people is on a piece rate and they will do anything for a sale. The end result is cheap product and unfinished work by their subcontractor. Over estimate on products and cheap materials not the ones you see when you visit the store. They recycle your old stuff even though they quote that they will replace with new one. I highly recommend anyone not do any business with them.<//Text>

< review>
This place uses shady sales tactics. We went in looking for hardwood flooring. They added a LOT of square footage to my estimate and were dismissive when I asked them about it. I went back and measured everything myself to show them and suddenly they "lost" the diagram the estimator had drawn up. This place is also NOT a liquadator; they are just a regular old retailer. We needed just barely over 200 square feet of floor underlay and they were going to make us buy a full 300 square feet. If they were a real liquadator they would just sell the extra to someone else. And their claims to be lower priced than other places is complete garbage. We found the same stuff at Lowes for cheaper, with the same labor cost.<//review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>This place is really close to where I live and I wanted to give something new a shot.  Worst burrito I've had in SoCal.  Got three different burritos for a friend and I - California Burrito, Carne Asada Burrito, Pollo Asada Burrito.  All 3 tasted like they had been sitting for several hours under a heat lamp, extremely dry and lacking flavor.  The burritos were also like $10 a piece and not nearly as large as Sayulitas. I hope others don't have the same experience but that's what happened for me.< /text>< Pics>

First time here. Tried the sausage breakfast burrito. Really good! They use boiled potatoes instead of French fries, which I prefer. They also use vegetable oil instead of lard. Since my cholesterol is a little on the high side, it's better for me. Don't get me wrong I like the flavor of Mexican food when lard is used.</Text>

Tried a bacon breakfast burrito and carne asada burrito, both seemed fresh and were prepared well.  Both were were pretty much what you would expect from a San Diego taco shop flavor wise, prices were a little higher than my normal places, $5 for the breakfast burrito and a drink (current special) and around $7 for the carne asada.

The help yourself salsa bar included pickled carrots and a great green sauce that I think had avocado in it, and was very clean.< /review>

The burrito was good but they instead gave me a ham and cheese quesadilla. Which isn't good., the ham tastes and looks like they bought it at the dollar store, my receipt also said carne asada quesadilla. Not impressed.</text>< UserId.>

< Review>
Has changed owners, and the food is top notch. It is now owned by the same people that own Freidas tacos in Chula Vista. They recently started doing the tacos outside on a grill, so even better in my opinion. Their Agua frescas are made fresh every day from scratch. No mixes. And always 4 different options in the Aguas. And those change their flavors every other day. So always something new to try.<//Review>

Great local place at a great price.

It serves great California burritos and has great salsa fresco with its chips as well.  Food is made fresh to order.  Highly recommend if you are a local in the area.<//Text>

Haven’t had Birriah de res that good since Jalisco Mexico, don’t order the thing that looks like a Gordita, it’s for ppl who like Taco Bell it’s like a crunch wrap supreme, not real Mexican, but the queso taco is awesome and the best meat to order on whatever you get is the adobada.</review>

This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in escondido, the burritos are big juicy and freshly made every time. Seriously I choose this one over any of the fast food places when it comes to burritos and tacos.</Text>

Mexican food at this location - very good. Got there about three, it wasn't crowded. Certainly worth a return trip. This place has a nice design. Atmosphere is like a restaurant in Fort Worth I loved.</text>

<text>The food is BOMB! They make everything on the spot which is why it takes a bit but well worth it. My kids are picky eaters but they love it here. Employees are really friendly and take the time to come out to see how everything is going with your meal. Downside is the parking but again it's worth it for the food.</text>< UserId.>

The food was excellent but there is only 1 cook doing all the preparation.   On Sunday it was too busy to wait for 40 minutes for a bean and cheese burrito. I will not go there again.</Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>The lady tried to rip me off and keep my change. She told me it would be a certain amount and then i asked her for my change and she told me it was tax too and that she didnt add that in. She changed the price as i was looking at their board. Not only that but she was rude. I even tipped them before she pulled this. Good food is 1 thing honesty and customer service is another. They go hand in hand. Its sad people treat others like they are dumb. I told her it doesn't we matter. A lie is a lie and stealing is stealing. I wont ever go there again. And i just opened up my food and its disgusting. Unbelievable.</Review>< pics>

The menudo is great, the food rations are plentiful, and the customer service is welcoming.< /Text>

The customer service at the California Mexican Restaurant was top notch and excellent.  Its a hole in the wall place.  The food was great tasting, well seasoned and reasonable pricing.  Parking over there can be a little tricking but worth going to this place for the authentic Mexican food.  The carne asada burrito is my favorite.</Review>

Good food, terrible treatment of employees as they do not appear to be flexible with them. No wonder they always have a help wanted sign outside, because people are always leaving.</text>

(Translated by Google) Nothing spectacular, if you remember when you bought tacos in a corner, in Mexico, but they don't have much flavor, the roasted meat is very dry and the marinated meat is very fatty, which the lemon gave it a solution ...
Anyway, more or less

(Original)
Nada espectacular, si te llega el recuerdo de cuando comprabas tacos en una esquina, en México, pero no tienen mucho sabor, la carne asada muy seca y la adobada muy grasosa, cosa que el limón le dio solución...

The worst place to eat supposedly Mexican food. Tacos roles have no meat (it is pure omelette) and the other tacos have no flavor. They smell of pure choquia and old meat. I don't eat here again.

<review>My cat had an ongoing eye infection which caused him to have 105.3 fever. I took him to my regular vet and felt the diagnosis was wrong. I thought i was going to lose him. After my vet got his fever under control i called and explained the issues with Erik. I was so concerned because the infection was back again after 2 weeks of medication. Erik assured me he would do everything he could to find an appointment for me. He was concern and compassionate. I was so impressed with his professionalism. Its not something you get much these days. He got me and appointment and my cat was diagnosed and is still in ongoing treatment but i am convinced by the staff's efforts my sweet cat is in the best hands. Thank you for the excellent care.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1624851722753, 'text': "That's fantastic to hear! The whole team thanks you for your great feedback!

<Review>My 6 month old puppy has cherry eye. I booked a non-urgent appointment for several weeks out, and all seemed fine. However, it quickly developed to his pupils being different sizes from each other and a loss of appetite. My primary care vet was concerned and recommended I ask if I could move his April appointment up due to the urgent nature of the symptoms and her not knowing what was going on.

The front desk person was incredibly rude when I called and kept asking what was the diagnosed emergency despite me clearly saying we didn’t know and describing his symptoms. He then asked if I was “just saying this to get an earlier appointment”. Like I would want to pay a bunch of money and fake my puppy having eye problems for fun?

I made an appointment with Vision Care for Animals instead, and was able to get an urgent appointment much sooner with a very caring front desk person.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f98ab5257487d:0xcf01ef1c94326a90< /Gmap_id></record>

Total scam. My puppy had a scratch on his cornea and I needed to see a specialist. Anthony told me they were booked out but I could “schedule an emergency” tor a $500 fee. That’s not an emergency, that’s a scam. Basically that that means is VIPs/rich people’s pets are more important than the rest of our pets. Emergencies shouldn’t be scheduled. They happen.  Again, they’re just offering VIP appts for an extra $500 and calling them emergencies. It’s a total scam. Anthony didn’t mention the other 4 clinics in the bay, but told me I could go to UC Davis. He literally said “yeah so your options are pay $500 or drive to Davis.”

Talk about compassion for animals.  They don't care about animals, they just care about money.</review>

One of our dogs has had a series of eye problems. Veterinary Vision saved her eye and has provided excellent care since then (couple of years). They are expert, kind, caring, flexible and not terribly expensive. Worth every penny!<//text>

Appreciate the customer service, quick appointments and the veterinarian. Appointments were quick and painless. Deducted one start for med refills outside appts. Called twice to get refills that never happened. Finally got them from regular veterinarian< /review>

<Review>These guys are great. I have brought a total of 5 of my pets here and we are all treated really well. I love Dr. Mughannam! I remember Monique from my very first interaction with Vet Vision. Personable and communicated effectively. What can't I say? If you need top quality opthamalogy service for your pet, these guys are it. Though they recently joined with Sage Veterinary Services and prices have gone up, it is worth the money.

<text>It was a mistake to bring my pet to this hospital. I though they are specialists, but I don't think so. End up paid a lots and have bad experience. Never recomand and go back again.
Last Friday, I received email from this clinic.

I am so glad Cooks retire. There will be no more aminals to suffer cruelly under her blade. This Vets and nurse and aims for money only. Their knowledge is worse than a regular people.
For example, If I had a stomachache, go to hospital, and the Dr said you have to surgery open the stomach. It doesn't make sense ?? Not even take X-Ray or lab test.

It will be better if the nurse layoff as well because they will scare you by saying that: if you don't do surgery, you pet will blind.

If you love your pet and don't want them to suffer, please pay attention to this Cooks< /text>< pictures>

<text>Dr. Lynch was amazing! Her staff is incredible! She did my cat's eye surgery and she did a beautiful job. I would trust her to do my eyes if needed. For years I was terrified to have my cat undergo this procedure for her entropy, until I met Dr. Lynch. She was very thorough and, unlike other doctors I had seen about this problem, she was honest. Also, not that money was a huge issue considering my pet's happiness, but she was almost half the price of other doctors in a 50 mile range.  My cat is so happy now. I wish I could give more stars!<//text>< pictures>

<Review>I am a general practice vet and chose to take my dog here for an intense eye issue requiring a specialist.  They were courteous and fit me in a week early since I had messed up the appointment and arrived on the wrong day. They did a good work up at a good price.  I advise my clients take their pets here for ocular issues.<//Review>< date>

< Review>
Very dissatisfied w/ this clinic that I didn’t even get to come too. I was quoted 200+ for just to have my puppy checked.. and I didn’t mind paying that... but the lady stated they would charge me 100+ more for fitting me in for the same service!!!!! Luckily I found a diff. Location!!  That did not try taking Advantage of the situation! They’re selfish!!</Review>

<review>One of the best places to get menudo! Properly cooked and made tender while keeping it's succulent flavor. The broth is flavorful, yet not too oily. My long time favorite spot for Sunday breakfast.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPujoIfveZh1Q0GYXv6m5CoDFRn-nVAIL0dwJ69=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORZOC51NLjFlGv-X7naOlE87VfQQdyB2Bnp2N5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80e84e81f658c76b:0x27c64044d89db538</gmap_id></record>

<Text>This small restaurant in downtown Oxnard has the best homemade tortillas I've ever tasted. I ordered the chilaquiles and the meal was served with beans and rice and two eggs on top. I mixed it all together and with the fresh corn tortillas it was Amazing.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80e84e81f658c76b:0x27c64044d89db538<//gmap_id><Date>1576876577494<//Date>< userid>

The Carne tasted as if it was previously cooked and warmed in a microwave. Very greasy. Not worth the price at all. The meat in the hardshell tacos was undercooked and had cartilage in it. Very disappointed because I used to come here with my Mom when I was younger. Will not be coming back.< /Text>

Very welcoming and sanitary. Equipment was cleaned before and after usage. Jodi was amazing in explaining my eye concerns and issues being detailed and attentive. Additionally the staff was great, they helped me pick new glasses and lens based on my needs. Quick with high quality. Will be going back for sure!< /review>

<review>Dr. Jodi Shepard is my new go optometrist! Extremely knowledgeable, friendly, efficient, and uses the latest state of the art technology. She proactively shared information with me that will help my eye health over the long term, things that I did not hear from other optometrists in the past. It was clear to me she loves the work she does and truly cares for her patients. Such a great experience.<//review><Rating>5< /Rating><Time>1623699463487<//Time><user>114776132293729410950</user><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
Dr. Shepard is excellent at her profession.  Not only did she show me how significant my eye clarity can be with the latest info/equipment she had, she also gave me a fair chastisement on how my ambivalent attitude towards my high blood pressure can lead to disconcerting disabilities.   When one thinks of a heart attack or stroke, they tend to think of death, but she made me aware that high BP would most likely affect things like sight first, and a stroke isn’t necessarily fatal, but can lead you to paralysis or other issues that could take away the independence one felt they lived by.   We don’t think of going in for an eye-checkup would lead to refilling a prescription for high BP, but there you go, it did.   Thank you so much for you professional care</Review>

She gave me so much information about my diabetes and how to help get it in control. She explained the effect diabetes has on the eyes.

I always have the best experience when I see Dr. Shepard and her staff. They’re all so attentive and helpful, always going above and beyond to provide the best experience possible. What I like the most is they’re the type of people who say they will do something and ACTUALLY do it. I have never had to follow up with them because they always stick to their promises!

Dr. Shepard herself is so sweet and caring. She’s very passionate about what she does and speaks to her profession in a way that makes you appreciate the beauty of it. She’s so personable that it always feels like I’m chatting with a good friend. I recommend her and her staff a thousand times!<//Review>

Everything went really good and I truly appreciate Dr. Shepard taking time out to consul me on my overall health. I also appreciate Jessika on the front end counter with her professional guidance on selecting the most appropriate frames for me. The young man that ran the test was very professional as well and he clean all areas that we used righr in front of me. That really was a plus for me.
Thank you all for a wonderful experience at your place.<//text>

Dr. Shepard and her staff at Lenscrafters are amazing! Dr. Shepard availed herself on a busy Saturday afternoon, when I was experiencing allergy eye and irritation.  She discovered that I actually had scratch on my cornea. She wrote me a prescription and asked that I schedule a follow-up appointment.  The staff is always kind and helpful.  This office exceeded my expectations.  Great job!! Thank you!!<//Review>

<Text>Doctors Jodi Shepard, is friendly, enthusiastic, and kind. Her exams are above and beyond and informative. I learned a lot about the importance of Eyexam’s in my first visit with Doctor Jodi and I highly recommend you schedule your next appointment with her.<//Text><username>Alexis Jones</username></record>

Seeing everything being controlled by an IPad instead of the old Batman looking thing on my face for the eye test and combine with Dr. Shepard’s expertise made my visit more 100% sure that I made the right choice coming in. Was happy that she can promise me a 20/20 vision with the new glasses.<//text>< pics>

The staff was very knowledgeable of each of their performed tasks. Each staff member took the time to explain what they were going to do,which made feel at ease. Every staff member was very friendly which again made me feel relaxed and confident I would get the best care and product. By the way Lens Crafters has some state of the art equipment to get the job done in a short period of time.<//Text>

<username>Brett & Patti Butler</username><date>1567794335793< /date><Review>I did not feel heard by Dr. Shepard during my appointment.  There was this huge download of information from her to me and when I tried to tell her why I was there, she interrupted me and assumed to understand my issue, and explained why I just didn't know how to wear my glasses, while never truly listening to my need or struggle.  She jumped to conclusions multiple times throughout the visit.  At the end, She began to write a new prescription for more progressives, I had to stop her and say NO I want single vision reader glasses, and single vision driving glasses.  She only gave me a script for readers, she assumed she understood how I would be using them and determined the distance I needed them, without ever consulting me and how I read, work and do needlework.    She told me to use my current progressives to drive because that is HER preference for driving.

I am now afraid to get my prescription filled, I have no assurance that it is what I need.

This is the second visit I have had with Dr. Shepard, the first visit I had the same exact experience and have a very expensive pair of glasses I will never use.

My husband & I will not be returning to Lenscrafters and Dr Shepard at the Southland Mall.  We will be looking for another provider.<//Review>< rating>

Dr. Shivani was very knowledagble, and took the time to extensively explain all relevant aspects relating to my optic health. I appreciated her kindness and patience, and how personalized she made the experience. I was greeted very warmly by staff. I have been going to the Hayward Lenscrafter location for over 10 years, and will continue to do so.<//text>

It has literally been years since I've had an eye exam, so needless to say I was a little nervous making an appointment. I was able to get an appointment within 5 days of scheduling!  This was my first time going to the Lenscrafters at the Southland Mall. The staff at  the desk were friendly and welcoming. They were very thorough with their paperwork and got me in to do my exam withing a few minutes. I felt very comfortable with the woman that did my exam. After a few test and notes I was walked to a room to wait for Dr. Monica Liou. Right away I could tell that she was very passionate about her work and took time explaining to me how my insurance benefits worked. After a few minutes talking with her she let me know that I still had very strong vision and wouldn't need glasses. She informed me how often I should return for my next exam. Dr. Monica Liou was very kind and took the time to ask me if I had any other questions. This establishment is top notch and I am definitely returning and referring!</Text>

Great service. Sergio knew his stuff and was willing to work with me. I called past their normal business hours, but he was willing to wait for me to get there (about ten minutes). Took about 15 minutes, will definitely take my vehicles back.</text>

Good prices, waiting room is clean and comfortable with beverages available, and the staff is very helpful and trustworthy! I will continue to take my family's cars here for smog checks! Also, a side point: the company is under new ownership, so older reviews might not be relevant.</Review>

Jessica at this bakery is really helpful, this bakery is the closest in authenticity to Salvadorean bread compared to other bakeries I frequented in the pass.
Every chance I get I continue to buy from them for my church and for my gamily.<//text>

True Salvadorian Bakery in La Puente. They have all sorts of Salvadorian products. Their pupusas are good. The only reason I give it a 3 is the counter person was a little rude. But the food is a 5... and the baked goods is a 10.</Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Over the years I've ordered cakes in this facility. I've never had a problem receiving my order. But throughout these past months they started with horrible service. Today May 14, 2017 I ordered a cake and the guy that received my call asked for my name and phone number. I said I'll be there at 4 PM and when I arrived asking for my order I get a surprise that they sold the cake! Instead of offering an apology the baker starts attending other customers and ignores you. They now lost a customer I'm never buying anything here again. For those who buy bread be careful alot of flies are in the bread and once I told the guy and instead of removing it he just simply said "oh well bad luck to whoever buys and eats it" I wish a health inspector would visit soon this facility has gone very bad! Don't recommend.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2d66c91ab33ad:0xa3cd1c5218a92315< /Gmap_id></record>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>(Translated by Google) If I could give it 0 stars that would give it.
I don't know how they dare to sell food if it doesn't even taste like it. The tamales are lousy, the bread is stale, cold, and expensive. The quesadillas have no taste of quesadilla, and expensive too.
The cashier has a bad attitude, bitter, rude, I will never return to this place.
I do not recommend it to anyone. And apart from all of the above .... DIRTY.
NOTHING 🚫 RECOMMENDED

(Original)
Si pudiera darle 0 estrellas eso le daría.
No sé cómo se atreven a vender comida si nisiquiera sabor tiene, Los tamales malísimos, el pan duro, frio, y caro, Las quesadillas no tienen nada de sabor a quesadilla, y caras también.
La cajera tiene mala actitud, amargada, grosera, jamás volveré a este lugar.
No se lo recomiendo a nadie. Y aparte de todo lo anterior....SUCIO.

The were so proud that the owner brought by a very pretty vase of flowers for them! I am happy they recognize how special they are!<//review>< Pics>

<Text>I was a walk-in customer and waited less than 30 minutes. My stylist, Lana, was savvy and did the haircut I wanted. It turned out great! Best haircut I've had in a long time. She even suggested the perfect hair product for my hair type. Definitely will return here. She and another stylist, Helen, were great! ☺❤</Text><rate>5<//rate><name>Debra Caton</name><GmapID>0x80945f2cb3896d33:0xa2246cc0b81200c4< /GmapID>< userid>

<review>The staff are so friendly and accommodating.  If you go home and find that you want something changed you can go back same day or next and they will work on your hair again for free!  Adult cut was only $16 which is a wonderful bonus for a great cut and wonderful staff.<//review>< pics>

This is  the WORST place in Fresno to get a haircut.  I  used several different beauticians and everyone is equally bad. I was scalped. I had to wear a cap in public to hide my scalp.< /text>

A bald patch, uneven cut, terrible customer service and a staff of very low talent "stylist" that will huff and puff throughout your experience.  My stylist was the uninspired Irma who couldn't handle doing a routine scissor trim on my comb over style and my son sat with Maria, whom botched his hair.  Seriously let him walk away with a bald patch and an uneven cut on top.  No blending, no style.

You can have a much better cut and be treated like a much better at many other shops.  My son and I have been coming here for routine cuts these past few years but never again.

Thanks for ruining our hair Great Clips!

Spend your $16 elsewhere.< /Review>

Sometimes the right length, sometimes your stylist keeps cutting to get even length and you walk out with a man cut.
I found someone there that does an xlnt haircut and I gave a tip because I was do pleased.  She complained about salary there which I know understand. I called to make an appointment and was told by another that they don't know who is showing until that day because they call and schedule each day.  That's horrible if true.  Sets up bad moral and bad moral can equal bad haircuts, right?<//text><UserId.>111619502126887437277< /UserId.><Rating>3</Rating>< Pictures>

This T-mobile is not cooperate owned.  In my opinion that makes it push the sale of accessories harder.  Takes a long time to get anything done here too.  Whatever they are doing on the computers slows everything down alot.  Bring a chair or go to a different store.< /text>

Always delicious.
However, sometimes they forget my bacon ("...and of course bacon and mayo") unless I ask for it = small price to pay for a good sandwich!< /Text>

Yum! Great everything! One of my favorite spots in the city! Tea leaf salad is foolproof, order vegetarian if you don't want fried shrimp in it. Platha dipper also never dissappoints and Samusa soup is delicious!!</Review>

Holy cow, our Italian sub was nothing short of absolutely phenomenal... My husband and I shared the Large size and we absolutely loved it- it was outstanding!! It got crazy busy in this place, but the staff remained cool and collect and make sure that all of everyone's needs were met! We are thrilled to have such an efficient Jersey Mike's near our place.< /text>

The other two employees kept one pair on for the duration I was there, and they alternated between all three stations (grill, cashier, and sandwich prep).< /Review>< Pictures>

This place is the worst. I am a delivery driver and on several occasions have I have been dispatched to this location only to arrive and have my order not even started. They don't make the sandwiches until their line clears, which won't happen during lunch time. I have waited a full hour before, only to leave when they STILL haven't started. Today I waited 40 minutes after the order was placed. When I went up to the counter to check a second time, the same person who I checked in with when I arrived didn't remember me, even though he'd told me it would be "a few minutes" 20 minutes prior. I was told it would be at least another 20 minutes, no apologies. I don't get paid to wait so I re-assigned the order. You would never make an in store customer wait this long. Don't accept app delivery orders if you don't have the time to fulfill them or train your staff better. When the food is inevitably late, the customer will blame me even though it has nothing to do with me. Treat delivery drivers like actual customers - we go out to eat too and I don't spend my money at establishments that have this attitude.<//text>

I go to this Jersey Mike's weekly for my staple (chicken cheesesteak with avocado). It is all in the staff there; they are quick, efficient and courteous. They never mess up my special order, it is always ready when it is supposed to be and they do everything with a smile. Keep up the good work.</Text>

<Review>There was a very long line to order, and once I did I was disappointed in the very limited vegetarian options. I ordered a veggy wrap, I was very pleased with the unique tortillas they offered for it. It was just vegetables, mostly sweet peppers and onions, with cheese inside a tortilla and it cost me almost $10. The food was great, but not worth that price for what it was. Because of that I won't be coming here again.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>I love the #9 Club Supreme with turkey, roast beef, cheese, bacon, mayo and of course Mike's way with onions, lettuce, tomatoes, vinegar n oil and seasoning n salt n pepper.  I prefer less a little bit of the shredded lettuce and ask for dressing on the lettuce instead of on the tomatoes which doesn't soggy the bread.  Also I ask for extra tomatoes.  This is more like Deanna's way.  So delicious.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>I am a sandwich lover of no small degree. Jersey Mike's is my favorite sandwich shop by even a greater proportion. To give you an idea of how many times I enjoyed their sandwiches, I've taken advantage of their frequent incentive program (where you earn a free sandwich) over a dozen times! Jersey Mike reminds me of the 'good ole days' in Ohio, where my folks would take us to the local deli where the bread was outrageously delicious, the meet was hand sliced right before you, plied high and airy, the lettuce was thinly sliced, the condiments were freshly cut and amply applied, the spices where just right, and the price was low enough to drop by frequently. Jersey Mikes is all this and more. My fave is #13 (the ultimate sub), prepared "Mike's Way." If you plan to take your sandwich home and not devour at once, I suggest taking home the oil & vinegar and applying it just before you eat. Not doing so risks creating soggy bread. That aside, there simply is no better sandwich shop in all of Orange County.<//Text></record>

Excellent subway sandwiches with no prepackaged meat. Higher quality than Subway and better than Togos. Small seating area, but clean with friendly people. Excellent reward program to earn free food. And the Sobe diet grapefruit drink is outstanding.</text>

So recently came here to get my inspection done. Wasn’t my first pick due to location but I was in the neighborhood due to work and I needed it done ASAP. Called and was quoted a cheaper price compared to other locations. So I went and they started the inspection process. They called me over to show me that my front rotors were bad and my brake pads unfortunately were not ceramic pads which lead to them damaging my rotors. They replace what was need and I was out the door. Totally professional and great customer service. Not to mention the total understanding of financial problems ppl go through they did what they could to help me out. Definitely going to be my mechanics from now on. Thanks guys</Text>

One 4 brakes) 2 get my vehicle 2 pass inspection @ the dmv. $80.00 per certificate. Front brakes & rotors had 2 b replaced. U can find another place cheaper & with a coupon.

This place was absolutely wonderful, got our break and light inspection done here. Their service was fast, kind and very professional. We were given a coupon so it was only 80 dollars for the full inspection but we paid 100 with the extra 20 being a tip. Overall will come again if I need any work done< /text>

Took my Honda Civic in for a brake and light inspection employees were very friendly and informative.I went in knowing I had a bad headlight bulb mechanics replaced it and passed my inspection and then headed across the street to the DMV. I will recommend this place for anybody looking for the dmv brake and lamp inspection.</Review>

Lately in the last 3 months I have been in there atleast 5 times. The first time ... there was hardly anything in there... I thought they were closing. The last several times that  I actually bought something and returned. I felt the cashiers were rude and rushed even though the line was never too long. No customer service at all. I did get a good sale once and the store is stocked again so I gave 2 stars. Not my favorite Ross at all. I rather shop elsewhere and give my money to nice friendly service.<//review>

However I was looking for men's pants and basically they only have blue jean and active pants. Only about a 5-foot section of men slacks. I was disappointed because I went there specifically for men's slacks. I got some coffee syrup flavorings that was looking for and that was it.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXDDUc35NH14Vqvox7ukrjsl7V2ecIhuSAm7DE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiHnBq5DWSfjYzsv6ld-lBSqPRwmwDFb-ANwj3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2fZXa-PC6Rd5K6SBIBp3zVMCqeyW0lLFUlGlh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

What can you say. Well done. They are in there own league. They sell alot of different goods. To shop their is a pleasure. You never know quite you are going to get. Price, the right price. Quality goods. Over broad lines of goods. You quite know what you will find. But you will leave happy. With extra $$$$ in your pocket. It can go a long way in today's world. I truly enjoy the stores. Good shopping to all.< /Text>

This store is mostly well stocked, especially in the designer section. Calvin Klein and other branded bags and clothes are available in plenty. Checkout line was empty when we were there on a Sunday night.</review>

I really was happy shopping there, the only thing I think should be changed is that some of the jewelry displays you could see them until you checked out an walking out the door I saw a few that I wanted but didn't want to go back an wait in a long line again .it would be nice to be able to see it before checking out, but other than that I was pleased<//Text>

The very last day before they close due to the virus I bought the piece of small furniture for my bathroom for $49 it did not fit where I wanted it
it' sat in my car for 3-4 months somehow the receipt got lost.
it was and my credit card they could have found it, they still had 4 more of the same thing for the same price in the store but they offered me 49 cents!
that is not Acceptable that is robbery I am so upset with them that I will never never go there again😡☹<//text>

As far as I'm concerned when a department store is more concerned about saving a little water and a little toilet paper than it is about selling me hundreds of dollars worth of clothing and shoes then it must want me to shop somewhere else. And I'm going to oblige them. It's clear that all the Ross stores have taken on this stance of pretending that their restroom is out of order. They don't even have the courage to Simply say that they don't have a restroom for their shoppers. Well Ross let me tell you something when older women and people with small children come to your store they are going to expect to use the restroom and if they cannot they are going to shop elsewhere.< /Text><name>TheOne Anjel</name>< Date>

This store has some super hot deals, just search all over for them. Seems really clean and the staff are very helpful. The place is organized too, which is a rare find in this type of discounted store. Definitely recommended</review><userid>110690810232805622434<//userid><Date>1552697215751<//Date>< pictures>

<Review>About 6 mos.ago  came to the store this particular branch while shopping a call of nature i asked van i use your Restroom ? Quicker than lightning  : sorry its out of order" After 6 mos past. Comeback   to  buy a  skillet then call of nature  again  i asked if i could use the Restroom & i was told the RESTROOM IS OUT OF ORDER AGAIN . WHATS WRONG WITH YOUR RESTROOM ?ALL THE TIME IS OUT OF ORDER ? OR ITS THE MANAGEMENT HAS THE PROBLEM WITH THE TOILET . WHILE I WAS TALKING TO  SO CALLED   MGR.
I WAS THAT WALLGREENS HAD  A RESTROOM THAT I COULD USE. ( PATHETIC)   .THIS PARTICULAR STORE I WILL NOT RECOMMEND  TO NOBODY . ITS ILLEGAL  FOR ESTABLISHMENT LIKE THIS THAT THERE IS NO RESTROOM  TO BE USE BY THE BUYING PUBLIC. & MOST TIME.< /Review>< Pics>

The manager was really great. The styles and the prices were too good to let pass. I basically found all the pieces I needed to big up my wardrobe. Yea, they have simple, well tailored, individual pieces, as well as, stunning little show stoppers! I will go there again to find new fashion statements which also fill in the gaps in my Spring wardrobe.                                          Peace, Regan 🌈 from NorCal< /Text>

<Review>This Ross store was clean and there was no line and three cashiers. What? Yes, I was very surprised too and I had a good shopping 🛒 experience here. All the employees including the fitting room checker were very helpful and nice. I normally have no luck finding things for myself but this day was different, I walk out with an outfit. 👚👖🧦👟<//Review><Name>Sandra Rosas Olden<//Name><gmap_id>0x808e34c3c84b112d:0x8c341a5190e59569< /gmap_id>< user_id>

I guess it isn't always like this, but today was a horrific day there. Firstly, my mom shopped there for 1 hour, so I guess that counts as good. But then when she finally decided to check out, we discovered that there was only one cashier there, and there was a long line. The manager came to help, but he didn't know how to do it! And all the other employees were super busy with some other stuff, so my mom rolled her eyes and said,"this is gonna take forever, let's go." So we went with nothing bought. I know that all days aren't all like this, but I'm just warning you, there are days like this. Ciao!</text>

I found just the type of purse,I needed and wanted. In my price range. I would have liked it a bit cheaper but,the style, color was just what I desired.  Cashier, was polite and nice.</Review>

<review>Great inventory, very organized and clean.
It seemed as though my friend and I were being watched very closely though (we are Black) , and the security made it his job to come talk to us as if he needed to make his presence more known - like we were up to something. That was followed by a passive aggressive checkout interaction. :-/</review>< rate>

Terrible management. I reported to the manager about a rude employee and he just brushed it off as if my report wasn't valid. He didn't apologize or anything. Won't be shopping here again.</text>

Economic stuff... this time the Perry Ellis shoes did not last a month. Both soles broke. They do not accept the returns. And when I went in the place was super messy and dirty.</text>

<review>You got small money? You can load up on cheap flimsy plastic/fake stuff. The clothing is cheap quality - one or two washes and no longer what you bought. Pretty much all cheap bottom barrel. I bought fraud cologne that was labeled as being the real thing - I attempted to get my money back but the management said "too bad, it's opened, bye-bye".< /review><rating>1<//rating>< pictures>

Store is messy. Fitting room doors don't stay closed and they are not clean. Staff does not greet customers or make eye contact. Poor service.</review>

It's an inexpensive place to shop, the store was pretty clean, hard to find clothing because nothing is in order, and you have to deeply look at things, for inperfections, besides that, it's a cool place to shop and you can find good deals< /review>
