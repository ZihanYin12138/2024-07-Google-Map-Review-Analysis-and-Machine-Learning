< review>
The service was excellent, they were really fast and responsive of my phone order. I also wanted some recommendation about what to order and they were very helpful in that regard. T And the food however is just so so. I got an everything bagel with tuna salad on it, the tuna salad just didn’t really have much of a taste… And really just didn’t have much tuna salad on a bagel. It had other veggies on it to which were decent but it was just a weird taste. I also got the everything bagel with egg and cheese, and they just didn’t put any salt on the eggs which do you think would’ve been OK with the cheese, in terms of salt content, but it just tasted like nothing. The everything bagels themselves were just too chewy.</review>

I grab breakfast from this place every time I'm in town - there's nothing overly special about it, but it has a good menu of breakfast bagels and they're fantastic every time. It seems pretty popular too, there's almost always a line.</Review>

<review>Asian lady working here not friendly if you are person of color. Very unwelcoming towards me as opposed to the white customers. I did order two bagels sandwiches which were okay. I live close by and want to support local businesses especially during COVID but they still find time to discriminate.Subways and Homeplate next door are much better with friendlier service.</review>< response>

<text>Great breakfast here!  This is the closest spot to my office and I stop in occasionally stop in for breakfast and lunch.

The sandwiches are decent, my only complaint is the use of microwaves to heat up meats and cheeses.   The price is a little expensive for what they give you.

Staff is quiet, but never rude.  The food comes out pretty quick, but it's always a grab and go due to no where to sit.</text></record>

<Review>Cheap coffee. Lots of flavors. Bagels were standard. Prices were low for the city. Good service. No customer or public bathrooms available. Lots of bagel sandwich options. We had the breakfast bagel which was mushrooms were a little off. Very similar to Posh Bagel or other quick lunch spots in the city. Probably won't be back unless in the area and need really cheap coffee.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>If your a Bagel person like me, these bagels are subpar. (Especially for the Price) I asked for a Bacon, Egg & Cheese and the cashier charged me for an Omelette Bagel. The Bagels are very bland and I witnessed the Barista pour pre-mixed eggs and Heat it up in the MICROWAVE!!! hahahaaa To top it off the Bacon was stale, like it'd been out for a few days. For the price I paid, I could've gotten the SAME Bacon, Egg & Cheese Bagel + Iced Coffee @ PANERA BREAD down the street on 4th/King. Never Coming here again!

This is one of my go to places to get breakfast in SOMA. They breakfast bagels are delicious, filling, and affordable!  While you can't go wrong with the sausage or bacon versions, if you're trying to stay healthy you should try the California version which comes with avocado, mushrooms, and jack cheese.</Text>

The woman taking my order was visibly annoyed when I changed my plain bagel option to an everything bagel while her tongs were still searching for the plain. I ordered an oj because on their website it says fresh squeezed but didn't get it. I'm assuming I was supposed to grab the generic bottle from the cooler behind me but didn't because I was waiting for that fresh squeezed. I paid for them both and just let the oj go because she was definitely over me. I ordered a bagel with lox and cream cheese as described on their site and menu board inside their shop which was made in seconds and when I got home it was a lox and cream cheese spread! Not actual lox, damn.<//Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Extremely disorganized, while waiting for my bagel I observed them mess up the order in front of me. When I finally received my bagel I checked the contents as I left the store and it was not even close to the bagel I ordered. I complained to the person behind the cash register and she immediately asks be how much I paid (which I don't remember). I'm also in a rush to go to work and don't have time to deal with this nonsense. I left the store hungry having paid the price of a bagel for the beginning of what I can tell is going to be a bad day.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Ahhh bagel bakery, or as we like to call it in the office...the bagel place. I love this place! Sandwiches are super tasty and filling. Once in a while I actually get a breakfast sausage bagel sandwich for lunch, yum yum. My favorite is probably #15... i forget what is in it, but if you're there just get it! Other good things to note are: the hotdog bagel thing is super yummy, get the spicy one. They also sell day old bagels in bags from 4-5 bagels for just $2. They don't have these on mondays just fyi. I do at some point, want to try one of their salads, so cheap and big! Customer for life.<//Review>< pics>

<text>I love that the workout is broken up, from the floor, the treadmill, and the rower. It’s never boring. The trainers are great and help keep you motivated. I love when they call out the time left on a workout. It pushes you to not give up or slack off. I’m a new member and everyone has been super helpful. Also, the music is the best!</text>< gmapID>

Orange Theory Fitness is for every type of athlete. The coaches and front desk staff at Carmel Valley make you feel like an all-star. From dynamic workouts to friendly motivational shout outs, this studio gives their 110%. They take the extra step to push you and remind you why you started - and how much you've improved. Coaches, you are incredible. Front Desk, you are amazing! HUGE shout out to: Ronnie, Damien, Troy, Claire, Savanna, Tori, Jeff, and Jamie! Thanks for the laughs and good vibes!< /review>

<Text>DO NOT GO HERE!

I cancelled my account with them months ago and then I am hit with a charge on my card two months later... I called in and the person I spoke with was zero help, said I needed a manager in order to change anything and wouldn't give me a phone number to call corporate or billing to report my issue. Another company lying to make a quick buck.<//Text>< date>

<Name>Jessica Sacker<//Name><text>The workout is very well constructed. I appreciate that every class is different as well as the fact that I am able to power walk if I cannot run. The staff and coaches are very supportive and friendly and they make it a point to ensure that newcomers feel particularly welcomed. As for the workout itself, I enjoy being able to monitor my heart rate and use it as a motivating factor. Overall, this is the most enjoyable and effective workout class that I have ever participated in. I extremely enjoy the experience every time.< /text>< Resp>

<Review>Took my first class and loved it so much I signed up.  It is a great workout that goes by fast because you're moving the whole time.  I hate the treadmill but it is palatable in the small rounds you do.  I was afraid it was going to be intimidating because I am out of shape, but everyone goes at their own pace and the instructor was very motivating and helpful.  My entire body was sore the next day, but in a good way!  I loved the summary from the heart rate monitor, it helps you know how hard you are working the whole time, and seeing how many calories you burned helps motivate you to keep doing it.  I highly recommend if you are looking for a group fitness workout!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

*Members and Buyers BEWARE* purchase membership at different location. My Experience at Carmel Valley Orange Theory was terrible! I have been a member at various OT’s for 3.5 years and have never experienced anything like this. Coaching staff is great but the front desk is a bunch of sales people. New members BEWARE!!! My boyfriend and I were convinced by the manager Rachel and assistant manager Amy to change our home studio to Carmel Valley from our original home studio. We gave them permission to make the change IF the rate stayed the same (as we had an original founders rate $50 less a month each than the going rate). Turns out they couldn’t keep our rate and went ahead with the changes anyway WITHOUT permission and then proceeded to charge it to our cards for months.
There was NO accountability every person I worked with deflected the problem on to someone else. Even the owner would not take responsibility.
After 3.5 years of being a member I thought they would treat me better or at least fair. Not only that I had refereed a total of 4 members to Orange Theory. Extremely dishonest business practice!
I recommend Orange Theory just NOT this one. If you must use Carmel Valley OT for convenience reasons do so but do not let them hold you membership. Sign up somewhere else!! You can still use their studio.</Text>

<Text>This review is purely about their reception staff,  I just got off the phone with a person there  to set up my trial appointment and as a part of their "welcome" to their fitness program, after I set my first appointment, they say this, ....you've to give us your credit card details, sign a liability form and also a deposit or something ...so " you don't run away with our heart rate monitor" I mean who says stuff like that , to their first time customers? i dont want your silly heart rate monitor, just because you may have the small mind to think that someone might "run with it" dont think its true.

Update: In contrast to the  first underwhelming phone conversation, I actually liked the workout when I went there for the trial class. I signed up for their 6 mo package. I didn't meet Isabella, though during my visit and being someone with a physical difference I felt like my needs were being well addressed and they've been, so far, quite helpful with providing alternatives to their workout routine.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Every bit of 5 stars for the people at OTFCV! I have never been able to get myself to workout anywhere near the level that I do at OTF. The people at the Carmel Valley location -- from the coaches to the front desk to the managers -- have never been anything but nice and encouraging, and the facilities are great as well.  Thanks for all that you do!</text>

I drove past Orange Theory Fitness about a thousand times before deciding to check it out. My mother was already a member and so I signed up for my first free class. From that class, I became instantly hooked! It has revolutionized my life in every aspect.

I am a law school student and finding time to workout, for me, was a challenge. OTF is a 1 hour, high intensity workout that produces results. I was looking for a workout that would get me cut and OTF has 100% delivered. Each workout is something new and wearing a heart rate monitor allows you to see your progress, on the screens, during your workout! Working out at OTF has changed my life in so many aspects. From the way I eat, the way I exercise, and the way I perform in the classroom/ court room!

The trainers are extremely motivating and personable. They really want to see you succeed and push you to your limit! The OTF Carmel Valley  staff has become like family! They are so friendly even at 5am!

If you are looking to challenge yourself and see fast results, OTF is your answer!<//review>

Great addition to Anderson Valley. Casual, tasty eatery and roadhouse for lunch and dinner. Nice beer selection, good wines. Small menu, but delicious food. Excellent pulled pork and fries. Perfect stop during a day of wine tasting, or on your way to or from the coast.< /Text>

This is a great roadside stop for food.  We dropped in for lunch and we got the cheese steak and chili.  Cheese steak bread was super soft and the meat was cooked perfectly.  Chili was solid too.  Service was small town like and friendly.  Recommended easily</review>

<text>Good food and nice staff. I ordered the tacos and lemonade. The pulled pork was delicious, the pickles tasty and the coleslaw was ok. To me the lemonade didn't have enough lemon flavor and not sweet enough. Almost watered down, still on a hot day it was refreshing. Will come come back and try the other food.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdTW1ITfix8twlFPsI_r8qt9CHxOBpLDleKj0S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOv2LTdGXZFsaLNTzFd1Htc2gOKZBtyjMPRxpIO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkCgZ5lw0_iZ1zUHHI4lIBbYfQAUbsbpcJFp3N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRreCCNtAE9ytk1ZYTB_WyBI6tbuA_SV6aIJZq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<review>We stopped here on the way home from Hindy, and we were not disappointed. Everything from the lemonade to the cuts of beef are made in house. The buffalo wings were hot and crunchy, which is exactly why they were perfect. The steak friter was so tender, it cut like butter. It was also smokey and served with the most flavorful Cole slaw I've ever had. The fries are hand cut, and totally amazing. I have no complaints about this place. The owner, who is also the chef, really enjoys his work and you can taste it in the food. Amazing food, amazing staff, amazing restaraunt, just a wonderful experience.< /review>< Response>

Poleeko Roadhouse is such a great addition to Philo!!

Our large group was there for dinner over the weekend and we had great meals. Several of us had the rib dinner, while others enjoyed the St Patrick’s Day corned beef and cabbage. We all agreed that a return visit is a must when we come back to Philo.  I can’t wait to try some of their other yummy-looking dishes!!< /text>

I'm a proud employee, and the food is amazing and excellent service. The owner has great instincts and is also a pig farmer so he sure knows his pork!

Had the wings, steak and a ramen noodle special and everything was absolutely out of the ballpark amazing. The staff was beyond nice, had a great conversation with the owner, booked reservations for tomorrow just because we HAD to come back ASAP. I almost don't want to write this review because I dont want it to get crowded for the next time I come back. Anyway, I couldn't recomend a place more highly than I recomend this one, easily and without a doubt my new favorite restaurant. Keep knockin em dead John and crew!</Text>< gmap_id>

WoW!  What a fabulous find in the middle of Philo.  The minute we tasted the pork products, we knew someone had taken exceptional care of that pig.  After a lovely discussion with the owner, we found out exactly how carefully he raises his pigs...Eastern European/Berkshire cross, with a very careful feeding program to ensure the best meat:fat ratio.  Everything else is well worth a trip up from the Bay Area.  Plan your next adventure and check out Lulo's 2014 Pinot while you're there!<//review>

Farmer John takes the business of feeding people seriously, and it shows.  Definitely a worthwhile stop for tourists and a welcome addition to our local environment.

Staff very friendly, they allowed me to bring in my other 3 digs to meet this dog. My Husband and I went in 2 more days to play with Duke before we brought him home. This dog is very friendly and loving, fit right in with our home.</text>

Unfortunately my daughter started getting allergies (we didnt know she had cat allergies! :c) so we had to take her back :,( she was so chill. Super curious and sniffed very loudly it was sooo adorable. She respons to whistles instead of the normal "kitty kitty" she must have lived with dogs or something x) anyways. I hope she finds a great home! She was good with my 2 children. She endured all the holding and stuff lol. At times I would forget we even had a cat (for that week) she was so chill and to her self at some moments. Wich I liked. At other times she did want cuddles. They think she is 4yrs old but I think she is younger like 1 yr maybe. But idk. She acts young. :)< /Text><Date>1550944906597< /Date>< Pictures>

<Review>We walked In here about 2 years ago "just looking" for a male dog. We spent about 30-45 minutes looking around seeing if we were drawn to any particular animal. I was ready to leave when my boyfriend saw the most adorably calm female pit bull. Took her out spent some time and that was it. 2 years later her 3rd birthday is almost here and I could picture our family without her. She was meant for us!</Review>< pictures>

The staff could not have been more helpful. Even with some timing glitches related to holiday work hours, they were most helpful and made it possible for us to bring our sweet little girl home for the holidays. These folks have an enormous responsibility for the animals, and to the adopting public.   I thought they did a spectacular job.< /review>< Rate>

I actually like getting animals from here and other country run shelters. I hope it saves an animal or makes space for a new one. They also have very cheap prices because it's county. I loved my kitty we got from here. It's clean and organized.< /Text>

My family and I had our first adoption from this shelter. I found this beautiful pit bull terrier who had this horrific cry. 🤣 (sounded like a new born baby crying lol) we knew that was the reason he was there for so long. So we adopted this little booger and he is the dog of my dreams!! He has not barked or cried at all since I had him and he acts like a lap dog! His snore is like an old man and I don’t even mind it! He has showed to be a little protective if he feels threatened but no bites only nibbles when he NEEDS attention lol and potty trained! I couldn’t have asked for a better pick! He fits like a glove in our family! Rexy is home! Thank you cvac!!! P.s. he is 3 years old about 45-50lbs definitely not a lap dog but he fits perfect in mine! 😍< /Review>

I got my two  (rescue) furbabies licensed due to foster failure. Its important in case they are lost or stolen. Fees are reasonable and they work so smoothly with rescues and other shelters. They are so sweet and understanding. Please adopt, don't shop. This is a really great animal campus to get your next family member. ❤🐶🐕❤🐾🐾🐾🐥🐰🐐🐈🐱❤💙💛< /review>

<Date>1523249735708</Date><rating>5< /rating><Review>They were awesome. The dog we adopted had been a stray out in the desert for a long time before she was picked up by animal control. She basically sat with her head under a table and shook when I went to go see her at the shelter. The staff was very encouraging and accommodating. They let me sit with her outside in a little run (because being inside was a confusing concept for her). The adoption process was very simple and the staff at both the shelter and vet clinic (where she was spayed before we brought her home) were extremely nice. The facility was well maintained and the staff seemed to know a lot about the animals there.  They also had a wide selection of different sizes and breeds and it is my understanding that they bring them from other shelters in more remote areas to make them more likely to be adopted.
After less than a week in her new home our dog was completely different. She went from hiding to greeting us at the door and seeking out affection. It has been 7 months and she is doing great. She is playful and extremely affectionate and we are very grateful to have her as part of the family.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Ever doing work release I highly don't suggest you work there Marissa  who does the intake is very unprofessional not to mention her supervisor diana Garnett.  This lady had the nerve to laugh at the fact that I'm highly allergic to cats and wanted to place me with then after being told that I couldn't work with them I was kicked off the property.</Review>

On December 7th at 10:30 at night I lost my precious 13 year old dog, a Chihuahua mix, Mona, who is blind, while walking my dogs in the desert in Cathedral City. I searched for over 14 hours.  It was the coldest night of the year.  There were fresh coyote tracks all over the desert.  My other dogs and I searched the whole desert and the the surrounding streets to no avail.

I was beside myself.  I love Mona so much.  After 14 hours I was devastated.  Mona can't even run.

Then, my prayers were answered.  Mona showed up on Petland's website after it was open only a few hours.

My deepest gratitude to the Animal Control Officer who found her!  Thank you!!!  She  had made it to the street.  It was a miracle the Animal Control Officer found her before she got hit.  She is blind.

I commend you for a job extremely well done!  You saved Mona's life, and for that I am eternally grateful!

The front desk lady and the gentleman who handled Mona while I was there were all very professional, yet compassionate.  I can't thank you all enough!<//text>

Clean, well run animal shelter.
Bravo for transporting unadopted animals, to no kill  animal rescues.
Gave this hard working  well run shelter a 4,  only because I hope one day,it will be a no kill rescue.
More than that,  people grow up, act responsibly.
Having an animal is not a right.
It is a privilege.
Animals are not throwaway toys.
Spay or neuter your animal please.</Text>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Hello .. i am sad to say that i am very very disappointed in this facility.

Because I am a proud animal owner.
I feel the need to say this .

I know what a 7 month old kitten looks like .

I have own various cats all my life.

I found a 7 month old kitten..
and she was clearly malnourished and had a wound and was in need of attention..
She had small baby teeth and it looked like her mouth was injured some how
I checked her paws and they were small and pink .. unlike my 13 yr old cat orion.

I called to get an update because I wanted to see if I could maybe adopt her or foster her as she recovers.
Somehow the kitten I took in, to get the much needed help somehow turned 15yrs old !
And is being put down because she too old to be adopted!

And this was told to me by one of the workers
She was very rude and I did not want to argue with her anymore.. so all in all I’m just disappointed because I thought I was doing the right thing and saving her life ..
turns out I was wrong but .
I know I’m right about one thing that kitten was spunky and had a fighting chance ..
next time I know what not to do..
Thank you for your time .<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I pray & hope they treat the animals better than the people that come in to try to adopt or anything for that matter..

Can’t express how this is THEE Worst customer service I’ve EVER experienced!
So-called “Officers” are THE worst&crooked shouldn’t even be called officers.
&the front staff EVEN MORE so! ***Especially the bigger male receptionist! ***
Worst customer service in the world!!!

I can Almost guarantee that any “good” commentaries on here were written by staff or there friends &or family members for sure!< /Review>< pics>

<review>If you should find yourself in a "What to do, were to go or how to" situation involving animals then Coachella Valley Animal Control is the place to reach out to. I went into the office and I was helped right on the spot. I was under the impression that they were there just to pick up unwanted dogs, and I'm more than pleased to say I was WRONG. They will guide you through each step in which issue you might have concerns in regards our furry friends  (animals).< /review>< gmap_id>

My dog was shaking to death and scared she does no harm and is a friendly dog she has never attacked anyone.

This place moves at the pace of a snail, no one ever tells you to grab a number and wait. The numbers are are hidden in the corner of the end of the counter. The service is mediocre, the staff could care less about their jobs. It's pretty clean, there's plenty of pets that need to be adopted, my mom got a really good deal on a dog she adopted there because she's a senior.< /Text>

I came in hoping to adopt a little dog and I really connected with a little pug. He was ready to adopt but they moved the review date five days later and told me that since many people wanted it they’d rather have a raffle. An animal is not a prize. I was very disappointed. This isn’t my first bad encounter here either, I adopted a dog three years ago at this shelter and she was sent in to get spade and when the operation was over they told me that my dog was pregnant and they just killed her puppies. They had no right to get rid of her puppies especially after legally she was mine. My dog returned home with severe anxiety and depression. Unfortunately she’s not with us anymore.</text>

If I could give it zero stars, I would. The dog catchers for this facility are rude, childish, confrontational and illegally trespass on private/ government property where only authorized personnel and official police are only allowed. I have no problem with someone doing their job but they have to follow laws and get permission. Not only did a dog catcher from here trespass on federal grounds but decided to puff himself up, get out of his truck and square up to me (a small female) for doing my job and telling him he wasn't allowed on the grounds without permission. He refused to leave and tried to catch a stray dog anyways. Less than a week later our organization received citations for the stray dog he couldn't catch  because he was upset (even though he obviously disregarded  the signs posted, what we said and kept chasing the dog). Then a few days later during our business hours while customers were in line he decided to waste our time and customers time by going in to tell us "He Won" after he finally caught the stray dog which had nothing to do with him tresspassing a gated and locked area.<//text>

My husband and I went to the shelter looking for a kitten.  Our wonderful cat Cinnamon Blue, a rescue cat we got 12 years ago, had died in February at the age of 17 years.  We felt it was time to share our home again.  There were many kittens and cats and we found a bonded pair (4 month old litter mates), so we adopted both of them.  They are currently being neutered and we will pick them up on Monday.  Can't wait.  This shelter was clean and neat and the animals for adoption all appeared very healthy.  The people working there were wonderful to us.</text>

Called on the phone to inquire about a dog they have listed as I had some questions to ask before driving 6 hours to their shelter. I was told anyone who can answer questions is "out walking around the shelter". I asked if I could leave my number to have someone return my call or if there was a time I could call back and was told they "can't give out that kind of information". Really? You can't tell me if a dog has been temperament tested, is good with people, or is food or toy aggressive? Sadly, I can't commit to driving 12+ hours round trip if they can't give basic information about an animal they are trying to find a home for.<//Text>

The cleanest place I've seen for a animal control. People are very nice there and work with each animal. They take all dogs out a few times a day which every dog needs so they don't lose that people interaction.</text>

<review>I am outraged at the conduct of employees at this agency. In order to release my service dog to me I was told he needed a rabies vaccine. My dog has a compromised immune system and can NEVER have any vaccinations. They gave it to him anyway! The agency has yet to deal with me and this malpractice.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>A worker named pricilla was so rude! If I had any questions or concerns I know not to ask for her and just ask for the manager instead!! Other workers that answer the phones don’t have the best attitude either, I’ve been calling for 2 weeks and non of my questions have been answered! I have to talk to a person for a citation and shr doesn’t even answer the phone and I’ve left multiple voicemails and nothing so far not even a call back,super bad service I will never recommend anyone going here, I’m only going because my dog got a ticket and I have to get everything done before the 17th , that’s in a few days and nobody has been able to help me with my questions! I’m just getting my dog everything she needs and I’m never going back there again! And I’ll never recommend this place!</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>It's always been clean ,staff pleasant . It's a hard job and I appreciate their efforts . I'm on my way soon to take a little doggy found loose on the street ,no tags . Please collar and tag your animals . This way if found , people can call and get them back home .
Final note, please spay and neuter your animals . No need to breed unless of course your a pro breeder.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

We adopted a couple dogs from them and Animal Control Officer Danny (the officer you see on the local news channel)  is always a wonderful help and knows all about his animals.  He truely cares about the animals and does a great job in helping them find homes.< /text>

Animals are wells kept. Walked around for an hour and a half and was never approached to see if help was needed or to offer any info.
I approached the employees that were in a room w computers to ask if I could meet a pup and her answer was "no, you have to adopt it to touch it" , she never even looked up from her computer< /Review>

They went out of theyre way to make sure we got our dog back who had been in accident with his owner. The animal control officer went back to accident scene 2 days after and found him called me and we picked him up a day before he was to be adopted out. They even took off the boarding fees god bless them</review>

I've been to the shelter a number of times to look for just the right pup to adopt.  Every time I visited I was treated courteously by the front desk staff, and when I was in the kennels every single employee I spoke to (and it was quite a few over time) went out of his or her way to get information for me or to have me meet potential adoptees, and to help introduce the two service animals we already have to the new dogs to see how they got along. When I went back to the Coachella Valley Campus to license our new addition with proof of follow-up rabies vaccination -- again, I was treated courteously and efficiently.

I truly hope anyone looking to adopt a dog or cat check out the shelter.  It took me a few visits to find the right pup but you might get lucky at the first visit... or the second.

Don't buy!  Adopt!!!  Every dog that's purchased means that somewhere another awesome dog is going to be euthanized (Coachella is a no-kill shelter, thank goodness).< /review>

I don't like going here because I already have 3 dogs and its difficult leaving without wanting to adopt another dog. But its generally a very clean place and wait time is no more than 5min.<//Text>

The front desk ladies and the “vet” or whatever she is are super rude! The animals there probably have more manners than them!!!!<//Review>

They keep kennel areas clean, and Dogs are exercised regularly. Not too many Cats when we were there. They are doing $20 Flat Fee Adoption Event during Date Festival.</text>

< review>
0 stars if i could. We adopted a dog from this place a few days ago. Firstly, they seemed to be rushing us. We had a visit with the dog and they came in and asked if we were done and wanted the dog gone before even asking if we had any questions about her. We really liked her so we went through with paperwork, the only thing they informed us about her was she was iffy about other animals, which was fine. We got her home and i started brushing her and black crumps started coming up on the brush, and a lot of it. At first i thought it was dirt, but i got suspicious of fleas eventually, and i pulled out her paperwork to reveal she was treated for fleas twice while she was there, they didnt care to tell us! She was filthy, full of dead fleas and flea dirt.. She was recently spayed so we were told not to bathe her for 10days due to stitches and recovery. So i tried to clean her as much as possible with just combing. Next morning i was combing her all out again and wanted to check her ears to make sure they were clean and at first glance I quickly noticed a odd brown thing. Closer look it was a big tick!  Must have been there for a few weeks. During their initial exams on her and pre surgery exams they should have noticed it on her and removed it. We got it out, but were very upset that these people were so neglectful. Day 3, was walking her in the morning, she had a poop and i see worms!!! The poor thing has worms as well. 3 days of having this dog and we're nursing her back to health. She is the sweestest thing and we regret nothing. But these people neglected this dog and neglected to inform us of her medical history, and didn't properly care for this dog. I 100% support adopting shelter dogs, giving a dog a second chance, but i also expect a place to care well for those dogs. It makes me think of all the other poor dogs there that could have underlying issues that arent being cared for properly. Very disappointed and wont be back there. I pray for the health of all those animals, and expect better things from that facility.< /review>

I did not take the offer by the owner/manager from the establishment back when I made the first review but since then they have improved greatly and while it is a commercial chain this location has stepped up their game. It's better than the local Papa John's and Domino's even.</Review><date>1615540209810< /date></record>

Don’t get a pizza here unless you want rude and ignorant people to never take your order and make you wait over an hour on a weekday. Also they constantly have negative reviews and do nothing about it. Should’ve read negative reviews so that my expectations for making just a simple order would be minimized.< /review></record>

< Review>
minutes ago
IF I CAN GIVE NO STARS I WOULD😡 Let me start by saying we never give reviews but, after what just happened.    A few months ago we had an order delivered we ordered stuffed crust pizzas,boneless wings some cheese tots. My kids started eating and I realized that we got NO STUFFED PIZZAS WINGS WITH BONE IN AND WRONG FLAVOR. I called the store let them know what was going on the guy apologized offered to remake my order and re deliver out correctly.I let him know my kids had had 2 slices that it was fine I just wanted to make him aware of the situation. AT THIS POINT HE OFFERED TO KEEP THE SAME CREDIT WE JUST SPEND  ON FILE FOR OUR NEXT ORDER. I called today requesting to use this and I’m told THAT I DONT EVEN COME UP ON THE SYSTEM AND THAT THEY CAN ONLY GIVE ME A $5 Credit for having me on the phone for over 27  minutes. ITS SO UPSETTING THAT THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.WE BEEN LOYAL CUSTOMERS FOR YEARS AND IVE NEVER HAD SUCH A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH PIZZA HUT. My parents worked for this company when I was growing up so so disappointed. FOR ALL YOU LOYAL CUSTOMERS MAKE SURE YOU GET REFUNDED  RIGHT AWAY IF YOU HAVE AN INCORRECT ORDER!!!</Review>

I enjoyed the pizza here very much. Im am not the biggest pizza Hut fan but the kids and wife love it. I just hate how greasy the pan pizza is and I wonder how natural there ingredients are? Cant beat some of there deals tho! And stuffed cheese crust never have a special for it but its worth it every now and then. All in all good food to your door</Text>

The person who took the order sounded like he would spit on your food if you asked why he sounded angry.  The guy who delivered the pizza was in a wife beater tank top.  You can do better.</text>

Waited on the line for about 10 minutes because everybody was craving pizza Hut.  Finally a punk answered the phone who couldn't get passed me giving him my address.  (he might have been high)  I gave him my order of 3 pizzas.  they were short, uncomplicated orders. He could not get his head wrapped around that I wanted a pizza with everything on it. After I held his through my order I gave him my card info, I like to pause every 4 numbers to make sure the person keeps up,  I repeated it 4 times.< /review>

<Review>I just called this place at 10:30pm to order pizza and the guy goes "I'm not taking delivery orders right now, I'm going on Lunch."  This place can burn to the ground.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My daughter who's in 1st grade earned a Free Pizza through the Book it program. I was told I owed 54 cents which I thought was odd. I was informed they now charge a service fee per transaction to off set there operation cost. I couldnt believe that now we have to pay them this ridiculous fee. Not so much the amount but nickle and diming us to death with ludicrous fees. I guess its no lonfer a free pizza will have to change the free pizza program transaction fee program. I took a picture and posted in in their photos from Google maps.<//Text>< gmapID>

I accidentally ordered diet Pepsi and I call and come to find out once delivered they have zero Pepsi after I paid for it. So I got over priced Sierra mist. Plus our pizzas are all squished to the side of the box. No bueno.</text>

<review>Petco typically does a great job of bathing and brushing my dog. It all depends on the groomer, of course, but most of the groomers who have worked on my dog have been amazing. I have a husky and she does quite a bit of shedding through the year. Most of the time Petco sends her home with very minimal shedding and looking bright and beautiful. The groomers are always super friendly and great with her. They see that she doesn’t like to be dropped off so they’re very sweet with her and they try to make her comfortable as I leave.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c33178e89aa45b:0xb07686eca2222f24</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<username>Renalyne Reyes<//username><review>My mini aussie was very scared and probably made it a little harder for her to do her job, but she seemed so patient and kind. She was able to get the 2 matted tangles behind sky's ears without using clippers...I was amazed. Her coat was perfectly soft and she smelled amazing. This was sky's first time ever at a groomers. So I will definitely go back to her.< /review>< Rate>

If this was my first time here it would be lower. The groomer hurt my dog by trimming his nail too short. I found him licking his paw and noticed blood pouring out from the nail. I'm sure he was in a lot of pain and it upset me that I was not told about this when I picked him up.<//Review>< pics>

They treated Ace really nice. His cut was great specially for this heat. They took good care of him. The groomer gave me advice on how to get my dogs hair from matting. Will be coming here for more future grooming.< /Text>

John and Maritza always provide excellent service for our 3 Newfydoodles.  I have no concerns about leaving them at this location with these two groomers. They are professional and kind.  We love them dearly!!< /Text>

There were several areas of long hair still on Chloe after I picked her up. I had to trim the areas myself when we got home. This is not the norm though.<//review>

Have always had wonderful experiences choosing trees and plants from Mark & Nellie's.  They have been patient and willing to provide detailed information about each plant or tree before purchase.   I have two beautiful trees in my yard as a result.<//text>

Believe it or not I was looking for a place like this.
I was all over looking for a nursery for plants.. and this place was fabulous

The woman that was there helped me enormously she was great.. she knew a lot about plants that grow in the high desert. we will be back again to buy more plants🏜< /text>

< Review>
My name's Brad. When looking for a mom and pops business to get your plants from or firewood, you can't ask for a better place. The prices, service and selection are all decent which is all you could hope for in a local business. Their Christmas trees were a way better quality than the lowes/home depot selection last year. I'll be helping these good folk out from here on out.< /Review>

We stopped by here to look at their Christmas trees and we're pleasantly surprised by the selection. My daughter fell in love was there small Charlie Brown style options and it was difficult to explain that are ornaments just wouldn't fit. We might just end up having to go back and buy it for anyways! LOL</Text>

<review>Interesting story about this location... That was originally built as a model home... My parents had them build their home in SVL by them in the early 80's ... I have a picture of my father standing on the steps of the model home as they were building their home...  Anyways glad Mark & Nellies Nursery are there now... We have had lots of stops at Mark & Nellies, I can only say the best about them!<//review>< pictures>

Very friendly and very knowledgeable.  Their pricing is comparable to the big box stores. They only bring in plants and trees that will survive in the high desert temps. They also warn you about dangers ie: poisonous to your pets, attracts bees,  etc etc. Honest family business.<//Review>

Great Prices, Unbelievable Service!   I called from Texas to have a tree planted at my Grandma's house in the high desert for her birthday.  The lady I spoke with took a good half hour to personally walk me through options and pick the perfect tree (a Texas Umbrella) to get delivered and planted, all over the phone, all within my budget, and guaranteed for the first year at the property.  My grandma tells me good things about their store-front and has had good experiences with them as well.  M&N: Thank you for providing me with VIP service.< /text>

< Review>
I definitely do NOT recommend Mark and Nellie’s landscape service from Victorville, CA unless your yard is already leveled and has proper draining that "they" do not need to worry about in landscaping.  I will be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau as well.  I should have gone to the BBB when Mark did not return phone calls after months of being ignored.  Now, the two palm trees planted and retaining wall they installed is great.

It was easy to get a hold of Mark LeBeuf and quick to come out for free estimate.  We discussed how the builders of my home planned the drainage for my backyard.  He said no problem.  I did get a few quotes, he was not the cheapest but chose him because they are from the high desert and have been in business for a long time.  Never again! Work was completed July 27, I believe.  Sprinklers, sod and palm trees looked good in beginning.  But after a week or two the water did not drain from the yard or soak into the ground.  I spoke to Mark a few times and told him I had to turn sprinkler timer down in the first month to a minute two times a day and I am hand watering the dry spots because water in backyard in the low areas did not drain nor soak into the ground.  The standing water grew algae and larvae.

After a dozen of phone calls to Mark, he possibly returned three or four calls.  I began leaving him messages in late October around Halloween.  By mid-November I began recording days I called and what time I called.  It seemed that I blocked my phone number using *67 he seemed to answer.  And when I left message that sprinkler needs adjusting, he returned that call immediately and had a worker come out and fix the sprinkler and drip line.  The worker, Andres (great man) agreed that Mark wasn’t conducting good business by ignoring my phone calls and issues with draining.  Andres agreed they should have leveled the higher part of the yard to be lower and install drains along the patio to catch the excessive water.  My backyard has a tiny slope from back fence to patio.  Mark later called saying that is a $50 charge.  So his work really isn’t guaranteed for a year, like he says.

After trying to get him to return phone calls to come back out to my house to see what the standing water has done to grass, I no longer tried to keep my dogs off the grass.  I thought, heck, if he doesn’t care about his business and reputation then I’ll let the dogs run and play on the ruined sod from the excessive water that I couldn’t get to drain to the two drains on each of the yard or to soak into the ground.  His work is supposed to be guaranteed for a year.

Finally, January 8th I got him to come back out to my house to see how bad the water floods.  I called my father to be here so mark wouldn’t talk down to a woman trying to convince me my dogs ruined the grass. Which is true, the dogs did wear away the sod but if Mark had been a “true” business man it wouldn’t be so bad.  He did agree to install two drains along the edge of my patio, but when they finished installing the drains they didn’t fill in the trenches completely and left a mini trench with a mound of dirt that I now need to level the yard again.  The yard now looks worse than before they were hired to do the work the first time.  Talk about a “half-ass” job.  Then Mark had the nerve to say he won’t charge me for the labor, just $125 for parts.  Mark needs to work on leveling yard so any excessive water flows off the grass.

I will NOT go back to him for more work unless it is part of the work he was to do properly the first time.  I wish I would have gone with one of the other companies that gave me free estimates.  If you do decide to go with Mark and Nellie’s Landscaping service I suggest setting up a payment plan so that way he will want to keep you happy to get the rest of your money.  Never again will I pay the whole cost when the work is “complete.”</Review>

So this is what I would call an updated review as far as getting my car tinted luckily the owner gave me a call to check on the status of my tint which I had an issue with once I gave him an update on the issue he had me come in and with my warranty replaced the film on the parts of the car that were blurry or not done well luckily that process was relatively painless and did not take too long so as far as I see so far that this is decent customer service that I can definitely appreciate with this kind of service I can recommend this place</review>

This place provides more than excellent customer service. This people will do anything to make you happy for example I came in left my car to tint my windows instead of waiting inside they gave me a loaner car for free. Who gives a loaner car nowadays nobody. The job they did on my car was excellent, they left interior spotless.</text>

I have been patronizing International Auto Radio since it was recommended, in the early 1980's by a friend from Walt Disney Studios, where I worked for 31 years. They must have installed 4 or 5 sound systems in various cars that I have had over the ensuing years up until this coming Wednesday, April 4th, 2018, when I will be driving to North Hollywood from Temecula to have the latest Kenwood GPS receiver installed(Excelon  DNX995S). Yes these guys and their expert installers are that good, Alex, Fabian, Marcelo, and Stefano and all in the same family! Alex was who I first met in the early 80's, and the other gentlemen were  little kids at that time! I can't believe how long it's been. I digress. Needless to say, these guys are the best! Great customer service, expert installation  and the work is done in a timely fashion. Like another reviewer said, "I am a customer for life!" Thanks again, see you Wednesday. Photo of install to come later.< /text>

I called in for a window tint the same day in the morning and was greeted very well. I came in at 9 am and Alex assisted me in the window tint. He showed me samples and answered my questions. I work down the street so he waited for me to get there a bit after closing since I had to walk to pick up my vehicle and pay. Great customer service and will recommend. I love the tint job..< /review>

This is a good place if you need an alarm or a stereo for your vehicle or just about anything electronic for your car, they just added a front and rear camera plus a navigation system to my Mercedez . They have been here forever so they sure know what they are doing, i have been using their service on all my vehicles for over 20 years. I Highly recommend them.< /review>

<Text>Poor customer service, Groupon scam, failure to fulfill advertised service.
I called the company on Saturday 11th of July in order to make a booking to tint the windows on my car. I called in regards to the Groupon deal they advertised to tint 7 windows in an SUV for $145. I asked for available dates during the week however they said they were booked up and book me in for the following Saturday at 10 am. After they say it should be fine and book me in I then proceed to purchase the Groupon. I went to the booking on Saturday 18th of July for my arranged booking and the manager came out to look at the car. I asked him to tint over the windows which he said might not be the best job but should be okay, he then said that I can add an extra two for $20 each so we then went inside to discuss the price and he started to write it up. I told him that I the Groupon and he tells me that he can't accept the Groupon on Saturday. I say that I had called last week to arrange a time regarding the Groupon and I this booking had been made for me on a Saturday. He said he would have never had said that and he doesn't know who I spoke, he told me to come back during the week however I wasn't pleased with this as I had already taken a day off work and driven down to him for our arranged booking. He told me that he will match the price of the Groupon but that I had to pay him then and there and that he couldn't accept the Groupon because they only get half of the value from the Groupon and they couldn't refund it. This was unacceptable as I had already spent $145 on their Groupon offer and am not going to then spend the same amount again. He started getting short and tempered which frustrated me. I told him that I am going to make a complaint so he told me to wait and that he was going to get the person I spoke to. I wait for around 5 minutes and then another employee comes to see me, he was polite however moved from reason to reason as to why they couldn't do my car today. First it was based on the Saturday booking which I told him that was arranged a week prior by one of their employees. He then tries to tell me that they can't do my type of car because the windows were too difficult (It's an old Land Rover which has flat almost square windows). He then moves to trying to say that the type of tint won't work. He was polite however tried again to just get money upfront instead of accepting the Groupon that they had advertised and booked me in on the basis of a week prior.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Let me begin with telling a little about myself. I am a car audio enthusiast. I have had 4 car audio show cars. My last show car won awards in every show it was entered into. I designed the system myself although it was collaborated with an engineer at G&S Designs (A very high-end speaker and amp company years ago) and an award-winning installer (Keith Davies). I was sponsored by G&S Designs, Clarion and Street Wires. My car was shown by one of the three sponsors for 3 years in a row at the CES show in Las Vegas. I myself because of my experience and being known in the car audio world in So.Cal was an official ISACA (International Sound Challenge Association)  judge.
So, that all being said, as I recently just moved back to the US and my car had been in storage for 15 years where most of the existing sound system had unfortunately deteriorated.  I had International replace the head unit, take out all the existing amps, crossovers etc. They did a good job with it. This was not an easy task as the car had spent the first 3 months of its life after the dealership in the stereo shop custom installing the show car system. With the installation of the new head unit and amp done, I moved to Vegas.
So, make a long story short, there is a problem with either the head unit or amp. Either hardware or installation. This problem is intermittent. When I went back to LA, I went to international to talk about the system. I was able to describe it well but as the issue is intermittent, I was not able to reproduce it when at the shop. International just talked to me like I am a person that has no idea what I am talking about when the reality is, I know more that most of them. To be clear, I’m not an installer and do not have the required installation knowledge and equipment BUT I do know sound systems and I can and do trouble shoot to narrow down issues. From there a good installer should be able to understand the issue and track down root cause. I understand they were busy and in their mind business on the floor is more important than standing behind what they do and fix it. New business makes money and standing behind what they do costs money but of course as most successful businesses know that’s shortsighted and customer service and taking care of the customer through full lifecycle is of equal if not more important in the long run success. International has been around a long time. They are obviously doing something right BUT could it improve? Could they be much more successful? I avoided to many warnings that this could happen by guys I still know in the business but went with my gut and price so in that way this is my own fault using International instead of others that were recommended so I’m kicking myself in the butt now.< /review>

Sold Alex a good vintage radio which he said didn't function correctly. I told him to return it for full refund which he agreed to do. Believing I was dealing with a reputable firm I refunded his full purchase price and shipping - Alex never returned the radio or phone calls or emails. Stay away from this company.<//Text>

First review by Kecin is probably someone who works there. This is place is a RIP OFF. Over priced, rushed job. Left a mess in my car. Employees are rude. I spent 5 thousand dollars on a system and Alex the owner treated me like dirt. He has no personal skills. The job took way longer than promised and was not even done correctly. I have to go back several times to have them fix issues. What a waste of my time. GO somewhere else and save yourself a headache.<//review>

Then you have the audacity after you low ball me for my amp and woofer to offer an installation?\n\nNo way.\n\nI left you a nice 1 star review online. I bet that will cost you more in lost business then had you properly valued me as a patron and loyal customer.\n\nI have recommend friends over the years.

Alex,Alex, Alex.

I just got a letter from my credit card company where you and Fabian said I never took the car back to you guys to fix the short you induced and that you were surprised I never called you guys to inform you about the problem with my car.

I gave you $1200 to install my own alarm,speakers and stereo on my 65 Impala.
Yes you attempted to fix it three different times after I disputed the charges with my credit card company.

I know you said to bring the car back if there was still a problem, I'm tired of you and your shop, keep the $1200, I'm sure this review is going to cost you more than that.

I'm very disappointed and angry at you guys, as far as I'm concerned you guys are thieves.<//review>

These guys took great care of my faulty alarm system in record time and at a fair price.

Coming back for some tinting!

One of my favorite bars to go to for live music. Have yet to see a band play here that I did not like.< /Text>

<Review>Came here on a Tuesday night for Karaoke and it was loads of fun. The DJ was great and fair with his song rotation. There were plenty of people, all of which provided for a fantastic karaoke atmostphere. Didn't see a food menu, but i asked the bartender for a rye and ginger and I'm pretty sure I got a rye and gin. Great karaoke bar!</Review>< user>

<review>A security guard aggressively came into the bathroom while I was still using it, then had his croney carry me out via choke hold when I yelled at him. Don't go here unless you're into invasion of privacy and power tripping security.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

The Alley accommodated us for my friend's bachelorette party on a Saturday night. They let us come in when they opened (6pm) and decorate for the party to reserve our location by the dance floor and live band. They also let us keep our cupcakes in the fridge. We arrived at 9pm where everyone from the bouncer to the bartenders made us feel very special since it was the bride-to-be's special night! At the end of the night the bride was hungry and they (the waitress and bouncer) offered to walk next door to pick up a pizza we ordered, HOW kind and seriously above and beyond it was. They went out of their way to make us all feel special and welcomed. The music was awesome, and we liked how they had the live band but then also played dancing music in between too. I would recommend going here to anyone! Thank you for the great service!<//text>

<Review>I have never experienced such terrible service in my life. The bartender literally put her hand in my face and told me to go away after waiting 25 minutes for a drink. Absolutely insane.<//Review>< Name>

I was assaulted by the security for no reason and removed forcefully.  They are very unprofessional. The oceanside police department was very unprofessional as well although they did say security was out of line as well. If you want men who made poor life choices man handling you. This is the place for you.</text>

<review>Drinks are cheap and the floor is sticky. Music is too loud, the band was horrible, and the sound bounces off the walls. The cigarette smoke wafts in from outside. This is all expected for a dive bar.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80dc721aaae9c3ab:0xb4a88743c893fad6< /Gmap_id></record>

Can ride the entire area in less than 1.5hrs, there is 1 advanced part.

Very nice place to ride but people where not as willing or able to give recommendations or knowledge about the trails, primarily the ones to get In and out of the ohv staging area. Will definitely visit again it was a great first time experience.<//review>

Small, but great for beginner and intermediate dirt bike riders.  Just look out for slow Jeeps some of the trails.

Don't trust Google maps if it tries to bring you in the back way on a Jeep trail.  It might be faster, but will need a 4 wheel drive if you go this way. Make sure you enter from the Ortega Highway side if you have a car, camper, or a trailer. It is a paved road all the way to the staging area.</Text>

<Text>We went here last minute. We are new to the off road scene and found 1 trail that was easy, the rest seem out of our expertise. Be careful which trail you decide to go up and down if you're a newbie like me. You could get stuck. Very nice area . Will definitely be back soon. Also the camp ground was closed. Not sure when it will be open. But nice hideaway spot!<//Text>< pics>

Wide variety of trails, large staging area.
Kids place to practice and learn, not too hot this time of year. Picnic area closed for some reason.<//Review>

<Text>If you follow Google to get in to the Wildomar OHV, do not follow Google via La Cresta.  It is a difficult dirt trail and not a road.  Once at Wildomar OHV, the trails are techical for a razor but enjoyable.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKqrYv2a2aE-mUEt4HFBJr_XxvPnlOQrGQP-4y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I first heard the wildomar ohv area was open after the fire, I went on 2/23/20. The road to the spot was scenic and wasn't too rough. When I got there I noticed a sign "STOP PAY HERE," there was no personel and no kiosk to pay. I parked, started putting on my gear and saw park ranger truck approaching. The ranger gave the rider next to me a citation for not paying the $5.00 cash fee. The ranger proceeded to ask about the bike and whether it was registered or not. I had a registered and legal bike but didn't have $5.00 cash, but I was fortunate enough to meet a couple that gave me the $5.00 cash to put in an envelope, provided by the "pay here" post. After paying the fee and having evidence of doing so I felt comfortable enough to unload my bike and ride.  Overall, it's small, tight, and dangerous. Having quads, dirt bikes, and some mountain bikes all in the same area is a recipe for disaster. If you do choose to ride Wildomar OHV just remember DON'T RIDE "BLOODY JERSEY HILL!" Also, don't forget to pay the $5.00 CASH fee for each bike.< /Review>

<Review>It’s really not offroading it’s more of a series of small trails that go up and down super easy trail (I recommend Cleghorn)</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>This place is awesome. I've always suspected that my '96 Toyota Corolla was meant to be a Rallye car and tonight we proved it. I may plan on adding a 4" lift in the future, but even with 165/70r14 tires we managed to tear this place up. You should have seen us coming down those gravel roads. The handling was predictable especially coming around corners going 50-65 mph. We only bottomed out once and that was after hitting the tabletop going about 55mph.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>There are some awesome off road trails here, some definitely would be easily over taken with a standard vehicle with plenty of ground clearance but I've Covered most of the mountain in a rental Kia Soul in the past.  Always finding new things that I'm unable to find any information on,  where I stand now it's malted Wildomar OHV and has an enclosed chain link fence with a sign stating the adventure pass isn't valid here yet it looks like a tunnel entrance that's been blocked off.

< Review>
I totally thought i was lost on the way there.  So if you feel the same you are heading in the right direction.  I will probably park on the top and ride in next time.  Road is narrow.  Camp site is clean and well kept too. Very well kept area.  Will return.<//Review>

I really Love the fries and the Whoppers but today on May 16, 2021 I send my parents to get whoppers for me and I order 2 whoppers and fries and a small orange Fanta soda but I didn't get a straw which it shook me because I will usually get a straw and I only got 1 ketchup which is sad because how am I going to put one tiny drop of ketchup on two Whoppers???  Burger King please do your job correctly. And put more ketchupsssssss!!!!!!!!!< /Review>

I went in through the drive thru on Saturday and their system was acting up which ended up having me wait 30 minutes while they tried to fix it. In return for waiting they gave me nuggets. I find out on monday that they charged my card 3 times which came out to $90. I go in to talk to management and they say that they will fix it. Its been a month and no call which was promised or nothing at all. I would not trust this location unless you pay with cash.< /Text>

Ordered food and a Coke, and and when I got home the coke turned into a sprite. How can you run a business when you constantly make mistakes? Tried to call to complain and the phone number doesn't work. Go figure.</review>

If she had said "next time can you let us know that your going to use a coupon" what she told me " you were supposed to tell us you were using a coupon"
2. I ordered a cheeseburger kids meal she gave me chicken nuggets
3. I ordered 2 orders of chicken nuggets and asked for ranch and BBQ sauce, she repeated what I said but still only gave me ranch<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I like this location as they have yet to mess up an order. I also like ordering online from their app which has some pretty good deals!</Text>

Very poor service. The employee there was very rude. I asked for the two for 6 whopper deal and she asked for a promo coupon code. I tried to explain that it didn’t have one since it’s listed on all advertisements. She said I couldn’t purchase it without it when my sister had just came home with it a few hours ago and she was not asked for the code. I had to say hello a few times to get acknowledged by her. I stated my entire order and she just stood quiet. I had to ask if she got that? And she responded with an attitude saying, No I didn’t. It was horrible! Never again will I ever go there and I will tell everyone I know not to even think of going there.</Text>

I am completely disappointed and dissatisfied with the quality of my food. Chicken nuggets were dry and burnt, tasted like they were done the day before since I went to purchase at 10am. The French toast the same, my crossainwich was too salty. I would recommend you visit a total different location. I know I will.< /Review>

Edit: About 20 minutes later I got my whopper. Worth it. The burger was full of flavor and now I'm craving it again today LOL</text>< date>

This place does not deserve a star. They serve old food. I went in at 9 am for breakfast on the go with my 5 year old he ordered chicken nuggets and ohh boii he immediately wanted to cry and vomit. They were so hard dry and stale its hard to believe they were cooked that same day Overall i spent like $30 didnt get a reciept or else i would of called and ask to speak to someone and i would of taken the food that all went to waste.</text>

<Date>1582263035825<//Date><Rate>1< /Rate><text>Store manager, I hope you check these reviews every so often.

At 845pm, Feb 20, 2020 we had a very unpleasant interaction with a member of your staff. We ordered a milk shake via the app and were informed the order could not be fulfilled when we arrived.

This however was not the issue. The individual at the counter was rude and abrasive. He informed us the store had no ice cream machine and we would need to select either a Frape or a coffee. Neither approach the value of the item we purchased. When we asked to repeat the options because we did not catch what he said the first time he went into a fit and ignored us for a solid two minutes. Highly unprofessional. We asked him for his name, and he reacted in an abrasive way stating he was too busy working. Last I checked we were paying customers.

I hope this reaches the store manager and that individual uses the time and date I've provided to provide feedback to this unprofessional clerk. We have also followed up with a case lodged via Burger King customer support case ID is YWSSB.< /text>< Pics>

Finally purchased the IMPOSSIBLE WHOPPER. Let me tell you that it is DELICIOUS!!! I had to check to see if they accidently used beef. O-M-G!! The flavor is there. The charbroiled taste is there. The generous siZed burger is there. I am well pleased. From now on that is what I will be purchasing when I want a burger 🍔 Two thumbs up.</review>

If I could give BK no star's I would...the quality of their chicken sandwich was gross... like mush in a fried breadcrumb.
everything we got was really bad I would just stick to the Whopper and even that is questionable at times.</text>

<review>Food was good, but my order was wrong. When I tried to only order 4 meals I ended up going home with 5!! Either there was some miscommunication or the drive thru attendant was not paying attention. I was upset that I paid more than what I expected but honestly I was too tired to even turn back and correct it.<//review>< pics>

<review>My family and I stopped for a quick bite at this restaurant around 7:30pm. The order was taken fairly quickly by a tall grumpy looking guy. The floors feels tacky and dirty when walking. There was a broom and a trash pickup leaning on one of the tables and a yellow sign on the floor. We were there for about 40min and no one picked up any of the items from the tables. You have to put a quarter in if you want to use the bathrooms and the lady's bathrooms was filthy dirty. I asked for a token to use the bathroom which the manager replied "if your a customer yes I can give one for free". I showed him the drinks that I still had in my hands, then  he gave me a token with a face like non pleasing face. All the employees at this restaurant look like if they don't want to be here. No one smiles for the customers and I will not cameback here. Sorry.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2d0adcae4fe1b:0xc0afdb1a70be4e2f<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>
<text>It's common for BK's to have low reviews. This is the highest reviewed BK I've come to. It turned out to be the worst BK I've been to. Came in the morning and there was a worker shortage. No one inside was getting food since they prioritized the drive through. 30 min and about 20 drive through cars later, we finally got our food. Fries were cold (sitting for a while). Food was meh. To top it off, (what it seemed like) a rude Homeless lady walks in and demands money from everyone at the tables. When she came to us we automatically told her no (since she was rude). She touched and grab some of our food and ate it. I will be avoiding this BK from now on.</text><Date>1541267470726</Date>< userid>

Visit most Tuesdays and Thursdays with friends after flying RC planes.  Good, friendly staff with standard Burger King foods.  Norma is a real gem.< /Text>

They closed both restrooms when they have customer in the restaurant waiting for them to open it. More then 30 minutes. Very poor customer service.</Text>

Terrible service, the workers can't take an order. They always end up giving me the wrong food. A while ago I got chicken nuggets  and that were spoiled. Today I want again and ordered chicken nuggets again and instead they gave me some bread sticks and i didnt even notice until i want home. I do not recommend to come here.<//review>

Too much mustard on burgers. Probably on purpose because I complained about not getting the correct hamburger. This burger king is shitty. Never going again. ZERO STAR<//text>< Pictures>

All four drinks were severely watered down.
Maybe they forgot to replace the bag or something but either way bad soda. (Coke and Orange Fanta)
Tried calling to let them know, and without ringing even once got a message saying the magic jack customer is not available, so I’m assuming their phones were out/don’t have any? Or they just didn’t want to answer.</text>

(Translated by Google) The attention they gave me was very good, I was wearing the Tmovil special and one of the employees kindly helped us with the application. He recommended the vegan amburgesa, and the truth is very good.

(Translated by Google) The food was good! Thank you, but when I asked if I spoke Spanish to the young lady who would receive me, she showed an unpleasant gesture and told another person to take my order.

(Original)
La comida fue buena!! Gracias,  pero al preguntar si hablaba español a la señorita que me recibiría,  mostró un gesto poco agradable y hablo a otra persona para que tomara mi orden.</Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The truth is that I like it a lot but for a while here the ladies who attend are not kind at all, they give you the wrong order and then the offenders are made when we tell them as if they gave us the food, to top it all they forget the order and when they give it to us all cold, hopefully they improve the service, there was an African-American before it was very kind the boy I liked to go because he treated you very well but now nothing to see., I'm sorry but it's the truth.

(Original)
La verdad ami me gusta mucho pero de un tiempo para aca las señoritas que atienden no son nada amable te dan la orden mal y luego se hacen las ofendidas cuando les decimos como si nos regalaran la comida, para colmo se les olvidan la orden y cuando nos la dan toda fria,,ojala mejoren el servicio,habia un afroamericano antes era muy amable el muchacho me gustaba ir porque te atendia muy bien pero ahora nada que ver.,lo siento pero es la verdad .<//Review>
