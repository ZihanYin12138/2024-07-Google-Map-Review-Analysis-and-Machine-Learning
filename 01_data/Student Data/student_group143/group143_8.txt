< review>
I lost the keys for my car so there was no way to get in or put it in neutral. On top of it it was parked in a super small drive way. Ali came with his tow truck and spent almost one hour to get the car out of there safely. He was super nice and friendly and made sure that the car was not damaged at all. Such great service I highly recommend Ali if you have a tricky situation like this! Thank you so much!< /review>

Yoel from Ole & Sons was what we needed in our stressful situation at 3am. My 09 Mustang's belt came off of its pullys deeming it undeliverable. Yoel was very kind and a great person to talk to during a time like this. I recommend their towing service, I will be using them again in the future! Thank you guys!<//text>

Yoel was a superb driver. Courteous and helpful and he placed my car in a hard to access place in my driveway with such precision that it blew me away. Had he not been willing and able to achieve this feat i probably would have lost my car to the city. This dudes an ace and if you get lucky and he helps you out you're getting the very best.<//Text>

I have to hand it to Ali, he did great! We needed to move a classic car that doesn't run and he took the time to do the job right and went above and beyond to make sure the car was safe. He even figured out how to get the car into a difficult spot...maneuvering his truck and the car so it would fit in a corner of our yard. Ali was really good natured about everything, super professional. He should get a medal.</Review>

<review>I’m extremely grateful for Ole & Sons and the way they conduct business. They were so professional and empathetic toward me and my situation. I ran out of gas on the side of the freeway and they were there in less then an hour, their customer service was incredible! Yoel communicated with me every step of the way... I will 100% recommend them to all of my friends and family. You don’t find great customer service that goes above and beyond like this often so I am just extremely grateful and appreciative of the service and experience they gave me.<//review><Date>1619603017468<//Date>< pics>

The price they charge for 6 miles I will never use again. They charged $250.00 for 6 miles with broken wheel on flat bed. They will quote cheap price and then charge high plus if you cancel it's $25.00. I will call State Office of Consumer Affairs and BBB.</review>

What a personable guy, I not only felt SUPER safe with him showing up to help me before 5:00am, but he has to be one of the kindest people I’ve ever met!
IMPECCABLE customer service...above & beyond...a beautiful soul !!!
Wish more people had his over the top genuinely wonderful persona!!!

I used their service in the end of January and since then i wanted to write a review. My battery died suddenly and my insurance company used the services of Ole & Sons. The person who came to help me was Joel. It was 1am when all that happen. He was very professional, friendly and caring. He tried jump starting my battery but it didn't worked so he took my car to the shop where i requested. Where afterwards on the next day i needed a new alternator actually. Everything went smooth and i'm very greatful for the help that i receive. Thank you very much!!! Great service!!!<//review>

Great people. Great service. Found myself in need at 3:30a. Stuck on the side of the freeway. I opted out of a roadside assistance program that I subscribe to monthly to use Ole & Sons. As soon as I made the call my problems were solved. I was informed by a call from Joe that he was on his way. And, updated by phone when he Encountered a delay. The whole process took about thirty minutes - after I wasted thirty minutes just navigating through the automated prompts of the service that I subscribe to monthly. It is always better to speak to a human, that can solve your problem.< /review>

Yoel at Ole & Sons was an amazing down to earth tow truck driver. My wife and I needed a flat bed for our car that had a fiberglass body kit. He arrived in the time frame that was given, and even called us to update his ETA twice. We really appreciated that. On top of that he was a true gentleman and waited for us until our Uber ride came. They also have ramps instead of wood planks for extra ground clearance for loading. Great hard working employee and great person.< /Review>

We were told 45 minutes. This guy was here quicker then that! He looked over the damage and assured me the car is good (mechanic said it was fine too besides the tire and rim) he was so quick! The drive home was fast! Customer service was PHENOMENAL!!!!! I would more then recommend these guys!< /review>

<text>It was late a night when I went to get in my car and panicked when I found out I had a flat tire. After making a few calls and finding a lot of companies were closed for the night Ole  & Sons saved the day for me or should I say night! First off Brian who I spoke too on the phone was super nice and inviting. He got straight to the point, gave me my quote and instructions in order to get my tire fixed. Yoel came to fix my tire. He was very nice, efficient and I was comfortable speaking with him while he quickly fixed my tire. Within a hour of calling them I was back on the road ! I highly suggest using this company if you ever have any problems in Los Angeles !!!<//text>< username>

I had an accident on freeway , i called this company.
They came on time . Yoel is the person who helped me , he was professional, caring, friendly and willing to take extra effort to help me. My parking lot is a place where the tow truck can not enter, he pushed my car and did really extra to park the car.
I am really happy with  the service .
Thank you so much Yoel<//review>

In addition, he was able to tow my vehicle, which had an aftermarket bumper (lowered). Yoel was friendly, had excellent communication, and a truly genuine person to wait with us until a Uber arrived. I can't thank Yoel enough for all his hard work!

All my things got stolen and my car battery died due to the thief leaving the doors open. I was confused and felt vulnerable dur to the events. Yoel was sent out to help me with my problem. He was very professional, on time and just a real person. He heard me out, he cared and went out of his way to make sure I was OK. He jump started my car and didn't leave the location until he was sure my car wouldn't died. I never experienced customer service like this before. On a night that was so horrible for me, this company and Yoel made it a lot better. I'm very thankful for all your help Yoel, God bless you, I hope you never change. 🙏<//review>< Resp>

Very grateful for this towing company!  My daughter's car, broke down on RT 23 South, on 2/01/21 and the dispatch and driver Yoel Leal, was very professional and kept tabs on my daughter to make sure she was alright!  Yoel, the tow driver took great care of my daughter's car by placing it safely on the flatbed.  I would highly recommend this company for your towing needs and if you get Yoel, it's even better!  Thanks guys for your service!👍🙏

Worst customer service I have ever received, wish I could give zero stars. Front office caller is a young immature teenage child who cursed throughout our call and made our entire family genuinely feel under threat throughout entire experience.

Edit; I’m a real customer and would simply like to point out how badly mistreated I was at this shop. Don’t do business with these people until they learn some ethics!</Review>

<text>My truck Broke down on me just before i made it home after 5 hours drive from SF
I got stuck on the 5 freeway with barely signal to call my triple A or any other towing company from the area and while I’m still on hold with triple A after almost an hour just to find out where am I Luckily one of their drivers pass by and kindly asked if he can assist in anything , well I had a small doubt about the price because I needed to go another 30 miles but I when I asked him he gave me a great deal after confirming with his boss it didn’t took long before we were back on the road and he even gave me a bottle of water from his collar !!
Thank you guys I’ll definitely recommend them for any type of help you need<//text>< pictures>

I've had a storage unit at my neighborhood Derrel's for over 10 yrs. In that time I have never been broken in to. Never been on fire. Never flooded. Not even an act of God. You can be at ease knowing your stuff is safe and looked after very well. If I had to complain about something...it would be that my light burnt out over three years ago. Lol I guess I should tell them if I want it replaced. You can't go wrong with Derrel's. As long as you pay your bill... your stuff is good. And from what I hear...they will work with you to take care of it.<//review>

Darrell's always provides a service that can be counted on. They are on point with their housing facilities and they have shown humanity in their willingness to work with customers with unfortunate circumstance. They have always kept and guarded my belongings well and I take comfort in knowing that my stuff is safe in their hands....as long as the bill is paid lol!<//review>

The library has reopened, but the cafe is closed and there is no seating anymore. You can just go inside and select books yourself. I’m still pretty happy :)< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Friendly staff and an awesome library! Liked the collection, also the layout. It was quite peaceful to read there, it's relatively small but small is better if you can find what you need in time. Typically it used to take much longer for me to find interesting books than what I had observed here, so maybe it's a good collection or my interests have changed lately.

Library is quite bright, I liked the view of the apricot garden from study desks. There's very few wall outlets so if you're planning to work on laptop, better to either bring it fully charged, come at less popular hours, or close the lid when the battery is dead and spend time reading real books there which isn't bad, maybe a bliss. One of the patron has installed more ports around the sofas which is quite useful in the emergency.

Children's section has nice collection too. One cool thing I noticed was that books for parenting are also found in the children's section. It's great idea as it makes books more accessible to relevant people. I'd have actually missed getting few very useful books had I not found them there. Thanks to whoever thought of this!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Review>This library is great. The no-appointment line is at the main library and a bit long so I recommend making an appointment. You can pick those up near the soccer field and theater house.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Easy to return books both during and after hours. Great selection of new releases and bestsellers; All genres are broken down into sections in the library, including sci-fi/fantasy. Great activities for kids, teens and adults both at and away from the library. Definitely use your library card to check out museum passes!</Review>< pics>

I really like this library and have been going there for years. It is an older library, sort of out of the 70s, but it fits in with the little town of Los Altos feel. Many young and many old come here. People study hard here and they have a good online book reserve system online (it's a Santa Clara County library). I've always found it to be a pleasant and welcoming place. Sometimes, there are older men reading papers in different languages who will fall asleep in chairs while reading. I always like that and it demonstrates the comfort and community feel of the place.< /Review>

< review>
This review is written from the perspective of a mama of a toddler, so I have only used the children's section. There is a good play area and fun surrounds (daughter loves seeing the fishes), and they have lots of events for kids. I'm docking two stars off for the presence of iPads at toddler-level (with a sign that says they are only for use for kids over 2 and with adult supervision). Even now that my daughter is 2, I don't see the point in going to the library for her to play on a screen, while surrounded by books and other kids to play with! This is a personal view but if you have similar screen-free preferences for little ones, I thought it might help. We've stopped going because the pull of the screen is too much for her/me to handle.</review>

Whenever I'm looking for books in the county's online catalog, Los Altos almost always has it, making one-stop borrowing eady. Super fast and easy checkout. Decent parking lot but seems like it's often quite full.<//Review>< userid>

The quietest library in the south bay. The interior is dated, but it's a great place to read in private.</review>

Not too big, not too small, just right.  Also has many DVDs as well which is a plus.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808fb0eec3743d23:0xfc99aea86bf62dc6</Gmap_id></record>

The facilities are fine, but you have to pay an annual fee just to get a library card if you are not a Los Altos resident! A public library that you have to pay to be a member of. Of course, you can just read the books you want inside the library, but still... there must be other ways of filling in this budget gap, if this is indeed a result of budget issues...</review>

<user>101858229359839309716<//user><Name>C DuCray</Name><Review>Unless Los Altos resident, computer use costs $4 for two hours same-day (expires end of day), and you can't check out materials; or you can buy $80-a-year library membership. I've never heard more loud people in a library: adults, staff, children. What happened to quiet in a library to let people read and study in peace? Yikes. Wifi is free, fairly speedy and reliable.<//Review>< rate>

<text>Having not been in a public library in ~15yrs, I walked in here with a simple question about the books I had and needed.  Since all my memories of public libraries prior to this are fond and full of smiling and overly helpful librarians, it was a shock to be met with scowls, annoyance, and overall rudeness.  There was also some passive aggressive commentary made by some random library patron who did not have anything to do with the situation but felt the need to interject without actually engaging.  My questions and myself were clearly unwelcome in this place.  0/10, would not recommend.<//text>< Gmap_id>

An assortment of beverages and even some snacks. They have darts and plenty of open seating, inside or out. Convenient location with lots of free and safe parking.

Been coming here for years when in the area. Locals dominate the crowd in the daylight hours but a younger crowd takes over in the evening, all friendly and social. Never any drama here and it wouldn't be tolerated.< /review>

<Review>Vibes! We stopped by around 6pm on a Friday, no line! This place has got a cool speakeasy vibe. Service, food and drinks were great! We tried almost everything on the menu. My favorites included the toasted egg yolk in brioche with salmon roe and the cheeseburger bao was money! Try the banana splits! We did the chocolate, cinnamon ice cream split with black sticky rice. It was sooooo good! Can't go wrong with the drinks! All great!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>Great local bar ( if you haven't noticed  , neighborhood bars like these are disappearing  the real estate is just too valuable around here and people who own the land or these bars are getting rid of them) good bartenders, value is still there, good size shots nice pour on the mixed drinks. Talk to Jessie, he can find you anything.......seriously this guy is a great hunter!!..<//Text><gmapID>0x808fa384f94515ed:0x799158ffb8762d19< /gmapID>< Rating>

Great local bar with super friendly locals.  They had both the Warriors playing and NFL football.  Draft beer was reasonably priced.< /Text>

A legit dive bar. A cowboy bar. Authentic Redwood City croud. Good drinks. Not terribly expensive. Just a bar where you'd want to wind your day down.</Text>

Truly a neighborhood bar. Afternoons occasionally have a chance to see legends like Jim Pluckett or Jerry Rice. Drinks generally 4-7$ most times of day. Everyone's a regular or knows a regular. Be one of us!<//review>

<text>The 1 star is for our drive thru worker who was basically doing everything alone (she gets 5 stars) The 3 other women behind the counter were huddled together talking and one of them had her MASK BELOW HER CHIN AND EATING with her fingers, no utensil, less than 3 feet from the food bays!!! We will not be returning to this Jack in the Box. Before COVID I wouldn't have expected to see an employee eating behind the counter but it is obvious that this Jack in the Box does not take safety procedures seriously. Disgusting no matter the year or time!< /text>< name>

<Text>It’s great that you accept ebt or food stamps but requiring that I go inside to order is demeaning and unsafe. The government understands that I need and deserve to eat and you do too to an extent, why isn’t my form of payment good enough for you that I can use the drive through? And why if the Padres hit a home run and everyone else that pays to buy a large drink gets a jumbo jack but my ebt card isn’t good enough for you. What’s the real problem???<//Text>< pics>

It's a very cool place to see where and what item will be placed on the Jax menu in the future! It's a great place to go on a fieldtrip with your school! Teaching the kids about healthy eating and nutrition, and healthy options instead of just junk food only! A really fun place to go and to learn! Check it out!!<//review>

Too bad. Jacob mgr at jib at Fowler & Heardon in Clovis Ca. 2nd time wants to lecture me that I should be more patient - that they have 4 minutes to respond, and "i'm a Marine". Don't believe he's x-marine - too rude. Any jib mgr should not be lecturing customers. Please get rid of him.  He will bring this location down. Before him everyone was wonderful. Told me to wait around corner for food and then it never came. JACOB MUST GO. Thanks so much.< /text>

Went to JIB # 6836 at 12:34:51 pm starting my order off with a L iced coffee, "we dont have any iced coffee." Was the response so I ordered a 21 just the sandwich and a Tea then proceed to get a #3 they with a dr pepper. She didnt ask if I wanted curly or straight .. get to the window she then gave me what appeared to be water . She fixed it and got me the tea I pulled around to parking lot to eat .. to realize I have unsweet tea and diet coke no one would come to the door I had already waited 15 minutes  in the drive thru and the phone number isn't in service for this place I am totally disappointed and will never be back to this location< /Review>

So I tried to order food on 3/6/21 at night and the lady was so rude saying that they couldn’t make any food unless it was through the mobile app and then once I tired through the mobile app they ignored me on the drive through speaker after the mobile app didn’t work and then after saying it didn’t work she shut off the drive through communication. Lake pleasant and happy valley location sooooo disrespectful<//Text>

I worked there at Jack n the Box m Palestine Tx. I went there today because I have a letter from the state that needs filling out. The lady that I spoke to called Victor the GM n he lied n said that I only worked there 2 days n refuses to fill out paperwork. I worked there more than 2 days and the reason I'm no longer there is because he refused to put me on schedule and when I did work was sent home early..</text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><text>Called today to complain about a non Franchise, Corporate store location in San Mateo, Ca. and sloppy appearance food presentation and small portions.

Was told, "The food pictures are just for Advertising. You know, Advertising."
So, Don't expect the food you buy to look at all like the 'Advertising only' food pictures.!

The local District Manager said the Onion Rings "are suppose to be 4 large and 4 small." I got 2 large and 7 small with 1 defective.

The Chili Cheese Burger had only about a tablespoon of chili. And this is a Corporate store!  Had the same problem with Rubio's fish taco franchise in Saratoga!

Why can't Jack use the same food pictures for Advertising to look like the food we buy in neatness and portions?

And no online website food prices? "The Franchises can charge as much as they want. And they don't have to accept any JiB Coupons."

So simple, Jack.

Update: Saturday 13 February 2021:
App no longer accepts my orders by cellphone or AX credit card!
Wow, contacting the FTC.

Nice, Jack?<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

My fiancé has gotten food poisoning from the Fullerton restaurant on harbor. Horrible customer service, I was supposed to talk to the supervisor but its been hours since I've heard from someone. Extremely disappointed, my Christmas is ruined and this is the first Christmas we are able to spend with our 5 month old daughter, but we are stuck at home now. We will not be ordering from you again.</review>

<review>Spoke with two different women so far. Ask for a district manager to call me because they royalty screwed my order, and she clearly saw on my report that I requested that the first time because she read it off to me. No call from a district manager yet and now I have to call back and ask how long it takes and now they don't want to ask the phone. Please share like I will to school and social media to get this shut down for good. If the corporate office cant fix your problems than nobody will and they obviously don't care since I'm the customer doing all my own personal follow up on THEIR MISTAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<review>False advertisement!!!! Paid for an Utimate BACON cheeseburger, received a Ultimate CRUMB scrubbed burger w/ mystery meat. Immediately after eating it my husband had excruciating stomach pain and diarrhea. I threw away my food. Service was horrible no receipt or straws provided, and when asked ALYSSA for a cup holder she rolled her eyes. She was too busy laughing with her team members and I guess we were being a nuisance by asking for a cup holder. It's not right nor is it acceptable service, she's getting paid to represent Jack in the box, which obviously is just free money for her and her team members as the food nor service meet the expectations, as they should. Picture provided under photos. LOCATION: 7740 Hazard Center Dr, San Diego, CA 92108. We always go to other locations (Mainly University ave.(they're amazing), Tierrasanta blvd.(great food always), Clairemont mesa blvd., El cajon blvd, etc...) And NEVER had an experience like this. Highly upsetting.< /review>< response>

And before anyone tells me check your food before you drive off it is that employees job at the window to make sure all the food is in the bag before they give it to you. That's what they get paid for. Anyway I was missing the Jr. BC I went and knocked on the door a lady was sitting at a table. I just wanted to bring my burger that was more than likely sitting in the warmer. But instead I was signaled to go back through the drive through that had a line around the building. Plus I called that store about 10 times... they hung up on me a couple times and didnt answer the rest of the time. No jack n the box you stole money... every penny counts you lost a customer.<//review>< pictures>

I called the number listed for the store in Paris, Tx and only received a voicemail. So I waited and called again, with the same results. I called the next day during day time hours, no answer. I sent a request on the website to see what solution that could offer, I was told I would receive a call in 2 days. I never received a call. So then they messaged me on Facebook messenger and once again promised a call back, it has been over a month and I still have not been contacted. Horrible service for making my order incorrectly and then even worse customer service for all the lies that I have been given. I would give 0 stars if possible.< /Text>< pictures>

My order for six Jack tacos was NOT prepared correctly, they were UNDERcooked and soggy and disappointing.
I wrote a review critial of how my tacos were prepared, but my review was taken out of context and DID NOT present my entire commentary on my order.

I'm VERY disappointed with taking my negative review and turning it into a positive one.   Very sneaky and does not represent my true intent of their restaurant in San Ysidro.
Do NOT order tacos from this place.   They use OLD oil to cook in and food will not crisp up correctly.   The tacos were UNDERcooked and soggy!
Reprehensible and irresponsible to take my comments out of context so that it appears I gave a good review,...when I DIDN'T!!
Owner of this franchise needs to check their morals for not reporting my entire review 😕😕🤔</review>

<text>Burnt my food to the point not eatable. Called in the inside to ask someone to come to the door since lobby closed, told me I’ll have to get back in line with other cars. 9 cars sitting in line.

<text>Jack in the box in merced ca on olive and MST has the most rudest workers ever.. I'm sorry but when you work in a customer service industry you do not talk to customers the way they do... I have complained about this restaurant before they don't clean, they are awfully rude. Someone needs to come clean house with these workers...

Thurs 0348 am.  Bedford Tx Harwood Dr location.  Male drive thru cashier wearing mask over chin and not covering mouth or nose.  Have reported to this to area management with no resolution.  I am at elevated risk for covid due to health conditions.  Im masked up but your staff will not.  This is against state mandate and unprofessional.  Please get this guy out of your store or close your doors.<//review>

<Review>Very poor customer service, management is useless if she is even there. Orders are mostly always wrong. Won't give you a refund when they screw up your order and touch all over your food with the dirty gloves that they just used to take every ones money from thru the drive through. Use this location only if you're on the verge of starving to death. It's not worth your time or money. I will never give them my service again that's for sure. Made a complaint through Corporate website let's see if it gets resolved.</Review><rating>1</rating>< user>

<Review>So it's been 5 years sense I have eaten at any fast food. I remember the last time i ate at Jack's. I got breakfast. Half the breakfast sandwich was cold. I went back today for my first time in 5 years. Same thing. Half the sandwich was cold and the egg was under cooked. Plus they got my order wrong. Mind you this is at 2 separate locations in fresno county. So I'm putting this review here I stead of two locations. I think I'll stick home cooking and would rather go hungry.< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80dbffcaeecc8e99:0x3acc5531d1256005< /GmapID>< Pictures>

No receipt available when paying. Really bad atitude of clerk. No ham available for sandwich. Really lousy place to go for good service. They act like they are doing me a favor. It seems the people they are hiring have very little training. I have gone to this resturant in Davis Ca. for over 13 years. Not anymore.<//text>

<name>J M<//name><Review>Store Manager Mena at the Scripps Poway Parkway location in Poway, CA, you caused me to make a complaint against you and that store after more than years of going there. Your terrible attitude and downright rude behavior's gotta go! Better yet, YOU gotta go! I can only imagine how you treat your employees on your self-described bad days as this one. Maybe you wouldn't have so many "bad" days if you actually learned how to lead, manage, and most importantly, listen.< /Review>< time>

I live in Phoenix Arizona. when I was a young man, I work, at three different Jack in the boxes, the last one was for a man who's name was Elton Steet. he was the best manager to work for. the jack in the box was a old one, i think they called it a mark two, something like that. they were building a new one down the street, one 27 ave and Camelback rd. anyway you have to read my post about the one one 7 st and Indian SCHOOL  rd.<//Review>

Walked in the store and they took many orders from the drive tru, when I ask why was taking so long to take my order, she got upset and she refuse to serve me, I told he I was recording the entire time I was waiting, and she shay she didn’t care, this is the kind of behavior jack in the box allowed from their employees, the video will be posted in every social media avenue I can find for people to see it with their own eyes and ears, and hopefully never eat there ever again.< /text>

Well guess what your app charged me 3 times and your corporate number says your closed during open buisness hours and any other line I get no one speaks english. So I thought let me go to the place in which I ordered from..guess what they cant do anything nor did the ever recieve the order. So your faulty app charges people for no service at all.

Drive thru ,that's a joke.They barely take your order because there are fooling around doing who knows what and they never,never answer the phone.Even the district manager doesn't give a damn.The orders are 80 percent wrong because the so called work crew can't speak English. .

Looks like some other company is using similar signage in Georgia that Jack in the Box has been using.
They are NOT Jack in the Box.

I’m not trying to be rude but some of the people there aren’t very clean looking . There is one woman that works there I don’t know her name but she is the best . She’s the one who I see painting the windows, she’s very nice and works hard. I’m glad this business opened its great .<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

The staff is friendly. They have vending machines to help serve you. I don't like going to a laundry matt. And it had been awhile since I had to go to one. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I recommend it.< /review>< Rate>

My kids (Ages 5&6) and I went in here today to wash all of our and my husbands work clothes. Upon arriving it was very busy and I wasn’t sure how I felt about it. The lady working there made our experience great soon after. She was very nice to my kids.. brought them out a couple chairs and put movies on that they picked out.  She even bought them each waters when my daughter said something about being thirsty. I never caught her name, but she’ll know who she is if she reads this. I want to personally thank her for her generosity! The dryers worked very well and the big $4 washers did a great job too. Only suggestions I have is for the washers to be able to take cards and maybe more carts available. It was clean and manageable even with all the business. Would definitely return if we’re ever back in the area.</Review>

I love this place always an employ working hard to keep achines and areas clean. There's plenty of parking and the dryers are quick. I love doing my laundry here. By far the best place to get your clothes clean in town. I notice they even do a fluff and fold for those too busy.< /text>

Great laundromat!  Staff members are very friendly and helpful. While waiting for our clothes to dry around closing time, we watched while the man on duty carefully cleaned each machine thoroughly. He really took his time and made sure they were spotless!  Definitely a pleasure to see someone with a good work ethic and paying attention to the details that make this a place you feel good about coming back to. They have my business now for sure.</text>

This place did a good job with my fluff and fold orders, the clothes were nicely folded and the service was quick. The reason for 3 stars was the employees and patrons did not wear face coverings during multiple visits. Per CA mandate they should be wearing face coverings. I won't be returning for this reason, I didn't feel safe from COVID exposure at this establishment, specifically from the employees who, when they wore a covering, wore it improperly (on chin/under nose/not at all).< /Text>

I've had to walk thru Two Female Employees that were standing on the Ramp on the side of the Building they were smoking and using foul language while one of them was on the phone. I've been there on 2 occasions and its had filthy floors and alit if Homeless just hanging out inside. I will not be coming back.<//Text><UserId.>111600864575041883053<//UserId.>< Rating>

This is by far the best laundromat I have ever used. Washing machines for every size load and plenty of dryers and they all work lol. My favorite part is the wash and fold,the pop prices are great and the girls do a fantastic job of making my stuff look good.<//Review>

<Review>Fresh rinse is by far the best in town. We've tried every laundry mat and when this building was taken over by new owners and branded fresh rinse we decided to try it out. Our clothes no longer smell funny and you know that smell your clothes get from doing it at a laundry mat; this does not happen here. Washing my clothes here is like when I had my own washer and dryer. There are TVs everywhere so we get to watch TV, listen to music and when we came in the last time the attendant Elizabeth put on cartoons for my kid and even helped me keep an eye on my kids while we were loading and unloading our clothes. Phenomenal experience. This is now our go to laundry mat for doing our clothes.<//Review><rating>5</rating><time>1588806845547< /time>< Gmap_id>

i found my new place! I Had an amazing time here while doing my laundry. !!! 5 STARS & 2 THUMBS UP!! Must try , it's so clean from the machines to the floor, this place is a must see and try. I highly recommend the FLUFF & FOLD SERVICE. Those women work so hard to keep up with the cleaning and busting out orders. I highly recommend that you ask for Elisabeth she's so sweet and very polite. I spent 3 hours with my toddlers and she was so nice and her willingness to go out of her way to help someone is absolutely refreshing to see. With everything going on, its so nice to have staff like her. My daughter absolutely loves her. Keep up the Great work Elisabeth! You deserve to be acknowledge! 5 STARS!!!</Text>

I went to The Fresh Rinse for the first time today and will definitely go again. I was impressed with cleanliness of the laundromat (including the restroom), the multiple (large!) TVs and the various sized washing machines and dryers. I haven’t seen a washing machine that will do 9 loads of laundry at a time before. The dryers were also huge! The prices were reasonable. This is my new favorite laundromat in Oroville. Definitely recommend!</Text>

< review>
I seldom use laundromats but I needed to because my dryer is down..  I decided to stop here to do laundry and was surprised in a really pleasant way.  I've never been to a cleaner one with so many different size washers and dryers.  The owner Jordan was friendly and knowledgeable.  When the snack machine robbed me of my dollar he made it right and had the attendant put in another for me to purchase my daughter's snack.  While waiting for one of my washer loads to finish in order to start my dryer with my load in it another customer made me feel uncomfortable.  I asked the attendant, Angela if my stuff would be safe in the dryer if I ran another errand.  Like Jordan the owner, Angela was also friendly and helpful and said she'd keep an eye out until I came back.  When I returned 20 minutes later my laundry was done and still safe inside the machine.  I give them 5/5 stars all around for wonderful customer service, cleanliness, and knowledge. Fast and cheaper than doing laundry at my complex.  Highly recommend to anyone doing laundry in Oroville.< /review>

Very nice place for a laundry mate. The  machines are new and work great. They also have laundry service. Dryers are 25 cents for  6 minutes.  Dried three loads for a quarter.<//Review>

The place has been clean, machines
are operating efficienctly ( only washer
doors out of service( do to they’re little
different compare to usual coin laundry
washers) in fact they’re easier or simple
once you realize it’s not as much effort
to learn washer and dryer ( or etiquette)

The goal the owners have are to service
the community and not themselves!

Thank you Fresh Rinse owners and
employees! I have a safe, clean and
Community environment to just
be away from the more convenient
cheaper alternative where I live!

Being closer if at apts it was provided free
It’s no better!

Waited patiently for this place to open!!! Did not disappoint at all! Clean..Clean...Clean. ALL washers and dryers work, smells good and there’s a great staff here and you don’t get in trouble if you accidentally shut the door to the machines to hard...Anybody who’s been to the other ones here in town knows what I’m talking about. Super pumped to have this open! Keep up the great job: )</Text>

Your more than welcome to let our attendant know you would like the next washer that comes available.  Your wait would be very short but if your in a hurry then the you’ll have to go with the machines that are available!  Thanks for the review!'}<//resp>

<Text>Their worker Lee is so upbeat and ready to go! You can tell she loves her job.
I wasn’t sure about how fluff and folds work and what not she made me feel very confident that my things would be safe in their hands.
I will be coming with baskets next pay check! Thankyou for your awesome customer service.
More places in oroville need workers like you.<//Text>< Name>

All of our machines are brand new and we always have an attendant on duty to assist our customers from 7am-11pm.  It costs us a little extra to keep the place safe and clean and to offer brand new equipment. Thank you for your feedback.'}< /Response>

They have envelopes and claim forms outside if you are missing some. Drop off box is inside easy to locate. Small office. I had no problems.< /Review>

<review>They are very knowledgeable about claiming your ticket I had a chance to speak to a sales representative over the phone they explain to me how it work and gave the address to the claims office I look forward meeting one of the  representatives soon because if you don’t play you don’t win “please”play responsible,Respectfully Brian C.

Descent collection of fresh Asian veggies. We live in Ukiah, so having access to an Asian grocery store is nice. They have a nice collection of Vietnamese groceries.

The coconut milk and cream is reasonably priced at 1 dollarish a piece.</review>

I'm impressed with how the products are so clean and well organized here you may not find stuff rare Asian ethnic ingredients you areooking for here because they seem to have such tiny space but overall they carrying pretty basic items you need for  daily basis cooking. One thing I found quite annoying was none price labeled on most items. Pretty skeptical.</text>

The service is great but there’s usually a wait because there’s only one cashier.  I’m always getting the spicy noodles there and I always leave with more than intended.< /text>

<review>Too expensive and there was many expired products. Plus they used expired shrimp to cook then sell it as ‘cooked shrimp ‘ which is nasty.
Long wait and only one cashier but no room to stand.<//review>< pics>

<Text>This is one of my favorite local shops! The owners are a kind couple, and they're always super welcoming to me and my son. They fry fresh fish, cut up huge jackfruits, and stock lots of chinese and other asian vegetables that my family loves. I will admit that some of the of their items are overpriced, but I'd rather support a local business than order a single ingredient online to get ship a million miles and get to me in a month. Also, many goods they have are usually hard to find in any other store, and I love being able to find them right across the street.< /Text>< gmapID>

<Text>They sold expired foods. I went there in July to get Kimchi and their Kimchi was expired in October 2017. And when I told the owner that I want to exchange, she told me to grab a new one. I grabbed the more expansive Kimchi because they only have two kinds the new one I got and the Expired Kimchi; She said I had to pay more and she didn’t allow me to use credit card to pay if it’s under 10. So I had to go around to pick some more stuff to fill up to $10 to only get the UNEXPIRED KIMCHI. Horrible service!! It is not my fault that I bought their expired food and what I get back is PAYING MORE. Rediculous! There is no customer service at all.

They use raw shrimp that is going to expire to cook it then sell it as ‘cooked shrimp’ to get some cash from foods that is going to expire!!! So be careful of those cooked shrimps.
Things are pricey there too. I only go there when I really need stuff to buy from them.

She always asked about my private details too like How much money I make at work ? bla bla... !!??? How much my husband make?

Also she gave other lady many bags but she only packed my everything in only 1 bag and the food was upside-down and fell everywhere in the bag. What is going on with her?</Text>< rate>

Has lots of hard to get Asian cooking supplies and ingredients... but you should know what you want or about the items before you go there... not much knowledge of their own products, and it's a bit pricey...< /review>

<Text>These guys saved our butts! 2am on a 2,000 mile road trip and our trailer axle breaks 2 hrs from home. Towed our trailer to their lot on a flatbed and we came and got it the next day. I highly recommend the guys at Black Butte Towing! Great guys to help you out of anything situation.<//Text>< gmapID>

<Review>I foolishly got stuck in a snow bank & unfortunately learned what "high centered" means (believe me, you are better off not finding this out first hand). AAA was amazingly *un*helpful, between the automated phone menu that inexplicably does not feature "Emergency Roadside Service" as an option (Claims will get you there, for future reference) and the unavailability of their contract tower.

Thankfully the CHP referred us to Black Butte and Jeff, both of whom were fantastic. Friendly, efficient and they communicated with us throughout which was very reassuring since we were stuck in a remote area & facing a night spent in the truck if no one towed us.

Can't say enough good things - worth every penny and would absolutely use them again (but hope I don't need to).</Review>< Pics>

They are the best! Kind, generous, smart, understanding. They have what it takes to succeed thru any storm and long, long into the future. A truly strong business with heart.< /Review>

Quick to respond and very helpful. He even took the time to watch for the low clearance on the car. Was a rough morning for us so we appreciated the good customer service</review>

<Review>Brain was amazing. Our car had problems at Old Ski Bowl trail head. Brain came all the way to the top to get us. Enjoyed a pleasant conversation on our ride down. He gave recommendations for in Shasta where to bring the car and helped us find the key drop box. Really helpful in a time when we were totally stranded. Definitely give them a call to help you out! The other plus was the price was great!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x54ce74c98e98b45d:0x7ccead6b8eadee09< /Gmap_id></record>

<user_id>100134055344191336703</user_id><Review>Had an excellent experience with Zach, who quickly arrived to the very out of the way and tough to get to spot I was stuck in, and winched me out in an efficient, very knowledgeable manner. With his easy going and calm presence, I immediately felt safe and good again. I got quoted for $1,200 from another 24/7 company in the area, and that made my jaw drop. Then I found Black Butte Towing, who took great care of me for a whooping 1/6th of that price. Thank you again!!<//Review>< date>

But paying an original tow fee, okay good. But having to pay a days storage fee when it was towed late night and picked up first thing in the am and charged a days storage fee for less that 24 hours is a bit ridiculous. They have to make their money someway. I would never use them personally<//Review>< pics>

I was stuck on I5 in Dunsmuir in a snow storm last Tuesday and couldn’t get a local towing company to get me. Justis was a long way from me but he let me know he was headed my way and called me regularly to check on me as he made his way down from Weed. The highway was all blocked up but he eventually got to me and got me safely off the highway and to a motel. He was wonderful!</text>

Our transmission went out on Highway 5 - called Black Butte Towing and they were INCREDIBLY friendly, extremely helpful and very fair priced! ZACK picked us up and took such good care of us from the moment he picked us up to the very end!  THANK YOU ZACK! We definitely owe you!<//Text>

<Review>Brian picked us up in the middle of a winter storm. Our truck was pulling our travel trailer had thrown a shoe (chains). The chains must of broke my brake line. Brain was fast, the truck was clean and he took us to a safe location to wait for the service on a late Saturday night.

I met Brian about 16-17 years ago. When I was on an adventure. He helped me get the parts I needed for my 1978 Dodge Van. We got to talking, and he told me , when I got done with my adventure to come back and he would give e me a job driving truck for him. I regret not going back. But I think of him often. I wonder if he even remembers me. Brian your the best</text>

<Text>Wednesday night in the middle of no where, after driving hours with my one year old son from evacuating the Atlas fire, I stopped at a rest stop along the way. I accidentally locked my son in the car. After calling 911 and waiting with a very kind officer, the tow truck driver came. He got my car unlocked immediately and when he heard what had happened he didn't charge me, he was so kind ❤ I can not express how the officer and driver were amazing. Thank you so much. I wish I got their names.<//Text>< response>

I have been to this location several times and have always had outstanding customer service,  but today was beyond exceptional.. I was on a deadline for a  project, when I came in Tavion was very attentive and welcomed me with a friendly greeting, he helped me with everything I needed and with no hesitation and so much patience.  When we realized what I needed and it could not be done on the self print computer,  Precious the manager of the store had walked me to the front counter and helped me with exactly  with what I needed and I was able to print the exact items I needed. Tavion and Precious and 2 of the nicest people I have encountered in a very long time... From now on this will be my number one place to go for any kind of printing and shipping needs.<//text>

Do not *EVER* trust this FedEx with a print job—I mean it. I printed a manuscript with them (300+ pages) and they managed to screw it up in multiple places. Pages missing everywhere. Because it was over 300 pages, I had to read through to discover them. The first issue: they left 6 pages off the end. I had to go in 3x to have this issue fixed. They wasted hours of my life. Now a couple days later, I'm reading through and I discover another FIFTEEN PAGES missing from the middle. I'm livid. I called into corporate customer service and they claimed that management would follow up with me (no follow-up yet, four days later).
Do not give this location money. If you can avoid it, don't give FEDEX money. They have not once offered any kind of refund, coupon, nothing for all my trouble.< /Text>

<Text>It can be a challenge during rush hour traffic to get into the parking lot, on the other hand it allows you to have easy in and out for drop off at FedEx packages. There are not a lot of customers in the store at any given time, so the Fed ex representatives have a lot of time to give to you and focus on your shipping needs. I highly recommend the store I’ve been using them for over 5 years.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPp6g06k-zn2N5n1L3Uwwh2q-jzMY5Y--PfRWx9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dd31d1e5f089ab:0xfa86e5cc8fd41dbb</gmapID></record>

Today I went into this store location for the first time. I spoke with an employee named Colin, and I asked him if I could make 25 copies of a document that I had in my email. To my surprise, from the moment I walked through the door, he was very frustrated with me for no apparent reason. I could see him greeting other customers walking behind me as they left and entered the store, but the reaction I recieved was somewhat cold. I asked him if I could make any changes to my document before he began printing, saying  "Can I make any changes to my document before I print?" he replied, " Oh, you want to come to my company computer, we don't allow that. But you can make changes on your phone and send it!"  As if my service was a waist of his time and energy. I went ahead and made the adjustments using my cell phone, and I finally was able to resend the document to his company email. He stood their for about 10 minutes on his computer, completely disregarding me before I finally asked, "Has my document made it to you?". And he then decided to start working on my copy. I went on to ask, " Are you able to print copies in different sizes?" He abruptly said, "Oh we would have to cut it for you, but that would be another charge!"..I replied, "Oh, that's fine I can cut the document"..and he angrily said, " Well I'm just trying to let you know!". At that point I felt very hurt, and prejudged because he assumed that because I am a young black female that I would be naturally aggressive toward him, while in reality I am very kind and soft spoken. I don't want anyone to feel how he made me feel today. I felt so uncomfortable, at that point, one copy was enough, I just said Thank you and left.< /review>

<text>I've had good luck here in the past. They've always happened to be available to print my last minute, high maintenance orders in less time than I predicted. And they've also been friendly and encouraging even while I was stressed. Today I needed a quick turn around of color 2" x 6" bookmarks and Stephanie was calm and helpful! She's getting them done in 1.5 hours. Not bad. *thumbs up*</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

It should have been refused before it got to me. The store clerk was rude. There is a UPS store right down the street and they are always friendly and don't act like they are above you as a customer. What does it take to smile and say; "Hi how can I help you!" Never again. I'm done with this company.

I was excited to see the cut off time for next day shipping in state was 7:30.   I ship packages next day from my company at least  11 times a month.   Well I have a total of 3 packages not scanned in the correct time when I dropped it off well before cut off time.   And now packages with time sensitive  material being rcvd days later.  They are pleasant employees but seem very under staffed.   I am very disappointed I will be not going to this location any longer I will still stick with my drop box which I have had no trouble with and if I am running late I will visit an actual Fed Ex facility.<//review>

This past Tuesday, February 9, trying to find a quiet spot to make a phone call away from all the noise proved to be impossible.  That's because the rude,fat, bald, slow employee at the service desk felt it was MORE URGENT to scream at me that I should step out of the "NON-CUSTOMER ZONE" I was in than to continue helping his line of 5-6 customers.  This was even AFTER one of the drivers told me I was fine using that spot.   Needless to say, I'll never set foot in there again.<//review>

I've worked in retail and owned a coffee house and ANYBODY working/owning a retail shop of any kind  should know that the first thing and least thing you do is acknowledge the presence of a customer.

I stood there waiting around 20 minutes (from the time I walked in to the time I left) while these two girls stood near the office talking about who knows what but they NEVER looked my way as I was standing at the service counter.

Then when one of them walked out she was asked a question by a girl making copies, the employee's response was "I'm really busy now and that will have to wait". Then the two employees stood within 5 feet of me at the service counter and discussed Bus schedules again never making eye contact. I felt like my presence was a nuisance to them.

A simple nod "hello I see you" would have help some but I guess that was below them.

Pretty sure I'll never use ANY FedEx Office again< /Text>

<review>They try and upsell you on a new shipping box and container and packing material so that they can make money off of you, when your box and your packing material are perfectly fine.  BS- UPS all the way.  Lost a customer for life.  It's not your business what is in my box, or how it is packed.

Update, two months later it is only worse. Not only is the above still accurate, but they do not accept any electronics boxes unless it says HP on it. So if you're shipping anything Dell, IBM, Cisco, or any other electronic device that is not HP they will not accept the box.  This is hilarious to me, because I am returning a device to Dell with a label they provided me however FedEx will not ship Dell boxes. What in the world is going on here?!< /review><userid>110316380129909194891</userid><response>None< /response>< date>

Very slow with bad customer service.

The employees are friendly when you first walk through the door, but it's all bad from there. I only go to this location to pick up packages because I live in a condo building and FedEx never delivers to my door. The employees work very slow as if if they really don't want to be there. The last time I went there it took me 35 minutes total from walking in to walking out with my package. I did not other shopping except wait in line that had 2 people ahead of me. There were 4 employees working but only one was dealing with customers, very slow I might add. The other employees were just sitting there as if they were hoping they were suddenly invisible or something. Once I finally got to the counter it took 7-8 minutes to find my package out of the 10 that were waiting to be picked up. I even received a call from them so they knew where it was exactly as some point. The last time I had any dealings with this location was when my wife had to pick up the package for me. We have the same last name and the exact same address on our drivers licenses. FedEx said that by law they are not allowed to give a package to someone who is not addressed on the label. After a 20 minute argument they finally "broke the law" and let my wife sign for it.< /Text>

Standing in line, overhead a rep tell customers that their package won't ship, unless they purchase their boxes (box within a box). Tried to to sell me as well. Took my items to the Fedex off of Palos Verdes.<//Review>

<Text>This store was soooo good back in the day when it was Kinko's.  Now?  Very little is offered, the prices are high, and the customer service . . . well, I want to say it's an oxymoron.  Not strictly, but it is awful.  I will never go back.</Text>< Name>

<text>I'm a friendly, outgoing person.  I go out of my way to be pleasent in social interactions.  I don't enjoy giving negative feedback, but I'm going to do it today.
I've been to this location about 4 times total in the last 2 months.  I've never
had any problems or felt annoyed until today.
It's Dec 17 so people are busy mailing things and it was busy.
I understand so I was waiting in line and trying to be understanding.  I'm not sure if
the Manager Riva was brought in to improve income, but every person that was in line was told they would have to replace at least one box or envelope and in some places they would need to re-pack everything at a higher charge. It didn't seem like anyone else was trusted on the register.  There were about 6 other people working but she's the only one ring up and repacking right there. Now everyone had already waited 30-45minutes to get up there to be upsold.  I just refused and took the book they wanted to make me buy another envelope for and took it to the post office.

The icing on the cake was Riva speaking loudly to an employee that she needed
to review her clocking in and out because she didn't do it correctly.  Then she added
"So when you clock out you have to stop working right?"
So inapproperate for her to do this in front of customers.  It really undermined
her staff being respected.

I would like to say a very nice work about a young man who had waited on me towards the end of this transaction and in past visits.He really goes out of his way to be helpful.  I think his name is Jason or
at least starts with a "J".  He should be promoted and given a raise<//text><Time>1355807826381<//Time><Gmap_id>0x80dd31d1e5f089ab:0xfa86e5cc8fd41dbb< /Gmap_id><resp>None<//resp><Pics>None< /Pics>< Name>

<Review>FedEx SmartPost is the best thing since chips and salsa, but for the love of God, the retail locations need to STOP being so uptight about our shipping being in a brown box.  It is NOT a corporate standard because the drivers NEVER complain.   It is a huge scam to charge customers who've already paid for their label, to rebox their packages in boxes bought from the retail location for exhorbitantly increased prices.   And this location is severely understaffed most every time I go in.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>I went there a couple times and this one young dude was nice and helped me what I needed to do and answered all my questions with a friendly attitude...he seemed kinda new but doing a great job...but there was this one black chick she just seemed like she just didn't wanna be there. She had a grumpy attitude and just very unapproachable...(felt like "PoPcopy" from chappelle show)... made you feel like you were bothering her if u had a question...one time I left my id in the copy machine and I called her on the phone to check for me ...she took my name and number down and said she'd check and call back...assuming she was very busy I decided to drive all the way over there to check myself and sure enough it wasn't busy and she was just chillin behind the counter literally 10ft away from the copy machine I was using and I went and grabbed my id from the copy machine and was still there...I was like are u kidding me???< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>As most fedex shops are understaffed and unorganized, this one is no different. I waited in line 20 minutes before the employee could help me. I just needed to ship a package to a friend. Poor guy had to multitask between 6 customers, not able to focus on one at a time. I feel bad for the one employee. He did his best and was friendly enough though. Fedex business model for several years has been to slash costs to keep the profit up. I hope the greedy pinheads at the top go out of business.  I just feel bad for the employees that are stretched thin and are taken advantage of. Will never return to this location, and will avoid giving Fedex my business at all costs.</Review>< Pics>

I ship frequently and often, the same products, the same packaging (retail box inside a standard US Letter mailer.

I normally ship USPS, sometimes UPS, today a customer specifically asked for overnight FedEx.

When I arrive in the store, the 2 lovely ladies were more interested in their conversation about nothing, than the customer.

This was then followed by this lady giving me false information on pricing and packaging terms as she wanted to upsell me. I was nott having her lies. She wanted her $5 packing money, and there was no way she was going to follow FedEx policies or give me the correct price. She tried to sell me the wrong service at the wrong price.

I started calling her on her crap and she then asked me to leave. So I took her picture and she ran away to the back of the store - SHE KNEW SHE WAS LYING.

I took my package to the place on Redondo and 4th, where they may not be the cheapest, but my blood didn't boil and I got serviced as I had wanted to.

Shame on you FedEx for letting bad franchisees like this damage your business. This was your day to convince me and my business you could match the service of your competitors and you failed the test.

I had a bad experience in there once before, that's me done with that FedEx store. There is nothing like feeling so unwelcome as you part with your hard earned money.<//text>

I spoke to someone by the name of Mrs. Blake, and she was not helpful, and quite rude on the phone.  I managed to get her to provide me with an email that I can send me quote order request, this was on 6/30/15.  Today, 7/1/15 I have not heard from them yet, I called again and got the same person by the name of Mrs. Blake, again rude, I asked for her supervisor and it felt like I was pulling teeth.  I have already followed up with an email follow-up and it was read by someone at Kinkos, because on the email I requested READ reply back to me.  NOT A GOOD PLACE TO SHOP!  PROBABLY UNDERSTAFFED!!</Text>

<Review>Phenomenal time! I am not a beginner surfer and was looking to fine tune some skills and learn some new ones. I also ended up getting the photo package. The whole session was worth every penny. Good photos and I did pick up a few good pointers to improve my surf. You could tell sharing the stoke with the beginner surfers and the experienced surfers was all Marty's passion. Marjan took some great photographs and the communication with the team throughout booking and experience was great. I was only in town for one day, but will definitely be back. Attached are some of the photos from they took.< /Review><rating>5<//rating>< name>

<Review>Brandon and the whole team was great! I would recommend to anyone looking to surf. Brandon took the time to make sure I was safe, and patiently and carefully taught me, and I stood up  at the end of the lesson! I had a blast! Definitely plan to go back on my next California trip!< /Review>< name>

I had to rearrange a couple of times due to work commitments and the process was super easy.  On the day the whole team were friendly and laid back but professional.  My husband really enjoyed the lesson and as we are new to Los Angeles it was a great way for him to find out local information about the best spots to surf and to dust off the cobwebs.  He picked up some good technique tips and is feeling sore today, in a good way! Would highly recommend for beginners as well as intermediates wanting to get back into surfing< /Review><username>andrea leonard< /username><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

I've taken surf lessons in multiple cities from multiple groups and Kapowui was by far the best.

We went over all the foundations from what part of the surfboard is what, and how to stand on it/turn to mastering each part of the pop up before getting into the water. Then, when we did, surfing was much easier for me than ever and it felt like second nature.

The staff is also so friendly that even people on the beach who weren't taking a lesson with them and asked them questions got answers and they couldn't have been happier to help.

Would never take another lesson anywhere else. It was fun, I learned a lot, and feel way more comfortable on a surf board. Don't forget to add their photographer to your lesson - she takes amazing pics! A++<//Review>

<review>Excellent experience for our son for his first ever lesson. Everything was spot on from the email updates and where to find Kapowui at the beach. Made it easy. Claudio was a fantastic instructor and our son was up on the board with his first attempt. He does have a lot of other boarding experience which helped but Claudio spent time before going in the water to make sure he explained the basics.  Claudio spent the entire time in the water without his board instructing, helping to catch waves and be a terrific teacher. The staff was welcoming and ran a great experience from start to finish. I also appreciated that the other guy who was in our lesson showed up 30 mins late, and they didn’t make our son wait for that guy to “catch up”. Highly recommend!<//review>< Pictures>

I took my first surf lessons with Edwardo and I am hooked on surf. Edwardo is a phenomenal instructor and experienced surfer (34 years!). He was very thorough in explaining the fundamentals and also payed very close attention to my movements so that he could correct my positions. I saw progress within two lessons and cannot wait to come back for more. The owner Martin is such a great guy and went out of his way to make sure that I was satisfied with my experience.< /Review>

I can't say enough wonderful things about our experience with Kapowui. From our initial booking, Martin was super helpful in finding the best time for our daughters based on their ages and the tide. We had clear instructions on where to go, including tips on beating traffic and parking. Edwardo was our instructor who felt like a fun uncle to our girls and gave everyone in our party of 5 plenty of attention. Martin made us feel so comfortable and part of the squad, our girls had such a blast we rented gear from them the next day and surfed the entire day. Highly recommend!!<//Review>

My friends and I were in town for a week and our 5 kids (ages 9 - 15) were dying for a lesson.  They took 2 group private lessons with Eduardo who was fantastic.  He is clear, cares about safety and makes it fun!  They were all standing on their boards by the end, it was amazing — and they all can’t wait to get back to surf!  Highly recommend!!</text>

I just had my first lesson with Eduardo and it was so much fun!!! Eduardo was extremely patient and gave gentle suggestions and tips to make the most out of our lesson. Also, as a larger sized woman, I was worried about how inclusive surfing was but Kapowui was great, they had a wide range of wetsuits and Eduardo definitely was in tune with our needs. We will definitely book again very soon!<//Text>

Such a nice and patient guy, he spared no energy in demonstrating “pop up’s” on the beach, and then put me into some good waves.   Being a surf instructor appears to be a tremendous exertion, but Eduardo kept guiding and pushing my board, advising and generally placing me into the best position to learn lots and have fun.  He also conveyed something of the convivial and communal ethos of the beach and the school, taking time to tell me about the other surfers and their life stories.   Kapowui was a delightful introduction into the mysterious rituals of surfing.<//Review><rating>5<//rating>< Response>

My group of three had an amazing time taking our first surf lesson with Clay at Kapowui! We messed up the dates and were 30 minutes late, but the staff was friendly and accommodating, and we were in the water with no rush fifteen minutes later, and were able to keep surfing blast the original end time. We all rode waves by the end of the lesson thanks to Clay’s laid back and attentive teaching! Clay is a great teacher and the perfect surfing mentor to help new surfers learn how to surf. We will definitely be back.< /Text>

I paid for a 2 hr surf lesson with Todd and I gotta say I had an awesome experience for it being my first time surfing. Todd made sure to explain everything to me clearly and with a true teacher’s spirit. I feel like the adjustments he had me do in the water after noticing my tendencies helped me a lot in actually riding the wave as well as helped my confidence on my next attempts. Overall, the whole crew that greeted me were great people, sociable, and laid back. (And I loved their cocker spaniel). I would definitely pay for more lessons in the future if I get the chance.</Text>

My son had been wanting to do surfing lessons for quite some time and we were finally able to fly out of Houston and head to California for him to enjoy some beach time. Todd and Claudio were great instructors and really took the time to make sure my son, who is only 9, felt comfortable with the movements and made sure that it was a good birthday experience for him. Even when my son got frustrated trying to get the movements down in the sand, they continued to work with him until he got it right. His first time riding the waves, he stood up on his surfboard and rode it all the way to the shore! Their energy and positivity was great and you can tell that with all of the employees, helping people have the best surfing experience possible really is their passion. The only part I was bummed about was the purchase of the GOPRO. Once we received the SD cards, the files were corrupted, BUT when I brought this to the owners attention he immediately offered a number of solutions and gave me a refund for the hassle. The next time I am in California I am definitely going to book with them again!</text>

I walked up to Martin's van, without prior appointment, and was immediately able to rent a board. I told him that I was a total beginner and I wanted to get thrashed by the waves without any tutoring. He gave me the most important pointers about safety, then he let me go surfing. I really liked his attitude,  he did not berate me for not taking a lesson and that was awesome. Of course I wasn't able to stand on the board at all, but I had my fun and Martin was very kind to point out some possible errors once I asked him why the boards nose would dip into the water all the time. I will come back and try surfing without a tutor again. At one point I will get a course to beat all my self trained errors out of me though.</Text>

Best experience ever. I took a lesson with JC, and he is one of the coolest people I’ve met. He was so enthusiastic, positive, and thoughtful. He made me feel proud of myself during the lesson and i am now in love with surfing. He was very courteous about covid—he gets tested every week and he asked multiple times if we were okay with being in close contact during the part of the lesson that is in the water (which is kind of required for a beginner surf lesson). He spent a perfect amount of time demonstrating basic mechanics before we got into the water so that we would know what to do. As per the company itself, they were super kind and accommodating, and they gave us full-length, rinsed and dry wetsuits (which was something that another company didn’t do, which was very uncomfortable). They also rent suits and boards if you want to keep surfing after the lesson. SUCH a great experience, and i already scheduled another lesson for next week. 11/10 recommend!!!<//text>

I booked a last minute surfing lesson for my girlfriend and I’s 2 year anniversary, they got us in a lesson no problem! Tyler was an awesome instructor and got us as much time in the water as possible, we felt extremely welcomed and had an absolute blast! Kapowui definitely embodies the surfing spirit, my girlfriend and I will absolutely be back out catching some waves with the skills they taught us! Thank you!</Review>

Ed was an amazing instructor and made my first time surfing ever so rewarding! He was very informative, receptive to all my questions and was refreshingly comforting whenever I felt a little nervous. I caught a handful of good waves for my first time thanks to Ed! I felt safe and well looked after. He was so encouraging the whole session and me feel amazing about my decision. Thank you Kapowui for making my surfing dreams come true! Hope to catch you guys out there 🤙🏽🤙🏽<//Review>

I've taken 3 lessons with Kapowui so far (once with Liam and twice with Todd) and my surfing experience has been super awesome every time. The instructors have a lot of knowledge to share about the waves and how to surf. I had a great time in the water with them and they give feedback on every attempted wave which really helped to remind me what to focus on. I asked tons of questions to help me visualize and understand the wave science and they had answers for all of them which was super helpful. I would definitely recommend Kapowui over other schools that were just kinda "meh" in my opinion.<//review>

Connor was an all out fantastic instructor. Went with my friend for our first time. Just moved out to LA from the East coast and we were surfing up and riding just minutes after his detailed lesson. His instruction was attentive and attitude on top. Thanks Connor and Martin at Kapowui. We’ll be back< /review>

Thank you to Connor and Martin for an awesome lesson. Because both myself and the other person in my lesson had some minimal surfing experience, I really appreciated how quickly we got in the water to start honing our skills practically. It was a great morning and I hope to be back in the future!< /Review>

They run a very smooth and efficient operation with an incredibly friendly and knowledable staff. This was my friend and I's very first time getting on a surf board and our instructor really broke everything down to make it simple to understand. Definitely a little nervewracking at first, but SO MUCH FUN and SO WORTH IT! Didn't expect to be so sore afterwards, but we have a new hobby that we can't wait to continue to do this summer! Thank you guys so much!!< /Text>

I had a fantastic time with Ed (THANK YOU!).

He helped me mentally relax and just enjoy the process and have fun, - because this is why we want to surf and stress won't lead us anywhere. He was very specific at explaining and correcting my mistakes and equipping me with valuable advices to help me get better at surfing day-by-day, wave-by-wave.

Looking forward to more classes!</text>

I'm super happy I chose this location to do my surfing training!! Todd and Marjan were absolutely amazing!! Marjan made sure I got the best price deal I could get and she went out of her way to do so! Todd was such an amazing and informational instructor I left him a tip! (which is not required) but it goes to show how helpful, patient, and full of great energy he was! I purchased the go-pro to have clipped onto my surfboard. You will need a card reader to watch your shots but I'm excited to have actual footage. I even managed to catch more than 4 or 5 waves which, for a beginner, is freaking awesome! I learned how to paddle as well. I'm from North Carolina but whenever I visit I Will certainly be coming again and again! - E !<//text>

Super easy process from booking to getting into the water! Even on a day where it might not have been the most ideal conditions, I felt like my instructor did his best to make sure I knew what I was doing and to get me on a couple waves. Highly recommend Kapowui!</Review>

<Review>Absolutely awesome people. I signed up for a lesson, and was all set in no time. As the day of lesson drew closer, Kapowui did a great job sending up follow up email reminders of where to meet, and who my instructor would be. The meet up instructions were spot on, and they had everything ready for me. I just needed to arrive with my swim shorts. My instructor Edwardo made the instructions very clear, and was very patient. Thanks to his practical drills before we got in the water, and his continued encouragement, I caught the wave on the first attempt. The price for a 2 hour lesson was extremely fair. I WILL be using them again, and encourage everyone to go with Kapowui for lessons.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>So much fun! Took a two hour lesson with Todd. The day we were scheduled was really windy and rough. After about 30 minutes in the water Todd suggested we resume our lesson the following day, no extra charge. The conditions were much better the next day and Todd's instruction was great. Can't wait to be back in LA to do this again!<//review><user_name>Melissa Anderson</user_name>< Rate>

Had the most amazing lesson with Liam who was very patient and knowledgeable! I was a total beginner but feel 100x less intimidated to go out into the water. Highly recommend for anyone staying in LA and wants to join in on the fun ☺️🏄‍♀️</Text>

If you are looking for a surf lesson, this is definitely the way to go. I had an amazing experience. The staff are extremely kind and are with you the whole time throughout the lesson. I got up my first time on the water. I wanted to learn how to surf for my birthday and I am so glad I came here.  They even sang happy birthday to me in two languages. I am definitely returning for more lessons in the future. I can't imagine a better way to learn.</review>

Wow, what a fun and great experience!! I recently moved to California from Michigan and the only thing I wanted to do as soon as possible was to go surfing! I had never been surfing so I was extra excited. I had a 1 on 1 lesson with Eduardo and it was the highlight of my time since being in California. Eduardo is very knowledgeable, practiced great safety measures, caring, and overall just a really fun time! Everything from the beginning of the lesson, including the crew at the van, did not disappoint with the positive vibes. Highly recommend and will for sure visit again when I’m in the area!< /Review>

This was an amazing experience.  Highly recommend to any family wanting to learn together.  Ask for Todd and do the 1.5 hours.  Todd was a fantastic instructor and all six of us were standing on the board riding waves by the end of the lesson.  Can not recommend it enough!</Text>

Martin is an actual legend!!!! This was a great experience, and super convenient. Martin, our instructor, was kind, patient and was really invested in our time out in the water. He was also super respectful of our space and comfortable with keeping masks on whilst we were having the land portion of the lesson. Totally recommend him and Kapowui, definitely coming back for another lesson< /Text>

Definitely recommend this surf school whether trying it out for fun or wanting to get more in to surfing.

Alex was my trainer and he was incredibly professional and knowledgeable. He went through all the basics to build a really strong foundation to learn how to surf.

Setting up the lesson couldn’t have been easier and they are really on the ball with everything and make it a really great experience. Will definitely be going back for more lessons.</Review>

I highly recommend Kapowui! We started taking our teens there this summer and it's been amazing! Most instructors are life long surfers, very knowledgeable, and super friendly. For beginners and beyond there is alway something to be learned. It's fun for small groups of 2-4 and 1 on 1 instruction. The iconic VW bus piled high with surfboards says it all and Marjan is all things operations and a dream to work with.< /review>

This was my first time surfing, and hands down the best experience. Todd was awesome walking through the basics of surfing, instructing me through every wave, and making it fun out in the ocean. The time flew by. Will definitely be back, and highly recommend anyone looking to learn how to surf or improve their skills. 10/10</Text>

My buddy took me to surf some waves on my birthday today! Best experience I’ve had being my first time being on a surf board. Todd and Tai were great instructors. They were extremely patient and full of energy (That alone made the experience that MUCH better). For anyone looking to get some waves in, definitely suggest you guys reach out !</Text>

<Text>With my recent move to the West coast, I was super excited to try out surfing! Kapowui had great reviews and had a really easy online booking service so I went with them. I had the two hour session with some friends and they went over the basics and safety precautions before we got out to the water. Edwardo was a super fun instructor and he did a great job of helping us get up on the boards during our first lesson! Boards and gear were all provided! Would definitely come back for future lessons!</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

My kids (10 year old girl, 14 year old boy) had an awesome first lesson here with Eduardo and Ty. The on-the-beach session was concise and complete and gave the kids enough info to ride successfully in the water. Both instructors were super cool and supportive and got the kids into too many waves to count during the session. They made the kids' first lesson great and the kids are asking when they can go again. Thanks, Kapowui!< /Text>

My two hour lesson with my 3 friends was amazing! Todd was super friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. He was patient and talked us through instructions every step the of the way.

Moved here from Chicago but I was always intimidated with the ocean and steep learning curve compared to skateboarding and snowboarding so I didn’t know what to expect.  Connor gave me clear instructions on the beach. In the water, I did what he told me and was able to pop up with him pushing me into the waves, then me paddling into them. I was able to catch so many waves during my 2 hr lesson I was exhausted. I feel he gave me enough tools to try on my own next time but would to take another lesson if needed. Can’t wait to get back out there, highly recommended, thanks guys!</review>< Pics>

<text>This was my first time ever! I took an 1.5 hour class with Corey which was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about surfing. He explained the sport to me and taught me everything I needed to learn. 30 minutes later, I am already riding the waves and was able to stand up from the first time! I also got a cool pic for my Instagram 😎 Thanks Corey! I’ll definitely recommend kapowui to everyone I know :)< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8Ga4mLk80-5WZLVMK02pj8RPet4WbRcRx8amy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Review>We had Todd and he was great. He was so much fun and he really helped me build up my confidence by the end of our session I felt like a real surfer! Would definitely recommend this company and Todd to anyone. I will also be back for more sessions! Thank you for a great time and experience.</Review>< response>

<Review>I chose Kapowui based on all the 5 star reviews and now I have to give them 5 more stars! We really enjoyed our lesson. It was easy to find the van and there was lots of parking available. Instructor Clay made sure we had the mechanics down on the beach and then helped us get going in the water, telling us when to go. Neither one of us was any good at it, but he was very patient with us. We were first-timers and had no idea how exhausting and hard surfing is, but we had so much fun! I really give it a 10/5 and I 100% plan to take a lesson with them again next time I'm in the area!<//Review>< pictures>

<review>The team is just great and the way they doing business is about sharing their experience and making people feel excited every single time they surf.
All instructors are very professional. You can definitely get how to surf during the first lesson.
I am so happy I got Eduardo who taught me how to surf. After a package of 5 lessons I can catch the ways on my own. But be patient, you will fall and that’s okay, nothing is easy. Professionals fall all the time too. That’s okay to spend one hour in the water and catch 1-3 waves, it’s definitely worth it.

Thanks guys, I felt in love with surfing.

My kids (12 and 15) and their cousins (13 and 16) took a two hour lesson from Conner and Todd.  Three of the teens were still beginners, having had only a couple lessons in the past.  They spent 30-40 minutes getting gear and then walking through the surf steps on the beach before getting in the water.  They had a blast - all managed to ride some waves, being pushed into wave by the instructor.  Were having so much fun they asked to stay for an extra hour (which we did).  More experienced teen rode waves with Conner for a couple hours and got good tips on how to improve and read the break.  Great communication with Martin (on site leader) and Marjan (phone & email ahead of time).  Easy location to find, tons of gear to use.  In fact, kids were able to try different boards, to see which ones were easier based on their size and balance.  Would highly recommend!  Maholo!< /text>

My friend and I did a lesson together with Tyler. It was so much fun! Tyler was totally professional and made safety and fun a priority. He was always encouraging and knew exactly which waves would suit us best. All safety protocols were in place and we were instructed in them very well. There was good communication. I received an email confirmation, a text confirmation, and text reminder. Overall, a fantastic experience and well worth the price.<//Review>

I still can't believe I was able to ride multiple waves and stand on my board all the way to shore thanks to Tyler's instruction. Make sure to book photography with Marjan, as she did a great job and took amazing shots! Everything went smoothly from booking the lesson to surfing day and receiving all the great surf photos on the same day. Can't wait to book my next lesson with Kapowui<//Review>< pics>

Received a surf lesson as a birthday gift from my husband during our trip to California and it was awesome! It was our first time trying surfing ever and Edwardo (our instructor) made the experience fun and his instruction was on point! We were catching waves as soon as we got into the water! Highly recommend Kapowui Surfing School! We’ll definitely get coming back on our next visit!</review>

They spent the first half hour teaching you the technique which really helped get me comfortable. I ended up having so much fun and left with a great sense of accomplishment.

Awesome experience surfing in Santa Monica. The crew was very professional as friendly from the time we got to the Kapowui Surf Van and evening after our lesson was done. Conner was an amazing instructor. Helped our group of four catch a ton of waves. Recommend the two hour session, can’t go wrong! Will definitely be back soon.</text>

<Review>I cannot say how great of an experience I had! I have never been to California before, much less been surfing! I had Eduardo as my instructor, and he couldn’t have been more helpful, encouraging, or hilarious! I love that the lessons are very personable (we only had two people in my group), so everyone got the right amount of attention. 30 minutes into the lesson I was standing up surfing! I even started to try more advanced movements. I would highly recommend this company for anyone interested, whether experienced or not!< /Review>< Pictures>

I had an amazing session with Edwardo as my first ever surfing lesson. He was patient and skillful, watching for the appropriate wave for me to try standing on. I was standing on the board for the majority of the lesson, which was a lot of fun. He was very amenable to my ambtiousness to try different depth of water, and knew how to read the waves. I highly recommend Edwardo as he has had over 30+ years of experience and was very easy for me to get along!<//review>

< Review>
Had a lesson here. Immediately realized I need to buy the 3 pack.
They had me on the board on the very first lesson. This is my second time and I have already progressed to the pop up.
Corey is the man. He is intense in the best possible way. Shout out to you my man!</Review>

I had my first lesson with Hayley, and I couldn’t have asked for a more supportive, understanding, and knowledgeable instructor!!!! I was definitely scared, but she worked with my comfort level, while pushing and empowering me at the same time. This one lesson alone with her has given me confidence that I can achieve my dreams of surfing. She took the time to get to know me and formulated a personalized plan suited to my needs and goals. I am definitely taking more lessons with her, and know that with her help, I will achieve my goals.<//text>

Fantastic company and wonderful experience. Ruben was the man. Wife and I had a private lesson with him and he was kind, entertaining, and a patient instructor. His instructions were so good that we both were standing on the second attempt after never surfing before!

Highly recommend Kapowui for anyone!<//review>

<review>I could not say anything but the best about how amazing and professional their lessons are. I had Alex as an instructor, and not only did he give me constructive feedback, but he also went above and beyond to make sure I felt comfortable and at peace in the water, and I was up and riding within a couple waves! I will be back next time I’m in SoCal for more advanced lessons.. hopefully I can go shred with all the peeps at Kapowui when I’m good enough, lol!  Highlight of my vacation.< /review>< pictures>

I’ve never surfed before and Conner taught me and my wife everything extremely fast and easy. He was very patient and at the same time enthusiastic.  They have lessons for any level of surfers, from beginners like me, to more advanced. I strongly recommend them.</text>

Amazing place to learn how to surf for beginners and intermediate surfers! I got Tyler as my instructor and he was awesome! He is a true Californian surfer like from the movie. He knows his stuff and can teach anybody. The location is perfect to learn and improve your skills as there are small and large waves. Don’t look further. Start surfing here!!!< /review>

I took my 7-yr old daughter out with Kapowui and was very happy with our experience. Our instructor Mark was a great teacher, he offered me feedback throughout; and when my daughter struggled to stand, he kept her safely out on her board in the waves as she laid down enjoying the ocean, while pushing me to learn more. As we left, I met the owner Martin and felt very confident in how seriously he takes his work, understanding the value of the money we pay and wanting to make sure everyone has a quality experience. Mark was awesome, our photographer was there to catch every moment, and it was a pleasure to meet all of you! You guys are great and we'll see you again soon. xoxo< /Text>

We had a perfect overall experience with Kapowui for our 2 person lesson this weekend. The directions for arrival were clear and when we arrived at 6:20 they were already there, ready to go, so we got started right away. I’m a total first timer and our instructor Liam was fantastic. His instruction on the beach was interesting and helpful, and then once we got in the water he was like a surf instructor guardian angel 😂 The waves were a bit rough and coming in really quickly after each other so getting out through them was challenging, but Liam basically pushed us through them when we needed it to help us get to where the waves were breaking and make sure we didnt get too exhausted to have fun. And we did have so much fun. He pushed us off into good waves and told us when to pop up, then later helped us figure out what to do differently if we had fallen the last time. The amount of work your instructor does out in the water for you is insane so trust me this is not overpriced. (Don’t forget to tip!) Definitely want to go again.< /review>

<review>We booked surf lessons with Kapowui and from the very start they made sure we were accommodated and happy. I had a pretty large party including some kiddos. Every single instructor and the owner made sure we were taken care of. They were friendly and relatable. And made sure EVERYONE was looked after. They were knowledgeable and encouraging. I recommend them for all skill sets. They even made some of our party who couldn’t swim feel comfortable which resulted in them catching a wave. The owner is the nicest man. He was honest and caring. You can tell he really is in it for the passion & not just money. If you’re in LA I definitely recommend Kapowui.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

What an Awesome experience!!! My boyfriend and I went to Cali on our anniversary trip a few days ago and he had a blast with the surf lessons. He was able to knock "learn to surf" off his bucket list. The instructors are great. You definitely can tell they eat, breathe  and sleep surfing. They also had a wonderful photographer, Marjan. She definitely captured some amazing moments. Thanks to the whole team for the ENERGY!!!!! To more success!</Review>

<text>Eduardo is such an amazing instructor !! He was really professional, chill , and also made us feel very comfortable. He was patient enough explain to us step by step on how get on the board, and went back and forth to push us to get on the wave. We had a great time with Kapowui. This is the place to go if you wanna get the authentic California surfing experience. It’s right by the Venice beach and look for the cute orange Van with surf boards on it 🏖🚌</text><user>113145425244898288987</user>< time>

Everyobe at Kapowui is amazing. Martin has an amazing, positive staff. They are all supportive and helpful. I learned how to surf with them and have been at if for 3 years now. They introduced me to other girls also learning at the time, so we had a fun summer surf group. Its always a good time with Kapowui!<//text>

Corey was so amazing! He really encourages people to try their best and just have fun! If you’re a beginner to an advanced surfer Corey is the person to go out into the ocean with. Very trustworthy and makes you feel totally safe in the water.

Thanks for the super fun day Corey! You rock!<//review>

<Text>Kapowui Surf Lessons is a hidden gem. I received lessons from a wonderful instructor named HAYLEY (who I would highly recommend), a very durable surf board, a lightweight wet suit and was pleased with my service. I had a blast and taught quality surfing lessons. Hayley was so pleasant, enthusiastic, positive, intelligent, informative. I really enjoyed her company and her lesson. She is a delight. I recommend this place. You can’t beat it.</Text>< Pictures>

I wanted to try something new so I decided to try surfing. Mark was a great instructor and really helped me with my form and guided me the entire time out in the ocean. I was very nervous but he instilled a lot of confidence in me and I was able to ride some waves in a 1.5 hour lesson. It was an exhilarating feeling. Thank you for the awesome lesson!</Review>

I took a lesson here last week and had a really fun time!
I'm a total beginner and Corey was super knowledgeable, patient and friendly 🙂 I felt totally comfortable and was able to stand up and catch a few waves. 🌊🏄🏻‍♀️ I’ll definitely be back for more lessons! 🤙🏼<//Review>

It was an amazing experience. I booked two sessions with Diana and Haylee and both of them knew exactly how to teach a beginner like me. They made sure I got the technique and posture right before I rode those waves. I would totally recommend these guys for beginners. Thanks a ton guys! Look forward to surfing with you again!< /Text>

<Review>I took an early am lesson with Hailee and I had the best time! She was so professional, fun, and relatable. I surfed intermittently a decade ago but was never very good. After my 90 minute lesson, I was able to pop up and ride a wave on my own again. I had a blast! I could not recommend a better company to take a lesson with! Book with Kapowui; you won’t regret it!< /Review>< Pictures>

I signed up for an individual 1.5 hour lesson and indicated that I was open to having more people added to my group. Another student was added who paid for 2 hours, so the instructors let me have an extra half hour for the price of 1.5. I was also lucky to have two instructors (Mark and Luke, who were both clearly qualified and enthusiastic surfers and teachers). There was a lot of focus on appropriate technique during the land and water portions of the lesson. Even after successfully catching multiple waves, I received a lots of feedback on how to improve my stance and control. After the lesson, I was able to purchase my (used) wetsuit for a really affordable price. I'll definitely be a regular!</Text>< Rating>

Awesome private beginner lesson for our family of 5 adults. Todd was such a great instructor. Marjon made the booking really easy. Super friendly staff! Todd went through all the steps easily, and we all stood up throughout the lesson. Would definitely go with Kapowui again! Thanks guys!< /review>

Easy to book online and excellent directions to find the van and team, even when we were coming up an hour away from Long Beach. We had Corey for our first lesson ever and even though he teaches advances surfers as well, he was super professional and patient (even with me who couldn’t click from position 2 to 3 smoothly at first)! Definitely recommended for a beginner lesson; the guys who teach are super friendly, Mar handles the communication/ management/payment with ease, and they have things locked in for a great time!! Would definitley book again next time we’re here!

<rating>5<//rating><text>What an amazing place!! Had so much fun with Ryan, who was really patient with us, I even managed to catch a couple of waves by the end of the lesson! Would 100% recommend to anyone who is thinking of trying it - surfing is quite challenging but it is so rewarding. We even saw a pod of dolphins while we were out practicing!

Sorry it took so long to leave you guys a review - will definitely be back! Going to start practicing more here in the UK for sure :)< /text>< Pics>

Great surfing lessons from Corey Biggs! He’s got so much experience and he pours it into you during your lessons. Your gonna learn how to read the ocean, catch your wave, and ride them out. It’s a rad time!!

Everyone at Kapowui is great! Awesome experience!</Text>

<review>Amazing surf lesson! Conner was patient, encouraging, and really helpful correcting my moves after every ride. I’m a beginner but have taken classes in LA and Costa Rica and Conner is one of the best I’ve had. He really offers specific feedback to make sure you can catch waves on your own. Highly recommend!</review><rate>5</rate><gmap_id>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9< /gmap_id><UserId.>104885129661852489527<//UserId.><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

I had the time of my life getting back on a board today! It had been about 5 years and I had the sudden impulse to try my hand again. The board selection here is great (and beautiful colors, too; mine was turquoise) and if you’re short on time, you can rent for only an hour. This is what I tried to do, but as soon as I was in the water I knew I was calling into work. I was hooked. Definitely give this charming rental company in Santa Monica a try if you’re there! Look for the yellow van and see if Hailee is available to help you with your questions as she was super nice, very knowledgeable, and definitely helped me have a fun morning (which of course turned into a fun afternoon) at the beach!< /Review>

Todd was such a great teacher! I learned so much and was able to catch many waves on just my second session! Everyone at Kapowui is so sweet and is extremely welcoming and helpful. Definitely coming back for more sessions.</Review>

Just came out of my first lesson with Kapowui and Liam and it was great. He was thorough with his instructions, helpful on the waves and overall really great. Got the basics and extra on what I needed to ride and feel great. I wouldnt go with any other person or business. 🏄‍♀️<//Review>

<Review>Booked a two-hour surfing class as my spouse’s surprise birthday gift! He has so much fun learning to surf for the first time. He said his instructor was so patient with him. Also despite my spouse being late for twenty minutes, his instructor kindly extended the lesson so he still got nearly two hours of pure fun. This business got all five-star reviews for a good reason: you are incredible!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

These guys and girls are the real deal.  From their laid back, friendly and encouraging vibe.  To their super cool "Surf Van" office.  Its the consummate Venice Beach experience.  You'll have a blast and feel like part of the family.  Highly recommend.< /Text>

Eduardo was such a great instructor!! This was my first time in the ocean and he made me feel comfortable the entire time! I was able to stand on the board multiple times during the first class and I believe it’s because he taught us great timing. Marjan was the sweetest and got us situated quickly in the morning. I felt welcome, had so much fun, and I’ll definitely be back for more!!!!< /Text>

<Text>Checked off an item from the bucket list today, thanks to Hailee at Kapowui! She was an amazing instructor for this surfing newbie. 😆 She taught us everything we needed to know and was incredibly patient while helping us figure out how to stand up and actually surf in the water. Ahah. Great lesson, great company, cool van! Highly recommend!!!</Text>< username>

Great lesson with Corey.

I am pretty active and had been on a board a few times so he was able to adjust the lesson to my skill level.

I struggled with keeping my eyes up and foot placement when standing up and he was able to quickly identify both and help me correct them.

By the end of the lesson, I was standing up and turning on my own for a few seconds at a time.
I will definitely be back for more coaching once I get a little more comfortable on a board.<//Review>

I would highly recommend Kapowui to everyone. I have taken surfing lessons before in Hawaii and SE Asia, but could never stand up on the surfboard. During my first lesson with Corey he guaranteed I could stand up and I did it!! During my second lesson we could already seen a statistically significant improvement :p
Everyone there is super friendly and encouraging. Going surfing has become one of the things I look forward most to during a pandemic.
Thank you <333</review>

I had a great time here at Kapowui. Liam was an excellent instructor and I caught my first wave on my second rep and rode in all the way to shore. He gave great cues and pointers for me. By the end of the lesson I was riding down the line of a few waves!!!<//Review>

Todd was an amazing instructor, he was very friendly, kind, and provided great feedback during the surf lesson. He did a great job of answering every questions I had and provided positive feedback every time I got up and rode the wave. I would highly recommend him for surf lessons and I can’t wait to go back and learn more.<//Text>

My 15 year old did her first lesson this week and it was fantastic. She did the recommended 1.5 hours and really got to know the basics of surfing. Everyone was super professional and skilled - she felt encouraged and safe. She plans on surfing every week she can this summer and we will definitely book more classes! thank you!< /Text>

I took my 14 years old daughter to our first time surfing. I was concerned about the language barrier since English is my second language. But it turned out a great experience with Tyler’s coaching. He is very patient and clearly instructional. Also he gave feedback after each surf. We can both stand up on board in the first lesson , this is surprising us. We recommend Kapowui and coach Tyler.</review>

Majeen was so kind on the phone and helped me schedule online with the instructor Haley! We arrived at the beach to find the yellow van with Martin & Haley, we got set up with boards & wet suits! Cute colors & great style! Off to the beach for the lesson, Haley was really nice and the kids loved it! They were able to get up on the board and even surf for a while after the lesson on their own. Great day at the beach! So happy we found Kapowui Surf! We will continue to surf with them! If your interested I would highly recommend them, the whole experience went smooth!</review>< Pics>

Thank you Kapowui and my trainer Corey! You guys were professional, patient, and gave me a whole lot of confidence. I rode about a countless amount of waves all the way to the sand thanks to Corey. Will definitely be back ASAP. 🤙🏻🏄🏻‍♂️ Appreciate you guys! Few more lessons til I’m a pro!<//text>

First time surfing. Had a great experience with this surf school and my instructor, Alex, was a really great guy; probably one of the best instructors I have met. I got a short introduction to the surfboard and did some practice on land, and then the party started. Managed to ride a couple of waves successfully (my balance and learning abilities are horrible, so if I can pull it off, so can you) We took a short break in the middle of the lesson to swim up close to some dolphins! This experience definitely surpassed my expectations and it was the best day I had in Los Angeles.< /text>

<Text>Surf class with the Kapowui family is truly the best thing that could ever happened during my trip in California, in June 2019. It is not only surf lessons. Surfing showed me what life is all about: never give up(and yet so much more!!!). You will fall off the plank but this feeling inside when you stand on it is worth a thousand falls. Surfing is my best life memory so far. So jump ahead and surf. Be the conqueror of your past self and embrace your inner power. With this family, they won't  let you down until you can do it!
Thank you all so much.
Love and stay awesome!</Text>< Pics>

I have been looking to try surfing for a long time now and after doing some research I decided on Kapowui! I was super happy with my lesson and my instructor Tyler was super fun, friendly, and receptive to my skill level. I learned a ton and had a lot of fun while doing it! Highly recommend to first time surfers if you are looking for a way to start your surfing adventure!<//Text>

<text>This was the best surfing experience I have ever had. The guys were cool, the waves were amazing and the boards were nice. Super excited about the experience and best part was I got on the board first try.</text>< Pics>

It was my first time ever on a board and my instructor was cool and helpful about what I need to do. By the end of my two hour lesson I was hooked. I went and got my own board and was out there next day and the owner Martin was cool enough to give me some pointers<//review>

I had an excellent experience while booking a lesson with Kapowui. They had exceptional communication skills and made me feel comfortable the entire time throughout my visit! I am very satisfied and will definitely come back!< /text>

Ruben was a fantastic instructor. We surfed for two hours and had a blast. Instructions were clear and lessons made sense. Spent about 30 min on the beach and an hour and a half in the water catching waves. I had never surfed before and by the end I was comfortable out on the water on my own.<//text>

I am a 54 year old female who had never surfed before, but Todd B was an excellent and patient instructor, and Kapowui! I got up the first attempt and had an awesome ride! I was able to ride waves most of the 2 hour lesson - exhilarating, challenging and addicting.

I’ll be back! <3</text>

<review>The moment I arrived I felt comfortable and accepted. My instructor Lucas worked with me every step of the way and gave me wonderful feed back as I began my surfing experience. He kept me safe, as the current was very strong at the time and provided me with the knowledge to keep myself safe before entering the ocean. We luaghed allot and the entire lesson was wonderful. I can't wait to go back and try again.</review>< Resp>

I’ve gone here multiple times for lessons and had a blast both times! The instructors know what they’re doing. They give you feedback so you can get better with each wave you catch. If I take more lessons, it will be through Kapowui. If I don’t, it’s cuz I got my own board and am doing it on my own 😊</text>

Ruben was everything I wanted out of a surf instructor! He was a perfect match for me, he's thoughtful and insightful, and keeps an even keel; really knows his stuff! We had a great experience with Kapowui, and recommend lessons with their team, esp. Ruben! Go early and get parking right on the beach, and start your lessons before the crowds start to amass.<//Text>

My boyfriend and I were just going to visit Venice Beach when we saw Kapowui surfing and decided to give it a try. Initially, I was very hesitant since I do not know how to swim, but I was encouraged to try it out. I was able to catch and ride some waves as soon as we hit the water. Our experience was excellent and I highly recommended this to anyone who comes across the Kapowui surf team.<//Review>

We chose Will as our instructor and he was so chill & a great teacher. Very patient and great at helping us learn safely. We both actually managed to stand up on and ride some waves - and it was our first time ever surfing! Incredible value, too, $200 for 90 minutes of (private) surfing lessons for 2 people and you get all the gear included in that. Make this happen - you won't regret it!</Text>< pics>

Great waves, great weather and an AWESOME instructor. Ed did a great job teaching is the basics and helped us to catch waves all on our own, at our own pace. Thanks Kapowui, I’ll be back next time I’m in Cali.<//text>

Highly recommend taking a lesson here ! I had a 2 hour session early Sunday morning with Alex. He was a great instructor and also just a cool dude. It was my first time surfing but he got me up surfing right away, and by the end of the session he was catching waves along side me! 10/10 would recommend.< /Text>

We called Kapowui surf club and Martin was our instructor and he was absolutely AMAZING!!! He taught us sooooo much about surfing and we actually rode several waves.

He was the surfing god and he looked like him too (wink wink) loljj.<//Text>< pics>

<Time>1500062580840<//Time><Rate>5</Rate><Text>I can not heap enough praise on Kapowui at Venice for the absolute best people to teach you to surf. We presented them with a challenge, teach our two Autistic children to surf, and they went over & above anything we could have hoped for. Karla was selected as their Instructor because of her qualifications, skill & experience with children with special needs. She had my children in the water, after teaching them all the safety skills they needed and they were standing on their boards in no time. The had so much fun because Karla's way of teaching has having fun as it's core principle. Not for one second did I have any worry about the children's safety because Karla was right there, beside them every single step of the way.  Kapowui is more than a company that teaches you to surf, it is a family in every sense and you feel that immediately. Karla you gave Jordan & Hayley the best thing anyone could give them, you gave them a love of surfing. Myself and the two newest members of Kapowui Surf Family can't thank you enough. We will see you next year.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHZX2fGQa6xJFECoOiyzo3p8LpjSDlNZGyCpRK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHdpM2AAVQQ0knnm_UfKyo-kQH2qe76Rj4Nq_8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9</gmapID></record>

<review>I had my surf lesson today with Eduardo / Ed and he was AMAZING!! Eduardo taught me step-by-step the best way to get up on the board and catered what I struggled with previously to ensure I got up properly. Eduardo was attentive, supportive and very encouraging! I had an awesome time surfing -Eduardo said he’d get me on the board for 10 waves and I ended up surfing on more than 20 from Eduardo’s helpful tips and guidance. 100% recommend and ask for Eduardo!</review><Response>None<//Response>< user_id>

Connor did an amazing job making sure we were comfortable with the board and with the water. Effectively taught us how to get on the board and off as well as navigate the waves and water. Would highly recommend booking with Connor for your first lesson.< /Review>

Started and ended my lessons at Kapowui so stoked! Even after one lesson with Conner I was riding waves. After two more lessons I am surprised at how far I’ve come. I highly recommend this surf school if you’re looking for the perfect blend of professionalism and fun.<//text>

<Review>I had a great experience learning how to surf with Madeline at Kapowui Surf Lessons. I had never surfed before so I was a little nervous going into it but by the end I was hooked and can’t wait to try it again. We started with a lesson on the sand to learn the four steps to getting into the surf position. We repeated it a number of times and received feedback from Madeline about how to improve. She made sure the three of us in the lesson had a good understanding and were able to perform the moves before we went into the water. In the water she would help us catch the wave and indicate when we needed to stand up. This was helpful so we could focus on applying the techniques that we learned on the sand. Again Madeline provided feedback after each time and was very easy going making it a more enjoyable experience. We had a blast and I look forward to the next lesson.</Review>< UserId.>

I must say that I rarely post reviews but my experience with Kapowui has been nothing short of excellent. They are a pleasure to work with from booking thru the end of class. Everyone involved is lovely, knowledgeable and friendly. It can be a bit intimidating to be a true beginner but not so with their wonderful team. You will have a wonderful time.<//Review>

My sister (14 yo) and I (17 yo) booked a lesson package with Hayle and the first one was already awesome! She was so patient and supportive through out. And her knowledge of all things surf is evident. It was so enjoyable and fun to be around her and she made us super comfortable getting started. Martin, the surfer chief, and the other staff too were also super friendly, enjoyable, and knowledgeable. I definitely recommend booking and I can’t wait for my next lesson!!! Go Kapowi!!< /text>

<Text>I chose Kapowui for my first surfing lessons (2 h + 1 h lesson) and I can highly recommend Kapowui Surf Club. They are all easy going, very friendly, the communication is very good and the instructions by Todd were perfect ;), so good that I managed to stand up on the board and was able to "surf" several times during my first surf lesson despite very bad and challenging conditions. Gern wieder ;) Thank you! See you at the beach! :)

I met with these guys this morning in Santa Monica. Very professional, knowledgeable, and patient. By the end of my surf lesson, I was was able to pop up on my board and surf--albeit for 20 seconds. But I learned a lot and will take another lesson. You guys are awesome!!!

Best surf lessons, by far!  I've used Kapowui each time I'm in Venice for annual conferences.  Always a good time.  They are very experienced, easy to work with no matter your skill level, always professional and accommodating no matter what.  Can't say enough about Martin and his people.  Can't wait to take my daughters with me next time!</review>

The entire experience was exceptional from start to finish. Ryan, our instructor was knowledgeable, helpful and very professional during the lesson. His personality and patient demeanor suited us perfectly. We are looking forward to another visit and lesson in the future. Quality service and experience.</Review>

Sick lesson.
Was up instantly crushing waves with ease.
Felt like a pro!
It came super easy due to Hailey knowing her stuff.

Definitely do this!< /Review>

<text>Blake was an excellent surf instructor! He was so nice and so patient because he was making sure me and my friend were learning on our own pace. He was also extremely fun and welcoming. We both enjoyed our selves so much and it was because of Blake. He encouraged me and taught me so well that I was able to catch a few waves and this was the very first day I’ve ever surfed!!!</text>< gmap_id>

Took a 2 hour lesson with Alex, and haven’t had that much fun in years. Alex was extremely professional, showing me the in’s and out’s before heading out to the ocean. I was able to pick it up rather quickly, and he adapted his teaching to my progression. I will definitely be coming back!!</text>

<review>TL;DR: Kapowui is the real deal! Ultimate value for money, personalized instructions, surfing at a no-crowd part of the beach, and detailed feedback at every step, resulting in quick progress and a great experience.

The Details:

A little bit of background before I go into the details of my experience with Kapowui. As of the date of posting this review, I had been surfing for 3-4 months but was never able to fully ride a green wave (face of an unbroken wave). I had taken a couple of lessons at another surfing school, but my experience was far from satisfactory. Neither did I get the private lessons I had been promised, nor did I get detailed feedback. I decided to try out Kapowui after looking at reviews, and I wish I had started out with Kapowui in the first place.

Martin, the owner, was extremely friendly and asked me to try out a class first and then decide if I wanted to sign up for a package deal. My first class was with Gregory (Greg) aka G-Force. He is a highly experienced surfer  and an exceptional instructor (15+ years experience teaching). He corrected some bad practices I had picked up, and had me surfing green waves within 30 minutes!

After that experience, I decided to sign up for 5 classes at once, and took another class with Greg. I felt like I had taken some big strides in terms of my surfing ability, and was able to catch green waves more consistently.

Another big plus is that Kapowui is located near a beach that is near-secluded in the off-season, so you don't have to worry about being hit by oncoming surfers. It's a lot more relaxing when you focus on the surfing part, which is difficult as it is.

If you are looking for that one-off experience as a tourist, or looking to crank your skills up a notch, Kapowui is the place you want to be.</review>< user>

Very professional approach.  Great website. They park their cool 60s Volkswagon van at the parking entrance as a nice visual intro (can't miss them).  They supply the boards and wetsuits, a discount for multiple people, but most importantly excellent instruction.  Blake taught my two daughters land drills for the prone position, a lunge move to get upright, and balance tips.  He offered great descriptive and prescriptive feedback when either daughter needed adjustments and encouragement.  This takes about 1/2 hour, so I suggest signing up for the 1.5 hour session to give you a full hour in the water.  He promised both girls would succeed in getting up and riding some waves.  He was right. One daughter caught on and had multiple successes.  He continued working hard with the other daughter until she got up and rode a solid wave all the way in. Blake showed patience throughout with a pleasant demeanor and comforting approach. I would suggest him, but I am sure Martin would only hire excellent instructors so you will do well with whoever instructs you.  Thanks Blake and Martin.

Our surf lesson was our FIRST and it was INCREDIBLE!  100% it was the highlight of our trip and an unforgettable experience.  Our instructor was kind, encouraging and made sure we felt safe at all times.  The weather wasn't great that day but it didn't change how much fun we had.  We cannot wait to be there again!</Review>

<review>Me and my husband took a class from Madeline and she is the best! We had so much fun and learned so much in a short amount of time. We lucked out with amazing weather and beautiful waves. This company is owned by a family and they really care about your experience. Madeline is a thoughtful instructor and really watches the conditions to give you the best experience. Will definitely be back every time we are in LA.<//review>< pics>

Marty is the BEST! We’re out here from Chicago and just went surfing for the first time.
Caught a bunch of waves, sunshine, and most importantly laughs.

< Review>
Had a lesson yesterday with Colston and I’m super stoked about the experience. Never surfed before and the guy was really patient and was very thorough. We were both determined to get me standing up on the board and I’m pumped that it actually happened. I definitely recommend this experience to anyone who has never surfed before. It was epic! Thanks again!!</Review>

<text>Had an awesome one-on-one lesson with Ryan! It was my first time ever trying to surf and was able to get up on at least 10 waves on my first lesson. Gear, level of instruction and location were all perfect. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Santa Monica.< /text>< resp>

The technique they described was easy to follow. By the end of the day we were catching waves, despite it being a day of intense swells. Felt very confident out in the water alongside Colston our top notch instructor. Would definitely recommend, a fantastic first surf lesson experience.</review>< Name>

<name>Trey Lohman< /name><Review>Very good place to get a lesson! They have a cool team working there and are very helpful with any questions, surf or non-surf related. I started with little surfing experience. Ive wake surfed before but this was a lot different. I was able to get up on the board and ride a few waves into shore by the end of the lesson. That was the same for the other two individual that took the class, except neither of them had any type of surf experience. They are affordable and actually offer cheaper options if you do a group lessons. The Kapowui team definitely set me up for surfing success! 🤙🏻Lastly, I want to mention that i was able to take my skills gained from this experience and rent a board in Santa Cruz, WITHOUT the need of another lesson, and had loads of fun!<//Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< Time>

<Text>Took a lesson with Todd for 2 hours and he was hyper detailed, attentive and patient. He checked in whether I had questions and how I was feeling throughout our session. And even at the end when I thought I was out of gas, he got me to do one more wave. The best experience!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9</GmapID></record>

<review>These guys are amazing. Our instructor was Juan, he was relentlessly energetic, friendly and fun the entire time. We were all into it so much that we went over our appointment time by quite a while without even noticing. The instruction was great, he taught right to our beginner level and we left the lesson feeling like we'd learned a lot; we both managed to ride an entire wave within the first 10 minutes in the water.

While there we also met the owner, Martin who was super friendly and welcoming. The same goes for the other teachers we met while hanging out. Great group of folks all around, we couldn't recommend Kapowui high enough.< /review>< Time>

Amazing experience! Had taken a couple lessons elsewhere before but never really had the confidence to go out on my own.  Todd is a great teacher, got us both ready to catch big waves (4-6ft) within two hours.  Stoked to get back out there and try again!< /text>

<review>My boys took surf lessons with Blanke on December 26, 2019. It was my oldest son‘s birthday and he wanted to try surfing. His younger brother tagged along for fun.   They had such a great time! Blake was easy going, and he’s a great instructor. He really motivated the boys to get the most out of the two hour session. We are happy to say that both boys were able to get up on their boards and surf. When we come back to LA, we will certainly look up the Kapowui brothers again for surf lessons! Next time the whole family will try it.  Aloha!< /review>< user>

Best time ever! If this 47-year can catch some waves at the end of her Excellent, Fun, Challenging lesson ... anyone can!! I'm HOOKED! Seriously, a great, knowledgeable, safe learning environment. Dylan was a spectacular, gently-firm (does that make sense?!) instructor who really, really wanted me to succeed, and I did! Thanks to him! I highly recommend this surf school. Thank you all for the encouragement and positivity!</Review>

I had a 2 hour lesson with Madeline and loved it! I'm an absolute beginner and she made the entire experience fun and enjoyable. By the end of the lesson I was catching (most) of my waves and improving every try. She was very attentive and a fantastic teacher.< /Review>

My siblings were visiting LA and I brought them to Kapowui and it was an incredible time!  Gregory (G-Force) is an incredible instructor; he got us in the surfing spirit and made for a great experience!  A couple dolphins even swam by.  Cannot recommend this place enough!

We had a great time! Will was an awesome instructor. I’d recommend Kapowui to anyone who is looking to learn to surf!<//Text>

This is coming from someone who before never even stood on a surfboard let alone ride one. I come from the landlocked state of Colorado and after only 2 lessons I was able to stand up and ride a wave. What a rush! Martin's teaching style is great he's patient and tailors his teaching methods to fit the clients abilities and meddle. I definitely recommend.< /text>

I was a first time surfer from the east coast looking for a lesson while visiting LA for work. Gregory was an awesome instructor and incredibly patient. He spent time walking thorough each step in the process and was encouraging even when I kept getting smashed by waves. Highly recommend Kapowui for a first time surfer!</Review>

First time surfing for me and my wife, and we could not have chosen a better crew to do it with! Madeline was such an awesome instructor - super thoughtful, caring and made sure we learned all the fundamentals. We caught a bunch of waves with her and my wife had a blast. We’re total converts. Marty and the dog are super chill. We are so happy we chose Kapowui!!<//text>

<review>First time surfing and it was freaking amazing! These guys were amazing! Very professional, very detailed and in depth instructions before you even hit the water. Once your out there they don't give you more than you can handle, Dylan was our instructor and he was the best. Felt super comfortable with him. Definitely recommend 10/10. I'm going to come back any time I'm in town</review>< pictures>

If you've always wanted to try out surfing, you should definitely try out Kapowui. The staff there is very laid back and they really take care of their customers. Nothing but good vibes all around. Todd was an excellent surf instructor. Today was my first time surfing and I was able to stand on the board. Just listen carefully to his instructions and you'll be fine. 10/10!< /review>

Me and my friend spent the best time ever with Kapowui. We’re glad that we bought lesson with them. We had a lesson with Will, and we totally recommend him as your future  instructor, I bet all of them are great. Will was patient and understanding, he taught us a lots of things about surfing. We were tired after those lessons, but it was definitely worth it. If you want to have a great experience like us, you should buy lessons with Kapowui, and don’t think about it. You won’t be disappointed. We’ll come back to them in the future for sure.<//text>

I had the opportunity to go on the water with Blake D.  Learning with him has given me tremendous clarity and confidence on what to do in the water and I can consistently catch waves now!!  Thank you Blake!  Will definitely be back for more.</text>

I highly recommend.  He really helps you to learn the basics on land to make sure you're prepared for when you head out into the water.  I tried surfing a times on my own before taking the class with him but i really had a hard time standing up on the board and being able to enjoy surfing.  With Corey's help and the new techniques he taught me I was able to stand up on a lot of the waves in the class.  I had so much fun i went and grabbed my surfboard after the class and continued surfing.  It was such a night and day difference.  I could catch most of the waves and ride them to shore!!!!  It was so much fun and i didnt want to stop.  I highly recommend Corey Biggs and the Kapowui surf school.  They will get you riding and loving the waves!!!!</review>< pics>

<review>Phenomenal all around.  First, was easy to book.  Second, it's the authentic SoCal surfing experience, starting with meeting at the funky Kapowui van in the parking lot.  Third, the lesson with Madeline was killer.  I signed my 15 year old daughter up, who has had lessons in the past with only male instructors.  This was great.  As good as Madeline's surfing and teaching abilities were, she's even a better human being.  Highly recommend.</review>< user_id>

We had an absolute blast! Totally, recommend Kapowui if you want to do surfing in Venice Beach they're fantastic! Knowledgeable, friendly, patient, and super helpful. Will is an absolute beast and put on his own little show at the end of our lesson. Will was patient and helpful with every individual in our group, such an awesome company for any level of surfing. Thanks guys for an incredible experience!</Review>

We were amazingly satisifed with Kapowui!! Todd was our instructor and he soooo much fun and patient and literally held our boards 😊 to get us going!
The entire Kapowui family was friendly and has so much aloha spirit 🤙🏾🏝

<text>A must visit team. It was so easy and pleasant to schedule classes when we called Martin. He scheduled us for the following day with Carl who is an amazing instructor. He is friendly, reassuring and has a great energy through out the entire class. He spent carefully explaining the safely measures and the basics outside the water and then we spent an hour with him in the water guiding us with each wave. We are going back again for two more conservative days of lessons with Carl (from South Africa 🇿🇦)
Of course the sunny LA sky in mid July at 9am class, gentle 3’ Waves and a surprise visit from school of dolphins that gracefully paid us a visit in the middle of ocean added to the thrill of beginners luck. Thank you Kapowui for being here today and giving us such remarkable experience. 😎🏄🏻🏄🏻🏄‍♀️🐬< /text>< user>

Definitely go with Kapowui!  My instructor, Ruben,   Was super knowledgeable, personable and very conscientious to go at a pace that suited me.  He gave me great insight on things to tweak between each wave and I was definitely standing up by the end of my lesson!   Entirely free of charge he provided charmingly casual conversation while waiting for the perfect wave. ;)<//Text>

I had Todd tutor me for 2 hours. Great tuition. He had me consistently catching waves and standing on the board by the end of the session, which is amazing considering I’m new to this. Highly recommend, thoroughly enjoyed< /text>

Surfing class at Kapowui is the perfect mix between our Beach-Boys based, bleached-blonde fantasy of California surfing and the actual, real, raw athletic effort that any sport requires.
In my first class with lovely Haylee we began with learning on the sand the basic four technical steps that take any surfer (including Patrick Swayze in Point Break) from flat belly down on the board to up on your feet riding the hurricane of your life.
But no, once in the water, I rode no hurricanes and I definitely did not look—neither feel—like the female version of Swayze. Well, the pink-shaded waves of this sunny yet impalpable California dawn did feel like hurricanes to my inexperience, though, especially each time I fell off the board even before hitting step four, the one that actually places your feet on the board, your upper body all the way up and your eyes into your freedom (the moment when the fun is supposed to begin, basically).
One time (maybe three, but two of them count only as a rehearsal), with the assistance and the direction of Haylee, for a few seconds that felt like a serendipitous eternity, I was actually able to catch, feel and maintain my balance and ride my personal Friday morning's hurricane (probably the most peaceful wave ever in the history of the entire Pacific Ocean). And, that really felt like an accomplishment! Another accomplishment was when I started understanding what I was doing wrong, like when I was leaning too much forward (and therefore falling into the water even before standing up on the board) or when I was trying to get up and catch the wave too soon or too late (and, by doing that, I was completely missing the momentum and the physical and spiritual connection with the wave).
But, above all, it's the intimacy with the ocean, that I enjoyed the most. Since I took a semi-private class, while Haylee was working with the other student, I had long moments on my own. As I had just been taught to always place my board's nose (yeah, that's how they call it) toward the horizon (Haylee was pretty clear about the surfer's etiquette in the water!), I could breath in the mysterious dissolution of that blue far end-line while receiving the gift of the most magical dance choreographed by a family of silver fishes (I swear I never saw one single fish in the ocean, before) and admiring the million dollar flight of the immeasurably powerful yet gracefully humble seagulls.
Indeed a blessed experience, this first surf lesson, thanks to the professionalism of the Kapowui's team and my teacher Haylee's training tips and health-safety supervision.
Heading back home to get the sand off my feet, now. Listening to a Beach Boys' song, of course!</Review>

I highly recommend Kapowui to anyone who wants to take surf lessons in the LA area.
I live in LA and have tried a few other surf lesson providers in the area.  I've also gone surfing a few times with local guides on tropical vacations.  The quality of instruction and positive vibes at Kapowui far exceeds the local competition.  I find myself enjoying the lessons with Kapowui at Venice just as much as I have enjoyed my surf sessions in the tropics (and they don't have the help of 80 degree water and gently peeling reef breaks).
So far I have taken 15+ lessons with Kapowui.  I can feel progress after each session.  All of the instructors give sound advice and quality tips while also maintaining a fun atmosphere.  Recently I've had more sessions with Carl, and he's really helped me improve a lot.  I also recommend Todd and Ryan.
In summary, go surfing with Kapowui! It'll be fun!< /Text>

Will was our instructor, and we could not have asked for more! He was enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and incredibly patient with our group. You can tell this guy loves his job, and it definitely helps to make the experience memorable. None of us had ever surfed before, and all six members of our group got up on our boards multiple times because of his direction and patience. Definitely worth every dollar!<//review>

Carl the instructor was fantastic with our group of 3.  Waves were great for beginners at this location, with a few very large sets.  We were glad to have an expert watching out for us who could see the scale of waves coming from a distance.  I highly recommend bringing an expert out with you for your first several times/days going out, their expertise is invaluable.  We all had some success and also some fantastic wipeouts.  Thanks Carl!<//review>

My Dad and I are from England and Texas respectively so do not have any surf experience at all but decided while were in LA to try it out. What an amazing experience! Carl was a great teacher and explained things in a way that we would understand. They guaranteed to get you standing up on the board and they duly delivered!

I cannot recommend this enough if you are staying in the area - a great team of guys and a great experience!

Cheers!

<text>Highly recommend going here! I was nervous going by myself, but the guys were all really nice. I was talking to them for awhile and they are all really helpful and knowledgeable. After just an hour and a half I felt really comfortable on the surf board and it was totally worth it. Definitely will take another lesson when I'm in the area next time.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

This was the first time I have ever been surfing. I came with zero surfing experience but left totally hooked. Travis was a great instructor. He cheered me on and explained many helpful tips. The wave where huge but he always insured that I stayed save. Thanks to him I managed to ride my first couple of waves. The Kapowui crew is amazing. I'm already looking forward to my second lesson.</review>

<text>Couldn’t have had a better few lessons. My instructor Will made me feel comfortable and improved my skills from previous experience surfing. I really got the most out of the lesson and after each wave I was shown how to improve to become a better surfer. Thanks so much! Will definitely be back when I’m next in LA< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< username>

< Review>
Kapowui surf school is the best! I have never gone surfing before and I couldn’t have picked a better company to learn from! While scheduling our lesson online my friend mentioned we were absolute beginners and we got matched up for a lesson with Harry. First, Harry made sure we were all comfortable during the land portion. He expertly explained the different components of the board and gave us a quick class on ocean conditions. Next during the practical portion he encouraged us and gave us feedback on our form after every wave we rode. I felt safe having him as a teacher and under his instruction my friends and I all managed to get up on board by ourselves! It was a truly incredible experience and I now feel like I have the knowledge to go out and try surfing by myself. I will definitely be renting my equipment from the Kapowui school in the future! Highly recommend this place!< /Review>

Blake was amazing for my first lesson, and a refresher lesson for my husband this morning!

He made sure we knew the fundamentals before getting out on the water, and never left my side!

The board and wetsuit quality worked great for the area.

Would highly reccomend and will be back!</Text>

<review>I surfed for the first time this morning. It was AMAZING! It was a 1 1/2 hour session at Venice Beach with Ruben from Kapowui, and I LOVE surfing! ❤️ I will definitely be back. Ruben was SO fun and kind. He was a good teacher and was understanding when I fell. The lesson was SUPER FUN and very easy. I’m thirteen with NO experience, and I popped up at least ten times in  the 1 hour! (Thanks Ruben!) The wetsuits and boards are super high quality, and I didn’t get too cold. Kapowui is definitely the best and most fun surfing experience on the beach! 🤙🤟❤️🏄‍♀️

Had a lesson booked with Carl and it was a great experience. Very knowledgeable and patient. Whether you’re 15 or 50 they’ll figure out a way to get you surfing. 2 hours is a must for your first time so you can get a feel for it and not just rush through. Would definitely do it again.< /text>

What an awesome time at Kapowui! We had Carl as an instructor and he was great! He had so much knowledge about surfing and the sea and everything he shared and taught us helped us learn so quickly and gain the confidence we needed. Carl was patient, understanding and thoughtful and any fear of the water and surfing was gone and it became an amazing experience! Thank you so much to Kapowui and Carl. We will definitely be back to ride the waves with you again!<//Text>

<review>We had such a fun time with our instructor Will! None of us thought we’d be able to even get up on our boards, but by the end we were able to paddle and ride waves in thanks to Will’s instruction and guidance the whole time. All the staff were welcoming and enthusiastic. I would 100 percent come back to Kapowui for surf lessons.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Greg G-Force was the bastion of positive energy I needed coming into our lesson. From the breathing exercises to prepare us for the day to the specific tips to improve, I highly recommend booking with him!

So we came back...and G-Force did it again!! Not only did he remember our names and faces from last sesh but also he built on the basics he taught us in our first lesson. This time focusing on turning and speeding up/slowing down, we definitely took it to the next level. If you’re going Kapowui (which you should!) you gotta go with G-Force!<//text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Took my first ever surf lesson this morning with my 9-year old daughter and it was a blast! Team Kapowui is super nice, really cool with the kids too.
Our teacher Colson even spoke some French for my non-English speaking daughter. Very patient, easy and good teacher. We both managed to ride our first waves and stand up. Strong recommend everyone should give it a try.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I had my very first surf lesson this morning with Harry. I was a little nervous because I’m cautious about getting too far into the water and I’m definitely not the most coordinated or athletic person. Anyway, Harry was so friendly and patient with me and explained everything I needed to know to begin my journey as a surfer. I had the 2 hour session (if you’re brand new to surfing I would certainly recommend) and had plenty of time to practice, gather myself and practice some more. I made huge progress and actually ended my session with the best wave ride of the day. Looking forward to to going back again!!<//text>

Our instructor Todd was amazing.  He spent 3 hours with us (me 51 and my 3 daughters 14,12,9) in the water and got all of us up in the the 20 min.  My girls had a blast and wanted to keep going after the lesson.  They are all hooked.  Todd was patient and made the entire experience enjoyable.

Monty the owner was super supportive and friendly.  I brought my own GoPro and some how it had run out of battery and Monty was kind enough to let us use one of theirs at no charge.  Great operation all around.  👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Had an excellent 2-person lesson with Carl then came back a second day to rent equipment and practice more.  Carl, who is a competitive surfer, taught the fundamentals beach side then assisted in the surf.  Thanks to his help and instruction I was able to stand multiple times and ride some waves from break to beach.  It was a fun and exhilarating experience.   Don't expect to hang ten the first time out but what a fun sport to take on.  Surfing is like life, you try, you fall down, you succeed now and then, and you keep climbing back on for more.   Thanks Kapowui and Carl for a memorable time!!   Highly recommended.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Took a 2 hour lesson with Alex and he was awesome. My first time surfing and got up on 3 waves. Alex set me up with great instructions and keep my safety in mind all the time. The owner Martin was so chill to help me set up my lesson at the last moment. This was the first time I’d tried surfing and I’d say Kapowui was the best choice.<//text>

<review>The reviews are true, Kapowui is awesome!  The entire staff could not be nicer and more accommodating. I am a beginner and had injured my knee surfing about 4 months ago (surfing by myself) and decided it was time to learn the right way to surf. My instructor Travis was a pro, he showed me what I was doing wrong and more importantly how to safely surf (thanks Travis!). I booked a two hour session (well worth it) and by the end of it I felt like I was getting up on at least 80% of the waves.The whole experience was top notch and I would highly recommend to anyone that wants to learn how to surf.<//review>< Pics>

<text>Clay is a great instructor. He had me surfing on the first wave we hit.
Martin, the owner, is a great fella.
Very professional and experienced staff.

Perfect for beginners, especially if you can skateboard...it’s a breeze.< /text>< time>

<Review>Reuben was an awesome instructor! Ive been surfing for 8 years summer months in NY for most of my life. He asked first what my skill level was, checked my pop up stance and proceeded to throw me in water to guage what I needed work on. He was super insightful, knowledgeable and awesome on the board(he almost got pitted). He would show me his style and thought process on how he would catch a wave. I highly recommend him to anyone who's planning to try this school out that is at any skill level. You wont go wrong!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9< /Gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

The whole Kapowui team was extremely knowledgable, friendly and made everyone feel safe in the water (90% of our group were first-time surfers!). Ruben, Will & Ryan were our awesome instructors for the day and each of them took the time to make sure everyone in our group was having a great time and getting up on the board. Overall, it was really easy and fun to book with them - also, the owner, Martin is a super friendly guy with the cutest puppy! He introduced himself to our squad and we will def. book another lesson with them!!</Text>< pics>

I highly recommend Katowice surf lessons! We are visiting from New Jersey to Venice beach for a few days and our 3 kids ages 8,10 and 12 had lessons with Ryan. He was awesome! He took extra special care with my kids. They had the time of their life. Ryan made the experience for the first time surfing for my kids just awesome . Highly recommended if you want to learn to surf when in Venice beach!</Text>

Wouldn't think twice about surfing again with Kapowui!  Had an incredible experience.  Sweet amount of time on land to nail surf form and plenty of time on the water to test balance and listening skills.  Instructor was awesome- Thanks Todd!</review>

He was highly talented as well as hilarious, making sure we knew fundamentals and safety while cracking us up along the way.

This was the most fun I’ve had in a long time! It was my first time ever surfing. Colston was a fantastic instructor, very patient and really helpful with technique.  If you want to feel fully alive and experience the ocean at its finest, take a surf lesson with Kapowui. You’ll be glad you did.< /text>

Tried surfing for the first time and glad I choose Kapowui for it. Being a first timer it really helped to take private lesson with Clay who taught me the basics about the board and was always around to help me catch the waves and stand and surf ;) Absolutely loved it. Definitely recommend Kapowui and if you are a first timer have Clay as your guide 🙃</text>

<text>As a beginner surfer with no experience whatsoever, I was excited to try the sport but wasn’t sure how easy it would be to catch onto. We took a 2 hour lesson with Ruben at the Venice beach location and he had all three of us standing up and riding waves into the shore in no time. Ruben was thorough in his explanations, answered any questions that we had, and cheered us on the whole time. He was also very personable, therefore made us very comfortable with him and with getting out on the boards. You can see that he is very passionate about the sport and loves to share it with others. I would absolutely take another surf lesson with him and definitely recommend him to anyone looking to take a lesson with Kapowui!</text>< username>

I highly recommend using Kapowui Surf lessons! I had never surfed before and Madeline did a great job of breaking down the steps to getting up on a wave. I ended up catching a number of waves with Madeline's help.< /text>

My first surfing experience was amazing thanks to these guys!  Our instructor Juan was attentive, funny, engaging, and truly dedicated to making sure we knew the basics before taking us out onto the waves.  A truly gratifying adventure that I'll never forget.  The owner Marty was also very helpful and welcoming, giving me a few tips to keep in mind for my next sojourn into the waves.  Thank you so much for the spectacular time you guys!  I'll be coming back for sure!< /review>

Came from Florida for my friends wedding. Wanted to do some surfing while I was here. Found these guys and couldn’t be more happy! The waves were amazing and they did an amazing job to make sure we had a good time. The crew is awesome and the prices are so reasonable. I would totally surf with them again next time I come out here. Check em out!< /Text>

<Review>I had a 1.5 hour 8 AM lesson with Ed. He was great! We covered the various parts of a surfboard and their purpose, why exactly we were going to be surfing where we were, how to get to the surfer pose, and the safety aspects of surfing. All of this was one-on-one and done at a pace that covered everything thoroughly and left plenty of time in the water.

I felt that Ed is genuinely happy to see his students do well. He celebrated along with me when I rode my first wave! I can't recommend Kapowui highly enough!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I as an avid snowboarder, I had been wanting to try surfing for some time to see if my snow legs could convert to the waves. Sure enough, with a lesson from Carl and a perfect ocean, I was able to get up on the waves! Kapowui provided me with an AMAZING first experience! I’ll be renting a board and suit in the near future with my new found skills :)<//Text>

My sister and I had a great surfing experience with Carl. Being beginners it can be very intimidating. Carl shared his knowledge of surfing and made us feel comfortable in the ocean. We even got the chance to see some dolphins and seals. Highly recommend!<//review>

Our instructor Ryan made it an easy and fun experience for the both of us by giving us personalized tips and assistance throughout our lesson. I was a little nervous going into the lesson since I don't have much experience, but Ryan helped me to feel safe and encouraged the entire time by pushing me over the big waves and guiding me every step of the way. Overall, we had an amazing time and could not stop smiling throughout our lesson.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>This was my first time surfing, I’m from the east coast (Michigan) so I never had a chance to surf. My first time surfing was exhausting but very fun, the instructor (Todd) seemed very knowledgeable and specific. He even tweaked the lesson so it’d fit me more. All in all very cool experience, great teachers.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>We had the most incredible time with Leon as our instructor. We were first time surfers, and his instructions and patience with us was excellent. He was very friendly and got us going quickly. We both managed to ride a few good waves all the way to the beach during our two hour lesson. Don't settle for anything less than two hours; you'd be doing yourself a disservice. And make sure you're a decent swimmer! Surfing is a workout! Thanks so much Leon for your support. You made a dream of ours come true.<//Text><time>1536347181497<//time><response>{'time': 1562171583330, 'text': 'Wow Thank you Nicolas we really appreciate it'}< /response>< gmap_id>

I’ve had lessons with Thierry, Garret, Haylee, and Todd and all of them were great instructors and really nice people. Even when conditions weren’t very good they managed to salvage good surf lessons and still get me practicing and standing up. They’re also all helpful with things like reading tide, waves, etc so that I’ll be able to practice myself and be far better off than without their lessons. Always early/on time, equipment is good, highly recommend them if you’re looking for surf lessons in the LA area.<//Review>

<Response>{'time': 1595555946889, 'text': 'I\'ve written this 3 time but google keeps censoring my reply so here\'s one last attemp without saying where the virus originated, maybe this one will not be censored.\n\nNot quite sure why your panties are in a wad. Where did the virus come from? What did the media call it in the beginning? So was I wrong to call it what they did? Amazing at how people forget these things and would rather be politically correct. So when I was refunding you, I only stated a fact and referenced the name the media was calling it at the time. The Media said that chXnxx was the source of the virus so my refund message to you I put in the information that was the available to me. I should have had the foresight to call it covid long before scientist came up with the name, I guess I\'m just not that clever.  I\'m sorry me referencing the origin of the virus offended you. I hope this helps you better understand my frame of my mind.\n\nOh and BTW, I will not allow you to reschedule with us. . And as far as your statement " DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS", I don\'t capitulate to cancel culture and snowflakes. And anyone who is offended by facts should not book a lesson with us because I only speak the truth....well for as long as freedom of speech is still a right. It would appear censorship is alive and well. Welcome to the Orwellian dystopia.\n\nJust to let you know I was deeply depressed and frustrated by having my rights stripped away, my business shut down and being stuck inside my small apartment for months on end. I felt like my whole life was falling apart. My business which I have put my blood, sweat, and tears into for 15 years was dead and I was stressing out about it shutting down forever and surfing is know so my future seemed so dead. 2020 was the year planed on buying a house and possibly retiring and after the STAY AT HOME order, my whole future seemed lost. I am a social animal, an out doorsman and a waterman and all that was taken away from me. FYI I also I have a compromised immune system and I\'m 51, so I was hyper worried about the possibly of catching the virus and possibly dying. Also being a surfer, drowning is my greatest fear and as we know those who are seriously affected basically drown in their own fluids. Seeing my country that I so love and served for being decimated, seeing the world fall into choas and all because of a cover up. So No, renaming the virus will change it\'s origin.\n\nPerhaps you should direct your angst and frustration for the global implications due to a cover up that has cost trillions of dollars, put millions of small business out of business forever, countless people suffering, lost homes, lost jobs, tens of thousands of people dead and dying, the families that have to morn their loss, etc, etc, etc..... But no wait.... you did your part! You wrote a bad review! now you are a true activist you have stood up for... what? CPP narrative, the far left, and censorship,....  YAAYYYYY!!!! Go celebrate yourself. Sheepeople like you disgust me. Get a life.'}<//Response>< GmapID>

<Text>My son and I had a fantastic lesson with Will this morning on Venice Beach. He was great and was able to help both of us at the same time even though we were different levels. Will was friendly, knowledgeable, and encouraging. Every interaction with anyone in the company was 5 star. I would HIGHLY recommend them for your surfing needs!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

My experience was once in a lifetime! I was a first time surfer and I thought the teaching process was great for someone with little experience. I had Clay as an instructor who was super nice and encouraging and I would highly recommend trying surfing with them. Location was great and the waves and water were beautiful!!! 10/10!< /Text>

<Text>After drowning for 3 hours in Costa Rica and not getting up once, I was scared I was going to have a rough surfing experience on Venice Beach. Will and Carl were such great instructors I got up on my first wave! Not only were they instructive and informative, they were laid back and personable. Highly Recommended!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

My lesson at kapowui was a great way to start the morning and learn how to surf.  My instructor Colston was diligent, clear and enthusiastic when teaching.  By the end of the lesson I had caught a number of waves and felt more confident.  I highly recommend !</Review>

Perhaps the most surprising thing about the class was the nice wet suits they loan you. They are a much better quality than you typically get when you rent wet suits, and keep you much warmer in the water. We were in the water for an hour and I didn't even feel the cold at all.<//Review><Rate>5<//Rate><GmapID>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9</GmapID><resp>{'time': 1562184247520, 'text': 'Yeww thank you alot !\nwe keep our kapowui stand 🤙'}</resp>< UserId.>

Super positive, super chill and super determined to help me ride a wave(although I was struggling pretty bad in the beginning!). He said "you will ride a wave! I promise you bro!" He helped me with my technique as well as my confidence...I appreciated the lesson a ton and I will definitely be doing another soon. #kapowi< /Review>< pics>

<Text>Our experience with Kapowui for my kiddo's first time surfing today was outstanding. All the folks we interacted with were really nice and friendly. The instruction was thorough and easy to understand. Todd was great! He was easy going and let things roll at his pace. Great 1 on 1 teaching and patience. The waves were really rough and he helped him get out beyond the breakers, which was pretty challenging. I would highly recommend Kapowui and Todd.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Being from the east coast we don't get to do much surfing over here, which is why I had to book a lesson while on vacation in Santa Monica. Ruben (my instructor) and the whole staff were super chill. The coolest people I met during my whole trip. Ruben showed me the ropes and had me up and riding waves point break style in no time. One last thing, Pay for the GO Pro package!!!, its such a surreal moment you're going to watch it over and over again.</review>< Pics>

Carl was an amazing guide and really helped us feel comfortable in the water. By the end of the lesson we managed to ride waves on our own and even spot a pod of dolphins right next to us. It was supper fun and I can’t wait to go back tomorrow.<//text>

I had a great experience with Kapowui; the instructor (Thierry) was attentive and knowledgable. They provided necessary gear, kept my things safe during the lesson, and taught me how to surf. Martin was a good coordinator--he took photos and guided us throughout the lesson. I could not have asked for a better two hours spent.< /text>

We had a blast! Juan was thorough, trustworthy, fun and cheering on us every waves we surfed. Juan is a lot of fun but also very focused. The owner was there as well and made sure we had fun. Super easy and chill business. Would def recommend and we might actually come back to learn more. Jeremy and Justine</Text>

Our instructor Colston was very knowledeable, and provides really helpful and detailed instructions. In order to help us catch a wave, he kept moving along the beach to find nice and easy waves, and also exchanged some bigger surf boards so it was easier to maintain balance. Eventually my friend and I both caught a wave by the end of the lesson! It was really fun and we're definitely down to surf again.<//Review>< Pics>

Explained everything well and clearly and really emphasized having fun. A wonderful experience all around.</Review>

Our two sons had the best surfing experience. From we first talked to Martin who was welcoming and a minute after had arranged with instructor Colston. Colston is an excellent instructor, he is precisely and specific all down to the details which makes the difference. He is also a very nice and likable person. We will definitely go back and we will tell everybody about Kapowui. We wish we could give more stars. Absolutely fantastic.<//text>

My friend and I did a 2 hour surf session yesterday morning with Will and it was amazing! We had so much fun. It was my first time surfing and Will did a great job of making me feel comfortable! All of the employees were so kind to us and they even gave us a souvenir keychain of the Kapowui Bus. One of the South African instructors let us borrow his organic sunscreen too. We highly recommend this company to anyone looking to catch some gnarly waves!!!< /Text>

These guys are fantastic. I’ve worked with Martin and Colston who were great. Made me feel very comfortable. Very professional and knowledgable. Nice guys. Would absolutely recommend learning with them. I was up on a wave lesson 1.<//review>

Walked up to the bus and asked if I could take some and they hooked me up with two other first timers and Ryan had us all catching waves in no time! It was exactly the experience I was hoping for.

<Review>WOW. There aren't enough words to portray how AWESOME of a time this was! The best time of my life, so exhilarating, and left me feeling incredible. Leon was so courteous and understanding- he's a PHENOMENAL teacher and took such good care of me and my partner. It was our first time surfing and Leon made us feel like pros. I genuinely loved it and instantly wanted to book another lesson. Everyone at Kapowui was so nice and made us feel instantly like apart of their surfer family. Loved it loved it loved it! Thank you Leon, and THANK YOU KAPOWUI for making our first time surfing not only the highlight of our trip to LA, but the one of the best times in our entire lives!<//Review><Name>Becky Yeboah</Name><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_id>

<text>Kapowui is awesome!!!!! Being a first time surfer in California Nofar had me up on day one. It’s been a awesome experience. She has taught me to find waves, how to catch waves and the right techniques to standing up and balancing. I will definitely surf with Kapowui when I come back to California!!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Martin is the best coach in the universe!!! Me and my friend had a 1.5 hour class. Martin helped catch the best waves. All of us succeeded standing up on the board! Choose Kapowui if you are a surfing beginner!!!</Text>

<text>My husband, 22 year old daughter and 16 year old son had a beginner surf lesson with Ryan on July 24,  2019.  It was a highlight of our California vacation!  After a tutorial on the beach they headed into the water. Ryan was there with them the whole time and worked with each of them alternately.   They had the best time!</text>< Date>

Hope there is a Kapiwui Surf Club as well!

<Review>Overall, the instructor was attentive and clear. This was a private lesson for 2 people who had never surfed before for 2 hours. We went early enough that we weren't really competing for space in the water, which made the first half of the experience good. In the second hour another instructor with 4 or 5 people joined us and it felt a bit crowded. The other instructor was barking out orders at his group, drill sergeant style. The experience felt authentic, though when we returned to the van, the instructor was rushed into his next lesson, which didn't feel personable at all. He was told to get some water and we hand shook and were sent off. He was good and knew how to act/what to say when the waves were rough to keep us calm. When I booked the lesson, I took the time to review each instructor, and chose the specific one I wanted, on purpose. I chose Lulu and wanted to surf with her, but when we got there, it was somebody else, without warning. He was good, though not what I paid the $220 for. If you go, go early, and don't bet 100% that you will get the instructor you've chosen, if you took the time to do your research.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1535918542060, 'text': "Sonya, as to your 1st issue, about there being to many people in the water, we are allowed  by the city to do our lessons in a specific permitted Zone so we and there are many sand bars, rips, swimmers,  and other hazards the instructor has to take into account to insure your are in the safest and best area. Issue 2, barking instructor,  each instructor has his own teaching style. Issue 3, lesson finishing and you not thinking it was personable,  we book our lessons back to back especially in the summer on a Saturday , so the instructors can maximize their income for the year since this is a seasonal job and they have 5 months to make their money for the year. I'm not sure what you expected your instructor to do after the lesson was over. Each instructor has multiple jobs requirements other than just doing lessons, so getting water is necessary so we can clean wet suits between lessons. We have had multiple instructors quit recently due to burn out and I should have been at the beach to help out but I had my own issues. Issue 4,  you not getting the instructor you booked online, Lulu quit so there was no way for you to get her, and as it clearly states on my website you are not guaranteed the instructor you book online. Sounds like the instructors did everything they were suppose to do.  I'm sorry we didn't meet your expectations. It's reviews like this that really bum me out."}< /Response>

I had an awesome morning surf lesson with Will. He had me up and catching some waves in no time. It was super easy to book through their website and all communication was timely and helpful.</Review>

Booked a 2 hour surf lesson with Travis on Friday the 3rd of May. Never been surfing before so I was a little bit nervous but needn't have been.
The guys could not have been more welcoming and my instructor Travis could not have been more helpful and engaged.
The surf lesson started off with a pod of dolphins swimming close off shore and just got better from there.
Travis had me standing up on my first wave on my second attempt and I had just an awesome time for the next 2 hours.
My only regret was I left this lesson till the last day of my holiday. If I had a few more days I would have been back.
Would recommend Kapowui to anyone looking to learn how to surf and get some of that Californian surfing spirit.</review>

The instructors are incredibly positive and willing to share their passion for surfing with you, which makes for a great experience. They are also great at explaining and helping you to focus on the fundamentals that will help you to catch awesome waves, and do an amazing job of making you feel safe in the water, even if the surf is rough.

Shout out to Todd for being an awesome instructor. I enjoyed my lesson so much that I immediately scheduled a follow-up. I can't wait to learn more about surfing with Kapowui!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9< /Gmap_id><rate>5< /rate><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Incredible experience with The Kapowui gang!! Had a 90min lesson with Travis who improved my knowledge and helped improve my skill set so much!! Had a group session booked for the next day but since it was all beginners they called up Clay and he showed up (even tho he had the morning off to sleep in!) and he came to do a private lesson with me so we could work going down the line. Clay and Travis were both very kind and knowledgeable. Martin, the owner made sure my quick weekend trip was full of waves, fun and a super chill staff to hang with. Super easy to find the adorable vans in front of the beach and they set you all up. All the staff asked numerous times if I had any additional questions or anything else I wanted to try. Extremely helpful and I learned SO much! Uber will drop you off right in front of the vans, like a 50ft walk. I’ll be going back any time I’m in Venice for sure! Can’t say enough great things about the Kapowui crew! Go catch some waves!< /Review>< response>

Booking my lesson online was just as smooth as everything else that followed - finding the location, meeting our instructor Carl, learning the fundamentals of surfing, wiping out and having fun! There is parking exactly in the area where the “VAN” is set up and if you come during the week it’s even easier to find a parking spot. I originally booked for a morning appointment but our instructor, Carl, text early and if we could come at 1 in the afternoon because wave conditions would be more favorable.  I totally appreciated that and agreed.  Full body wetsuits were provided and we even opted for to GoPro recordings. Carl was with my 15 year old son and I one on one every time and made us both feel very safe and knowledgeable.  I am utterly fearful of water, but Carl completely helped me conquer that very quickly.
I highly recommend these guys!</Review>

<text>Todd was a very thorough instructor and I learned a ton. I was able to get up and start riding waves after just 2-3 attempts. I would recommend for anyone visiting the area and wanting to cross Surfing off their bucket list.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9< /Gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures><time>1570292925216< /time>< Response>

Dylan took his time to explain the basics and makes you fairly comfortable before you even step in the water. Very positive attitude towards the whole thing. I think I was given a suit too big but was still a good experience.<//Review>

<Text>BEST first surf lesson!! I found Kapowui because I googled "best surf lessons Santa Monica" and am so glad that I found Kapowui. I chose Kapowui over the other options based on previous testimonials and reviews. The website made it clear that the Kapowui team is truly dedicated to the experience that their clients have. The instructors were extremely welcoming and outgoing. After my lesson I decided to schedule one more for the following day because I had so much fun. Thanks for the great experience, Kapowui, keep doing what you're doing!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9< /Gmap_id></record>

I get a 2hour lesson from Haylee and she was the best teacher I ever had. I used to know how to swim and had learned water skiing and snorkeling before, but I still was a bit nervous about surfing because it was my first time. But Haylee explained surfing in detail and easily so that I could understand without difficulty. She also gave me a lot of encouragement and praise so I could relax and adjust to surfing quickly. If anyone is afraid of surfing, but has a desire to learn, I would definitely recommend Haylee!< /review>

<review>All the guys were super friendly and Raymond, my instructor, knew what he was doing and he helped me a lot. After getting a wetsuit and board we spent about half an hour on the sand going through the basics of the board, standing, tips, etc. We spent the rest of the lesson in the water. At first Raymond helped me to catch waves by pushing the board but I was soon able to paddle, catch and ride a wave by myself. I had a good time. I’m going back tomorrow to take my wife for her lesson. I highly recommend Kapowui.<//review>< time>

I've taken multiple lessons here, and each time leave feeling like I got my money's worth.  Very flexible for schedule changes, quality interactions with staff, and most importantly the teaching has been exceptional (I've used Colston).  Can't recommend enough!< /Text>

The ideal surfing lesson spot! Booked a private lesson with Ryan, who is the man! He seamlessly and carefully instructed us as fist time surfers, it was so much fun. Ryan made learning surfing easy! 10/10 would recommend!<//text>

This was the best first surfing experience ever. Nofar was my teacher and she explained everything so well, that I caught many waves right away. I would recommend anyone that wants to learn surfing to come to Kapowui.<//Review>

Kapowui was one of the best experiences I've had with a business, everyone I spoke to made me feel welcome. Took my first ever surf lesson with Ruben, and could not recommend him enough. Would also recommend the GoPro package.

I took the 2 hour lesson, which felt like a perfect length. I thought I might spend quite a bit of time on the beach going over the basics, but Ruben got me in the water and on waves super quickly.

Every time I fell, he'd point out one thing to try and focus on for the next run, and it would make such a difference each time. We would tackle simpler waves to nail down the new points, and every now and again he'd throw me more of a challenge, which usually resulted in me falling over but that's how you learn. By the end of the session, was standing up the whole way to the sand, even if i was a little wobbly. I've always wanted to try surfing, and could not stop smiling all morning.

It's very clear Martin (the owner) takes great care in choosing all his instructors, you'll have a fantastic experience with any of them.</text>

I signed myself and two of my good friends up for a group surfing lesson (Kapowui does group lessons at discounted rates!) and I am so glad I chose them. First of all, they have the coolest surfer van with rentable surfboards and wetsuits of varying sizes for everyone, and the parking was not difficult nor expensive at the time that we went (early morning on Sunday).

I was the only true beginner at the lesson, my two girlfriends had surfed before in the past, but both of them said afterwards that the instruction was very enlightening and made it that much better and easier to surf with success; they learned a lot. All three of us were standing on our boards and able to surf toward the shore on some whitewashes in no time :) Todd was our awesome teacher and he spent the first 30 minutes of our 2 hour session just explaining basic physics of the board and ideal positioning and technique to get up on the board, and then the full 1.5 remaining hours we were just in the water. I really appreciated his sincere and supportive attitude as a teacher! We also met Martin and his chill Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and both he and Todd just had the best vibes. Good people.

If you want to learn to surf I couldn’t give you a stronger recommendation to go with them! They are the best and I am so inspired to keep at it :) thank you Kapowui 🙏🏻< /review>

<Text>What an awesome Experience! I signed up with Leon for myself and my two girls age 14 and 9  to try out surfing for the very first time. With not much expectation and nerves setting in , Leon managed to keep us calm and motivated for the lesson. We then did a very helpful 30 min beach lesson about the correct techniques of surfing and once we had that down we were out in the water and within the first few waves we were all up and surfing.

This was an experience that we will never forget with a very big thanks to Kapowui and Leon for being so kind and enthusiastic throughout the lesson.

We will surely be back next year!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

What an amazing experience. Mother Nature held up her end of the bargain, Carl did the rest. Couldn’t have been a smoother day at the beach. Parking is super easy, but make sure to get there early. Also don’t forget to say hi to Lilly, their resident mascot and adorable Cavalier King Charles puppy. Highly recommend.<//text>

My first time learning to surf was a great experience. The folks at Kapowui are well organized, great with communication, and very professional. I booked with them, showed up at the correct time, and they took care of  all the rest.
My instructor was Juan. I was riding waves after my 3rd try, thanks to his help. I had a ton of fun, and took home memories that i will treasure forever.
If you're looking to surf in LA, look no farther. You've found it!

<Review>I enjoyed a lot! It was my first time and it’s kinda important - thought I ruined my preparations, as spent a magical night before at Ty Segall show and had a just renter car towed - the idea to still make my first lesson at 7am was the best idea!

Kapowui instructor Colston was an energetic competent instructor who managed to get our 15 yr.old son up on the waves surfing in no time.
We just walked up and asked if he could teach our son to surf and he had no other booked lessons at the time and was eager and willing to help us out. Our son had a private lesson for 1.5 hours with Colston and is was very affordable (cheaper than Disneyland).
Colston was easy to chat with and knowledgeable about surfing. Our son had a great time and is wanting to surf more. Unfortunately, we are from Alberta, Canada so his surfing dreams will have to wait until we come back again.
Thanks Colston and Kapowui Surfing for a great afternoon at the beach riding the waves!<//Text>

My brother and I had a fantastic time on Sunday learning to surf with Kapowui! We found them based off of their reviews and booked our appointment with Martin in the morning on Sunday. Come 10am, we were with Juan who had to be the best and most energetic instructor we could have found! Juan taught us from the basics on the beach into how to ride a wave in the water! Got both of us up on the boards surfing within a short span of time! Excellent customer service from Martin, Juan, and everybody else here. Thanks for the great experience! 👍< /text>

Nofar gave the BEST lesson to my niece & nephew visiting from Texas. She gave them great instruction and both kids, 13 & 10 years old, were able to get up and ride the waves! I would highly recommend Kapowui surf lessons!!! Great experience!!!!</text>

We had a fantastic time this morning learning how to surf. All three of us have never surfed before and Ed was a brilliant teacher. He made sure we understood the moves, kept us safe at all times and made the experience so much fun! We can’t recommend Ed and Kapowui highly enough.</Text>

We had the 9am Group surf lesson on a Sunday. I expected a full parking lot but it wasnt packed at all. Plenty of room to park in the morning but it does get more crowded later on in the day. Our instructor Todd was an awesome person very knowledgable and big on safety. If your looking for surf lessons no matter what experience you are these guys are the ones!</text>

We received a one hour couple's lesson with Travis as a birthday gift. It was really fun and we got all the kit we needed. Within half an hour we were standing on our surf boards despite this being our first time! Thank you so much and thanks for making our trip to LA memorable!< /Review>

Today, Juan taught me and my boyfriend how to surf. Our friend Hailee recommended us to Kapowui and Juan, and she told us that he would be patient, nice and fun. Juan went above and beyond to provide us with a good first surfing experience that was safe, fun and memorable. Definitely try out Kapowui and ask for Juan!< /text>

I had a great time catching some waves with Todd this morning. Thanks to Todd for breaking everything down in an easy to understand way and ensuring it was a safe and fun experience. I couldn’t have had a better instructor. Also thanks to Hailee for pointing me in the right direction! I definately plan on returning for more lessons.<//Review>

We got back a few minutes late (why does walking back always take longer?) so they got right to work!  The surf was very rough and Todd let us know that surfing would likely be difficult. However,  everyone got to ride a wave or two and all had a super time!! Thanks so much- and we will be back again some day!!<//Review>< gmapID>

<Text>Our instructor Leon was incredible. He explained everything carefully on the beach before heading into the water. When we were in the water, he stayed next to us to help us catch the best waves, told us what to do, and gave us a push - all while swimming. He is very experienced and helped us have a fun and safe time.< /Text>< pictures>

I found kapowui surf lessons on google and I'm really glad I did because as soon as I took the first lesson I instantly fell in love with the company.  Venice beach is a  great spot for beginners but also people who want to improve on their surfing skills which was my case. I surfed for seven days with my instructor, Clay, he helped me improve tremendously and I really  enjoyed surfing with him. He's a very fun guy to be around with and he was very patient with me . I definitely recommend Clay and this company to other people and I'm sure you will enjoy it just as much as I did! I will definitely be back next summer. YEWWW</Text>

<review>i just did a 2 hour private surf lesson with Colston and it was amazing! they provide you with all of the gear you need (wetsuit, board) so all you need to do is show up in your bathing suit. i’ve never surfed before and am not a strong swimmer but none of that mattered when you’ve got a great instructor. Colston walked me through everything and was so great that I was able to get up on the 5th try and had such a great time. i highly recommend kapowui for newbies and experienced surfers, i’d definitely come back!</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Carl is the greatest surf instructor; his patience, knowledge, skills, and sense of humor made our experience perfect! He even surfed a wave per my request. Overall, the team is a ragtag bunch of young hot guys and one bitchin’ tough chic from Israel! Don’t go anywhere else to learn surfing it to VW buses in the parking lot on Venice Beach!< /review>

<text>Carl was very knowledgeable and catered to everyone’s experience in the 6 person group class I was in. Carl taught everyone the basics on the beach and then helped everyone in the water and ensured they got to ride multiple waves. Top tier equipment rental included in the lesson. 10/10 experience for a first time surfer 🤙</text>< date>

Really liked my experience at Kapowui.
Very nice staff, lacking a bit of organisation but overall good. I would recommend the 1h30 lesson if you’re beginning, 1h is too short.</text>

<Text>I had a wonderful experience at Kapowui recently! My dad and I took a 2 hour surfing lesson with Jeremie and had a great time. Jeremie was fun, friendly, and professional, and did a good job tailoring things to our (slightly) different experience levels. The equipment at Kapowui was high quality, and the van was super fun and easy to find. I wouldn't hesitate to book with them again in the future!</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

In the first 20 minutes he thoroughly and patiently explained me the theory of surfing, and then he was a supportive teacher who helped me to catch big waves of Venice Beach.  With him beside me, I had no fear of diving under the more than 1,5 m high waves. Having never surfed before, just after one lesson I know how to stand on the board, how to catch the wave, and I surely would repeat this great experience and would like to make surfing my hobby. Would highly recommend Kapowui and Leon as an instructor.<//Text>< user_name>

Was in town for college visits, so I stopped by to get a surfing lesson. Nofar is incredible, honestly one of the funniest and helpful instructors out there. She helped me get up, ride those ‘big’ waves, and find a new passion in surfing even though I definitely messed up more than a few times.

I’ll definitely come surf again when I’m in Cali. Hopefully I’ll do better next time 🤙🏽 Mahalo, Kapowui!</Review>

< review>
As a couple we had an awesome time with Leon for our first surf lesson. We both managed to stand most waves from the beginning, with Leon taking care that we tried proper waves for a beginner. In the beginning he made sure that we get to speed by pushing us into the waves while swimming himself. It was a great experience and we never felt unsafe, even with quite big waves during high tide.< /review>

Just surfed 2 hrs with kapowui and had an amazing time. My instructor, nofar was so kind and helpful and cheered me on the whole time. I’m fairly new to surfing and got up on the board about 4 or five times! Definitely would recommend this surf club</Text>

What can I say about Kapowui? I can say that I will always recommend  them to ANYONE looking to try their hand at surfing. Todd was beyond amazing. Made us feel comfortable, zero intimidation, and very informative. If this is a dream of yours, you can certainly book with confidence when it comes to Kapowui.< /text>

{'time': 1564574871639, 'text': "Hi Venessa, this is Martin the owner of kapowui. I'm very sorry and disappointed that you left feeling this way. I really wish you would have talked to me before you left and then I could have addressed your issues in person. Your instructor, Nofar thought you loved your lessons, because you seemed so happy and stood up so much, she was actually shocked that you left with out leaving a tip that's how certain she was  you had a great time.  I've talked to Nofar and found out what happened. As far as comparing you to the other person in your lessons, it was not to make you feel uncomfortable it was just stating facts and  explaining to you why you were learning a different techinque than the other guy in your lesson. Because you were less flexible than the guy so she had to personalize your pop up technique to accommodate your inflexibility and body type. She did this so you would have a chance of standing up, and it worked, you stood up multiple times. Just to let you know there are many ways to teach a the pop up, one way does not work for all people, so we match the technique to the individual, otherwise only 50% of our lessons would stand up compared to 100%.  As far as yelling at you in the lesson, Nofar would never do that in a mean way. What you have to realize is she's trying to give you feedback on every wave so you can progress and learn as much as possible in the short time we have with you. So every time she pushes you in a wave she watches you till you fall so she can give you feed back on what you did wrong and she needs to do this immediately before she forgets what and this must be done over cacophony of crashing and breaking waves. So you are right she was yelling, but only so you could hear her, not because was mad, frustrated, or disappointed in you. I hope this helps you understand more about what transpired during your lesson and ease any disappointment you have felt. Perhaps now with this new knowledge and understand you can look back with fond memories of your lesson. I'm not going to ask you to change your review but now that you have a better understanding of what happened I hope you reconsider your review score. Lastly I'm really bummed out you left feeling this way, if you are ever back in town stop by and I'll talk to you in person and we'll see what we can do to make your next lesson live up to your expectations. Sincerely Martin."}<//Resp>

<Review>The instructor with the blonde hair and blue eyes who told us from she was from another country. Compared me to another on the group lesson saying I wasn't as flexible as my counterpart and later yelled at me the whole entire lesson in the water stating I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do so it made it more mentally challenging while I observed the other instructors not yelling at their customers wishing to be in their group.  I was disappointed because this was the one activity in Santa Monica, California I was looking forward to doing....learning to surf.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>Had my first surfing lesson with Raymond, coolest experience of my life, I even was able to ride several waves under his guidance. If you ever head down to Venice and want to surf, get some lessons from Raymond. He is a real cool dude that will make sure you are having a good time and will get you riding those waves in no time. Thanks again dudes it was awesome!</Text>< user>

<Review>290 reviews at this time at an average of 5 stars. And for good reason. Every one of the instructors I interacted with was over the top friendly, and my personal instructor, Ryan, did an incredible job making sure I was trying waves that were within my comfort zone and tried to push me further every time I got on the board. I’ve had the impression that some surfers can be a bit snobby about the sport, and these guys weren’t in any way.  I can’t compare it to any other surf schools, because this is the only one I’ve done and the only one I’ll ever need. I’ll definitely be renting a board from them again in the near future until I get comfortable enough to buy my own. There’s no doubt these guys will get you up and surfing. I cannot recommend them enough.< /Review>< userid>

Never surfed before and I got up !! at 46 :).
Can't compare to other schools but would not hesitate to recommend.
Had a no show due to illness so they adjusted the charge to reflect the smaller group, so thoroughly decent chaps as well !!<//review>

Can't say enough about Todd from Kapowui.  We booked family surfing for 4 ( two boys 12 and 15). Once we arrived Todd was greeted us and was so friendly , enthusiastic and knowledgeable.  This was the highlight of our vacation for sure. Highly recommended if you're considering to try surfing. This was our first time ever surfing - we had a great time.</text>

I brought my three children for surf-lessons. The instructors are amazing! They were patient and helpful. My middles daughter was the only one full-throttle the whole time. The rest of us we sort of wet blankets, but they encouraged us anyway. Next time, I will look into some sort of daily lesson for my daughter. I will definitely try again as well. We were all very motivated by the experience and the fantastic instructors.  This is a fantastic company!</text>

<text>Amazing experience!  I hadn’t been surfing in a few years so took a lesson to work out the kinks.  Todd was my instructor and he was so fun and positive.  He really pushed me and made sure I had the success I wanted out my lesson.  I’ll definately be back!  🙆‍♀️</text>< Name>

<review>I highly recommend this place!
Had my first ever surf lesson with Clay and another one with Jonny a couple days later and it was awesome!
Both of them are just fantastic surf instructors! They were so patient, funny and cool and got me to ride several waves under their guidance.
From the beginning it felt like they had taken me into their surfing family – I had such a good time and it sure was one of the coolest experiences! I'm still stoked thinking about it:)
If you ever want to surf in Venice, get some lessons at Kapowui!
And if you’re ever down to Cape town in the future reach out for Jonny!

Thanks again boys for your patience and your coolness, you are awesome!< /review>< Date>

Kapowui was awesome! I had DYLAN and he was unreal! He was super clear with instructions about the steps to help get you up and surfing in no time, but also all about safety! Choose Kapowui and you will be very pleased!!!< /Review>

<Text>There is a reason why these guys have 5 stars. Mark was a great instructor - he tailored the lesson around the way I move and helped me improve really quickly. Martin went out of his way to find a slot that worked for my tight schedule in LA. Great experience. The dolphins were a nice touch too! :-)</Text><name>Michael McCarthy<//name><resp>None< /resp>< time>

Amazing people and amazing lessons! Everyone at Kapowui is so friendly and helpful. I bought a package lesson with them, but even after I finished, they still offer to give me advice and tips. If you're even a little curious about surfing, just go for it - you won't regret it!</Text>

<review>Kapowui was awesome from the second we got there meeting Martin and matching our 14 yr old daughter and 9 yr old son with Todd. He was great with our kids...patient, informative, super helpful, down to earth and great sense of humor. If you want a great experience on the water, hire these guys. Worth every dollar.  We will be back, definitely!

The staff as a whole made us feel very welcomed as soon as we got there & at the end, made sure to ask us how our lesson was.
The owner himself was also very nice - made sure to introduce himself to everyone who came to get lessons.

Seriously a company with one of the best staff I've ever encountered! And I've traveled a lot...
Also very skilled teachers, nice equipment and easy to get to.
I really appreciated that Martin (aka. Kapowui) helped me and my friend out with our bikes - we had forgotten our lock to the bikes at home so he went home to get HIS own lock and lent it to us!!! That's service! And of course thanks to Todd for his patience with us and for being such a great teacher that we at least in the end could catch a wave! If I ever come back to Venice, I'll definitely go back to learn more cause it was so much fun! (So if you want to learn how to surf when in Venice - this is the place! Worth every penny!!)<//text>

We are a family of 3; Mom, Dad and 13yo daughter, who have never surfed before. We went out for a 2 hour lesson with Ruben. He was awesome, tailoring his instruction to each of our abilities. He made us feel comfortable and safe and we had an absolute blast with all of us catching waves by the end. We are going back today to rent boards for a short follow up session to continue our journey in surfing. Cannot say enough good things about Kapowui in general and Ruden in particular. Frick'n awesome.< /Text>

Ryan was amazing! He was so professional and patient as we learned to surf for the first time. Definitely recommend the 2 hour lesson, as we had so much time to catch waves!! We will definitely be returning for additional lessons!!<//Text>

I caught a wave! I've always wanted to surf but this was first surf lesson ever in 47 years.

My instructor, Nofar, was incredible.

Not just an extremely pleasant human to be around, she was very attentive to my needs in adjustments so I could successfully catch a wave.

They give you all the gear, lessons, encouragement, and celebration you need.

I think they got more excited for me when I got up and rode the wave than I did.

Great crew. Great gear. Great experience.

Highly recommend and if you can get Nofar, I'd advise it. She's just awesome!< /Text>

We had the GREATEST time surfing with Leon and Raymond (sea bear)! They were the absolute best instructors- great teachers and very patient! We were all beginner surfers and able to get up within 2 tries!! We cannot day enough about our instructors and their A+++ Attitude and interest in us. So easy to get along with and fun to hang with! We are going back tomorrow for another adventure! If you’re even remotely interested in surfing- give this place a try. Deff recommend Leon and Sea Bear as instructors as well. Hang 10🤙🏻< /Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Such an amazing, friendly, dedicated staff!! Moved to California about 8 months ago and always wanted to learn how to surf. My boyfriend and I just finished two 2-hour lessons with Mike.  Truly enjoyed every second of the experience. We were both catching waves the whole entire time thanks to a mini beach lesson beforehand and instruction in the water as well. Mike was a very knowledgeable and energetic instructor. He taught the basics, then let me determine how much I wanted to do and what else I wanted to learn. Easy guy to talk to and provided me with as much information, hints, and helpful reminders as possible. You can tell his passion for surfing and it came out while he was teaching. Highly recommend!!!<//Review>< GmapID>

Kapowui surf did an amazing job! We had a part of 8 and they were very accommodating and returned inquiries quickly. When out in the water the instructors were very organized and fun! I would definitely recommend Kupowui to anyone who is looking for surfing instruction in the Venice Beach area!<//review>

I had an exceptional experience learning to surf for the first time with Kapowui! They were very supportive and their fun-loving attitude definitely helped to feel confident and welcomed on the waves. The customer service was excellent and I felt like I received the attention I needed to make the most out of my session. I even got a little token memento to remember the experience! if you're looking to learn to surf for the first time, or just need to rent a board, I recommend Kapowui 100%.<//Review>

My friend and I had our surf lesson with Will Ermish and with Elliot assisting.
I've had surf lessons in Bali before and this was by far the best lesson I've experienced.
Will was friendly and fun and his explanations clear and concise. We were taught technique and safety before heading into the water.
It was cold in the water that day and Will and Elliot were really patient and helpful.
We had so much fun, made good progress and more importantly I felt safe at all times. I've had a few scares before and getting back in the water with instructors whom I trust and felt safe with helped my confidence a lot.
We really enjoyed it! Thanks guys!< /Text>

First time surfing and it was awesome. 30 min or so of pop up training and learning about the board and safety things. Our instructor, Jeremie, was great and helped us a lot. The instructor is always out there with you and he lets you know when to get up and basically starts you off before you get up on the board. This was the best experience I’ve had and would recommend it to anyone wanting to try surfing for the first time.</review>

Words cannot begin to describe how cool and memorable my experience with Kapowui has been! If you are looking for a genuinely fun and potentially life changing experience in Southern California, this is your place!

I live in the middle of Europe, with the closest beach an 8 hour drive from my home, so surfing ocean waves is a HUGE step out of the comfort zone for me. Despite having no experience whatsoever with any board sports, no knowledge of waves or anything remotely related to surfing, my instructor, Will had me catching several cool waves and riding them all the way to the beach within about 40 minutes of arriving at the beach!

We started with a beach lesson where I was shown what to do, proper technique, and given safety advice, and then we headed into the water. After a couple of falls, I started catching waves really fast. The instructor stands with you in the water and helps catch your first waves, gives pointers on what to do different next time to improve, so it is a quick learning curve and very very gratifying. Having had zero previous experience, it was an unbelievably cool feeling to be able to stand up and ride a wave so quickly.

I was hooked instantly, so actually went back for a second lesson during my short stay in LA. I really recommend you do that too, as the second time your body already has some memory of this new activity and the experience is even more gratifying! I was catching waves with more confidence the second time!

All the guys I met at Kapowui, Will, my awesome instructor, Martin, the owner, and the other instructors too, everyone was super friendly and nice. They are also very flexible with scheduling your lesson, and actually recommend the best time on that particular day, checking tides, etc.

Anytime I am in LA in the future, I will be there at the beach catching waves with these guys! You got a new lifetime customer, and what is even cooler, a new fan of surfing! <3

One more note about why I wrote “potentially life-changing experience” above. It truly has been that for me. Surfing for the first time last week with Will turned out to be a huge lesson on my own fitness level (actually, lack thereof), my ability to face setbacks and my fears (getting washed out by a huge wave is terrifying at first… and then you cope with it…because you have to - how many times do you get to practice that within a one-hour timeframe?). These two sessions with Kapowui have actually opened up my mind and heart to several new goals to work toward in life… an unexpected, but very welcome bonus not mentioned on Kapowui’s website. :)

Thank you soooo much guys, I will be back! :)

P.S.: one more thing… a day after my lesson I sat at the beach looking at a bunch of guys trying surfing for the first time, being instructed by someone obviously not trained to do so (probably a friend or volunteer). They caught exactly zero waves in the one hour or so, and left tired but frustrated by the experience. As I mentioned, I have zero knowledge of surfing, yet even I could tell from a distance that they were sitting at the wrong spot in the water, and not shown properly what to do and when. They should have saved themselves the frustration and get a lesson with Kapowui instead! :)

See you Kapowui, very soon! <3< /Review>

<review>Had an awesome experience with Kapowui. Surfing was on the bucket list so my girlfriend and I researched the best place to take lessons within 20 miles of Marina Del Rey. Kapowui had the best reviews online so we booked two, 2 hour lessons on a weekend. The hype going in didn't disappoint because I don't know how we could have had a better experience!

Mike was awesome from start to finish. We were able to get up by the end of day one (which was a blast to do), and by the end of day 2 we were both paddling and getting up on our own. It was just what we were looking for! Mike knew exactly how and when to push us to continue getting better and having fun. And he was a solid guy!

After two days, I'm hooked! We're both going out this week to buy our own boards to keep up the new hobby!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Gmap_id>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9</Gmap_id><userid>109938032829970432504<//userid></record></dataset><record>

<review>Had a great time learning how to surf with the one and only Juan. He taught me everything I needed to know to catch my first waves. We had some good laughs. 2 hours of lessons felt like 30 mins, it was a lot of fun. I met Martin Squires, great guy, very personable. He runs an awesome company and I would highly recommend others to see him and his crew for surf lessons while in the area.< /review><Name>Aaron Narain</Name><Rating>5< /Rating><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>104571082301814522921< /UserId.></record>

<review>Had a two hour lesson with Jeremie and it was amazing. He was patient, always gave good feedback and was well worth the money. He was able to push each person to progress at their own pace and we were very pleased. We intend to do it again soon. So glad that we found them.< /review><rating>5<//rating><Name>K Argonza< /Name><GmapID>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9<//GmapID></record>

Having never done any board sport before, I was a bit nervous about trying to surf, but after reading tons of positive reviews I decided to go for it. And let me tell you, I'm beyond glad I did. Taking a surf lesson with Jay was one of the best experiences I could possibly recommend to anyone in the area looking to learn to surf, and really just enjoy themselves on the water. The lot was really easy to find, especially with the VW buses right by the entrance. Throughout the lesson, Jay was super genuine and friendly, and really helpful- giving feedback on every wave for how to do better on the next one. I had a great time, and I'll absolutely return for another lesson the next time I'm in town.<//text>

My Instructor Ryan was more than Professional!
It was like surfing with a friend!
Payment is also easy as shopping;)
Cash, Card or your Blood!😉
No worries, the Guys are very cool.
They aren’t wasting any time with stupid stuff.
only the most important things at the Beach , everything else in the Water!

Perfect !!!!!

<Review>Just had a lesson with Will at Kapowui Surf Club and absolutely loved it. Will was both personable and helpful. The lesson was very thorough and started with instruction on technique and safety on the beach before heading out into the water. I had a blast and felt like I improved in only the hour I spent in the water. I would definitely take a lesson again and would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in learning to surf.< /Review>< Pictures>

I had an awesome experience with my private lesson with Kapowui. I didn't pick a particular instructor and trusted them to pair me with the best one based on my experience for my lesson. I worked with Leon for 2 hours and it was amazing, we joked that we should just book another 4 to keep going! As I had surfed before and was moving onto green waves (unbroken) I was super stoked to have a 1:1 and conquer the next phase. Leon's instructions were clear and his coaching was very encouraging. We did a lot of laughing, hanging, and catching waves and it was exactly what I needed. I was definitely bummed to see the 2hours end. He's among my top 2 surf instructors/experiences to date. Highly recommend.< /text>

<text>We had an Awesome time today learning to surf.  Leon was our instructor and he was amazing with myself and my 3 kids.  My teenage boys learned quickly from him and he even got my daughter(who's terrified of the ocean) to give it a try.  She ended up LOVING it and kept going back to catch more waves.  I highly recommend Kapowui Surf Lessons for you and your family!</text>< pics>

< Review>
Such great guys! We called from 5 minutes away and they still made time for us. Will was so patient with our "somewhat tough" 12 yr old and my 17 yr old had an instant connection. His instructions were clear and his sense of humor was infectious! He kept things light, uplifting, and positive from beginning to end which is rare in any style of coaching. They were both up on their boards in no time. Luke and Tucker will remember California surfing from a true surfer forever! Thanks for playing such a great part in our trip from Alabama!< /Review>

I had friends visiting from out of town and five of us took a lesson for the first time with Kapowui and it was a great experience!! We had a lot of fun and even though the tide was a little rough we all got up on some pretty sweet waves! The instructors were all super friendly, helpful, and patient with us. Gear was all in good condition. I would definitely consider going back for more lessons and would recommend it to anyone considering taking a lesson! :)</Review>

< review>
We wanted to do something special for my grandsons when they visited from the Atlanta area. We thought they would really enjoy the surfing experience so I searched the internet and kept coming up with great reviews on Kapoui. I started corresponding with Martin, the owner, to build the best experience for the boys. He set us up with Todd for morning and afternoon lessons. The entire process and lessons went great. Todd was the perfect instructor for them. He was friendly, outgoing, patient and gave them a  surfing experience that they will always remember. Both boys was thrilled and talked about it all night.  Martin ensured that everything exactly as planned.

I would highly recommend Kapowui to anyone looking for that first time surfing experience. And if you are in the LA area and what to give you child or grandchild a memorable experience surfing with Kapoui is the place to go. I have to say that Todd was an outstanding instructor and we would use him again durning the boy's next visit.  However, while there I had to opportunity to see the other instructors in action and they all were extremely qualified.</review>

It was so nice to meet you and thank you for allowing us to teach your grand children how to surf. Todd says " hi and thank you" also. I\'m stoked they were stoked. Hope to see and talk to you again the next time you are in town, later brother, Martin'}< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Cool crew, Todd was a good instructor for a group lesson of three people, waves were strong but a little rough and it was tough to paddle out but we all rode waves and everyone was safe and had fun.< /text>

<text>My 11 and 13 year old kids took a 90 minute lesson with Todd. They had an excellent time. The vans are easy to find at the parking lot. The staff greeted us and got the kids into wet suits and onto the sand quickly. If we have time they want to do another lesson before we leave LA. That says it all.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I actually didn't take the lessons, but I did use the rental service to get a paddle board! I have never experienced such a friendly, affordable, and laid back rental company. Martin was so cool! He helped us understand how to stand up on the board, launch past the shore in to steadier water, and gave me a piece of mind about safety. He was so great and I would absolutely recommend him and his company to everyone I know! Thanks for such a great experience :)</text>

<text>My wife and I just took a 90 mins stand up paddle board lesson with Greg and loved every minute of it.  We had never paddle boarded before and the conditions were not exactly ideal for beginners - choppy and windy!!
Greg was clear in his instruction and set our expectations perfectly. He got us up and boarding in no time and made it a really fun activity.
Whether it’s your first time or a refresher lesson, Greg is an excellent instructor and a really good guy to hang out with on the water.
Kapowui and Greg are your “go-tos” in LA.</text><response>None< /response><Rating>5</Rating><time>1563148190770</time>< user_id>

I’m 13, and I had such a great time here. All the staff especially Todd and Martin are so welcoming and kind. They will have you standing and comfortable on your board in no time. I had two consecutive lessons with Todd, and he was great. If you are interested in learning to surf or have already surfed elsewhere this is the place for you.<//Review>

We were a mix of surfers - from absolutely no experience to having surfed a handful of times -and the format fit our needs perfectly.  The on land instruction gave even those of us that had surfed before a little extra insight into the how and why of what we were doing, and once we got in the water all of us had a blast being pushed into and catching our own waves.  Don't hesitate to book with Martin and his crew at Kapowui!</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

He was incredible and we all had a blast while learning to surf. My husband was skeptical of surfing and was afraid he wouldn’t get the hang of it. By his second try, he was surfing all the way to the shore. The Kapowui family was amazing and we all loved our time with Kapowui. We will definitely be returning for more surf visits!</text>< Rating>

Had a 2-hr lesson today with Todd for our family of four. Couldn't have asked for a better experience! Todd was awesome - patient, encouraging, relaxed, thorough. Kids and adults had a blast and everyone was able to get up at least once and ride a wave!! Location is also nice as it isn't a crowded section of Venice. We would come back to Kapowui, and Todd, in a second. He even had tokens for each of us when we were finished and I know the kids especially will cherish theirs!</review>

I had a 1:1 lesson with Todd. He is a great instructor and very thorough and patient. Cool dude!  I didn’t feel rushed and caught some great waves. Would highly recommend Kapowui.  I wish I had time to do a second lesson. I would suggest getting a package of two or three lessons if you have time.< /Text>

First time surfing and the waves were larger than expected, and extra challenging. My instructor (Jay) kept cool the whole time ensuring I was confident and still managed to get me up and riding. 10/10 would recommend these guys!<//Review>

I’m a Venice local of over 10 years and have tried several summers to learn how to surf properly without success.
I finally booked a lesson on a whim and Ryan’s easy to understand and spot on instructions made it click finally. I had a great time, felt really encouraged, empowered, and supported. I also felt safe and looked after despite the conditions being very intense in the ocean today. I felt like I learned more today than in all the years before combined.
What a friggin’ blast!
Cant wait to see the GoPro videos and book another lesson.< /text>

Couldn't have imagined spending our last day in Venice doing anything else besides spending the morning with Will in the water for our first surfing experience. Not only did we have a blast, he made sure we knew all of the tips and tricks to making our first time the best and most fun as possible. We came out of the water feeling super accomplished and so happy we picked them to help us check something off our bucket list that we've been wanting to try for a long time. We will be back soon and will head directly back to the guys at Kapowui. Highly recommend. You won't regret it.Thanks guys!!</Text>

Kapowui rocks! Great bunch of hard working instructors who are professional and willing to see you succeed! You get the full experience and if you lucky enough get to see the dolphins swim by at the same time! I recommend Kapowui from start to finish. They teach you the functioning of the board as well as the pop up technique and safety while being in the ocean. You feel like they help you to adapt to the ocean and the waves! Great team and alot of effort put in by the owner Martin! Be sure to let Lily the dog give you a high paw five! The guys will hoooot you all the way! Yeeeeeeeeewwwwwwww! 🤙🏼< /Review>

This’s guys pretty cool, gave me a really good deal that beat all previous offer I’ve been getting. Dont waste ur time, just go to him right away. Also give up bargaining with him, he’d give his last best offer right away.<//Text>

I had my first ever surf lesson with Juan at Kapowui just hours ago and it was amazing!!! Despite the fact that I managed to get a bloody nose and twisted ankle (no one's fault, life happens!), I had SO much fun! Juan was patient and kind. He was always checking in with me and encouraging me. I really appreciated his energy, even with my challenges. As Martin said to me after the lesson, I got my surf injuries out of the way early! :) I was super close to being able to stand up and I will definitely be back in a couple of weeks for another lesson. Mahalo for your time and patience with this newbie, Juan!<//text>

Had an awesome time surfing in Venice with Juan. When Kapowui princess Hailee recommended I check em out, I became curious and decided to give them a shot. Juan was a very down to earth, patient, and knowledgeable instructor. He gave me plenty of feedback to help up my game. Looking forward to my next class!<//review>

<text>Super fun session with Will this morning. Less than ideal conditions and we managed to find some really fun rides. I've been surfing for 3 years and he left me with just the right amount of pointers to work on. Highly recommended for a beginner or intermediate surfer looking to get more waves and have more fun out on the water. Stoked to get out for my next wave! #vanlife< /text>< Pictures>

Best part of our trip!!!!!!! (And our trip had lots of cool stuff!) We took 5 boys to learn to surf and couldn't be more pleased with the reservation process (accommodating, easy), instructor (in my son's words "#bestever")...will shout out to Jeremy because he took extra special care of our littlest guy while being completely attentive to the rest.  We loved him!  We even came back for a second lesson, two days later...that's how great this company is!  Thanks!</review>

<Review>One of the best decisions I made while visiting Venice Beach. Awesome name with awesome people. Marty and Kenny were both friendly and helpful! I wanted to learn how to surf for the first time and was kind of hesitant to go with an instructor from one of the other equipment rental shops. While walking along the front walk, my eye caught this beautiful orange van in a parking lot, stacked with colored boards.

I met Marty who explained to us that since the weather was suboptimal that morning, he would be robbing us of money if he gave us a lesson. Instead he proposed a day and time when he knew the ocean would be more forgiving and offered to take us then. I really appreciated Marty's integrity. I set up two lessons with Kenny, one of Marty's instructors whom I had the pleasure of meeting.  He was very friendly and gave us valuable instruction and trooped through some pretty rough waves to teach my buddy and I. This guy is top notch. My buddy caught waves on the first day and I caught quite a few more on the next, when the waters were a little lighter. Kapowui had great equipment, and Marty let us use his GoPro to take some awesome videos!

My trip to Venice Beach was made amazing thanks to Marty and Kenny. I highly recommend Kapowui!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

The staff was super helpful and patient. They ensured my husband and I caught multiple waves and even let us stay a little longer due to the low number of waves during our session. They are well worth the money in my opinion. We had an unforgettable experience.</review>

I am in my late 50s and my son is in his 20s. We signed up for lessons at Kapowui with Lulu and figured he would get up but not sure if I would. Well, not only did we both get up but son was able to catch a wave on his own a few times! Lulu was always positive and full of encouragement no matter how our ride went. I really liked how she prepped us for the surf on land and that she tirelessly pushed me into the waves so I could catch them. We had so much fun we are going to take another lesson next week. What a fantastic intro to surfing:)</review>

I have been meaning to write this for a while, because these people are so incredible and have given me the greatest gift - SURFING!

I started going to Kapowui in August and I have since started venturing out on my own (thanks to how much I learned from taking lessons here), however I find an excuse to go back and visit the Kapowui folks pretty much EVERY weekend because they are so great.  Martin is the absolute best, along with every one of the instructors working at Kapowui, and I have surfed with pretty much everyone!  They are SO passionate about surfing, and care very much about equipping you with the skills and training that you need to excel at the sport.  They will always be honest with you about the conditions, and whether or not they work well with your skill level.  Not to mention, everyone that works here has encyclopedic knowledge about surfing.

I cannot thank Martin and everyone at Kapowui enough for all the time they have spent with me, both in the water, but also answering all of my surf related questions, and generally just being supportive of me as a surfer newbie.

I also want to say that I have taken lessons at other surf schools in the area, and no one has held a candle to the level of passion and commitment and thoroughness that I have seen at Kapowui. Whether you have never surfed before, or you are a beginner/intermediate surfer looking to get some extra instruction and improve your skill set, or maybe just looking to rent a board and suit- GO HERE.  You will not be disappointed!< /review>

Booked lessons for our 7 and 9 year old boys with Nofar and Ryan, who were fantastic.  Nofar was patient with our 7 year old, and went to get him an extra wetsuit when he was cold and a boogey board when he got tired (but only after encouraging him to finish strong by getting up three more times).  Ryan had our 9 year old up early and often and quickly got him out deeper for bigger waves and longer rides—he worked tirelessly and was very enthusiastic.  Both boys had big smiles on their faces.  Would definitely recommend these instructors.</text>

This was my first surf lesson, and I couldn't be happier. The owner and instructors are very friendly and happy to share their passion for surfing with you. My instructor was Mark. Thank you Mark!!! He gave me an education about the board, the waves, the ocean's energy, safety, and more. There is something magical about your first off balance, unstable, "what am I doing" wave. When you nail your first ride....WOOOOHOOOOOO!!!! This will not be a one and done event for me. Kapowui Surf made my first experience educational, memorable, and happy. Definitely a 5 Star rating from me!!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</review>

If you want the best surfing experience in all of southern california...these are the guys you want to teach you! Not only are they the most experienced, they are fun!!! They will get you up the first time guaranteed! I have been surfing with them since last summer, and every single time I go out, not only do I get better...but I learn something new, and the fun just never stops. All of the coaches are simply amazing and will guide you through step by step. They are professional and courteous and will not only make memories of a lifetime...but friends for life. I'm hooked for life, and couldn't recommend a better school for anyone looking to learn or get better or simply just learn what being in the flow is all about!! 10 stars!! Kimberly L...<//Text>

He spent ample time walking me thru my board and body mechanics before hitting the water. Harry was absolutely the best, basically putting me right on the waves over and over again. Thr dolphins came out to play with us and it was just super chill. Harry refused to leave until I got a ride all the way in which I did and now i'm hooked.

Really good experience. Both Ryan and Todd are excellent instructors, and the owner is there to run things everyday. Great operation. Look forward to renting a board from them again and another lesson.<//Text>

I have done surfing several times before, but i wanted both my cousins who are 11 to try it too! It was amazing that from the very firsts lesson with Nofar, they both managed to stand up on their surf boards and ride a wave until the shore. Moreover, they both loved it so much that we returned two days later. Nofar is such a gentle and kind spirit who was so understanding! We were stuck on the highway in a traffic jam and contacted her that we will be late 30 mins. She told us she is waiting for us, and moreover, she extended our surfing time. She is so kind and such a good teacher. Her technique was suitable for our whole family! We cant wait to come back!</text>

The guys are very cool and friendly! I had no experience in surfing whatsoever and in the very first lesson I could ride smoothly the (small) waves. I was planning to go to the other beaches around but my first surfing experience was so fun so I decided to stay here and do so more. You should try it!<//review>

Highly recommend Katowice surf lessons! My son had the best time learning surf with Colston. He was very nice and patient. He kept encouraging my son that he was doing a good job, which made my son more and more confident and learned better and better. Thank colston and Katowice very much.<//Review>

I don't usually spend this much for sport, but I decided to have a surf lesson with the Kapowui crew my last day in LA.
Even if it was my first time on a surfboard my instructor Clay helped me a lot and in the end I managed to hop up on quite a good number of waves!
Really recommended!< /Review>

Kapowui what to say, it was just amazing. I took my first lesson with Nick, and he totally guided me at the begining to the end, it was so cool, he gave the best advise for beginner, and also help me a lot to start, surfing wasn't so tough with him haha, i had just such a great time, it was 100% of fun. You are in the perfect hands with Nick and with Kapowui !! GO<//review>

First time surfers, had a blast!  We were lucky enough to get Jeremie as an instructor, he was friendly, experienced, chill and has great teaching technique.  I really appreciated his no-nonsense instruction:  we were out on the water quicker than I anticipated and our 2-hour (2-people) lesson was non-stop fun!!  I didn't think I would get up in the first hour, but was standing up on my second wave!  The instruction and lesson  felt safe, which added to confidence and thus made for a great time with no stress.   I know that people may hesitate on the price (all the surf schools are about the same cost, btw) but when you think a night out with a bottle of wine and a really nice meal costs about the same.  This was a great deal more fun and we will certainly remember it much longer than a meal out, so dollars well spent!  We felt so good afterwards and spent the rest of the afternoon walking around Venice and back to the Pier.  I would recommend Kapowui for a spectacular experience to anyone.  Travel tip:  take the Expo Train out to Santa Monica and walk down Ocean Front.  It wasn't much longer than driving from downtown LA (45 minutes) and saves $$ for parking as well as the environment :)< /text>

More times than I'd like to admit, I've received service from people with a ton of personality, only to realize they became too comfortable, taking liberties with the way they treated my business. Ex: The tailor you hit it off with, but starts delaying your alterations because he confused your kindness with his cousin's.

It's a shame when you find people with genuine personalities that fail at what you came to see them for.

Jeremie and Martin at Kapowui are able to balance professionalism and great personalities.

If you want to learn how to surf and feel like writing a five star review after you're done, this is the place.</text>

<Review>Really, truly simply, the best possible lesson I could have imagined. They not only effortlessly teach you the technicals, they convey in every possible way what one must do physically and mentally and dare I say spiritually to get up on a wave. And get up you definitely will. They teach you to let go and let it happen and that is 80% of the battle. Brilliant experience.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I had two lessons in this school. In the first time, I was taught by a tutor (I can't remember his name) , together with another two girls. The tutor didn't teach me very well. However, my second tutor (his name is Will Ermish) was so so so good. He was very patient and nice. That's why I had big progress in that lesson. I stood up on the board many times. I think I will definitely do more lessons in Kapowui this summer.<//Text>
<pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1495364839436, 'text': "Sonya, thank you for taking the time to write us a review! When I first read your review I got so upset to hear about your 1st lesson last year. I only hire the best instructors and train them extensively to be even better. I had to get to the bottom of why you didn't learn much your 1st lesson.I looked through my records to see who did your 1st lesson. His name is Raymond. He is a very good instructors so It didn't make sence.  I did further research to check the condition during your 1st lesson on July 3rd 2016 and that's when I discovered the problem. The surf was HUGE your 1st lesson. When the surf is big it is always going to be much more challenging for the student and the instructor. I take  full responsibility for you not learning much your 1st lesson because I drill it into the instructors head,when the conditions are challenging, the instructors #1 job is to keep the student safe. So I  apologize that you didn't learn much.  Here is a cut and paste of the conditions Last summer\n\nPOSTED: 07/02/16, 8:08 AM PDT\nLOS ANGELES >> Elevated surf and strong rip currents are expected Monday along the coast, creating hazards for swimmers, surfers and boaters on this Independence Day, National Weather Service forecasters said.\n\nSurf of 3 to 5 feet is expected, reaching 7 feet at some south- and southwest-facing beaches, and a beach hazards statement, which is one level less serious than a high surf advisory, will be in effect in Los Angeles County through Monday afternoon and in Orange County through Monday night.\n\nI believe the conditions where the problem with your 1st lesson more so than the instructor. Thank you for giving  us a second chance to redeem your confidence.  I truly appreciate your repeat business and I'm happy you had a good time at your 2nd lesson and plan on coming back. Thank you again,  Martin"}</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9< /Gmap_id></record>

Best place to rent a board and a wetsuit even at 6am in the morning! Martin the owner is a super nice guy. Just give him a call the day before to see if he's out the next morning. Super friendly and uncomplicated! Will definitely come back next time I'm here.<//Review>

Totally rude and unprofessional! Would never recommend this company or surf guys. Wouldn’t answer any questions about surfboard rentals, where to find them, how much, etc. said they don’t know wave conditions or surf info and just to show up to find out rental info. Showed up within the hours he quoted only to find out they closed early and left. Major dbag!</Text>

{'time': 1570383976672, 'text': "So I'm rude and unprofessional because I didn't give you the answers you were looking for? Perhaps you are  a lazy, entitled and assumptive millennial. We are very busy EVERY day, and it so happens when you called I was extremely busy (I had 2 calls on hold and I was getting multiple groups ready for their surf lessons). So when I get calls asking for information that can be found on our website, I tell people to refer to it. All the information you wanted ( prices, location, surf conditions, etc.) could be found on my website with a modicum of effort. So you assume since it's Sunday and you are not busy or working that no one else is or that your wants must be accommodated, wrong. Also Surf conditions are constantly changing and are subject to the surfers ability. So any information I may have given you would be subject to change and dependent upon your skill level.  And as I stated before I was super busy and  i didn't have time to ask the 10 questions it would have taken to get the answers from you  that I would have needed to steer you in the right direction. And I've found after 14 years in business 99.9% of the people over estimate there ability, so it's usually a waste of time to ask the questions in the 1st place. Furthermore, I was working full speed from 5am to 10am so I didn't have time to check the conditions myself all morning, so I didn't have the answer to that question and I wasn't going to lie to you just to get you to come in and do a rental. You never asked for the hours over the phone, that's a lie!, and negates everything you said as far as I'm concerned. And exactly why did you come to my surf school wanting to give me your business, if I was that rude to you over the phone? There are literally a 100 other places to rent from. I would never make any effort to give my hard earned money or business to a rude, unprofessional, Dbag. Looking for a fight I assume. So when you showed up and I told you we were closing in 3 hours. That's because our primary business is surf lessons not rentals, and this is the Fall/ October, so we don't stay at the beach all day like we do during the summer.  Had you asked over the phone I would have told you we were closing early to save you the trip or had you asked  I could have referred you to another place that specializes in rentals. We are not a corporate franchise that has set hours, we are a family business that is open when we have lessons or enough rentals to cover our overhead. Your request for a 4 hour rental would cost me money to stay open due to my overhead. The hours on my google maps are subject to change daily and is determined by our surf lesson schedule. The 6am-6pm is our availability for calls, not rentals or lessons. However, there is no way to delineate this on google maps. So now you know. And now, just as you were, I'm going to be assumptive, but I'm a very good judge of charterer, so here goes.  I still remember your face when came to the van in a huff looking for a problem, I knew something was off (I think you already had this review written and you came looking for any reason to post it, because 10 seconds after you left, I got a notification of the review). When you showed up, you didn't say we had spoken to on the phone. You are young, tall, muscular, very handsome dude and I'm sure everything comes easy for you, maybe that's why you feel entitled. However you need to realize the world doesn't owe you what you want, (even something as simple as answers to your questions) usually you have to work for it, so stop crying when you don't get it. Perhaps in the future you can think out side your feelings and instead of wasting energy writing bad reviews, you can use your time to do a google search and find the 2 other surf shops 50 feet next to me, walk over to them, rent, and have a fun day surfing, but nooo, it's more important to let people know you weren't treated special. Have I now answered all of your questions?\nHave a life, Major Dbag."}<//resp>

He made it easy to learn the technique and basics. I was able to catch my first wave 10 minutes after getting in the water. I'll certainly come back for more lessons. The instructors are professional and highly knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend this place if anyone wants to give surfing a try.</review>< GmapID>

If you're reading this review trying to figure out where to book your surf lesson - save yourself some time and just book with Kapowui. I've taken both group and private lessons with Jeremie and Leon....both were out of this world. Kapowui is a business that reminds me of the good in the world.</Review>

He gave me critique and tips after every wave i caught (or didn’t) so i could learn from my mistakes. And he also gave me compliments and was very excited when i did catch a wave.

But since we can't control mother nature, we work with it, and you were an absolute rock star during some real tough conditions!!! My hat is off to you for being such a trooper.

After 2 hours (1.5 in the water) I'm knackered but delighted with the experience from Kapowui (super helpful on the phone and a smooth booking experience)  and the lesson I got from Will. If I'm back next year I'm going back there! Thanks guys!<//Review>< pics>

<text>My wife and I had a great lesson with Will.  He suggested a better time when we made our appointment due to the upcoming conditions and he was spot on.  He spent time with us on shore before we got in the water and we were both able to get up on a few waves after just a few tries.

Great outfit. Juan took our family of 4 first-timers out for 1.5 hours and we had a great time. I'm not the most comfortable in the water, but they were so encouraging and instructive that I felt at ease and learned a lot. We would for sure go back. Kapowui will be our go-to when in Venice Beach.</Review>

Our 2 hour surf lesson was the highlight of the trip! The 4 of us went in with zero surf experience but our instructor Jeremie was amazing and got everyone up on their boards. Jeremie was tons of fun, professional, and really encouraging. The rest of the team we met or had contact with were friendly and professional. Would highly reccomend. We would have booked a second lesson if we weren't leaving the next day. Huge thank you to Jeremie and the Kapowui team!!<//review>

Absolutely stellar. I had never so much as stood on a surfboard before, and I was skeptical about whether I would dig it. One 2 hour lesson with Lulu, and I was not only standing up, but catching loads of waves! These people not only know what they are doing, but they are passionate about it. Everyone here I talked to was super cool, and extremely encouraging to  a total newcomer. It's been only 4 days since my lesson here, and I'm already hustling to buy a board and a wetsuit. I am officially a surfing acolyte now, largely thanks to Kapowui, and especially Lulu. Big shoutout to you Lulu!!

I will be referring every visiting friend with a dream to surf to Kapowui. The end.</Text>

{'time': 1498690854938, 'text': 'Christopher, this is the type of review that reminds us we are the living the dream. Nothing is better for us than the knowledge that we are inspiring others to live the search and chase the waves. We all live, eat, breath, and dream of surfing, so to know we have one more kindred spirit in the water is AWESOME!!! Take care and welcome to a new way of life and your new family. Martin P.S. Thank you for the amazing review!'}< /Resp>

<Review>Ive taken lessons at vacation spots but my lesson at home in venice with carl of kapowui was the best surf experience ive ever had. Marty and carl didnt just help me have a great session, but they provided me with the information to continue to learn and progress on my own. With their input i now know what kind of board i want to buy and have a plan to get more experience. I have no doubt ill be checking back in for another lesson after ive done some more practicing. I strongly recommend signing up for a great surf lesson.</Review>< gmap_id>

My girlfriend and I decided to take lessons and we went with Kapowui because of all the good reviews and I'm glad I made the decision. We were able to learn the basics of surfing within an hour and a half. The owner was super nice and our instructor Raymond was patient and engaged with our learning. Great group of guys at Kapowui 👍🏻👍🏻</Review>

If you are looking for the BEST instructor and surf lessons you need to request Jonny at Kapowui ! My daughter had a 2 hour lesson today and it was a GREAT experience and the highlight of our trip to LA.  She had never surfed before and he had her up right from the start of the lesson and surfing all the way into shore. If we were in town longer we would have definitely signed up for more lessons. His positive energy and enthusiasm is contagious. THANK YOU JONNY!!!!!!</Review>

We had Juan who is a great teacher. And after that, you can rent material from them. Which we will do. Just go and book already. Come with your good vibes and all will be just fun and good times.< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< user_id>

Was in Venice on holiday and saw there cool VW can and decided to swing by and take a lesson (never surfed before). They were all very friendly and I was given a time directly with an instructor named Corry. He had me up and surfing the waves within half an hour. An absolute legend!!! Can't recommend this company enough and Corry! However the other instructors seem awesome as well seriously knowledgeable and friendly.  I ended up booking 3 more lessons with Corry and would have done more if it wasn't for the fact that I'm going home. Booking a trip here next year for surfing!< /Text>

They say you find a way to make a living doing what you love. If this is not a manifestation of that very ideal, I don't know what is. I genuinely forgot that any part of this experience was a business transaction (we literally could recall if we had paid by the end of the session). My husband and my son were first time surfers and the team really cared about that. Their demonstrated awareness of conditions, assertiveness of their clients and overall enthusiasm has made us lifelong members.

Learning to surf with Mike was like sharing life experience with a cousin you had not seen since childhood. The entire staff made us feel like family. I don't think that I could put a fair price on the experience that Mike and the rest of the Kapowui staff gave us as first time surfers. I may even venture to say that we made new friends. There is a valid reason for this company to have achieved five stars across the board...it is a rarity.

Mike, thanks for going the extra mile to warm our little munchkin up to the water. You are an awesome person, instructor and surfer...

First time surfing was absolutely amazing thanks to our instructor juan who made sure it was a fun, safe & adventurous experience.  Owner Marty was very hands on, down to earth and took the time to answer all questions.< /Review>

I never write reviews, but felt compelled to do so for this one. I had two 1.5hr private lessons with Corey who was awesome. As this was my first time surfing he really taught me the basics of surfing and ocean craft, enabling me to be really comfortable surfing by myself. Without a doubt 5*. Thanks again!</Text>

This was definitely one of the highlights on our trip! I've always wanted to learn how to surf and we really choosed the perfect company for our first surf lesson. Our instructor and the other we met from the team were super kind and very professional! I'm so excited to learn more about surfing and when I return to Venice I will absolutely go back to Kapowui to take some more lessons. I really recommend them to everyone, they were really dedicated and you will have the best time!</Text>

5 stars, hands down! I've lived in LA for 10+ years and never learned to surf because I was afraid of the water and didn't know what I was doing. Kapowui surf school came through!! Martin was super accommodating to my friend and I. We booked at the last minute and added my friend on the same day. Communication around the lesson was great as was the instruction itself. Juan was our instructor - not only was he helpful and knowledgeable but he's suuuper fun! He'll make you laugh while working with you on your technique. He helped us feel comfortable in water and after spending a couple hours with him, you can't help but feel a nice bond to the strong guy with the big heart who keeps you safe in the water and guarantees you'd catch a wave or two. Cheers to the best surfing school in LA - these guys are spectacular.< /review>

This is possibly the best surf school in Venice Beach! A place with great vibes and lots of smiles. The instructors are one big and tightly knit family with many years of surf experience. There is an instructor that fits any learning style and personality. My instructor Eduwardo was the best!  He is the most kind, patient, and thorough; it was my first lesson ever and I felt very safe and assured at all times. The pricing is fair and everything is practically included; just bring a towel and your game. Kapowui's mission is to spread the passion for surfing as well as having a great time.</review>

After having many surfing lessons, this was by far the best. Their method of explaining how to surf allowed everyone to surf to shore. Great Experience!</review>

Highly recommended for beginners! Will is a great instructor, making you feel comfortable during the entire lesson and making sure you have fun while you do it. I started surfing within 15 minutes of the lesson so if I can do it, anyone can. Thanks Will and team for a great lesson!</text>

Had a brilliant first ever surf lesson with Todd.  An hour and a half flew by and Todd was patient and encouraging.
Perfect day after Halloween hangover cure. Really hoping I can go out again before going back to the U.K.!< /review>

Wow! What an experience! I was scared of wave but Clay was really patient with me. Also the owner of the business (didn't catch his name) came by and tried to make this experience enjoyable for me. No wonder this place has 5 start rating. I would go on and on about how great these guys are but lots other people did that already and they are true. Even though i got defeated by waves, I would love to go back and try again. Price is really good as well; all the gears and the work instructors put in and the experience, worth it. Do it.</Text>

<review>If I could give these guys more than 5 stars I would!  I took a lesson here while visiting LA last week and cannot recommend them enough.  They were helpful when I texted them with questions ahead of time (on thanksgiving even!).
This review is going to be long, because I have so many good things to say!
The instructors we met were very friendly and welcoming as we got set up.  Raymond did our lesson, and explained everything clearly and gave us tips and pointers on our form before we even got into the water.  Once we started surfing he set us up for each wave, making sure our timing and speed was right so we could focus on popping up and balancing properly.  He gave us feedback on every wave, and both of us (first time surfers) were able to catch several waves by the end of the lesson.  We could see other lessons from Kapowui happening around us, and it seemed like the other lessons were equally successful. I have heard friends and family try other surfing schools who have given up after fruitless classes, and Kapowui made our experience completely the opposite.
We enjoyed the lesson so much that we went back to rent equipment from them a few days later.  Martin the owner was incredibly helpful; when we weren't sure if we should rent or take another lesson, he suggested we rent and if we changed our minds he would count our rental fee towards the lesson.  Martin was out surfing while we were, and gave us a bunch of pointers even though he had no obligation to.  It is clear he and all the Kapowui instructors are so passionate about surfing and teaching, and the joy they bring to it changes the lives of everyone who passes through.
You have converted two new surfers Kapowui! We are already planning our next trip back to venice to surf with you guys.  Thank you so much for sharing your passion!</review></record></dataset><record>

I took my first surf lesson with Jay on 2/16/2017. He was a really cool laid back instructor who got me up on my first try. I would highly recommend Kapowui Surf Lessons to anyone visiting the area that wants to learn how to surf. Awesome experience!< /Review>

The staff is awesome and very flexible, their van is parked just a few meters from the ocean in Venice with very nice waves around :)
They also gave us perfect advices about the surf conditions!
Once back in Venice I will definitively come back !!<//Review><Time>1521494919350</Time>< Pictures>

We had the best time at this surf school! My husband and I decided to try out surfing for the very first time, and it was truly the highlight of our summer! Big Thanks to Leon Egen our awesome instructor for being so positive and patient with us during our time there as well as the rest of the kapowui crew for being so accommodating.

We are very sad to leave but will surely be back soon!</review>

<review>Got up on the board within the first hour!!

Unbelievable. My ten year old son and I  (I am 45 year old woman) took surf lessons from Jeremie yesterday- neither of us have ever been on a board at all!

I can’t tell you how Fun it was and how surprised we were that we could actually do it!!

All thanks to Jeremie- he was kind, patient, he made us laugh and relax.

Do it. Take lessons. It’s great fun!!</review>< user_name>

My girlfriend and me were on a USA Roadtrip this Summer. On this trip we wanted to take our very first surf lesson, but we didn't manage to make reservations beforehand. So we thought this dream had to die.
But right before we left LA, we spontaneously stopped by at Kapowui Surf Lessons and although they were all booked out, they somehow made it possible for us to get our private lessons - instantly. This saved our day!
The instructor was very nice and really took his time explaining everything we needed to know. The lesson was very well structured and fun.
Even though it was my first time on a surfboard I managed to stand up on the board and ride the waves without falling down a couple times.
I don't remember the price, but I remember it to be very fair!
Definetely one of our trip's Highlights!<//text>

there is a reason why there are so many 5 star ratings for this surf club.  you don't have to know A THING about surfing and you will be treated not only as an equal but with the utmost respect.  in addition, you WILL be surfing by the end of your lesson.  the change in people's energies after they come back from a lesson is moving, not to get sappy, but it's like nothing i've ever seen.  do yourself a favor.  OH and if you can find others to do a group lesson with you the rate decreases with each additional guest so there's that too!< /Review>

Unlike many other companies that make you feel like a burden when you first show up, the staff at kapowui were welcoming and extremely friendly. Despite our lesson being on Memorial Day, we got our own personal lesson with Blake, who was awesome. The experience was great, we had a really good time and certainly recommend Kapowui for surf lessons.</Review><time>1496158142436</time>< response>

Kapowui and our instructor, Jaun were excellent! We certainly recommend! The whole team was friendly, fun, and gave off good vibes. Resvervations were easy. Surfing instructions were clear. Safety was a priority. And best part was we actually got up and surfed!<//review>

Yeah, Todd has been with kapowui for years and is one of our best instructors. Todd will be super stoked when he reads your review. All the instructors care so much about Kapowui, this business is the common bond and gives all of us misfits a purpose in additions to a surrogate family. And we are all determined to make it the best we can, one lesson at a time. Plus reviews, mentioning a specific instructor, gives them bragging rights for the day and they get to be King or Queen for the day. Once again Thank you. Martin"}< /Resp>

If you want to start something new start surfing at Kapowui, amazing! My experience at kapowui surf school was incredible, the surf instructors were supportive, kind and all around amazing people, especially Leon our instructor. I had improved hugely by the end of my 2 hour lesson and of course had to go back to improve even further. I highly recommend kapowui especially if you have not surfed before.</review>

< Review>
Had my very first surf lesson here, with Jonny and it has been phenomenal. All the guys are very nice and make you feel welcome. Had so much fun in the waves. Jonny taught me some of the basics for 10 min. on the beach but the rest was learning by doing. I never felt unsafe or uncomfortable. Jonny did a great job letting me learn by myself but always helping me out in the important moments. I will definately go again to learn some more.< /Review>

My surflesson with Jonny was an amazing experience. It was my first time surfing and thanks to him I was able to get up on the board pretty quick and catch lots of waves.
Everyone was welcoming and friendly. Highly recommend surfing at Kapowuis.</Text>

<text>Took a trip to Venice Beach and at last minute my twelve year old daughter decided to surf. Korrey gave her a 20 minute class and within a short time my daughter was surfing up on a board. He definitely knows his stuff!!!!  (Korrey was a pro surfer and it definitely showed as my daughter had never surfed).< /text>< user_name>

This is perfect for beginners , intermediate & anyone who wants a great time surfing !!!!<//text>

I've taken several surfing classes before and I still learned so much from Martin - the dynamics of the board, a new way to do the pop-up etc. He and his team are really lovely guys, would definitely recommend to anyone!<//text>

<text>I met one of the surf instructors, Will Ermish, while in Bali earlier this month. He offered to give me a lesson which I was thrilled about. I wasn't nervous at all because I knew how knowledgable Will was and he made me feel incredibely comfortable and at ease. He was so informative and really really knows what he is doing. Plus he is so friendly, funny, wise and just all around a great guy to be around. He made me fall in love with surfing and by far was one of the best days in Bali I've had. Wish I lived in Venice so I could keep getting lessons from him, but I left that one session with the skills to know I'd be able to go out and try it on my own :)</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I had an amazing time on the water. As first time surfers in choppy water, me, my mom, and my sister were still able to get up with the help of our instructor and learn surfing fundamentals.</review>

The Quick Summary:  I walked away feeling so damn happy and successful. If you are showing up as a student, you're going to walk away feeling like a true surfer.

My Experience:  This team was so happy and approachable. My instructor (also named Will) really went into a lot of detail with me and had positive patience and laugh-tastic encouragement. Via his help I check off one bucket list item several times. That's freak'n rad!  Seek your wave breaks with these guys. And while I'm sure the whole team has this perk: if YOU have fear or concern about surfing, seek out the Instructor Will. He'll effortlessly give you the courage and support you need.< /review>

< Review>
These guys are great!! Everyone we interacted with had the best energy possible. Our instructor, Will, was particularly awesome. He brought the right vibe entirely and also gave great instruction, despite tough conditions for a couple of beginners. He dealt incredibly well with the varying level of experience between me and my girlfriend and helped her catch her first waves ever! Will helped her conquer her fears and made sure she was as comfortable as possible. The whole thing ended with some major smiles, rad photos, and great memories. Plus, I now can cross off the last item on my list of making sure Ali (gf) is a badass of a keeper... catching a couple rides on the first time out... shoooot!!  I recommend these guys to anyone and everyone. Thanks, Kapowui team!</Review>

I had sooo much fun this morning with Will!!! It was my first time surfing in my entire life, he was soo patient with me even though I kept on falling off the board, he continuously brought soo much energy and positivity with such clear communication on how to correct my form so I could stay upright on the board, and ultimately be able to ride the waves all the way to the end with comfort and confidence, which I did!!! Thanks to Will of course! I couldn't of been any happier with my experience from this morning!!! To anyone out there who wants to try out surfing but is intimidated that they will not be able to get the hang of it right away or not enjoy their surf lesson then you definitely need to check this place out! I promise you won't be disappointed, you'll have soo much fun, you'll love the environment, the clear communication from the instructors, how patient they are, the tremendous amount of positivity and energy they bring, and most importantly you'll definitely be able to learn how to surf if you continue having surf lessons with them! I can't wait until my next lesson! These guys are awesome!!!</review>

<Text>Phenomenal group of instructors.
Me and my gal pal came to LA with intentions of only staying 5 days , then the plan was to go to Vegas for the remaining 5 days.
Long story short, we had our first lesson day 2 and by day 3 we had cancelled Vegas,  extended our stay in Venice beach,bought a package surfing  deal each so we could surf once a day everyday until it was time to head back.
My friend was a natural and was able to pop up on the board day 1.
Me , not so much. I kept trying and kept falling right into the water. Our first instructor Leon (who we had 4 sessions with) then made the observation that  i overshoot when I put my foot up when getting on the board.  I was too far up on the board when I popped up. So he said I'd need to be far back on the board ,more so than others since I have that habit of putting my leg to far forward. And whatddya know, suddenly I was balacing on that board! Amazing correction.
Our 2nd instructor Tod (we wanted to try as many instructors as possible to see what we could take from each one as everyone has their own style and methods) gave me the awesome advice to pop up on the board a bit faster and use my hands to balancs once im up so I'd stay on longer. Amazing feedback as that improved my balance greatly.
Will gave us gorgeous  waves and his ability to time them so they wouldn't be too overwhelming for us was impressive especially since the waves were massive when we went out for our lesson with him. He especially helped me with my fear of getting back into the water with my board which is honestly terrifying to me as I often felt like between the wind, water and sand (that would cement me in the ground) I felt I had little control over my board when getting back into the safe zone past the breaking waves.
I should say that every instructor addressed this fear with me and showed me how to get inside but I felt like I was able to spend more time making sure it stuck with Will in particular.

From day one till my last surfing session today (until I come back next month) myprogress is amazing and a true testament to how great these guys are at their jobs.
And as for my friend,  she's a natural....but can't swim very well. And they had her feeling so brave and taught her exactly how to protect herself in the water - this is a big deal for a girl who is scared of the water.

If you want to learn surfing , this is the group of people to go to. They're super fun, genuinely good people and VERY knowledgeable and skilled in their field.
They will take great care of you.
Thank you for everything guys, see you in September ❤ x</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9</gmapID></record>

<gmapID>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9<//gmapID><Time>1490407156021< /Time><Pics>None< /Pics><review>We were on an 8-day, 1700 mile whirlwind tour of California/Nevada last week with the family, when we were walking along Venice Beach in the morning before taking off for San Francisco. I was taking a picture of this very cool VW van with surfboards on it, when a guy came over and suggested we take surfing lessons. It put the spark in my partners mind, but i was a little more reserved.  It would completely round out the trip which included skiing in Heavenly, Lake Tahoe, hot springs in the Sierras, Death Valley and the High Roller in Vegas.  But, we didn't have a lot of time before heading to Alcatraz.

The guy, Blake, said he wouldn't be able to take us until later, because the tide was high, but to think about it and let him know if we were interested. We walked a bit, and the surf seemed huge! I never surfed before, and being from Nova Scotia, the waves seemed ginormous.

I was also a little unsure about a surfing outfit running out of a VW van on the beach. Seemed straight out of a novel or a movie. A bit unreal. Were there better options out there? So i took a minute to look through some reviews. Everything seemed good. Lots of great reviews for them, so i said why not?

Blake couldn't take us right away and we couldn't wait much longer because we had to get on the road, so one of the owner's, Marty came in special for us.  As a business owner, that in itself tells me that he's conscientious. And the equipment was clean and in great condition. The wetsuits were even on the top of the van warming up for us.

Then there was the dryland training. They made sure all of our group were ready for the water before we went out. Super safety conscious. Both of them were so positive and experienced that i felt totally safe. The waves were big, but they kept us all sorted out and motivated.  i even got up 5 times!!!

I really can't say enough about Kapowui. If i could give 10 stars out of 5, i would.  It's the real deal. If you are looking for an authentic surf experience at Venice Beach, Marty will give it to you. I'm so glad i took the plunge. It was the highlight of an already pretty epic adventure. Worth every penny!<//review></record>

Super teacher, always positive, patient and educationalist, Thierry was able to reassure me and encourage me for this initiation to surfing!
A little (very) stressed, he answered all my questions with kindness and kindness, well before the course.
Obviously, we do not surf alone after the first lesson ^^ but it allows you to start to feel the glide and the pleasure it can provide
In summary, go ahead with your eyes closed, I loved this initiation so much that it convinced me to do a longer internship to really learn to surf :)

(Original)
Merci à Kapowui et un ENORME MERCI à Thierry!
Super prof, toujours positif, patient et pédagogue, Thierry a su me rassurer et m'encourager pour cette initiation au surf !
Un peu (très) stressée, il a répondu à toutes mes questions avec bienveillance et gentillesse et ce, bien avant le cours.
Evidemment, on ne surfe pas tout seul au bout de la première leçon ^^ mais elle permet de commencer à sentir la glisse et le plaisir que cela peut procurer
En résumé, allez-y les yeux fermés, j'ai tellement adoré cette initiation que ça m'a convaincu de faire un stage plus long pour vraiment apprendre à surfer :)</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

a little more expensive but definitely the price.
I myself took a private lesson and got along very well with my surf instructor.
I can only recommend it

<user_id>106984133674259659480< /user_id><rating>5</rating><review>(Translated by Google) We loved our first experience surfing ... we were there early ... the top, no bathers to interfere with our first learning ... we were a little afraid of the cold water at first but the school we ready a wet suit. So it was perfect ... a great activity to do especially with teens who are just waiting to live new adventures. Special thanks to Will, our teacher, for his patience and kindness ... great organization. Congratulations and thank you again for this great time.

Nous avons adoré notre première expérience en surf...nous y étions tôt...le top, pas de baigneurs pour gêner nos premiers apprentissages...on a eu un peu peur de l’eau froide au début mais l’école nous prête un wet suit. C’était donc parfait...une super activité à faire surtout avec des ados qui ne demandent qu’à vivre de nouvelles aventures. merci spécial à Will, notre prof, pour sa patience et sa gentillesse...super organisation. Bravo et encore merci pour ce super moment.< /review><resp>None</resp><user_name>chantal umbriaco< /user_name>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>(Translated by Google) Perfect introduction to the art of SURFING. Our instructor Todd was great. He had a lot of patience and made you feel safe and good. He managed to get us safely onto the board within 1.5 hours - standing;)
So if you are going to Venice and want to learn to surf, you should register here. The contact was totally easy and reliable! Have fun.

(Original)
Perfekter Einstieg in die Kunst des SURFENS. Unser Instructor Todd war grossartig. Er hatte viel Geduld und hat einem ein sicheres und gutes Gefühl gegeben. Er hat es geschafft uns innerhalb von 1,5 h sicher auf das Brett zubekommen - stehend ;)
Also wer nach Venice fährt und Lust hat surfen zu lernen sollte sich hier melden. Der Kontakt war total easy und zuverlässig! Viel Spass.<//text>< Pictures>

{'time': 1527365301951, 'text': "Forest, this is Martin with kapowui,  I saw your 2 star review on Google,  can you tell me what the problem was? When I talked to you and your wife after your lesson you seemed happy with the lesson. I'm hoping that it was just a mistake when you left us a review. I want everyone to have a great time and your experience is very important to us and if you didn't have a good time I would like to know how what you thought the problem was so I can address it with your instructor and if I could possibly do something to make it right for you.We are a small company and our reviews are very important for us and affect our business tremendously.  Todd, your instructor thought your experience was good. He sent this to me to send you ,\n\nHi Forest, So I noticed the 2 star review and I'm truly sorry that you weren't happy. What could I have done to have made it better? Is there anything that you think I did wrong? Please let me know. I realize it was in tough conditions that' why I gave you a extra 30 minutes and  I tried my hardest to make it fun with the conditions I had to work with. If you truly feel I did a poor job then I would like to return the $30 tip you gave me because I must not have deserved it. I hope you get this soon and I hope to hear from you soon as well. Send me your Venmo or paypal address and I will send you your tip back. And If you would like to do another lesson in the future I would love to do it and make up for  whatever you think I did wrong.  Thank you.\n\n-Todd"}</Resp>

<resp>{'time': 1550450814199, 'text': "Dear Luke, This is a fake review or you have left this review for wrong company. Very odd, 99.9 % of the time anyone who has a bad experience they leaves details about their experiences in the review or have verbally let me know. We haven't done a lesson with a Luke since summer 7 months ago, from my experience no one leaves a review more than a week or two after their lessons,  usually a day or two. I've been in business 13 years so I'm very aware of how people leave reviews. In 13 years the very very few people who have had a lesson that didn't meet their expectation , 99% of those people let their instructor know immediately. No one has complained about a lesson with us in a long time and this is the peak of winter and we aren't doing many lessons at this time. Also very odd that I have updated my response to your review several times because it bothers me and I know google sends you a copy of my reply yet you haven't responded, which proves to me this is a BS fake review.  If this is a real review please contact me and let me know what your issue was and we can discuss it and I will find a solution or help you understand why your expectations were not met. until then I will think you are full of sxxt.   However I also see you live in Ohio and it's the middle of winter and freezing there now with the polar vortex (mid February). I also see how you have left nine- 1 or 2 star reviews in the last couple of hours, all for places in Ohio. I've taken screenshots on my computer just in case you change them. I've dealt with fake reviews before so I know how to combat against them no.  So tell me, how did you get to LA and back so quick? I personally think you are having a bad day and/ or you are bored and want to make other people suffer like you are, so you are leaving random reviews. To let you know reviews are very serious for any company and I especially take all reviews very serious, however I can not take your serious because I also see that out of the 70 reviews you have left 80% are 1 or 2 stars, and I also see your review history and it doesn't add up. However I could be wrong,And for any potential lessons reading this, the only reason your explanation would not be met would be due to conditions which are out of our control and we always warn our clients about and try to reschedule.  I personally don't think you ever leave Ohio, I think you are one of those people who wished they traveled and are bitter that you do not, and you so you travel online and then leave reviews for companies you wish you could go to. Prove me wrong and post a picture of you at my company. Everyone takes a picture of their lesson because we have the coolest set up in LA. If you did a lesson with us. So  post a picture, a screenshot of your booking,  or a screenshot of you phone history showing you were at my business and I will give you a sincere apology,  a back rub and and dinner, otherwise I will assume this is a fake lesson.  And if this is a fake review from a loser,  try to start enjoying life, stop being a bitter loser, and hurting other people. I know you don't think so by reading all of your other reviews but life is awesome get outside and go have a snowball fight with some kids. If you are lonely and depressed and need someone to talk to give me a call, i'll cheer you up!!!!!!.  Martin    I wish I could feel pity for you but I can't since you have attacked my company/ me for no reason."}</resp><gmapID>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9<//gmapID></record>
