First off, I love this place! Andrew did my two largest pieces and they are amazing! I also took my bf and he got his first tattoo here! I am definitely itching for a new pieces. I highly recommend!</Review>

This is my first time getting tattoo ever and I chose this place because my friend brought me here. I was a little nervous but the environment was super chill and I felt relaxed. The artist was really easy to work with and I'm satisfied with my first tattoo ever.< /text>

while I was there, a "lady" of the night came in and asked Joey how much it would cost to have him tattoo the word "Octopussy" down his/her back. That alone made my whole night complete! Go for the scenery!</text>

I had a misunderstanding the 2nd time I visited the shop; but they showed me they care and to me, that's way more important than a misunderstanding. Thank you, I'll definitely want my next tattoo at your place :)</review>

< Review>
I was visiting LA and looked around for a tattoo shop and saw that RicRoks tattoo had great reviews. I walked in 30 minutes before closing due to traffic and Andrew was willing to do my tattoo. Andrew was patient, kind and willing to stay without a complaint. Andrew did an amazing job and had a light hand. I reccomend this place to anyone! My tattoo looks better than what I can imagine and I was so glad I got an artist that was so personable.</Review>

Got my very first tattoo here a month ago & my 2nd yesterday. I had a very great experience on my 2 visits here. Interior is clean & needles & tattoo areas are sterile. My artist was Sean Smith, super nice & cool guy & will make you feel as comfortable as possible. He's very open about your ideas & he's nice enough to share his own as well. I love his work and will come back for my 3rd, soon. Thanks Sean!</Review>

<text>We only came in to browse, but the staff were super-friendly and helpful.  I looked through their portfolio books while my friend asked the artists questions - there weren't any other customers, so we just hung out for a while. The shop was clean, didn't see any work being done so I can't comment on that, but we did appreciate their time.< /text>< Date>

Got my first tattoo here a few months back from the top dog himself. He's a great man and his other artists are great people too. The shop is full of really cool drawing and pictures so it's an eye candy while you're waiting. Although I payed a lot for my tattoo, I would still come here again for my next one. Would recommend.< /review>

The place has a great-relaxed atmosphere, I love the decor and it is also always very clean. You can tell they love what they do; the attention and customer service are the best in the area.< /Review>< Pics>

<Response>None<//Response><Text>I was told on Monday to come in on Friday at 3pm and they would have an opening to see me. I get there at 3 and am told the tattoo artist was going to start a tattoo on someone else, but if I want to wait an hour  and half then he can see me. No thanks. Why would I want someplace to permanently mark me up when they can keep simple appointments.< /Text><UserId.>107743123426885409936<//UserId.>< gmap_id>

I went in a few months ago for a semi colon tattoo on my shoulder (very little). Raul was the person who did it, he was very nice and gave me his number to text him a pic for his IG. The tattoo looked very old!! He told me to give it time and I did but only got worse as if I've had it for years the semi colon is not even fully shaded in as it should be and mind you I was very careful after I got it done. I texted him after the two weeks and asked if he can fix it as he said he would. When I asked him if I can come in during the weekend he left me on read.

< Review>
This barbershop is by far one of the best retreats around, professional in every aspect but friendly too. The hairstylist and her dedicated team will do their best to meet your needs and give you your ultimate treatment. Massages are a must and worth every penny. Highly worth a visit!<//Review>

I always have a great experience at Chad's. The prices are great! Chad, Stephanie and Olga are super professional and skilled. I love all of the collectibles to peruse, the old school barber chairs that Chad just had refurbished, and of course, the great hair I walk out with every time!<//Text>

<Text>The barbers are all great and talented and it is a safe place to get your haircut. It's by appointment only, which you can usually book the same day. That way there's few people in the shop. The A/C is turned on to recirculate the air as opposed to other places I've been across the street have only fans on. Price was cheap too.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

The best in the business. No such thing as a bad haircut here. Chad and his crew do the best job and take their time. The shop itself is probably the most interesting room I have ever been in. Good conversation, great people, even better haircuts. You can't go wrong here, just a great barber.</Review>

<Review>I went here today because the barber I usually go to was busy. I really like this place. The whole room was having a conversation. The environment was really nostalgic with old KROQ stickers and vintage memorabilia.
I will definitely be back. My cut was super fast and just like I like it.
Great job.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Review>Great first experience at this Barbershop/hair store.  I was helped by Stephanie who was very friendly and made me feel like I had been there dozens of times before.  The decor of the shop is like a trip back in time.  I went in for a haircut and I left with a desire to tell more people about it so they experience the same thing.  Thank you.</Review>< user_id>

Chad has been my life long friend & the only person who I allow to do my hair. He is absolutely amazing. I can tell him to "Jst do whatever" & it always comes out so beautiful. Will NVR go anywhere else to anyone else. He is the BEST of the best.
The girls are always super sweet too. Great customer service frm all.</review>

< review>
Arco tends to be cheaper than most gas stations. This one is generally cheaper than the other big brands in the surrounding area.
Is a touch run down with graffiti here and there.
New card reader model in the pumps, so quick using a debit card.... But $0.35 card use fee added each time. Else, bring cash and go inside.
Arco's don't take credit to reduce the price for gas, but can result in headaches having to go to the bank first for cash if you want to avoid the card fee.
Access can be easy heading south towards the freeway, but requires a left turn at the light going North from the freeway. The light has a sign that says no u-turn, forcing you to make a left at the light, then another to enter the station.
Pump filled quickly without notice delay, stopped near the tank full capacity as expected without going over.< /review>

<Text>Gas is okay, no credit card or Gas Buddy card accepted, debit card has a .35 surcharge but you can do all purchases in one go including cashback (excepting at 10-10:30 and 2:45-3:15), station is closed between 1:45 and 2:45 for store reset but gas pumps are still usable. coffee fresh at 3 AM, 7 AM, 2 PM and 7PM. Disclaimer, I also work here most nights.< /Text>< name>

Well lit at night and friendly staff every time I've come here. Usual selection of snacks and cheap eats inside, can't speak to the condition of the restrooms. Great for gas and go.</Text>

Really modern church. The message is based on current times and easy to understand even to non-religious people. Also, I didn’t feel judged based on my apparel.<//review>

<Review>Cornerstone has been a blessing to my family. Easter Sunday is no exception. The word that is shared is thoughtful and heavenly. Dr. Ron and crew are genuine and human, they feel relateable and friendly. Cornerstone offers tremendous life groups, which we recently joined one. I'm enjoying each Sunday we attend, listening to something empowering and necessary. If you need a Jesus boost, head there and you too will reset your joy for God in your heart. God bless. 🙏❤<//Review><Response>None</Response><Name>Nacho 2020 G.< /Name>< time>

The most welcoming congregation I've ever experienced. Message was on point, and was very easy to understand. Fun and humorous pastor. We felt comfortable and at home. Amazing high-end production worship service. Extreme entertainment coupled with clear message. Must try at least once!!< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>We had the most wonderful experience attending Cornerstone. Pastor Ron always made his sermons somehow effect you personally. I was going through a very rough divorce and it seemed like every sermon was directed at me.

My time at Cornerstone was 1999-2005. My daughter’s helped me in the nursery and wherever else they could assist in.

I only left the church as I moved my family to Salt Lake City, UT. It was all for love: divorced again but received a grandson and watching him grow.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dc9ca65cbc88ad:0x3afaa2d2bc59e713<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We love Cornerstone Church!! We enjoy the 9AM Sunday Classic service in the smaller auditorium. It is smaller, more quiet and still lively and fun! We meet the nicest people there! The preaching is wise, intelligent, Biblical and easy to listen to. Come and join us!!<//Text>

<Review>If you are looking for a church that is real and transparent I have found this church as good as they get.  I usually do not write these comments but I was so impressed with the pastor’s sermon today and transparency that I felt I needed to.  We have only been coming here for 3 months and have not yet got involved so I can only comment from the little experience I have.  I drive from Corona to Lake Elsinore just to go here!< /Review>< pictures>

I decided to try out Cornerstone one day a couple of years ago because I had driven by it on the freeway for so many years. I did not know what to expect, other than what I had seen on their website about service times and where it was. The worship was contemporary and fun, and the sermon and pastor were both wonderful. All of the pastors teach from the Bible and have all of the readings from the sermon in our notes, to read along with, highlight and write notes on. The sermon notes also include a fill-in-the-blank type study to follow along with, which reinforces the principles that we just read about, and it really helps me to connect to what I'm reading. In addition, the pastors are the perfect balance of funny, energetic and reverent, which is even better than I had hoped for when I was trying out the church. Everyone at Cornerstone is so friendly, from the moment you get out of your car and every step of the way. I am so happy to say that after 5 years of "church-hopping" looking for the "right" church for me, I found not only that at Cornerstone, but I found a family too. The Bible study groups and ministry departments are such a blessing and I can't recommend this church enough if you live in the area.< /Review>

<review>After moving out here I spent considerable time searching for a new church. Cornerstone is right down the street from me but I searched the local area just visiting and listening. I was and am impressed with Pastor Ron Armstrong's sermons and have introduced others to Cornerstone. Everyone so far has been impressed with Pastor Armstrong's sermons but this church is not for everybody. Pastor Ron speaks fast so first you need to stay awake, second you will need to think at better than an eight grade level, next you will need to remember that not everybody wants to be your friend, there are a few individuals that visit here who just are losers and not friendly and they usually move on to spread their misery to like minded people. This is a strong middle class church that is very involved with the community and welcomes everyone, no membership requirements, no commitment, get involved as much as you wish, or don't. (You don't even have to be a Christian! But please understand English) Free parking!!!</review>< Rate>

Cornerstone is by far the greatest church I've ever attended. Our pastors are absolutely amazing. You never feel pressured to be any certain type of person, dress any certain type of way. There's no box you need to fit in to be accepted and loved at this church. Join us Saturday or Sunday!</review>

The pastor is an outstanding speaker and is able to explain sound doctrine in a practical way.   We value his sermons so much that we drive all the way from our home in Joshua Tree to Wildomar to attend.<//review>

<Date>1355026949352< /Date><rating>5<//rating><review>great church, and the celebrate recovery program works and it is awesome.  Only the truth is preached here out of the bible.  Three things to remember about true stories is that manger scene was a historical event, in more history than any bible.  Jesus really did exist and he really did die on a cross and he really did raise from the dead,  and it is documented in Roman history  IMPERIVM ROMANVM.

Great children's program, and I judge that by two things  if my kids want to go and I don't get called out of service,  then the love of God is present.</review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) It is an ideal place for reflection and energy to move forward. Highly recommended for when you have to take a break in life and think about taking a transsexual sedition. Hearing the word of God always comforts and fills hope with the critical moments but full of strength for those who rely daily on the Lord

(Original)
Es un sitio idoneo para la reflexión y tomar energía para seguir adelante. Muy recomendable para cuando  se tiene que hacer una pausa en la vida y se piensa en tomar una sedición trasendental. El escuchar la palabra de Dios siempre reconforta y llena de esperanza el lis momentos críticos pero llena de fortaleza para aquellos que se apoyan a diario en el señor< /Text>

After reviewing the 5G phone I was interested in purchasing online I went in person to check it out. Sean was quite knowledgeable and helpful with answering my questions and getting me set up with the right plan. The phone I wanted was in-stock and I am using it now!  It is recommended that you wear your facial covering for in-store visits at this time.< /text>

Daniel was the representative who greeted us immediately. He listened to what we needed - which was to ADD a new signer to an existing plan. He reviewed old plan and upgraded us to a newer plan with more benefits and features since I was grandfathered in with also lowering my monthly bill.

He was confident, attentive and provided me with positive outcome while making sure experience was safe and clean.

Daniel was quick and efficient. I’d recommend this location and return again.< /Review>

I went into the store to upgrade my phone.  Sean was very helpful & knowledgeable about the phone.  He suggested we upgrade our family plan (which was very old) and ended up savings us $30 per month!!  The best part is it was fast & painless!  Thank you, Sean!!<//Text>

He was also super easy to work with and I got a great deal. He was really nice and made our time there fun and informative. I would definitely recommend coming and seeing him for help. I always go to this location because they have the best customer service.</Text>< Time>

I purchased a $700 phone. The manager, George Cardinas assisted me. He did not ask if I wanted insurance for the phone or if I wanted to upgrade my plan. He just signed me up for both. He said the phone was 600.00 when, on fact, it was $699.99. I was not even offered a receipt. He said they would email it. I had no idea  my bill would almost double, especially since I paid $300.00 down. I should have gone to Target. He provided no customer service.<//text>

My wife and I went into the AT&T store at Vintage Oaks Novato, to buy a new phone that was compatible with her hearing devices. We were met at the door by the Manager Jorge and from that point on we were treated by him (Jorge) like we were putting him out.

We have been using this store for all our AT&T needs since we moved to Novato about 7 years ago and this was the worst experience we have had there. Hopefully Jorge can receive some customer service training or be reassigned to some other job where he has no customer interaction.< /Review>

I went to theVintage Oaks store today ( Novato Ca) with a problem with my new iPhone. Jorge helped me. After trying many times to connect my car to Bluetooth and going to dealership I could not get it to work. ATT was my last resort! I have to tell you that Jorge was SO helpful and got it all sorted out! I am disabled  and not having my hands free phone set up was very worrisome. So THANK YOU JORGE! He deserves recognition!< /Text>

I went to theVintage Oaks store today ( Novato Ca) with a problem with my new iPhone. Jorge helped me. After trying many times to connect my car to Bluetooth and going to dealership I could not get it to work. ATT was my last resort! I have to tell you that Jorge was SO helpful and got it all sorted out! I am disabled  and not having my hands free phone set up was very worrisome. So THANK YOU JORGE! He deserves recognition!<//review>

I got a new iPhone 11 here at the vintage oaks store  and worked with Eddie he was very educated on prices and promotions and made me feel comfortable the whole time I was T the store.  He lowered my bill and got me a discount on my phone which was amazing!!! I was expecting to leave spending $1000 on the phone will definitely be back!< /text>

Jorge has always helped me if I go to any other AT&T store they won’t know what to do and so I always go to the Novato store they are so professional and they always know what they are doing. Jorge deserves a raise👏 Thank you again Novato store your manager is doing a great job .</Review>

Came in a few days ago to look for a new IPhone. (I'm currently with another carrier and want to upgrade) I immediately was greeted by the staff when I walked in and they were extremely helpful with explaining the different plans to me. They sat with me and answered every question I had and gave me multiple different options with switching. Very happy with their service! Even when I was looking around everyone was super nice. I spoke specifically with Sean for about 15 minutes and it's safe to say I will be switching to AT&T!<//Text>

Wanted to upgrade my phone but they added a new line. They didn’t tell me I’ll be paying more every month. I traded in my old phone but i think the salesman took the phone to have because when i called customers service they said that it was not documented that i have traded in my old phone. Very weird. I went to the At&t store in Corte Madera and I explained my situation and they told me that they were disappointed of how the Novato At&T workers handled my case. They just wanted to make money and not help me. Do not go to At&T store in Novato. Poor service.<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>What a great experience at this store! Customer service at its best!!! I was helped by George and cannot recommend him enough. I switched from Verizon wireless because of unbelievably poor customer service at their Petaluma location. I should have switched a long time ago. George, the store manager was highly professional, efficient and knowledgeable, and has amazing customer service skills. For the first time in my life I felt like the sales professional was not there just to make a sale, but has my very best interests im mind. Its is such gratifying experience! He went above and beyond helping my whole family choose the phones that are right for us, and making sure we are happy with our choices. After a series of discounts my bill, compared to the previous cell service provider, was slashed in half for a much better plan. What else can you wish for? It is also such a pleasure to be treated like a VIP customer every time I come there. Those guys should somehow showcase their customer service model of excellence. This is how all customer service should be. From my business background I know very well that one store can boost the reputation, the image of excellence, and the perception among happy customers and a broad spectrum of the population in general that AT&T, a multimillion dollar corporation, is top of the line service provider that will take care of all your related needs. Thank you so much, George, for making me such a happy and grateful customer! You truly represent the best of the best in customer service!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1592856174295, 'text': 'Hello, We know that first impressions are very important.

I had a fantastic experience at this AT&T location. I was very unhappy with my previous service provider. I am thoroughly impressed with my new service and new phone! Everyone was so friendly and helpful.<//Text>

I went in to get a new phone and was upgraded to two new phones and two new lines for less money...so I thought!
Since November I have been trying to fix my bill and amount charged, and it’s still not what I was promised in the store by the sales team. This has been so frustrating. I wish I had never walked in there and never gotten a new phone. I will never go there again or send anyone I know.</Text>

<Review>First off a big thank you to (Eddie)  who works at this AT&T Store location! I was helped on 5-20-20 at about 12:45 pm. He is very professional and courteous so ask for Eddie if he is available!
I was with Verizon Pre-paid and my service was always slower then two sloths trying to fight.  0.9 down (MBPS)  and 0.12 up and I would lose my  connection  most of the time. Got the Unlimited Pre-paid plan and now I am getting 47.2 Mbps down and 23 Mbps up latency 35 !!

Absolutely terrible experience.  Purchased a new phone and plan and drove 20 miles to pick up the phone and it was not there and no one returned my calls.  Phone finally shows up but they did not call me to tell me it was in but I took a chance and drove the 20 miles.  The phone had a problem with app sign in and they could not fix it and said they would replace the phone, again no call to say the new phone was in and because of frustration I went to the Apple store in SF which was another hour out of my way and they fixed it in 5 minutes. Total of four trips there and one to the Apple store to fix a minor problem .  Do not go here to get a phone.<//Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) AT&T in Novato can't have a better manager / representative than Jorge Cadena. He was extremely kind and patient to listen to my needs and offer me an excellent service plan. I left the store very happy and satisfied. With the discount they offer for workers in the health sector, it is really very convenient to have their services. Apart from the excellent customer service, it should be noted how reliable their wifi service is. In fact today talk and connect on internet platforms without any interruption. 100% recommendable! Immensely grateful for such excellent service overall!

Salí de la tienda muy contenta y satisfecha. Con el descuento que ofrecen para los trabajadores del sector salud, realmente resulta muy conveniente contar con sus servicios. Aparte del excelente trato al cliente, cabe señalar lo confiable de su servicio wifi. De hecho hoy hable y conecte en plataformas internet sin ninguna interrupción. 100% recomendable! Inmensamente agradecida por tan excelente servicio en general!

This is a lovely, large market with a wide variety of high-quality produce, meats, fish, cheese, baked goods, flowers, and plants. The great community spirit is reflective of Pasadena, and it's always fun to go to this market. The Emu eggs photo is just for the novelty of it. Overall, prices at the market are reasonable.< /text>

I live in Washington now, but this market makes me wish I moved back to Pasadena!

We didn’t have troubles parking, however we arrived around 11:30 so the amount of people was slowing down a bit. This is an early market with some people selling out before they close so I would suggest visiting earlier!

The vendors and quality that everyone brings is some of the best I’ve ever seen!!

You will find the freshest of produce, flowers, and bulk items like nuts, dried fruits, honeys and marmalade’s, sweet treats and savory.

Most vendors seemed to be cash only although some took card. I didn’t have any cash and I’m on vacation and not doing much cooking so I didn’t get to take home any of the incredible produce, but if I lived here this would likely be my primary source of produce for my household!

My friend and I did buy some incredible dried cherries, apples, honey roasted almonds and jalapeño stuffed green olives from one vendor. We also got baked tapioca from another. I wish I knew the name of this vendor because that baked tapioca was one of the best treats I’ve ever had!! Not too sweet but light and fluffy. Ugh, I’m drooling!

This market is so lovely and I’m envious of the residents who get to experience it every Saturday!< /review>

<Text>There was a line to get in, which didn't take more than 15 minutes at about 1030. Masks required. Otherwise, not much is different. Great produce, honey, bread, eggs and pastured meat.  Food and juice stands are open. I love this farmers market. I have been coming here for over ten years and I always look forward to it.< /Text>< pics>

Really cute market with paid garage parking and lots of stalls. Variety is mostly Mexican but there's a few Asian Fusion stalls, eggslut, fancy PG&J, Clark Street Bakery (!!!), pasta, sandwiches, and more.Docked a star mostly because 1) parking garage gets pricey after the initial two hours and 2) the lines at some of the stalls are crazy.</review>

And the prices are reasonable for the quality. You really do get what you pay for here! I don’t buy seafood, pork/chicken, herbs, greens, fruits, veggies, honey, or nuts anywhere else by this market. And the icing on the cake is that the vendors are so kind, friendly, and genuine. Why wouldn’t I want to do my weekly shopping here? Only con, for me, is the parking, but I usually don’t have a problem with a little patience or coming super early or later.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Excellent selection of produce, plus a reasonable range of prepared foods.  I love having many different farmers who specialize in different kinds of produce, and there are all kinds of specialty fruits and vegetables I've never seen in a supermarket.  Best of all, it's a California certified farmer's market, which means the produce is grown in California and sold by the farm the grew it.  I get almost all my fruits and vegetables here now; I rarely even look at what they're selling in the supermarket anymore.<//Review>< Pictures>

I try to visit this Farmer's Market every Saturday. I definitely have my favorite vendors. And as you become more and more friendly and comfortable with the vendors, you'll receive discounts, suggested recipes, and an overall good feeling when buying from them.

I buy most of my garden plants here and have found very reasonable prices on hard to find varieties like Rose Geranium and Ahi Peruvian peppers.

This market is extremely popular and it is is often difficult to find parking.< /Text>

Awesome. SO much fun. The food is pricey, but that seems to be the case in all Southern California farmers markets. They have great prices on plants though.<//text>

I love this market! I love that its location draws people who come solely for the reason of visiting! You can't go wrong with any of the fruit and veggie vendors! I especially love the cheese vendor the man is so nice and always has amazing cheeses and olive oils. I especially like the tamales cart that also servers Pozole and menudo and has a variety of not only tamales and burritos, but salsas too! :)<//Review>

<review>This store promised me money back for turning in my old phone that could be used as installment payments towards the new phone and I am now on my SECOND phone call to TMobile to get this corrected as it has not been on the first 3 bills. It takes an hour and a half every time I call and according to the most recent bill it was a waste of time because nothing was done on the last phone call.  This store needs to stop promising customers discounts that they cannot deliver!<//review><userid>112060185797838301373<//userid><Resp>{'time': 1611169305466, 'text': 'I’m sorry to hear this Janelle.

Love love love this store! I had Metro for over 2 years and decided to switch to T-Mobile. I had such an amazing experience. I came in on Monday and was able to port over my number. They had a special promotion where I traded in my Samsung Galaxy S9 for the new OnePlus 7Tpro Mclaren and got so many perks. My phones paid off because of the trade in and the service is lightning fast. Sure it's a little bit more than Metro, but with Metro my service did not work. Not even in my house...with the wifi on... and for $60 it was not worth it.
Jacklynn was super friendly, quick and efficient. I came in 3 separate days and she made sure I was getting the best deal with my service and was able to explain everything to where I felt confident with my choices. I am already loving how amazing my connection is. Thank you much!!!

Update: I'm in Vietnam right now for vacation and my phone's the only one that works outside of the hotel 😂 5g best thing in the world. Thank you again!</Text>

Share my experience, the young lady at the counter was very informative and very knowledgeable about her job and products and things like that. Although a lot of the advertised deals didn't seem to make sense buy one phone get one phone not really true. But I guess is just like any other cell company out there right now you walk through that door you end up spending $1,000. Anyway like I say staff was very friendly and knowledgeable just wasn't super thrilled with the price.</Review>

I wanted to commend this store and the manager, Matthew, in particular for their efforts in helping me get my $250 credit for turning in my iPhone 6 during their trade-in, trade-up program.  I had turned in my phone to their store in October 2018 but never received the credit even though the store had checked out my phone and said it was fine.  Finally, in January 2019, T-Mobile called me to tell me that my credit was being denied because they said my phone had water damage.  This didn't make sense to me as I've never exposed my phone to water.  In any event, the T-Mobile rep on the phone was completely uncompromising with me even though I had turned in my phone in good faith and had been told my phone would receive the credit.  I told her that this episode had severely harmed my very positive relationship with T-Mobile that they had earned with me as a customer of more than 15 years.  Fortunately, the local store where I had turned in my phone made this right for me by providing me with a courtesy credit in the full amount to my account.  Matthew should be highly commended for his efforts to regain my customer satisfaction and loyalty after being treated so poorly by T-Mobile corporate.</Text>

Kyle is the best T-mobile employee I have ever met. He deserves some sort of a corporate award. Incredibly helpful, very polite, and remarkably patient... Such people change the entire perspective on a business. The assistance he offered yesterday was the best we've ever received at T-mobile.< /Text>

Friendly people but they seam to be having tech difficulties with their computer and devices accessing information and setting up some options with my account. Like auto pay. But they where able point out that I could use the app on my phone or go online to set up everything myself.< /text>

<Review>USAF Veteran: Erase that star. Walked in this afternoon, greeted by Yana. Been in before; today noone was waiting. Two other staff working. I tried explain what I needed; that I'm not very tech savvy. Negative answers right up front. I felt she didn't want to help me. (I showed her proof of my service, reminded her of the ad. Recent ad honor; working with Veterans.)She didn't show me how to do what I ask instead did it herself. All so negative though I said I need to understand before I leave. I felt demeaned; embarrassed.  There was no one waiting . Just me. I left almost in tears. Will return to friendly staff where I originally bought my phone in Folsom.  Yana said she doesn't work there.  She had on T Mobile shirt; name tag. I admit I don't know things but she who suppose know things lacks empathy; customer service skills. I'm a veteran she didn't help. When I ask her let's stop she was rude. Disappointed! Shame on you; other staff who witnessed; didn't intercede.  No stars from me.</Review>< Pictures>

Do not go to the store if you're having a problem with your device I accidentally turned on a voice program that's on my phone and did not know how to take it off or turn it off the girl tells me they are not trained for this we don't help you with your phone's we help you if you want to buy a new one I got very aggravated with her told her I was tempted to shut off my phone and also told her I was tempted to have my boss shut off all 70 + phones for the company I work for I don't understand why you have people on staff that don't even know how to operate the phones they should know something or at least have a number they can call to get help when our phones malfunction where we supposed to go</Review>

<text>I will admit that I am a biased customer of T-Mobile in CA and previously in Europe, but for a cell company I still feel that their customer service and offerings far surpass that of their rivals.  Their staff are ultimately focused on customer  service and yes, I may have had a few issues, but this store has always been abile to sort out any problems I may have had.

The store is easily accessible, clean and modern.  They have a good stock range, they are happy to let you browse and they do not act like second hand car salesmen and pressure you.  As for TMOBILE in general, I have found that their coverage is good, the prices beat their main stream competitiors and despite the appalling website, well worth considering, even if you are mid contact with someone else. But that's your fault for not using TMobile in the first place.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Such a great experience at the dental suite, it was my first time but the staff was so caring. The lady who helped take my x rays was just so nice and made me feel very comfortable. Dr. Baig, my dentist there, was super kind and we had a good chat about a bunch of things which made the experience so much more personable. My dentist did the actual cleaning whereas most other dental offices they have another trained person do it. The experience was painless. He gave me some good tips on taking care of oral health.<//review>< Date>

I first visited The Dental Suite last summer when they very graciously accommodated me on a short notice for a cracked front tooth, fillings, and cleaning. Parking can be a little difficult to come by so I would recommend you give yourself ample time to get here for appointments. Aside from parking, my experience here has been great so far. They've been following strict covid protocols that made me feel safe and secure in their office, which is kept exceptionally clean. Dr. Baig has worked on my teeth over the last several months and I've noticed a tremendous difference in my oral health. The rest of the staff at The Dental Suite are all so kind, patient, and incredible at each of their jobs. Thank you Dental Suite!< /review>

<review>Dr. Baig genuinely is the best dentist I've ever been too. The office is located super close to both mass transit and convenient parking facilities. The staff is friendly and well informed. 100% would recommend.</review>< Pics>

I hadn’t been to the dentist in over a year and have never been a fan of going. In fact, due to some bad experiences with dentists in the past, it’s something I dread! When I went to The Dental Suite for the first time, Dr. Baig and his staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful. Dr. Baig explained everything he would be doing in advance and consistently checked in with me throughout my procedures. The staff was so helpful and friendly and it was a dental experience like none other. I cannot recommend The Dental Suite enough!</Text>

<date>1608342323121<//date><Text>Had my very first visit at this dental office today and I left happy, satisfied and well taken care of! The staff is very professional. My dentist, Dr. Shayan, is knowledgeable and very thorough with his work. He laid out everything that needed to be done, and prioritized what needed to be done right away, and what can wait. I felt like he really cared about me and wanted to make sure I was comfortable with his recommendations. My previous dentist just saw me as an ATM machine, but these guys are the real deal!
I am definitely their permanent client from now on with or without insurance.</Text>< user_name>

Found this place on Zocdoc. Booked an appointment with one doctor (based on Zocdoc reviews), was let know that the doctor is out today, and I’m getting a different one. Giving this place benefit of the doubt, that’s ok. I think Dr. Baig, my “substitute” doctor, did everything well and was very attentive. The dental assistant / hygienist (young male, didn’t get their name, unfortunately) was very disappointing, however. Barely communicating, barely doing their job, barely half effort (post cleaning polishing, flossing). I shared my feedback on the check-out and hopefully this will get taken care of.</text>

<Text>Really great experience. Very clean and modern office. Punctual start. Everyone was so incredibly nice. The dentist herself was lovely and explained everything and was gentle but thorough. They have the latest equipment included oral cancer screening beyond the dentist just feeling around in my mouth.

Great dentist office. Calm, elegant atmosphere, everyone on staff is smart and knows what they are doing. Dr Inna takes her time, explains everything, has top-notch equipment, and does not push procedures. All of my two crowns and two fillings have been done completely pain free. Once my permanent crown arrived early from the lab. They called me to have it inserted earlier than planned so that I could avoid traveling abroad with the temporary one.
Front desk is the only one I have encountered in any doctor's office with whom you can actually have a pleasant conversation.<//Review>

Have been under Dr Inna care since 2007. I am a crazy brushes and love sweet stuff, so you can tell I have lot of dental issues.

But Dr Inna has superior skill, menticulous in attention, and very patient. So I am extremely happy with the services even though I moved and take at least an hour to commute in.

Highly recommend!<//review>

<text>UPDATE: lowered my previous 5 star review because they have a policy where you will get charged a fee if you cancel within 48 hours of an appointment however, they cancelled an appointment that I had less than 24 hours before.

Fantastic experience.  Efficient and professional.  Got a filling with no discomfort and it was over before I even realized.< /text>< Rating>

I've been a patient of Dr. Ina's for about 8 years now. She's gentle and professional, with state of the art equipment and I can always each an episode of Friends while I get my teeth cleaned (or cavities or root canal which she's done for me as well). I can't say enough about her, and her staff is amazing too. Can't go wrong, I have recommended her before and would do so again any day.< /text>

The Dental Suite is a very cozy and chill place. A dental practice you're not afraid off. Dr.Inna and her staff are super nice and professional.

Just a few great things about the place:
1. Location! Right in the Crocker Galleria, ground floor.
2. Convenient booking and flexible appointments.
3. Clear pricing, no hidden fees - everything explained, and no extra unnecessary procedures offered.
4. Netflix! And time is flying so fast...

I got my deep cleaning and white fillings. No pain, no anxiety, just nice and friendly people who care.</review>

<review>B-level service and pleasant, A+ doctors.

Not pleased in the slightest with the new location and how sleazy it feels to get in. Feels like a drug deal when you walk down a foul-smelling, dark alley to find their listing, ring their floor, and wait for them to buzz you into a dark, residential lobby without any signage. You have to call the slow, cloyingly fragrant elevator sheathed in questionably chartreuse padding, and wait the year it takes to move one floor up. Once you get there, everything is dazzlingly white and welcoming. But the journey there is quite something.

Also not entirely happy with the depth of the cleaning and mildly rough manner of the tech. But the dentist herself was welcoming, warm, and skillful.

All in all, aggressively average.</review><name>Dylan Gattey</name><pics>None</pics><Date>1528855254539< /Date><gmap_id>0x808580884a9ee2f5:0xe725395cdeb2ba85<//gmap_id><Rate>3<//Rate>< response>

<review>Jeff, the receptionist, was extremely helpful setting up the appointment, explained everything in detail, was very patient with my many questions, and saving money by using Paypal. I saw Inna, who is very trustworthy. Right now, they also have a great offer with another dentist on Fridays. I would have done that, but didn't have time on Friday.

I have been coming here for the last 10 years. Always excellent attention, totally impressed by the professionalism and efficiency from front desk to the dentist.. never a problem with insurance and a beautifully clean and modern office. Everyone is welcoming and all smiles when you walk in.. really nice experience, makes going to the dentist a pleasure! I would not go any other place!<//review>

Dr. Inna Rostker is the kindest and most professional doctor I've ever had. I normally am very nervous around doctors, but she made me feel so comfortable and relaxed. She clearly and concisely explained exactly what her procedure was and why she was doing it so that I knew what to expect. All of the staff in the office were also just as nice and welcoming. They keep the space very clean and it really feels like you are walking in to a spa. Bonus: you can watch Netflix while they clean your teeth! Greatest dental experience I've ever had and I will surely be recommending their office to all my friends and family.< /Text>

Almost perfect dental experience. From the receptionist, to the beautiful dental assistant and the amazing dentist... everything was almost perfect. I was more than hesitant seeing theor raggedy entrance and elevator. Once on the 2nd floor and lobby of office I was more than impressed. Diamond in the rough.
Everyone was truly friendly, not fake smiles and no service. They were honestly concerned with my happiness. They took x-rays and did my new customer intake quickly. After that their TV was then transformed into Netflix with headphones so I didn't have to hear the drilling into my teeth. So friendly...I was very happy. The only take away was 30 minutes after I left, the Novocaine wore off and I was writhing in pain. I called for a pain killer and was told they could only call in for 800mg motrin. I work in city, not live there... not reasonable.
I should have been offered something stronger before I left. I was in pain for 4 or 5 hours before I could sleep. To be fair, I think if I would have asked they would have provided this for me. Overall I was happy with this dentist's office. I would definitely recommend, and will return for any future dental work.<//text>

I don't plan on returning to this dental clinic and here's why: First of all, I had come in to see Dr Inna about my tooth hurting and all she did was poke and prod in my mouth for a few minutes and dismissed it as sensitivity.  No x-rays were taken on that visit. Then when i came in again for my full mouth x-rays, I was told that I had 3 cavities even though that was only a couple months later.

When I went in for my filling on Monday of this week, I had 4 Novocaine shots to the area where she was going to be doing the filling and I was numb from 3pm till 11pm.  My area surrounding my right eye was numb and also caused a lot of involuntary tearing. Aside from the unnecessary amount of anesthetic that was used, the doctor moved the drill and hit my lip causing it to bleed.  I'm left with a canker sore now that will be trying to heal for the next week.  No apology was even attempted.  A cotton ball was placed there and the drilling continued.

Because I had already not felt confident with the sensitivity response, I really had not wanted to return for the fillings.  Upon completion of this last visit, I am convinced that I need to find a new provider.

Jeff who works the front desk is amazing and super helpful though.  I will miss seeing his smiling face.< /Text>

Give you one bill before the appointment and then try to add 50% more after the appointment. Terrible people. This is what’s wrong with the American healthcare system.< /Review>

When I initially walked into the Dental Suite, I had a great first impression. The lobby was beautiful and the receptionist had all of my paperwork ready to go on a clipboard with a little sign that said "Welcome Teresa!" - a great personal touch. The receptionist personally introduced herself and was very kind. I filled out the necessary paperwork, as it was my first time at this office, and waited for the dental tech to call my name. Once they were ready for me, the tech didn't even call my name. I just saw her motion to the receptionist and ask if I was ready, which I found rather rude since I was sitting right there.

Then she took me back to get initial x-rays. There were no introductions. There was no "you can set your coat here and your bag there." There wasn't even an introduction to what she was doing. I just sat on the chair and immediately she was putting the x-ray shield on me. It was a very cold start. Then she proceeded to take, what I believe to be, way too many x-rays of my teeth. There were probably 20 or so pictures taken because so many needed to be done twice or three times for her to get a "good" picture. The whole process took about 40 minutes - way too long in my book.

Once Dr. Rostker got to me I felt like I knew more of what was going on. She went through the x-rays with me and explained what she was seeing. She was writing notes as we went which made me feel more comfortable that when she went back to look at my chart later, she would remember what we discussed. Then she proceeded to do my cleaning and asked if I wanted to watch Netflix while she worked - so nice! Dr. Rostker was great, but to be honest I'm nervous about returning if all of her staff is unsure and obviously nervous about their jobs.< /review>

<text>Wow, just Wow! I've been Dr. Inna Rostker's patient for several years now. I always wait to get to SF and see her as my dentist. In the beginning, I didn't know she'd had medical training before the dental training but IT SHOWS! She's sooo knowledgeable and sooo good at explaining not only teeth problems but also how they relate to the rest of the body. She never seizes to amaze me!
AND she's super precise, skilled  and efficient and her expertise just keeps growing. It takes her half amount of time than other dentists to do treatments. And who in their right mind wants to spend hours in a dental chair ??? (Although Netflix and neck massages help a lot ;)</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>I was a new patient of Dr. Rostker in March of 2016. I needed just a check up and cleaning.

Scheduling time was very easy -- in fact I was able to get an appointment just 1-2 weeks out. The office manager Jeff was very professional which I appreciated. I brought my completed new-patient paperwork in to the office and was lead to the exam room within just 5 minutes. My x-rays were taken, Dr. Rostker examined my teeth, and they were cleaned in under half an hour.

She did notice I had some minor cavities developing, and so during the cleaning Jeff had produced a treatment plan with out-of-pocket estimates based on my insurance. The proposal was quickly and clearly presented and I gave the go-ahead to fill the cavities. Dr. Rostker immediately performed the procedure and I was out of the office 15 minutes later. Overall the entire x-rays, checkup, cleaning, fillings took under 45 minutes.

I had a great experience that was both professional and extremely efficient, and hope Dr. Rostker will be my dentist for a long time.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808580884a9ee2f5:0xe725395cdeb2ba85</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Went in for cleaning, it was ok. Had an appointment and still had to wait a long time. And because if that only got half of the cleaning. The doctor chipped little of my front tooth in the back, so it's kind of annoying.< /Review>< Pictures>

This place was fantastic. I've been to train stores all over the west coast and  Las Vegas and this is hands down the best in SoCal if you're looking for N Scale, HO and hard to find kits.

Service was awesome. They let me dig around in stacks of N Scale rolling stock and they were far more friendly than most MRR shop owners. I will be going back down there every time I'm in the area.</Text>

I have been going to this awesome store for at least 30 years!  It changed hands 20 years ago and is STILL going strong!  How does a small hobby shop stay in business competing with the internet?  It is with AWESOME service, products and friendly, knowledgeable staff!  The Train Crossing is a family business and the owners all take pride in carrying on the family tradition.  This is my go to place for scratch building supplies and tools.  If they don't have something in stock, they WILL get it for you.  They have a dizzying array of trains, rolling stock and model landscaping supplies.  Check 'em out!</review>

Shop owner was engaged for 20 minutes with a friend about racing cars.  Could not get a word in edgewise.   Attempted to purchase some parts and a magazine.   Patiently waited from 4:29 to 4:53. Then walked out empty handed.
He was aware of my presence but seemed unconcerned.   Weird vibe in store.   Not train enthusiast    Seemed bothered when I asked for help on a pinion gear.  Never again.<//text>

< review>
This is my favorite cafe in San Francisco— the food is delicious and it has a great no-frills atmosphere. Whether you are vegetarian or not, you have to try the beetloaf— I’ve never had another sandwich like it. They also have a nice outdoor seating area and on Thursday/Friday nights they have jazz bands come in.<//review>

<Review>The night bar menu food and drink on its own is solid, but slightly expensive, which would make Atlas a 4/5. But the community vibes and live music make it a 5/5.

Find a weekend day, grab a book a drink and a snack and enjoy the vibes.< /Review><response>None< /response><Pics>None</Pics>< gmap_id>

Those is a great place for a quick bite alone or with friends. It is also an excellent place to sit and work. The atmosphere is pleasant. It is generally clean, quiet, and welcoming. There is some unusual artwork on the walls which works well. Outside seating is also an option.

The personal pizzas are a must try. The salads are decent too. It is definitely vegetarian friendly.

What makes this place excellent is the variety of (non-alcoholic) drink options. The ginger lemonade is highly recommended (it is quite ginger-y). The golden latte is delicious.</Review>

<Text>This local Mission Cafe is truly a cool casual spot. Great for friend, families, a date with live jazz. Breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, beer & wine +. The menu is delicious, can't go wrong and a total value. The roasted yam sandwich is delicious, the beet loaf is freaking amazing, toasty sandwiches and crisp salads are fab. Love the charm of the laid back way the chefs yell your number when your food is ready. Dig the patio where folks can chill with their dogs.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< UserId.>

The bean soup and salads are outstanding. The pizza is slow. The amber on tap is outstanding. Great place when it's not busy. When it's busy, the kitchen is not exactly FIFO, sometimes they seen to be calling the pizza numbers on reverse order, do you can be in for quite a wait.<//review>

This is such a great place.

They have excellent sandwiches, pretty standard bagels, and beer on tap. Their staff are also very hospitable/fun to talk to, and they have live jazz three nights a week.

If you are wanting something to do or a place to work, definitely come through here.</review>

good, consistent place to get some work done or grab a more leisurely lunch. There are some very innovative and solid menu items(beetloaf, no cheese pizza to name a couple). Prices are a bit high and expect to wait 20-30 minutes for a sandwich or salad, depending on the rush -- but you can always order online and pick up in-store<//Text>

Atlas is one of the few places I love which has managed to survive the neighborhood development. Check it out and you'll understand why. Cool ambiance. Cool staff. Cool menu. Cool art. It's about as San Francisco as cafes come!<//text>

< Review>
Stopped here for a quick breakfast and the atmosphere was welcoming and warm. We almost walked past it because of how small and hidden it is. A bagel and latte was the perfect combo for this little gem. Their croissants were pretty dope too! Service was friendly and quick. I'd definitely stop here again if I am ever in the neighborhood.</Review>

The menu is always the same and features things like hummus plate or smoke trout sandwich.  I can never quite find something to suit my tastes when I go but things are usually pretty decent.  Definitely pricey.< /Review>

I usually enjoy a coffee and sandwich here on weekends with varying quality and service which is fine considering the convenience. However, today while I was signing the receipt -- where I always tip --, the staff member tossed my copy at me while dismissively walking away. I didn't do anything to incite any negative behavior, but I tried to brush it off. Then I get my food, and it's incomplete. Again, not asking for incredible service. Just basic decency.</Review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>Great place for tasty, unpretentious coffee, served with a blank stare. Food is generally overpriced and takes a bizarrely, frustratingly long time. Like, I've waited 45 minutes to get a $14-ish sandwich that barely weighed more than the two slices of bread it was on. Breakfast items are faster and pretty tasty. Used to get those on the regular.<//review><user_name>Kimball Stone</user_name></record>

With so many hip/white walled/minimal cafes around the city, I'm always happy to discover a place more old-school and cozy place. I like to go here to get some work done. They have a lunch/dinner menu as well. You get 2 hours of free WIFI with a purchase.<//Text>

This cafe is an awesome local business. They make great sandwiches (lots of veg options too) and are dog friendly. I love the golden beetloaf, one of the best veg sandwiches in SF in my opinion!< /review>

<user_id>117886155130370124255</user_id><review>I used to come here a lot years ago and loved it.  I remember there being a wonderful patio that is dog friendly (which is still there) so when I moved back in May with a dog I came for a visit with a dear friend.  An 18 year vegetarian I ordered a pizza (that had ham in the recipe) to put ham on the side (for the dog).  They put the ham on the side and on the pizza, but since it was so finely cut and cooked it resembled the fried onion on the pizza and I did not notice until I ate a good portion of it.  That is what I get for trust.

However it doesn't get better. My friend ordered the beet salad and really loved it until she found a hair,  that I assure you, did not belong to us.  When I brought it to the worker who takes the orders, she simply said "Sorry", with no aspiration or concern to amend the situation.   The food is really great so it makes me sad because I used to love this place.  But please, go somewhere else for the sake of your own health safety.

Oh, and they don't refrigerate the almond milk so it coagulates and ruins your coffee.

I really wanted to make this my new favorite puppy spot but after this I just can't.</review>< username>

Good breakfast egg goods, but worker's have horrible attitudes. It's uncomfortable at times to go support the business because staff is unfriendly.</review>

This is a great spot to stop in no matter what you're in the mood for or what time of day. Coffee and reading on a comfortable couch, a quick lunch by yourself, dinner with friends, or late night beers. They also have several vegan/vegetarian options. The staff is very friendly. Overall it's a neighborhood favorite!< /review>

I have a soft spot for Atlas Cafe since I first started going there back in the late 90s.  I'll never forget the first time I tried their yam sandwich...it was a memorable taste moment.  It's a great neighborhood spot with solid food and drinks.  I love the fact that they have outdoor seating and in general, prices are reasonable.</text>

I only get sandwiches and coffee here, but everything I've tried has been good.  The service is quick, and they offer an interesting variety of sandwiches with good vegetarian options.  The staff is always busy, so know what you want before you get to the cash register.  They will get annoyed if you don't leave a tip, so be a good patron and do it!<//Text>

Nice place to settle in and get some work done, friendly service. I often come here to meditate about the deeper meaning behind the hit 1996 film The Nutty Professor, is it meant to symbolize the struggle between the conscious and unconscious, chaos and order, the weight of society and the modern epidemic of loneliness and a need for meaning.
Plus there's free WiFi here!< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>As far as cafes near my work, this place is reliable. I initially felt meh about this place but their hours are good and it’s hard to fine a cafe in San Francisco of this size. The back corner has outlets as well as the sofas and one outlet outside. There is ample seating. They have changed their rule to two hour WiFi with a code available on purchase. The baristas are very nice about remembering to offer it to you when you purchase something. Also with the culture of work from home, I can see how that would affect businesses so I’m not mad. This is a great place to meet with a friend because it’s not as quiet and awkward as some other places. The outdoor patio and tables on the side of the building are also really nice. PS turkey bacon avocado sandwich. PSS scrambled eggs can be ordered at breakfast without having to eat bagels or croissants #keto<//Text>< pictures>

Stopped serving breakfast way before the time their menu says they do, and the cashier seemed to be a bit terse about it. Thereafter, I witnessed a breakfast item being cooked and served to someone. Not sure what to think about that... Also, there's a dearth of outlets for a coffee shop. Not a great look.</review>

Great neighborhood coffee place. The outdoor patio is especially lovely. I love that whether indoors or outdoors there is ample seating at Atlas. In addition to coffee they also have great salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. There are other coffee places in the area but this is a great one when you want to sit and relax for a bit over coffee and food.<//text>

A cute vegan-friendly cafe in the Mission. I've tried the roasted yam sandwich, the apple grilled cheese, and the chocolate milk, and all of them were fantastic. It's also fairly spacious inside, but the table setup would make me skeptical of visiting with large groups. The place sells food, coffee, and beer, so it's a great place to chat into the night with friends and catch up. My only gripe is that it's a bit of a walk from the BART, but that's more of an issue with the neighborhood's layout than the actual restaurant.<//text>

<text>In a building tucked away behind warehouses and homes lies Atlas. At Last! I've finally found it is how you'll feel when walking around the corner wondering where you're headed. Once you get inside you'll know you've come to the right place with prices that are up anyone's alley. I usually get the Egg Steamers on a bagel - to die for and under $4!  On nice days try and steal a spot outside in their back patio but they have windows looking out so inside isn't so bad either.

Atlas offers a wall of magazines to choose from so if you just need to get away from home and sit with other like-minded people, check out Atlas Cafe.< /text><GmapID>0x808f7e376a89427b:0x201b8c1f186aa9fc</GmapID><pictures>None</pictures>< Time>

Love this cafe. The ambience is excellent for getting work done, and the vibe is laid back. Quickly becoming one of my go-tos. Food could be better hence the 4 stars, and the coffee is overpriced. Try a little harder on the sandwiches!<//Review>

Great service, too - when I didn't make it clear what kind of coffee I wanted, the barista started over and followed my unusual request to a tee, even though it was probably my fault she didn't understand me in the first place. Keep up the great work!</Review>< resp>

As for the food, I love it... It's yummy and tasty and I never feel guilty about eating whatever it is I ordered that day! For example, the last time I went I was absolutely starving... I ordered the grilled cheese with apples + the soup of the day (brussel sprout + squash + bacon = absolute deliciousness!), and a diet coke... All for the price of $11... I ate it all and was as happy as can be!<//review>

<text>Atlas Cafe is a wonderful neighborhood gem. Unpretentious, timeless, and full of character. You can enjoy a great Espresso drink while talking with your friends in the sunlit terrace, or grab a magazine and read in solitaire. If you're a dog owner, enjoy a table outside while your dog sunbathes.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Bite the bullet and buy the $$$ dinner tickets. This is one of the most fun meals I've had in the city. Hyped for a long time, and it was the perfect birthday treat. Be prepared to eat for about 3 hours and have your mind repeatedly< /text>

This area in the mission has definitely seen a growth of small restaurants and bars, Atlas is a genuine article in the sea of trendy things in the mission. Decent coffee, tasty breakfast and lunch options, lots of space, and medium fast wifi. I long for the days when this area was a little less happening.< /Text>

Try the Atlas Classic Tuna sandwich, you won't be disappointed.  Many of the bagels and pizzas are equally tasty.  So, how to have a great lunch or brunch is easy: Grab these items and sit right on down at a table in the outside portion where it is almost always sunny.  Rinse and repeat.  You're welcome.</text>

Great food. A little pricey. But they get a 1 star because the iced tea is $3 and there are no refills. I asked why, and I was told "everything costs". Well, it "costs" 22 cents to make a gallon of iced tea. You're just being petty when you charge $3 AND don't refill it.</Review>

Atlas Cafe has a winning combo for me of a pleasant and clean casual atmosphere, friendly folks, jazz and tasty vegan options, oh and it's affordable and close to lots of goings on in the mission. Try the avocado and beet pizza. Do you have a 6 star rating? Here's one: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐< /review>

Fun, chill neighborhood cafe with live music, comfy couches and outdoor seating. Good for studying, working on your laptop, or relaxing with a beer, tea or coffee. Come on a sunny afternoon, enjoy the live music and get a table outside.</Review>

Lovely old school cafe with outdoor seating and more moderate pricing than more upscale newer cafes.</review>

Ordered to-go twice: pizza and a ham sandwich. The pizza was bland but I ordered cheese so no fault of theirs. The ham sandwich had baby tomatoes (tasty!) but was a bit burned.

Overall: fast, filling, and pretty inexpensive!</text>

< Review>
A coffee shop that's been around before the neighborhood became hip.

I usually visit here to get coffee and sandwich to go. Only sat inside few times. They have lots of seating available, inside and outside, where you can catch up with your friends or work away on your laptop.< /Review>

Food is good, though their selection makes me wonder. They don't have staples, and what they do have is okay. I always feel hungry after going there. Their coffee is acceptable, but not as good as say Coffee Bar. I would never say no to going to Atlas Cafe, but I can't say there aren't better places in the area.</review>

I've had a few pizzas and sandwiches here. They're very tasty. My only complaint is that the crust on the sandwiches is often burnt and not a real pleasant experience. I had the vegetable noodle soup once and it was amazing.</Review>

<review>I've only come here for breakfast on a Sunday morning.

I would say this place is cute, but not a 'brunch' place in the city. You come here to get a bagel or something pastry-esque to eat, and then you have your cup of coffee. It's not very crowded, but it's also not a place where you'll be waited on, have a great selection for food, etc.

Come here if you live in the neighborhood and want to avoid long lines!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

The perfect all-around café. If there's one place I'll miss after leaving SF, it's's Atlas. Grab a beer, a coffee, breakfast, lunch or dinner, indoors, outdoors, sit there for a few hours, just pop in for a second, hear some live music, you can do it all here

Only cautions: if you sit there for a long time, your clothes will smell a little smoky later. Also, don't get the eggs (they're steamed, which isn't great) but everything else on the menu is good (especially the spicy chicken pizza and soups!)< /text>

Great workspace. Coffee and food are reliably good, free wifi for 2hrs. Plus there is a little garden out back.<//Text>

The best thing I tried at the Atlas Cafe was the Golden Beetloaf sandwich. I don't eat meat so the patty was interesting to see (definitely looked like beef) but it was totally made of beets. I also had a ginger lemonade - I love ginger so it was a really refreshing beverage. Atlas Cafe also has live music on some days, free personalized wifi and a greenroom area in the back where it's really peaceful to study.< /Review>

Been here a few times. The food and coffee is good -- I really loved the beet salad. The ambiance is kind of meh -- every other minute the staff shout the order numbers that are ready at the top of their lungs. When they clean the dishes it's like they throw them from the tub into the sink as loudly as they can. Makes the environment kind of negative for me. Also, the wifi is super slow when it's busy.

Update: Downgraded to 2 stars since they don't update Google with their winter hours (so I showed up to find them closed). Come on!<//text>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>I live across the street from here, and I've come here on and off, mostly for coffee. I've been there occasionally for live music at night, but I was under the assumption that they didn't have a liquor license. Well, it was apparently a mistake to ask on a sunday morning, because the woman at the cashier rudely answered that they did serve alcohol and then walked away, acting busy and completely ignoring me and my husband for the next five minutes. It was really awkward. Perhaps its my fault for expecting a "sorry, i have to take care of such and such", or something resembling politeness and friendliness. If they used to be cool, they're certainly pretentious now. Sightglass is much, much better. You want to go there! And, if you want food, there are lots of great places to eat at alternatively, but progressive grounds is probably the closest equivalent.</Text>< GmapID>

An outstanding nutrition care - ordered a sandwich, pay for it and get nothing. Be in shape with Atlas Cafe!

P.S. Music was nice.< /Review>

Nice little cafe.

More lunchplace-ey than coffeeshop-ey, but, well, not every cafe can survive on people buying a $2 coffee every few hours while they sit on their laptops, or worse, scribble in notebooks.   Which is too bad.< /Review>

Came here because I saw it on 'Senses 8', a programme on Netflix. It was a lovely setting with wifi for 2 hours, indoor and outdoor seating. Food looked delicious and was around $10 mark. The staff were friendly and helpful. Tea range is great, coffee is fab and they have alcoholic drinks (beer, wine) and one of the biggest ranges of kombucha- they do a delicious green tea kombucha! Would recommend to go here for either catch up with your friends or studying! Has been around for 20 years so well established and knows what's up.<//review>

The cuban sandwich was so good.  The bread was perfectly toasted, crunchy, not burnt or too hard. Cheese was melty.  The yam sandwich was warm, perfectly naturally sweet.  Tahe asian side noodle was ok.  I didn't like tge souoy dressing, but I can taste the cashew bits.  Great place to hang out.< /text>
