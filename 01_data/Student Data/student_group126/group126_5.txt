The only positive from my experience was that the location was clean and the receptionist/aide was friendly. The doctor came in and guessed my diagnosis of a sinus infection before listening to me or examining me because many of his recent patients supposedly had sinus infections. Then, as I tried to explain to him my symptoms (none of which would be from a sinus infection), I noticed he was texting on his phone and not listening to a word I said. I stopped talking and waited for his attention as he continued to text away for at least another 30-45 seconds. When he finished his text, he tucked his phone in his pocket and then opened his lab top and again started diagnosing me without examining me or listening to me. He didn’t even realize I had stopped talking and there was no apology or explanation for his rude behavior.  He asked me if I had certain symptoms that might go along with his diagnosis, but I hadn’t experienced any of them and his diagnosis seemed really off to me. He ended up doing a quick check of my heart/lungs, ears, and throat and ordered a blood check which had to be done twice because the aide didn’t write the results and forgot them. The blood work came back fine. The doctor offered me a steroid shot with antibiotics of which I declined since I didn’t trust him or agree with his diagnosis. I left as quickly as I could.< /review>

My wife & I had the pleasure of receiving efficient care and professional treatment on the two recent occasions when we received our Moderna Covid-19 vaccine inoculations.  From the clean, modern facility in Carlsbad to the trained and personable medical staff, Urgent Care 3D transformed a potentially stressful event into an easy and calm experience.  Thank you all for a job well done!<//review>

Horrible company. Do not go there. I went to get my COVID19 test required by my employer. Taken the rapid test many times in Texas. Made an appointment with UrgentCare3D on Monday. They said call when I got there.  Called and they don't pick up. Waited 15 mins for them to pick up and then they put me on hold. HERE IS THE WORST PART: they sent out a nurse to do a nasal swap in the person in the next car, then comes straight to my car to swap me. She is holding the swap samples right next to each other and they administer is. Same hand, touching each other, not following proper protocol. Cross contamination of the swaps. If the person next to me had it, then the nurse could have given it to me. I'm reporting to County Health Department and CDC. When she came to my window I rejected the swap until she went in and changed her gloves and dropped off other sample. All about the money. The I request written results. They never sent. Called for three days and won't pick up. Emailed and messaged and won't respond. Horrible company that is endangering people's live.</Text>

< Review>
During this whole pandemic, I know all medical providers are overwhelmed and we now can try & improve to learn from it.  It was difficult to contact a person in the office in July 2020.  No one was answering phones, the voice mail was full a couple of days in a row.  We drove down to the office since their voicemail full, the message stated they were open & taking walk-ins.  When we got there they were actually locked up with no answer.  I returned the next morning, since I still could not get through by phone, and after a lengthy wait outside I was able to make an appointment, but it was a week away.  The following week I took the appointment that I originally scheduled for my husband because the got positive covid results an hour before. (I found another facility that took him immediately.)  They were quick & I was done and home within a half an hour WITH test results.  We'd scheduled for the retest as soon as they recommended & I was home to quarantine with my husband.  I was so relieved that my insurance was covering 100% cost with no copay; amazing.  I was not nearly as lucky when I returned to retest.  When I checked in they told me that there was a change & now there was a charge.  With my insurance I usually have a $10 copay, so I gave my debit card.  UNFORTUNATELY,  I was wrong.  She charged my card, without stating the amount, for $150 which was on top of what my insurance was paying.  I freaked out because, not only could I not work for 2 weeks, my EDD benefits had a problem & I wasn't receiving anything.  I asked if I could change the card to a different one, but no they could not void or refund the card, which was their office policy.  Their lack of communication was significant as well as their lack of caring.  When I mentioned it during the facetime call with the doctor, she said she had nothing to do with their front office.

I was beyond relieved to get a negative test result & drove immediately to work in hopes to dig myself out even more.

At first I was impressed with their ability to have the quick test, but after seeing that some of their technology is way ahead of others, their business attitude is way behind.  They could really use more training & communication skills.< /Review>

This place is the worst. My wife had a 5pm appointment and it took them over an hour before she was seen. She came in for one simple test(not Covid) and she is still there. They only have one doctor working. If your looking to waste over 2 hours of your time then this is the place for you. I would recommend going somewhere else were they have more then one doctor working. You can go through Scrips emergency room faster in Encinitas!< /text>

Staff was fast and efficient.  However  when calling back for lab results, no one answers telephone and mailbox is always full ! Lab test was done on July 02 and is still not back today on July 16th. Simple urine test. ☹< /Text>

The facilities are new and extremely clean.  Everyone was professional and kind.

My sons have also had their sports physicals done here and it was quick and easy.

Definitely my urgent care of choice.<//review>< user_name>

I’m sure the establishment is good, but one of the employees was super rude over the phone. Albeit, we were in the wrong as well because we were cancelling an appointment very close to when it was scheduled. However, IMO there’s not an excuse to be rude and condescending in the medical profession. Again, I’m not commenting on the establishment at all or even on this woman’s professional ability as a nurse, however be prepared to possibly deal with a very rude employee over the phone.< /Review>

<text>My daughter has terrible strep throat and we went in there at 745pm. They close at 8. They called in the wrong prescription to the pharmacy 4x the dose allowed. So my daughter had to go all night without meds and was in excruciating pain. Went back to pharmacy next day and they called on the wrong one again.   Unbelievable. They should not be practicing medicine. Absolutely terrible</text>< pics>

I went in with an infected bite. The staff was wonderful. They did a great job getting me cleaned up. They made me as comfortable as possible considering what I had to get done, I won't go into the gory details. The building was clean and the rooms were really nice. I recommend them to anyone. A really great place.< /Review>

I went in as I had a serious problem. They did an exam and took a urine specimen and I realized when I got the tests back that there was no results for the urine test. That's where the problem was and they said they'd be happy to do another sample if I wanted to come back in this. I would not recommend this place to anyone</Text>

If I could give less than 1 star, I would.  I went there for a foot injury with only 1 person waiting for his wife in the waiting area. Two people came in after me, and they took one of those individuals before me.  I believed I was the next person to be seen.  I then asked how much longer I would be waiting, and they said the two individuals were ahead of me.  WOW!  Urgent care is suppose to be on a first come first serve basis.  After waiting 30 mins, I walked out.  Worst customer service and waste of my time.<//Text>

This place was extremely disappointing. First they told them they accepted my insurance and then when I was seeing the doctor she said they don’t take my insurance. Then the doctor proceeded to tell me there was absolutely nothing she could do to help my cough even though this is the third week I’ve It and was crying in her office because this cough is becoming very disruptive in my life. The doctor gave me a few musinex samples and told me there was nothing she could prescribe me when I specifically told her I was couldn’t afford to buy an over the counter medications. I asked if she could prescribe me something to help with my cough so I could run it through my insurance and she said no. It was clear this clinic only cares about getting money and not actually helping patients. Very disappointed.<//Review>

<Review>Save your money! Very disappointed. I saw a N.P. Nicole Pillsbury.  I had a horrible cough and sinus infection. She said she would not proscribed antibiotics unless I had Pneumonia. So I had to have a chest x-ray. Thank god I didn’t have pneumonia. No pneumonia no help! Told me to continue with the over the counter medication I had been taking. I told her I had been taking it a week and it was not working. Still no help. Not even something to help me sleep as I had been up all night coughing. Complete waste of time and money. Don’t go there.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Dr noonan was terrific and was cool.  Got my strep under control and only Doctor to offer me a steroid shot with strep ever even though had it in May with a punctured ear drum.  Wish someone would have offered me that a time or two before.  Office clean and modern.  Staff was awesome.  Move to New Mexico please doc I know it would kill your surfing though.  Saved my vacation.  Heading to zoo because of you.<//Review>

<text>Dashed over just before 7:30pm on a Friday evening with a sprained or broken finger (basketball). Were so happy they were open. Since my son was in a lot of pain, we thought the finger may be broken. They were able to x-ray it and confirm it wasn't. The staff were all very friendly and caring. Highly recommend.</text>< pictures>

They misdiagnosed me with a cyst that turned out to be a tumer. They recomended 8 weeks of a hot compress. If I didnt go to another doctor for a second opinion who knows what thier negligence could have done to my long term health. Misdiagnosis and failure to diagnose is malpractice. I would have rather your doctor tell me she simply didnt have the educational background to properly diagnose what I have then guess and gamble with my life. Not cool, not cool at all.< /review>

<text>Truly state-of-the-art facility with professional and friendly staff. I came in with a broken finger and Dr. Doonan took his time and helped get me to where I needed to be in order to recover quickly. He's one of the kindest, most knowledgable physicians I have been to. Would highly recommend this urgent care to anyone in the Carlsbad area.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<review>We live very-very close to this place and it is covered by our insurance, so we have been going there a lot. But not anymore. Each time I feel like my family is somehow under diagnosed and over treated at the same time. Almost every visit ends in a prescription of antibiotics (usually z-pac, regardless of the type of infection). One time they prescribed my child TamiFlu, which is only used within the 48 hours of the flu, while she had been sick for 5 days by then.  They order expensive tests without notifying of potential cost consequences (and my regular provider said that those viral panel swabs are completely unnecessary), and their billing provider is the worst... I lost $200 FSA (pre-tax) money, as the Computer Billing Systems - the provider they used - double-charged for the same test and refused to refund on time.  And one time, when I needed stitches (simple, right?) they turned me away and sent to ER. I am only giving the 2 starts because the office is clean, staff is friendly and it is conveniently located.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Terrible. Was out of town on a camping trip and noticed an area of concern on my leg. Chills, pain redness etc. told dr. Hugely misdiagnosed a blood infection for a simple “vein problem”and he Said to compress the area and lose weight!!! Had to go to the ER because of this ridiculous doctor that could’ve cost me my life!

I’ve been a patient of Dr. Doonan’s for about 4 years now.  I initially was seen at his office in Newport, but moved to San Diego last year, just in time for his Carlsbad office to open.  Dr. Doonan and his staff are extremely knowledgeable, dedicated, intelligent, caring and are very consistent.  I haven’t found a doctor that comes near the level of care that I receive from Dr. Doonan and his staff.  I highly recommend!<//Text>

I needed a chest xray to verify I was suffering from pneumonia.  This urgent care was one of only a few that had a xray machine. Unfortunately, it took me 1 1/2 hrs to get my xray, and another 1 hr to get my prescriptions sent to CVS - This place is clean and well maintained. But the staff is very slow in getting things done. Don't be in a hurry to go somewhere afterwards</review>

Be prepared to sit in a room by yourself for an hour, then expect staff to not listen, had sinus infection and some PA would not give me the antibiotics I knew I needed, ten days later still raging illness and insist I come back in for 'evaluation', drive to Encinitas, it's worth it<//text>

I've been here more times than I can count since I was little. Recently went for a wedding and it's still like I remember. Which to me is a great thing. I spent some time in the bar, the bartender is friendly and makes some good drinks! Try the Mexican lollipop! Tastes exactly like one.<//Text>

I would give 4 stars for the wines, and 0 stars to the kitchen, which apparently closes at 3:30 pm, the same time as our reservation. We were not informed of the kitchen closing at that time, so were not allowed to order any food. We could also not bring any snacks of our own. We understand that food from the outside may not be allowed, but we should’ve, at least, been informed that the kitchen was closing at 3:30 pm. You may want to call and ask ahead of time. The only saving grace was a stop at Rangeland Winery where the wonderful owner, himself, was grilling the tastiest hamburgers. I would definitely recommend them and their hospitality.< /text>

An expensive burger and sandwich which you can get better at Wendy’s and sandwich at mr pickles and subway. The place is beautiful we don’t even get a side with our entree. You have to share a bowl of fries with 4 people. The server was amazing he is a black person with a big heart took time to explain each wine and conversed with us . I believe if you’re going to charge that much make you’re plate have some kinda of presentation. It was very low quality for the the beautiful wine country the wine are terrific u need a better plate for what you charge I won’t go back there.  For the food I’ll definitely go back for the wine and atmosphere so the 4 points ....,,,,,,
is for the place , the 2 points for   the food. and it was disappointing on the food service was great the wine was good maybe you need not to serve plates that are not worth the money. You may think my name means nothing to you but I have clients and have a small business and do refer.</review>

<user_name>Robert Scott<//user_name><Text>Not worth the money.

I have been to Halter Ranch before and actually enjoyed it. I’m not sure what went on, but suddenly the wines are very overpriced for what they are, and there is an exorbitant tasting fee for a mediocre experience. We sat for twenty minutes before the first wine was poured, and our hostess didn’t tell us much about the wines. Do yourself a favor and book an experience at Daou instead.</Text>< resp>

This is a special property. The wine is excellent, the ranch gorgeous. Truely an amazing modern winery at the cutting edge. Was lucky enough to tour the property and barrel taste in the cellar. The proprietors are generous. Loved it here, can't wait to return. Stop here, you'll love it<//Text>

Jaime!!!! Thank you for making my Spring shipment (using the new app's chat feature) painless,  easy and fast! Very patient with my questions and now my wine is on the way! Doing this everytime!

This property is my favorite! The tour is awesome and educational. The wine... quality!!! 2012 Cab is the holy grail of Cabs in my opinion.

Halter Ranch and staff rocks! Cheers!<//Review>

This is a gem that most people haven't seen. The wine is amazing and different. All estate and it shows. It's a must visit and take the tour, it's one of the most unique one you will ever participate in. In all, be ready to be transported.</review>

What a wonderful experience. Two of our friends recommended a visit to Halter Ranch and we were not disappointed.Katherine gave us a tour of the vineyard and wine making facility explaining in detail each part of the process. The wines were delicious, Kevin the winemaker is clearly making some outstanding wines, with potential for ageing for 10-15 years. We came away with 3 bottles of wine and 3 new friends from our tour. I would highly recommend a visit to this place.< /review>

Great wines,  beautiful facilities, and wonderful people!  If you haven't done the winery tour to go visit the Ancestor Tree,  it's well worth your time (and perfect for a romantic occasion).

The winery also has a few event dinners every year which are spectacular. We've been going for years,  and have a wonderful time every time.< /Text>

We had a great time visiting Halter Ranch.  This place is a must stop especially if you like friendly service, great scenery, and really good wine.  If you have the kids with you ask them for the bug catcher kit...Our children loved exploring the beautiful Halter Ranch Grounds.  Thanks for a great time!</review>

The tasting room is set on a hillside overlooking a beautiful vineyard valley.  The tasting room architecture is superb with the main counter facing a glass wall that looks out onto the view.   They have a limited selection of meat and cheese in a small deli case that you can snack on while enjoying the expansive patio.  I took my Taiwanese in-laws on their winery and cave tour and everyone had a great time taking pics with the barrels and seeing the crush room.  This winery is growing and its right at the breaking point of where it can still be called a small winery.  The wines are solid, rich and powerful like most California wines but these do showcase the great climate and terroir the vineyard has.</Text>

A really lovely place to do a tasting. The main tasting room has a gorgeous view of the vineyards and the hills. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.
There is a good selection of cheese and charcuterie available for a picnic in the large patio area. If you are inclined, the tour is a great way to see how the wines are made.
Halter Ranch wines are an excellent example of the Rhone varietals and blends from the central coast. I think you will be pleased. After the tasting treat yourself to some great Italian food at Buona Tavola in downtown Paso Robles.
Go. Taste. Have a great day</Review>

The tasting room has one of the most amazing views in the area. The tasting room staff is always amazing. Try the CDP or the Tannat.< /Text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Text>This place rocks, with its outstanding customer service look and feel.   Halter's product are the Crème de la Crème of the Paso Robles region, in our humble view.  The wines, are STELLAR GREAT.  One of our favorite wine makers, with product that rivals L'Aventure and LeCuvier, both of which are in the clearly top of class in the region.   Halter Ranch and the entire team that has hit a grand slam.   Join their wine club, and use them for entertaining.  You will really enjoy the entire experience.  Highly recommended (and no, we do not work for Halter Ranch).  LOL :)<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><time>1416851191278<//time></record></dataset><record>

Command unit on my 2013 Mercedes failed. Replacement would have been about $5000. No company here in the Seattle area has the repair expertise. Heard about Hi-Tech, shipped the unit to them. Bijan, the owner, kept me informed, going out of his way to make sure I was happy. It is so refreshing to deal with a company who puts customer satisfaction  first. The unit was returned, professionally packed, works perfectly, and all for less than $800, with a warranty. These folks are pros.< /Text>

I lost my hope that my car navigation system can be fixed, but Bijan and people in Hi-tech fixed everything and now all works like new. Prices are very good. Great Customer service. Very professional team.< /Review>

Have a 2015 Tundra and the motherboard went out on it. Shipped it to them and they Diagnosed and fixed the issue. Very professional. It was a bit more expensive than I thought it would be but very happy with the end result. You get what you pay for and I’m happy with the end result. Thanks.</Text>

<Review>I had the best advice from Bijan Hi-Tech Electronics!!
I own a BMW E66 that went to a situation where the radio, CD and navigation or the whole sound system lost. I took my car to a local BMW dealer and guess what, they spent 3 months but still not been able to identify the problem. They suggested to me need more than 7 hours (more than thousands of dollar) to strip search the cables or leave the issue as it is, that was amazing. I wrote emails to Bijan and got very helpful advice and I finally fixed the problem myself by replacing an AM/FM tuner.
Finally, I would like to say a big thank you to Bijan from Australia. I strongly recommend this company to anyone.<//Review>< Name>

A local Bmw shop said they couldn’t fix it and they would have to order a refurbished one from Germany at $2,600.  I googled everywhere for a place that would fix it. After much searching and calling, I found this company.  I always have doubts about out of state businesses that I’ve had no prior experience.  But after reading their reviews and phone talking with Omar, one of their technicians, I felt confident they were reputable and trustworthy.  No charge if they couldn’t fix my gps unit. I shipped it to them and they promptly called and said it could be fixed by just replacing the lcd screen for $245+ shipping.  I got it back in about a week and it works like new.  Thanks Hi-Tech!  Great doing business.  Paul</review>< Name>

<text>Awesome service. Cracked the touch screen on my Honda Accord. I didn’t think I had any other option than going to the dealer and paying $1,200. I ended paying less than $300 with Hi-Tech.

Sent in the radio from my 2009 BMW 528XI.  I was having trouble with the display in the car working, and the dealer diagnosed it to be the radio as the cause.  They also quoted my $2300 to replace!  Shipped unit to Hi-Tech for repair.  Got a prompt response and very reasonable quote for replacement ($225).  Upon return, the display still didn't function properly, so I called them up.  They said I might also have a display problem and asked if I could reship the radio to them and include the display.  I did. Again a prompt reply.  They indicated that their replacement unit had an issue, my display was fine and they were shipping me another radio, along with my display, at no charge for swap or reshipping charges.  I am getting ready to send them a unit from another car for evaluation.  Great, great experience!</Review>

I am not one to normally post reviews but the service I received from Hi-Tech and Bijan specifically went way beyond my normal expectations.  He was courteous and most knowledgeable and took the time to deal with my issues on a cold call.  It is a pleasure to encounter such professionalism in a world where it seems a forgotten part of doing business.<//text>

Thank god for Bijan and the crew at Hi-Tech. We bought a used Lexus, within 30 days the stereo and navigation system went out on us. Naturally the warranty didn’t cover the luxury goodies in the vehicle.
Lexus quoted us nearly $10,000 dollars to have the whole unit replaced. From everything I’ve read, they take the stereo out, ship it back to Japan, fix the faulty part, and then sell it again as a new $10k unit.
After spending the last year without a stereo system, we finally found Hi-Tech. Today, just a week later, our electronics are back to how they should be. For less than $1000.
Everyone at Hi-Tech has been friendly, helpful, and genuine. It is easy to see why they have been in business here for over 35 years. Dont go to the dealership to get your car electronics fixed, come straight to Bijan!<//text>

<text>Hi-Tech is seriously the BEST and most knowledgeable group I've ever dealt with when it comes to my car.  I live in Minnesota and sent them my amp rather than deal with anyone locally.  I trust them and Bijan is wonderful to deal with.  He's always there if I have a question or problem.  You MUST give them a try.< /text><rating>5< /rating><GmapID>0x80c297587e296ff1:0x991abe2f2c5195e6<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

{'time': 1566008669887, 'text': 'We are sorry that you felt that way. Every unit that we fix comes with 6 or 12 months warranty and if it is not repairable for any reason we would do full refund so there is no scam. After any repair, we keep the units running 24 hours for quality test before shipping them back. If customers have any problems or questions after the repair, usually it is resolved over the phone because most of the issues are related to the installations or programming afterward and if the problem can’t be rectified, we would send a return shipping label to send the unit back for warranty repair.\n\nMr. Taylor C. sent his navigation unit for repair which had no display. His unit was fixed after installing a new mother board and we advised him that after installation he might need to have the unit programmed by an authorized dealer. Two months after receiving his unit he claimed that he had no audio in his car, we tried to call him couple times to help him over the phone but he never answered our calls so we sent him an email explaining the required programming procedure after installation in order to get the audio back to work and we even sent him a return shipping label to send the unit back for warranty repair or refund but he finally sent an email saying that he has sold his car and he did not have it any longer!!\n\nWe have been in business since 1986 and every single day we receive emails from people around the world not just USA, and not just our own customers thanking us for helping them with their sound and navigation system issues because we believe in “Do to others as you would have them do to you”.'}<//Response>

<review>Total scam. I sent him my head unit to fix and paid $600 for nothing. The head unit did not work when it was returned. They would not respond to me when I reached out for help until I filed a PayPal claim against them. I would avoid at all costs.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Porsche 997 with PCM not working except once in a blue moon...Bijan was able to trouble shoot, remove, repair and replace the radio without scratching anything inside and using a delicate touch through out the whole process. Also have a Denison that he was able to salvage. Also fixed a fiber optic line he determined wasn't fitted tightly when first installed 5 yrs ago. Excellant service for us Porsche OCD owners. Radio replacement was market value and like brand new. Labor cost was dead on for fixing my issue in a day.  BY THE WAY I DO HAVE THE BOSE SOUND SYSTEM...and Bijan made it his b@#$h! PCM issue fixed for basically half of the cost of replacing head unit with an aftermarket radio and having the Bose Fiber Optic Loop exchanged to make them work together. Definitely better than buying Aftermarket radio from over sees to mimic the OEM look. NUFF SAID FOR ALL YOU PORSCHE HEADS RESEARCHING A SOLUTION.  JUST GO HERE!</text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I had a problem with my Lexus radio and CD Changer.  I got a quote from the dealership to replace them and it was much more than I was willing to pay.  I searched online to locate a place where I could send these units.  After speaking to a technician, I was comfortable in sending my units for repair. It took approximately 2 weeks to get my units back.  When I received my units, the radio was not completely fixed.  I phoned the company about the problem and they guaranteed their work.  They supplied the shipping label so that I could send my unit back.    This time around they worked on my unit right away and I received it in a week.  Their customer service was Exceptional.  I paid more than I should have repairing these units, but I am VERY Satisfied.  I would highly recommend their service.</text>

My cluster lights went dark a few weeks ago, and I did a lot of research to find someone who could fix it for me.  I came across Hi Tech and gave them a call.  I spoke to Bijan and set up an appointment, The service was fantastic, he had Moji work on my car and in 3 hours had it all done. There price was the best and their service, second to none.  Thank you Bijan and Moji<//Text>

I was somewhat leery about sending in my factory Shaker 500/6-CD changer to this company that I never heard of. The reviews were good, so I decided to try them. I was more than pleased with the service and attention I received. I sent my unit via UPS so I know when it arrived. The very nextday I received a quote and decided to go ahead with the repair. To my surprise, the radio was repaired and shipped back the next day. Talk about fast service. The repair was excellent and everything turned out fine. I will not hesitate to recommend this company to anyone who might need radio/CD repair.<//text>

< Review>
Repaired navigation unit for 2003 Lexus LX 470 for several hundred dollars when dealer said it would be thousands. BTW, it's located under passenger front seat. Quick turn around.  Gave me information over the phone and instructions on how to take out the unit, and called when it was repaired. I brought my unit to Kinkos and they packaged and shipped for me.  At Hi- Tech electronics, I spoke with the individual (Moji) who did the work! How refreshing to have old-fashioned service again. Really feel confident about their knowledge base. If you own a 100 series Toyota Land Cruiser or Lexus LX 470, and you are particular about your vehicle, I would trust these folks.<//Review>

How in the heck do I even start to rate this business and Bijan... A freakingmazing maybe!!!! I had the dreaded dead Audi Q7 MMI caused by a bad Bose amp. Bijan helped me troubleshoot my problem over many weeks, once diagnosed I shipped the amp out to him, I received it today (4/5) and I am back in business.  I was to the point of giving up.... I truly want to thank you Bijan for your amazing customer support, you really are in a class of your own.  If anyone is having Audi MMI issues, call Bijan at Hi-Tech before you do anything.

Thank you guys!!! (My children also thank you guys)</text>

<review>Hi-Tech is fantastic.  All of their people are friendly, knowledgeable and just overall frankly amazing.  I needed replacement needles for my car's instrument gauges; they replaced them within several hours at an inexpensive cost with perfect results.   I imagine the dealer would have charged at least three times what they did, perhaps more - and not have been so pleasant about it.  Consider Hi-Tech first if you have any instrument gauge or navigation system issues with your car.  Five stars, and thank you to Bijan and everyone at Hi-Tech!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Time>

I had a 2015 Toyota RAV4 that had a $2,400 radio that wouldn't work.  The dealer tested it and said it had a "broken head unit".   That's the top part of the two piece radio assembly.  The main board was defective.  They wanted $1,100 to replace.  I found H-Tech's instructions on how to remove the unit.  Sent it on Wednesday, they got the following Monday.  They called me with a $684 cost to fix, I had it the next Monday and installed it myself in 10 minutes.  Works great!  Love them and their videos.  It was a DIY project.< /Text>

<Text>2014 Toyota Rav Radio CD/system just stopped working the screen went blank. The Toyota dealer quoted me 3,000.00 for new system and $1,800 for a rebuilt one, not including instillation/labor
After speaking with three or four shops, I Found HI-Tech Electronics Services in Van Nuys, CA.  Spoke to the technician who was knowledgeable about the issue (Gave me instructions on how to pull the system out).    Sent to CA, and  two day after High-Tech received it I got a diagnosis. System needed to be replaced with a rebuilt one.  The cost was a fraction of what the dealer and others quoted.  Received my new system in two days (Newer Model with a NAV component)  while Installing the system I ran into a few issues but, tech took my call and walked me through it, no problem. Works Great so far  (has a  1 year warrantee).

This guys are better than any electronics repair shop I know.
My Audi Q7 MMI went black. Nothing was working, no sound/audio/video...nothing.i took it to Audi and they were asking $2650. I didn’t have that money to spend.
I called Hi-tech and told them about the issue.He instantly told me what the problem was. It was my 5F. That’s the brain of all MMI. I followed their directions and pulled out the 5F ( Navigation/CD unit). I sent it to them and within few day, the fixed it and shipped it back to me for $485.
I plucked it back in and booooom...everything came back to life. I couldn’t believe it. They saved me over $2000.
You can’t go wrong with this guys.<//review>

Just spoke to Mimi about repairing a Toshiba Blu-Ray player with RCA outputs for which I’m unable to find a replacement. I think it only needs an adjustment of the disc tray which is probably a very simple fix. She said they never repair Blu-Ray players because they’re so cheap to replace; she would not allow me to speak to a technician just for quick advice. It was very frustrating indeed!</review>

I had a problem with the command system on my 2005 Mercedes E320 CDI.  I watched the you tube video on this system and ordered a fiber optic "lollipop" from Hi-Tech.  With some very specific recommendations over the telephone with their technicians,  I was able to troubleshoot and fix the problem.  This was after a mis-diagnosis from two other Mercedes technicians at the dealer.  Instead of spending $$thousands, the fix cost me less than $50.  The technicians at Hi-tech are experts on the workings of the Mercedes Command Unit with the fiber optic connections.  Highly recommend!<//Review>

Highly recommend, quick repair, priced exactly as advertised way better than others, even impressed by how much cleaner the radio looked and the return packaging was impressive.<//Text>

<Time>1399591757358<//Time><review>Horrible customer service.  Stood in the lobby for 20 minutes without being greeted. The $45 "DEPOSIT" is non-refundable.  The quote they gave me was $100 more than two other quotes. When I said I wanted my device back, they told me it wasn't ready and that I would have to come back tomorrow.  So I have to take more time off from work to pick it up tomorrow.   HORRIBLE COMPANY!!!!<//review><Response>{'time': 1402103760053, 'text': "Mr. Bevis brought his Ford radio for repair on 4-7-2014 and paid $45.00 (a non refundable diagnostic fee) which we have a big sign in our front customer's area showing that. Our technician checked his unit same day and called him same day with an estimate of $155.00 which was very reasonable, he said he would call back which he never did and we called him couple times to remind him after that. On 4-15-2014 he finally called back and said he found a similar unit which he could bring so we can take the part out and repair his other unit and asked for a discount. Considering that we have to spend more time to remove the part from the other unit which is more time consuming, as a courtesy we agreed to do that to help him out for $95.00 instead of $155.00 . He never brought the other unit and on 5-7-14 almost one month after, called to pick up his unit which it was still disassembled and waiting for his decision, so we asked him to come the following day to pick it up which he did. We are very sorry that Mr. Bevis felt horrible about our company since we always do our best to accommodate our customers but we can not work for free."}<//Response><userid>104265879172999583873<//userid>< rating>

Great company. Found them on the internet. Took my Lexus Navigation reader to them after the dealer wanted $1800.00 for a refurbished one. Bijam had to replace the PC board, cost me $650. Took it in on Thursday late afternoon and went in at 3:00 on Friday to pick up. Bijan installed it and I am so happy to have my navigation back. Thank you<//Text>

These people are awesome.  They saved me from spending $2800 on my Audi A6 MMI controller box.  I mailed the faulty one to them and  they inspected it the day it got there and called me immediately to inform me that contrary to what the garage told me it WAS NOT BAD!!!  Charged me nothing for bench checking it and then told me how to trouble shoot the car further and explained how all the modules related to MMI run on a fiber optic system as well.  Sold me $40 loop connector tool to help me diagnose the problem and now my car is fixed(with out the use of the bluetooth) for $40.  Thank you very much!!  I wish the service world was full of business people like you!<//Text>

If there were 6 stars I'd have given this company all 6!  I had my 2007 Lexus IS250 Nav System touchscreen replaced and these folks were AWESOME!  I had been emailing Bijan for some time and finally got time to schedule a day to drive the Lexus up to them in Van Nuys, CA to replace the touchscreen.  They did an awesome job!  It took a couple of hours for the technician to remove the entire Nav-Radio from my car, replace the touch screen and put it back in.  Saved literally thousands of dollars over the dealer and it is now perfect.  Not only that, they are all very nice people.  I will be back for all my electronics repair needs!

If you are one of the millions of unfortunate Lexus owners who's Nav Touchscreen no longer works, this is the best (and possibly only!) option to ensure it is repaired and done correctly without breaking the bank!  Lexus wants you to replace the entire Nav unit for anywhere from $2500 - $8000!!!!  Rather than that, spend several hundred and have the screen replaced and done right!</text>

My new favorite Taqueria on I-5! I got a huge vegetarian burrito with fresh guacamole and tomatoes. I asked for spicy salsa inside and was not disappointed! But spice averse  beware! There were at least three cooked habanero peppers in my burrito. Delicious. Not the fastest but worth it.< /text>

<text>The food is AMAZING, all hand made tortillas for tacos and to use with menudo and birria. They also sell homemade natural fruit/veggie juice on the weekends which is also very good and good for you haha.</text>< pictures>

7-13-2017  Asada Chavindicas corn tortillas hand made. With every thing. So delicious

6-29-2017 My first ever Chavindecas. A double order. OMG this was good. Asada, onion, cilantro, cheese and handmade corn tortilla. Horchata was excellent.

6-18-2017 La Mira. Handmade tortillas. And they were excellent. Today three tacos asada with coke. Very good. Will definitely return.< /Text>

So now we have to wait for new pizzas to be delivered.. another 30 min... And nothing else. Not a sorry. Not a complimentary item for my boys. Nothing... Definitely the last time I'm ordering here. Back to dominoes I go...<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6AMl308Wc6QwzXmlFnENBZ1fwhnFgIIXSg0B6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

By far the worse pizza Hut I've ever had! The pizza was dry and the toppings tasted old. The boneless wings I ordered for my family barely had any sauce and the pieces were literally scraps. I'm never ordering from this location again. To top things off it made my family sick the next morning. I don't recommend this place at all.</review>

The Parker Road Pizza Hut is not good service. They do not deliver outside of 4 miles. I work in Fairfield and my office is 6.2 miles away from the store. They just lost a lot of business from my work.< /Text>

Ordered food and two hours later when I called to figure out where it was the staff said door dash picked it up. I didn’t order it thru door dash. When transferred to the manager, the manager could figure out where my order was. I not have to call my bank to cancel the payment. Will never order here again and will let everyone I work with to do like wise.</review>

<text>If people saw how filthy it is past the counter this place would be closed. The dishes are slightly rinsed off and thrown into a disinfectant machine for 50 seconds instead of being properly scrubbed and washed. Oven is waiting to catch fire with all this black fuzz built up on it like the oven is literally never cleaned. If Gordon Ramsay saw the conditions of this PH he would not be pleased.< /text><rate>1</rate>< user_id>

<Text>Its good though, but it would be much better with less salted cheese or plane cheese is used in pizza . Because it was loaded with double salted cheese.
Also more toppings need to be added.</Text>< Date>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>Today was only the fourth time I ordered from this PH.  The three previous times, I had a very good experience. I ordered online & then called with specific requests. Each of those previous times I was told that my request was not something they 'normally' do, but, my request was accommodated.  THANK YOU, Fairfield PH!!!
BUT  today I placed my order via the PH app & followed the car up with specifics as I do & have done.  Anyway, employee, "Ray", far under exceeded" all expectations.  BUT, during the typing of this review, I was contacted by the owner lady.  She is GREAT!!  addressed my issues, & I am pleased</Text>< pictures>

I gave 4 stars for the simple fact the teamwork here was very admirable the employee taking my order was clearly in training and I could tell he was doing his best and making sure to be as accurate and polite as possible and im sure i was more than a handful with my 100 questions on specials and all that but I could hear his team mate in the back telling him to continue with his good job and the manager confirmed his work a job well done and it was very pleasing to know how their employees are treated. Not to mention the pizza was pretty good the bread sticks were plain and hard though and the chicken wings weren't my style ( I got the dinner box or something) overall a little pricey fro what came in the box but great service.< /text>

Man the only reason I went there was I got a $10 large 3 topping coupon in the mail  they said it would have been $26.something WOW  I asked for beef onion & mushrooms. When dude showed it to me I said I wanted beef & he said it is . Got home put in mouth yuck nope sausage so there's the protein on my plate gone to the dog. The mushrooms & onions were cut from real big to real small & some thin to where over cooked half the toppings . Should have gone to my place  -New York Pizza Kitchen-  on N.Texas st. Fairfield would have been done right & it's less than $14. For a 3 topping artisan bread yum. Last time I tried pizza Hut at the Parker rd. Fairfield  location was about 2 years ago again coupon & on that side of town. Pizza was aright that time but after I payed dude turns around & his pants r almost down to his knees & so he has to pull them up. I don't know if he was trying to say that he's "open" or what. I had to told him no hold on u need to go wash your hands gonna touch my pizza after grabbing all down there right in front of the manager. Grow up & wear your pants like a man be professional & clean  your working & with food.<//review>

<text>This is the 3rd time we have ordered delivery from them and this will be the last time. They were AN HOUR AND A HALF late. I get that they are short staffed, but it is frustrating paying 50.00 for 3 tiny medium pizza and bread sticks, one being half burnt. One of the boxes was caved in. Never again will we ever be ordering from this pizza hut. We will stick with vacaville.</text>< gmapID>

This is the worst pizza Hut ever. The pizza is always mediocre sometimes nasty. They never honor any if the specials you see advertised which I understand they don't have to but still you would expect them to honor it some times but nope they sure don't. And last but not least they didn't have the ingredients to make any crust beside thin crust 3 separate times in a row just a horrible pizza place their are to many other options to be this bad.<//Review>

Amazing; it was on time, cheap, and the workers were nice. My only complaint is the location, being really far from downtown Fairfield and not having another Pizza Hut IN Fairfield.

EDIT: Friend tried delivery, because he lived near it. It did take forever for them to deliver. My opinion: DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY. If you get carry out, your food will be fine, so long as you pick it up on time.<//text>

If I could give negative stars I would. I have ordered time and time again with multiple messed up orders and keep thinking they might get right the first time. I ordered my pizza tonight with a delivery time of 30 min. 2 hours go by and my 7 year old who should have been getting ready to go to bed is still up waiting. I call and ask where my order was person on phone said it will be another 20 min. So I ask can o get a discount for it being an hour and a half late he says no. So I say ok than I want to cancel my order and you can just take the 35 dollar loss. And the dumb manager said ok. So instead of taking a 10 loss he took a 35 dollar loss.</Review>

If I could give it 0 stars I would. Just had an experience with a person calling himself the manager. He was rude, ignorant, and unprofessional. My question of what my wait time would be sent him over the edge to the point he was verbally aggressive and insulting. The customer service is appallingly awful.</Text>

<review>I placed a large order and was given a wait time as usual. 10-15 minutes after the wait time, I gave the store a call to be told that their driver was on break for another 2-3 minutes, then my order would be on its way. I waited another 15 minutes, to be told that the driver was just leaving and on his way. I don't blame the driver, but this store needs to get it's act together. 25+ min wait over the original wait time for an order without even so much as an apology is unacceptable.<//review>< response>

I HAD A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!!...NOT ONLY DO THEY NOT DELIVER TO MY AREA IN SUISUN, I ACTUALLY DROVE TO THE PLACE, AND NOTHING WAS WHAT IT SAID ONLINE!....AND THAT WORKER (HANNA) WAS EXTREMELY RUDE TO ME AND RUSHING ME TO ORDER, AND HUFFING AND PUFFING! AND THERE WASN'T ANY OTHER CUSTOMER IN THE PLACE!.... MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT THE OWNER IS GOING TO LOSE A LOT OF BUSINESS IF HE KEEPS (HANNA) WORKING THERE!!!!....I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!... And this thing is making pick a star in order to post my rating!...."0" stars from me!<//text>

Double whatever the estimated delivery time is that they tell you. Im no expert, but I don't believe it should take 2 hours to deliver a medium pizza, on a Thursday night.</Text>

Let's talk about Anaheim's husband and wife duo that cook some of the best Malaysian food in the region, entertain guests with ukulele serenades, and will deliver as far as San Diego! (Eat the World Los Angeles)< /Text>< Pics>

I was craving garlic butter shrimp, and thankfully, there's a restaurant nearby that serves a variety of shrimp dishes. The staff also was very nice to me and that made me comfortable ordering. Highly recommended!</text>

<review>Delicious Malaysian food. The Nasi Lemak Rendang, Maggi Mee Goreng, Sardine Puffs, and Crispy Pork are all so good. Great food and great service. Owner is a very nice man, provides attentive service, and cares a lot about the ingredients and the quality of the food. Worth the drive to Anaheim from West LA. Will definitely be back.</review>< pics>

<name>Blynn Vill< /name><text>It was our 1st time here one Saturday a party of 2. We can’t decide what we wanted so the owner graciously helped us. Many of their menu items were under $10. Everything we’re good so also ordered so much more to go. I like the earth friendly packaging. I would definitely go back for the Curry Laksa Noodles only available Friday & Saturday only.< /text></record>

I was looking forward to have some good Malaysian food. I was so disappointed. How can you go wrong with Nasi Lemak and Beef rendang. The beef rendang tasted like can food and overwhelmed the Nasi Lemak. It felt like I was eating rice with rempah. There was no Nasi Lemak taste to it. Char Keoy Teow was another sad story. Too sweet.</text>

<Review>Food:
Hainan chicken is amazing. Juicy and delicious chicken. Worth coming over to get a dish with rice.

Ambience:
Clean open and modern. Plenty of seats.

Parking:
Big parking lot, but be careful. Parking is tight. You might get a car ding.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3lZq2kf4RdMYoTfQ31V-PqQnFZPz3P86JWmo_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

<review>Seasons comes to my office periodically as part of a rotating restaurant catering service.

They are easily the best thing that comes. Everything tastes freshly prepared. I usually get the Nasi Lemak and coworkers get the pork belly, and everything is tasty, fresh and reasonably priced, and the staff are very friendly as well.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Best ROAST PORK and CHAR SIU in town. Roast pork is always crispy and flavorful, yet not too salty. Char siu is super tasty, yet not too sweet. Very friendly and helpful owners/workers as well. Free ukulele lesson every Sunday 3-5 PM! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</Review>

Best roasted pork hands down!!! Even better than sam woo in chinatown 😀. Perfectly crispy and so addicting. The roti curry was also delicious. We also ordered mee goreng and the stirfried noodles. Both were alright. Will definitely come back for the pork!!!!< /text>

I've been here in/off for years, most recently with a group. Good service; good/OK food. I'm not in love with this place as everyone else-- I just don't see the hype. It's fine really- I'd just much prefer to return somewhere in crazy about! :)</Review>

<text>I am a huge fan of okra/lady fingers and they hit the spot with this one - their food is traditional and filled with flavors.

If you like your chicken with no salt this place isn't for you.<//text>< date>

I love this charming restaurant! The owner is very friendly and even treated us with a song on the ukulele. I ordered the Char Kwey Teow and Pork Char Siu Soup Noodles (half Roasted Pork) and the owner recommended the Curry Roti. Delicious!

It was cool that there was a book and fun facts about Malaysia on our table and ukuleles hanging in the back. A little extra detail makes it that much more charming.</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Drool inducing pork dishes and friendly owners make this a must-try Malaysian restaurant in Orange County. I've been anticipating their opening for over a month and it was well worth the wait. Just listening to chef Soon describe his passion for the perfect consistency in the char siu makes you appreciate the artistic approach he takes in creating each dish. Anyone that takes that much pride in his work has my vote and business.

My current favorites are the Char Siu Pork, the Roast Pork, and the Bak Kut Teh. I enjoyed it so much I went back the next day to have the same dishes. You're just not going to find anything like this in Orange County.< /Review>< Pics>

This restaurant was amazing! My family and I decided to go here after another Malaysian restaurant we wanted to go to just closed for the day. Before eating here, we read the reviews, and they were amazing, so we were expecting greatness, and we were not disappointed!! The service was great, and the food was extremely authentic and delicious!! The roti canai was the best I've ever eaten! The owner even came up to us during our meal and he told us a hilarious Malaysian joke and talked about some Malaysian stuff. He even gave us some leftovers of one of the desserts there! Overall, the dining experience was amazing, and I definitely will come back here! It's in a great place too, right next to 99 Ranch Market and Daiso. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone craving something new to eat. Remember to try the roti canai at all costs!</text>

<Text>Food was delicious. And lots of it. I had a great Groupon so we came in for dinner. It started with a half and half appetizer of yummy curry with flatbread and chicken satay. We each got a drink. Mine was refreshing sweet coconut water and pineapple. Her the Michael Jackson. Rice milk with green jelly? I wish I could remember the names of our dishes. Pictures posted. Mine was rice with anchovies shrimp bok choy and fried egg. Her was noodles with fried tofu? shrimp. Either way both yummy. We took our dessert to go. Too full to finish there. The waitress was excellent. Friendly and helpful with the menu. I will not need a Groupon to go again. Just an empty stomach.< /Text></record>

This is a small authentic restaurant. All three dishes that we ate and the soymilk with grass jelly were delicious.   The chicken rice (basically rice infused with chicken broth) was moist and flavorful.  The staff was incredibly nice and attentive.  Looking forward to coming back and enjoy other dishes.< /review>

<text>We went there when they just opened. Everything is fine just the portion at the time was small. I had to get extra stuff next door at ranch 99. People usually don't want to do grocery shopping after meals. And I am 180 lbs.
Both orders came out small for the price at Anaheim area, also for Asian restaurant.
But everyone's pictures here look great after years. Good to know they have increase the portion.<//text><Name>Joshua Liu< /Name><Gmap_id>0x80dd29ec3f7e1459:0x4910db50bfaf785c<//Gmap_id><rate>4< /rate><user_id>117477855700892822125</user_id><Time>1548430021381<//Time><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

I haven't found Malaysian/Indonesian this authentic in SoCal anywhere. The place is sparsely decorated but the food and warm staff more than make up for the simple decor. Careful with the spice level, it's truly authentic, medium level may be more than spicy enough for the uninitiated. Also on Tuesdays they have an awesome ukulele group that gathers and plays songs. A happy restaurant that I hope stays open for years to come. A great place to eat when you get out of Disney.< /text>

<Text>I ordered a couple of food through ubereats to this Restaurant. I got one order incorrect. I called the restaurant and talked to the "owner" telling him of the issue. The owner of this restaurant has NO customer service skill at all. He told me that there's nothing he can do. All he can he said is to owe me something for the next order. Are you serious?! What if I will not order anymore?! There's no next time because of this mistake. He also added that it could have been the driver's mistake in packing the order. The driver has nothing to do with all of these as he is only the one delivering the food. In the receipt, they encoded the incorrect order which proves that its in their end that the mistake took place. During the entire conversation, the owner was so defensive and abrasive. I cant believe this type of person owns a restaurant. Worst of it all, this Malaysian owner, didnt even apologized! Despite the mistake on their part and the inconvenience, he didnt take accountability and apologize for the obvious mistake his restaurant did. Worst customer service from this restaurant that came from the owner himself. Shame on you!
Dont go to this restaurant, its not worth it!!!

Update: They sent a replacement for the incorrect food they've sent me after I insist. The employee that brought the item was someone I always see in the restaurant as I used to go there ALWAYS. SHe also recognized me. I told her that the owner was so rude. Poor employee, she has to apologize on behalf of the owner. She further added that the owner is so stressed out today and as a matter of fact, he yelled out to everyone today. Seriously Mr Soon TEOH?! You should be ashamed of yourself. What an unprofessional businessman<//Text>< user_name>

The food was pretty good. We enjoyed the roti canai with curry. The drinks, Malaysian tea & coffee, were yummy. The ice cream was great. The staff made it a wonderful experience. After our late lunch, we were treated to  lessons in a game and ukelele. Awesome time!<//review>

The chicken in the sauce that comes with the Roti was cold in the middle. The Roti was delicious though..... The noodle dish was extremely oily my last trip... The 4 times before quite good.<//review>

< Review>
Located in the same plaza with 99 Ranch and Starbucks, this restaurant is a hidden gem. My husband and I, we were planning to try this restaurant the weekend before, however, it was closed during dinner time due to private party. It was noted on Google, but we didn't check it, so it was our bad not them. Lol.
Didn't discouraged, we came back the following weekend. Boyz, this restaurant didn't disappointed us at all. From ambiance to service and what else? Food, of course.
We tried 2 appetizers which were chicken satay that came with sticky rice cakes and cucumber served with peanut dipping sauce. Chicken was tendered and peanut sauce was creamy and tasty. Next one was Roti Canai with chicken curry dipping also came with pan toasted flat bread. Very authentic and delicious. For entre, I chose Char Kwey Teow rice noodles. It was a combination of stir fried flat rice noodles with Chinese sausage, shrimp, egg and bean sprout. Kinda Pad Thai, however, I like this version better because it wasn't oily at all. Oh so tasty and yummy. My husband ordered its famous Nasi Lemak which was steamed rice in coconut juice served with curry chicken, roasted garlic peanuts, boiled egg, fried anchovies and sambal (a kind of mixed tamarind sauce). It got 2 thumbs up from him. Don't forget to choose medium spicy level for a kick. Last, but not least, a Happy Roti for dessert. Very unique. It was a blend of hot and cold, you'll get one scoop each of coconut pandan and jackfruit cashews ice cream on pan toasted flat bread sprinkled with coconut flakes. OMG!!! Soooo delicious, especially, jackfruit ice cream. Not sweet at all. Love it.
- Service was friendly and attentive. The 2 ladies servers were frequently checked on customers and refilled our water quickly.
- Most items on menu were under $10 and generous portions too.
Good food, good service, affordable price. We'll definitely be back to try other dishes soon.
- Do come on off peak hours to avoid waiting.< /Review>

<review>A little seasoning goes a long way.

Kalimantan cuisine is sadly underrepresented, in my humble opinion.  The bright, fresh flavors and tantalizing herbs are a treat for the palate.  Thusly, Seasons Kitchen USA has been bookmarked by me for a long time.  In Anaheim for the OC Green Expo, I took a quick drive from Center Street Promenade to Seasons Kitchen USA to see what they're all about.

Glancing through their robust menu, my eyes spotted curry laksa.  Laksa mee is my favorite bowl of soup in the world.  I've only had it at two other restaurants, previously, so I can't say I'm an aficionado, but when I saw Seasons Kitchen USA has curry laksa Fri-Sun only, I knew I found my pick.

Curry laksa-
Soup's on!  Differing from other bowls of laksa I've had before, this had a very thick broth, which had little to no coconut milk that I could spot.  The creaminess of coconut milk is what sets apart laksa from other Asian soup for me.  Also, Seasons Kitchen's laksa is prepared with flat rice noodles.  I much prefer ramen noodles (house-made, even better) for the chewy mouth feel.  The rest of the ingredients were quality.  The chicken was super tender.  I can say I enjoyed my bowl of curry laksa.  Unique from what I've had before & from what I was expecting, but good.  I find I still enjoy laksa mee made with ramen noodles, shrimp & coconut milk, moreso, though.

The popular menu items at Seasons Kitchen seem to be their Hainan chicken, pork char siu & bak kut teh.  I'll have to order those next time.

Service was fine.  Seasons Kitchen seems to be a fast casual eatery.  I didn't wait very long for my order to come out.  A good amount of tables for seating, I wouldn't recommend very large groups.

Parking is at the 99 Ranch Market plaza, which can be quite hard to come during the weekends.

Seasons Kitchen USA, I'm a fan!  Their mouth-watering menu, especially the pork char siu, has me salivating for a return visit soon.  I'm also fond of the free ukulele & guitar lessons every Tues 6pm - 8pm.  I can tell the establishment is run with love and I could use a Michael Jackson (grass jelly, coconut & soy milk) right now.

Highly recommend!

<review>The employees are very nice, the food is amazing, not much else to say!!!! I've never eaten Malaysian food before, the two girls working there explained the menu in detail with smiles. My girlfriend had the pork belly which was seasoned beautifully and I had the Nasi Lemak which was an awesome blend of spicy, salty and sweet. Highly recommended!!!!</review>< Rate>

<Text>The food here is delicious. I had the Hainan rice and chicken. The rice had a great buttery flavor and the chicken was very tender and equally delicious. We also had the rotti curry which was a great appetizer. They also had someone come by and sing us some traditional Malaysian songs during our meal. All in all a great dining experience. The food is also not pricey!</Text>< Date>

Quick service but quality yummy food! I go back every weekend for a good fix of BBQ pork with rice. Everything else on the menu is delicious, just depends on the mood. There's Hainan chicken or Bakute if you want something a bit healthier or curry with roti (soooo good) for when you want to go all out. Owners are really nice, prices are really affordable, and the quality is consistent.</text>

Good Hainan chicken. It's really most and tender and its the best Hainan chicken I've had in the OC. Cha Siu was just Ok. Roti canal was crispy and flakey with curry that had chunks of chicken meat.<//text>

Not much to say, which is sad considering the amount of money you’re paying for what suppose to be a quality pizza/wing joint! Pizza was bland, surprisingly small (with their $19 “Bigger” option). You’re better off with your typical franchise pizza place (round table, dominoes, etc). The wings were subpar at best. We ordered the saucy Buffalo wings ($14 option) which by the way wasn’t as described, didn’t even fit the bill of “saucy”. Last but not least ordered a pitcher of soda and they handed what seemed to be child size cups??!! All in all it cost a total of roughly $45 dollars! Not worth the money, wait, or time. If you’re a local resident and don’t want to go far to get a decent pizza, by all means eat here. I definitely wouldn’t recommend, nor will I be back.

Last note: It seems the place was also run by teens, at least the time I went in. It felt like they were disorganized and we had to ask for typical things like, plates, napkins, cheese/peppers etc. the overall attitude or impression I got was “blah” there wasn’t really an emphasis on customer service either, again my opinion. To each their own if you go eat here, you’ve been warned!<//Text>

Used to Be Good.

Hadn’t Been Here for A While, Very Disappointed. Ordered the “Bigger” for Five of Us and it Was So Far From What it Used to Be That We were All Good with 1 Slice. Extremely Greasy and The Taste was Unpleasant. I Won’t be Back. The Price Was a Bit Much and $.50 For A Cap Full of Ranch is Insane. Especially When Other Just Give it To You. Good Luck</Text>

We love their saucy buffalo wings, as well as their pizza. We order the same thing every time and it's always delicious. 😋🍗🍕</Review>

The hottest wings on the menu are insanely hot. I could only eat 5 before i was brought to tears. Had to eat pizza in between wings so I didnt get overwhelmed. The pizza was good too. They delivered to my semi truck at the rest area :).
Honestly the delivery was missing ranch sauce and the driver was kinda incoherent.< /Text>

<text>I ordered pizza and bbq wings to be delivered...it was delicious! They use high quality ingredients and it shows. Delivery was prompt and courteous. I can also recommend dining at the restaurant. They are a family owned business that really cares about the community and has excellent customer service. Try them, you won’t be disappointed!</text>< Pics>

Super friendly and great family atmosphere. Food was very good. We ordered boneless wings and a pizza. Wings were not greasy and the pizza crust was tasty. Only complaint is portions are small for the price. Maybe eventually they will have specials and happy hour.</text>

<review>Arguably the worst wings I have ever eaten. WAY too salty. Even the "Morton Salt Girl" would pass on these wings. It was the Chipotle flavored wings. The restaurant was slammed and I didn't want to send them back. I should have got the pizza. The people next to me were enjoying the pie.</review><Gmap_id>0x809107b61cdc0ec5:0xdc219e39a37c30d2< /Gmap_id>< rating>

The ingredients were great quality. The crust was a little thin but good flavor not as crispy as I would expect for as thin as it was. The  parmesan in the jars for dine in customers was real not the powdery cheap stuff. We liked everything we ordered. Friendly staff.<//Text>

Ordered a pepperoni pizza, wings and drinks. Pizza was good. I personally felt it needed more cheese but that's my personal opinion; to each his own. The wings were ok. Sauce on wings (Buffalo) was good. Having to pay for refills on our drinks was a negative especially since it takes time for them to bake/bring you your pizza. We were greeted and attended to nicely. Overall we had a nice experience but definitely taking a star away for the charge for drink refills.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>They charge for refills on soft drinks. I don't appreciate that. It is not what I expect when I go out to eat. In fact, I cant think of another restaurant that does this. They also have several employees working at a time, even on days that arent busy, but you still have a hard time getting help.< /text><user>111830151524763142691< /user><Rating>1<//Rating>< Pics>

I know we're a little different, but I had to make a hard choice based on  the chaos of after school.\nWe do our best to be fair though... if you order a $2 24oz soda with a $1 refill you get 48 oz of refreshment for just 3 bucks. And a pitcher of soda sold for $4.50 is 54 oz with ice served on the side. That's enough for more than 3 of our 24 oz cups so definitely a good deal for bulk soda buys.\nThanks for checking us out though K, we always appreciate that!"}< /response>

Nice atmosphere but I won't be dining here again Pizza took forever I understand they were busy but come on a dollar for a refill on a fountain drink nobody does that fountain drinks are free refills everywhere unless you go to the mall especially a pizza place when they say 20-25 minutes and it turned into 40 minutes waiting and they want to charge a dollar for each refill I'm good... they're already making enough when I pay over $50 for a 2 pizzas and wings and then they want to tack on dollar refills... definitely never again.<//review>

Music was a little loud but not anything crazy. So glad they have gluten free options because my mom and brother have celiacs disease. I love that they have a clean water faucet that you can help yourself to. I forgot to check if they had wifi but that would be great if you guys did! Very cool what you did for a Good Shepard Lutheran church, my family has been going there for years.< /text>

I had high hopes for a new pizza place so close to my house.we walk down there we were greeted nicely we ordered pizza and wings.they brought us our drinks very quickly but then the pizza took quite a while to come and the wings took even longer. two of us and already finished our sodas before food came and then I asked and found out that refills on sodas were not free but we're a dollar extra.we ordered 1/2 combination half pepperoni pizza which was only slightly better than Costco's pizza except that the pepperoni had maybe one to one and a half slices of pepperoni per slice.outer crust of the pizza was very very good but at the centre it was rolled so thin that it just drooped and was almost non-existent crust in the center.I'll probably wait until they've been open another week or two and give them another shot maybe it will be better second trip.
I've gone back for a second trip, and things were much better. Plenty of pepperoni and no droopy crust. Still not a fan of paying half price for soda refills, but had a discussion with the owner and see her reason for charging for the refills.< /Review>

I understand that the kids from the nearby schools make it hard to offer free refills; however you should make some type of exception, such as offering free refills on orders of $20 or more, or making free refills available after 5pm and on weekends. This practice would help bring more returning customers and return more frequently. People don't like feeling that they are being nickeled and dimed, it's a huge turn off as a customer.<//Review>< pictures>

We support them in all areas of their lives, encourage them to be their best selves and to acheive their goals even beyond Willie's. And though we've only been working together 4 months, we have deep bonds. Don't feel bad for anyone who works here, for they are all awesome people... artists, activists, college students, moms, dads, atheletes, and overall badasses.\nI am proud to say at Willie's we make our own dough, chop our own vegetables, grate our own cheese, and make our pizzas (and much more) from scratch.\nI stand by our food and our employees."}< /Resp><userid>116266971374989930739<//userid><text>Very bad customer service. Took a very long long to even have the food. It wasn’t fresh they also have a very high discrimination rate. They have poor African American women who has braids and they told her she had to take her braids out! California has become the first state to BAN discrimination on natural hairstyles. I don’t understand why the manager said she had to change her hair routine. I wouldn’t even give them one star if I was given that choice.<//text><date>1562534917263<//date><name>Stephanie Castro<//name><pics>None<//pics>< Gmap_id>

Litteraly Little Ceasers tops this place . The cheese tastes like rubber & everything is way over priced . Save your taste buds and don’t waste your money on this place .</Review>< pictures>

Quick service. Staff is always friendly, respectful, and very helpful. And they have cheap used quality tires if you are on a budget. The only negative thing is that is cash-only.< /Review>

< Review>
This was my first time adopting a dog from a shelter and this place was excellent at helping my fiance and I adopt a dog. They have a gated area where you can interact with the dog your interested in so you can get a good sense to how the dog is and the staff provide great information about the dogs temperament.

Although their adoption process is slightly different because of COVID, the amount of information they provide to you about the dog you adopt is fantastic. They microchip, neuter/spay, provide medical records, and vouchers for health exams for the dog you adopt! The adoption fee seems reasonable for the amount of information they provide. Would adopt from here again when my fiance and I decide to adopt a second dog.<//Review>

The website and the phone operators are awful ! Not only did i wait 30 minutes for them to pick up the phone but they hanged up the phone twice! The website has very minimum information that self explanatory and also the "Find an Animal" in the website doesnt have all the animals listed and I'm not allowed to be to specific on the website because it will show no results. Also very understaffed which makes it difficult to contact for help! Should also put on the bio of the website that to drop off animals in the shelter is open 24/7 instead of saying that it will take a hour for pick up of lost animals because I waited till 9am said they will arrive in a hour and didnt show up at all! I had to take the animals myself. They were extremely starved and had a broken tails with cuts on their arms and hands  but extremely friendly with humans but aggressive with other animals.</review>

Clean shelter with a lot of dogs and cats of all ages. Dogs are outside with big cages that are part covered  and part not. They also have heaters which is nice. Moat of the dogs cages were clean, other than those that recently went. Dogs seemed to be happy and in good care, though some appeared to have a cold. The kitty ward was a big garage space with many cats and kittens. Staff was friendly and helpful. Worth checking out, will rescue as soon as I can<//review>

They were very helpful to my husband and I. They gave us supplies to foster two kittens until they find a family for them. We were taken care of right away and the kitties were taken care of you right away we took them home after they got their medicine and flee treatment.<//review>

Came here almost a year ago and adopted my little Polly (formerly "Flower"). If you're looking for your next baby or a new companion, this is the place to go. I would urge you to consider the older/senior animals. My dog came totally trained. She knows to go outside to potty, she's very good on a leash, and hardly ever barks. Even when we take the train together, she'll fall asleep in my lap. I highly recommend that you talk to the volunteers. They know these animals better than anyone else and can tell you about their dispositions. I think the lady that I talked to was Kathy (or Katie?). I told her that I also had a cat at home, so the dog had to get along with cats. She was able to take my dog to the cat area and hold her in front of the cages. Obviously, it went well. Also, if their ID number is highlighted, that means they're gonna be put to sleep soon. I just want to tell Kathy (or Katie) not to worry about this little girl! I'm making sure she lives her best life possible, and I can never imagine life without her.
If someone got rid of her just for being too old (she's too well behaved to have been a stray) they messed up because I came up on a wonderful dog!< /text>

<text>Adopt DON'T shop! There's so many beautiful & wonderful dogs & cats in here who are in need of a good home! Breaks my heart seeing them all like this. This shelter has a friendly staff always willing to help & answer any questions you may have. For the most part, the cages are always clean. They have their vets around, which is great. The atmosphere for ME personally is depressing cos I'm a huge animal lover & seeing all these animals like this makes me tear up when I can't do much about it. Once you adopt an animal from here, it'll be with its shots & info. Overall, a good animal shelter & I urge everyone to come look at the wonderful animals & give them a forever home. They more than need & deserve it.

Would give 0 if I could. They led me to believe that I was first on the list was adopting a cat when they gave me an appt to go see the cat. Turns out someone was before me and I drove 1-2 hours to adopt a cat I thought was going to be mine only to see it get adopted to someone else. Why didn't they just tell me that someone else was first instead of misleading me and having me drive an 1-2 hours for me watch the cat be adopted by someone else? In short, do not go to this place if you're trying to adopt because you probably think youre going to adopt the animal when you're really not.</text>

Very fast, easy, and friendly experience.

I took my little fur pup to get licensed. This has been my first time licensing a pet, so my expectations was to be here for a little while to wait in line, and complete paperwork.

To my surprise, there was only 2 people ahead on line, and the licensing process was extremely fast and easy. I was in and out in less that 15mins. Very pleasant experience.

Tips: If your licensing, have all the proper documents ready (neuter/spayed, and vaccinations). This will speed up the process<//Text>

I love how Baldwin shelter finds all their pets great homes. They are really respectful and they help families find the right pet. We got a kitten, we got to interact with him and adopted him that day. There is always a right pet for you. And remember to adopt don’t shop. ❤️</Text>

I dont know what these other people are talking about this animal care facility is clean and welcoming. The staff are also very helpful and friendly. I'll admit that since the Covid crisis they have had to change their ways for the safety of the animals and staff so it's a bit frustrating but hopefully they'll be back in form when this is all over.< /review>

I adopted a 1 year old female Chihuahua today. She was so clean, spayed, chipped and shots! The service was excellent! I recommend to go on their website, jot down the number of your future pet, call and go in. I do plan to get another Chihuahua,  lol!< /Review>

Would like to give this place negative stars if I could. Extremely rude staff and unprofessional. Was listed to adopt a kitten and called two days before and then a day before and was told “congratulations he’s yours. Your appointment is tomorrow morning at 8:30” show up for appointment and he had been adopted the day before, before my phone call with them. Meaning the cat had been adopted before they called me to let me know he’s mine. Very very disappointing and not ok. No apologies given or anything. Very angry.< /text>

For an animal shelter it's one of the better ones in Southern California . Lots of dogs barking whining animals look sad like they know their going to die here. The volunteers are really helpful and will answer questions about the animals . The shelters employee's are another story their there because they get a paycheck with the exception 1 or 2  they don't care if your dogs lost and your looking for it people drop off lost dogs/surrender their pets if that animal gets luck it make it to a kennel to possibly get adopted about 1 out of 10 dogs leave a California shelter alive . And they call them no-kill shelters<//review>

Very clean shelter but people if you can't handle the animal don't get it ... There were no puppies I went to rescue a puppy but I seen so many Pit Bulls it was just sad please be a responsible pet owner an know what your getting into it could be a very long commentment depending on the breed of the dog an hey what's with all the Guinea pigs there there were how many Guinea pigs and some adorable little rabbits you should really check it out if you're into that kind of thing but please those of you who by pit bulls just because they're cool be responsible some of them do get big some of them do get aggressive if you cannot train them right I have had 3 pit bulls in my lifetime and they were all adorable animals with no issues whatsoever I just train them and I treated them like I would any other dog and they were perfect you just gotta know what you're getting into there are very high energy dog so if you're not high energy I don't recommend a pit bull for you just think about it this way if you're a lazy man get a basset hound if you're a skateboarder or a surfer or some either likes to jog get a pit bull they'll be able to keep up with you but please be responsible< /Text>

<Time>1581390577786<//Time><review>There's a lot of noise going on. Dogs need love and maybe more greenery. Volunteers are all amazing! Employees kinda act like the job is just a paycheck to them. Not happy office environment at all. Lines are always long. You would think they'd be trying to get animals out the shelter faster without hoops to jump thru. It is one of the better looking facilities though. Heater was broken when I went too. Dogs were sweating balls in their kennels in area #1<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c2d78d07a8154b:0x70f4812fcd5318fc< /Gmap_id>< name>

<Review>My girlfriend and decided to rescue this adorable dog as our first pet together. We knew he had some medical issues and drove 400 miles just to see him. After seeing him, we fell in love. Concerned about a small fracture in his hip and an upper respiratory infection and ear infection, we chose to go to the vet before taking him 400 miles home. The vet took xrays and it showed he had two significant fractures in his hips causing them to be significantly displaced. They kept him in a kennel for a month with no pain meds with two horrific breaks that needs immediate surgery. The vets even fell in love with him and offered to try to find a way to keep him from being euthanized. Poor dog needs a miracle because this last month in their care has been cruel to him. I'm just grateful that he is not going to suffer anymore and at least will have pain meds if he does end up getting put down. Now for this 400 mile drive home with heavy, broken hearts.

Update: I heard from the vet that, upon further tests, the dog had a small fracture in one of his hind legs and a third fracture of his pelvic bone. They were amazed he was able to walk at all with the severity of the injury. The medical staff at the shelter told me that he would be fine with bed rest and the small hip fracture would heal on its own over time. Either they were misinformed by the vet they work with or they blatantly lied and failed to disclose important medical information to me while not providing proper care of the animal while he was there.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg9i_QYggAeoo10ffXGqpFRT1gR3UFxF8W-ELA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBUug1-iNzYYM16I6FYKNWIS1c0wTmXzx31hVt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIZETGCAzf-_pc_8--nFCRUM5ANPIoClyhzJU5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5HvGJLCELf5k_q48NOjNUz3qWA6JCxR8eRvDg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzd3DPZ1h_kzzyhOD9CJ4NQC8l3Kz947xyf_4P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Time>1541068911739</Time><rating>1<//rating><text>On July 7 I adopted a beautiful German Shepherd by the name of Jasmine! She was a little bit animal aggressive and I had to return her to the shelter. Today July 13, I called the shelter to see if she was available. They told me “yes she’s available come on down we close at 5 o’clock“ My mom wanted to adopt her. A beautiful home, a beautiful backyard. And by the way I found out Jasmine loves to swim, and it just so happens there’s a beautiful pool! When I returned her, I told the behavior specialist that she was a one person dog, possibly a couple however, probably not around children or a lot of other animals. I personally owned five German Shepherd‘s! This dog is absolutely beautiful, and is a wonderful dog my mom wanted her as a companion and of course as a protector. What I mean by protector is to bark when there someone at the front door, let her know if somethings going on. My mother is 84 she’s alone and she would love that dog the way dog should be loved. That dog has been there since April 23. Almost 3 months in those tiny little cages. No wonder the dogs a little aggressive towards other animals, can you imagine being in a cage like that with all those other animals in there! So we went and bought the dog a Tempur-pedic bed, a ball and some other indestructible toys from Costco and of course the water bowl and food bowl etc. when we got there they told us that we were not allowed to adopt her that she’s going to go to a rescue! A rescue? You have somebody here that has no other dogs, is a woman by herself that would love the dog senseless, and would love her back and you’re telling us she’s going to another shelter? This is absurd! That should never be tolerated. You’re going to send it to a shelter instead of sending it to a loving home? What are they thinking? That’s unacceptable! It’s not only intolerable and unacceptable it’s just flat out stupid! She has a beautiful home and a beautiful backyard and Jasmine would love it!  Jasmine likes to swim and needless to say she would have a beautiful pool to do it in. Please help save Jasmine! Any calls or responses to the Baldwin park Humane Society would be greatly appreciated.It’s not fair that they’re denying that dog a loving home and sending that dog to another rescue, that’s just not fair! Jasmine deserves a better life and we can give her that. My mom fell instantly in love with her and her heart was broken when they told her that they were sending her to another rescue! That’s insane and that’s just flat out stupid when you have somebody that truly wants that animal! Thank you! Erin and Joyce.

UPDATE: We adopted Jasmine! Thank you Mr Rodriguez and Officer Figueroa! She’s a great dog!! We love her very much! She’s so great with my mom and she’s very good with kids! She’s a great addition to our family and my moms home!< /text>< pics>

Our family pet was stolen then he returned home christmas night... We were happy our 7 yr old daughter immediately bonded with "max" our husky like he never was taken. She couldnt wait to get home from school to be with him. One morning the gate was left cracked open and he went out and was picked up by bp animal control. We had to gather enough money to get him back home (2 days). We went to get him they determined he was ours by seeing us with him and him responding to us. Our daughter was not with us at that time. We were asked to bring pictures of him as a puppy and any recent pictures as well and if we could do so we could take him home. My husband went home got the pictures and our daughter. She was so happy we all were. Then after showing everything they asked for we were told he was microchipped and we couldnt take him home. Our daughter cried so hard she couldnt breath. Why put us thru this BS IF U NEVER INTENDED ON LETTING US BRING OUR MAX HOME? Our daughter has had breakdowns in class and still cries for him. We miss and love you Max. So sorry you are not home where you belong 💔<//review>

<Text>I can not stand this shelter this is where I picked up my cat and my cat had caught kennel cough while he was in there and nearly died which in return gave it to all 4 of my cats and nearly killed them all they offered no meds to restore them back to there normal healthy lifestyle. So just a word of precaution they are dirty and you just might come home with a very sick animal .wishing you all the best of luck with your cuddly new addition to your family.

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>It was my first time visiting this place and the employees at the front desk were so rude. They offered me no help and would rather talk among themselves instead of helping people walking in. I waited for 30 min to get help when there where three employees at the front desk and one other person ahead of me. The workers who actually oversee the animals (who I think were volunteers) offered me help and answered all my questions. They seemed to care about the animal's needs more than the other employees.</Text><time>1570084521903</time></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Seemed nice. The cats area was cool cause all the cages are on a curved wall so all the cats can talk to each other. There was a very sweet older cat I wished I could have adopted but my current adult cat would not have been okay with that.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>I am writing this review in great hope that it will shift the consciousness of anyone that is considering dumping their animal at an animal shelter that euthanizes animals. I know that you are probably thinking that someone will adopt your pet, or that some fantastic rescue group will step in and save your dog just in the nick of time. How I wish it were true that every single animal that sits in a kill shelter would be saved from taking their final breath waiting for a forever home that never materialized.
If you truly love your animal and can’t keep them for whatever reason, I ask that you do everything in your power to find them a loving forever home. As a volunteer at an animal shelter I can tell you that the most beautiful, loving, trustworthy, friendly animals in our communities are losing their lives there, don’t fool yourself into believing that they only euthanize feeble old animals, everyone is fair game, and everyone needs to be moved along to make room for the new batch of animals that are constantly coming through the shelter doors.
The shelters will tell you what can we do? We have no choice but to euthanize, this is a problem created by society, we’re cleaning up their mess by destroying these animals. Shelters will continue doing business this way. It’s up to us as citizens to step up to the plate and take care of our animals until they are old, there isn’t a day that goes by that they don’t give us every ounce of love that is inside of them, they run to the door to happily greet us when we get home from work, they cheer us up on our saddest days, and they are happy to share every minute of their lives with us. Don’t turn your back on your animal and betray them by dumping them at an animal shelter that kills animals.
Sincerely,
Patty Jackson< /text>< Pictures>

They said I will probably have to take him to my own vet to take the stitches out. I agreed and said I understood and waited for my appointment day. They called me several times before my appointment date to make sure I wanted to adopt because if not they had other people interested— sounds weird to say but I confirm and say I’ll be there I want to meet him. They call me on my appointment date to cancel. He’s still in the care of the private vet and they’ll call me when he’s ready. The next day I missed their call but listened to the voicemail. The woman that I had been talking to, Santana said call me back I want to speak to you about the condition of the kitten. I call back, ask for her, was told she was not answering but the best she can do is email but it says here you can only come get the kitten today or else they have 3 other people that are coming tomorrow. Kinda rude. Now I’m wondering what happened to this kitten it was just supposed to be surgery on the tail. What exactly is the situation I’ll be walking in to? I have about 30 mins to get ready and then a 30 min drive to the shelter. Not exactly the closest place to go waste my time at. Anyway I get there and explain the situation and it’s that Santana girl at the window and she goes oh ya the kitten is super sick it’s not doing too good are you sure you wanna adopt it?? Honey what the hell do you think I came all the way out here for? I say well I’d like to see it. Duh. At least let me see and decide. She closes the window, I wait, she comes back with a waiver, I start filling it out ask for another waiver because I had my friend with me and before I finish that sentence she closed the window on me again! When she finally opens up the window she says yeah so if you’re not gonna adopt him you can’t see him cuz he’s too sick. And so I left frustrated feeling dissuaded for the entire experience and never fully communicated with. If they had told me hey this kitten is not adoptable at the moment because it needs more care for multiple conditions— I would have been like ok thanks for letting me know. Instead and I don’t know why but they kept asking me if I really wanted to adopt him. Why would I call and say yes I’m interested in adopting this kitten if I wasn’t actually interested in adopting the kitten!? Idk man they’re rude and not helpful. Horrible experience, would not recommend. I hope that kitten finds a good home.< /Text>< user_id>

Love this place and I even love how they redid the painting outside and everything! We found our baby boy here and he’s perfect as can be! Just a reminder when you get a dog from a shelter any shelter they always come with kennel cough so just be aware if you have other dogs in the house! But other then that this place is amazing.</text>

VERY HIGH KILL SHELTER :( Half the staff are rude and shouldn't meet with the public ... the other half of the staff are absolutely wonderful. Trying to speak with upper level mgmt is a joke bc you're just passed around to different people and you'll never reach the head person! They could use a staff shakeup in this place to get rid of the obnoxious and extremely rude employees and bring in staff who actually care. Animals seem well cared for but individual kennels are small. I didn't see any play areas for the animals so I'm assuming animals r kept caged. Many of the animals held there for long periods turn aggressive after being there too long. The staff who care for the animals, feeding, etc., seem to be sweet and caring. Animal kills, seems excessive but I'm told shelter is usually full and kill is needed to accommodate more. It's sad there's not enough community support/volunteers to help turn this shelter to low/no kill.</text>

< Review>
When we went to adopt everyone was friendly and nice.  However the dog they let us have had the worse case of kennel cough which turned into pneumonia.  She was so very sick she wouldn't eat.  We spent over $700 to try and get her better, but she did not respond to IV fluids/antibiotics, etc.  and had to be put down.  She was the sweetest dog.  This happened within two weeks of us adopting her.  I tried to get my deposit back but was told by a really rude employee that it would have to be reviewed.  Over a month later and still have not heard anything.  Be sure the animal you are adopting is healthy enough to fight off kennel cough, because they will get it upon arrival at this shelter.  Wish I could say better things, because I think there are some nice people that work here.<//Review>

I’ve been trying to adopt a puppy for over a year and have been given the same line each time, there’s already 3 or 4 people ahead of you, even though the puppy has been there past their initial intake and listed as available for adoption for almost a week. I also referred a friend to go adopt a specific breed she was looking for and she was given the same run around, she eventually purchased the puppy instead. I’m ready to give up on adopting a dog from the LA County Animal Control.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< name>

Fast, and  friendly. I adopted a cat went pretty smooth hardly any wait time. Cost was $13 for a 7 month cat for the month of September. Cat was neutered and microchiped and had most of its shots,  I'm glad I went this route.< /Text>

Tuesday March 10th 2020 I am in my room in a home in Baldwin Park with a three-year-old feral cat sequestered in the cabinet built-in above the walk-in closet. Baldwin Park County animal thing sent me home on Saturday with a feral cat, which was found on March 2nd my cat was lost on March 4th the feral cat was found by them in Baldwin Park my cat was lost by me in El Monte the feral cat is documented to by them at 3 years old and has a strong very muscular robust frame size, my cats are one-year-old there are four of them females unspayed they are delicate petite, at one-year-old resembling teenagers rather than  kittens for adults they are not bruisers like the one we are hiding from in my room right now. I went on Saturday to look for the cat I lost at the spay clinic at the El Monte mall they showed me a room with a cat in it that very closely resembled in mine it was difficult to tell because the anesthetic was affecting its responses when I held it though I have reason to believe it might be my cat I also felt that it was not my cat but I thought I will be helping a cat in need, so I said this is my cat I would like to take it home the checkout process seems to have been aborted because the cat I was taking home could not now be checked out out as a Lost Pet so it seems the cat had been it had been checked in as feral cats stray status and those kind of cats do not have owners coming to get them so the girl said to me don't say anything I can't make the system print out your papers so I'm going to process it as an adoption okay when anybody says anything just say adoption I didn't care I was hot I have a heart condition I wanted to go home with my cat. When I got home with the cat all cats hiss at her they hissed at my cat . I can see now clearly that this is not my cat she's a Bruiser she's 3 years old she's beat up she resembles my cat's in no way whatsoever I will not return her to that location because I believe that they will  extinguish her she and I got along very uniquely and nicely when we met at the shelter but it's clear that she and my cats are not going to be harmonious I was once involved in a violent attack by my cat because of the presence of another female cat and the experience was sudden shocking unexpected and irreversible I had to  give that cat away that night I couldn't trust her anymore  her Jaws had latched onto my forearm and I can still feel the weight of her as she was  trying to yank me and I was trying to flail her off ,  I believe cats might be able to be assimilated together I cannot try that because of run experience  it can also be dangerous and fatal  so in my room n my room are all female cats the cat that's feral cat sequestered above is a is a female I don't know what to do I'm not asking for advice maybe yes I am I don't want to return this cat there because I want it to live but I cannot absolutely cannot keep it how can I have been permitted to leave a facility with a animal that they designated for reasons clear and documentable to themselves as a feral stray cat and I come in and say my cat is a home cat but that cat is my cat they missed on the dates the cat was missing and the locations the cat was found and the size and weight of the cats so the entire experience was odd in a way I couldn't put my finger on now I have a very clear understanding of why everyone who works there is so ready to sidestep something unnameable and on seeable there weekend emergency 24-hour staff suggested after saying they did they didn't know what to do that I try to farm the cat out on a Facebook or Craigslist I didn't ask him but does he mean should I say I have a great a three-year-old feral cat who looks like a bully and does this weird thing or should I say none of that and try to farm her out that way and if this does not also found a significant or important or serious enough to you because it does to me why was I not contacted by management because of the contents of my telephone call I called them again today the call was dropped halfway, I would have thought as an employee to contact<//review>

<Text>Edna, an animal care giver, was extremely helpful when we rescued a mother dog and her puppies. Edna was calm and patient with the anxious mom and showed she truly cares about the well-being of the dog. Two volunteers also helped and the three of them made a great team. We’re so appreciative of the kindness shown to the dogs. In the front office, Rachael Castaneda helped us with our paperwork. She was efficient and friendly. She must enjoy her work because she smiled constantly and was sure to explain everything we needed to know.
I understand that working with animals and the public can be stressful, but Edna and Rachael are the most professional and caring people I’ve met at that shelter. Thank you!<//Text>< Pictures>

We got an incredible dog at this terrific, no nonsense shelter.  It's not complicated.  Pick out your canine (feline) soul mate, get him (or her) fixed. Go home. The vet was particularly nice.  If you need help, try asking one of the employees in the kennel  which animal is their favorite. That's in the kennel, not the office.  We got someone we didn't plan on taking home, and he's perfect.<//text>

I think I was purposely given a Sick dog. Every dog  I asked about wasn't available. Why do they have dogs there that aren't available? I got a  Chihuahua mix and within 24 hrs I noticed she had worms. Within 48 hrs she ran away. She was turned in and  When I went to pick her up at the shelter I was told they would have her checked out , but when I got there they said they don't do that. Everytime I tried to pick her up she tried to bite me. I decided to surrender her and go to another shelter. So disappointed and frustrating. 😔<//text>

I was looking through animal shelters and I come across this puppy that I feel in love  with, I  know we will be best friends. My mom said I can get a puppy for my birthday and she will be ready May 4😍. And my Birthday is May 8.She is my best wish that I ever wished for. I cant wait to see my 1 month old baby girl😇🐕💕. I dont have her yet but i wanted to show anyone that these dogs change your life. When I saw her profile and started crying. I said to myself "She needs me".😘 Please come here and adopt a pet.🙏 Young or old they need you.💞.<//Text>

The girl at the front right side of the desk had a serious attitude problem and I had to ask for a supervisor who listened but didn't help me with anything either. This place is completely disorganized and they only care about your money not your pets records etc. They misplaced my pet's rabies certificate and when I did take it they didn't even look at it. Also, I've been mailing it every time my dog is due for the shots, because it says on the remittance a copy can be mailed but these folks are throwing it out or something because they had no record. Someone needs to organize this place ASAP. Missing records, employees are misinformed etc.</Text>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>If it wasn't for officer Martinez this place would've gotten negative stars if i could. I found 4 kittens by my job. Trying to do the right thing. I took off work early and took the kittens to this center. And they was talking about i had to take them to a different center the opposite direction of my house. I informed the female officer that i can't   take them out of my way to Downey. She tried to say i was abandoning the kittens. I thought taking them to that center would get them help. Then she called officer Martinez and he came and i informed him of the situation. He stepped away for a little bit and returned with a nice lady from im guessing the ASPCA i think next door. She gave the kittens food and accepted them. Just trying to do the right think and help abandoned animals out and they was trying to say i was abandoning the kittens at an animal center.  I almost canceled my donations to the ASPCA. But it wasn't their fault.< /Text>< pics>

The people there are rude and not very helpful. They have dogs that are “rescue group” only and will not let you adopt unless you use a rescue group. Then they give you a giant list of rescue groups that are not willing to help you. I ended up having to use a lady from Washington to get the dog out I wanted. So ridiculous. Seems like they want to put dogs down to me.< /text>

Leaving this review specifically about Rachael. She was the most helpful, understanding and sweetest employee at the Baldwin park shelter that I have EVER encountered. She helped us adopt our beautiful black boy cat and made our day. I would definitely return because of her. I've had bad experiences at this shelter in the past which made me reluctant to go back but I'm glad I did because Rachael helped more than I could have imagined! Rude employees, take notes , this girl has the right attitude and gives excellent customer experience!< /review>

Our dog had run away on a Saturday. We were able to find her thanks to their website. We showed up to see about picking up our dog 1st thing Monday morning, the entire staff was very helpful and friendly. We were in and out in less than 30min. So glad we were able to get our Luna back. Thank you all< /Text>

This Shelter is well maintained and all animals have enough room to move around. They are very watchful of anyone that comes in and request for any type of service. The people attending the animals are carful not to hurt or stress them. The only thing about this place is that they do not keep to date the age of the animals. In display it would be about 2-3 years younger then what the official paperwork says.<//Text>

<Review>I'm a very loving and caring person towards animals, dogs in particular. So I went in to this shelter since it's very near home, at first everyone was very nice when I said I wanted to go in and visit the dogs. While I was looking at the dogs I was so disappointed to see most of their cages were dirty. Is no one cleaning after these dogs? There were flies all around. It's very hot out there and I was glad to see them all in the shade and have plenty of water for them. Some of these dogs on the other hand had no food in their plates and scratching looking for food.
There was one dog in particular that I really liked and wanted to have the chance to take out to the little play area so I went inside to fill out the necessary forms. The woman behind the counter someone would be outside of the dog's cage waiting for me. Well as I walked over there I didn't see anyone. I waited for over 5 minutes and no one came by so I went to ask and said someone would be with me. Ten minutes went by and no one came.
This place needs better staff that are available to help these dogs find a better home. And someone to give more attention to them while they are here living in these conditions.</Review>< Pics>

I found my Husky (Santos) at  the Baldwin Park Animal Shelter.  The Shelter took excellent care and had sent him to their hospital in case he needed medical care, he did not, but they thought he did because he has a limp.  However, the limp is due to nerve damage.  Anyway,  Santos was so, so happy to see me and I was happy to find him. Thank you Baldwin Park Animal Shelter for taking care of Santos😘< /Review>

Terrible customer service,  rude staff & poorly maintained kennels. The attendant at the ASPCA tent before entering the main office was very polite & compassionate other than that the experience was appalling. The customers in lobby had to tell each other to take a number. The staff basically laughed at someone who had lost a pet. They scolded a good samaritan bringing in dog treats & ice bags to keep the dogs cool in preparation of the heat wave. The woman I dealt with was rude & unprofessional.  I was there half an hour after they opened so the lack of customer service couldn't possibly be because of an overworked or tired staff. We attempted to walk the kennels but my daughter's pleaded with tears in their eyes that we leave after seeing the urine & feces infested kennels. Poorly maintained facility. It is impossible to get anyone to answer the phone either. These people are not caring of animals or humans for that matter. Horrendous experience! They don't deserve the 1 star rating, should be 0 stars.</Text>

This shelter is 1 hour 20 min away from my home and after a long drive I was disappointed to see that only 2 staff members were working the front desk.  One seemed like she didn't know what she was doing and the other was extremely rude and cranky as she said she didn't feel good. I waited in line 20 minutes just to be able to socialize with one dog.  I had to go back in line and wait what seemed like 30 minutes to view the second dog.  It took so long just to be able to socialize with them that I gave up on viewing the other ones.  The cages had just been cleaned and it was nice to see volunteers trying their best to care for the animals.  They should have one line for visitors who want to socialize with the dogs and another for visitors needing to complete other paperwork. All in all, the good news is that despite the extremely long wait to view the animals and complete the necessary paperwork to adopt and despite the rude front desk staff...I did adopt 2 adorable Chihuahuas.  Its unfortunate that the front desk staff does not make the experience more pleasant. I've been to other shelters and had nothing but pleasant experiences there..Hopefully someone can talk to them about getting an attitude adjustment. Either way, please ADOPT! :)<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Thus shelter helped me with my dog. Very kind employees that came to pick up my dying dog his cancer and Tumors came back he was in pain suffering. Mr. Fierro and Ms Gutierrez handled him  with such carefulness and consideration he didn't even cry out.we had to put him down.My son and I are so grateful to them for their kind words and actions in taking him to be put to rest.it was one of the hardest decisions we had to make. But could not stand to see him suffer in pain and unable to walk anymore. God bless you all for the great work you all do in helping All animals find new forever homes.Thank you Mr Fierro and Ms. Gutierrez you have a tough job picking up all types of hurt lost sick animals.We appreciate you very much.Ernedtine Robles an son Paul.</Review>

We got a number like how we were all suppose to & the front lady (I didn't catch her name) was extremely rude & didn't show any enthusiasm to make us feel comfortable so we didn't ask any further questions. She was on the right side of the desk & is African American. We will come another day when someone else can help us.</review>

<review>This place was packed full of animals. They had dozens of dogs, cats, rabbits, and even some pigs. Almost every dog was extremely friendly. This is because the aggressive dogs are usually euthanized  first. I met so many adorable and we'll behaved pitbull mixes that I wanted to take home. Unfortunately, I could only save one.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<text>I got my cat here and she's crazy but that's OK with me lol. She's healthy and happy and growing up just fine. The staff was super nice and extremely helpful.  They enjoy what they do which helps because the environment is very bleak. Despite the inherent sadness that comes with these places you can still feel the love that everyone has for these animals and that is why I am giving it 5 stars< /text>< pictures>

<Text>So sad, majority of animals do not get adopted and are subsequently put down. We went and found an awesome dog but could not meet her outside her pen because she still needed a temperment test. Went back a week later, still not done. Went back two weeks later and were informed that she could not be adopted because during her temp. Test, she did not react well to other dogs, but did pass with flying colors in all other areas of testing. Despite having documented that we were looking for a mostly inside dog, had a fence and no other pets on our application, we were still denied. Offerred to sign a single dog ownership waiver or anything we could think of when talking with the manager and they wouldn't budge..< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Worst customer service! My sister and I found a dog and turned him in to the Baldwin Park Shelter. I put my name on the list to adopt him and I was the only person on the list. We kept calling to check on the dog and visited him a few times. Saturday was his adoption day; so, we called to make sure we can go adopt him but they informed us that he wasn’t quite ready and they would contact us in a few days. Today, I checked the website and he wasn’t listed on there anymore. I called the shelter to check and they said they adopted him out already. After so much back and forth with the shelter, how could they adopt him without contacting us, who were the only ones on the list? So unprofessional and careless.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>I was first on the back up list and was told to call at 7pm the day the dog I wanted was available to see if the first people went to pick him up and if the dog was available I can get her the next morning. I called at 7pm and the dog was available but was told to call back at 8pm just in case the system needed time to update, reasonable. I called at 8pm and the dog was still available I got all the info and was told if I am there at 11:30 the next morning the dog is mine. I call AGAIN at 9pm to make sure because I’m so excited I just want to double check and yes the dog is available and she is all mine if I’m there on time. Come the next morning, took a day off work, get there at 11am just in case wait for about 45 minutes to find out the dog was adopted the day before.... what?... I called 3 times to make sure and I was promised the dog. Turns out whoever was working the night before was too lazy to do their job and decided they didn’t feel like doing the paperwork or updating the system until that morning. Even though by that point there were already 6 people on the waitlist all told to call that night for this dog, and I was told it only takes a few minutes to update the system. They tell me this, completely their fault, and I don’t get so much as an apology. I got a shoulder shrug and they moved on. They didn’t care at all. At the very least I feel like I should have gotten an apology after taking the day off work getting so hopeful and excited, getting my family excited and I pretty much just got a too bad for you from them. People are waiting and getting their hopes up and relying on these people at the shelter. If they can’t do their job and can’t take the couple minutes to update the computers they really shouldn’t be working there. If you’re on a waitlist for a dog and you’re not the very first person don’t believe anything they tell you and don’t get your hopes up until you physically have the dog in your possession because they really don’t care enough to give you proper information and don’t care at all if someone gets hurt because of it. Their “not my problem” attitude said it all.<//text><rating>1< /rating><UserId.>108814908770990314274<//UserId.><username>Jasmine Rose< /username><Gmap_id>0x80c2d78d07a8154b:0x70f4812fcd5318fc</Gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

If I could speak to someone about the way the run things here I would sue. They know how to make money around here, they wait last minute to tell you can pick up your dog and then say "oh no you can't cause of this this and this." I been waiting over 10 days for my dog and now they say I can't get him! Now they have me waiting over the weekend to speak to someone!!! So they can continue charging us. Freaking BS, so fed up with these emotionless employees. Just want to pick at their brain and see what the hell is wrong with these people. I understand any job can be tiring but you don't have to be so dead and rude. Can't stand when they just talk and walk away from you. Free my dog!!!!! From this stupid prison!!!</Review>

<Text>Honestly,  There is no doubt that many animals go un rescued here because of the incompetence at this so called "animal shelter".  Our Chihuahua passed away so I took my son to the shelter to rescue a dog's life so our dogs death would not be in vain.  We found a dog we liked and were told to come back the next day between 3-5.   Well we did that and was told the dog we liked had "kennel cough".  After waiting a half four to see the dog and speak with an attendant.  We decided to adopt the dog anyway.  Another wait in the Friday afternoon line.   The lady at the counter told us that the neuter was not performed because the dog had "kennel cough" and that we would have to take the dog to a veterinarian within 24 hours!   We were willing to pay for the dog, we were willing to take a sick dog, and buy the prescribed medication but the rest of the red tape was too much.  They could have saved us a trip by calling me and telling me this, after all I left them my name and number.   Time, gas and a life wasted because of the bureaucracy and incompetence.  A man left angry prior to my turn for the same reason.</Text>< Pics>

I'm grateful for the rescues that come and pull from this place! I have been going to this shelter almost weekly to adopt. I review the website for potential dogs to adopt, then go look at them in-person, stand in an incredibly long line (with 1-2 staff working the insanely long line), all to be told various reasons the dog(s) I am inquiring about cannot be adopted. The system is AWFUL. So much time wasted. I am really trying to adopt from a high kill shelter to truly "save" a dog, but it has been so frustrating. The facility is so gross. I don't know how often they clean but its not enough. Many dogs are sick. The staff are ok. A little rude but I cant imagine what it's like working in those conditions, so I dont blame them. And to those  that live in this community- stop buying/breeding pitbulls!!! They all end up here. There's probably 80% pits, 10% chihuahuas and 10% everything else. Horrible!!< /text>

It is IMPOSSIBLE to get a pet from this place. Excuses after excuses, gone here multiple times and requested several pets, nothing each time. Can’t get them because they haven’t learned multiplication yet< /Text>

Glad it turned out the way it did, but here's what happened.

1. Came on Sunday to adopt, found a dog online and wanted to interact but I was told they were short staffed and could not take the dog out to socialize. Came back on Monday and the dog was gone

2. On Monday, I interacted with a dog and was ready to adopt. Went back into the office to start up the paperwork. They then told me I could not adopt that dog because they just found out it was surrendered to the shelter because it bit someone...

3. On Tuesday, I came in and saw a dog I wanted to interact with but could not because it was on medical quarantine...in the same building as the rest of the dogs... I was later told this dog would be available on Monday of the following week

4. Came on Monday to interact with the dog. Even though the medical quarantine was lifted I was still not able to interact with the dog because it was still on a microchip hold. Was told to come back tomorrow (Tuesday)

5. Came back Tuesday, interacted with the dog, adopted the dog, happy with my dog.

To finalize, I had a very odd experience trying to adopt but in the end I am extremely happy with my dog. Not blaming staff or the facility because I know they have TONS of work and they were very nice and helpful to me, but I could've saved a lot of time if things were a little more organized. Just giving you guys a heads up that it might be a little more difficult than you think so be patient and don't rush your pick.</text>

<Text>Came back here after about 4yrs. They've greatly improved the place. When I had first gone here about 12yrs ago it's was smelly and  all the cages had tons of waste that's was piled, it was pretty bad and the staff were rude on top of that. Now that I went yesterday the staff seemed friendly, I spoke with a volunteer and she was very kind and I spoke with one staff member I believe and she was friendly and informative. The cats were indoors luckily and the dogs actually had heaters. Almost all the cages seemed pretty clean. I was happy to see about 20 people in line for what I assume was adopting. I hope this place only gets better and please understand that even with the negative reviews, your brief moment of annoyance will be saving an animals life so please adopt and always get your pet fixed. Hoping to come back in two days to adopt a new family member :)<//Text>< response>

Bad experience, they promise 2 or 3 people the same dog and have you come around just to find out that it is already gone, or it is been pick up by some else. It breaks your heart once again, please change the way of doing things and retrain your staff, they need to be more sensitive, and learn to be multitask.< /Review>

I am one of the many people who networked on Facebook today, 3rd July, to help save Victoria, a beautiful lynx point Siamese only two years old. We were told that Victoria would be available for rescue until close of business today.

Once the rescue plan was in place with adopter, foster and transport lined up, we were informed that Victoria had been killed in the morning.

The shelter knew very well that we were working to save her and someone was about to turn up at the shelter to pick her up. Naturally we can only assume that they chose to kill Victoria to save themselves filling out forms before they went off on holiday and possibly cleaning out cages over the holiday weekend.

Several people have been deeply upset by this monstrous lack of respect for people's time, nerves and feelings.

We could have been working to save a cat that was still with us and in need of rescue rather than one who had already been killed for no good reason whatsoever except it was less trouble.

Shame on you, I hope you have the worst holiday you ever had, and that the rest of your life isn't any better.

Sorry if this seems harsh, but where was your pity for this beautiful innocent creature who had no one any harm and didn't not deserve to have her life taken away from her at only two years old.

May God punish you as He sees fit, but I personally hope it will be an extremely harsh and horrible punishment.< /text>

< review>
Baldwin Park  ACC has an abnormal amount of dogs and cats for adoption. It would appear that locals do not spay or neuter and many let their animals roam. They do have a fostering program so if you are interested in making a difference or cannot afford a dog or cat of your own please sign up to be a foster parent at Baldwin. Fostering means you take the dog or cat, puppy or kitten into your home and look after it as if it was your own but you need to be prepared to give it to an adopter when the time comes. I've fostered over 40 cats and kittens and it has become a part of my life. The shelter normally pays for all the vet care and the foster parents pay for food and litter. Fostering frees up cage space and dramatically cuts down on the number of animals being euthanized due to space constraints. Baldwin does not mention on it's website whether they have a Trap, Neuter and Return (TNR) program for stray cats, they need to have one, most well run shelters do. The stray cats are caught, neutered, vaccinated and released back into the neighbourhood, they do not reproduce due to being spayed or neutered and therefore the stray cat population will drastically decrease. Volunteers need to ask Baldwin to do this. Maybe crowd fund to pay for the spaying and neutering.<//review>

<text>I went to adopt a kitten on tuesday but they said she already had a potential adopter. I called again three times on Wednesday to see if they still had the kitten and they told me they still had her up for adoption. I was also next on the list to adopt the kitten. I got in line the next day on Thursday before they opened the doors and I went in and asked about the kitten. They said she was already adopted on Wednesday. I can't believe the three people in a row lied to me that she was still there. Worst experience ever. Don't bother calling you'll be on hold for at least 20 minutes.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>In my experience employees and volunteers are working really hard to help people locate an adoptable animal and walk them through the process.  It's my understanding this is a kill shelter so heartbreaking to know some may not make it outta there to a new home.  Very clean facility and animals appear cared for by staff and volunteers especially.</Review>< pics>

< review>
It is seriously concerning how bad customer service is in the front office. Like I’ve never seen such cold hearted people. Specifically one person there by the name of KARA ( first or last name I don’t know it was on her shirt). She acts like she’s the boss there and has a rude attitude. I’ve never in my life experienced such an ugly personality like hers, at least fake being nice for god sake your working in customer service it is a part of the qualifications and requirements to get the job! Someone should really keep her on check or sergeant should really evaluate his workers skills because it’s absurd! There was an officer, a bit short and blonde hair she was nice and respectful so thank you for that, also there was Nancy who brought out my dog also nice thank you!!! Being a part of law enforcement I think it is part of our jobs to be the example of what others should be like in regards to being respectful and displaying a good attitude. Please someone do something about the shelter employees, we need true animal loving and good people for these jobs.< /review>

<Text>Hate that this is a kill shelter. The cats seem more pampered than the dogs sadly. I adopted my dog parker from here,best decision of my life. It'd be nice if instead of killing the animals,they'd give them away to a rescue place. You're government funded,you got money . Make something for the animals that don't get adopted, give them a chance. It probably costs more to.inject them than to.hold them more until they get adopted.<//Text><name>bambi m< /name>< Date>

The customer service here is the absolute worst.  The ladies at the front desk are no help at ALL.

I came in to check on a husky I found had been hit by a car to see how it was doing.  I was hoping to help find it a home even though I myself could not adopt it, and they were completely unhelpful.

They wouldn't let me see it to take some pictures of the husky, they wouldn't give me information on how much time it had left (this is a high kill shelter), and they wouldn't even let me put my name down as a last resort in case the dog was next in line to get put down (it's injured, and those tend to be put down first).

They basically told me adopt it now or just leave, and were completely unsympathetic to my efforts to help save the animal even though I myself am not in a position to take it in...  The front desk ladies lack any professionalism, are really slow to answer and help the people in line, and they show no interest in doing the minutiae of their jobs.  They have a serious staff problem here and should fire their asses and bring in new people.< /review>

<Review>They need to work on information of the dog, the sign always say available but when you go to the front to get they tell you the dog is ready to be adopted by someone and it’s so  frustrating because every time I go to the desk to adopt a dog, THE LIST IS FULL! like PUT A SIGN IN THAT SAYS THE LIST IS FULL so I don’t have to waist me time looking at a dog I’m not even going to get.< /Review>< user_id>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I feel sorry for the people who have to work in this place.  When the temperature is 100 degrees outside for a solid week, they are sitting in reception sweating because there is no air conditioning.  Whatever genius designed this place created a doorway that opens half the wall so any cool air escapes.  I suppose the winter isn't much better.

Despite this, the staff were patient and pleasant.  Everyone seemed busy and I was asked twice while walking the kennels if I needed help.

Having said that - this place is disgusting.  I think they need more staff because its dirty, and its not because the staff isn't busy or caring.  They seem very overwhelmed.  Every kennel had poop in it, and clearly haven't been thoroughly scrubbed since who knows when.  I visited 2 days in a row and it was the same condition both days. Lots of poop and pee.   The dogs are living in filth in sweltering heat - all panting.  Too hot to move.  Miserable conditions.<//Review>< pics>

Working at the shelter is a thankless job. The staff is not there for humans, they are there for the animals. Kissing peoples feet is not their priority. They want responsible people who are going to adopt an abandoned pet. I had my eye on 2 dogs. The Gold Retriever had bitten someone and was not allowed to be adopted at that time. The Lab/Shepherd mix got to come home with me right away.  There was no hassle what so ever. Actually it was quite quick in my opinion as I had never adopted a pet before.< /text>

<review>First off, I’m glad they take in sick and unwanted animals. Yay them!

However, the service is horrible! Not only do you have to wait for about 20- up to an hour but then the information they give you is wrong.

We adopted a dog that was supposedly adoptable and then it turned out she was just waiting for shots and to get picked up but her owners.

I love the fact that they house the animals but I really do think that the staff all need to be on the same page.<//review>< Rate>

< review>
Worst office staff ever. Waited over 2 hours on a Thursday just to get a dog license. My number poped up on the screen to be seen so I went to the open secretary, she then looked at me very rude and said she didn't call me and isn't helping me. I told her I just saw my number so didn't know what to do next and assumed I go to her since she was the next one open. She said she only accepted cash and when I asked her if it cost more that $43 since that was all I had in my wallet she said she didn't know since it depends on what city I live in and if it's spayed or not very rudely, but she didn't offer to help look it up for me since that's her job I didn't understand her rudeness so I had to wait for the other secretary to help me.  Then the other two secretaries went on breaks and when they came back were equally as rude. When it was finally my turn the woman asked if an officer went by my home and if that was the reason why I was there, I said no I didn't think so I just needed my dogs license, she said they did and was going to charge me $40 more. How can someone charge me a ticket if I didn't even have a ticket? At that point I was done waiting and just paid it. I then asked if next year she will mail me a renewal bill and she says she didn't know very rude once again just to mark it down in my calendar and go pay it there since the computer auto generates whatever it wants to. I honestly don't get it, if these secretaries don't like the customers or their work they should get another job instead of being there so miserable to everyone. What a bad way of doing business this place is.
The parking is equally as bad and overly crowded and a dirt lot.
I'd rather just not get a dog license and wait for an officer to give me a ticket next time since that's what happened this time anyways.</review>

<Text>I hate this place!! I've had issues with them in the past, they make it so hard to adopt, they are lazy. I am in shock that nothing is being done to solve the problem. I have been waiting 4 days for them to come pick up a dead cat that is literally in our front yard because we were dumb enough to pick it off the street and put it in a box so my kids didn't have to see it, figured i'll call animal shelter and they'll pick it up i should of known better.< /Text></record>

<Review>Everyone, it's not about "customer service." You're not buying a pair of shoes from Macy's. This is a living, breathing creature that you're considering to adopt to be part of your family. Focus on the life you can save and not the people who are paid to work there. It's not about them. Adopting my Floyd was the best decision I've ever made :) Don't shop, adopt!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Was not responsive made it difficult to file a complaint and I have the video to prove the neighbor had dog loose on my property in area at minimum back yard and front of my house 50ft plus from sidewalk. She lied and said her dog never is out. They accepted the neighbor's dog owner word not mine as her dog killed my cat. I had a Vet bill of over 1,000 dollars she would not pay. Slandered my name in the report too. So do not have much good opinion about them.<//text>

I keep seeing posts about this place on Instagram. They seem to be constantly putting down healthy cats and kittens! I read from one of the other reviews that this is a government funded shelter. Whoever is in charge needs to out that money towards building more cages and facilities for the animals and hiring more vikuvolunt to man the phones because on top of the fact that they are a kill shelter which I despise, they seem to have horrendous customer service which won't help get the animals adopted! sounds very poorly managed<//review>

I had to surrender my husky Gohan here and after reading the reviews I am very worried for his well being. The reason I surrendered him was because my current living situation wasn't ideal for him. I just pray someone will be able to provide him with a loving home.<//Text>

Thank you to the Family that surrendered Coco last Sept.-Oct....I can't imagine why you gave her up but know that she has a very loving family now.  She's a 3 year old chocolate/tan Doxie....beautiful dog with no training and I have a feeling that is why she was given up.  She's in a training class and is learning quickly that she is NOT the boss.  I would love to know more about her past and i"m so greatful to Dachshund Rescue of LA for saving her.<//review>

Unbelievable! I can't believe how obnoxious a couple of the ladies are. People who lack customer service skills should not be allowed to work at the front desk. It now bothers me to know that a portion of the license fees goes towards their salary. If you're waiting for your number to be called don't leave the area to help anyone. Because, if it is called, and they move onto the next one, YOU'LL BE told to get another one. And don't think I didn't see the smirk. Reflection of glass door, duh!  And that was just the beginning.< /review>

I went to the shelter to get a cat because the stray we wanted to adopt got claimed. I looked and asked for 4 kittens, but they told me they had respiratory problems. Which kinda sucked. So for your information most kittens that are only a few months old will probably be sick. However on my fifth try I finally found the cat I liked. I had to come on Monday (it was Thursday) because the vet was closed on Veterans Day. So I am still waiting. I picke her up on 11/14/16. :)< /Text>

Really bad customer service, worse than the DMV. Too slow and not friendly at all. The girl works at the front desk is horrible. I was waiting in the line for a while, but she skipped my number and called a person who just barely walked in. However, the facility is fairly well-maintained. Animals look healthy and clean.<//Text>

When we moved to this area. My husband and I decided to add to our family. What better than to rescue a dog from a shelter! We took our time and went to look and see if any of them caught our eye and heart. When we spoted him We KNEW! He DID too! He was soo wonderful! The perfect dog to add to our Family. A 3 year old dark grey PitBull.. With sweetest eyes. When my husband spoke to him he was so attentive and followed cammands! We immediately went to the front desk... Here is where it ALL BROKE DOWN!!...
First of all we waited for over a hour and a half. As we waited we observed the staff being rude and unprofessional to the people in front of us. When it was our turn. They could not find his info, and when they did they said he was a surrender and needed the chip removed before he could be released for adoption. We filled out the required paper work. Being that we had two Pits in the past. One for 15 years and one for 10 we are very familiar with Pits and were exited. They didn't call us for 5 days. When My husband called they said he needed to pass a "Temperament Test" which will take two weeks!  We couldn't wait and wanted to visit him. When we called to ask. We were informed he was put down. With NO reason. I AM beyond heartbroken. Why do they offer them if they STILL have to pass a temper test? Awful AWFUL PEOPLE! !!! WHY???  I have been going through the other reviews... Wow! They have a horrible track record! I want answers!
His name was Leonnituis..  And he was PERFECT in EVERY WAY...<//Text>

When calling to report an emergency with a stray animal, you would expect to be able to speak to someone within a reasonable amount of time.  So far, I have been on hold for over 20 mins, with no end in sight. In this time, the animal could have ran away, or if I was seeking medical attention for an injured animal it could have passed away by now.  For the walfare of stry animals in crisis they need to seriously improve their phone response time.</Text>

I was told by the rep, they don't pick up possums, to tip the trash can over and let the possum loose. What do these people get paid for?

<Text>These people are mean and rude.
Don't adopt from here.
Not to mention the short lines that take forever.... (about 1 hour)
It bothered me so much the way they treated me and my kids at the Baldwin Park Animal Shelter on Elton Street. I ran into a problem regarding adopting a baby kitten.
I was supposed to go to an interview to find out if we were ready to adopt a new kitten.
Somehow I knew that the woman tgat called me just wanted us to come in as a whole family just to humiliate us . That she just wanted to make us feel bad about the whole thing.  She had already made up her mind about what she was going to do. Which was to deny us of SAVING a Kitten
We went to the the interview and that animal shelter associate dressed like a sheriff,
The one that looked like a fat short hair red white woman. (I didn't get her name I'm sorry.)
She told me that because of what some associate in the year 2015 recorded on the computer said ....that he overheard a conversation that my son hits cats on the nose to discipline them.
Which is not true.
He doesn't do that.
So this condescending woman is going by hearsay.
I have to say that I had to return one cat because he was too wild.
And the other cat that I adopted 3 years ago from that agency died after one day of being sick.,
And they accused me and my kids of not being good to the cats.
What would you do if you were a cat lover and some A-hole Denied you and your kids the adoption. Not to mention denying the Kitten of having and GREAT HOME?
Can you write a letter?
Is there someone to contact?
And you know who is responsible for this?
A busybody volunteer white lady that is always there with brown wavy hair. Always EYE-BALLING THE PEOPLE TRYING TO ADOPT as If these cats were hers. What an A-hole!
She is supposed to want the kittens not be put to sleep (die) , Am I Right?
They were just on A POWER TRIP!
They cheated the poor kitten out of a good home.
And for what?
To prove what?
I'm sure they have a lot of anger against the people that abuse animals but....
They were Just taking it all out on me and my kids.
They claim they want the best for the kittens and dogs and other pets......but they don't.
But they shouldn't worry.... the Baldwin Park animal shelter on Elton Street..... because there are plenty of kittens running around my house that need a good home.
So I guess they're not doing their job rescuing animals after all.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

WORST ATTITUDE SHELTER!
Please Go To Hell!
Visited on May 9th, and had CTA on her and I was the only one on the list. Telling me the dog will be available for pick up on 11th due to her spayed. And I went there on 11th, now they were telling me the dog was gone on 9th. I really don't get what kinda bs game they wants to drag me into. Seriously ridiculous service. Just like the other guy's review on the bottom; "They know how to make money around here, they wait last minute to tell you can pick up your dog and then say "oh no you can't cause of this this and this."
I hope someone will go lawsuit on them about this, so fortunately they can stop playing games with us. Totally waste of Time+Gas+Expectations.
Their attitudes are totally unacceptable oh my god...
Buy my advise if you don't want to waste your time, and earn unnecessary stress from it.</text>

<review>I was very surprised on how the volunteers care more about the animals being adopted than the actual employes getting paid. There was a bald hispanic animal control officer who was very rude, kept giving me bad looks, and even followed me around the shelter. I went on 7/18 to adopt a dog and was told that the list was full and it would be adopted that day. Today, 7/25, I returned to see the same dog now sick, with Kennal cough, and green mucus that even had its nostrils closed. I went to ask about the adoption situation (since the dogs kennel had a sign literally claiming they didn't have enough space) only to be given a rude response and another story than the original excuse given the first time i inquired about the dog. I tried leaving my number because since the 18th I could of housed the dog, but the women at the front desk that's young with glasses refused to take my number down. It saddens me for these beautiful animals. I wouldn't adopt a dog here now sadly due to their discrimination that I have faced here, automatically being turned down for being a young male with tattoos.< /review>< Pics>

Adopted a cat that they told me had a respitory problem. Took her home without getting spayed, but payed for it to be done when she was better. Turns out she had a kitten. Had to wait several weeks for the kitten to be weaned off the mom. Called to have a rude ass lady tell me that I should have got her spayed anyways so the baby wouldn't be born. Who says that!? Who tells someone they should have just killed the kitten? And now they can't honor the spay. I payed forty bucks for them to be nothing but rude as hell. On top of that the first cat I adopted was shipped to another state the day I was supposed to get her. They are horrible, unorganized, and down right dirty.< /Text>

<Text>Spent a hour in line to get information on a pitbull that my family wanted to adopt, the rude unprofessional uneducated woman on the desk flat out in front of my kids it's no longer here it's been killed.  This particular dog my girls and i spent 1hour petting it through the fence.  As we walk away it would bark so we could come back and pet it again.  I strongly believe that the staff and society has given this breed a bad image.  La county need evaluate the staff and the unfair image they have on Pitbull.<//Text><date>1502839543606</date>< Gmap_id>

The sound of barking dogs could be heard a few blocks away. It was crowded as hell. Watch your tires for nails and broken glass. That place is a mess. Intake is a process but worth it to drop off strays.< /text>

<Text>Just in case you're there on a busy day, bring water and snacks for yourself, and if you're picking dog's to adopt take pictures of their id numbers and dont pick one make a list of at least 7 because some will be adopted already. I got here around 2, it's my first time here so I stood in line, people came and asked if I was there to renew a license, told them I'm looking for a for to adopt. They tell me where to go and i spend maybe 2 hours looking and petting all of the dogs and made a list of one's me and my boyfriend are interested in. Well we wait in line forever, which is understandable they're doing a lot there, they're busy with many people for many different things. We stood in line for 2 hours just to ask about what dog's we liked were available because we knee the puppies there would be taken but we wanted them anyways lol but after going through our list we finally get a dog that's available, now if you really want that dog, i would ask for alone time because we forgot to ask since we were busy being excited about our new girl. I've never been here before but if you ask questions and aren't rude with them they aren't rude with you.  It's simple. Just expect waiting because people are there to do their paper work too and other priorities may come.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2d78d07a8154b:0x70f4812fcd5318fc<//gmapID></record>

Adopted my sweet "franchesca" dog from there in June 2012 and if it wasn't for the help of a volunteer from an OUTSIDE source, I would have never been able to get her. This shelter is horrible as far as it's regular employees and customer service goes. AGAIN...if not for the volunteers who give hundreds of hours of their time to come in and try to save the animals there, then my assessment would be "IF YOU WANT YOUR UNWANTED PET TO DIE, JUST DROP IT OFF HERE!"  Don't EVEN bother ever trying to call and get a live person on the phone!  Please DON'T let the negative comments about the shelter keep you from going there to adopt a pet there though...There are MANY wonderful animals there that desperately need homes at this HIGH KILL shelter!  Just poor attitudes with the regular employees who are having to work with the budget cuts for LA county (which can't be pleasant I'm sure) Very sad situation....<//Text>

Horrible shelter. I recently lost my dog and he was taken to this pound. He has my address and phone number clearly printed on a license attached to his collar. Instead the pound put him up for adoption immediately to make a quick buck off a purebred dog.< /Review>

<Text>I TRY to do my best to avoid this internment camp for these poor animals as often as possible.
I've had to many bad experiences with the staff's horrible service here.
In today's visit, when I asked questions at the front desk, I'm replied with a tone as though they wanted me to leave.
Nonetheless, I decided to wait in my car while my gf finished her business here  -__-</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

try to adopt a dog couple years ago from this shelter, had something emergency occurred, had to take care on the day pick up, try to call them arrange another time, but no one ever answer for half hour, went there next week, dog was adopt by other owner.

went there again a year later, cant find the dog they showed online, check with staff, it was adopted already, they dont update web page on time, anyway, found another dog that really lovely. but most of people in this shelter has attitude problem, it is like you own them money to go there and adopt animals. they dont know what kind dog they dealing with, one of dog they marked as lab mix turn out to be a mastiff mix<//text>

<Name>Marcia Haworth</Name><text>I'm not sure how to rate: Fair because I had to stand for so long (I don't know what the couple in front of me was doing but it looked like a visitation more than anything.  But once I got up to the counter, the service was good.  Just disappointing.

My mom and I went looking to adopt a dog that would be suitable for my 3 young nephews: 3, 5, 7 years of age.  We found a Cocker beagle mix that we though would be perfect.  Got her number and went back to the front office.  After standing (next) in line for  probably 10 - 15 minutes, I got called up.  There were 2 people at the desk but only one assisting customers...another came in off of lunch...and helped me.  Then we were told that our dog was on hold for someone until the 5th.  They hadn't paid for her and I couldn't figure that out but then my mom says maybe they are her owners that she is being held for.    Either way, we left disappointed and will wait until Monday morning to call and hope that she is still here.<//text>< Rate>

I get that their customer service isn't all that wonderful BUT CAN YOU BLAME THEM??? I'm sure these people see some pretty horrible things daily, So I can't say I blame them for having to turn their feelings off. Don't let these reviews stop you from giving one of these amazing animals a forever home, volunteering your time or donating food, blankets, toys, etc. ♡♡♡</Text>

They add charges that are not applicable. I showed them the wrong charges and they said "That they never return a refund". I had to go through a higher branch to get my money back from them.

I went to adopt a pet, I did the walk thru saw the dog I wanted spent time with her, I asked one of the workers If She could be taken out to interact with and they said sure go to the front and give them her number..I was so excited, finally found her after visiting three shelters! So I proceed to the front give them her number and was told "she is already adopted" my heart sank...Why would you not post on her cage adopted? But ok I gave them the benifit of a doubt maybe just an honest misshap.. so here we go again do the walk through ....we find another dog, we go to the front gave them her number and the same thing happens now I'm upset! I asked them why don't you show us the pets that are available and we can take it from there, she chuckled and replied well we don't know that until you bring us a number and we run it. The staff here just seems lazy and not helpful .... is this place kidding me?</review>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>I went to adopt a pet, I did the walk thru saw the dog I wanted spent time with her, I asked one of the workers If She could be taken out to interact with and they said sure go to the front and give them her number..I was so excited, finally found her after visiting three shelters! So I proceed to the front give them her number and was told "she is already adopted" my heart sank...Why would you not post on her cage adopted? But ok I gave them the benifit of a doubt maybe just an honest misshap.. so here we go again do the walk through ....we find another dog, we go to the front gave them her number and the same thing happens now I'm upset! I asked them why don't you show us the pets that are available and we can take it from there, she chuckled and replied well we don't know that until you bring us a number and we run it. The staff here just seems lazy and not helpful .... is this place kidding me?<//Text>< Pics>

<text>They are inhumane and euthanize dogs for failing temperament tests.

This place has one of the worst customer service .  if you're going to adopt from that shelter i highly recommend it because there's a lot of animals without homes. But if your going there for any other reason it's not a good place.<//Text>

<Review>One person working the front desk. Way too many people needing help just to have one person at the counter. Wanted to inquire about a dog but didnt have the time to wait for hours. So sad that animals aren't being adopted because of lack of help. We weren't the only ones who stopped waiting for our number to be called after an hour and only two people had been helped during that whole time.</Review><Date>1506311249683</Date>< response>

< review>
This is a blood sucking money thirsty agency with no mercy. Got a puppy when it was 4 months old and get the rabies right away. The office staff told me that I can wait until the dog is a little older about 6 months to get the license. Walked in today to get the license (doing the right thing) and told I need to pay a late penalty of $120 because I should get the license within 2 weeks after rabies.I explained that the information by their staff is incorrect but they care less, with threats of charging me more penalties with LA county Animal Law.<//review>

horrible customer service. very disorganized. reception staff was rude and lacks general knowledge concerning the facility as well as getting an estimated fee for anything. Unless you have the ID# of your pet or the microchip number for them to quickly look anything up, they can't find anything about your pet and you're stuck running around the facility to find your pet. very lazy!</Text>

I don't have any personal experience with this shelter. However if this is the same Baldwin shelter that killed the Chihuahua before his due date..because he was SCARED, than you should be ashamed of yourselves. Don't you know the difference between aggressive behavior and a dog who's scared?!</text>

It's hard to tell something about this place one side they keep control on animals, over population and roaming pets it's not good and they are in charge of it, in the other side we would expect they do more for animals and be more in the love and care side but low budget probably make them a bit lazy or heartless but hope they in the best intentions help at least some< /Review>

(Translated by Google) My vicita on this occasion was to sterilize my cats, many people do not know of programs that exist to help families and their pets, in addition to sterilizing, they cut their nails, gave them flea treatment, they put their chip, medicine for pain, and its transporter box and the best all absolutely free, highly recommended! 🤩🤩🤩🤩
