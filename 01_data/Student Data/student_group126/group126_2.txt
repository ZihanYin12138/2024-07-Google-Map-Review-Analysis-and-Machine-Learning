Me and my husband were trying to call them so we can get some more apartment on our list but they wouldn't answer finally the answer when my husband called and they told him that I had lied that I had never called and that is not true that I was trying to call them because their phone lines are opened. when we got there and we ask for a new list of apartments and gave them the zip codes and names of cities like they asked she said that that is not how they work and the only way they were going to give us a list of apartments they had and we have to stick to whatever they had they lied they mislead you and they were very very rude she made me get so upset I literally said words I will not want my mom to hear.the lady started threatening to call the police she started being so rude I could not believe that I've actually paid $200 to this people that were not going to help me at all if they were not going to give me the cities I wanted or the apartments I was looking for they wanted to give me whatever they want it's terrible customer service misleading company I wouldn't recommend this to anybody.<//review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>This company false advertise and miss leads people into thinking they have a bunch of property owners under contract and therefore they will be able to get you an apartment faster and at lower rates is just a matter of you choosing.  NOT TRUE!

*****HOW IT WORKS AND WHAT TO EXPECT.*****

The way it works is as follows they ask that you give them 90 days to find you a place which the point of the contract and it cannot be terminated until after the 90 days. They collect your personal information including pay stubs for proof of income. They will also require to sign a form to run your credit which will cost $50 which is part of the 200 dollar fee they charge. Then they will give you a list of properties that meets your budget and desire locations which then they will ask you to go check out those properties and pick 3 that you like and let them know so they can schedule a viewing and if you like the apartment you then take an application fill it out to them and send to them they can do the rest. They have new listings every Wednesday but you can only get a copy of those new listings thru fax.

What your really getting for $200 is a broker office who will schedule viewing appointments, submit your application, and get you a list of properties that meet your budget and desires location. However, they don't have any connections with any of the properties and cannot negotiate a better deal for you since they get their properties from the MLS.

***** How is this for ****
If your someone who doesn't want to searching for a apartments and want someone to submit your paper work and schedule viewings for you then this is for you.</text>< username>

<review>The list they give out to search are mostly bogus there not ready to rent etc. and the way the refund works is you have to receive the list for 90 days by fax twice a week and complete a form. They make it so difficult so they can keep your money like jumping through hoops, terrible for lack of a better word, don't do it. I found an apartment with Zillow app no problem.

<text>Not only will this business stoop lower then low they go above and beyond to scam people who are in search of rentals, they print out rentals of apartments,  except the true owners of these locations have no connection to Platinum Consulting rental service,  nor recognize any of the people working for them, I had found a great duplex in Alhambra in which they promised to rent for a “small down payment of $200” and would b ready to move in by next day red flag #1 I know to good be true right? but If you live in LA n eager to move you know how it is, 3 days later n no call back, they were full of excuses as to why the rental was not ready once you ask for refund forgot about it they refuse to give it to you even if you play by the fake contract they hand you, scamming $200 bucks at a time from different people this business is dirty n will do dirty</text><Name>Steff<//Name>< date>

<Review>If I could give zero stars I would. I feel scammed by this company. They didn't fulfill any of the services they promised. Their customer service is horrible. Steve is the absolute worst! He should be jailed. They steal your money. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! If it's even a legit company. I complained about this company to the Better Business Bureau and I recommend you do the same if you feel slighted by these people as well. They need to be shut down.</Review>< pictures>

This place is BAD news. First, beware of a place that tells you cash or money order only- you're not getting your money back once it's in their hands. Second, before you walk out the door, they insist that you sign a contract saying that they've fulfilled their minimum of giving you at least three potential properties that fit your criteria; that way, if you manage to find a way to get your refund (highly unlikely), it'll be much less than the amount you originally gave them.

They're not legitimate. They pull all kinds of rental listings off the Internet without bothering to check if they're real, like craigslist, so a bunch of stuff they give you is completely fake.

The problem is they have you sign all kinds of contracts and paperwork so that you can't take them to court. What they're doing is not illegal, just highly unethical. But they don't care whom they rip off, as long as they get the money. Avoid this place like the plague!<//review><GmapID>0x80c2da8dd73839e7:0xa73fa37c9625d182<//GmapID><pictures>None< /pictures>< rating>

Worst agency ever!!!!! The first receptionist to answer the phone is kind , but the 2nd you get transferred to has so much attitude it appalls me what she put on her resume to get hired. I asked her what steps I needed to complete to receive assistance and she gave attitude expecting me to have all of the answers ! My husband called to cancel before the 90 days because they were of no help and every time was told to call again later, he was given the run around. We were promised $150 and were scammed to receive nothing out of their own negligence. I would not recommend this agency to anyone they make money off of innocent hard working people who are genuinely seeking assistance. If I could give zero stars I would.< /Text>

So, I just called them because I found an ad of “El Classificado” I called the number listed. I Spoke to a lady by the name “Mary.” This lady said that all I needed was to give them a money order of 200 bucks to process my credit check. She also said that those 200 bucks will ensure that the property is reserved for me. I have bad credit and I need an apartment. I almost fell for it. Good thing I saw the reviews first. Man, what a shame.</Text>

This company has been utterly awful! They bring you in with false promises, they don't return your phone calls. And if you get upset because these things are happening they hang up on you or ignore you. They did not help us find a place, as a matter of fact we didn't even receive any phone calls regarding listings after our first phone call. We had to do all of our own research to find our own place. I would never recommend this place to anybody ever! We have been treated with nothing but unkind words, rude actions, and unprofessional DISRRESPECTFUL behavior. When one person is tired of dealing with you they push you off to the next person, with no results other than the actions above. They fight you to not give you your money back. All profit that they make must be from the people they're stealing money from. They make it so difficult on you to get your refund after they don't help you. I would give a 0 if I could 0 Stars not one. I will continue to fight to get my money back. And I will continue to take this farther than just a review on the internet. I encourage anybody else who has gone through what me and my husband have gone through to please follow the same actions. I personally will be starting with filing a report with the Better Business Bureau< /Review>

<Text>DO NOT trust this so called "rental service"! They DO NOT fully explain how to get your refund.  I went in to have them explain to me on how to get my refund. The worker was very rude and told me I should have read the contract. She asked me if i knew how to read. And that even a 18 year old can understand it. She was very unprofessional and had no right to speak to me a  "customer" like they way she did. They have 0 costumer service. There are so many things they need in order for you to get your refund including giving them 24 listings that you have to get on your own from an  EFAX. Which is ONLY free for 30days. They NEVER explained this to me before. All they said is that i would get my refund 5-10 business days after the contract termination date. They try to get people not to realize ALL paperwork they need in order to get their refund. Its very unethical. David Ramierez promised me i would be the only person to view a rental and if i wanted it it would be mine without any other information needed. Which was a TOTAL LIE! They failed to give me any appointments and when i called to ask about them they just gave me excuses saying they are waiting for a response from the owners of the rentals. They get their listings anywhere online without the owners and landlords permission to use for their "services". They are taking money from innocent people. DO NOT give them your $200. I researched them. They got sued by 3 people from small claims court for not refunding money and there is an article on the LA Times about how they are fraud and how they tried to shut them down. The owner of this company is Carlos Martinez google this company and him. DON'T fall for their lies! This word has to be spread to everyone!

Horrible service never go here or pay them you will regret it. REPORT THEM TO THE BETTER BUISNESS BUREAU SO THEY CAN BE SHUT DOWN. I had nothing but problems from day one. There workers are incompentent and could not even answer all my questions about their own service. Then when the worker gave me wrong information the agency put the blame on me that I did not hear them right. Also even if you cancel the service you still will not get your money back for 3 months. Do not waste your time or money here they will take advantage of you.<//text>

<rating>2<//rating><Text>SCAM!! DISHONEST!!! RUDE!!! first off, you will not be selecting any of their listings, extremely overpriced and scary locations Second the listing they provide you will not accommodate your needs even if you tell them what you need (I have large dogs, none of the listings visited will allow them). Thirdly, when you find a place without their help they will not be giving you a refund. This is because even after finding a home, you must continue to drive to their location and receive their updated listing for 24 weeks, even through you have a place to stay already. Plus they have a clause in their contract about suing them and the limits of their liability. I should have taken it as a sign of how often people threaten to sue them.<//Text>< pics>

<Name>Chuck Johnson<//Name><review>Total scam artists!!! I went back to this place several times to ask for my money back and when the lady keep putting me off she finally said after 90 days. I waited and waited of course and when 90 days was up same old thing. They asked me to send them a copy of my current lease to see if it was one of their properties,no biggie Westside asked for the same thing. Except they gave me a full refund when they saw it was`nt one of their properties. I called and called and did everything they asked for and still they got me!! Complete fake business. I would have rather them walk up and jacked me instead of this. I should have read the reviews at first.< /review>< pictures>

Never ever deal with these thugs, total scam and after when you file a request to refund your money they don't even take your call. You should drive to their destination several times. Hopefully I can return part of my money. They do literally nothing for you<//text>

My experience with them was just so awfull!
You basically have to do everything.
Like set up an appointment call, call them so you can get the faxes.. you are literally giving away 200 dollars if you find something with them or when you ask for a refund they keep 60 DOLLARS. Their customer service is trash. Always with an attitude so peopke dont waste your money here< /Review>

This agency is using legal but immoral practices to lure people into renting with them. DO NOT DO BUSINESS with this agency. They take advantage of low income or non-English speaking people to cough up $200 for a deposit which is wrong. Avoid this scum of a company.< /Review>

They post on Craigslist and you can't tell its those fake agencies I've been played once by one of these a different one called city rentals in Baldwin park which also BEWARE I still see them on Craigslist and el calsificado they are more obvious scammers but these people posted on Craigslist a legit looking post called them right away told me same usual bs as all the other ones $200 before I show you like really? I acted polite told them never mind that was Friday I keep blocking their number but they find different 626 ones to call me from. Please beware I know its hard to find a decently priced good home these days and we can get desperate but these people and many other similar "Realtors"  are scams and won't help you they just take you're $200 anyone who makes you pay just to see a home is a scammer. Keep your money don't believe them or anyone else who says come to my office pay $200 than you can see the property. Taking advantage of many who barely could make ends meet like myself shame on you people!</review>

So horrible. They say we can get our money back when we don't find a place with them and my husband and i found one through someone else within a month and they say we have to wait another 2 months. Seriously? Also they haven't called us within this month to give us more leasings. Absolutely horrible.< /Text>

They do not work for real owners, just collect advertisements over internet and re-advertise them as they where theirs. I filled a form to get my money back 2 days after i signed the contract, because i went to see the house they told me to see and I told the owner that I came from this place, and he never had heard of them! So I sign the refund agreement, they told me that everything is fine, that in 90 days I will have my money (just part of it 130$) back.

Guess what happened after 90 days? They told me that I had have to take 24 houses updates over this 90 days and that because I didn´t, I do not have a refund. Sounds legit?

Please review google comments before you fall on this SCAM. I didn´t and now i'm 180$ poorer, but it is the feeling of being scamed the worst.

Beware it is a SCAM!</Review>< username>

(Translated by Google) Everything is a scam. If I had seen the reviews before, I would never have believed in the lies of a woman who says her name is Paty, do not believe in that place the contact is rubbish.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Terrible service very friendly when you go to make the contract and leave your 200dls later they are very despotic and they only steal your money they do not teach you properties they only waste your time and they say that they will refund you if they do not help you grab some property and ask you to Take all the lists that they give you during the 3 months that the contract lasts, even if you find a house by your side, they require 24 sheets of the properties that they say are for rent. And even if you take it what they ask you, they don't give you anything back.

(Original)
Terrible servicio muy amables cuando vas hacer el contrato y dejes tus 200dls después son bien déspotas y solo te roban tu dinero no  te enseñan propiedades solo te hacen perder el tiempo y dicen que te hacen reembolso si no te ayudan agarrar alguna propiedad y te piden que lleves todas las listas que te dan durante los 3 meses que dura el contrato aun que encuentres casa por tu lado te exigen 24 hojas de las propiedades que ellos según te dicen que están de renta. Y aun que la lleves lo que te piden no te devuelven nada.< /Text><date>1625368747410</date>< userid>

(Translated by Google) Bad experience with these people, since March I went to find them to help me rent an apartment, they gave me several addresses, I liked a little house and I told them that I liked that one, and I said they could never communicate with them because the owner of the house I never answered them, we were attended by a certain CHRIS ,, and since they never gave us an answer, we asked for a refund and now it turns out that they cannot give it ,,, if they have been scammed by these people, just like I join to sue them because It is not fair that these people take advantage of us ,,,, I do not have money to be giving to them ,,,, they are scammers

(Translated by Google) The worst place, if you don't want to lose your money don't go there!
It is a scam they ask you for 200 dlls to find you a place to live but they never help you and they do not return your money ...
I had suspicions of that place and I have video and photo evidences ...
I will demand that it is not fair that so many people are swindled that they earn their money with sacrifice, Paty's name is the lady who treated me and swindled.

(Translated by Google) It is a fraud! Don't give your $ 200 you will lose it. They offer rentals that do not exist. They send you lists that exceed the agreed amount, I chose 3 that were close to the budget and I could never get an appointment. Their customer service line always leaves you waiting, when they attend to you and ask why they have such a bad deal full of deceit, they get upset, they treat you rudely and even hang you. When 90 days have passed to make the refund. They denied it saying that I did not ask for it the day that I should do it. Incredible that they are allowed to do dishonest work. They are scammers. "FRAUD"

(Original)
Es un fraude! No des tus $200 los perderás. Ofrecen alquileres que no existen. Te envían listas que sobrepasan el monto acordado, elegí 3 que se acercaban al presupuesto y jamás pude obtener una cita. Su línea de atención al cliente siempre te deja en espera, cuando te atienden y preguntas por qué tienen tan mal trato lleno de engaños, se molestan, te tratan de forma grosera e incluso te cuelgan. Cuando se cumplieron los 90 días para hacer el reembolso. Lo negaron diciendo que no lo pedí el día que debía hacerlo. Increible que se les permita realizar un trabajo deshonesto. Son unos estafadores. "FRAUDE"<//review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Good night, my bad experience and bad luck was to have been a victim of this company which is totally dedicated to LYING to people and unfortunately in kissing the most needy. Yege to this company requesting their services because they swore and perjured that they did not check the credit that they only checked what they earned with the bank account statements with that was enough and that they had properties to enter immediately to enter within a period of 3 to 5 days and that all their properties were totally remodeled. All this was told to me by a person named ANTONIO. He himself gave me 5 address sheets so that I could go see and if I liked them I would tell him to apply I went to see the properties when I arrived I see that nothing they told me is true that everywhere they send you They check your credit like anywhere in Beses if you come across properties that you rent with the statements of account but it is a coin in the air, things are not as beautiful as when they ask you for the $ 200 dlls to apply. It caught my attention that when I went through another 5 pages of addresses why in the first few the apt that I liked did not qualify one of the ladies who works there began to use the same words that Antonio used there is where I realized that they play with one as a customer. The words they use are benga today I have many opportunities for you benga today because tomorrow I have many sited and orita no orita I can attend to you they are newly remodeled properties so we are in a hurry to rent the owners are desperate because they took a long remodeling and what they They want to rent, just look at the property and if you like it immediately, you can enter, just bring your proof of income (bank statements) and if you see that you earn enough, we will rent you the credit is not a problem. People's work is respected but not LYING with a white glove. All addresses that are for rent are available in the HOTPADS app application. APP: HOTPATS IN THE APPLICATION YOU PUT EVERYTHING WHEN YOU WANT TO SPEND THAT YOU LOOK FOR A DEPARTMENT OR HOUSE OR WHAT YOU LOOK FOR FROM HOW MANY BATHROOMS THE AREA YOU WANT AND THE APPLICATION THROWS YOU ALL THE AVAILABILITIES IT IS THE PERSONAL PHONE NUMBER OF THE MANAGERS PROPERTY WITH WHICH YOU CAN NEGOTIATE DIRECTLY. THANK YOU

Buenas noches mi mala experiencia y mala suerte fue aver sido víctima de esta compañía la cual se dedica total mente a MENTIRLE a las personas y lamentable mente enbeses la más necesitada . Yege a esta compañía solicitando sus servicios pues ellos juraban y perjuraban que no checaban el crédito que solo les comprobara lo que ganaba con los estados de cuenta del banco con eso era suficiente y que tenían propiedades para entrar inmediatamente para entrar en un plazo de 3 a 5 días y que que todas sus propiedades estaban total mente remodeladas . Todo eso me lo dijo una persona llamada ANTONIO . El mismo me dio 5 hojas d domicilios para que fuera a ver y ya si me gustaban le dijera a el para aplicar fui a ver las propiedades al llegar miro que nada de lo que me dijeron es verdad que en todas las partes donde ellos te mandan chequean tu crédito como en cualquier parte en beses si te topas con propiedades que con los estados de cuenta te renten pero es una moneda en el aire no son las cosas tan bonitas como cuando te piden los $200 dlls para aplicar . Me llamo mucho la atención que cuando fui por otras 5 hojas de domicilios  por qué en las primeras el apt que me gusto no califique una de las señoras que trabaja hay empeso a utilizar las mismas palabras que Antonio utiliso ai es donde me di cuenta que juegan con uno como cliente . Las palabras que utilisan son benga hoy tengo muchas oportunidades para usted benga hoy por que mañana tengo muchos sitados y orita no orita lo puedo atender son propiedades recién remodeladas por eso estamos apurados en rentar los dueños están desesperados por que tardaron mucho remodelando y lo que ellos quieren es ya rentar, nomas mira la propiedad y si le gusta inmediatamente puede entrar solo traiga sus comprobante de ingreso (estados de cuenta del banco ) y si comprueba que gana lo suficiente le rentamos el crédito no es un problema . Se respeta el trabajo de las personas pero no MINTIENDO con guante blanco . Todos los domicilios que están en renta se encuentran disponibles en la aplicación de app HOTPADS.  APP: HOTPATS EN LA APLICACION TU PONES TODO CUANDO QUIERES GASTAR QUE BUSCAS DEPARTAMENTO O CASA O LO QUE BUSQUES DE CUANTOS BAÑOS EL AREA QUE TU QUIERAS Y LA APLICACION TE ARROJA TODA LAS DISPONIBILIDADES AI MISMO ESTA EL NUMERO DE TELEFONO PERSONAL DE LOS ENCARGADOS DE LA PROPIEDAD CON LOS CUALES PUEDES NEGOCIAR DIRECTAMENTE .

<Review>(Translated by Google) The worst, they say that they will help you find a place to live, and they only give you the properties the first day if you do not call they do not call you, pay attention to the 90-day contract because they say you can end the service when you want but be careful with them that when they want the money back they have to have 24 sheets of all the properties they give them, if they don't have that they will give us the money back ... Tolatmete a scam avoid this company altogether.

(Original)
Lo peor, dicen q te van ayudar a encontrar un sito donde vivir, y solo te dan las propiedades el primer dia si tu no llamas no te llaman, preseten atención al contrato de los 90 dias porque dicen q puedes terminar el servicio ciando quieras pero tengan cuidado con ellos q cuando quieren el dinero de vuelta tienen q tener 24 hojas de todas las propiedades q les dan, si no tienen eso nos les daran el dinero de vuelta... Tolatmete una estafa eviten por completo esta compañía.</Review>< pics>

I am beyond grateful I chose Bobby Cloud as my attorney when I decided to go back to court. Mr. Cloud made sure my voice was heard, and I am now able to enjoy my sons on the weekend. Now the weekends are equal, and my sons cannot go out of state without my permission or a court order. Everything he said I could ask for I received. He made sure I knew what was reasonable and what was not. Mr. Cloud and Lorena were great and made this process so much better!!

Thank You Both!!!< /text>

Thanks Bobby! Talk about honest and professional. I called with an issue that I wasn't sure how to go about and Bobby was very honest in letting me know that I didn't need an attorney for what I was trying to accomplish. He definitely had my best interest at heart because not only did he refer to someone that could help me but also saved me a hefty chunk of money. Highly recommend .</review>

Great attorney. Helped us get supervised visitations for the other party for the safety of our child. Something that I feel is hard since courts rarely take full custody away from the mothers. Price was reasonable. I called around many attorneys didn’t even want to bother since the case was and Shafter. The ones that were willing to take the case wanted to charge double of what Bobby Cloud charged us. Happy that we choose Bobby Cloud. Plus we loved his red suspenders!< /Text>

After reading other reviews on this thread, I CAN NOT understand how Bobby Cloud Law could get anything but 5 stars! Those other people are wrong!! Getting divorced is probably the hardest thing you will ever have go through! This lawyer is professional and has your back throughout the entire process. There wasn’t a single time I didn’t feel like I wasn’t at the top of his priority list! Yeah, this stuff is hard and emotional, but Bobby always made me feel like he was there for me and me alone! I sat in those court rooms many times waiting for my turn and there wasn’t a single other lawyer I would have trusted after watching them fumble their cases! You want to win?!? You want to keep your dignity during a time when you are at your lowest place?!? Stop wasting your time with others, call his office and schedule a consultation. Sure.....It costs money to retain a lawyer, but this is the only place you will feel like your money was well spent when it’s over!!

I will recommend Bobby Cloud Law over and over without hesitation! Thank you Bobby for all that you have done!<//text>

<Review>We called Bobby after we had already started the process of two TRO’s in family court. TBH I wish we had reached out to him before we filed but we had to act fast to protect a child. Bobby and his staff, guided us on the next steps and what would happen. Our case was rare and he prepared us for what could happen and what would most likely happen. Bobby fought so hard for our cases and it’s complicated but he did everything he could do. We are so thankful to him and his office for all they did. We hope our attorney in the other state is as amazing as Bobby and his office. I highly recommend Bobby cloud! Hopefully I never need him again but if I do, he’s the only one I would trust to help me.<//Review><user_id>111392777944439302106< /user_id>< Pictures>

Save your money for a real lawyer! Literally the worst experience a person can have with this law office. First of all, it takes them weeks to return your emails or phone calls and if you send another email or call to see why they haven't responded to your communication, you are being charged for those! Lastly I just never felt like the Bobby Cloud ever really represented me or cared. After thousands of dollars, I finally hired another professional attorney that has been a completely different and wonderful experience.</text>

<text>Hates women. Lied to a judge to get my business phone records for his client. I was in no way involved in his clients affairs or divorce, just a competitor to his client's mediocre business. I understand winning a case, legitimately, like good attorneys do.....but the shady tactics this genius uses are immoral and unethical. I believe lying to a judge to promote your good ol' boy  reputation, in Bakersfield, is a low most decent lawyers don't attempt. And I know 20+ attorneys in town. They all smirk when this clowns name is mentioned. His name is synonymous with "all bark, no bite." So prepare for dirty. It's all he's got.</text><gmap_id>0x80ea69f4d0e6e6f3:0x28d34c2499a91a3d<//gmap_id><rating>1<//rating>< Resp>

Bobby Cloud is the greatest thing since sliced mustard!  Bobby Cloud helped to get my custody orders transferred from the State of Missouri to California in 2014/2015 and then helped to meticulously modify those old orders into new ones which would provide me with the added layers of safety and security I required in order to insure that my children would be safe and protected when they were in the care of their mother.  I had previous attorney's before Bobby Cloud, all of which accomplished nothing and actually gave away more to the mother than they did to help me.  Only with the upstanding, decent efforts of Bobby Cloud Law and his staff, was I finally able to get my case to a place where I know they always got my back covered.

My kids reside with me, their father, full-time and I have my Attorney, Bobby Cloud to thank for a big part of that because of all his hard work, effort, and knowledge of inter-state judicial issues.

I highly recommend Bobby Cloud, Jr and his staff Bobby Cloud Law</Text>

<text>I'm so thankful for Bobby Cloud and his paralegal Lorena!  They have truly been a blessing in a very difficult time in life. If you need help with a family law case, look no further!  Mr. Cloud and his team are experienced and caring. They fight for you with genuine concern for your situation. It's hard to find that in an attorney. Sadly your just dollar signs to most family law attorneys in Bakersfield. Not with Bobby Cloud he has shown compassion for me and my daughter. He is fighting with our best interest in mind, and I will be forever thankful!

Get the free consultation with Bobby and it'll confirm this review. At my free consultation, he already had a plan for my case. I knew then he was the one best fit for me and to fight against a previous custody order. Bobby Cloud and his staff are phenomenal. Their hard work overturn the custody order set prior. We are now a complete and happy family. The length of each case will be different,  but you will not be disappointed with Bobby Cloud and his staff. I am forever grateful and could not vocalize enough thanks for how the success made my family and I feel.< /review>< Pics>

<review>Bobby Cloud is the best attorney I ever met. When I came to him, I had a complex legal matter that required a unique legal solution. Mr. Cloud found a solution and applied the law to my case. I was also happy with the services of his office staff. Most of all, Mr. Cloud charged me a fair fee for a fair service. If you need an attorney call Bobby Cloud.< /review><rating>5< /rating><date>1507604841362<//date>< Pictures>

Bobby is very patient when it comes to hearing your situation and gets right to the plan. His staff are all so wonderful and helpful. I speak with his  paralegal, Trish and oh my god is she WONDERFUL! She is amazing at her job and I feel very comfortable with her working on my case along with Bobby they are both on top of everything. If you are looking for a Family law office that will not only tell you they will do everything in their power but show you and won't ever give your second thoughts about hiring (the first time I spoke with Bobby I didn't think twice about making them my choice) and I don't regret it either. In by all means get in contact with Bobby and I guarantee you won't regret it. :)<//Review>

<text>My fiance and I went through a challenging child custody battle for about 5 months with his ex in regards to child custody. The outcome was great my fiance was able to obtain joint physical custody about 90% August 2017. I would highly recommend Bobby Cloud as your family law attorney and of course all his team especially to Lorena Light ( Paralegal ) that played an important role to my fiance's case.You NEED a smart and agressive attorney like Bobby Cloud that will fight for you till the end. My fiance and I can't thank enough Bobby Cloud and Lorena Light for their dedication to this case. We would give a 10 STAR THANK YOU!!!!!< /text>< Rating>

I attained this lawyer for a Child custody & Child support situation I was going through with the mother of my first child.  Bobby Cloud is aggressive and I walked away happy with the results! I had a previous attorney who seemed to go along with what the other party wanted and Bobby Cloud did not. He stood firm, was not late to any court hearings/proceedings, and exercised my rights well. Before Bobby Cloud I thought there were no attorneys in Bakersfield that had that "fight" in them.  His rates are very reasonable, especially for the service you receive.<//Review>

I've used several local Kern County attorneys over the last ten years in child custody matters and hands down Bobby Cloud was the best. I was out of a job and needed an attorney that was willing to work with me financially. Bobby didn't have to help, no one else was willing, but he took the time to meet up with me knowing my financial situation, and listened to the circumstances of my case. This man has a huge heart and took on my case. Thanks to Bobby I now have custody of my daughter Catelynn. Thank you Bobby and Staff for all your hard work and God Bless You!<//Review>

I cannot sing enough praise for Bobby Cloud or his staff.  They were the consummate professional law firm that all other law firms should emulate.  Thank you Mr. Cloud for the sincere attention that you gave me and my case.  Mr. Cloud was able to resolve a case in a matter of months that had been dragging on for almost 5 years.  Thank you Bobby for getting the job done, I will continue to highly recommend you and your law firm to anyone who needs legal services.< /text>

<text>If I could give this idiot a 0 I would. Do NOT hire this so called attorney. Met with him one time and that was to hire him for a divorce. From then on he cancelled our appointments, I could only speak with the paralegal, he would cancel court dates without telling me. I'd stay clear of this man. Don't waste your money.</text>< response>

< Review>
I would give Bobby Cloud ZERO stars if I could. I don't know where to begin...Mr. Cloud was appointed as minors counsel to represent my children, I did not choose him. He did nothing for them. He was very arrogant and insulted me in every conversation. He never missed a chance to throw me under the bus or speak ill of me in front of the judge and a full court room. He claimed that the lack of progress in the case was my fault when in reality it was his lack of work. The only phone call we had he yelled at me and said he was so tired of this case. He made sexist insults towards me throughout the conversation. He threatened to take my children from me and give them to a person who has done absolutely nothing for them in 10 years after telling him that I wanted to request someone else to represent my children. He said he had the power to make that happen. Mr. Cloud and his office did no research of any kind. Messages left for him were either never given and or he decided not to return my phone calls. Not once did he ever call me to speak to his clients or take into consideration their feelings or needs. I have never in my life been treated so horribly. I will update as the case progresses, or should I say drags on, as it is still being litigated.</Review>

If you want an attorney that gives everything to your EX, and does NOTHING for you even though you paid him up front, by all means hire Bobby Cloud.  What a horrible attorney.  Well, then, aren't they all crooks.</Review>

< review>
I was very dissatisfied with Mr Cloud.  I think an attorney should fight for his client. We hire you to fight for us. When I left the court room my child support went up$250, and I have to pick up (which is ok) the kids, but to my surprise i had to drop off the kids as well. Mr cloud never told me that was part of the deal, so 3yrs later I am still doing all of the transportation, mom  doesn't do anything but Collect a check from me..
I paid Mr Cloud $3500 and that only lasted 4 months, and he sent me to collections for $1200 more...

P.s. I hired him in 2015 so it's been awhile...but I still feel strongly enough to right this review.</review>

When seeking a lawyer we needed a straight answer saying we were going to win or not win, Cloud reassured us that with patience we would definitely win but let us know from the start that abandonment wasnt a few months process and that it could take years. Our case started in August 2014 and after a little over a year, he helped us win our abandonment case September 2015!! Not only did he keep his word, when it came to payment arrangements he worked so well with us. The staff working there were all so nice and happy to help us with any questions we needed answered. My fiancé is taking the next step necessary to adopt my son and Cloud was more than happy to help us once again. I would highly recommend Bobby Cloud to all, he was amazing and very patient every step of the way!! 😊😊</Text><userid>104071415241705308102</userid>< user_name>

Worst experience I've ever had. Wouldn't recommend him to anyone. This is my first divorce and not knowing what to expect I was just left wondering the entire time what the next process or step was....
He does not follow up with anything and seemed to be defending the other side more than me, his client!< /review>

This restaurant which is part of the Meritage Resort and SPA is pretty nice and good for a nice romantic dinner.  The attention is excellent and the food was pretty delicious, I had the Pan Seared Scallops and the were cooked to perfection.  It is a bit pricey, so be prepared to spend at least $100 for dinner and a glass of wine for two if not more.<//text>

<Review>This place was not good at all. The service was terrible. The food was terrible. We were staying at the nearby resort and figured we would just walk over - even after reading the other reviews, we figured we would give it shot. It was NOT worth it. Absolutely do not eat here!!!<//Review><rate>1<//rate><username>Kaylin Brabec</username>< response>

Service wasn’t great and the venue wasn’t even half full. we had 5 different people to deal with, none of whom seemed to talk to the other. Caesar salad was very missable; risotto took an eternity but was quite good.<//Review>

<time>1466610378441<//time><Review>The food is good, especially the strawberry cheesecake, served with a scoop of mint ice cream. The lime butter that comes with the bread is very yummy.

I went for dinner by myself which can be a bit awkward but the staff was friendly and made it easier.

The prices are high but not surprisingly so given it's a resort.

The service is fast and simple.< /Review><resp>None<//resp>< user_id>

<Review>I rarely give bad reviews. We were treated horribly. We were first told there were "no tables for you, because all the tables are reserved" and the wait would be 25-50 minutes. We wanted to stay at the hotel and enjoy the amenities, since we're members, finally away for our one trip, and our young kid was going to lose it since it was late and we were hungry. So we told them we'd come back in 15-20 minutes. When we came back, they were seating people immediately without reservations. We were seated and ignored. The person who seated us said they'd bring a high chair. They never came back. No one did. Not for drinks, nothing. Even though we knew it was late and it would upset our kid, we had no choice but to leave. The moment we stood up, our table was cleared.

All we can figure is we were being treated that way because we had a child. We dressed nicely,  there was one other older kid, and they had high chairs so... We've never felt treated so specifically bad anywhere. Definitely no perks to being an SVC member.

We strongly recommend that if you want to stay in your room or the pool or eating late past the kids' bedtime, use one of the excellent food ordering/delivery services that will bring your family food from many of the downtown restaurants- fancy, chain, and fast food.<//Review>< gmap_id>

The buffet is horrendous, almost inedible and will cost you $30 per person. There are much better and more affordable places just 10 minutes away.< /Review>

The food is okay. I've had cheaper and better dead cow at themed franchise steakhouses. I tasted a rib eye and a sirloin. Deserts are much better.
The service was really good.
Probably the wines make up for the food. But oenology is beyond me.<//Text>

<Review>Our server Ray L.  was fantastic.  It was one of our last dinners on our honeymoon and was the best we have had! ...we went over to Trinitas winery which is on-site and has amazing wines for $25 and up.  Siena waves the corkage fee which is $20 so it's an amazing value.  The food was unique and delicious.  I had bone marrow and Ahi Tuna with guac and pico.  My wife had ceasars salad and barrata risotto.  So good!<//Review><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

This is a nice 4 mile hike.  We were camping down below so it was convenient to come up and check out the sunset< /Text>

Fun moderate hike! Went on Saturday midday. Decent number of hikers. Icy and slippery so take your time. Saw multiple people falling. Wear boots because it is muddy. Mask up and dress in layers! Beautiful views at the summit.< /Text>

Nice easy hike. About 4 miles round trip. It was very windy at the summit, but the view is awesome! Come and it for yourself.<//Text>

I hiked this in snow. It was incredibly beautiful. It would take a poet to do the view at the top justice.

Be VERY careful when there's ice. Things get very slippery, especially near the summit. It would be very easy to slip and careen off the side to your death, so hold fast to the handrails near the top and take it slowly and surely.

There's no signal on T-Mobile for most of the hike, but the summit had signal, in case you need to make an emergency call.</Text>

The views are amazing...but it gets really busy and cramped up top with everyone waiting their turn to take a pic. The parking lot with a $10 fee is across the street from the trailhead.<//review>

We arrived at 830 am.  You must park across the street and pay $10 for parking.  The trail is absolutely beautiful and there was plenty of shade as the brush is very tall on both sides.  It's 2 miles to the top, and fairly easy trail.  We saw 2 snakes but both were getting out of our way. The view at the top is amazing, overlooking miles and miles all the way around.  The top is the best part, be sure to climb up the steps to the top.  We had a snack, took pictures and headed down the hill.  It's an easy walk down.  I love this hike it was fast and easy for us. I was back in San Diego at noon.<//Review>

Moderately strenuous hike along a well marked trail and amazing views at Stonewall Peak. Hike down the backside and connect with Cold Springs Trail for a return to Paso Picacho State Park and clean bathrooms. Total 5.4 miles 1000 feet of climbing.<//text>

< Review>
Had my right back window regulator replaced and I had to take it back because it wasn't working I had it replaced in April then it just stopped working.  Anyways they were trying to make me pay another $247.00 to have it replaced. The recipe that was given to me the front sheet had a bunch of different items that they wanted to replace and the manager was going by that.  He didn't even think of turning the recipe over. I guess it was easier to just charge me another $247.00 .
When I bought it to his attention he was clearly upset about being set straight. He didn't want to look me in my eyes after I corrected him. The first and only thing I have to say about Big o tires is save your recipe otherwise you'll end up paying for their mistakes.</Review>

Great place to do business with. Staff is very kind and understanding. With my current experience they helped me dissolve issues i was having with my current vehicle. Allowing intricate details as to the process my car was going through. They handled my tire replacement quickly even though i provided my own rims and tires. The associates moved quickly and effeciently to solve my problems. Very happy with my visits.</review>

My daughter lives here in Modesto and I live in Michigan. The dad I am always making sure her car is safe to drive for her and my grand kids. I was here last month for an emergency visit at that time I seen she needed two new front tires. Not knowing the area the first tire shop I seen was big o close to her home. At the counter I spoke with Tony. He gave me a great deal on two tires and an alignment. I'm here again cause my daughter picked up a nail on one of the two old tires. With life still on the tire it could not be repaired. I could only really afford one so again Tony has given me a great deal on two new tires. I'm so glad I came here. I recommend this place of business with 5 star's. Thanks Tony and all your staff! Roland and Kimberlie</review>

Needed ALL FOUR new tires.  😒 [ I  know ! ] If they don't have your tire size or enough, they can order & will come the next day.  Got the lowest price ones.  $ 400 out the door.  Tony [ the manager ] is really nice & knocked off some when I asked if they had a senior d/c. Thank you  Modesto store  !!</Text>

These guys are decent hardworking people. I got 4 new tires mounted, balanced & aligned as well as they fixed my tail light that was out for 500$ & i got a 3 year warranty! Even better is it only took a total of 2.5hours for the entire job! Dillon has amazing customer service skills & i appreciated his knowledge he shared with me abt my car! Customer for life! The guys!

I booked an appointment and waited literally for them to help every other walk in customer and them all ignore me! Don’t even bother making appointments because phone calls are preferred and the customers just get stared at and get told to wait!
Asked to speak to a Supervisor and some new employee tells me he’s the manager after I just heard him say he was new!

I called one day due to shaking in the front of my car and they said to come down immediately. No appointments no waiting. They were all about my safety. Soon as I got there the front desk workers approached my concerns immediately. I explained to them I had really bad shaking in the front when I braked. They referred me to Terry and he helped me going forward. He did a diagnostic test for free. He told me I need a new tires and took the time to show me why not just tell me and make a sale. I had a tire in the front separating and two in the back with the wire showing. Once they put there tires on the shaking was much better but was still persistent when I drove it with the Terry he explained it may need break and rotors. We took it back to the shop and sure enough I needed brakes and rotors. Once again showed me that I needed it not just told me to make a sale. I am now driving my 2007 vehicle and it feels brand new thanks to Big O Tires the effort goes to the team there<//review>< pictures>

Terry and his Team did an excellent job. I only came in to replace a tire, but Terry recommended and assured me he could get the same tire as the others on my car, instead of up-selling me on another more expensive tire as other shops have done. The entire Team was very professional and there service was impeccable. I will definitely be coming back for other Auto service.</review>

What’s going on with the hours? I bought a Groupon for an oil change and I am trying to make an appointment online and there are literally NO available appointments? I called a few times and no answer, on their website it says they’re an Essential Business, so what’s the deal? Is it just that the hours changed? Someone help anyone.. lol!</Text>

as far as the service goes they are good. However I keep my glove box locked. After getting my car back my glove box was unlocked and the middle console had been rifled through. as far as I can tell nothing was taken. My car was there to have its tires serviced as far as I know there is no need for them to go through my glove box or my middle console. And if it was necessary they should have notified me prior to going through my car searching for whatever it was they were searching for.< /Text>

Went in to get tires for the work car..sold me some take offs super cheap. Loved that! Advised. The tie rod end was shot, replaced myself, drove a lot better. I found them very fair, helpful, and gave me a better deal than any where else. Highly recommend.</Review>

So I wouldn't ruin the integrity I took the tire off right away and replaced it with a spare. I took the tire in the next day when it was open and they had the audacity to charge me $163 more dollars staying I ruined the integrity of the tire. How on Earth did that happen to a tire that is so expensive and is suppose to be a great tire. I was so upset and they didn't even try to give an understanding. Then they were suppose to call when the tire was ready and didn't even do that. I had to call there. What kind of customer service is that!!!!! I will not spend this type of money here ever again. The flip side was that Andy was very nice when I went in to get the tire and was apologetic that no one had called. I thath him for that. I just don't understand what happened to good customer service....< /Review><rating>1<//rating>< user>

I rated 5 stars because the good always pops up first. But really I would not recommend this place!!! I went for an oil change and it took them over an hour. Keep in mind they were NOT busy. Then they ask me if I wanted my cabin air filter and engine filter changed. I said only cabin air filter not the engine. Well the did both anyway and still charged me for both including labor!!< /Review>

<text>They found a way to charge me for more than an oil change! And they poured oil all over my exhaust so my car stunk like  burning oil the rest of the day and was smoking. I was not happy.

So after the above review the owner contacts me, gives me his email and ask me to email him. HIS EMAIL IS INVALID . WOW

Well it's been 11 mos since my first visit . The owner wanted to make things right so he offerred another oil change at no charge.i accepted yesterday. Did an awesome job and was a very up standing person. Thanks Tony< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

< review>
Brought in my 2003 GMC Sierra 1500 pickup truck with 229,958miles on original motor. I had a blown engine and transmission. The staff was courteous and very helpfull, within 2weeks I had my truck back and it feels like a new truck. I am currently in for my first oil change and the team is going through it with great detail.
I have been a loyal customer of Big O for many years now and I DO RECOMEND them to everyone.< /review>

They got my car on the rack, and told me they could not do an alignment because my control arm and bushings were too bad on both sides.  Then they write me an estimate and it was $278.50 for labor, $89.99 for an alignment, $400 in parts, and $31.50 for tax. Oh yea, $23.99 discounted  because of a special they are having today.  That was parts and labor.  When i got on line and did my research, the parts were only $75 from Auto shack, and that was for everything, then I called a local garage that deals with alignments only,  they said their fees is only $300 for everything, parts and labor.  Big o wanted $400 for parts, and $278.50 in labor, and tax is 31.50, with a grand total of $710. That is a difference of $410.  I feel I would have been taken to the cleaners by these guys, they even told me they would set up a lay away plan for me if I was having trouble coming up with the money. Boy, what nerve! So, people, please, do your research before committing to this place, they will rob you if you let them, there was a big difference when I did my research!</review><UserId.>105488131339148048552<//UserId.><gmap_id>0x809050d63f786087:0x7f72f252c493c525< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Purchased 4 Michelin Ps4s tires and a synthetic oil change for my GTI today, the tires are  a lil hard to find in stock locally in my size.  Tony ordered the tires from Sacramento and had them installed in the same day that I called Big O Tires. The Big O employees were friendly, courteous and helpful in my purchase.
I also really appreciated the auto tech showing me exactly what was wrong with my one slightly bent wheel on the wheel balance machine and going over a visual inspection of the wheels condition on the car before the repair was started,  the wheels were even wiped after the tires were installed.  Very happy with my service today at Big O Tires on McHenry in Modesto,Ca. I'll deff be back in the future for other repairs. Thanks Tony and crew!</text><user_name>Samuel B< /user_name>< Pics>

<review>I had a flat tire repair done here.  Took about 20 minutes.  Turns out the rim was bent.  They shop bent it back to shape in no time and I was back on the road.  Gotta love those potholes on 580 at the Altamont pass.</review>< pics>

I bought two new tires from Big O and got them rotated for the first time a week ago and two days later got a flat!! From one of my other two that wasn't replaced ! I don't think they even inspected the tires to see if they have any holes or problems!! There are no holes or nails in it. They didn't put enough air on it so I drove it to the rim.
I will not be buying or getting service from them!!<//Text>

Pay close attention to what they quote you and what they actually write down. We needed a new starter they told my husband and i $250 out the door for parts and labor. It wasn't noticed until after we paid that they charged $370. That was not what was discussed but it was what they wrote on the paperwork. We felt it was extemely underhanded. Like they were just hoping we weren't paying attention. And unfortunately we weren't. We will not be back, and we will be informing everyone we know not to do busness there EVER!</Text>

I am what the couponing world would say a newbie. These little shopping trips are my  "me time" and its hard to enjoy when your constantly being looked at suspiciously and  followed. I shopped several times at this Walgreens but never felt comfortable. Its a bummer too because its the closest to my home.< /text>

<review>I'd say the staff are quite helpful and courteous. I've only had one pharmacy cashier be a bit curt to someone in front of me. I usually visit the pharmacy and flash my receipt to the checker in the front as I leave. I'm always greeted with a smile.</review>< Pictures>

The only pharmacy in town that could figure out how to run my insurance - I went to half a dozen locations, it was a nightmare because the medication was quite expensive. Special thank you to Marian T. She really went the extra mile, from finding my prescription plan and trying very hard to find any kind of way to help me. I'm very grateful, thank you.</review>

<review>Normally I always listen to the ratings so I wasn’t expecting great service. I’ve had a lot of trouble getting my medications but the pharmacy staff have been wonderful at working with me through the difficulties getting things authorized by the insurance. I felt very cared about there and I noticed they do the same for many others. I feel like rather than telling me there was nothing they could do and was not their problem (disconnected like so many are today), they actually took the time to call my doctor, talk to my insurance, and try to get everything all sorted out. Even if the rules were blocking me from getting me the medication I needed, they allowed me a few until everything got sorted through so I didn’t have to miss a dose. They are human and in a world full of beurocracy, this was a welcome surprise.<//review>< Pics>

I have been here multiple times, over several years. The store is as expected. However, when it comes to the pharmacy it seems very few, including the pharmacist, know what they are doing, along with a very poor attitude. It seems they always have an excuse as to why they cannot fill a prescription, at best for hours at worst days. Typically, when you bring in a prescription, you need it then not days later.< /Review>

<Text>The store is ok but my experience with the pharmacy is by far the worst. Poor customer service, long lines, staff is extremely unprofessional! The one on landless is so much better. The staff here definitely needs proper corporate training.</Text>< date>

Got a text about  11:00 saying RX was ready .About 5pm I went to pickup antibiotics for my granddaughter who had been discharged just that morning from emergency room.Many customers ahead of me and  after waiting in line for 15 -20 min. I was told by a pharmacist assistant that Doctor had made a mistake on RX and she needed to call him. I told her we needed the RX filled because Granddaughter  was in pain and she stated that she couldn't be in pain because she had been given pain meds that morning. (Implying that Granddaughter should be popping pain pills)
We asked for RX back so we could go elsewhere which is when she realized that
Doctor had faxed over a revised RX but that one had been filed away without being filled.
After waiting another 10 min I was given the the pills but not before being told that if that ever happened again I would have to wait the usual waiting time (which could be hours.) Seems mistakes happen often at this pharmacy!
I told her this was their mistake not mine and she proceeded to tell me to next time go to another store.
Mind you not once did she ever make eye contact with me . The whole time she proceeded to talk at me not with me.
She was not only unprofessional and rude but you could tell she was frazzled
by how busy it gets.
She definitely needs to get another job where she has no customer contact because after reading the other reviews I can see this behavior is being tolerated by the store.</text>

The service is ran by hurrying children and refills placed in the morning still consistently take 30 mins after you get there and check in. That's if YOU realize the time. They don't say nothing,  even when they say they will.
All this has happened over and over.
As I'm texting this another lady is complaining about the same thing and that it happens all the time. I found a CVS right around the corner (or many in the area)<//review>

They have you over a barrel.  We were in an accident late in the evening and they have a contract I guess, so we stuck with them. We were told that we would be able to get stuff out of car; but when we called to find out their hours , we were then told no- not until Monday ( accident was Friday night). We also couldn't pay and have it towed out of their yard. Forced to pay fees all weekend.< /review>

Our insurance company contacted this towing company due to a flat tire. They lied about when they would show up and then didn't respond to the insurance company again after confirming a tow. The wait time exceeded 2 hours at which time our insurance company had to call another. Waiting for over 2 hours with a no show! Terrible!<//review>

<Text>I was referred to them by my insurance for a vehicle lock out. The service man was late, never gave me courtesy call or anything to let me know they were coming. I had to call them to see what was going. By the end of it all, I waited for an hour and a half before the service man arrived, and when he did, he wasn’t wearing any mask or gloves. There is a pandemic going on, and this guy could get others sick if he isn’t already. Avoid this service at all cost, even they’re phone operator is horrible, made nothing by excuses for the driver and even blamed the costumers for not being ready for road side accidents. That’s disgusting, while that is true, no one can fully prepare or predict an accident or emergency. We need help, and reassurances, not judgement and excuses. The operator had no care or costumer service, she was completely heartless. Avoid them at all cost, these guys are not good.<//Text><resp>None<//resp><username>Paulo Quiatchon</username>< rating>

0613 dispatch call. Truck driver called around 0815 and showed up around 0830. Company was unwilling to accommodate for lost time. At least the driver was nice (he's the only reason that got 2 stars) .  I don't recommend this tow service.  I've used airport towing in the past and they are pretty good.<//Text>

Raymond at Nachos came to my rescue on behalf of Audi Roadside Assistance to put my spare on. He showed up quickly and got me back on the road safely, taking the time to help me find the tool to get the lug covers off and check my other tires to make sure they didn’t sustain damage.  Thank you for the excellent service!</text>

Worst experience ever! Today we got stranded in big bear and called nachos towing in Oxnard. They agreed to pick us up and tow us back to Oxnard within 3 hours! here we are 10 hours and still no tow truck! We called them several times and every time they had a different story.  they never bothered calling us to give us updates. the owner finally called us after several calls and stated that their truck broke down twice not one time did he show any concern for our family and instead stated that he was concerned about his truck and having to pay his driver over time. he also stated that if he were to pick us up he would be towing his truck and our car on top of the flat bed with us inside of it! Really??? Is that even legal?? After being stranded in the middle of nowhere for hours we finally were able to get another tow truck company that will be coming to pick us up! This was so upsetting n disappointing! More that the owner showed no concern for our family being left hanging for hours and them not communicating with us! We walked miles to try and get a hotel and there was no vacancy! Luckily we had some food n water in the car to feed our children n pets! After dark the only close by fast food restaurant closed and we had no access to a restroom or food! Wow the owner then tried  to say we misunderstood him, that he never mentioned being worried about paying OT! We are honest
N descent people and didn’t want to take it to this extreme; however, we wouldn’t want anyone to go through what we did! The owner asked us not to give his company a bad review, but the treatment we got was just so wrong! Thank you all for allowing me to vent! It hurt me to see my children n pets go through this and all the problems it caused our family!!!</text>

So thank your tow truck driver for his/her hard work, for delivering your car safe, and for doing it at the worst time for everyone.

John, I just got the parts together and I'll bring them by..

Absolutely the worst customer service I've ever experienced. I'm a licensed Vehicle Verifier and I have dealt with a lot of towing yards. Their requirements and procedures make customers jump thru hoops. The woman that answers the phone was entirely rude and unprofessional.  The fact they stay in business with kind of poor work etiquette and poor professionalism is mind blowing.</review>

Wonderful driver who came all the way to Rincon to pick up my parents when they lost their keys. He had to get their car out of a small area between 2 motorhomes, facing backward.
He was very professional and did it all very efficiently and quickly.</Review>

< Review>
Absolutely hands down the worst experience with any company I've ever had.  My first encounter with them I was forced to have to call the police bc one of the male tow truck drivers said I disrespected the the woman behind the counter bc when I was walking out from the office I said to myself this is bullsh#t
Which it totally was. And decided he was going to walk outside after me and get up in my face trying to fight me.  Seriously.  His nose touching mine I couldn't believe it.  I was there in the first place bc my car had been stolen days prior and recovered by Oxnard police and unfortunately taken there which is their the yard they are contacted with. It's not cause of something I did or somewhere I parked. My car was stolen and they treated me like I was the cause.  Their customer service is atrocious. The women who work in the office are rude, lazy, and beyond unprofessional.  Any way you might be imagining this right now I guarantee you not even close to as terrible as these people are.  But since they are contacted with the local police department they know they can do what ever and reviews won't hurt them a bit they'll always get work bc the police send them to them.    They aren't 24 hrs btw. The office is only open m-f 8 to 5 no way too pick up your car on weekends at all.  But they sure will charge you for it.  If you have to get your car towed.... And this place is your only option. Don't! Screw it!  Simply light it on fire and call it a loss. It won't be as bad as dealing with these people.<//Review>

< review>
The lady's behind the counter are very very rude! I also work for a towing company, and hate when i have to go there to pick up a car. To the point we're I told my dispatch not to send me there anymore. They make u wait over 1 hr to get ur car out after paying. And just lie to u saying "there getting car out" when there's no one there! They have to call driver in to release car! Those fat lady's need to learn how to operate a fork lift and leave the chips and soda down for 1min.  They treat ppl like trash there!  Hope u never have to deal with them.< /review>

Service was terrible no way can anyone working today is worth$15 per hr. Manager included. They have raised the price over and above the value you get. Go to a restaurant almost anywhere. Sorry for the negatives. Just called it like I saw it.<//Review>

I went to this location instead of the Cleveland one because they mess up my order Everytime. Hadn't been a problem with Howard until today, when my girlfriend and I both noticed we didn't have a receipt on our messed up order. I hate to say it but the location by the 145 highway is your best bet in Madera.

Update:
Some spicy taco, which is just jalapenos added. Are those doritos loco taco shells broken up instead of flamin hot fritos?< /Text>

<text>I try and continue to try to give this Taco Bell the benefit of the doubt. I assume it's just newer employees or too few staff. There are always people just standing there laughing and not doing anything. No one double checking orders or anything.

Every time I go, my order is wrong. Every. Single. Time. The food I do get is always extremely sloppy and no care is put into it, like sour cream on one side of the burrito in all the burritos. That is just one example. There are many more to list, but that could go on for a while.

I will not be going back to that Taco Bell ever again.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Online order to this location, app was easy to use. But, I get there no pepsi zero, 3/4 of cup full of ice, no beans and I ask for 4 sauce packets I get enough to last me a week... also they put the sticker for "safety sealed" but give it to you with no gloves or mask like thanks... I'm an online Karen cause of this location lol...< /text>

Good service and good people. It was hard to read the board, lights were out. It was after 5PM so little light. The prices are alright but not the best.</text>

Just left taco bell to eat my 6 tacos for 10.00 ? I paid and when I opened every bag of tacos there was a pencil size of meat and all lettuce, very little cheese, That was a 25c tacos not a 1.60 taco. What a rip off for a billion dollar company, Taco wagons are the way to go I guess. No more taco bell for my family. This is a sad day in this pandemic. By Toco Bell....< /review>

< Review>
Well I'm allergic to cinnamon so i swapped it for the chip and cheese but when picking up the order they refused to swap the twist for chips n cheese, and i ordered the burrito with light beans and extra beef and it was not light on the beans nor the extra beef the tortilla was dry hard tasted old stale. I ask for two mild sauces and got nothing. They were also unprofessional and very rude. This happens every single time I order from the howard road location in madera California< /Review>

We tried the new rolled chicken tacos. They're pretty good. My wife's chalupa was cold, but they made us a fresh one without argument and apologized for it. The store was clean and the customer service was great (when I ordered, the girl at the register combined several items in our order to make them into a combo and saved us some money😊).<//review>

The Taco Bell on Howard is somehow always a little better than the others.  Sunday, I picked up a lunch/snack for the 9 people (65+yrs) in my Bible Study class, no drinks.  I only spent $20 and there was a burrito left over!  Not quite the Fish&Loaves thing, but everyone felt Well Fed and filled!!   Thank you Jesus 😊</review>

So after a long day at work I am on my way home and stop and taco Bell for some food. I made my order and asked for sour cream on my taco ( for which I was charged 50cents) and I still got NO sour cream. EMPLOYEES need to learn how to follow customers requests since we're being charged for it.< /text>

How is it that they always manage to meet up my order whether they forget an item or not pay attention to the order. Don't get me wrong it's day food you post for what you get but honestly... EVERYTIME!!!<//Review>

The employees need to pay closer attention to the orders And ingredients I asked for no tomatoes and tomatoes were still found on both of my tacos and also the food was cold by the time I got home. (5min drive home).</review>

Taco bell is as its expected to be: tasty food with a variety of different options that at the end of the day aren't exactly the best for you.. but you'll still come back many times.

This particular taco bell is fairly clean at all times I've been there and is only really deadlocked busy when the high school next to it is getting out.< /review>

<Review>Favorite place to eat on my side of town. Cause the other taco Bell by rancho always has homeless people inside. BUUT what I didn't like is I ordered from doordash today jst to try it out, and the bag was not sealed at all and it was ripped. Please seal the bags even the drinks! That would be so much better.<//Review>< Response>

No matter how hard of an issue you have they will figure it out for you. They have registered golf cart, boats and vehicles for me without any issue. It's nice not to have to deal with DMV. There's never a wait and 99% of the stuff is done immediately. If you need a vin verification or even a reconstructed title they are you one stop shop. So nice to be able to support a local business and skip the lines.</Review>< Resp>

The staff is super friendly, the process is quick and efficient, and it beats the DMV on every level! They are open during this pandemic BUT are taking safety measures.

After working with Legacy Auto Registration twice in the last month, I’m sold. I do not plan on setting foot in the DMV, again, unless it’s something I can’t get done here.

From the convenience of not having to stand in long lines at the DMV, to the professional and exceptional service, I highly recommend Legacy Auto Registration for your DMV needs.< /text>

The service is excellent. Very friendly and very informative. Any questions I have, they have the answer to. I recommend this to anyone and everyone needs dmv services. Usually I wait over a month for my title to come from the dmv. Legacy auto registration gets me my title in two weeks or less every time! Excellent<//review>< Resp>

Sandra took care of my registration on a 1962 impala and if you know it is a very difficult process when it comes to classic cars, she was able to get everything done in record time, also very dependable. Legacy auto registration will now be my primary choice for all of my registration needs, Thank you again for the wonderful transaction.</review>

They were very proficient and knowledgeable with getting all the paperwork done. Such a breeze and so pleasant to work with. I drove away with registration, stickers, and plates in 15 minutes.

I’m not one to normally write reviews, however when you come across a business that above the rest you just want to share your experience.
Jessica and Sandra takes care of all my DMV needs for my Dealership. There knowledge all aspects of DMV is so helpful, especially when I might have a deal that is a bit complicated they have a way of simplifying and getting the job done!
I also will call on them to ask question they are always available and ready to help.
I’ve been in the car business for over 30 years and have worked with numerous agency’s
Legacy Auto Registration is by far the best !!!<//Text>

I love Legacy Auto Registration! My mom and I have been coming here starting this year and man do we not miss the DMV!! Always no line, they’re super fast, and can answer all your questions just like the regular DMV.
Today my registration was due and it only took them 5 mins to register and print it out, unlike DMV which takes hours of waiting.
Come here for all DMV needs!</Review>

Got some ice cream in a bubble waffle (pretty much a thin waffle with big air bubbles in it. It was quite good! Good quality ice cream.
Only thing I would change would be to serve the ice cream on top of a flat waffle on a plate or a bowl so the ice cream can melt over the waffle. Would also be easier to eat/less messy.
Also, the chocolate sauce tasted like Hershey’s chocolate syrup.  It wasn’t bad, I would just expect some sort of homemade fudge sauce for the price.</Text>

{'time': 1613797649129, 'text': 'Thank you Elise for the 4 stars and taking the time to leave us your feedback! We are very happy to hear that you enjoyed the bubble waffle. It’s become quite popular here at SWEET LAB. We apologize for any inconvenience concerning the sleeve in which the waffle was served in. However, this is traditionally how bubble waffles are served in Hong Kong (where it originated) and not on a plate. It’s also aesthetically more pleasing for customers who likes to take pictures. What most customers do is they’ll start by picking off the top part of the waffles and dip their ice cream or scoop with spoon. Then they would wrap the ice cream with the rest of the waffle (like a sandwich). The crispy outside, soft centered waffle with ice cream just makes for such an appetizing dessert. Although, we do understand your feedback and agree it would be less messy on a plate. Regarding the chocolate sauce, we do not use Hershey’s. We actually use DaVinci Gourmet and liked the smooth and rich chocolate taste better than most chocolate sauces in comparison. We really appreciate your time and thank you for checking us out. We will continue to do our best to improve our products and services. Look forward to seeing you again soon!'}</Response>

However, something piqued my interest while I was there. One of the staff told me I looked really familiar, and asked where I went to elementary school. I was sort of ambigious in my response: "I'm not from around here.", although I went to Reed Elementary in San Jose, and she seemed oddly familiar too. If she can read this, I'd like to get back to her on that, if I come by again.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1620485651038, 'text': 'Thank you Johnny for the 5 stars rating and kind review!

<Response>{'time': 1619229182030, 'text': 'Hi CJ, bummed that you couldn’t leave us a higher review when we did have popping boba available for you and considering you love our tea. Unfortunately, there is an industry shortage on boba supplies so it’s really out of our control. Suppliers have limit all boba shops across the nation on the amount we can order and in some cases they’re just completely out of stock. However, you’ll be pleased to find that we were able to restock on the Mango Popping and Strawberry Popping today. You’ll also find that we’ll be offering other toppings and flavors to replace any shortages in the meantime. A new topping we are now offering is the Lychee Popping which we trust, you and your family will enjoy. We kindly ask that our customers are understanding and continue to support us rather than just leave during this challenging time. Regarding wait times, if there are no customers ahead of you, a Mango Berry Tea takes no more than a couple mins at most to prepare. Many customers have complained about wait times but very few understand that we make your drinks fresh upon order. To maintain the quality of our drinks, we have zero premixed or pre-made drinks. So if you’re visiting during a rush or if there happens to be a few drinks ahead of your order, wait times will vary and extended during weekends or rush hours. Lastly, we regret to hear that you did not receive friendly customer service during your visit(s). We pride ourselves in offering great customer service and will be sure to remind our team to continue doing so. We hope to provide you with a better experience on your next visit and will look forward to seeing you and your family.'}<//Response>< pictures>

<text>Love the mango berry tea with popping boba, it's usually my family's go to. The last few times we went we had extremely long wait times and the last time they were completely out of both flavors of popping boba. I was very surprised a boba shop would be out of any bobas so I left empty handed and went home. This place is pretty good but I feel like the staff could be friendlier and they should hire more people to get things done faster so people don't have to wait almost 20 minutes for some tea.</text><Name>C J</Name></record></dataset><record>

Nice location with tons of parking.

Good choice of flavors and staff is pretty friendly and fast.
Price is around the normal range for boba drinks.
There are other desserts to try as well.</review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>You know that feeling when you go to an ice cream shop excited and ready, then they give you a scoop that barely qualifies as a scoop. I'm happy to report it's the opposite here. They're generous with their delicious scoops. Ice cream is fun and delicious and you get all that here. Perfect creamy ice cream.

They have many unique flavors. One of my favorites is honey lavender. It's phenomenal in my opinion. If everyone sat down and enjoyed a scoop of honey lavender ice cream we'd have world peace. I'm sure of it. All the hate and bitterness in the world would simply melt away.

The service here is equally great. Particularly the guy working here. He's kind and gratefully for your business.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

{'time': 1609998331691, 'text': 'Thank you Emily for the 4 stars rating and review. All drinks are made fresh upon order so there will be some wait. It also depends on how many drinks or items are on each order ahead. Wait times are extended during rushes or when it’s busy as you mentioned and especially during weekends. We apologize for any inconvenience. Your appreciation of us being in Lodi means a lot to us. It’s the reason why we decided to open our first business here. To bring the town something fresh and new, so thank you for appreciating what we have to offer. Regarding modified hours, we have been open 1pm to 8pm since COVID. We are hoping to go back to normal hours 12pm to 9pm sooner than later. Thank you again for your feedback and understanding. We will continue to work hard and improve in all aspects of our business.'}</resp>
< review>
I want to rate lower because it's rediculous how long you wait for one drink and the people pile up in line waiting to order while it takes so long for one order to be made. Also they open pretty late. Me and my family always want to get boba drinks with our lunch for my mom's lunch break, but they open like an hour too late for us to do that. But I just can't rate it lower than four stars, because I love having boba tea and yummy Asian desserts in Lodi, my small home town, the kind of thing I usually only get to have in the bay area. And though the orders are extremely (almost unacceptably) slow, the workers are always super nice.</review>

Very sweet, large scoops of ice cream and the texture is unique. Unique flavors and flavored cones too! Their green tea ice cream stained my lips and teeth greenish-blue. The service was very slow but that is possibly due to the small staff.< /Text>

{'time': 1560293659669, 'text': 'Thank you for the 4 stars rating and feedback.  We will continue to work on improving our product and services. We have to store our ice cream at a lower temperature as we serve them in warm desserts such as the bubble waffle.  Therefore, it makes it harder and takes a little longer to scoop, than normal ice cream. We do apologize for the wait.  Good news is we will be adding to our growing team to help with the overall customer experience.  Regarding the ice cream staining, this is normal.  We try and offer our customers a variety of ice cream experiences at Sweet Lab. Some of the flavors we offer are more traditional while others are more fun or interesting. All of our ice cream is made with approved food safe ingredients but some flavors do include artificial coloring, a common practice in the food industry. The green tea ice cream does include some green and black food coloring and is completely safe to eat. Thanks for visiting our shop and trying our ice cream. We hope to see you again soon 😊'}<//response>

I'm obsessed with the Taro Coconut it's not too sweet and that coconut infused taste. Mmm makes my mouth water. I've gone two times now and always a great experience.

First of all, this place has really interesting desserts and I'm really excited to try them all. I ordered a Horchata Frappe and it was really good! Place was still extremely busy but costumer service... Cashier made me feel like she was looking at something disgusting, hence the 3 star rating. I'm going to remain positive and attribute that to stress and being too busy and will try to return at a later date when everything calms down.< /Review>

While we recognize that boba may not be for everyone, we wouldn’t term it gross. We would love the opportunity to make up for your experience. Since you do not like boba, please stop by for a drink on the house and try a different drink topping. We have a variety of popping bobas and jelly that you may like. They are displayed in small cups for you to choose from. Please stop by and give any employee your name and ask for a Manager. We will be sure to comp your drink.

In short, there are many items that need to be resolved for this place to stay in business. The quality of their product will make me a repeat customer, but the frequency of my visits will depend on their ability to overcome their many flaws.

My family visited twice on opening day--once at noon and again at 6:30PM. In both cases, there were less than six people in line and we waited over 20 minutes each time to just place our order. After ordering the first time, our drink order was fulfilled in under 5 minutes. During our evening visit, we waited 15 minutes for our ice cream after ordering. The wait time the second time around was due to the lack of employees, and one person playing "one man band" behind the counter (answering questions from both customers and the untrained cashier, giving samples, scooping ice cream, calling out orders, and running cups back and forth from the register to the kitchen).

The things that need to change ASAP and shouldn't cost the company significant dollars:
- Two employees (cashier and "runner") are not enough to take care of customers. Have more staff behind the counter to answer questions, provide ice cream samples, and start taking drink/ice cream orders before customers reach the cashier. During slower hours, these employees can also clean the bathrooms, empty trash, and interact with customers (rather than just apologize for taking so long). Doing the little things goes a long way for the customer experience.
- Train your cashiers on how to use the POS system properly. This creates a large bottleneck.
- Have your drink stickers print directly to the kitchen area. Currently, the labels print at the cashier, they have to put the labels on cups, and then have them run them to the kitchen window (about 15-20 feet away).

Changes that would be nice:
- If things remain busy, run two cash registers.
- Widen the section for those standing in line. There is currently very narrow standing room and it would be a nightmare for someone with claustrophobia or young kids.
- Open earlier. People may not want ice cream at 10:00am, but they will definitely would drink boba tea at that time.
- Stay open later (til 9:00 or 10:00pm?). Your most likely demographic is 15-30 year olds---think about it. Most boba shops in the area stay open until 9-11pm on weeknights
- Add a Vietnamese Iced Coffee DRINK to the menu. The VIC ice cream is awesome... but I'd come back 3x a week if there was a drink to go with it.
- Don't charge customers extra for adding a regular boba. "Boba" is in your name, yet you add an up-charge when people want it in their drink. Specialty add-ins deserve to be marked up.
- Add a customer loyalty program to reward repeat visitors.
- Don't raise your drink prices. Currently Sweet Lab is on the high end of pricing for their teas. Most of your competitors are charging $2.75-3.50 for regular sized milk tea (boba included) with an extra $0.50-0.75 if they are ordering a larger size.
- Run regular specials. This can encourage new customers to come in and get returning customers to try new drinks/ice creams.

I plan to go again in the next several days and hopefully will be able to change my review for the better. With the right changes, this local business should be able to thrive!<//text>

Amazing place to try out boba, and I like the flavors that they have, my only concern is that i wish that it could stay open more often and try to hire more workers to help with the process as I can feel that the place would be more crowded the more popular it becomes, Maybe if more workers can come in then the place will improve. (Also please be noted that your competing with a dutch bros and Menchies with your place)<//Review>

I went around 4 PM on a Tuesday and the baked goods were almost completely gone. I ordered a Chocolate Croissant, which was yummy. It tasted fresh with a dark chocolate filling. The prices seemed fair and the on-site parking was an added bonus. I'd be open to going back, but in the morning to see the full offering.< /review>

<review>The baked goods merchandised in this bakery’s display case will no doubt tantalize your senses.

Speaking from experience.

This was my first visit, and I knew I was in for a treat when at a 10 a.m. on a Friday there was a line out the door. Lines are usually a promising sign of a good business. And the experience was worth the wait.

Indeed, this bakery serves a diverse selection of upscale pastries and other gastronomic delights.

On your visit you can expect to see huge cookies with eclectic and traditional flavors, croissants, scones, brioche, muffins, and more.

In addition to fresh baked bread there are paninis and other sandwiches available for lunch.

In spite of all that above, I have only had the Quiche of The Day. It was ham, egg, and cheddar cheese, and it was good. IMO, it would have been much better hot or at least lukewarm, but instead it was served at room temperature.

The lady taking my order said they weren’t able to heat it due to COVID-19.

Aside from that, good experience.
The prices can be on the dear side, as in “oh dear!”.
So don’t be surprised if a huge cookie or a single slice of quiche cost  $6.00.

All in all, 4.4 stars out of 5, or said another way, an 88 out of 100.

Final thought and tip.
If your new to the area consider walking to Alamo Square Park which is home to the iconic Painted Ladies and about a 8 minute walk south on Steiner St. That way you get a taste of a local bakery, sightsee, stretch your legs and walk off whatever calories you’ve picked up from Jane’s Bakery.

Whatever your choice, I hope you enjoy.
Stay safe and cheers to your next discovery.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLx1G1JSHFr3i-7zX0fDubbkNcBNtxZeimm-6Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNi2JaXVyhJqhzen4XKS4in5gNH4RilVi8Tjpjb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHXY_bbyl0uPPX6Ax2zSMtA9ZIJwPXDM4WTtHW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOB_mVBBpksXcWjc1iRIQtrxjdekkGORNDMwfdf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxv1X3SpCO_PVSqYdabz0W14HJkfUcbOB8Q5oQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqQRN42KhrdoBkH_8HE1yW7xYFQRPUFtqm-AWy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8tpAgQmbtU0l6e3lXxoSrGf8mEMpBd9tKkxlj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2XGEJxBArHG4y8kOt5OiOyOIs4-rPzIXJ-dzn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfZ_dd5if3-6yyfSB5cQlpd1WR-3Jrc_GwwdiU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM20DdoT_1OTMv6I0W9g_DMqmF4yubSVG2N5j2H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPk963FO-OrV2J-Yx1rGHJWtybtfSsW92De072Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOfssYILLHXR93em19Qf99DAag6J-4q14hYbVl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><name>G<//name><rating>4< /rating><Time>1618713557806</Time><user>110170593638407303282<//user><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Review>I’ve literally been to Jane’s 4 times since the first time I went a few weeks ago and it’s amazing. I love the bustling, open kitchen vibe of the place. On weekends the line will most likely be out the door but it moves fast. They also have a few spots in the parking lot in front and several spots of cheap metered parking adjacent to their lot. They have bread, pastries, cakes, a variety of loaves, and the most amazing sandwiches made with their own bread (sandwiches made with fresh bakery bread makes a world of a difference.) Their cakes are unbelievably moist and tender, and not overly sweet. The things I’ve tried that I would recommend are: roast beef and turkey sandwiches on multigrain sliced bread, mango chicken salad on a baguette, lemon loaf (so moist and flavorful), black cocoa bundt cake, and brunch croissant (and any of their laminated pastries).</Review>< rate>

Line was pretty long here, but it moved quickly.  The selection is out of this world.  They have everything!  Here is what I tried:
Monkey Bread - Good
Cookies - Very Good
White Cheddar Pretzel - Great
And we bought even more stuff to try!  So good.<//Text>

Very sweet staff. Loved trying out their gluten free sourdough (with a good selection of cheeses to pair!) and raspberry muffin. Cute little park across the street to sit and eat!< /text>

I've been to this bakery several times. I love their olive oil and olives twist pastry. I try to get it every time I visit if it isn't sold out. On weekends there is usually a line and currently during COVID-19, they limit 6 customers at a time in the store. They have a small parking lot that can accommodate less than 10 cars, otherwise there is metered parking near by. On our latest visit on a Saturday at 10am, we waited 20 minutes to get inside. It's true that their pastries do not have prices in the store but it can be viewed on their website. In general they are between $4-$5 each. I've never had any bad customer service experience with any of the employees. Their selection is big from cookies, to cakes, pastries, and sandwiches. On occasion they will have seasonal items. Their eggnog kouign amann is amazing and this is coming from someone who doesn't like to drink eggnog.<//Review>

I love Jane - both the Larkin & Geary locations! I buy their Bread & Butter coffee and they ground it for me for my percolator. I really enjoy the taste of their coffee, and unfortunately my taste buds can now tell when I don’t have yummy café! 😩 So there is no going back!< /review>

<review>OBSESSED. Jane is my fav bakery in the bay full stop. Every loaf of bread is a winner, but the olive + polenta is on another level. Makes a killer fried egg breakfast toast. The pastry case is nothing but bangers. If you haven’t had the fig-cherry-chocolate bread twist, trust me on this- it’s more delicious than it has any right to be. Try one asap. You’re welcome.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Gmap_id>

I've never seen people so rude before. The woman working at the time had no respect or patience for the customers. She defended her rudeness by saying its for "social distancing" while I was following the guidelines better than she was. No idea how the food was but if it's as good as the service, a dumpster serves better food.< /Text>

One of the most pleasant surprises I've experienced, was stumbling into this little bakery when I first moved into the neighborhood.  Since then, it's been a borderline dangerous addiction living only 2 blocks away.

The things that I would do for their sourdough and monkey bread... Let's just say wouldn't be too appropriate to leave as a google review.< /Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Jane the bakery is my favorite bakery in the bay area. The items there are not overly sweet and have a complexity of flavor that is lacking in other bakeries. You can gauge the quality of a bakery by their croissant, and Jane the bakery has one of the best croissants in the bay. It’s on the same level as the Fournee bakery croissant in Berkeley.<//Review>< Pictures>

In my opinion, the best bakery in America. Croissant, chocolate croissant, baguette, whole wheat sourdough - in four crowded categories, they come out at the top. Then you add in good coffee and sandwiches, PLUS like 50 amazing pastries that just they make, and it becomes clear why this is the gold standard of bakeries anywhere.<//review>

Great bread! They run out pretty quickly so try to go early :) They usually have several different kinds but lately only sourdough has been available.
Pastries are good too! I particularly enjoy their regular croissant.

Downside: a lovely place in a sketchy neighborhood. Prices are high but nothing new in San Francisco!</Text>

<Review>This was my favourite bakery in San Francisco. Everything was delicious and the bakery had a very relaxed and cool vibe. Their coffee was also very good. The pastry is amongst the most perfect I’ve found in the US. Lots of people seem to come past on their way to work in the morning. The breads also looked amazing.<//Review><time>1571601754060<//time>< userid>

Awesome bakery and brunch spot easy to park and great for after a bike ride. The food is amazing and the lines are not as hectic as Jane on Fillmore. Kind of in a random area though - but worth it. Definitely visit!!< /Review>

<Text>Mocha $5: 6/10
Cinnamon roll $5.5: 7/10

Verdict: plain Jane, nothing was wow we had to go back. Their packaging design was nice, but service and taste was not worth the price. Mocha contained loads of milk in it that it hardly tasted like coffee.

What's annoying me the most was their employees were allowed to use their phone when they are working. One literally walked away from the counter when I was about to order after getting a nudge from his phone. Another was periodically checked on her phone while I was waiting for my order making by her.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlQs6teXXLEELfbAGW4QfkDJso4JGIedaJCC5u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUej_IBOf9To-C_8w8MRnnYrD5cOIcnrPzCr3p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<Text>Plain croissant, cardamom cream croissant... Literally every pastry I’ve had from this place is delicious. Of the top tier bakeries in SF, the difference among them is slight, but Jane the Baker absolutely deserves to be in that tier. The parking lot on Geary is pretty small, the line might be long, but they keep the customers moving.<//Text><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808580b9c8e6d781:0xc66d155748e1a74b< /gmapID></record>

<Response>None</Response><Text>Tried out the Mango Chicken sandwich, didn’t like it, tasted more like chicken curry. But i really liked the bread they use at this place, fresh & toasty. They also sell pastries, like Strawberry Brioche tarts, gonna try that next time. Really friendly staff. Really clean too.

<text>Get there early for the best selection.  I appreciate them for donating to health workers through these difficult times.  I came to support them.  Skip the plain croissant and go for the double baked almond croissant. I got the slice of carrot loaf bread with ver visible walnuts.  I was told by friend that it was very hearty and filling.  Everything looked delicious.  Can't go wrong with free parking in front and short lines. The bread selection looked very rustic.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Holy moly! You walk in and you just see the most incredible array of baked goods! Beautiful, artisan bread of every variety, shape and size! Wanting to get a simple taste of this location I got a pain au chocolat which apparently is award-winning. Very rich and flavorful. I just wish I would’ve chosen a black coffee to go with it! Easily worth a visit!</text>

Everything awesome in terms of bread BUT! once I ordered a coffee, it tasted like dishwater, incredibly weak, to cover it up they made it 90% milk. I took it back in to fix it. Older gentlemen, barista guy acted a little annoyed. Hey you guys don't skimp on the coffee, you charge enough, when a person stands in a line behind 10 people and starving, I want real coffee, not some rebrewed Santa.I drink it with my pastries at the park across the street.  Pastries? delicious! real old world quality! BUT, a little over priced. Also, one time I ordered a sour dough baguette, and everyone in Northern Cali is used to Primo dour dough, you guys slipped a sweet baguette on me, I didn't realize it till I got home. Please. Never do that. we know the difference, instantly.<//Text>

Best bread in SF! Love the density and tartness of the multigrain loaf. So sweet that they will sell you a half loaf too (just ask!). Cookies are the BOMB (the captain crunch cookie is eerily true to taste, but with all the buttery chewy goodness of a cookie :)).

Four stars because the coffee is a little acidic for my taste and the pastries do not live up to their aesthetics (too doughy/bready for me, I like flaky pastry). The much hyped cardamom bun had lovely filling and is a creative idea, but the dough prevented me from enjoying it. Toasts are a cute idea, but on bread that is already darkly browned, I found my fig ricotta toast to be too singed to really savor.

Have not tried the gargantuan sandwiches, salads, or cakes... they’re on the list!<//text>

Skip the line at Arsicault and pick up treat for yo friends here.  Pricing is shall we say premium, but that's how it rolls at any well-known bakery in SF.< /review>< Pics>

My favorite bakery in the entire city! Always numerous flavorful and delicious pastres, treats, and breads. Good coffee for early in the day and good readymade sandwiches and salads for lunch.
Plus, there's an old KFC bucket on a pole to mark my fav Jane location in the Fillmore.< /text>

<Text>This pandemic has got me searching for comfort food, and waiting in line at Jane the Bakery is worth every second! I've sampled about half of their selection of baked goods, and I've not been disappointed with a single item.

Their pain au chocolat is so buttery and decadent, and pairing it with their cappuccino is a great start to any day.</Text>< Resp>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Before leaving the city to head back to Sacramento, my friends and I stopped at Jane the bakery to pick up some treats. There was a tremendous line but it moved quickly. I can only imagine all of the baked items people were purchasing for the upcoming Christmas holiday.

I ordered a baguette, a loaf of brioche bread, and almond croissant, and a spicy sausage croissant. The baguette will be for my cheese and charcuterie platter for Christmas. The brioche bread will be for a French toast casserole for Christmas morning.

But the almond croissant was a delicious treat for the ride home. This place has hands-down the best almond croissant I have ever had in California. And I scour bakeries looking for almond croissants.

It's a good thing I do not live in the city or else I would be at this bakery every morning buying myself delicious baked items.<//review>< Pics>

<review>I come here every single weekend. My wife loves the cheddar chive biscuits and you can.never go wrong with a croissant and coffee.

You can get whole or half loaves of different breads. They're all to die for but I love the fig walnut for french toast.

You can also get breakfast or lunch sandwiches.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Best bakery in the city I’ve been to, but the ordering process and space in which to do so can be tight, effecting the convenience of ordering.  I feel like I have to yell my order often times.  Still, such great products can be worth more the (often times) rushed, ordering process.  I wish Jane’s had a bigger facility.<//text>

They have great brunch specials during the weekends.

I got the croissant and it was sooo good. Really buttery and crunchy.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808580b9c8e6d781:0xc66d155748e1a74b</Gmap_id><time>1538328053836< /time><Rate>5</Rate>< Name>

Cute bakery in the Filmore. There was a long line on the weekend morning we went, but it moved fairly quickly. They had a wide selection of gorgeous bread, pastries, and drinks. We ordered a croissant, the Fig Walnut with ricotta and honey, and the Avosmash. We also got a banana bread to take home and a kombucha from the readymade fridge section. I saw many customers also grabbing salads from the front. My favorite was the croissant (the others were good but everything else seemed more interesting after tasting them) so next time I think I'll try more pastries and take home some bread.</Text>

< Review>
Wonderful bakery offering a huge variety of baked goods. Fantastic pastries, cookies, and other sweets. They also have a great assortment of fresh breads and also offer food items like breakfast sandwiches which are very generous and delicious.
The location is not very conspicuous and the outside of the bakery doesn’t have a lot of signage. I actually confused it for an old KFC when I first moved to the neighborhood because of an old awning on the side. But I think that people who live nearby are becoming more aware of it and I would definitely recommend trying any of their items. It would be worth the trip.
The earlier you get there, the better!< /Review>

This is a delightful bakery. Not only are their basic croissants and breads top notch, they also are very creative with flavors, both savory and sweet. A croissant dough tart with carrots and goat cheese and a hint of curry and thyme suggests a Thanksgiving flavor. Their citrus tart isn't just straightforward lemon with meringue, it also has a hint of raspberry, grapefruit, and rosemary in the crust, which worked amazingly well together. The avocado toast is so much more than just avocado. I would rate this as one of the 3 best bakeries in SF. The only downside is not much room to sit down and eat, hopefully it's a nice day and you can eat your pastries in the park across the street.<//Review>

<Time>1579278731214<//Time><Review>Latte $4. 3 out of 5
Croissant 4.5 out of 5. The last .5 can be granted if a darker chocolate is used and slightly less butter. Overall a fantastic croissant with a very fluffy interior and flakey outer layers. These guys are huge!
There's about 10 bar seats with a window ledge. Not a great place to write or work but good for solo contemplation. Views are not particularly inspiring but there are about 10 parking spaces if you're lucky.</Review>< user>

Yes yes YES!!! I am OBSESSED with Jane! I only wish there was one closer to where I'm living now.

The baked goods are so fresh and everything always looks amazing. Sure, it's expensive, but this is SF and the excellent quality of food makes it more than worth it.

The Nutty Bird bread is one of my personal favorites. Give it a try!</review>

<review>Jane the Bakery is exquisite. Where was Jane when I lived in San Francisco? I would have gotten all my gifts there, especially baked goods for the office. The fresh muffins, fresh breads, all the baked goods are extremely beautiful, shining with glaze, but moist, delicate, and with a divine taste. The aroma is outstanding with the sweet combining with coffee. I was walking with my son through the old neighborhood while playing the tourists from Las Vegas, Nevada. I came looking for an old bookstore cafe in the area. I was surprised to see so much sophistication in this community bakery.< /review>< pics>

Friendly staff. Good pastry selection. Interior design isn’t too bad, but don’t work with the aesthetics of the exterior. Small seating area. Huge parking lot. They also serve pretty good sandwiches.</Text>

SO delicious, and their coffee is addictive. Only thing is they have minimal bar seating and a few outdoor benches, best for takeout.</Review>

I have visited Jane a few times and have enjoyed my experience every time. This past time was busier than the usual but there were still quite a few pastries and breads available. The space is nice and clean. I grabbed a box of pastries to go and everything was good when consumed.< /review>

< Review>
I have been here 4 times. The croissants are excellent, perfect. The choices of breads, great--I have tried three different kinds and they are also delicious and excellent. I love the smoked salmon croissant. This morning I got my usual butter croissants (always take some home for the next days!) but also tried a ginger cookie--they are outstanding--tender, crisp edges with sugar, fluffy on inside with chewy, candied or dried ginger--OMG! Completely addicting. This is currently my favorite bakery, anywhere. The savory scones are excellent and so too, the vegetarian quiche. Always friendly, attentive service. Just can't say enough good stuff about the stuff I put in my mouth from The Jane.< /Review>

Not bad, had a pretty amazing Buckwheat Pan de Chocolate, but severely overpriced for the size and quality, coming in at a whopping $5 a pastry. Would not recomend unless one has excessive amounts of money to drop on something as simple as pastries.</text>

Really nice locally made pastries and fresh bread.
Not the prettiest views and sitting area is small but it's a bakery not a cafe (although the coffee is great too). Recommended.<//Review>

<text>Awesome bakery with a wide assortment of  croissants, brioches, danishes, muffins and other goodies.   Also got a sesame bread.  It was fresh and had an excellent crispy crust.   Why did it take me so long to find this place?  Sooooo good.</text>< Pictures>

Predominantly sells pastries and sweets.
Yummy!
Humongous!
Soft!
Creamy!
And numerous choices of pasties, out of this world flavors!

They also provide sandwiches, deli meats and loafs of 🍞.

Plus helpful and attentive staff thank you!

If you are on a strict healthy regimen and don't appreciate a shop like this, turn around and dont even try to give this place a low star review, you are not welcomed.<//review>

I have gone here a handful of time and it's by far my most favored  bakery in the entire City.  If you are interstead in trying baked goods that are not the the usual fair of most cafes and really are seeking new breads and pastry, then this place is for you.</Text>

Their breads are absolutely amazing, especially the fig and walnut one 🤤 Another fantastic item is the brunch pastry with egg in it, it's sooo good 😍👌the sweet pastries are good, but didn't impress as much as the breads and egg pastry.< /Text>

The coffee is perfectly fine and the sourdough toast was very good. Being something of a toast obsessive, I think it would have been tastier as a slightly thicker cut. Also the butter was very pale and lacked flavor. The gold standard of toast in SF remains The Mill...<//review>

<Review>A beacon of hope in the hopelessly hot week we spent in town (we were there for the record-setting high temp in August 2017). Every single thing we got, from the croissants to the cappuccinos, was wonderful. Even if we're staying halfway across town next time we visit, I'll make it a point to stop in.</Review>< date>

Reasonable prices and very delicious and different pastries, I got a curry pumpkin one that was really yum. They serve sandwiches around an hour before closing, and they’re the same company as Jane on Fillmore and Jane on Larkin. It’s in a safe area even though it might look kind of grungy or sketch, but if it’s night time just try to avoid Eddy x Fillmore (the McDonald’s across the street from the police station) since there are parallel streets you can take (eg go west)< /review>

<Text>Delicious croissants and cookies. I look forward to trying more of the baked goods. Strong coffee. They have some sandwiches. Only tall metal stools and a window counter for seating so go to the park across the street and picnic.<//Text><gmap_id>0x808580b9c8e6d781:0xc66d155748e1a74b<//gmap_id>< time>

The best. Even in SF, the general level of baked goods is average at best. Jane is the only place I have found  that makes a real croissant,  instead of greasy, soft,  oversized pastry rolls.

I wish Jane made bagels. Lost souls eat torus shaped white bread  paste from outlets like Noah's, under the sad delusion they are being served bagels. Unfortunately, proper bagel making requires a separate line, as well as an audience who wants bagels.

Jane, among other things, should be considered an important educational asset for our community.< /Text>

I wandered into Jane The Bakery by accident and discovered kouign amann and was hooked after the first bite.  When I brought my fiance and he too fell in love with the wide selection of interesting and delicious pastries and breads, I knew we'd found something special.  We keep going back, not just for the amazing food, but also because the staff are an amazingly diverse group of professionals spanning race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and gender expression.  It's a truly magical San Francisco place and we'll continue to support this local LGBT-affirming business.< /Review>

The location of this bakery isn't great. Right in front of Geary. It's like eating breakfast at a freeway stop. The bread is of quality, but $3 for a baguette (half size), $9 for a loaf of bread or $5.10 for a chocolate croissant is abusive. The chocolate croissant is heavy, and not so tasty. The loaf was good. Baguette is average. But I won't return, the location and prices don't make this an enjoyable experience.< /text>

< Review>
This brand new addition to Jane's two coffee shops is overdue. A shop focused on artisan bakery items, made of high quality ingredients, much like B Patisserie just a couple of blocks North.

My absolute favorite here is the multigrain bread - coming from Germany I can tell you I do miss my proper bread, and this delicious piece lives up to my standards. For your sweet tooth Jane The Bakery also offers fantastic pastries - the Danish is stunning!

On top of it - there is parking. Can't beat that!<//Review>

<text>Went in because they offered food. Be careful however if you order any sandwich with meat that is suppose to be heated. They have no source to heat anything after 5. When I asked a second time they said there was nothing they could do and actually told me I should leave because they were closing in a couple of minutes. I just ordered this sandwich to dine in and they did not tell me this when I ordered. They were sweet in response but actually quite condescending. If I get sick I’ll be upset.<//text><gmapID>0x808580b9c8e6d781:0xc66d155748e1a74b< /gmapID>< user>

OMG... this place is the bomb! Thank you for opening one so close to my place. Jane is my  “TRAP” house; I have an addiction for everything they make. The more I have the more I want. They are also Dog friendly which is a def’ a plus and their staff are pretty friendly!< /Review>

What is it with SF bakery burning their pastries.  First Tartine, and now Jane.

I got the last Kouign-Amann in the case when I arrived around 1 pm.  Place was pretty empty so there wasn't any wait.  The kouign-amann was way too burn so it was really bitter to eat.< /review>

<review>You come here for the bread and the amazing pastries, not here to hang out. If you are in the mood of having a nice toast (such as the Avocado Smash) or take home a loaf of bread, you won’t be disappointed.

One minor nit is that you form the line in front of the display of pastries. Then you get to the register but need to go back to point what you want, and back to the register to pay. It’s a bit cumbersome if this is your first time in and/or there are a lot of people in line.

Aside from this minor nit, endulge visiting Jane for great kouign-amann, or super flaky croissants, and great coffee and toasts to go.</review><gmap_id>0x808580b9c8e6d781:0xc66d155748e1a74b<//gmap_id>< Time>

< Review>
Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon, not too many people so line wasn't too long. They had a variety of baked goods and to go lunches. For some reason the prices were not posted so it was hard to know how much things cost. The space itself is fairly small, like it was meant to be a to go kind of place, not a place to sit and enjoy coffee and pastries.

We got 4 pastry items, all of which were ok, not bad, not great. For close to $19 tho, we felt it was overpriced and didn't deserve another visit. I'd instead visit Japantown 2 blocks away where for $19 you could almost get a sit-down meal for 2.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It is a croissant with a different feeling from tatin. The crunchy part is less and the inside is more moist

<Review>(Translated by Google) Bakery as in France baguette, raisin breads and chocolatines for connoisseurs. A little expensive because the local baker for us is an almost luxury store for Americans.
