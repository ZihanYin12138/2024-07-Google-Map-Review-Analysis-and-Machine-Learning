<review>Hands down, Laura is exceptional employee. We came to get a storage space and she was so nice to show few units so we could know all our options. She was very patient, supportive and looked like she loved what she was doing. You can rarely fine such dedicated, motivated and hard working employees in such businesses. Thank you for your great service A+++</review>< Pics>

We rented this unit six years ago for parents' stuff. Put the Public Storage lock on it and two siblings kept the two keys (and marked them).  No one's ever been back until today. When we went to open it, the key wouldn't fit. The Clerk On Site insisted we had the wrong key (it's identical to the Public Storage keys) and that "their system would show if we changed the lock and we would have notified you." After 4 hours of driving home to look for other keys, and to the sibling's house for a possible other key and finally paying $140 for a locksmith, when we opened the door, there was OUR OLD LOCK still attached to the OLD LATCH HARDWARE sitting on the floor in our unit. And it fit our key. We could tell the locks/latches had all been changed in all the hallways because you could see where the old latches had been removed.

Update 2 days later: The General Manager called us to let us know that the OLD OWNER/MANAGEMENT had changed locks 4 years ago and sent everyone a letter. Obviously not a registered letter because we never received it and their system wasn't updated to show new locks were installed everywhere. The PRESENT MANAGEMENT has repaid us for the locksmith, and given us some restitution. The current manager was very understanding of the trouble this had caused us and wanted us to be satisfied with the outcome.  He got to the bottom of what had happened before he came onto the job.< /text>

First time coming to this location and I need to pay my storage bill. Laura the manager greeted me with a warm welcome. She seemed very interested in my wellbeing. The office was clean and she made sure offer sanitizer after my use of things. It was a easy and smooth time. I would come back I had a great experience!

Thank you Laura your the best !!<//review>

<text>Due to the pandemic I had to move some of my offie supplies into storage. I contacted public storage they had a unit available for rent...  From my experience these days it is hard to find good customer service. Customer service has taken a complete backseat....until I meet the front desk person at public storage on Roscoe...her name is Laura.... her customer service skills were through the roof  It was such a pleasure to experience  I felt compelled to  show her how much I appreciated her customer service skills, so I went out and bought a snack pack of goodies for her ...just to let her know How much I appreciated the way she handled me as a customer  she is truly a dying breed. I'm so glad we picked this location. If she could teach her skill level  This world would make it through this pandemic a little bit better... I wish I was allowed to give her more  that 5 Stars...</text><Rate>5< /Rate>< username>

Went in to pay my grandmother account. Laura the prorety manager greeted me and was very helpful. I love the fact that she kept social distance and was taking the messurements to keep the environment clean after every guest. One person at a time in the office and she sanitized after. It was a quick and confertable transaction.</Text>

I had a positive experience at this location. It’s clean and the worker there was so nice and helpful. I believe her name was Angie, she was so polite I wish all the public storage employees were like her 5/5 :)</Review>

Updating my review again. The staff at this particular location is very nice and helpful, I pretty much always end up running afoul of the corporate policies, which are automatic. But between this staff, their district, and regional manager it does get straightened out and I appreciate that.<//text>

Great customer service. Cool and chill. Very low-key storage spot and Ron got my boyfriend and I just the right storage space right off the bat! Thanks Ron, you’re the man 🤙🏽👌🏽< /text>

<text>Out of all the public storage locations in California this one is by far the best. The service is spot on. They are strict because their level of responsibility and professionalism is best to non. I'll recommend them time and time again. They are definitely a model to follow. Maria, the manager at the location, will take care of all your storage questions and needs. Thank you for all your help.</text>< pics>

Cindy was very helpful and helped me get my storage needs met. And very professional. With her hard work she got my business. She's very sweet and nice. Made me feel welcomed right as I got through the door. If i could I would give her 10000x stars instead of just five. I recommend Cindy. She's great!</text>

<review>It's too hot going to the second floor of this storage. In the elevator it's so much cooler and fresh walk out boom. I just don't understand it. So does the stuff in the second floor can get ruined because of the heat. Ridiculous. Still paying 200 dollors a month and stuff when you touch you can feel heat. They get you with the 1 dollor first payment.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>This is Jennifer Keller using my sister's google+ account because I don't have one. I have been a customer for over 5 years & I have had 3 different units. I was referred to this location by a long time customer. The place is always neat, clean, well lit & feels safe.
I almost always deal with Ron & he is by far one of the most excellent customer service representatives I have come across. The thought of "going to storage" is not always pleasant, but Ron is always there to make it easier. He is approachable, professional, & clearly enjoys his job. It's a pleasure doing business with this company because of employees like Ron. Thanks for all you hard work!</review><Rating>5</Rating><response>None</response><pics>None< /pics>< gmapID>

Nice, clean place with exceptional customer service! Maria helped us and she couldn't be any nicer. Since this was the first time I had ever rented a storage unit I had tons of questions. Maria took the time to help answer all my questions and put my mind at ease. I highly recommend this place!<//text>

<review>Checked in At the end of March, and we met Ron there to get the job done.  Ron is a very nice and respectful older gentleman he’s very straightforward and tells you what you need to know as fast as you need to know it. He handles himself well and also i can tell he’s a very hard-working man. I moved at the beginning of April and lost my keys Ron was able to help me get back in my storage  following the proper protocols that the public storage issues  and get my stuff out and check out in time !  I appreciate all of Ron’s hard work I’ve been to many public storages throughout the last year and I could say this is by far the best customer service I have had. He remembers his customer faces and he does his job as he should never had a problem and I highly recommend the storage facility .</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Had a great move in experience today.  Ron, the manager, is fantastic.  I got an on-line quote for the size room that I needed and made a reservation.  When I arrived, it turned out that the room was still filled with someone's abandoned things.  Ron handled this situation beautifully.  I could not fit into a smaller room so, for the same price, Ron found another storage room for me that's a bit bigger.  I had movers waiting to help me unload and everything went smoothly and quickly.  Ron is a great representative for Public Storage and I thank him for so gracefully handling what could have been an unpleasant situation and keeping my business.</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Public Storage was running a $1 for the first month promotion. I called the hotline and they booked me a 5x10 for that price. They asked when I would be coming in, and I said the next day. So my unit was on hold till then. They also told me that the Public Storage Facility would be calling me as well, but that everything was set.

I ended up having to make a bunch of phone calls to organize moving agendas and I missed the call from the public storage people. But I called them back and asked if I could come get my unit today instead. They said that was fine.

Drove all the way there and it turned out they gave my unit to someone else. I was PISSED. I demanded that they give me the original price promised to me and not make me pay for their half off special. They made a phone call to their manager and got it sorted out. Gave me the special I was promised, and were really nice about it. So even though there was a slight mix up, they delivered in the end and I got my unit!</Review>

I'm writing this review for my teacher Lori Said. She doesn't have a gmail. But, her words. In her opinion. Public Storage is an amazing place to go to for your storage purposes. The employees are EXTREMELY friendly and VERY helpful. The customer service is AMAZING. She has been going to this storage facility for about a year. And, will continue to do so. She highly recommends that those who are searching for a facility that will safely storage their belongings, to go to Public Storage facility. Ron & Jessica have been nothing but cordial and professional at all times. They are more then happy to help or assist clients and give them the best service possible.</Review>

<Review>I have had a storage unit at this location since 2010. I am so happy! This is a great building and the managers are always friendly. Ron and Jessica are A+!

Affordable prices and there is always someone in the office to provide me with a key to a hand cart. I will keep my business here unless I move out of LA or just need a bigger unit and they don't have the vacancy!

Love my overall experience :)< /Review>< Pics>

I was looking for a storage unit and was referred to this location in Panorama City.  I met with Ron and he was so friendly, filled with so much positive energy and he just made me feel so comfortable.  They offered a great deal on the unit I was renting.  I definitely think there should b more people helping out with such great customer service skills like Ron's.</review>

I had a fantastic experience, someone was always there to let me borrow a cart when I needed it and sometimes Ron would even bring one to me if they were out when I needed one and I was still unloading when another one was returned.

My unit was in the garage on the main floor and that made it incredible especially during the summer when it was over 100, I'm from Phoenix so 100 isn't much to myself, but at least I didn't have the sun beating down on me :D

I'm sure some people think that Ron is rough around the edges, he reminded me of my dad so I was able to joke and talk to him like I do to my pops, he always cracked me up.

Just don't show up 5 minutes before they close and you'll always be on his good side :D......not that I know from experience.....< /review>

Ruby and Alejandra are sweethearts. They have very good customer service  . They make sure to go out of their way to make things easier on me. This facility is very clean and having these girls here is a blessing.  They are very down to earth and very friendly.< /Review>

Ruby thanks for helping my day go with ease. I didnt have time to look around for storage she assured me she can find one for me. I had almost forgot what the meaning of true customer service satisfaction really means. This young lady here is a Diamond waiting to be discovered.  I wish I would of rented here.< /Review>

<review>They will raise your rent 20% every year, so be prepared for that.  They will also tell you that they will pro-rate your rent if you move out before the end of the month, but this is a lie.  I notified in advance and moved out on the 6th under this assumption then they refused to pro-rate the month, which screwed me out of over $300.  The said it is corporate policy.  Also, don't believe all the 5 start reviews.  They ask you to review on move-in, before you realize they are going to lie to you and get every extra penny out of you they can under the guise of 'corporate policy'<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Gmap_id>

<review>I've seen this facility change management a couple times hands down Maria has been one of the best. Every time I come in she has a smile on her face & answers all my questions. I've seen her interact with other customers and she is the same way with them. Would highly recommend this storage place</review></record></dataset><record>

Last May I shop around and found that the Panorama City Public Storage was the perfect location for me. I went to find out information and met with Ron, he wa very helpful since day one, he not only gave me a great deal for my storage room, but helped me to get the right boxes, paper, etc, needed to pack my goodies. All the time Ron and Jessica had been very informative with all my questions and their personality is amazing they are cordial and professional at all times by phone and in person. Is nice to deal with people that love what they do it and Ron is certainly happy to assist clients and give them the best service. Blessings.

My parents had many belongings and file cabinets that needed to be stored after they passed.  We'd reserved this facility due to the close to freeway location and the air conditioning.  Ron Holt was extremely helpful and friendly when we first checked in.  Every time we go there, he has a cheerful disposition that makes the sometimes emotional and cumbersome task go smoothly.  I highly recommend this storage facility and Ron Holt as an awesome, excellent person to help anyone through the process of putting things in storage.<//Review>

<response>None<//response><Text>If I could I would give no stars this facility is so dirty the parking lot is not being clean at all. Me and my friend were waiting on the big girl  property manager and so-called Maria she is the worst she's stereotypes people just because they don't have money she is going to deny any promotion to them and upon completing the rental she and forced  us to have insurance which is illegal for her to do she said I am not able to rent any storage at Public Storage if I decline her insurance. This is ridiculous I already have insurance which would mean I would have double the insurance that I do not need she also told me that I am unable to rent due to the fact that I am not buying her lock. I do not need to buy public storage lock they overprice when I can get the same brand somewhere else. This is very ridiculous she is very rude me and my friend fell so uncomfortable that we were not able to rent due to her incompetence so now we are struggling to go to another storage facility after we wasted two hours of our life in this messed-up filthy facility. She is always on her phone and she ignores the fact that we need a storage. She then said we can get a deal if we buy at least one box which sounds very like a scam to me. So I decided to take my stuff and store somewhere else because of the fact that she humiliated me and thought that I had no money to get no lock and no insurance. We waited for about 45 minutes for her to come from wherever she came from she then said she was in her lunch isn't a lunch 30 minutes not 45 minutes anyways I do not recommend this place whatsoever it is so dirty so disgusting horrible driveway and horrible customer service from Maria I am so disgusted with her as we were walking out she tried to put her charm on another fella to give her a review she even grabbed his phone but that is not my business I am just letting you guys know beware do not get the insurance do not get the lock as it is not required. I have many friends that use public storage and I will let them know of my experience and if they went through something like this best believe we are leaving our reviews in this property mainly due to the fact that she care more about the guys review than our personal storage needs. Asking her for her managers number she simply replied she is the property manager and if I wanted to get higher than her will that would be impossible because of the fact that she runs the whole property. Maybe if she didn't take 45 minutes and her lunch she would have gained great customer. You should stop eating amd getting bigger in front of customers and take care of business that's why you were getting paid for. PROPERTY MANAGER MARIA IS HORRIBLE.< /Text>< GmapID>

as far as this public storage place would go I would say they are fine they have very good ample space The parking structure is okay The people that work there are very nice so that's definitely good The price is here are pretty decent as well I don't know too much about if that discounts and stuff like that but it's worth a shot you know< /Review>

I have storage here and it is upstairs because it is way cheaper but it sucks that the elevator is always broken. I have some heavy things because I store catering equipment such as insulated cambro food carriers. If you're upstairs bring a dolly or some help, if not then you're good because the floor level units are drive up. The place is kinda old but they keep it up by painting the stairs and walls/doors.< /Text>

Worst Public Storage location in the Valley, maybe even all of LA? My mother stores here and since move-in day, everything's been a problem. Even a few friends stored here too and they hated it. Break ins that they try to cover up and everything! The workers in the office are nice, the only reason I'm giving Two Stars. They might not have much control of what happens but the one person who does is their district manager Felipe Gomez. Doesn't know what he's doing! Leave a message after message for this guy and I doubt he'll even get back. I have friends who already left this place because of all the problems! Seems like the company can't get good District Managers to manage this place because the last manager of this place, she was an airhead too!!

Also, so many weird and suspicious people store here, no wonder they get break ins! Felipe needs to get his s*** together or this place is going to continue to lose its customers!

No wonder the prices here are so low...watch out people...invest in an other location or company...<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I was helping an out of town friend close out a storage unit.  It was somewhat difficult and a lot of paperwork had to be handled between Ron and my friend in Washington state.  It was done in a very professional and friendly way.  When I got to the unit to empty it there was some more confusion with the people coming in to take the stuff away.  It was an outside company and my friend decided in the middle of it not to use them because she thought they were to expensive.  She spoke with Ron on the phone and they agreed on an alternative plan.  Ron was so nice is explaining her options to her and ended up the experience is a very positive way.  I would recommend the Public Store facility on Roscoe in Panorama City to anyone that needed to rent a storage unit mainly because of the friendly, helpful attitude of Ron.  Thank him for me.

<review>This place is a joke like seriously last month my moms unit got broken into.... insurance will not pay for your stuff. Do NoT BUY it they make u believe u actually need it to rent well YOU DONT..  This so called boss of Mia is a joke she protects the staff even when they do wrong. Its so obvious that she has relations with the gay girl there that always has an attitude, leaves the store for hours and after I call corporate they say they will look into it. I believe if u get hired u should work and not leave for hours pretending they go to the bank and meeting all the time what a joke!!!  I cant believe this lazy lady is. Still employed!!!! Advice to Mia dont make your employees your friends it will back fire. With that being said. What a dissapointment. public storage to hire an staff that does not care like the fool of manager she is.<//review>< pics>

Mr Adobada Tacos, became our first option over the neighbors tacos down the street, This place is simply awesome and tacos are bomb, they have different food choices, it’s located inside a parking lot that has multiple food trucks, they’re clean, everyone is wearing masks and tables are clean, very easy to order and fast serving. It doesn’t gets really packed and I always find parking. I will definitely come back.</review>

<review>The Adobado taco 🌮 is the best taco I have had in california.  I usually love chorizo and they have a good one of those too but the Adobado here is amazing.  Simple and clean; not too much sauce and just the right amount of fresh vegetables and tender hot Adobado.  Hats off to the crew there this afternoon.  Middle of a rain storm and they were a pleasure to deal with and had a tent setup while you social distanced waiting for take out.  Please like this review if you find helpful.< /review>< pictures>

I waited in a very long line for adobada and birria, only to find out that no beef products were available (no signs or anything posted, so I could make alternate plans ahead of time).  I still wanted to try the adobada, but was unapologetically told it would be a 35 minute wait!  There are plent of good spots for adobada in SD (i.e. Tacos El Gordo) so I doubt I'll be back.<//review>

The best in Cuban food. Claims to have the best Cuban, but it is more of in the top 5 best. The seafood, however, is the greatest!! I highly recommend the codfish balls. If you're in Miami, you have to go to Versailles.</review>

It was a little dressier than I expected so felt a bit underdressed. The staff welcomed us and everything about the experience was wonderful. The garlic rolls came fresh out of the oven and are baguette style with a delicious garlic and oil blend. My husband had the chicken parmesan and said it was better than our favorite place in NY. I had the spaghetti bolognese which was absolutely perfect. The house Chianti was a treat. We will be back next time we are in the neighborhood.</review>

I finally found a good one in Versallies. The restaurant can get quiet busy and usually is less of a wait or no wait during weekday lunch. The menu is large and made for some tough decsions. I decided on tbe oxtails and it did not disappoint. It was rich in taste and tender. Loved it. The Cuban was great. Pressed just right and all the flavors melded perfect. The best thing I tasted that day was the Roast Pork on the sampler plate. It was moist and delicious. Cooked perfectly. Finish off with Cafe Con Leche. Its nice and strong. Lastly a tip. There is 4 parking lots. Just keep your eyes out for them. Street parking is available as well.< /text><user_id>108011872733642036718<//user_id></record>

Carne asada, flavorful. Tripa, flavorful. Lengua, little too well done for my taste but flavorful. Omg the cabeza tacos are delicious! ...and finally, the al pastor tacos' adobada marinade is very good! When I bit into the adobada tacos my pupils dilated lol I eat tacos in TJ and this my friends is as good as they come... Don't believe the hype down the block .. those kids are played out. Overrated. Mr. Adobada is legit 100% (IG @ imjoshualemons)<//text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) These are the best adobada tacos that I have ever tasted in my taquera life - we were looking for adobada tacos in Chula Vista because the usual ones were closed for safety in the face of the health emergency - by chance we devised this Lunchbox with the pure corner of the eye and said Well, whatever God wants and boom! We were amazed by the exquisite flavor of the marinated meat and the cleanliness and freshness of the marinated
I just have to super recommend Mr Adobada and come back as soon as possible to savor the best adobada tacos -
In Zerio! From Tijuana and Chula Vista together

Estos son los mejores tacos de adobada que eh probado jamás en mi vida taquera - buscábamos tacos de adobada en Chula Vista por que los de costumbre estaban cerrados por seguridad ante la emergencia sanitaria - por casualidad devisamos esta Lonchera con la pura esquinita del ojo y dijimos pues que sea lo que Dios quiera y boom!! que nos dejo sorprendidos el exquisito sabor de la carne adobada y la limpieza y frescura de la adobada
No tengo más que súper recomendar a Mr Adobada y regresar en cuanto sea posible para saborear los mejores tacos de adobada -

<date>1626908643247< /date><Rating>2<//Rating><review>I had a poor experience with glasses I purchased. Very high priced crystal brand glasses are poorly made cheap plastic. I spent over 200$ on frames that bent 2 months into having them,  I went in for them to be adjusted and fixed, the tech adjusted them only to tell me they were bent and I would need a whole new frame, no warranty, didnt offer me a new pair, or a discount on a new pair. Literally just spent 200$, on the cheapest pair they had and now have to spend more money, the doctor is good, service is good, but extremely over priced and I wont be going back.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>BEWARE Advice everyone that has IEHP stay away from this place!first of all  my son is fully covered by IEHP including coverage for glasses. On our first appointment after seeing their dr she obviously prescribed him glasses when I went to choose the glasses I ask the staff to show me the ones covers by IEHP to this she answer sadly we don’t have a contract with them for glasses #1 lie, I called IEHP and they told me they should’ve shown me some glasses covered by them. My cheapest option that they showed me where 3 pairs for $145 not free ok so my son ended up choosing some other ones for $243 after I paid for these they handed me my receipt and a form that I needed to sign saying I had chosen eye glasses not covered by medical! RED FLAG they are covering themselves with this paper so that no one is able to sue. Ok so today I went to pick up my son’s glasses and I ask for a case the girl was reaching for a hard case when the liar that told me they weren’t covered by IEHP told her not to, to just give me a slip bag that those don’t come with a hard case. Very very upsetting specially when I paid more for my kids glasses than my husband did for his. Please do not go there I will not be going back and also don’t fall for it your insurance might cover and they are just lying. I’ve never been treated this bad!< /Review>< gmap_id>

<text>I typically go to Lens Crafters, but I wanted to give this place a chance, because of the reviews. Didn't care to much for the staffs attitude, I was getting anxious with the doctor. The energy was very off. I also felt like I was just dirt, but in reality if you earn my respect and you're kind to me and patient, I don't mind spending a generous amount. Needless to say this was my first time seeing an optometrist in California since I moved out of State. I apologize for being late.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c3367ef5105ce9:0x55563398d34827b7<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Well the doctor their had actually told us that it would take two weeks for my daughters glasses to get their with prescription and all the add on’s but somehow they lost the glasses and hadn’t called me to notify my till two weeks after the fact. On top of my glasses being lost under their supervision I had to buy an entirely new glasses which weren’t cheap if I may add As well as the doctor when getting my daughters and my own, eye exam the doctor repetitively insisted that “cheap glasses can get broken easily in manufacturing” she had said it so many times that it actually felt insulting as if she was judging based on I don’t even know what, that she thought I didn’t get good branded glasses and each time she had mentioned it I responded by saying that trust me I know I have a good brand. After my glasses getting lost and the disrespect from the main doctor their I won’t be going back as well as they said they couldn’t do anything to refund us other then what our insurance would give us. I will not be returning anytime soon.</review>< pictures>

I’ve been seeing this optometrist for about 5 years now, and I can only say good things about the doctor and her staff. I have absolutely no complaints. They recently moved to a bigger office closer to my home, and it’s great. I recommend anyone in need of an eye doctor to go see her. She also specializes in children’s eyes as well.</review>

This Place was amazing!! My experience here even choosing the wrong glasses and them fixing it for me was the best experience! All the staff was very helpful and friendly and worth every dime I spent. I recommend this place for glasses and sunglasses! Top notch!< /text>

Such friendly, well-informed staff, clean space and a really wonderful doctor. The quality of the products they carry is fantastic, I’ve never had an easier time making my frame selections. They have a really nice text reminder for appointments. I loved my experience!!!< /Review>

<review>Dr. Adhikari is the absolute best optometrist my husband or myself has ever been too. She is very thorough and she shares details and information about each step through the exam (which keeps nervous little ones nice and calm). The entire staff is welcoming and attentive, we feel well taken care of there. We are so happy to have found Crystal Vision Optometry!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Absolutely love this place!  I thought I’d be wearing glasses for the rest of my life. Crystal vision has help me care for my eyes so I could get lasik. Their lasik recommendation was amazing. My after care with Crystal Vision has been so great and easy.  Everyone is kind and helpful. The new location is gorgeous and easy to get too. They use technology to help with appointments and reminders and for a busy gal on the go I couldn’t ask for anything more.<//text>

Very nice Office thought that I would try a new doctor seeing as though I have been going to target for many years. i stumbled upon this new location next to my Tailor.I must say I will not be returning to this office nor will I’ll give them my business. every other conversation from the office manager to the doctor was an attempt to get more money out of my pocket and not willing to offer any type of discount As I was Was getting 2 prescriptions done.Not very personable at least to me. kind of felt prejudged also she thought my insurance coverage was Medi-Cal.last time I checked MES is pretty good insurance.<//Text>

I loved my experience , it was my first time and everyone was so kind. Marissa, the receptionist, was very welcoming and the Doctor herself was very professional and cared to listen to me without rushing me out the door like many Doctors I have been to . I will be taking my son there soon and would recommend to the rest of my family.< /review>

Then the second, after two days, I went to get contact lenses. In both visits I was pleased and satisfied. Especially when I did my contact lenses Dr. Adhikari was very informative and explained everything clearly, keeping In mind that it was my first time wearing contact lenses. First she told me that she is going to put the contacts herself, just to show me how it works. After that, her assistant Sandra helped me throughout the procedure of putting on the contacts and take them off. They were so patient and professional. I was very uncertain of wearing contacts and how complicated it is to put them on and off. But they made it so easy and simple. To be honest the whole staff was very professional and helpful. I recommend this place to anyone especially who wants to get contact lenses. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.< /Review>< Pics>

Also, she was telling me i only had ten more minutes for my training on contacts when she knew i was having a hard time after i just spent 125 to be rushed and told “your doing it wrong.” Jordan helping me with the contact fitting was extremely patient and kind as well as my doctor.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1563581983607, 'text': "Maria, I am sorry for the delayed response and I apologize for the situation during your contact lens training.

I was displeased with my encounter with this office as a whole.

Many minor things that were an extreme  nuance when undergoing something as simple as an eye exam.

Since I was unhappy with the exam, I chose a new office to receive glasses. Upon 3 different attempts to fit my glasses, I continued to have visual problems. At this point the new office thought the prescription was the issue, and recommended having another exam performed.

I called my insurance company to state I was unhappy with my original exam and they authorized a second opinion.

Upon new examination, the prescription was changed and corrected.

I would not recommend this office.

However, I will state the offfice staff was genuine in my many trips to the office.

<Review>My son started going here after my pediatrician said he might be farsighted at 2 1/2. It’s incredibly difficult to diagnose a patient who is shy and doesn’t want to have an eye exam, let alone able to communicate on demand. Well, Dr. Leena Adhikari did an excellent job because at our pediatric follow-up (where they use a vision camera), they said that his vision was 20/20 with his glasses. That is amazing! Dr. Adhikari is patient, and gives you her undivided attention during your visit. I’ve had an exam myself as I hadn’t had an eye exam in 15 years, she is super friendly and personable. Love this place!</Review>< Pics>

<Text>I am so disappointed. I chose my frames for glasses and told me that they were sent out and would arrive in a few weeks. I called them every week for the past 3 months to know that the glasses were "lost" instead of simply apologizing the staff told me that they it was because he handles 14-15 patients everyday and doesn't have time to go back and check every patients frame even though i called every week! unprofessional and rude, they need to be more organized and actually follow up with their patients</Text><name>Suhani Randev</name>< userid>

My first appt went great. 2nd not so much. Had an appt at 430. Called and told them I would be a little late due to an overwhelming amount of traffic. Was told that would be fine. Got a call less than 30 seconds later saying they wouldn't see patients after 440 so if I was after they wouldn't see me. Will look for another office that cares about their patients.< /text>

I took my son to get checked his vision was fine was prescribed the LOWEST prescription. My son has IEHP so I didnt want to pay much for his glasses because first of all he didn’t really need them. I asked the employee if the glasses he picked were covered by IEHP and I was told YES!! But that the lens where not so i had to pay out pocket $25 for the Right and Left Totaling $50 which I Paid. Then I was asked by a family friend why I had paid If iehp covers glasses for kids! which I didnt know at first. I was told those glasses were covered by the employee she even went to ask because she wasn’t sure and they told her yes the glasses were covered but that I had to pay $50 for lens because supposedly IEHP doesnt cover for the prescription lens! I was LIED too!! Now they are saying we choose glasses that are more than what IEHP covers!! That was all a lie!! I filed a grievance and now im taking it to dhc. All they want is money even If you dont need them they will prescribe them they take advantage especially kids they dont know so parents beware make sure your kids really really need them my son doesnt even wear them because he sees no diference with them or without them! They are Money hungry. Wont be coming back< /Text>< Pics>

Pushes ortho k regardless of your financial status and when it didn’t work, I received no refund, wasn’t even offered. Couldn’t even get glasses only received their disposable contacts. I stressed that we have 5 kids and this was going to be a lot of money but she continually told me that it works and I have nothing to worry about. Looking back on it now, I should’ve realized that NO one in the office has had this Ortho K, they all still wear glasses or contacts, but push this on everyone even suggesting to get it for my son that is 13. When I went for a check up to see how it was working, every patient to come out she was getting to sign up for Ortho K!! If it’s so great, WHY doesn’t your staff or you have it?? Now... I have more debt to pay off and more anxiety and frustration with the lack of compassion for her clients. All we are, are dollar signs! Be cautious please.... it’s not worth it<//Text>< Time>

We had a great time on our kayak cave tour. The sea was a bit rough when we went out, but it was still a good experience. We managed to go through some caves, and see marine wildlife very up close! The guides also take pictures of you the whole trip, and provide the pictures to you at the end of the experience. It can be tiring to kayak ~3 hours, but there's a break half-way through the tour and water/snacks are provided, which was great. We would recommend this company!</Text>

These guys do a great job. They are patient, funny and fun. Khristian and Heather were our guides and were fantastic! It isn't a waste of time if you want a fun, kayak/cave adventure. Great value!

My paddle did have a slight issue, there was no smiley face to remind me which side was up and it almost ruined my day. :)< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>My husband arranged the kayak cave tour and it was awesome! All paperwork was done ahead online. Our guide met us at the shop where there was a clean restroom and curtained change areas. Andrew greeted us and had all our gear ready to go. They provided booties, Farmer John wetsuits, long sleeve rash guards, wind proof splash guards and PFDs. We took a short walk to the beach while Andrew got to know us a little and where our kayaks were already waiting. Andrew gave us a thorough briefing as to what to expect and how to handle the ocean swells and waves and how to re-enter our kayaks safely should we end up in the water. He then got us all launched through the surf. Once on our way, we would periodically re-group and Andrew would tell us what the next challenge would be (tunnel, cave)and advise how to best navigate it. He also gave us info about the many pelicans, seals, otters, oyster catchers and commorants that we passed by on the rocks.

Yes, it was challenging for flat water kayakers as ourselves, as the seas got quite bumpy and we got wet and cold, but Pat and I were both comfortable with Andrew’s judgement, safety instincts and water skills.

After a decent paddle back to our exit point, we were greeted by Andrew’s colleagues who assisted us in landing safely through the surf and rocks. After a short drive back to the shop, we were changed, dry and off to lunch and wine tasting! The great surprise was that the many great photos that Andrew had taken along the adventure were uploaded and sent to us as soon as we were back at the shop!

Thanks, Andrew and the crew at Central Coast Kayak for a beautiful paddle! We definately will be returning!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We rented kayaks from here and couldn't have enjoyed the experience more.  The owner (I tried to remember your name...sorry) was friendly and helpful.  The crew at the beach were also great.  It was one guys first day and he had worn long pants...very funny guy and really friendly.  He got smashed by a wave bringing in my wife.  He was soaked and she was as dry as could be.  Nice work man.  Thanks!!<//Text>< pictures>

Friendly staff, affordable. Equipment is a bit old & frayed. Gorgeous location. Lots of birds & marine life perched on rocks (some with tunnels you can paddle through) along a fairly sheltered coastline.</review>

We went on the ocean cave Adventure. It was phenomenal. L Brent and Libby were terrific guides, we had so much fun learned a lot about the area and just had a blast. We went through a lot of caves, when the Whitecaps started up as the tide came in if they can a lot of fun we all made it back safely, everybody had a great time. Very highly recommended<//Review>

Amazing experience with the team at Central Coast Kayaks. We did the cave tours... this was my first time in a kayak and I was very nervous but the team helped me to relax and I was able to do most the activities. Very cool experience and I would highly recommend to anyone visiting the area.<//text>

My friend and I did the cave tour - it was amazing!  Nick was our guide, very knowledgeable, patient, and a great teacher.  The staff at the store were amazingly helpful and pretty stinking funny too!  Would definitely recommend, and would love to go back with my family - thanks for a great adventure!< /Review>

Very nice experience. The trainer was very knowledgable about the water conditions and gave very good instructions before the ride to get us prepared. There are some really scenic areas along the way. On a calm day it would be a good idea to take a camera on the kayak if you have previous experience kayaking<//review>

Although I have done a lot of saltwater fishing, I'd never been kayak fishing...until today.  Set up the trip with Kelsie (extremely professional); Tom (the owner) spent a lot of time telling me about how to fish the area and answered every question I had.  The entire staff was great and I highly recommend them.  Can't wait to fish there again.< /Review>

Twice we were told they’d rent kayaks at a certain time and twice we were turned away before. Drove an hour north at arrived at 3:30p after being told the last rentals go out at 4pm. Incredibly disappointing. Will not try again.< /text>

I went to CCK for the installation of a Yakima roof rack. When the owner John found out I didn't buy it through them he was very fussy and crusty. When he found out how much I paid for it he was quite as his was priced horribly higher. He spent an hour with his technician trying to put my rack on and was unable to do it. Said the Q7 clips were wrong. He recommended some straps and a foam pack so I purchased it from it. Come to find out....the Yakima racks he told me were wrong WERE CORRECT. We had the Yakima distributor call John and tell him how and he wanted nothing to do with it as he sold me the other system. Instead he just HUNG UP on the distributor! I then took my Yakima racks to another dealer and they put them on no problem. While I was there having John at Central Coast Kayaks "try" to install my racks I heard a customer walk in irritated saying that the racks were sold "used" and I heard the owner John saying "oh no they are not used". Either way horrible customer service, pricing and knowledge.< /review>< pics>

< Review>
Good experience overall, but I wish the crew members had exercised better judgement when it came to kayaking near the rocks.  One of the guides went into a cave and could not get out bc of how powerful the waves were at the time.  Instead of conceding that it was too dangerous for inexperienced kayakers, the guide ushered in my boyfriend who subsequently tipped over and got pummeled against the rocks by the waves.  He has a fractured ankle and elbow bc of their carelessness.  My advice for future kayakers: If it looks unsafe it probably is.</Review>

However I was disappointed in the lack of personal interest in the server helping us.  I'm sure it may have been an off day for that person but with times being the way they are and with less traffic flow it would be nice to have someone wanting to be there serving us.

Have been coming to this Pho place since I was in high school. Throughout the yrs my feelings about it have changed on multiple occasions but these past few times this place has been delicious! It has never disappointed by any means, but there were sometimes where broth was less or more flavorful. It's been a lot more consistent lately- broth lately is very delicious and packed w flavor! The staff is very nice, accommodating and swift! I appreciate that about any business and will def keep coming here! Love<//text>

If I could give zero stars I would. My father and I came here for lunch after his radiation treatment, he was craving pho so we picked this place because it was close to home. When we got there the place was not packed at all, there were max 5 tables occupied, we sat down and immediately our order was taken, which not bad in my opinion but that's as good as it got. We then were reseated for an unknown reason by the waiter and waited over 30 minutes for our food that never arrived. During this time three more tables were filled and their food brought to them within 10 minutes. We asked the waiter when our food would get to us and his response was you ordered already? We ended up walking out because of the poor service. I understand if orders get forgotten or delayed but to just flat out ignore your customers sitting in the middle of everyone and not ask how they are or if they had ordered yet for over 30 minutes is just wrong and speaks a lot about the care they put into their business. What else do they ignore or forget about I wonder? We will not be coming here again, nor recommend this place to anyone. In fact if you are looking for somewhere to eat I recommend the Mandarin restaurant right next door, 5+ stars for them ;)</Review>

<review>One of the best places down south to get your fill of delicious pho. My go-to is the spring rolls, #13, and the steak, shrimp, and broken rice combo! You don't have to drive too far from the freeway, which is a nice bonus!< /review></record>

<Gmap_id>0x80d94e4e24c6514d:0x8fc8a76b127b5abd</Gmap_id><review>By far the worst "pho" I've ever had. The broth was tasteless, the noodles weren't pho noodles, vegetables overcooked.  Came with no pho fixings.  It tasted like it had been reheated.

To make matters worse, the staff was rude. We walked in at 8:30 pm (they close at 9) and the server practically rolled his eyes when we asked to place an order takeout because they were "closed".

Terrible service and super horrible taste-wise. Save your money, go somewhere else.< /review>< user>

Without a doubt, the worst service I’ve ever gotten at a restaurant. We stood in the cramped doorway waiting to be greeted as multiple servers made eye contact and just kept walking by. Then after we were finally seated, our terrible waitress was unbelievably rude to my girlfriend— like to the point where we just stopped trying to understand what her problem was. She also didn’t bother to write our order down and thus forgot to give me my drink. She never came back after taking our order, not even once, so I couldn’t remind her about my missing drink either. Then when I got the check later from a different server they’d charged me for the drink. When I asked this other server for the drink to be taken off the check, our server insisted that we’d received it and refused to take it off the bill. I had to pay for it. The food was also super basic and not even worth a visit. What a ridiculous, negative experience.</review>

A funny thing. I live in Alexandria, VA and there's plenty of places for me to get Pho..but, sadly, never had. I have to come to San Diego to have my 1st Pho experience. So glad I did. This place was definitely worth my wait..food was phenomenal. Kind n courteous staff, answered all my questions n explained everything n detail in order I'd have a great experience. Definitely have them saved as a favorite.</Review>

Wow. Just wow. A COMPLETE turn around. The very first time about 2 years ago I came here for take out and was less than impressed with the service that I actually left before ordering. About 4 months later I attempted to eat here and was pleased. The food was quite yummy. The service and atmosphere was lacking. But we kept coming bc it was still yummy and I didn't want to travel far. Tonight we came back bc I saw that it looked different from the outside and wanted to check it out. We were there last about 4 months ago. When we came in tonight we were blown away. The atmosphere is fabulous. The new design is so fun, modern and inviting. The service was superb and I swear the food was better than before. Will be back again soon.</Review>

Already looking forward to the next trip.< /Text>< Rate>

<Review>First of all over overpriced. Service is very slow. Waited 30 minutes for a takeout order and I have been to many a Vietnamese restaurants and never have ever had to wait that long even with an extraordinary amount of people. I Ordered spring rolls and they forgot and I had to wait again. The quality of is okay. I live in a Vietnamese community and this is not Vietnamese quality. Probably because it's in a in area where there are no Vietnamese population so the recipes are tailored towards the demographics of the restaurant.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdb5qIdD_CdGW9e-PLqrKY9iexYt2Utom5NUFt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80d94e4e24c6514d:0x8fc8a76b127b5abd< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

It was okay but not great, I would go somewhere else for pho. The staff was nice though. Also, the Thai tea comes with whipped cream so be aware!

The location was nothing special, the food was on the bland side and the prices were high for the quality you received. The saving grace was the portion sizes were massive, so after adding a bunch of sauces to get some flavor, it held our appetites for a while after. We came, we ate and it was just an "okay" experience. Probably wouldn't return.<//Text>

Great place for some Pho! Went in today and it was packed not an empty spot but service was top notch and food was delicious as usual ! The gentleman we had a server was very personable and made the lunch super enjoyable for my wife and I. Repeat customers for sure and highly recommend!<//review>

Their food has good taste.  Portion wise, it's a hit or miss with the noodles and the beef (sometime you get more sometime you get less). The servers have a language barrier, make sure to ask them to repeat your order.
If you are short on time, you can always pay your check at the cashier, instead of waiting for your server to come back. Clean bathroom too.</Text>

We have enjoyed the fabulous food and delightful service here for more than 8 years.  Love the chicken pho. Love the grilled shrimp and beef. Love the people. When we need a boost we go to Pho Hiep and take our best friends. Highly recommend.<//text>

I rarely put reviews on places i have been to but this one needs to get renovated or atleast get a quality check... ate here about 3x and since the first time it was a bad customer service but i gave them 2nd and third chance but this is the last time i am eating in this place, plates are not clean and while i am eating there are flies and my water has a flies and the server didn’t even ask if everything is okay and is has a very disrespectful attitude... if i can complain somewhere for this place to get close for some inspections i will do so....  for the safety of all the people eating here.
And also to learn some discipline and manner.</Text>< Pictures>

Terrible service.  First I'm waiting to be seated and some other family comes in and and the sever even after me telling her I was here first was about to seat them first. Then that same sever gives my food to the table next to me.  My son and I waiting to eat.  I noticed the two other groups come in after me and they were served first even when we placed our order first.  Finally get our food and the other tables are being asked how is the food and no one asks us. I'm sorry to say this but the family that came in after us and the other table that was given our food were Asian. I'm hoping that had nothing to do with the service that my son and I received.  I'm not sure that my business was welcomed.  Very upset that it was hard for me to enjoy my dinner.</review>

The service really sucks, it's kinda warm inside. If you catch them in a good mood it's fine but otherwise good luck. They stare at you the entire time and the short chubby lady that is always here doesn't give me my change half the time</review>

I'm a somewhat regular here because it's near my home, but after today I think I'll make that extra drive somewhere else. Food is ok but family owned business needs to stop hiring rude employees. I was served and never checked on to see if I needed anything else or if everything was ok, instead I recieved a mumbled comment when I did not tip for the non service they provided. Funny thing is the lady wasn't even my server and had the audacity to ask for a tip. Luckily for her I was in great spirits and smiled and said to have a great day.< /text>

While I was eating my soup, I found a long solid black hair weaved into a piece of meat that I was about to eat. It wasn't mine because I have black and blonde hair. The server did not apologize either. I recommend to check your food before eating it.< /Review>

Pho is pretty good, standard issue. Not too salty and not all cloudy like they used a bucket of msg. Real herb and meat flavored broth. Two things I would suggest. I love fatty brisket, but there's is super hard to chew. The fat isn't like fat at all, it's crunchy and hard. It's disappointing when you're expecting something totally different, so I wouldn't order that particular meat. Also, when you get to-go, which I do often, get an extra broth and boil it all at home because the broth they give you just isn't enough and of course it isn't going to be hot enough to soften the noodles by the time you get home!< /text>

This is a nice place. Clean and well kept. The food was decent and the price was very affordable, but rating it against the best Pho I've ever had is what has me listing it as a 3 star and not a 4.</review>

<text>Service: Service here is truly the only thing that bothers me here. Some of individuals right here appear to care about offering you and some do not. Good or negative service actually depends upon that you get. Food: I come below possibly when a week for either some uncommon beef pho\/seafood pho or the barbequed beef as well as shrimp with rice. I like their food a lot and also I really enjoy their Thai tea with boba (pointer for their boba: if you get a big sized beverage it'll can be found in a to go cup)Auto parking: car park can be a little jam-packed during lunch\/dinner hours. Total: one of my favored locations to get hold of some food to consume just do not expect five star service.</text>< pictures>

Ordered an appetizer, two entrees, and drinks to go with but the appetizer never came out, and they still tried to charge us for it. On top of that, the shrimp in my pho hadn't been cleaned properly, and had black streaks running all along the backside of them even though they were fully cooked. When we confronted the manager about it, she got an attitude with us and told us that we should have said something sooner despite us telling our waitress multiple times. Terrible service, they won't be seeing us again.</Text>

<Review>Well everything started off great. I was out with my boss and coworker having a business lunch when they brought our food to the table. Immediately I spotted not one but two long hairs intertwined with my noodles. I thought, "You know what, this kind of stuff happens" so I promptly removed the hairs and decided to continue with my lunch. When I was nearing the end of my meal, I felt something thin and hard and I had thought maybe it was the skin of the shrimp or something. When I pulled the unexpected object out of my mouth, to my astonishment, it was a finger nail! Now, I've had a band aid in my food before, so this isn't the worst thing to have happened to me. But who on earth clips their finger nails in the kitchen of a restaurant serving food?? I don't know, but the food was not worth me having to go through that. Terrible.<//Review>< GmapID>

Customer Service is horrible! The waitress had a bad attitude when we placed the order. She doesn't take the time to explain the menu but instead she rolls her eyes.<//review>

We felt rushed.  Neon lights said "Open" but service said "get out".  It was nearing closing time when we arrived, party of 5.  There are several tables inside to eat.  The restaurant is nicely decorated in asian decor to match the theme of the place.  However, it was difficult to get answers to our questions.  We asked in English and received blank stares.  The food is good, and I love to order take-out.</Text>

I usually frequent this place as my wife and I enjoy the food.  Tonight I was met with utter rudeness and price gauging.  I ordered a small chicken soup for supposedly $8.50, charged $11.50.  when I inquired... The response was prices went up very rudely, yet the menu stated one price and charged another.  Never coming again.  Just lost a customer for life.  Good luck with the 12 F...ING soup.</text>

First and last time here. I walked in asked to order to go the girl handed me a menu.Once I was ready I walked back to the counter and said i am ready to order ... her response "i am busy right now, wait" I should have left because it wasn't even busy. But I waited, i placed my order and she said it would take about 15 minutes. I noticed a few people waiting to be seated and no one was acknowledging them until one decided to ask to be seated. About 10-15 minutes  later I started noticing the 4 couples that were seated after I had placed my order were already getting their food. I walked over to the counter and spotted my food in a corner table a new waitress asked me if she could assist me I said yes I been waiting for my to go order and she asked for my name went to the kitchen then to the corner table and handed my food. I could not believe my food had been sitting there the whole time, I wonder how much longer I would had been there wait until they decide to call out my name.... I got home and my food was cold had to re heat ... never again!< /review>< pictures>

They didn't open until 9am, so we waited.  9:15 rolled around, they were still cleaning and totally ignored a repeat customer.   We are not begging for food, we were loyal customer driving from Eastlake.  If you can't acknowledge someone who consistently go there,  they probably won't care about the one who never been there.  No more going to this place ever.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

The Pho here was good. The Pho here was hot.
I imagine it's prepared in a big silver pot.
I got it with brisket, and rare strips of flank,
I poured in some fish oil and then my fingers stank.
I recommend it with hoisin, with basil and sprouts.
For the spicy connoisseur--Sriracha no doubt.
Remember to wash your hands when your meal here is through.
Because the odorous fish oil will leave your fingers as fresh as fish poo.< /Review>

The food being bad would have been ok if the servers were good but once we received our food they stood about ten feet away staring at us eat. Not only did they watch us but when I asked for more chili oil they told me  I didn't need it. We were so uncomfortable we left.

There are 2 large tables ready, yet after 8 minutes go by and countless waiters walk by us and one of us have to walk up to the manager and ask why we haven't been greated. The manager then makes up excuses that do not make sense. - extremely poor service, full excuses and a  clueless staff.< /Text>< pics>

They used to be 4 stars.  A decent pho joint near our home.  However they recently raised their prices.  A large bowl of pho should not cost nearly $11!  That's absurd.  Also they did something to their beef slices.  They tasted like they were cooked before being put in the hot broth and the beef was dry and falling apart.  There are far better pho places in downtown Chula Vista.  I won't be going here anymore.< /review>

Staff is good but they do get busy, usually during a raining day. Also good for hangovers...especially when you have it with a Tiger beer.
Its not expensive. Would definitely recommend this place.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Really BAD custumer service on this place! I would NOT recommend anyone to eat at this restaurant. First they tried to ignore us like you are never there. When we finally order, after 10 minutes they said they dont have the food order so I ask what is available on the menu cook so we did order again. They came back after few minutes saying the kitchen is already close that was 30 minute prior to closing @ 930 pm. What a waste of time! Very disappointed and will not eat on this restaurant again!</Review></record></dataset><record>

Terrible customer service!  I waited 10 min to be seated while a lot of seats were available. Finally I got a seat and the waiter show up after 10 min. He never served my diner after a 20 min wait.< /Text>

<text>Love, love, love this place. Very clean and authentic! The Pho is full of flavor, like when gramma cooks and adds that touch of love. Ive gone to MANY pho spots but this one is definitely one of my favorites. Super friendly staff and are always prompt in bringing your food. But please guys, stop being so stingy with the limes, all pho places do this, why? Hahaha<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>Got there, not really busy. It started good, Gave us a table in 2 min. Ordered spring rolls as apetizers, 3 phos and a dinner plate for my son. Received pho first, 15-20 mins after, we get dinner plate. Waiter apologized but still late. We had to ask for the spring rolls which came in shortly after dinner plate. Low quality tripe(really really hard) can't knock on waiter due to his age and lack of enthusiasm. I've been to many places and by far this takes the price for worst one. Slightly over priced. Flavor was ok. Felt like going to Taco Bell for authentic Mexican food. Kearny Mesa has a couple of great places for pho, I just tried to keep my business locally.< /Text>< Pics>

Owners scamming prices. e order plenty of food, they charged us $0.50 to $0.70 over than what is stated on the menu. I asked why, owner stated it is too expensive to reprint the menu and since it is stated in small print "prices are subject to change without notice", she said she can charge whatever she wants. Strange, I thought it is actually very defined market and statements such as this have a name "false advertisement> It is up to people to go there or not, but I think everyone should know before ordering.< /Text>

Spring rolls are healthy and light. The sauce accompanied with corn powder is perfect.
The amount of the dish is pretty! I will eat again!

<Text>Lovely park with a few shade areas. Would be great if they built a gazeebo over the swings and play structure for sunny and rainy days. Also added more benches and tables for small gatherings. Love this park been coming here for over 20 years. Now my child enjoys it as well<//Text>< pics>

It's quiet away from main street traffic noise. It has a playground for the kids. Enough area for dogs to run around. I enjoy practicing my martial arts there.<//review>

COVID had us outside. The woman who cut my son and nephew's hair did a wonderful job! She was quick, concise and gave us exactly what we asked for....a tapered fade for one and a comb over type with a hard part for the other.</review>

Amigos Barbershop is a family friendly shop. The barbers are all very skilled in their craft especially Maria, she's been doing an outstanding job on my hair for over 20 yrs. I love this place and I highly recommend this shop.</text>

<review>We went for the first time and my boyfriend really liked his hair cut. As soon as you walk in, it's easy to tell they do their best to keep the place clean. We were greeted the second we walked in which was very good for our first impression of them. I believe they only do hair cuts designed for men or any one looking for  barber shop hair cuts. As i waited, i noticed they paid attention to detail in their cuts which is also a plus. They made every customer feel comfortable and i definitely think we'll be going back.</review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) I really liked the service and the atmosphere, the prices are good depending on the haircut, they go from $ 10 for a normal cut or a little more if you want something more detailed or special including the beard, the hairdressers are very friendly and They serve in a good way, but most importantly, if they cut their hair very well and pay attention to every detail to leave the client satisfied with their cut and I liked mine, I recommend you friends barber shop

(Original)
Me gusto mucho el servicio y el ambiente,  los precios son buenos dependiendo del corte de cabello,  van desde $10 por un corte normal o un poco mas si es que se quiere algo mas detallado o especial incluyendo la barba,  los peluqueros son muy amables y atienden de buena manera, pero lo mas importante,  si cortan el cabello muy bien y se fijanen cada detalle para dejar al cliente satisfecho con su corte y a mi me gustó el mio,  les recomiendo amigos barber shop</review>

I'm used to Lola's in Santa Rosa they are much bigger. For the small size of the Healdsburg market they had a nice selection. I head to Lola's when I want to put together some authentic Mexican cuisine that tastes much better then anything you get outside of a Mexican market. They have every piece of every farm animal and every cut you could want and half a dozen butchers back there working furiously to do it,  they have different types of queso fresca ,sour creams  , a deli with insane flavorful black or frijole beans or pintos just everything.  marinades , wonderful sauces grilled jalapenos and onions all the little things that make a huge difference don't kid yourself real authentic Southwest and Mexican flavorful foods are made by hands with experience and Lola's has it... And all the desserts you can hope for.. it's Valentine's Day I'm going to have my girl in my pocket I make a killer masa for fresh tortillas oh yeah<//review>

And the. Guy from the. Kitchen is. A Mexican. Guy  he’s.  Rude too like the. Big guy I. The meat. Department. He always in the phone I was telling. Him can you. Help me. And. Ignores me.  The manager needs  to do. Something   About it. Cause they. Don’t. Respect nothing<//text>

<review>Mexican food is tasty, and Lola's delivers the goods. The staff are helpful, and Latinas are the hottest women on the planet so be sure to practice your Espanol before visiting. The salsa here is in-credible. Everything is fresh. The aisles are cramped but that's because they have to fit all that wonderful food for you to enjoy!</review>< Pics>

the service was poor, like pulling teeth, I asked for three different food options untill I found something they had. The food was mediocre at best. Unlikely, I'll be back. That sucks as the one I. santa rosa offers good food and quick service< /text>

Ok, but way too crammed. It looks and smells dirty, most of their produce looked old and wilted. Bought some cucumbers that looked fresh, but upon peeling, were soggy. A few months back, my dad bought a bag of corn husks for tamales, and when I opened it up, I found rat or mice droppings in between some of the husks. About a year ago, my bf bought octopus to make tostadas, but when we went to open up the bag it came in, it smelled way too fishy, well of course it did, it was bad! I myself will not be shopping here, but for convenience and close proximity to his work, my dad continues to shop here, unfortunately. I am not sure how people still shop here, honestly. Sorry for the bad review, I'm just being honest and noting what I observed.</Review>

<Review>God I love Lola's!  They have such good stuff in the meat case!!!  Get them marinated ribs... one pound per person.  Put them in the oven at 300 degrees for 3 hours and them feed them to your friends.  They will think you are a genius!  When they ask for the recipe, say, "Oh, it's an old family recipe and my Mom told me never to share it."  If your Mom is there though, you'd better fess up.

Lola's also has great chorizo.  Boil your beans, fry up some of that chorizo and toss into your beans... chop some onion and put in the beans too.  Feed it to your friends.  They will think you are a genius.  "Damn!  Where did you learn to cook such good chili beans?!"  Just say, "My girlfriend Lola... she helped me."<//Review>< GmapID>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>The food was the worst I had.  Quesadilla was cold. My 6 year daughter did not eat it.  My burrito super was dropping grease and stain my shirt and pants.  The beans had no salt. The carne asada had lots of hard tendons. Some other pieces were burn.  The red salsa tasted old and bad, about to go bad. The rice was hard.  I was so disappointed I called the place and asked to talk to the manager
I asked if they ever taste their own food and he did not gave me and answer.  He said he was not aware of the problem.  He said that he was sorry and hopefully next time my experience would be better.  I don't think Im coming back there.  The food was  expensive and really bad for me.<//review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) It is not true that they open at 6 am .. they have the door closed, and it is also not true that they close at 10, at 9:45 they stop you from attending, they no longer let people in and those inside are hurrying them or They say they have already closed the box and that they can no longer serve you.

No es verdad que abren a las 6 am.. tienen la puerta cerrada, y tampoco es verdad que cierran a las 10, a las 9:45 te dejan de atender, ya no dejan entrar gente y a los que están adentro los apuran o les dicen que ya cerraron caja y que ya no te pueden atender.</Text>

(Translated by Google) The prices are very good and good choice but what makes me 2 stars is the service especially of a woman who works in the butcher is the most rude and the pareser does not like his work and I wonder if not he likes because he does not go alone makes the store look bad like carniseros parese that pay them for a second because they move slower than a turtle is orrible their service and as it weighs them attend and for that they are there and they work there. The owner should see that and and take care of more of their workers. The service to the client is the most important thing in a business.

(Original)
Los precios estan muy bien y buen surtido pero lo que hace que yo le de 2 estrellas es el servicio sobre todo de una mujer que trabaja en la carniceria es de lo mas grosera y al pareser no le gusta su trabajo y me pregunto que si no le gusta por que no se va solo hace ver mal a la tienda al igual que los carniseros parese que les pagan por segundo por que se mueven mas lentos de una tortuga es orrible su servicio y como que les pesa atender y pues para eso estan ahi y trabajan ahi. El dueño deveria ver eso y y atenderse mas de sus trabajadores. El servicio al clienete es lo mas importante en un negocio.<//Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) This store is the worst that I have ever experienced, it is a disgusting store, meat on the verge of decomposition, very dirty and as if that were not enough, a whole swarm of flies in the butcher's area, and the ants in the bread, no I understand how the people who always buy there don't notice or don't care,
Where is health, how do the inspections pass? I invite people to be a little more demanding and to clean and keep the flies especially outside the store, the best market is Petaluma Hill rd.

(Original)
Esta tienda es lo peor que yo a experimentado, es una asquerocidad de tienda, carne en punto de descomposición,  muy sucia y por si fuera poco todo un henjambre de moscas en área de la carnicería, y de pilón las hormigas en el pan, no entiendo como la gente que siempre compran ahí no se fijan o no les importa,
Donde está salubridad como es que pasan las inspecciones? Yo invito la gente a que sean un poco más exigentes y que agan que limpien y mantengan las moscas especialmente fuera de la tienda, la mejor lolas market es la de petaluma Hill rd.</Review>

<name>Matt< /name><Date>1618461805930<//Date><Rating>1<//Rating><review>The only reason why a store like this is useful is because of the fitting rooms where you can try clothes on. So ask yourself what's the use of shopping for clothes at target if you can't try any clothes on because the dressing room is closed? I'll easily stay home and order off amazon.

I CAN USE YOUR BATHROOM BUT NOT THE DRESSING ROOM? great logic!</review>< Pics>

<Text>I made a quick stop here.  I was impressed with the helpfulness of the employees in the electronics department.  They took the time to answer questions and give there suggestions about streaming devices.  The store was clean and bright.  Two people who appeared to be managers were standing near the exit and were also helpful.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>This place does nothing at all they handle the mask situation so dumb it’s honestly sad they are covid hotspot and so many people walk in saying they have a “medical condition no proof” and they can just continue to walk in the mask mandate to lift is JUNE 15th not in may also the way they treat situations is god awful like the management needs help when it comes to guests and their team employees they don’t care about them at all< /Review>< Pics>

The manager of this store (Vannesa) is a pedantic to resolve a complaint or claim. He lacks experience is just screen the title of manager. Nobody is obliged to buy something if the price is not correct, I think that if in a line this price is for the same product, it does not say if it is only for one or if it is for two for a price, one is I am not a fortune teller for And if I don't want to buy it, I have the right to return it. They want to do it. Buy by force just for not making a cancellation. Just by holding the title of manager, they create a garbage of people to help others🤔🤨
suggestion put the prices well so that people do not see a different price. according to you when paying is another👌<//Review>

First off the store was clean and the associates super helpful.  At the self checkout I had a wrapped bunch of bananas with a bar code, I scanned the item and the registered asked how many - being a guy I thought OK, there are six bananas in the bunch so I was ready to punch in 6.  The associate came over and said, because the bananas were wrapped it was 1 bunch for $1.79, thus she saved me $1.79x 5 !!!!   This is going  above and beyond to assist a customer - well done!< /Text>

I accidentally left my daughter’s very expensive club foot bar in a shopping cart (had to take it off to get her in the cart seat and just left it off). I came back an hour later hoping it had been turned in. After finding out it hadn’t, the manager and a wonderful employee looked through rows of shopping carts to help me find it. So grateful for the humanity and kindness they showed at the end of a long work day in the middle of the week.</Review>

The cleanest 🎯 around. I often use self checkout and there’s always the same woman with blonde hair working the checkout and she is one of the nicest people!</Text>

<Text>I tried to order items online.  One of the items was out of stock.  Target canceled the item, but didn't refund the charge on my credit card.  I had to cancel the order and go into the store.  When I got there, Target was out of stock on other items and brands I wanted and I had to go to Walmart to find them.<//Text><response>None<//response><UserId.>118330904313025231345< /UserId.><Gmap_id>0x808ff8bea15d38ef:0x842b7afbfd14fd66<//Gmap_id>< pics>

Excellent customer service from good and personable employees. I was very impressed by how well the employees work as a team to professionally provide curbside pickup during a busy near closing hour. Walmart should take notes on what quality service is, and how to train their employees to be professional, effecient, and provide a good experience. Target is by far excelling at providing a excellent curbside pickup experience!<//review>

<Review>5+ stars to this specific target location.
Thank you soo much to Vanessa who went above and  beyond to help me.  I had dropped a toy that I purchased as a gift for my daughter and couldn’t find it, was very heart broken at the thought of loosing it. Her and her team helped review cameras .
Thank you thank you ! We need more people like her.
Truly appreciate her customer service.
Will be definitely coming back to this target !

And Vanessa God Bless ❤️</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

The one of best for my regular groceries, clothing snd many kids related shopping. They keep quality products and my wife and i like shopping here frequently.
The Redcard is awesome, you get free deliveries and 5% discount on purchase of all items online. Discount is for in store purchase.
Best part which no other store offers is returns upto 4 months with red card purchase, do rest assured if you don’t like you have enough time.</text>

<Review>Red card savings quality and good prices... the new look at Target and better trained personnel has made a big difference.  I am a big Amazon shopper the new Target gets me off-line and into the store.  The new store pick-up is easier and more convenient.  Staging is everything for me add great quality with current trends and it works for me<//Review>< UserId.>

<review>The store needs to do a better job of making sure customers that enter respect the rules and put on a mask. Twice now I have seen people without masks in store. This is most unacceptable!
Firstly, Covid-19 is spreading rapidly in Contra Costa county, second, it is a public order. The order requires businesses that are open during the pandemic to ensure their workers and volunteers wear face coverings, and to not serve or allow entry to anyone not wearing face coverings. This needs to be respected otherwise even those wearing masks have an increased chance of breathing in particles of Covid-19 through gaps in their masks, or by picking up products somebody has breathed on or talked over, or transmission of particles through the eyes. That is why face masks are worn. It doesn’t help that some people just don’t get it or care to get it but the store has to enforce it at the very least to protect its staff and customers.<//review>< Pics>

The online ordering was much easier than other places I have tried. I was in a hurry and the online system filtered items available at a glance and available for pickup in 2 hours. It was extremely efficient.  I didnt have to keep clicking around and resetting filters. Once I placed the order, it was done very quickly and ready for pickup within 1 hour . My mom picked it up with no issues.< /review>

Target is a great place to shop, especially if you want to get something quick. Staff are mostly helpful, and their brands like Archer Farms and Market Pantry are good as well. Would reccomend this store to some people.<//Text>

I wish to acknowledge 'Jacqueline' in the produce area and 'Wendy' at the self checkout .  Both staff members were professional, courteous, knowledgeable and helpful.  They are assets to Target.  Thank you, 'Jacqueline' and 'Wendy'.<//review>

I love this Target!  It’s clean, the employees are friendly, the customer service counter has never been anything but accommodating!  If anything, I wish it carried certain products that other locations do, but it’s not a big deal b/c I can always order online and it gives me reasons to visit the other the locations.  If anything, my only complaint is that the Starbucks line at that location can get a bit long, but it’s not b/c the employees are bad, it’s just busy.</Review>

Target staff are courteous and very much on top of things. This along with the fact that everything at the store  and online is displayed easy for purchase makes a great experience to shop there! Additionally, where needed the staff matched prices that were lower after cross checking the details of the price match.< /Review>

<Review>Customer service was the absolute worst I have ever had.  I placed an online order for pick up.  Everything would have been great except that the employee handed me a clearly broken item and when I pointed it out and asked for him to get me a new one his response was "NO".  He said it was my responsibility since I touched it to go get a new one and stand in the return line to exchange it.  He hands me a broken item and somehow it becomes MY responsibility to replace it?  Are you kidding me?  Never again!<//Review>< pictures>

I love target but I really wish they would amp up their baby department. Everytime I go there it's so picked over. They are constantly out of baby medicines and low on baby food. I've gone on all different days of the week and its always the same. With Babys R Us out of business Target could really step it up and at least have their shelves stocked.</text>

Shopping at Target have always been an amazing experience. Got my first children Mickey Mouse  luggage in 2001, Lol. My Sister's and I always experience a cheerful sensation of happiness and shared multi giggles when we go through your seasonal merchandise. such: your Christmas ugly sweaters and clothing. You guys are extremely clever! Love you forever and ever!< /Text>

<Review>Target!? What happened to your clothes section!?  You’ve been my go-to place and tonight I walked in and then back out. Clothes all over the floor, hangers strewn all around, and the clearance section....holy cow!!! Don’t know where to start. The Goodwill looks more inviting!  Spend some $$, hire staff, and clean up!< /Review>< Date>

Just your typical California shopping experience: high prices, limited selection, rude people, and too few cashiers. How in the hell do people live here?</Text>

We purchased a Disney gift card for our daughters trip to Disney.  When she got down there it did not work.  Disney instructed her to call Target since she had receipt and authorization and Target told her it was Disney’s fault.  So here my child is with another family down in Anaheim with no way to get into Disneyland.  When I went in to the store and spoke with assistant manager Amber she was completely insensitive and informed me that Target is just a third party seller and does not stand behind these gift cards.  I find it hard to believe that a corporation such as this would sell something that they can’t back.  In addition even with the receipt Amber says it is non refundable!!!!  Funny thing is my daughter wasn’t the only one whose park hopper wouldn’t work.  Another girl in her party whose mom bought it at Target as well hers didn’t work either.  I will tell everyone I know about this atrocious customer service and I will drive the extra 5 minutes to Walmart so that I know longer support a company that doesn’t support its customers.< /text>

A little disappointed, I was in line behind a target employee who had a basketful of items. I had two items the girl with the employee suggested she let me go ahead of her....store employee did not agree. This seems to be a customer service fail.<//review>

Good Target, but they need more cashiers & more merchandise. They run out of stuff a lot. There are so many families in the area that they don't have enough supply for everyone. It's kind of sad.</review>

<review>Unethical business! I reserved 25 Ryan Toy’s Eggs online and received a barcode confirmation that they were ready for pickup with 20% off. I called the store to confirm they were ready for pickup and they assured me they were. After driving 3 hours in traffic to get this special order, they said unfortunately we sold them to someone else. Thanks for ruining Christmas for my family by lying and selling them to someone to get full price.< /review><Name>Grace Morquecho</Name>< Resp>

Placed an order for in store pick-up from their website.  The following day I got an email that said the item was no longer available at the store, but that they would ship for free if I decided that was OK.  However, when you clicked on the link, it wouldn't work.  Called customer service and they found the same problem.  They wanted me to cancel the order and then  re-order, which would have fouled up my credit account for a few days.  I told them not worth it, to just cancel.  Very disappointed.</text>

They don't match their own app price. Also didn't need attitude from the lady at guest services. I wasn't using brickseek. I was using the target app that clearly showed the price in that store. I'm not a child how about you stop repeating the same thing and give me a actual answer/reason. Target is going down the drain. The app and store should be on the same page. If they aren't then what is the point.</Review>

<Review>This Target is an average Target. Starting to look old and run down

Pros:
It's usually stocked
They just put in a Starbucks, if you like that coffee
Has a small market section

Cons:
Lines are long
Perpetually messy
It's hard to find help if needed
You can probably find most electronics/bigger items cheaper online<//Review>< pictures>

It was pretty satisfying. For an artsy person, Target had a good selection for arts and crafts.<//Review>

<review>Before I begin my explanation of the reason for the rating I gave, I would like to mention the one positive and praiseworthy section of this location, and that is the food service department which is excellent! I can't say enough about how friendly, courteous, and professional the staff (all of them) are whenever I have been a customer there.
If it were possible to give this Target store a "negative star" rating, then I'd have done so. I have never felt so disappointed and insulted as a customer as I have every time I've shopped at this location with the exception of the Target @ Century Plaza Shopping Center, but for a different reason altogether. I will not shop here again because of how consistent they are with causing me to feel like I am  about to describe in this review. I am not a thief, ever. Not just because I'm being followed around the store. I HAVE ALWAYS had money to purchase the items I intended to get, and in the rare occurrence when I was just a little bit short, I left the items at the register with the cashier.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Fairly nice Target, has a big grocery section.

Parking is better than some of the local ones and the store is big so it never feels crowded.< /review>

I've been shopping here for years but the customer service and management has gone downhill over the past year or so. They're rude, not willing to help and make up their own policies. Won't be going to this location anymore!! Customer service is 10x better in Pittsburg!!<//review>

Well I have to be honest I work for Goodwill but I still really enjoy shopping at the stores. You can find some really nice things for your home, also great deals on clothes makeup and shoes. I could go on and on it takes some time to look through everything but thats what makes it fun in my opinion.</review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I found a beautiful XL vessel here with the best price.  After visiting 6 different Goodwill in the last 2 months I think I enjoyed this one the most, compared to other Goodwill this one is not pricing way to high. In southern CA thrift stores are getting so expensive, they want to sell everything like new and is very annoying especially the Goodwill at Knnot and La Palma Ave. That store is the worst, overpriced even more than Homegoods across the street and crowded shelves🤮< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-cTRKq0zLr-JWbC0islxN579uZyGma64KGNte=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMW47lBdgaCtwA9-SqKTdupOHosU9SOGyHiNclt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

Worst Goodwill I've ever been to, after 3 or 4 tries I give up. They change the tags before the sale so nothing good ever comes up 50% and they make the tag colors so close together that you get to the register only to find NOTHING you got is on sale, and the full price is a FDASHING ripoff seeing as THEY GOT IT FOR FREE and ITS USED AS ALL GETUP<//Text>

Wide selection but why do they have so much brand new stuff? 🤔 they had a wide selection of Halloween stuff right before the holiday. So it’s not just leftover from a store</text>

I had bought a box at target yesterday for 16.99 on sale so thought they were a good deal. Brought them to the counter and the girl suggested I changed the price and I absolutely would never do that. She was so rude so I went and grabbed another box off shelf tagged the same price. Then she suggested I changed the price on all of them the little witch couldn't admit they had been tagged wrong ....needless to say that my van was loaded to the gill with donations so I took them to savers in YL instead. I had went to this goodwill for years but never again!!!!<//Review>< Pics>

The donations or taken in back and help is there for to unload your donations.  The store is not the cleanest and you may find decent items from time to time. They do sell new clothes and toys<//review>

<text>Well I go to plenty of Goodwill stores and this is the only store that has a tiny selection of the color of the week . It never fails, whatever color is the 50% percent off, you really don't find much of that color in store. Somethings are really over priced for what they are worth. I mean Goodwill does get everything for free.  Anyways, not all negative,  I do sometimes find a good find.</text><Date>1460653868512< /Date><gmapID>0x80dcd5d0bb37bc2d:0x5444aafb2e966a16<//gmapID>< Rate>

<review>Been going here for years for breakfast. Finally went for lunch and it was delicious. The Lobster BLT was SO good—it came with good chunks of sweet claw and the bacon was so good with it. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was super good as well. Can’t wait to try dinner next! The service here is always great, staff are super sweet.< /review>< pics>

Great food and drinks. What sales this place is the location and view. What topped off my experience was the warm and engaging waitress named Caitlin. Nothing but good things in store of her and the restaurant she serves. Thanks guys!

Food was excellent! Fresh ingredients and nice presentation.. Service was very good. Right on the edge of the beach so the view of the ocean was great. Validation for parking next door was a good thing since there was little to no street parking within a reasonable distance. Will definitely be back.</Review>

< Review>
The food was honestly the best. I asked for water and never got it. We checked in in swim suits because it is right on the beach as we went for our table that is when they informed us that the swim suits were not good in the restaurant. I just didn't care for the way we were informed as she asked my companion if I had a shirt vs asking me.< /Review>

Fantastic as always...Given the current state of things the spacing was more than adequate...all tables more than 6ft from the next table.  As usual for the Seafood lover that I am, the selection was phenomenal from all sections of the menu. The clams in white wine & butter sauce was beyond savory and to die for. There is lighter faire in the Casual Pates section.  Drinks were spot on and paired well with my food. This is a great spot to sip a libation and watch the sunset.</Text>

This place does great food. We came during coronavirus, so there was no seating, but we were staying close by at the Catamaran resort. I got the Fish and chips, Mrs P got the seafood taco trio. Winners for both of us. I think it would have been even better if they were seating, as my fish was soggy on the bottom, but still amazing. I had a bite of the tacos too. Amazing food, really amazing. I highly recommend this place.< /Text>

We did not have a good experience here. We were served moldy fruit with our breakfast. The waitress offered a replacement food item but we did not want to eat anything else from this restaurant. Coffee was served cold and the food we did eat was expensive and not good tasting. I do not recommend eating here. Spend your money elsewhere.</Text>

Very nice view!  Decent food but not a vet wide food or beer selection.  I have been there a few times, and feel that the service is sub-par.< /Text>

This place does great food. We came during coronavirus, so there was no seating, but we were staying close by at the Catamaran resort. I got the Fish and chips, Mrs P got the seafood taco trio. Winners for both of us. I think it would have been even better if they were seating, as my fish was soggy on the bottom, but still amazing. I had a bite of the tacos too. Amazing food, really amazing. I highly recommend this place.< /review>

Always delicious. I had the clam chowder with large bites of clams and the lobster salad. I am not a fan of dressing so i opted for oil and balsamic vinegar, was it AMAZING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</Text>

I had the Steak and Lobster Benedict, both were cooked perfectly and on top of a lightly toasted focaccia.

The potatoes and asparagus were also done well and it was a great meal altogether.

Service was outstanding and the views were just over the top.

Highly recommend< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>I used to frequent this business regularly and the food isn't bad. My issue with this business is the lack of employee diversity. I've seen a couple of African American men clearing tables regularly, but rarely any servers or hostesses.  Hire more people of all nationalities!

The patio dining offers great views of the boardwalk, the beach, and the ocean.  I had a delightful cocktail while we waited for lunch, The Drunken Mermaid - just the right amount of zip.  We had the Poke Tacos as an appetizer, they were very good, nice flavors.  However, our lunch entrees were just mediocre.  I had the fish and chips, the fish portion tasted fresh from the freezer, yet the French fries were tasty.  My husband ordered the fish tacos and described them as "very average."

I would, however, re-visit World Famous to enjoy the views, the Drunken Mermaid, and the Poke Tacos!</text>

<text>On my recent trip to San Diego, we ate at this location 3 different times. Not because we actually liked it because it was convenient to the party of people we were traveling with. The food was good but not great. Heavy on the butter, salt and/or oil. Anything that had sauce in it was over sauced. Prices were a little higher than I would have normally liked to pay for the quality of food.

What really make this place worthwhile is the view. Definitely check the sunset times and time your dinner accordingly. You can definitely get an awesome sunset from just about anywhere you sit. They do have a covered and heated patio, the music isn't overly loud making conversation easy.

For large parties of 5 or more, I definitely recommend making reservations for holidays and weekends.<//text><userid>113063550057314900993</userid>< GmapID>

Excellent breakfast with a beautiful view of the beach. The seafood omelet may be the best I have ever had! Great place to feel the ocean breeze and enjoy a great meal while watching the waves.< /text>

Oceanfront setting is spectacular, but we came expecting one of their world-famous hamburgers and discovered only one on the menu. My date ordered that amazing monster, while I settled for crab cake sliders.  The sunset was spectacular and would return here again for that heart-stopping view.<//Text>

I’ve been coming to this restaurant with my family since I was a child and the food and service has always been great but I’m writing this review based on a unsatisfactory experience I had dining at World Famous over the weekend. My husband, our daughters, and my parents came in for dinner and we split the bill. When the server came to bring our card back, my husband’s debit card was missing from the folder. The card had been ran but only the receipts were in there. We told our server who claimed she put the debit card back in there. We stayed around for a while hoping the card would be recovered but it was not. Someone came to our table (maybe the manager?) to get my husband’s information saying she would flip the tables and look for the card after closing. We never even got a call back that night to follow up on this situation. Since we were staying in a neighboring hotel, the next morning we stopped in to see if there were any updates. We were basically just brushed off saying “oh yeah, you know the server said she put it in the folder and it must have fallen out.” This situation has been very inconvenient. We were leaving town the next day and were planning to use that card to buy gas for the trip home. Someone obviously picked up the card because there was a charge in California sending money to someone over Facebook pay, that was not us. I think it was very unprofessional and disappointing that no one ever followed up with us about this situation and the way it was handled.< /Text>

The food here is always amazing. Lobster BLT is incredible. Sat at the bar. Service from the bartender could of been better. He didn't once check back on us after our food came out, but the rest of the staff made up for it.</Review>

This was one of the best meals my husband and I have ever had! We don’t live in a state that has fresh seafood so this was a real treat. We were sent here by a local and were not disappointed! Their drunken mermaid drink was great, along with everything else we ate. Also, there were dolphins jumping and playing in the water right out front of where we were sitting. Dinner and a show!!</Text>

To any visitors stopping in San Diego,  you've got to trek on over to Pacific Beach and give them a try.  Fresh lobster tacos,  salad,  fish and more  - we didn't want to leave.  Those lobster tacos I could eat plenty.  They will validate your parking so don't let that deter you.  Just park in the garage adjacent to restaurant.

< Review>
2nd Honeymoon after 22 years of marriage, we wanted a dinner on the beach, and weren't disappointed!  We went around 6pm, and only had to wait 30 minutes, and got a table right next to the window. Service was great, views were spectacular and it was a great experience and memory for us!  Husband ordered a shrimp dish, and I ordered a chicken/pasta/spinach dish, and they were both very good tasting! Overall, very pleased!</Review>

<Text>Drinks are good and there are a wide variety of cocktails. Best part is the fact that its on the beach and there are a lot of people watching opportunities. The lobster bisque was amazing and same with the tuna dish. Only negative was that the coconut shrimp and vegetables were a little too soggy with oil.</Text><user_name>Lauren Moses< /user_name>< user>

<text>The food and the view was amazing but the service wasn't the best. I can't actually say that about the service as a whole, it was just our server. She took our order and then she blew past us the rest of the time. We had to track her down to even get our bill. Everyone else in the restaurant was great, it was just unfortunate that our server had to be like that...<//text>< user>

The food is wonderful. We had the Khalua Hash and the Seafood Omelet both were delicious.  Seating is outside on their patio with an ocean view. It is our new stop for breakfast when we visit San Diego.</Text>

This was the best breakfast I've had in some time.

I had the Steak and Lobster Benedict, both were cooked perfectly and on top of a lightly toasted focaccia.

The potatoes and asparagus were also done well and it was a great meal altogether.

Service was outstanding and the views were just over the top.

Highly recommend<//text>

Niece had the filet with lobster add on, all great. Server was awesome and attentive and made sure to take extra caution with my niece's treenut allergy.

Super fun brunch spot on the boardwalk. You can say hi to your friends walking by! Their Surf & turf Bloody Mary is soul fuel. Loved the grilled salmon salad.< /review>

Fabulous location. It is worth waiting for the patio seats. Clam chowder was fabulous, and the Jicama Shrimp Tacos delicious. Definitely recommend...but reservations are a good idea if you don't have time to wait.< /text>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>I'm so sorry to say poor World Famous has definitely declined over the years. It used to be quite a quote-unquote fancy restaurant with excellent meals and manners.  The breakfast I had about noon was poorly made very poorly presented with the deadest left of lettuce I've ever been served. The waitress was okay. And the Kahlua Coffee was very good. I guess at least they can still make decent drinks. The location however is A #1 plus!< /Review><user_id>111694236257809028219<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

Good food. Good view. Service was great. Tap beers were warm. And the menu is limited due to covid 19. But other than that we enjoyed ourselves. Graham was our server and he did the best he could even though he was new. I would go again.< /review>

<Text>Lobster bisque. My sister-in-law once chose the lobster bisque as her last meal, should she ever end up on death row. I can't argue her choice. It's thick, robust, and full of bites of tasty lobster meat. Order it as a side to your entree, or snack light elsewhere and enjoy the bisque on its own.< /Text>< time>

My friends and I decided to order a little of everything and we had no complaints. From the salads , to the lobster bisque, to the filets with scallops, to the lobster tacos, to the lobster tails, this place is great and not overpriced.

First of all its great people watching the boardwalk,  and the surf !
And for me there Lobster Bisque is great, lobster salad rocks,  as does fresh fish entrees.
Turkey Brie Sandwich a total let down sucked the Turkey needs to be fresh roasted..
Always amazing service.  Come chill enjoy your stay..</review>

<Review>It might be world famous, but the question is for what? I spent over 15 minutes waiting for a table which is fine it shows this place must be good  or people are sunset starved. . I’ll never know. We were seated  at a filthy table that had not been wiped down. I Asked loudly to five waitress walking by, hey could you wipe down our table? We were obviously ignored. After another 15 minutes of not acknowledged we just went to the hostess who was chatting with four waitresses and said we are receiving zero and horrible service. We are out of here. She didn’t blink and eye or care. Makes me think this is the standard for this place. Don’t go! Go to any other oceanfront restaurant. I promise you I’ve saved you an hour of your time. You’re welcome.< /Review><userid>106387291911816326081</userid>< pictures>

<Review>We stopped in for lunch, as a group we ordered beer battered fish and chips, lobster BLT, calamari and the clam chowder. All of it was so good! The lobster BLT is a cold sandwich with huge chunks of lobster and 4 slices of bacon on top of "the fixings". The fish and chips were cooked to perfection and served with a dill tartar sauce that was amazing. The clam chowder was also perfect!

<text>Second Time here. First time about 1.5 years ago.  We arrived Mon Jan 30 about 2pm.  It wasn't too busy. They gave us an inside beach side table right away. A beautiful sunny clear day. probably about 70 degrees outside with no wind.

The five of us ordered 6 main dishes, 1 soup and and appetizer.  All were very very tasty.  The lobster bisque was hot, full body and tasty.  A good choice, not watery or thin.

Favorite appetizer (starter), hands down is Nut Crusted Brie
with mango chipotle glaze.  The Mango chipotle glaze was a big hit. Just enough spice to give you a pleasing pop for your taste buds, and you actually enjoyed the sweet taste of mango to contrast the Chipotle spice.  Could have just eaten the brie as a main meal.

We ordered the Crabcake Sliders as additional appetizer for our table… It was three dungeness crab cakes(each crab cake about the size of a swedish meat ball)  served in fresh baked brioche mini buns, sliced tomato, green leaf lettuce, thin red onion and house made caper tartar sauce with a side of crisp seasoned fries

The seasoned French fries came with 3 of our dishes.....really good fries, we think they were coated with a panko bread crumbs,  made them crispy, crunchy and irresistibly good.

I ordered the Sierra Mar Grilled Sea Bass prepared char grilled cold water seabass served over fresh avocado, roma tomato, bermuda onion, timbale drizzled with white balsamic dijon chive vinaigrette.  I was looking  for a non land meat dish, and this hit the spot.  If you like fish, you'll like this.

Fish and Chips, nice golden brown breading, and hit the spot with my friend.  They are Beer Batter Fish And Chips...cold water white icelandic cod fried in World Famous' micro brew beer batter served
with crispy fries and homemade tartar sauce

Poke tacos, a bit of a twist from how Hawaiian poke is served. It's made with fresh ahi tuna marinated hawaiian poke style, served in three crispy wonton taco skins over guacamole, ginger wasabi drizzle & sesame seeds.

If you like angel hair pasta and clam sauce, try World Famous' version: Capellini California, it's angel hair pasta tossed in a light clam garlic olive oil sauce with roma and sun dried tomato, fresh basil, spinach, asparagus, greek olives & grated parmesan cheese.

Lastly, Prime Rib Baguette thinly carved prime rib served in a french baguette with balsamic dressing, horseradish sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions and jack cheese.

Everything was delish, served quickly, hot and tasty.  Having our lunch at beach side on a sunny day is a plus plus.

This is a place we will definitely return to when we can.  We like the food and service a couple years ago, and we liked it this time.  Consistent it is!!.< /text></record>

<Review>Nice restaurant on the beach with ocean views from almost every seat. Great food and friendly staff.

The breakfast options are everything from omelets to eggs and bacon to breakfast burritos and pancakes. Breakfast here is solid.

Lunch offers everything from sandwiches to burgers to lobster to soup and everything in between. I love the Baja Chicken Sandwich.

There are definitely more delicious places in San Diego to eat but if you want a nice meal with ocean views, it doesn’t get better than World Famous.< /Review>< pics>

We waited on our food for over 40 minutes, in that time nobody ever came to check up on us or even acknowledge us. We almost got up and left. The restaurant was also extremely cold.< /Text>

<text>It wasn't that busy for a Friday night. We waited a bit for service. Our waiter was excellent! He was very helpful and guided us through the menu very well. The food was expensive, and just not that great. It was good, but not $50 for a 2 course good. All in all, friendly service, pretty food, fancy stuff, average taste.< /text>< pics>

I wanted to treat my incredible wife with a great evening. Not knowing the area, I picked World Famous from a million options in a google search. Excited for our evening even though we didn't know what to expect, we couldn't have found a better place. Our seafood was outstanding and the atmosphere could not have been more perfect. Trust me. Call and make a reservation and then enjoy the best night you could imagine in San Diego.< /review>

We had a great time here. They had a great selection of food and drinks. The food was fantastic. I had the filet with the scallops and everything was cooked perfectly and was seasoned well. I also had the clam chowder and it was great - I'm from New York where New England chowder is a staple and it was definitely just as great! The service was quick, attentive, and pleasant. I will definitely return here when I visit again.< /review>

This was a great place to eat.  I had the kona shrimp salad.  Yum!  I tasted the Alaska halibut  wrapped in a potato not.  It was light and tasty white meat.< /review>

<Review>We have walked past the World Famous dozens of times but haven't eaten there in years.  We made a reservation for about an hour before sunset for a table against the glass.  The view of the sunset was wonderful and the entertainment provided by the Boardwalk passerby's was also a treat.  The service was very good very good and when I asked about where the tuna was from in the seared ahi tuna salad, she said she could check, but thought I would enjoy one of the other salads more.
I ordered the shrimp salad and it was delicious.  I ran into a friend that had eaten the seared ahi tuna the next night, and he confirmed I'd made a good choice.</Review><user>106217946728670369342< /user></record></dataset><record>

Went to World Famous for breakfast on a weekday and it was a great time to go, the likelihood of finding nearby parking is much greater. It is located right by the beach so we took advantage and got a table in their terrace which was nice and toasty thanks to their heaters,  it's an enclosed area yet still outside. The service was very good with many servers checking our coffee and often just seeing if we needed anything.  Our main server was delightful,  she had a very positive and outgoing attitude. The food came fast once we ordered and I was happy to find vegetarian options.  I had the veggie hash which was very tasty. It was overall a great experience,  food, service and location were great!< /Text>

<review>We waited over 15 minutes to get service, we asked the waitress more than 4 times for certain things and never received anything, I had to walk to the back and get my own box, own straws, and condiments that we asked for. The man handing out the food was awesome and actually helped us out. We also asked to get the heater on several times and finally the man handing out the food did it so we tipped him. Our waitress was just socializing with her co workers the entire time. The service use to be amazing but it has gone completely downhill. Save your time and go somewhere else!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Happy hour has changed but one would ever know. The snippy waitress told us but there were no happy hour menus and the website has not been changed. This was 3 weeks ago, so I called them and asked about happy hour and they said it was changed but no one has changed their website STILL! Why change the happy hour after it has been the same all of this time and not even mention the changes on the website.< /Review>< pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>So visiting San Diego for the first time and this place came highly recommended for the fish tacos. Unfortunately they were no longer serving the tacos when we arrived (I think it's a happy hour thing). However, we ended up ordering these bacon and puff pastry wrapped asparagus things for appetizers which were fantastic. Then I ordered the cioppino for my meal.... OMG. Literally mind blown. Best dish of my entire trip and I would move to San Diego just to eat it regularly. The broth was flavorful and rich and there was a ton of delicious seafood. Plus some tasty bread to soak up some of the broth.  Do recommend!<//Text>< pics>

5 of us had breakfast there today & it was EXCELLENT. It was pretty busy in there but service was still reasonably quick & the food was better than any other restaurants we had on this trip. The potato’s are so tasty & crispy, eggs were made to order perfectly, & pancakes were good also. Bloody Mary’s were just basic though.< /Text>

First time having seafood tacos there - WORTH the $3/each! We had shrimp, fish and lobster. I could do without the lobster but highly recommend the fish. I'm not a battered fish girl for fish tacos but the batter was light and perfect and the piece of fish VERY generous! Had a bowl of clam chowder as well. Good but a tad pricey for the small portion (about a cup). Head out to see sunset if you get there early, or stop in for a post-sunset drink.<//review>< Response>

Great bloody mary and really enjoyed the breakfast burrito. We were staying next door so didn't have to deal with parking. Nice place right on the beach, awesome people watching. A little pricey but it's the waterfront.<//Text>

45 wasted dollars . Tried to get a table was told it was a wait I then just ask for take out and 3 separate groups of people were seated. Fish and chips ok at best . Cocktail sauce tasted like ketchup and very little horse radish. Your host specially said the calamari was fresh and the best . I recieved long chewy white square shaped strips.  Breaded and smoothered in I  dont know kind if sweet sauce. Needless to say not authentic calamari and nothing fresh . No better than long John's silver style fast seafood but way overpriced.< /review>

The fried shrimp tacos were very delicious. The service however was a little slow to start and throughout. We were also trying to get a seat on the covered patio area but the hostess said there was a waiting list for the 5 empty tables available. I'd rather go to Oscars next time.</text>

The food was great, my mai tai rocked. Wait staff in general was very nice, but our waitress seemed rushed and our overall service was very slow, and had to wait too long for the bill. Would have been 5 stars otherwise.<//text>

<review>Went to World Famous for breakfast on a weekday and it was a great time to go, the likelihood of finding nearby parking is much greater. It is located right by the beach so we took advantage and got a table in their terrace which was nice and toasty thanks to their heaters,  it's an enclosed area yet still outside. The service was very good with many servers checking our coffee and often just seeing if we needed anything.  Our main server was delightful,  she had a very positive and outgoing attitude. The food came fast once we ordered and I was happy to find vegetarian options.  I had the veggie hash which was very tasty. It was overall a great experience,  food, service and location were great!</review><user>101387913414934242974< /user>< rating>

<Name>Malachi Schreiner<//Name><review>As a professional cook I am very critical about where the wife and I eat, often resulting in delivery pizza or drive thru options. I had the sea bass, very good. She had the scallops, they were decent. Scallops were cooked well, just not the best flavor profile in my humblest of opinions. Niece had the filet with lobster add on, all great. Server was awesome and attentive and made sure to take extra caution with my niece's treenut allergy. Would most definitely return if ever in the area again.</review>< Pics>

This place is unforgettable.  Right on the ocean, beautiful views.  Here's a trick:  eat at the bar and order a drink, (even a soft drink) and then you can order phenomenal specials for incredible prices!!  Unforgettable lobster tacos for $2.50 each.  Really.     Don't miss this place.< /review>

<username>Craig Vellar<//username><pictures>None< /pictures><Review>In the past, this was one of our go to places for a great meal. We went twice this trip because the first experience was not good. Food was less than mediocre and the service was horrible. Our second experience was even worse. It took over an hour for us to receive our food. We spoke with the manager who NEVER CAME BACK TO THE TABLE. He did not want to even try and make it right. In fact, he wanted to argue with us about our experience on the way out the door. Well never go back.</Review></record>

Great time, very family friendly and good drinks. Food was good too and very sizeable portions. Ended up ordering more than we could eat.
We sat at the bar area because the hostess said there were no tables available. By the time we left there were still a number of tables of all sizes open. Didn't end up being an issue, perhaps there are issues with reservation no shows.</Text>

Terrible service. Took 15 minutes for someone to get our drink order. Took them even longer to get us a straw. We asked 3 waiters to fix the outside heater all of whom acknowledged the request but did not fix it. On the 4th try one employee was able to get us the straw we asked for and had the heater up and running within seconds. After finishing our meals, we asked for the check and a to-go box twice but did not get a response from our waitress, we then asked (whom I assumed to be the manager) if he could go get them, which was followed with a "yes" and then proceeded with him telling our waitress to go do it. The waitress took another 15 minutes before returning with just the check claiming to be coming right back with the to-go box. She then proceeded to have a very long conversation with the table next to us before taking their order for another 10 minutes. In which time we went to the bar for a box, payed the check, and were on our way out by the time she finally decided to get to it. I would not recommend this restaurant.<//Review>

Chef was excellent! Food was delicious. Our waitress was extremely slow (full story below). Scenery was beautiful. Maybe will try again and give more positive review.

Full story:
We're not impatient people, however, when you're practically choking and need a drink but the waitress takes 5 minutes to come out from the back, it's ridiculous. We weren't the only table she inconvenienced either because her other tables were complaining aloud about her service.< /Text>

Not worth the wait time or the price. at $25-$30 a plate you would hope at least one bite was good from the soup to the entre nothing to write home about. our waitress was horrible. We do have to give credit to who I believe was the manager, he is the only one to check on us and let my husband order 2 orders of oysters after our waitress informed us that was only allowed to be ordered in the bar, and wasn't willing to check for us when my husband asked......<//review>

Have had good brunch here before but dinner is FANTASTIC. Enclosed patio for watching activity on the boardwalk, beachgoers, and sunset at the ocean. Perfect for groups, colleagues, or romantic date night. Valet parking option takes away the stress of finding a spot in this popular area.

We always love the crabcakes, lobster bisque (absolutely delicious!!), and fresh seafood entrees. Not to mention some very tasty cocktails. Highly recommend.<//Review>

The view is amazing. The food was great. Lots of different beers, wines, and cocktails. The reason I gave a 4 star rather than a 5 star is because of our server. He seemed like he didn't want to be there, forgot some drinks, and never refilled our water. Another server made sure we got what we needed though. My food came out 6 minutes after my family's food. I would go back to give it another try with a different server.< /Text>

Went on Sunday morning at ten o'clock. Was a twenty minute wait for a table but we were told there were some available seats in the bar area which there were. We sat there with our three year old daughter and received no service and nor did the family of four next to us so we all left.
0ne star for service. Two stars for location on the beach and three stars because the food that was served to people around us looked good.
Therefore a three Star review which I feel was more than generous.</text>

We really enjoy stopping in for a quick sit down meal here. They have excellent shrimp and fish tacos, along with a wide variety of other dishes.

Great spot to people watch along the boardwalk, while enjoying a drink and bites.

Extremely popular breakfast place.  Be prepared to wait awhile for breakfast.  Lunch is much less of a wait and not so busy especially during regular week day. Many tables have good views of the ocean side, even some of the tables that are in the "indoor" (non patio) area.  Quiet, good service, good food, reasonable prices.  Overall a great place to eat.<//review>

We were sat right away and then we're not greeted (as several wait staff walked by) for over ten minutes. Took another 30 for a glass of wine to come out, which came out after the appetizer we ordered.

We were sat at a table with an awful slant to it and as such, my water glass fell over, spilling all over me. I then proceeded to wipe up the mess myself, as our server walked by THREE times without saying a word. She then came over and acted surprised that my water had spilled.

Food was mediocre at best. But the service was just about the worst I've ever seen in a restaurant.

For a place called "World Famous" it didn't even CLOSE to live up to that. Will never return.</Review>< time>

Every view was just like we were eating on Pacific Beach (without the sand).  Service was great and the Maine Lobster BLT was to live for!  Soups were great and the drinks!  We ate from the brunch menu on Sunday and the lunch menu.  Highly recommended and priced just right! Don't look anywhere else just go here!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Horrible.  Hostess was the worst. Got there just after the opened, took 15 minutes to get seated in EMPTY restaurant. Asked for ocean window seat. Told to wait????? We had to ask for manager to seat my handicapped dining companion.   Waitress was good. Food took a long time but it was delicious.  Used the delay to use the restroom. It was filthy, obviously had not been cleaned from day before.
Will never go to that location again.</Text>

Im not sure" world" applys here, but good enough for many tourist with kids that are hungry. The bar menu is lacking for me the meat eater, fish folks will find it satisfing. The bathrooms are smelly. I was recommended this place from a local, but just didn't get it. Nice ocean view. I'll probably pass next time.</text>

My boyfriend’s sister suggested this place for our entire group and I was a little weary because of the location but the food was decent. Honestly what you come for here is the view, it’s right up against the ocean with nothing obstructing you but people on the beach and the boardwalk. I didn’t love my food, but the family did! Maybe it was what I ordered which was the veggie hash. It was all bell peppers and little potatoes, I got more potatoes from my boyfriend and his father because their meals gave them 5x more than my hash. I got the macadamia nut strawberry mango banana (lol) pancake and it was delicious but the batter was spilling out everywhere the bananas were “cooked” in. I had to cut those out because I’m pregnant and uncooked food is dangerous, maybe they should just slice the bananas and put them on top with all the other fruit and it would be perfect.<//Review>

Came, saw, decided to try somewhere else. Very nice place right there on the Ocean front however I found the menu lacking. I'm sure they serve great food just not much selection in the steak department  Draws a young crowd for sure. Party on peeps🤗<//text>

My friend and I met for breakfast, which we ate in the oceanfront terrace to enjoy the view of the high surf. My California omelette was quite tasty and the coffee free-flowing. This is a classic PB institution with reliable and good but not outstanding food. You go there to enjoy the view but discover surprisingly decent food and drink which is often absent from tourist hot spots on the boardwalk. Definitely among the better choices along the boardwalk.</text>

< Review>
My wife and I had been here before a few years back; for breakfast and for dinner. The food was great as well as the views. Having had this experience, we headed over for breakfast this morning. The place was mostly empty with maybe a half dozen 2 tops and one larger party of 10ish over in the corner; what one would expect for a Monday morning. We walked in and were seated right away by a pleasant young lady. We were waiting about 5 minutes without being acknowledged. I took a look around and counted 3 servers on the floor, all tending to the large party in the corner. Deciding to cut them some slack, we continued to wait. 5 more minutes. And wait some more. After about 15 minutes of not one server touching base with us, we left. (thinking back to our previous experience, I recall having a lack of service previously as well.) NO food, no matter how good it is, was worth the impatience of this level of service. Additionally, the dining room had a more than subtle scent of a urinal. NEVER again, World Famous. You are officially off my list. 2 stars taking into consideration my previous food experience; otherwise it would have been 1 star. We did end up getting breakfast at Woody's (which is directly next door) for about half the cost.< /Review>

You can't beat the view!  It is literally on the boardwalk across from the sand.  It is always a fun atmosphere and the staff are always a joy.  The food is great, whether you want seafood or something from land you can't go wrong with World Famous.</text>

Best lobster bisque ever!! The service is pretty great. The parking can be difficult right out front but for $7 ~$10 w/tip you can get valet. The other option is a parking garage just east of the restaurant. It says $10 an hour with $40 max but they give you a 3 hour validation!< /Review>

At first there was 4 of us and the next day there was 6, but both night and day the service was awesome, the view was great and we had a lot of fun. For single girls, the eye candy is great. A shout out to Julianne for Thursday night 4 person chillin' table and to Zach on Friday morning for putting up with our 6 person day drinking table. He's got some thick skin.
A big shout out to 6'4" as he put up with us and made us feel welcome at the restaurant even though we were obnoxious (well, I was anyway). 4'10" says hi!!!</text>

<text>I LOVE this place so much that I had my rehearsal dinner here in 2009. They were extremely accommodating and everything was perfect!
We eat here one monday a month now to catch their half off the bar menu. I even take my kids (4 and 6) who love their lobster bisque and fish tacos.</text>< Rating>

This place features lobster.  It's famous for lobster tacos on wed.  They're not bad.  I preferred the lobster BLT.  It was really good but the slaw was The Bomb.   As a side, it shines beyond the feature dish.  Service sucked at the hostess stand, but once seated (either at bar or dining room) was pretty good, friendly,  and not too slow for a beach front restaurant.  Would go back....but for the slaw.</text>

I've been here many times because the valet is so easy. The atmosphere changes for dinner and gets quite a bit fancier. I enjoy the dinners, but personally I really like the tacos for lunch and beer while I sit in my beach get up. There's fixed Windows to the ocean so you don't get the breeze like other places, but really good for blocking the crowd noise or the cold.<//review>< Resp>

<Text>Came in not knowing too much about the place. There are two areas: the restaurant and bar. Restaurant prefers reservations but the bar allows you to order smaller portions and immediate seating. I ordered a fish taco and calamari taco which were quite tasty! Little bit noisy but the ocean view is awesome!</Text><username>gee moi</username><Rating>4< /Rating>< gmapID>

< Review>
From out of town, came here as suggested by our hotel. Had a truly excellent margarita followed by perhaps the best calamari I’ve ever had. Thick pieces I could cut with a fork. My 7 year old, who is not an adventurous eater, loved it. And the prime rib...I don’t even know what to say. It was excellent.< /Review>

We had dinner twice while on vacation. Its a nice layout. Adequate bar area, glassed in beach view tables and a dining room inside too. Food was decent. Service seemed a little out of sync. Tv's for football and a great 1/2 price happy hour...(crowded).</text>

Very good food but service was a bit slow. Took a while to get a forgotten side after the ffood was served. Food quality was good, food was hot, drinks were excellent. The view is amazing.(2016)
AMENDMENT: Had great service this time, nothing forgotten, amazing foid & coctails. (2019)</review>

<pics>None</pics><text>Not a great experience. The food was overpriced and just ok. However, the biggest reason for just one star was that it took forever. We sat down around 7pm (after waiting for almost 30 minutes to be seated) and didn’t get our check until just before 9pm. Most of that 2 hrs was waiting for the food.

<Text>Good food, table service was pretty good as well, however in the evening the hostesses, wait staff, etc were all standing around seemingly ignoring a short line of folks waiting to be seated while they flirted and played with their phones. A manager finally addressed the issue but service was poor this time. Seems to depend on what staff is working. Great beach views! I'd recommend going for breakfast, great service during that time.</Text>< pics>

Can't really beat the location. Breakfast was pretty good and the portions were good size. Word of warning: Parking is almost non-existent, so give yourself plenty of time to look for parking and be prepared to walk.< /Text>

Absolutely love all the fresh seafood and the homie feel. Fancy but not too fancy. Always Pleasant servers. Always a great view. The clam chowder is amazing. Tuna tartare. Shrimp tempura. Even the prime rib is great. I could eat here three times a day if I could when I visit San Diego< /review>

Great service!! Excellant food. I ordered 2 fried eggs and a bowl of fruit. Eggs were good cooked well! And fruit was delicious, pineapple, grapes, cantaloupe, honey due.   Twas good! View was amazing, right along the beach!! Literally hop the wall and take a dip! Our sevier was great! We has a large group. His name was Zach! Nice man, very attentive to us all. Bathroom is down a hall and to the right, but was clean and had to stalls one for handicapped. I would go back!< /Text>

Food was good, staff was great, view was great!  I wouldn't say 5 star food but the staff and view for sure made up for it!  Would return again, even if the clams are a little Sandy :)</Text>

Right on the beach, laid back atmosphere, and low prices. I wish the servers covered up more. I was there to have dinner with friends and didn't need their exposed areas near my food. Otherwise, it was great! Shrimp tacos were tasty.<//Text>

<Text>Had to bring it down a star during this visit because $10 for the ruby red cocktail seems pretty spendy during happy hour. That being said if you can get there on a Monday for the half price appetizers-that is a good deal! They are prettydelicious, but they did run out of the sourdough bread bowl for the lobster bisque.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

The lobster tacos rocked... however they do get soggy if you can't eat them fast enough. The guacamole was very tasty as well. It was fresh and made in the kitchen. Two dolphins were playing with some Surfers while we were eating. Fun to watch and eat while dining. I would go back.< /Review>

< Review>
I had high hopes for this place, especially given the name. After we were seated, it took at least 15 minutes for our waitress to even greet us. We had enough time to decide what we wanted for our entire meal before we even received water or our drinks. The waitress that did eventually come was not friendly and made it seem like we were a burden when we were asking questions about their wine selection. We ordered our entire meal right then, and our wine didn’t even come out until after we had finished our appetizer. My boyfriend’s water spilled all over him due to the table being broken and slanted, and when he was scrambling to wipe up the mess, not a single waiter or waitress offered to help or get us a rag. Our waitress even SAW him cleaning it up, walked by and ignored it, and then acted shocked when we told her we needed another one and some rags because of what happened. The food was very overpriced for the quality, but the service is what warranted the 2 star review. Awful service, and subpar food.< /Review>

Has to be the worst food I've had since I've been in cali, To be a known seafood restaurant worst salmon I've ever eaten no taste at all pure fishy taste. Then the ribs was cold, mashed potatoes was cold. All of this World Famous food for 108.00 dollars wasn't worth 50.00 dollars sorry, I'm from Indy and they actually know how to make salmon and serve you warm mashed potatoes for a lot less money as well. Then dont even get me started on my dinner the chicken was dry as hell. Told them no mushrooms it was loaded with them I mean come on it wasn't even that busy it was Sunday night. OVERALL THE PLACE SUCKED.< /Review>

This spot never disappoints. Brought my mom for the first time for her birthday and she loved it so 5 stars for that. Servers are great, food is just enough to get you full but not so much you take the left overs..or maybe it's just me that I eat a lot haha

Got the wipe out dish and it was so much good food. Left one pancake. They were so fluffy I was crying...the bacon was perfectly grilled, and thick. Fresh squeeze orange juice, was that...fresh.

<review>Extremely disappointed. The atmosphere was cool with a great view, but my friend and I got food poisoning!!! Then I remembered they were closed for a minute after an employee had Hep A during the San Diego outbreak. I’m  completely disgusted now. The food wasn’t very good and service was slow, so won’t be missing anything by not going back.< /review>< gmapID>

<Text>This was the first restaurant my family and I tried in San Diego - we loved it ! The cocktails were well mixed and well balanced (not to much bar syrup, not too much alcohol). Scallops were cooked perfectly, and so was the cod. Service is slower but how could it not be as good food takes time to prepare. Worth the wait . So - order up some cocktails and watch the sunset on the perfect view of the Pacific you'll have if you sit on the patio. Was a great experience. We also had a 6 and 7 year old - totally family friendly !< /Text>< pics>

The only reason I’m giving it 2 stars, is because the calamari was good and the wait wasn’t long, other then that there are better restaurants out there.
I don’t know if I’m just really high end, or expect to much but I personally wouldn’t come back.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>Insult upon injury: ruined birthday dinner for wife and daughter. Server brought a complimentary cake for another table and shift manager then promised (2) complimentary cakes to go in 5 minutes after paid and left a big tip for overdone steak. Twenty minutes later he ignores question about where cakes are -- then when I asked another server about the cakes, manager got in my face and asked if I was asking about my 'FREE' cakes. Very insulted, I left and went to my family empty handed. Go stick 'em 'world famous.'< /text>< pics>

We were visiting our nephew and his wife to meet your new grand niece when we came across this restaurant. They were booked, but there was only a 20 minute wait around 6pm. What a treat it was. Excellent food, friendly and lively atmosphere. Attentive staff. We sat right by the window and were able to enjoy a sliver of a sunset. I had the Brussel Sprouts, then the Surfside Shrimp Bowl with the Garden Salad with their creamy balsamic dressing. It's a party in your mouth! I will be referring this joint to everyone I know.< /Text>

<user_name>James Carter</user_name><review>Inconsistent!  Brought my business here twice and the first experience was good, I particularly enjoyed a scallop appetizer.  Next visit ordered a trio plate, including the scallop.  This time my first bite of scallop also included about a half teaspoon of what I hope was just sand.  I say I hope because I can't be certain what this course and flavorless substance was.  But it literally ground against my teeth as I chewed the one time, and couldn't be broken down with my teeth.  It obviously was not meant to be injested.  It took about a minute to work all of these little stones from my mouth, from between my teeth, and around my gums.  Horrible!  Then what truly made the experience unpleasant was the host, and this was on Mother's day evening, insisting there was some issue with the server, when the lone concern I made him aware of was this foreign substance in my food.  I'd never go back here.  There's an unacceptable level of ineptness.<//review><user_id>103543340768117352588<//user_id><response>None< /response><date>1558114502704</date></record>

< Review>
Walked in early to request a booth at 8 o" clock. Then walked in again at 3 to reconfirm a booth and that we're having an anniversary celebration.  7;40 we we're quickly walked to a table.  Nope we requested a booth for our Anniversary. Drinks came then salad came and before salad was done entree came
The scallops were runny and tasted like they were stored next to chemicals now cold. Dinner was removed and refunded. Husband was sad. I ate fillet and scallops.  I got very sick to my stomach and it took 6 days to feel a little better. Jen brought a box for leftovers and our check and left.  We weren't even asked if we wanted coffee.  Honestly ever one was rushing around like mice and rushing customers too.  Jen received no tip.  We always give at least a 30% tip but no one deserved anything. Last year we had a wonderful dinner there and even given cake on the house.  Obviously new management.  We won't be going there any longer.  Sorry<//Review>

I hosted a group of 9 friends there recently for a New Year's Brunch and when we asked in ADVANCE for separate checks, WF said that they offer only 4 checks no matter how large the group but the when they would only evenly split the checks for each two people, even if, i.e., one has only coffee and the other has a large meal and multiple drinks, cocktails, it takes the patrons experience into NO FUN fairly quickly, likewise they couldn't let us add the tips on our cards on the checks we were splitting!  SERIOUSLY will reconsider where we have our large get togethers so BOOKKEEPING DOESN'T TAKE OVER NOR BECOME THE FOCUS WHEN ADULTS WISH TO PAY THEIR OWN WAYS EASILY WHEN WE CHOOSE TO DONE OUT ESPECIALLY AS HERE YOU MUST BRING BOTH CASH IF YOU 0AY WITH CREDIT...</Text>

< Review>
Date of Visit: 5/23/17
View was great, which is what we ended up paying for.

The service was acceptable but our server was very quiet. 3 adults, 1 toddler, and our bill was well over $100. It's a bit ridiculous that the toddler’s pancakes were better than anything else we got and that they would charge $10.00 for plain pancakes. I ordered the Sausage, Mushroom Basil & Spinach omelet which was over-cooked (rubbery) and the only flavor I could taste was spinach. The sausage was cut up links (SUPER greasy) and I found no mushrooms at all. The side potatoes seemed to be par boiled, then tossed in oil with some parsley in it. There was no flavor to them at all. Overall, a major disappointment.

The orange juice was quite good, though.< /Review>

Terrible service, disappointing food. Our server was completely untrained and unaware of how to do his job. I had to ask for everything I needed that should have been obvious or at least offered (i.e. spoon to mix the sugar in my tea, sharp knife with my entree, basket of bread while we wait for the appetizer). Our entrees took around 45 min to an hour to be ready. Lobster tail was good but asparagus was bland and potato scallops were dry. Not sure this was worth $46 a plate. Crab cakes were tasty but very small about the size of a silver dollar. Pretty disappointed in place that has great reviews and was recommended to us.</review>

Another one of our favored spots at Pacific Beach for lunch... food is consistently good, decent prices ( $$), they have great happy hour appetizers at the bar ($) 3p...floor Staff needs to deliver a more genuine, parsonable guest hospitality approach, after all, San Diego is full of Tourists who's first impression of our city is through its people & food.  Restrooms definitely needs improvement!  Reflects how much the establishment cares about it's customers comfort & convenience. Hopefully, they give it some serious thought. Other than that...great location right on the beach...overlooking the beautiful Pacific Ocean!☀🌊🏖< /Text>

The food is very good and some say they have the best lobster bisque in America (? I haven’t had the easy coast version so I can’t compare). This place is almost always busy so reservations are a good idea or plant yourself in the bar area - you can order food from the menu and eat in the bar instead of waiting for a table. The menu changes daily depending on the seafood in season and from breakfast to lunch to dinner. They have more than just seafood, great pastas, steak and of course a full bar. Highly recommend but during the summer a reservation is almost a must</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< GmapID>

What a nice restaurant with an incredible view of the ocean and the boardwalk. Great place to grab brunch and people watch as they pass on the boardwalk just in front of your table. The service is always friendly and the food is good. View is unbeatable!< /review>

The price. I cannot in good conscience believe that anything at this restaurant is worth wasting or ordering at the prices they charge. Maybe the kids menu but that's as close to reasonable that they get here. Artistically, World Famous deserves its title. The dishes that are placed before are worthy of prolonged appreciation and it's a shame you eventually have to eat them. The taste though, it is well below par. The ingredients sure are there but nothing was accentuated, featured, or made delicious. Especially for the price you had to pay for them. Some dishes were outright cold and undercooked, the rest were just blasé. It was a shame we had to eventually eat them. Will proudly never be going back.</Review>

<Review>I travel  lot for business and the one thing I look for is a great restaurant at the end of the day. The Californian did not disappoint and the food was quite good along with great service. This is a great place to do the daily unwind.</Review>< Pictures>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Dont waste your time!! I was really excited to try this spot, reviews were great and it was right next to the hotel I was staying at. The entire experience was awful, I should have left when we were greeted by a rude hostess. We were sat and the server walked by multiple times before the manager took our drink order.   The food took forever (there was only 12 tables sat in the entire place) and when it came to the table it was definitely not worth the wait. The "omelet" was more like a thin egg wrapped burrito, it was nasty! The pancake was rock hard and everything else was edible. Dont waste your time or money, there is much better options on the boardwalk.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<Review>This restaurant offers one of the best views of the ocean in all of Pacific Beach. It is a great place for brunch. Enjoy a mimosa while enjoying the laid back scene on the beach. This is a casual restaurant that really fits the vibe of PB. Go enjoy a few drinks and relax.</Review>< user>

This place has been around forever (although not in this location - use to be north 3-4 blocks) and has great views of the ocean. The food is very good and some say they have the best lobster bisque in America (? I haven’t had the easy coast version so I can’t compare). This place is almost always busy so reservations are a good idea or plant yourself in the bar area - you can order food from the menu and eat in the bar instead of waiting for a table. The menu changes daily depending on the seafood in season and from breakfast to lunch to dinner. They have more than just seafood, great pastas, steak and of course a full bar. Highly recommend but during the summer a reservation is almost a must</Text>

Waaay overpriced! Waitress was snobby. The ice tea came with NO ice. Only thing nice about this place is that it's close to the ocean.< /review>

The food was okay. The drinks were delicious and view amazing. Needs a bit of updated equipment but worth s visit. Waiters/Waitresses were somewhat friendly but some were grouchy. I would not return due to the service. But if you Are into drinks and a small appetizer than definitely come here<//review>

The clam chowder was decent the lobster bisque was good and the crab sliders lacked flavor for myself and my partner so we sent it back. The chocolate horchata drink was really good :)< /text>< date>

We never got out appetizers until our food was being served. They seemed to have forgotten about them until we asked!  The food was cold and was just okay! Not worth the price! I would never recommend this place.<//text>< name>

I don't recommend Sunday as they are out of several ingredients and may try to compensate with sub par substitutes without warning. (Maybe this just means that the food is always fresh?) All in all this is a great place to eat for the view and service alone.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Went to dinner two times here on our vacation.  The clam pasta was very good. So good, I ordered it both times. The first night, the two hostesses working didnt even acknowledge us for quite some time. The second night, the same two girls were working and they just stared at us and told us they were full and didnt mention the open seating in the almost empty bar.  The first night we didn't get bread with our dinner like we did the second night.  We ordered an appetizer and it came out with our dinner which wasnt ideal. The service was good though.</text>

Good food and service.
Just a bit unhappy with valet service - they only took cash, although it did not mention,  I had to walk about and pay ATM fee, and they just parked it near by, where I did not want to park due to tow away sign.</text>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>The price. I cannot in good conscience believe that anything at this restaurant is worth wasting or ordering at the prices they charge. Maybe the kids menu but that's as close to reasonable that they get here. Artistically, World Famous deserves its title. The dishes that are placed before are worthy of prolonged appreciation and it's a shame you eventually have to eat them. The taste though, it is well below par. The ingredients sure are there but nothing was accentuated, featured, or made delicious. Especially for the price you had to pay for them. Some dishes were outright cold and undercooked, the rest were just blasé. It was a shame we had to eventually eat them. Will proudly never be going back.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Great view of the ocean and the food's pretty good but if you order the Benedict make sure you let them know that you like your eggs running as Benedict's should be. My wife had to return her eggs benedict 2 times before they finally got it right and got her the runny yolks. Parking is a real b**** and expect to drive around or Park far away. This is the price you pay for eating at a restaurant with an ocean view< /Review><date>1554447045510</date>< name>

This is just a nice place to go and relax with a great view of the ocean and the beach activities.  Good food, drinks, and service.  Sits right on the beach, and it can get busy, butbits worth a boost for sure.  We go every time we are in San Diego.< /review>

First time visiting. It hit the spot after walking 1.6 miles down the beach from Mission park. Got immediate seating in the bar and had the Surf and Turf Eggs Benedict. The lobster was great and the eggs perfectly cooked. Overall, pretty nice experience and we will be back!< /review>

<gmapID>0x80dc01ee17bdf3f9:0x545f58eab788a2fe<//gmapID><Text>We had a late-night dinner here and the food was delicious. I ordered the potato-wrapped halibut and it was fresh and delicious.

The service was good, everyone was friendly and helpful.

Unfortunately, the cleanliness is typical of a restaurant on the beach in this area... Not great, but not awful, either. I was seated next to a window and the trim looked like it had been eaten/dissolved by termites or something else, and there was sawdust/dirt nearby. My chair was also wet when we arrived and our server had to wipe it off for me. The tables and linens were clean, however.

Also, the wait times for this place are pretty bad. Since it's a venue with a sunset view, anytime around dinner you should expect to wait for up to (and sometimes over) an hour. Even when we ate well past sunset (at about 8:30), we had to wait for 45 minutes for a table. The good news is that their restaurant system will send you a text message when your table is ready, so you can put your name in and then leave again.

Overall, it's a decent restaurant with great food and a great view... if you can manage to get a table!</Text>< userid>

Service was ok, the waiter was charming and friendly when he was paying attention, but it was also pretty busy so I won't hold it against them. The food was fantastic and that's all you really need to know about any restaurant.</review>

Great views and terrible service. Although we did not have a reservation we showed up to have something light and be on our way. Even the most of the place was empty we were told there was no seating and we may find a place at the bar. After hesitation we sat at the bar for maybe 10 minutes before getting greeted and offered a beverage I ordered a coffee and baileys to warm up a bit and even that was a tad disappointing. We ordered an appetizer and a soup. We waited for over 20 minutes with no refills, no food, no service. When we did finally get served the food, it was mediocre. After our week in San Diego, it’s without hesitation that I say this was our worst experience. There’s better food with better service elsewhere!< /Review>

Never had less than a really good meal here at world famous. From really good prime rib to a prime rib bits appetizer they also offer fresh seafood and the lobster tacos are very popular in addition to a great happy hour daily not to mention they are Oceanfront at the foot of Pacific Beach Drive. Pretty cool< /review>

Great service and great views of the ocean. The food and drinks hit the spot as well.

You can't beat the beautiful views of the ocean!  They're best meal is breakfast. It's reasonably priced, the service is good and what better way to start the day then with a good breakfast and a view only Mother Nature could create!</Review>

<Review>A return trip to World Famous in Pacific Beach, San Diego and I was not disappointed!  We went on Monday afternoon for their half price bar food offerings and tried all of our favorites - the wonderful lobster bisque, the melty nut crusted Brie and their various shrimp appetizers!  My mouth is watering just remembering the great meal we had.  And half price on Monday afternoons. When in PB, World Famous is a MUST!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><UserId.>110549826899699354541< /UserId.><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

It was a great time at World Famous. Their food was delicious. I hate their pork with scalloped potatoes and it was a winner. The sauce on the pork tasted a little weird though. Their desert was also good. I had the Strawberry Mango Trifle and it was heavenly. The restaurant is right next to the beach and the decor was nice. It looked nice inside. The service was good and quick. They were helpful. The worse part was the parking. It's hard to park there and it gets really popular at around 5:30 PM. We had valet parking though.<//review>

View of the ocean is fabulous. The shrimp tacos were very tasty, and the fish and chips were perfect. They do beer batter fish and chips, which as a fish and chips snob, is the only way too make them. The service was excellent! We had a great overall experience. We will return.< /Text>

Terrible service, it was busy but still very poor service. Food was ok at best and the main dishes were quite poor quality. It felt like more of a loud pub atmosphere not a great place for families or a nice dinner. Way over priced for what you get. Quite run down facility. A disappointing experience. Stay away unless you want to be let down.< /Text>

It has potential, being right up close to shore with ocean views... but kinda needs a remodel, in my opinion. Locals love the menu for its shrimp and lobster tacos, but all the tacos are good. Great menu options. Also a widely known secret by now, the drink people know as a 'Two Straw'...is not on the actual menu... very good, very potent. Be careful with those babies....</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Everything we've had there has been top notch, and portions are large, so sharing makes it even more economical.
All seafood is fresh, so helps with the taste, plus the seasonings added and the preparation.
There are so many restaurants close by, yet this one always has customers coming in (good sign for those visiting to try a restaurant with steady customers). They don't take reservations, so in the evening you'll need to sign up and wait or come back within the time limit. For our group, it was a 2 hour wait. They'll text and call you when the table is ready.
Lobster bisque is very good! We order it every time we're there. Our son ordered the chicken strips kids dinner every time and it's satisfied his voracious appetite.<//Review>

Like most food in tourist zones, nothing special. We all got fish and chips, ahi salad and the burger. The burger was good, the fish and chips were a bit overdone, and the ahi salad came without the dressing and was otherwise bland.<//Review>

Good food and even better view! The food and drink offering, along with the staff, is above average but I typically only eat at World Famous if I am taking a friend or family member that is visiting SD to experience a meal with an awesome view.
Free public parking can be a pain to come by but World Famous does offer valet parking if you're not bothered by the $5+ valet fee.< /Text>

A bowl of clam chowder is actually a cup and has only a few small clam pieces and flavorless. Also had a pasta dish that came with a dried slice of bread and no butter. That dish also had very little flavor. Years ago World Famous had the best chowder and food on the beach. The prices are those of fine dining but neither the food or service warrant the cost.< /review>

View of the ocean is fabulous. The shrimp tacos were very tasty, and the fish and chips were perfect. They do beer batter fish and chips, which as a fish and chips snob, is the only way too make them. The service was excellent! We had a great overall experience. We will return.<//text>

The entire menu is great and the staff are always friendly! From start to finish, World Famous has plenty to choose from that shows why they are so famous. If you want just tacos, ask for the bar menu. I personally always make sure to get at least 1 shrimp and 1 fish taco! On top of excellent food that has drawn people from around the world (this last visit, we ran into someone from Cuba that had been told it was a must), the view is also nice. Right by the beach, sunset is a beautiful accompaniment to an overall great experience.</review>

<Review>Great view of the ocean and the food's pretty good but if you order the Benedict make sure you let them know that you like your eggs running as Benedict's should be. My wife had to return her eggs benedict 2 times before they finally got it right and got her the runny yolks. Parking is a real b**** and expect to drive around or Park far away. This is the price you pay for eating at a restaurant with an ocean view</Review>< pics>

Ordered a shrimp taco, a lobster taco, and a beer. The place was busy, but the food came relatively fast. I received a shrimp taco and a calamari taco. Both were ok. The toppings were overpowering the fried seafood. It was an ok experience, nothing to complain about, but I won't be suggesting this place to anyone< /text>

Breakfast was OK; nothing outstanding except for the dynamite location right on the beach.  The potatoes were somewhat overcooked.  Fruit was firm but not real sweet, but it's January, not exactly the best time of year for fresh fruit.  Omelette and eggs were good.  Bacon looked a lot better than it tasted.<//text>

Service was slow for the amount of empty tables at the time. The lobster tacos were good but the beans were bland and had some that weren't fully cooked. Probably wouldn't go here again for the food but would for the spirited cold brews. Those were 👌.<//Text>

Have been coming here for 10 years plus! Tonight's dinner was absolutely disappointing! The service was bad, food was bad! I had potato crusted sea bass.  The sea bass was microscopic & was covered with hash browns! My husband and two friends had the prime rib.  It was tough and chewy! It used to melt in your mouth! The bathrooms looked like the homeless had been living in them! How sad! Why do great places have to go down hill? Will never go there again!!! What a bummer!😢< /text>

Breakfast was OK; nothing outstanding except for the dynamite location right on the beach.  The potatoes were somewhat overcooked.  Fruit was firm but not real sweet, but it's January, not exactly the best time of year for fresh fruit.  Omelette and eggs were good.  Bacon looked a lot better than it tasted.<//text>

Great food, drinks, service, views and portion size. The best part (besides being right on the water) is the valet parking! Need parking? No problem, just drive up to the door and get out LOL</Review>

What have happened to worlds famous? It was one of the best restaurants in mission beach. A mandatory stop in each of my visits to San Diego. The food quality as decrease substantially. I would rate it now as a pricy restaurant with average quality.<//Review>

Excellent boardwalk based location.  Drinks were quick, bloody Mary was different tasting, but in a good way. Carnitas chilaquiles were plentiful, but just the right amount of food to fill me up plus it was delicious.<//Review>

Right on the beach. This is an excellent seafood soot with prices ranging from $20 to $30 per person. Each plate we had was excellent. Busy so expect a wait. Outdoor seating is feet from the ocean And beach.</Review>

This place has been great for 20 years.  Prices for Sunday brunch we're unexpectedly low $14-17 for most Benedict's, omlettes, etc including those with lobster served with a view of the ocean and boardwalk.  The preparations were excellent with generous portions and excellent flavor.< /review>

The perfect place to have cocktails a delicious breakfast or a nice dinner.

Your meal is created from scratch with fresh ingredients. Takes a little more time but enjoy the view of the surf and sip on your drink. If you cant wait hit jack-in-the-box.

Being a chef I really appreciate a creative but simple approach to there menu.

Bravo!<//text>

<Review>Outstanding food and drink.  Staff were very attentive.  Right on the beach.  Ask to sit on the patio.  Wonderful experience but don't forget to make reservations.  Come here every time I'm in  San Diego.<//Review><Rate>5</Rate><user_id>101751784724704995745<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x80dc01ee17bdf3f9:0x545f58eab788a2fe<//Gmap_id>< name>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>Great service. And the food was excellent. Nice experience along the shore and beach. The indoor atmosphere could use a little clean up and freshening since its a little smelly and dining furniture is very patio like for the fine dining prices and food. However,  one bite of those crabcakes and you know you are in the right place. I will choose this one over del Coronado any day.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dc01ee17bdf3f9:0x545f58eab788a2fe</gmapID></record>

<review>Friendly and fast service.  They gave us a seat by the windows, overlooking the beach, so we could keep an eye on our bikes.
The fish and chips were good, not greasy and much more fish than batter.
The lobster bisque was OK,  it needed more cream, more lobster and less thickener (cornstarch?)
The iced tea was exceptionally weak that day.
The pricing was fair, especially for a place right on the beach.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Great place. Looking for a place with good fish & found this place on the beach. Reasonably priced & food was amazing.  The creamy balsamic they make on site is sooooo good!! We got fish tacos which were great. But the shrimp tacos were the best.  My one son got the burger which was great!</review>

<review>The individual that greeted us was a guy who was at best brisk and at worst moderately rude. He did seat us quickly and the seating was quite nice. His manner was horrible.

Food was good not great clam chowder was exceptionally disappointing few clams lot of Chile lot of vegetables but again not very many clams. Our server was excellent Katrina I think was her name. She did well. A great job.

That's my personal opinion my wife also.< /review><gmap_id>0x80dc01ee17bdf3f9:0x545f58eab788a2fe< /gmap_id>< name>

Not only was the food amazing....and so was the sunset view.....and the price was extremely reasonable, but the BEST part was our waitress, Ali! She was amazing, knew about Gluten free items and how to handle them! Have come here for many years for breakfast.... Bummed I haven't come sooner for dinner! Thank you, Ali, you made our celebration even better!</review>

Went there Saturday evening for a relaxing sunset dinner with my wife. We waited 15 minutes and were seated. Then the hostess returned and told us this was another party's table. We were told to wait again. When we were seated for dinner, we tried to have a nice conversation and relax. It was so noisy in there I couldn't hear my wife talking. My wife enjoyed her food and tried to make the best of the evening. This was about as relaxing as eating in auto repair shop.< /text>

<Text>17 years I've gone to World Famous infrequently. The bar service has always been the same, excellent. Drinks and prime rib bites are the way to go.
If its busy, waiting for a table can take a bit, however the view is very nice.</Text><time>1508257088550<//time><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dc01ee17bdf3f9:0x545f58eab788a2fe< /gmapID>< user>

<review>I really like this place, it's right by the beach. Food isn't amazing but it's good. They have good drinks and they have a parking lot you can get validated with.

I like the atmosphere here and that's right next to the beach in PB. Parking also helps because sometimes it's impossible to find anything here.<//review>< Pics>

They do serve other meals there as well and based off of the breakfast I’m sure they are great. The food is really good, the staff is always friendly and courteous, and the people watching and view is great. Ask for a table on the patio and you might even catch a glimpse of Slo-mo blading by! The only drawback is parking can be tough. You can valet for a nominal fee or park in the garage which they will validate for 3 hours! I alway park a block or two away, because I always take a walk down the boardwalk after eating anyways. Certainly worth the trip, you will not be disappointed. Prime rib hash, or Lobster Benedict come highly recommended.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Good location and friendly service. The food was not as impressive as I had hoped. I had the lobster bennidect and my wife had the crab cake sliders, neither was all that great. Being right on the beach was a huge plus but only three stars worth in my opinion</text>

< review>
I had the Jalapeno Rib Eye, and the jalapeno butter was delicious.  I loved that it came out on a skillet, and teh vegetables were excellent.  The potatoes left something to be desired, but there was enough food on my plate.  I think I would have preferred a twice baked potato or something similar (it would have paired better).  The location is fun, they did make us wait for a really long time even though there were visibly open tables.  I felt like they were pushing for us to eat at the bar (to increase bar sales?).  Regardless the food was decent, but it's not somewhere I would go again.  The steak cut itself was not Prime, and for the cost it should have been; it was likely choice grade would be my guess.  Also I am not sure it was truly a rib eye based on the lack of marbling and very little fat.<//review>

Outstanding location for a restaurant - right on the beach. Ordered the prime rib and asked for an end cut. Let down on the taste - not very flavorful for what should have a lot of spice. Scalloped potatoes were excellent. Spinach was left out of seasoning.

We walked up without reservations and were told it would be 35 minutes and they would text us. Understandable for a Friday night except there were many open tables (reservations?). The hostess did suggest sitting at the bar which we did not.

After almost an hour we came back from a beach walk and they "allowed" us the next table that was being cleared. Not really sure if they forgot about us or just need a better process.

The service could use an adjustment and food could be higher end for the prices they charge. Probably won't go back.< /text>

Let me start by saying the food was outstanding. Best on my vacation. Although, the staff and service was poor. Our server, Charlotte, was awful. And the prices were high, compared to other close by restaurants. That will keep me from returning in the future.<//review>

We went for lobster tacos. They were awesome. I ordered a bloody Mary that wasn't very good. Their bloody Mary drinks used to be excellent. Not this time. My girlfriend ordered a mojito that was so bland that she was going to send it back, but our server didn't check on us for 15 min so she drank it.

Basically the food was awesome, the drinks were mediocre, and the service was pathetic.< /Text>

The food was good.  Service great and you certainly can't beat the view.  I would go there again for the view alone.</text>

Prime rib not informed out of au jus
So put on some Demi glaze they handed me out of chicken after ordered
Told us no chicken lol this was Friday nite at 630pm I really doubt if we will return time to try a new spot<//Text>

Mondays are half off bar appetizers from 6 to 11pm. Oysters were lousy. Mushroom crabs were oily. Tiger prawns is good and lobster tails are great. Wouldn't recommend unless you got no where else to go. Only went there cos we stayed right next door at surfer beach hotel.<//Text><gmapID>0x80dc01ee17bdf3f9:0x545f58eab788a2fe< /gmapID>< resp>

We stumbled across this place while driving down the road there. We saw the building full of Christmas tree lights strewn throughout the space so we had to stop and check out what it was all about. We just stopped in and ordered a pineapple hard cider and the workers were very nice and let us sit at a normal dinner table since the bar area was completely full.</text>

Been here multiple times and it never fails that they are always super packed. The days were I plan ahead and get there super early for breakfast or on those lazy afternoon brunch moments world famous has crowds of people waiting to be seated from thirty to an hour and fifteen minutes. Luckily in this visit we arrived at 12:50pm, we're told it would be an hour and a half but were seated in 25 minutes. Good thing we were patient. We each had the lobster Benedict and it was yummy. Hollandase with asparagus and lemon mix with potatoes was just what we were craving. The portion seemed decent but once you get closer to devouring half you realize wait I'm getting pretty full already. On top of our tasty meal, the service was great. Our waitress was very attentive - no sugar she brings more; coffee half full she brings more; and was updating us on the status of our meal while it was being cooked ensuing us "I didn't forget you." always a nice brunch here. Oh and of course request to sit in the patio to take in the awesome view of the beach.< /text>

<text>Do not come here!

Came here with a group of girls yesterday for brunch.  I ordered an Irish coffee with baileys (which is standard for an Irish coffee to already have) and was charged for 2 drinks. The waitress called over the manager when I inquired about the charge, who was ready to go into fight mode - so unprofessional, not how you treat paying customers.

Take your money somewhere else where they treat you like a customer< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Great, fast service. Had the lobster BLT and it was very good, fresh roll and the coleslaw on the side was some of the best I had. My mom had the fish and chips which she devoured and also said was amazing.  Restaurant was a little loud so not much for ambiance, but food made up for it<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>One of my favorites in San Diego! The nut crusted brie appetizer is something to dream about. The lobster tacos (on special wednesdays) are a steal. Overall, this place is great- location, food, and service.< /review>< pictures>

<review>Great food, beautiful views! Located right on the beach boardwalk in Mission Beach, about a mile walk from the Roller Coaster. Gets busy and has long wait for table at mealtimes during busy season, but great food, drinks and service make it worthwhile. Families welcome.< /review>< rating>

<text>Came for the lobster taco special and I was not impressed. The prices went up and the quality went down a whole lot from what I ever remembered. The reason I have it two stars was the location. But my friend ordered the chicken Cesar salad and even that was disappointing. On both plates the meats were chewy and bland. I was embarrassed because I had talked this place up and it did not meet my old expectations.</text>< pics>

< Review>
Order was messed up. Service was slow. Manager said an item would be removed from the bill since they messed it up and it was marked down to 50% instead of being removed. Took forever to get our waitress to take our order, an hour to get food, and 45 minutes to get the bill. What should have been an hour and a half experience turned into a 4-hour disaster. A large party, just like mine, was seated afrer us, got their food before us, their bill and were gone before us. Then another large party after they left were seated, food given and they were almost finished by the time we got our bill -after asking for it not once but twice! Food was cold or luke warm at best when we finaaly got our plates. Tasty but cold. Overall, I would not recommend this establishment< /Review>

<text>I have been to this restaurant many times, always a great time! From the food, ambiance, staff and location right on the water you can't go wrong.

My last experience was worth writing a yelp review of. It was a Thursday night and the restaurant was decently packed so we opted to seat ourselves in the bar section. We were greeted right away with water and menus by a very friendly waitress who also had some great suggestions of food. We ended up getting pollo asada tacos (which are on special every Thursday for only a dollar) which was one of the best tacos I've ever had. We also ordered the Nut encrusted Brie cheese that came with cheesy bread which was orgasmic. The only downside about the meal was ordering the jumbo Thai shrimp, it was over priced and the sauce it was served with was cold.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.< /text><response>None<//response><time>1505269436880</time><userid>104345905733681135663<//userid></record>

We got a simple bacon and eggs plate. The bacon was burnt to the point of it being inedible, the waitress was rude, and she forgot part of our order even though she wrote it down. Probably the worst restaurant experience Ive had</text>

waitress was very pleasant and accommodating when we added one person to our already party of 4.  sat on the boardwalk with views of ocean and passerbys.  it was a Sat morning and kitchen was swamped.  our dishes showed evidence of rushed preparedness.  would go back.  plan on parking in the neighborhood across the street or pay for valet.</Text>

<Text>Came for the lobster taco special and I was not impressed. The prices went up and the quality went down a whole lot from what I ever remembered. The reason I have it two stars was the location. But my friend ordered the chicken Cesar salad and even that was disappointing. On both plates the meats were chewy and bland. I was embarrassed because I had talked this place up and it did not meet my old expectations.</Text>< Pics>

<text>Terrible, expensive food, great view.  I ordered red snapper (not fresh) which tasted fishy and spongy. The waitress recommended it claiming it to be her "favorite". The side dishes were just as bad. This is my 2nd visit, and both times the food was horrible. The tables and chairs were in poor condition and not what you would expect for the prices.< /text><user_name>Ken Conrad<//user_name>< UserId.>

<text>We sat at the bar an ordered a bunch of appys. Good food and the rib happy hour deal was quite a value. On the other hand, my old fashioned coat more here than at the hotel bar! Our server was great but it was very busy and she was a little overwhelmed so we didn't get things quickly. Not her fault but maybe they should reevaluate their staffing needs. We really enjoyed the calamari. It came out in nice big sticks that weren't overcooked as a lot of places tend to do. Of course the location and accompanying sunset were sweet!<//text>< Gmap_id>

Delicious food and great service.
Steph was the epitome of hospitality and service.
Great setting and atmosphere.
Not too formal, yet not casual either- pleasant.</Text>

I've always had great experiences here when I come into town. The lobster bisque is my favorite item on the menu. As for meals, I've always enjoyed the cajan pasta and the potato wrapped sea bass. If you're not a fish fan, the spicy filet mignon is amazing as well. On a side note, if you're enjoy people watching, this is also a fun place as you can see all kinds of different personalities of people passing by on the beachfront.</text>

A fantastic place on the beach to enjoy Breakfest , lunch or dinner.
The view is incredible !
The food was amazing .
We had breakfest there. I had eggs Benedict that were near perfect .
We came back for lunch the next day and were not dissapointed.
Enjoy this litle gem .<//review>

waitress was very pleasant and accommodating when we added one person to our already party of 4.  sat on the boardwalk with views of ocean and passerbys.  it was a Sat morning and kitchen was swamped.  our dishes showed evidence of rushed preparedness.  would go back.  plan on parking in the neighborhood across the street or pay for valet.</review>

<Review>The service was friendly and prompt. We started with seared scallops and potato pancakes with lemon emulsion. Very good!

We had red snapper and salmon/shrimp/scallop/harpoon combo. The harpoon combo was very good. However, the Vera Cruz Red Snapper had too many hot peppers which made it a bit too spicy and almost ruined the dish. I had to pick out the hot peppers to enjoy it. Less hot peppers and a bit more salt instead was needed. Next time, I will pass on the Vera Cruz.

We also had dessert. Key lime cheese cake and creame brûlée. Both were awesome! Overall, we had a very nice dinner.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<text>Visitors, this is a MUST!
My adult son & I ended up here on a Sunday, because there was a huge line at Woody's. We were not disappointed. Brunch is huge, Mimosas yummy, view was amazing and Servers are above & beyond Nice & efficient!💜

Take Bus 8 from Old Town Transit, to Pacific Beach Drive, go thru parking strip to Ocean. U R there.

Catamaran Hotel is across the street (Mission Blvd). If you walk thru this hotel, you will come out on the beautiful BAY!😎</text></record></dataset><record>

Love coming here for brunch! Beautiful ocean views, great food, and great cocktails. I had a mermaid cocktail here with Serrano Chilis and that was probably my favorite. On my most recent visit, I had the pozole, which was AMAZING!< /review>

First time. Location. Location. Location. Menu choices and execution very adequate with commenserate pricing. Service fast and friend ly. Take out as expected, but not exceptional. Table setting and atmosphere would not rate "word famous". Parking inadequate; especially for handicap.</Review>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>I ordered 3 tacos, but I ended up being pretty full and only ate one. I didn't even touch the other two, so I asked for a togo box. I was told that I couldn't get a togo box because my food was bought during happy hour with a discount. I ended up having to leave two whole, untouched tacos, which were most likely thrown away by the waitress. What a waste of both food and money. Combined with other people's uneaten food, we threw away 5 whole tacos, which could have been someone's meal.
When we asked for our checks, we were told that it couldn't  be split, which would have been fine, except that the only reason was because happy hour checks couldn't be split.
The food was just average and their policies were illogical. I already paid for my food. If i need to pay an extra dollar for a togo box, I can pay for the box if it means not throwing away a wasted meal.</text><date>1555873946307< /date>< username>

< Review>
We went to World Famous for breakfast .  The restaurant was not busy but it still took 10 minutes before our server came to get our drink order.  By that time we knew what we wanted to eat so we ordered our meals and a to-go order.  After another 10 minutes we still didnt have our drinks so my husband went to the bar to get our drinks (2 bottles beers). Service continued to be slow.  We got our bill and the to go order wasnt on the tab.  The waitress said sorry she forgot and that she would but a rush order in for it.  Boo! Over all the food is fine the view is great and the service is subpar at best.< /Review>

<Text>From appetizer to dessert, World Famous was truly the most sensational dining experience of my entire life. The service was incredibly exceptional, and the flavor in each morsel of food to bless my tastebuds was phenomenal. The craftsmanship behind every bite was clearly evident, and I applaud the passion of the seemingly miraculous chefs in the kitchen. I live in the Midwest, and I am already planning a return visit to San Diego to specifically enjoy another meal at this utterly spectacular restaurant. I have recently had the opportunity to dine at one of the most highly regarded restaurants in Chicago, and after the first bite of my entree, my thoughts were, "This is nowhere near as good as World Famous". World Famous: if I ever become rich and famous, you can count on a shoutout from me in my Oscar acceptance speech. I hope one day in my future a dining experience can coexist beside you, but for now, you take the lead.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Eric, the manager on duty was excellent!  I wasn't even there because I couldn't be.  It is my Dads 60th birthday and happens to bet there for a conference on his birthday!   I called Eric explained my brother and I couldn't be there on our Dads special day...... I wrote a quick birthday rendition and Eric had his dream team pull it off!  How personal and what a memory!  Couldn't have done it without Eric and his team!  Thank you so much for making my Dad's 60th one to remember!   My parents text me with a photo of the cake!  They loved it!  Priceless!  Thanks Eric and his wonderful team!</Review>

This is the worst seafood I have had.  The presentation and freshness was on par with what I'd expect from Dennys.  Tasted microwaved.  Even the rice was crunchy.< /review>

<Text>We went to World Famous for breakfast .  The restaurant was not busy but it still took 10 minutes before our server came to get our drink order.  By that time we knew what we wanted to eat so we ordered our meals and a to-go order.  After another 10 minutes we still didnt have our drinks so my husband went to the bar to get our drinks (2 bottles beers). Service continued to be slow.  We got our bill and the to go order wasnt on the tab.  The waitress said sorry she forgot and that she would but a rush order in for it.  Boo! Over all the food is fine the view is great and the service is subpar at best.</Text>< time>

Bloody Mary's were amazing! Although, i wouldn't recommend bringing children.  The staff made it obvious we were not welcome. Also, there was a female waitress with brown hair and big glasses that was extremely rude to my husband and our 5 month old baby girl. Think angry 16 year old, snooty ex-girlfriend mentality, that made him feel like a jack ass for helping himself to a table, with our infant, after standing there for 10 minutes, looking at 15 empty tables, while she was on her ass nowhere to be found to seat us. #1 rule of customer service: help your customers! And sure as hell don't talk down to them when they did your job for you.  By the way, we were here at 3 pm... normal time to bring kids to a reataurant.

Here's a gold star World-Famous, for your amazing bloody Mary's. And heres a cookie for you, angry honey-boo boo 😘</text>

<review>I've gone here for years, it was a fantastic restaurant.  It's changed, I think the view keeps this place open now.

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>From appetizer to dessert, World Famous was truly the most sensational dining experience of my entire life. The service was incredibly exceptional, and the flavor in each morsel of food to bless my tastebuds was phenomenal. The craftsmanship behind every bite was clearly evident, and I applaud the passion of the seemingly miraculous chefs in the kitchen. I live in the Midwest, and I am already planning a return visit to San Diego to specifically enjoy another meal at this utterly spectacular restaurant. I have recently had the opportunity to dine at one of the most highly regarded restaurants in Chicago, and after the first bite of my entree, my thoughts were, "This is nowhere near as good as World Famous". World Famous: if I ever become rich and famous, you can count on a shoutout from me in my Oscar acceptance speech. I hope one day in my future a dining experience can coexist beside you, but for now, you take the lead.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Outstanding restaurant. Always make it here for breakfast/brunch when we are in San Diego, or even anywhere close... will drive down from 30-40 miles up the coast in Carlsbad. Their lobster benedict is my favorite. Hollandaise sauce is bright and citrusy, not heavy like many others. And they have a pomegranate mimosa that is unique and delicious. Highly recommend!!!< /review>< pics>

Come here for the view and some fish.  Kinda pricy not amazing food, but is still better than most. Serve staff are really friendly.  Due to the location, time your meal before or after swarm meal times of tourists.< /Text>

I have always had such great food/service here but my most recent visit was a pretty big let down.  We had a girls brunch (6 of us) and made reservations at 11 am.  Everyone was seated by 11:05 and it took at least 30 minutes for them to bring out waters and our first round of drinks.   They also only gave us breakfast menus which I though was strange since the table right next to us had the brunch menu.  The food was just ok, I  had the lobster benny and the sauce was pretty flavorless.  I will for sure be back, I'm just hoping this was a off day.</text>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>I ordered 3 tacos, but I ended up being pretty full and only ate one. I didn't even touch the other two, so I asked for a togo box. I was told that I couldn't get a togo box because my food was bought during happy hour with a discount. I ended up having to leave two whole, untouched tacos, which were most likely thrown away by the waitress. What a waste of both food and money. Combined with other people's uneaten food, we threw away 5 whole tacos, which could have been someone's meal.
When we asked for our checks, we were told that it couldn't  be split, which would have been fine, except that the only reason was because happy hour checks couldn't be split.
The food was just average and their policies were illogical. I already paid for my food. If i need to pay an extra dollar for a togo box, I can pay for the box if it means not throwing away a wasted meal.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Friendly staff, great food and beach view - what's not to love? Pozole was very good. For brunch try the carnitas choquille con huevos.</Review>

Went for breakfast. The pancakes were good, but there were these guys there putting tables together the whole time. This involved a very loud drill and guys carrying tables behind me as I ate. Also when they out the tables back in place no one wiped down or cleaned the tables. It was a little disturbing.</review>

<text>Visited for breakfast with my kids...the place was busy with a mix of tourists and locals.  We were seated comfortably and quickly.  Service was very attentive and outstanding.  Sadly, no one enjoyed their food.  The fruit served with pancakes was without flavor, and the pancakes weren't much better...the huevos rancheros was dreadful...lots of a red sauce smothering eggs and a soggy flour or corn tortilla, with refried beans on the side.  Wonderful location and delightful staff, but we won't be back.  Much better food options nearby.</text></record></dataset><record>

Fish tacos are good but what you are really paying for the amazing view, so grab a table on the sun-porch and people watch.< /text>

<review>Last year when we came here it was awesome, this year however was not so good 3 out of 4 dinners had no flavor, salt didn't help either, i guess they decided using any spices was too much trouble. Also we sat out in the enclosed area and the seats were so hard it was uncomfortable to sit thete too long.<//review><Date>1438711879807< /Date>< pics>

This place came highly recommended by a friend.
We were a party of 4 plus a baby about a year old. We were seated right away. Our waitress Kristen took 10 mins before introducing herself and we waited another 10 minutes before bringing us the bread and our drinks. I ordered an appetizer right away which was the panko shrimp. We go our drink then the shrimp came out. The plate had 3 pieces of shrimp, some lettuce, and a type of dressing that soaked the bottom of the plate. 11$ for 3 pieces of shrimp that we're smothered in a sweet Italian dressing.
Then we called for our waitress that had gone MIA and she continued to take the order of a couple that had been seated a half an hour after us and then continued to check on a table that had already received their checks for "tip talk". Then after she passed our table once again and did not acknowledge us until the other tables looked satisfied. We were there for an hour before we were able to place our order.
My mom ordered a beach burger. It was a huge disappointment!!!!!! The patty was one of those frozen ones that comes prepackaged. She didn't eat half of it.
My daughters cappenelli didn't have clams in it like we ordered so we waited another 30 minutes before they brought her out a bowl of clams to add to her dish. All the while she fed off of my plate. The whole experience was terrible!!! From the waitress to the food! Yes the view was nice but there were plenty of other restaurants that we could have enjoyed descent food at. The food is not good. I don't mind paying the high prices if we get palatable food. I had high hopes but we will not be returning to this place.<//review>

<Review>Servers said they would text me when table was free (wait time 10mins). When no text arrived after 20mins, I asked them if table was free. Same girl didn't have a clue what I was talking about and asked me if I had a reservation. We finally got seated & food was expensive but tasty. View of ocean is ok but no shade means sun blinds you and makes it too hot. It feels like a tourist trap and "World Famous" is flattering to say the least.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

sat us down immediately but took a very long time (over 20 minutes) to come back and ask for our drinks.

waitress didnt come by to check on us because it was busy and our drinks (just tea & water) were empty the whole night.

the other people near us were very rude and cussing and the employees didnt really tell them anything.

the food was really really tasty though.< /Review>

<Review>Make a reservation, otherwise you'll need to wait a long time or wait a little less and sit in the bar where the drinks were great and we were told we'd get the full menu. But we only were given the bar menu and the bar food was disappointing especially for the price.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Date>1466562261400</Date></record>

This is my favorite breakfast spot in San Diego!!! I went in to labor here and watched my husband's ship sail away for deployment on their patio... two of the most painful days of my life and yet all I can think about is the soothing and wonderful taste of the eggs benedict!  ;)</Text>

I had the dorado san jose and it was exquisite.  They were busy but we were seated quickly without reservations. I'd recommend getting them for dinner.  Staff was quick, courteous, & knowledgeable on the menu, but who cares...  Go for the food!</Text>

<Text>No longer world famous... well not in 2014 at least. Sub-par food, fish tacos come with a giant filet instead of shredded. Who wants to shove that in their mouth. Refried beans... Or beans from a can with some cheese on top?

As a professional reviewer, this place needs help. A run down decor and wait staff that looks like it spent all night playing beer bong.< /Text>< UserId.>

Place is packed. Will stick with bar food from now on. They forget to bring side back after replacing red snapper. Two different t orders neither were good.

<review>If you aren't interested in service the place is world famous for rude texting waitresses.

If it wasn't for the beach front view this place would have no chance.

Don't bother going here.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I just love this place. I come to PB specifically to stay at Surfer Beach Hotel and have lunch and breakfast here. If there are one or two people, just sit in bar area if you don't want to wait for table. Great ocean view, lobster or carne asada benedict, and killer posole! Casual attire and prices are very reasonable.<//review>< pics>

The food was good. However , if you don't order alcohol, waitresses loose interst in you and leave you with impression that you are not welcomed  there.< /text>

We started our meal with the crab cakes, which were wonderful but definitely on the small side (3 golf ball sized). Great tasting though and would absolutely order again. The caesar salad dressing was wonderful and home made. Tomatoes in the salad threw off the taste a bit but still a great salad. Lobster bisque was creamy but a bit bland but still better than many places.

The meal fell apart at the entree. We both got the filet and shrimp scampi. While shrimp was good, the filet was atrocious and covered with what could best be described as what one would put on a salisbury steak. If your filet needs any kind of gravy, your doing it wrong. The brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes also were just meh. Definitely not worth anywhere close to the almost $30 cost. I'll happily pay a mint for a great steak but this wasn't even close to mediocre.

If I were to come back, I would be much more cautious of entree or just stick with salad and appetizer.<//text>

I had the dorado san jose and it was exquisite.  They were busy but we were seated quickly without reservations. I'd recommend getting them for dinner.  Staff was quick, courteous, & knowledgeable on the menu, but who cares...  Go for the food!<//Review>

The food is perfectly adequate, but the service is barely there - to be honest you're mostly here for the unique beachside location.<//review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>World Famous Restaurant and Bar will have you coming back again and again (expect a wait for your table in the restaurant). It is one of Pacific Beach's most popular spots. World Famous is the most popular restaurant I have written about in the last 7 months (Nov2016 to July 2017).

Interesting stylish interior! The whole front area facing the ocean has large windows for great views.. they have decorated the interior with graphics, wood and steel as well as interesting lighting in main dining area. The food is good (could improve on this though) and the service is top notch. The bar is very, very popular with locals and tourists, always a busy place, but if you love crowds visit during the summer; wow!, Pacific Beach is noted for crowds and World Famous gets a high percentage of the traffic.

You dine right next to the famous PB Boardwalk (most tables have the ocean view but the patio is the best) with streams of people passing by and just beyond the Boardwalk is the gorgeous sand of PB and of course the blue, blue Pacific Ocean. This is a  great place for camera buffs because the sunsets are gorgeous from here. Just a few blocks to the north is the famous Crystal Pier which makes a great silhouette for your special photo. Note: If you are putting people in your photo remember to bump flash as you will get a much better photo for your album.

World Famous has had a very friendly atmosphere every time I have visited so you can expect to have a nice time.

Some additional info on area.

I This is a great location near other cool places that you may be interested in:

The Surfer Hotel.. Beachfront rooms and moderate pricing (same location)

The Promenade.. an eclectic mini-mall (1/2 block east)

The Catamaran.. Stylish Hotel on Mission Bay (2 blocks west)

La Haina Beach Club.. Restaurant/Bar on the sand (1/2 block north)

PB Shore Club.. Very Popular Bar/Restaurant (3 blocks north)

Pangaea Outpost.. San Diego's best artist mall (on Garnet Ave)

Crystal Pier Hotel Cottages.. San Diego's most popular pier.. complete with fishing and it's own shops. Only "Sleep Over the Ocean" Hotel in San Diego. (5 blocks north)

Garnet Ave.. Most popular street in Pacific Beach. Packed with popular bars, restaurants (all types), boutiques, thrift shops, pool room (Society Billiard Cafe), night clubs, markets and much more. (5 blocks north)

And of course there is the very popular Pacific Beach Boardwalk.. this great boardwalk extends north and south for great walks or bicycle rides. 1 mile to north is very attractive and takes you to overlook La Jolla and the beach from atop PB's north-end cliffs and beautiful Palisade Park (almost 1 mile north)...  to the south you have 2 miles of popular boardwalk that takes you through Mission Beach and finally to the jetty which has view of ocean and Ocean Beach across the channel. Also, you can cross over to the Mission Bay Boardwalk which is only 3 blocks to the east and there you can enjoy miles and miles of gorgeous bay front homes and parks that wrap around the whole man-made bay (largest in SoCal).

Hope this helps!<//review><Time>1504438111208< /Time>< gmapID>

<text>I did my first official taco tuesday a few months back with a group of friends. I thought this meant authentic mexican tacos for some reason.. but it was not the case. There was a ridiculous line and wait for taco tuesday and when we finally sat down, the service was in a disarray and we couldn't get the attention of the server for a while. Once we finally did, I ordered shrimp tacos but it came with shredded american cheese on top and I was surprised by the combo.

However, it was good. I definitely had different expectations but perhaps it was just this joint that had it american style. My friend had the chicken taco but he said it was dry. I enjoy the view of the beach while eating tacos but the ambiance is different from sitting in an ocean-view restaurant. This seemed more like a casual sit down eatery.</text>< Pics>

This place was a disappointment.  The service was poor.  My food was heavily salted and had to be returned to the kitchen.  I rarely think food has too much salt so this was ridiculous!  I assume it was the manager who appeared at our table to take reorders.  She was somewhat rude and very short with us, so I declined ordering a replacement meal.  This was the most negative experience during our vacation in San Diego.< /Text>

Well this place service sucks...we waited for almost 2 hours waiting for a table..since we were a party of eight we were told to wait..common sense ..put 2 tables together and problem solve..even a monkey can think of that..but wait I notice the front desk girls were all blonde so that's why.left that place and here is my review ..0.< /Text>

The food is very good and also plentiful. We had salad - prices are ok.

(Translated by Google) Good quality. Terrace in front of the sea, enough space between the tables. The staff very nice.
The menu is not very extensive and does not have a great variety as is the case in Europe.

(Translated by Google) Typical Californian food, excellent and very friendly service. Right by the sea, I recommend reserving a window table at 6pm to watch the sunset.
