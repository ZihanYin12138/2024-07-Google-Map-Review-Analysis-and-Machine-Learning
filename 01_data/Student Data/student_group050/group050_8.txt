<Text>Lalo was an absolute beast in fixing my rear end and front bumper. It looks like there was zero damage after the lady rear ended me. 10 star service for him is just bare minimum. Well done Lalo, Robert and the Fix Auto Downtown Staff!!< /Text><Rating>5</Rating>< userid>

Incredibly friendly and helpful. My battery had died the day before I was scheduled to bring my car in... I called Katelyn at the shop and even though they don’t necessarily provide this type maintenance service she said she’d figure it out. Great service. Great shop.<//review>

<Text>Although the repairs took longer than anticipated due to a delay in parts available, we were updated throughout the process, the staff were professional and feel that our new vehicle is new once again. With a lifetime warranty on the completed work, we have the confidence that Fix Auto Downtown went above and beyond to ensure we will be satisfied for years to come and if we need anything they are a phone call away.

<Text>Listen to the reviews on this one. Fix Auto Downtown San Diego is a busy man and works fast, but the quality is top notch. Euro Motorcars has earned their spot as my mechanic for my BMW 335i coupe with extremely high quality work, fast turnaround times and competitive pricing. My first visit was just a maintenance service, they changed the oil and brake fluid same day for less than any other shop I called.<//Text></record>

This morning, Just showed my front bumper which just down itself somehow. He told me there's nothing to do unless he'd change all parts probably thinking to show thousands dollars cost(!) cuz he explained a simple repair more complicated than it should be. I knew it would take Just 5 mins. So I went another place and bought two spacer right and left that costs 36$ and they just reinstalled the pumber in 5 mins. Thats all... thats all should have been done but they werent able to unfortunately!<//text>

<review>Great place to bring your Porsche.  Fix Auto Downtown is honest and a great guy to work with.  Big savings compared to the dealerships.  He has extensive experience from working at dealerships as well.  He said he was going to work on my car personally because it was a tricky operation and he wanted to make sure everything was good.</review>< pictures>

This place is excellent.
I took my 2020 Z4 here for it's 75k maintenance, had the entire brake system replaced, and fixed a few other problems. Service was quick, professional, and they give you a great 10% discount for paying cash.</text>

<Text>Believe the hype, Euromotorcar is the real deal. I was changing out stock lights on my new 3 series and accidentally bent the bracket that holds the bulb. I was pretty convinced I had to get a whole new light assembly. I was pretty bummed since this car is less than a month old.</Text>< Response>

I took my car in after being vandalized and they immediately took care of me.
They gave a time estimate of date completion,
Daily updates about the car,
Called you about the car and when to pick up.
When I picked my car up, they even cleaned the outside of the car and looked like a brand new car from a dealership.
I would highly suggest this place!< /Text>

This shop did amazing job!!
The whole ordeal with the accident was truly a pain but everyone at this shop went above and beyond customer service. Ellie has amazing customer service skills, she always gets back to you, follows up with all questions asked and just overall you can see she takes pride in her job. Mark the GM is great, he really helped in so many ways with this entire process, guidance through this situation was huge as myself and my girlfriend have never been in accident. Mark was able to help speed the process up, get our car broken down and gave an accurate estimate of damages. Our car was totaled and most shops would have written you off at that point,  realizing they wouldn’t be doing any further work. Mark didn’t stop and even helped us find a salvage yard and made the process of having to get rid of the car extremely easy after 6 weeks of dealing with this all the fix auto team and Mark did amazing job to ensure this all ended smoothly for us.

Thank you
To the TEAM at downtown Fix Auto<//Review>

I was in a time crunch to get a tow hitch removed from my Ford. I was able to get an appointment the next morning when then. When I dropped off my car, I asked for an estimate. They quickly checked out the hitch and said leave us a good review and wellw have it done by end of day. They were very friendly and understanding and kept to their word. Highly recommend!<//Text>

<Review>the folks here did good work fixing and replacing the rear bumper on our car. looks like new and looks like nothing happened. oh, this place opens up at 8:00 am. so its big garage door is closed until 8:00 am. if you get there too early, you'll be circling around looking for metered parking out on the street. good luck!<//Review>< time>

They were extremely helpful and really kind to me! The whole process of getting an estimate is definitely inconvenient for anyone with a busy schedule. They were accommodating with my time, made it easy for me to get a morning appointment before work, and let me drop it off early because I arrived before my appointment. The estimate they gave me was EXTREMELY fair, and I would feel comfortable paying it without insurance. Definitely going to recommend this place to any of my friends who need fixes.< /text>

<user_name>D</user_name><Review>Was in a rear end accident. Took my car here on a referral from nationwide insurance. They were helpful in getting me in  as quickly as they did. The issue was that I was quoted 4 to 5 days and I would be out the door. It took more than double the time to get the repair done.

I let them know upon dropping off that there was a creaking coming from the rear end suspension. They told me that they would fix my trunk and bumper THEN drive the car to see of it was fixed.

I'm not a mechanic but that doesn't make any logical sense at all. It would make sense to inspect the car, test drive and give a proper diagnosis and repair program.

I got my car back and as I was driving off the noise was still there. I called 3x to finally get in touch with the manager who scheduled a day for me to come in. I was contacted asking to change my date because he had some sort of emergency. I get that. I never received a follow up call which was disappointing. As a result, I decided to just move on.

I will get it looked at. I took my car to another place to reveal there is in fact damage. I called nationwide to let them know but they are hesitant to open the claim unless I returned to Fix Auto.

At this point I'm hesitant to return to FIX. Not sure why I should be inconvenienced when they could have completed the job the right way the first time. Laziness is not an excuse for an SOP.

They get 2 solid stars for the work they did do. U know... pop on a trunk and paint it. I should have taken my audi elsewhere.<//Review>< rating>

<Review>Promised to touch up peeled paint - didn’t.
Called twice to arrange interior detailing with a partner company - didn’t.
These bothersome ‘update texts’ ...they are automatically generated and mine was off by nearly two days. ‘They are not texted to you by a caring mechanic’ - it’s on autopilot as soon as you hand over your keys. 🙄< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I would like to thanks this shop because they were able to get fixed my car soon and it was a really good job they have done.  I am a believer that I do not have to write to long review in order to express my feeling and how happy I am with this shop, for sure I will come back and I invite you to visit them and experience them.</text>

Spoke to Jorge at Alden Farris, who went the extra mile, obtained supplemental payments and obtained quality Nissan parts on my car. They kept me posted on the progress and delivered my car fully detailed! Honestly, it looked better than when I bought it- fantastic work done by professionals. I had the same experience a few years ago when my wife's car was repaired. Way to go, guys!</Review><Time>1436572392007< /Time><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>While on a business trip to San Diego I had my driver side window come off the tracks while full open.  Because I had a six hour return trip ahead of me, I needed it fixed.  I found Alden Farris on Yelp (I am giving them five stars there too), drove in at 8 a.m. and Jorge got me in right away.  90 minutes later the window was secure, the car was ready and they charged me a fair price.  Excellent service, obviously experienced.  My experience - excellent.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Called asked for pricing on bathing a Rottweiler. They asked how old  answered 9yrs aggressive I said maybe around other dogs. This is her first time with a pet groomer. Just want to see what being groomed at pet facility is like. They said they don’t due Rottweilers there. Because they don’t like to be away from there owners for to long. So they suggested I go to a do it yourself car wash. Find the pet attachment piece and wash her there. Never heard of it.... don’t know if this is right, and Rottweilers get treated this way.  But wow what a experience. I just wanted my dog to feel what being groomed by a professional is like.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dcd6228dae1ad9:0xd5b7f27f33c9e06d</GmapID>< user_name>

<review>Great neighborhood pet groomers. Our dog gets really nervous at groomers, and he's been rejected from other places or treated with annoyance. Discount pets didn't even hesitate taking our dog in, and were so nice and welcoming. Bonus, they speak Spanish! Great place, and of course their prices just add to how great it is!<//review>< Pics>

We found a lost dog and after being able to verify that the owners were unable to take her back in we decided to keep her. The people at this establishment were the kindest and most accommodating people we have ever met. They completely transformed  a mop headed lil dog into the cutest sweetest looking baby ever! 10/10 absolutely amazing and we will definitely return< /Text>

Expensive price for a mediocre service got quoted 45 bucks for a complete service and ended up paying 65 bucks my dog is an inside dog and hair is brushed twice a week he wasn't extremely dirty .I also made a 10am appoiment and received my dog until 4pm I understand it gets busy and I dont expect my dog ready in 1 hour BUT 6 hours is a bit excessive.
I spoke to a customer while I waited and they charged her 25 bucks over her intital quote. I told my GF about this experience and she said they did the same thing to her a couple years ago she gave them the benefit of the doubt and went a couple more times and everytime it was way over the quoted price she didnt know thats where i was taking my dog she would've saved me the trouble. I will NOT give them the benefit of the doubt.  Seems like its a trend to get you in the door. Quotes should be close to the final price not 20+ bucks off the quote consistently and not take 6 hrs with an appoiment.</text>

I really don’t know what’s going on with this place. My dog had a 1030 appointment. And didn’t get to finish until 345. Once we picked her up she was dragging her butt which wasn’t normal. Then her haircut wasn’t right. They cut her a couple times on her legs. If you ever bring your dog to this place to get cut please ask for the older lady to cut it< /text>

I brought my dog to get a regular groom and to cut her nails when I drop her off she was in perfect conditions after I pick her up she was drowning up and pooping blood her rectum was super swallow not sure what they did to my poor dog. I had to take her to  the emergency.I call the owner to fine out what happen at the time I drop off my dog and they took for ever to return my call and one of the guys responded to me that it was normal for my dog to be pooping blood after a groom? I really don’t recommend this place. I hope that nothing serious is going on with my dog<//text>

They are always happy when they return. Love that they are a mom and pop. Love that is family run. Just love this place!!! They really love and care about the dogs.</Review>< resp>

< review>
Before you go here read all of the reviews even on yelp, you will find many people complain about their dog's eyes burning ( My dog's eyes totally red both of them completely red like he had red contacts on) from the junk shampoo they use.  They pass it off as an allergic reaction but my dog is 15 years old and I just use whatever shampoo is off the store shelf and so did my groomer until she retired so it's not an "allergic reaction" try putting some Irish Spring soap in your eyes next time you take a shower let me know if you think that feels like an allergic reaction.</review>

I haven't even brought my puppy here yet but Jamise was so friendly and  we talked for 10 minutes about pomeranian's and how loving and delicate they are and I just felt like she related to me.  She made me feel very confident to bring my puppy there tomorrow.  She's also a walk away so that will make it very convenient moving forward!
Can't wait to see the final results tomorrow and write another review.  I love supporting local businesses especially during this time!</Text>

Great place to take your dog 🐕 for a bath and some groomimg. Aka getting spoiled. Lol. My first time here. Saw the reviews and thought I'd try it out. I was concerned about taking my dog here during this pandemic we're in. But it all worked out as they got everything coordinated to ensure both employee and customer safety.</Text>

Can not erase my previous review (can only edit & change star rating) but we’ve resolved issues from our initial interaction. Since then, service has always been A1 when we need it. Haven’t been able to find a more convenient, cost effective, professional grooming service since. Sometimes bumpy roads lead to rainbows.  Thanks for your service and willingness to stay open for the community during this unpredictable pandemic. Fur babies need love too.

Called in today at 3:50 PM to see if my pet could come in for a quick grooming. A rude male representative RUDELY stated that they close at 4 PM and hung up in my face. Called back to state that their website and google clearly state they close at 5PM Friday and Saturday (see pics). The female representative was also rude and then exclaimed they’d have to update the website. Mind you, I’d been here before on a Friday AFTER 4 PM. *cue eye rolling * Regardless of if they recently changed the hours or not, they didn’t gave to be unpleasantly rude about it. I hope the female wasn’t the jolly one I’d dealt with before. All respect lost & probably my business. On Yelp the business owner stated what the signs said in their lobby but again I’ve been serviced after that time so *cue eye rolling again *.</Review>

Our Website, as well as sign in front lobby clearly state Walk-ins end at 2pm. If you need something later in the afternoon you have to make an appointment at least 24hours in advance. A good, safe grooming session takes an hour half which is why we cut off walk-ins at 2pm. Also we’ve never spoken to you, only your husband, who has made appointment for tomorrow morning at 9am. Look forward to servicing all your pups needs in the morning. Happy Holidays.'}</resp><gmap_id>0x80dcd6228dae1ad9:0xd5b7f27f33c9e06d< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Thanks so much for giving Daisy, our Maltipoo baby, a great shave despite that she was already rejected by PetSmart due to her serious matted fur condition.  She's looking gorgeous, cute, and very soft now.  I would definitely come back and refer your great service to family and friends.<//review>< name>

They did an amazing job with our fur kid! After having a baby our fur kid Zoe was in need of a makeover. When my husband brought her home my 4 year old kept saying how cute she looked! If I could give it 10 stars I would! Thank you 🙏<//Review>

<Review>DO NOT TAKE YOUR DOG HERE!!

I brought my dog here because it was affordable but THEY DID THE POOREST JOB EVER!

His coat was cut uneven and patchy
His nails were cut till he bled
His chest was very uneven
His tail was still matted
He still had dirt around his mouth

SMFH!!

This groomer was a God send. The staff consist of a lovely family. The owner is a sweet woman. They handle the dogs with love, care, and patience. They are so reasonable. $25 for a standard cut. I have 3 dogs so this is very helpful. You have to dry it. I looooooove this place.< /Review>

My little boy is not the easiest dog to groom, yet the ladies here managed to leave him looking like a STUD! They were beyond gentle and patient with him, and you can tell they are true animal lovers.<//Review>

< Review>
Took my long hair Chihuahua today. She was shakey (first time being groomed and etc) when I went to pick her up she was happy and calm not shakey anymore. Im guessing she had a great expierence. She smelled nice and her hair was great (hair cut) looked like a little lion. (First picture u can see hair cut and 2nd pic of her face was b4 with long hair)she will be fresh and not shedding so she will be able to be inside now!< /Review>

<Text>Funny little place in a sketchy little area. Four stars cause they did a great job with my dog's cut at a pretty low price, but the location isn't great. It's a little place behind barred doors and the employees working were all communicative, but all seemed pretty young. Hope they're getting paid well because it looks like a tough and busy work environment! The girl who cut my dog's hair was nice. Just kind of a hectic and strange smelling place.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I didn't  like the hair cut they did on my pet. The tail and the ears hair wouldn't match the rest of the hair cut. The place is so little and hot. Is economic but I wouldn't go again!<//review>

So the other day I brought in my 2 pups to get their nails trimmed and ears cleaned since I bathed them at home. Well they hate getting their nails cut and I was struggling getting one to walk in, out of a nowhere a dog dashed out their door and I’m shouted at for not closing the door immediately. Um how am I suppose to close the door if my dog hadn’t even walked in yet!?! Anyways needless to say I didn’t let them cut my babies nails and tried to put the whole scene behind me. Come to find out I received a phone call apologizing, offering a complimentary bath & nail trimming BUT if I could meet with the owners of the dog that ran out of their shop. The whole thing sounded sketchy so I politely declined their offer. Low prices/free services don’t mean good service.</text>

Took my dog for a simple wash for some reason they cut his nails also I didn’t ask for that because he had already got them cut about two weeks ago unfortunately they cut them too short when I picked up my dog he was bleeding profusely all over their floor all over my and truck  until I got him home to put some super glue on his nail the guy also told me it would be about 40 minutes When I came back my dog was still in the same place and he told me it would be another 10 then  he hurried and washed him.</Review>

A couple of other reviews pointed out that your dog is in a crate/cage while they wait for you. Any groomer I have used does the same. What other groomers don't do is take the time to get to know your pet and ask questions about them. They also don't show such obvious love for pets. We bring our bloodhound and my fiancé's lab here and couldn't be happier. They are reasonably priced, family owned, caring, gentle, and truly wonderful people. 5 stars aren't enough!< /Text>

Never ever going back. I dropped off my dog at 11:45. They said pick her up at 3-4. I called they said come at 4:30. I got there at 4:30 and they had only bathed her. Then the groomer says come on in so you can help me with her... umm ok? My dog is a tiny bichon. Is this what they always do? As I was helping her the machine she was using to cut my dogs hair was hot and kept turning off. I ended up leaving with hair all over which defeats the purpose of me paying someone rather than doing it myself. I do not know how they have all these great reviews. Maybe when the owner is there things are different but I will definitely never go back. The receptionist didn't even greet me when I arrived. As I was in there I noticed everything is old and dirty. Paper and hair all over the floor. I cannot put into words how bad this place is.< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) They badly hurt one of my dogs, and they treated him for fleas and when they were in my house they scratched more than when I took them so that they check their pets well, they won't do the service that was paid for.

Also unless you treat your home(where your dog gets the fleas) and give your pet month flea protection chances are as soon as they get back home they will be flea infested again.

I stopped in to see if they had the same vaporizer I have. I thought it was dead! The guy was very nice, professional and highly knowledgeable! He right away knew my vaporizer and quickly knew a way to fix the problem! One moment in his hands and voila! I asked how much it would be for his help and he said don’t worry about it. It did only take 30 seconds max. I was so shocked because I am so used to getting ripped off everywhere you go! Everyone has some fee or another but the guy did the right thing and didn’t charge me. I highly respect this store for that! When it’s time for a new kit I will definitely be coming back here! I highly recommend this place! The customer service is impeccable!!! Thank you!</text>

<text>Order team does not update you regarding your shipment even after waiting 72 hours. It is now 5 days later and they have yet to ship my order. Horrible store which sends auto generated responses and blames there shot commings on covid. Don't shop. Check out element vapes. Super fast shipping!< /text>< Pictures>

<review>I put 4 stars only for shipping prices. Otherwise, it's the only place I can find NAKED liquids. The customer service is great and the shipments are fast. I will continue to buy from you being a long-time customer. Thank you for everything guys. If you can lower shipping prices, of course, I will change my feedback by putting 5 stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐<//review><GmapID>0x80dd26e9c84fac1d:0xd840a1fd86ca6db7< /GmapID>< resp>

Vapor DNA is the best bang for your buck! The staff are always helpful and listen to my needs, even if it means a less costly item. They have specials every day and always back up their merchandise. They are very knowledeable about their products and I can count on all of the staff to sell me what I need and not stuff I don't.< /text>

I have a hard time finding Naked100 products in San Francisco, so I have been ordering from VaporDNA.

To my surprise and delight; my juices arrived today and in the package with my 2 Brain Freeze juices was a Naked100 beanie!

That type of sh*t never happens to me so I am most grateful and will be recommending VaporDNA to anyone who will listen to me, haha!

Thanks again and you guys rock!

Cheers!

Hey staff! Great selection of Naked Brand and nice selection case of the Kilo Standars Series. Great prices of Tanks and atomizers. I got a new cascade mini from the store at a similar price to the  online retailers. Support local business! It’s good-for the local community. This is my new favorite vapor shop! Cody is extra helpful. Thanks, Zach< /text>

Best vape shop ever. Workers are dope, parking isn't too bad also since its next to a Walmart, In n Out is also in the same parking lot. They run out of stuff a lot (due to popularity of some items), but usually get their shipment pretty fast. There's always a different deal happening each day and then they have pretty good sales on a holiday or holiday weekend.</text>

Great people with great products but had a bad experience with them re-wicking. Eventually got it fixed and my second trip there was amazing. They built me some fused clap tons that and amazing. It cost $10 which I hesitated on paying, but now that I have them I'll always get my builds here.< /review>

<Text>Best High End Vape Shop.
Outstanding service, high end mods, atomizers, tanks, and great selection of Vape juices.
Their staff are all super nice and helpful and their prices on Juices and mods are competitive with what I have seen online, easily a 3rd cheaper for juice than any other shops I've been in.
They are a ten, best Vape shop I've been to in LA and OC.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>This store has been my go to for all things vape. They always have the best mods and liquids for a good price. I've recently been having issues with dryness in my throat due to vaping so I went in to find a PG free liquid. I forgot the name of the person who helped me but he was very knowledgeable. I bought an all VG organic liquid by Essence Vapor. Been vaping this since and haven't had any issues with my throat. Thanks VAPOR DNA!<//Text><Resp>None</Resp><Date>1544644800992<//Date><name>Mackenzie Miller< /name>< rate>

<text>Extremely poor service. They refuse to assist in tracking my shipment and have told me I have to wait 45 days for them to take any action on a lost shipment. Will never order from them again.

Don't order from their site. Shipping is trash and take forever to get their products to the post office. It took four days for the package to get to the post office. I don't know how this company runs like this. The only thing good is their customer service knows how to respond when you complain.

Items ordered can get stuck in processing when they run out of stock making you wait even longer. Would not recommend ordering online< /Review>

Sadly had a negative experience, after an error with a shipping address they only offered me a partial refund. The error was no fault of mine and I was disappointed they felt entitled to keep the money...</Text>

Not only did these guys have the mod (that not even sites had in stock), but they had it in the color* i wanted it in (also equally impossible to find).
They even had the ARCO tank, which again....no one else has. $80 scrolls out the door for both+a pack of coils? Yes please!
Not bad for a walk in, not bad at all

PS: NO vape snobs behind the counter....a big problem in this industry. It amazes me how both women AND men that work in vape shops tend to have a superiority complex. Not with DNA though.</Text>

I was a little skeptical about coming here since i've had bad customer service in the past with vape snob hard asses. which eventually lead me back to smoking traditional tobacco cigarettes again. But i decided to give this vape shop a shot and I am very glad I did. A really cool guy named Ryan helped me pick out a new starter kit based on what i told him my preferences are. He's friendly, knowledgeable, and walked me through step by step how to use my new device. He also hooked me up for being a new customer. I'll be making this my main spot for supplies. Thank you for your business!< /review>

I like how they merge Peet's w the cafe. Salads are awful and terrible value, but sandwiches are fine. The coffee operation, while branded as Peet's, doesn't accept Peet's cards. Better space for meetings than typical coffee houses.< /review>

Staff isn't the friendliest, but they are efficient and work well together.  I work ~200 yards away and will eat here twice a week for lunch.  The remaining times I'll jump in the car to eat somewhere else.</Text>< Pictures>

Tasty sandwich.  I got the roasted veggie sandwich.  At nearly $10, it seems a bit small, and comes w no fanfare: sandwich on a slice of paper.   No garnish.  No table service.
Basically a healthier and more tastefully decorated version of McDonalds.  At thrice the price.
Im not complaining, its exactly what I expected.  Decent food.  Overpriced chain store, decent food.< /text>

Purchased a cinnamon sugar morning bun today. Took 1 bite and the bun tasted sour. Had the same product from other Specialty's before and those tasted good. Will assume it's an issue with this specific location.< /Text>

Depending on the time and being in between multiple offices this Cafe was awfully empty. Only a handful customers were visible at 2.00 pm. It is spacious inside. The staffs seemed ok. When i received my iced tea the tea was spilling from all the sides of the cup. Doesn't give me a good impression at all. I am sure the server could have taken a bit more care to prevent it from happening.</Review>

<review>Great sandwiches and soups (try the thai curry soup!), and the bread is always good quality just like their branches up in SF. I love their semisweet chocolate chip cookies, because they're chunky, moist, and made with high-quality chocolate. They also have mini bundt cakes that are just right for one person (the chocolate one is the best). There's tons of seating inside the cafe, but since it's one of the only cafes in the office park, it will be packed during lunch hour. It's slightly more expensive than what I would like to pay for in Redwood City, but it's good food. Annoying though that Specialty's does not have an Android app; it makes it hard to earn rewards if you're not on an iPhone.</review>< user_name>

< Review>
Ah, Specialty's. I've been coming here for over a year now. Here is an honest synopsis.

The Good
- The wait staff are usually friendly
- This is one of the few (if not only) place in the Bayshore Technology Park for food.
- The cookies (when done right) are to die for. Salads mostly yummy.

The Bad
- Overpriced, they have a monopoly and they know it. They have a buy 12 get 1 free deal but beware they count online and in person orders (even if you use the same card) differently.
- They have a tendency to get orders wrong or forget what you ordered even with the high tech system they have. Seriously?! But, their saving grace is amazing customer service, they will fix what they do wrong if you complain, as well give you free stuff on your next visit -- decent.
- They often burn cookies, I don't know why.
- Just about every sandwich here is made with gobs of cream cheese. The breakfast sandwiches are dry and skimpy on the meat. Why not compete with other places nearby by offering them on bagels, English muffins, or in the form of a breakfast burrito? It wouldn't be a stretch.
- Worst thing is the paper cups they use for coffee. They are good for one use. If you refill it, the stuff the paper is made out of leaches into your drink and tastes like you are eating rotten painted cardboard, yech.

There are 3 starbucks and a peet's nearby, so I'd recommend getting coffee elsewhere, but if you have a hunger for the other good stuff they are known for, Specialty's aims to please.<//Review>

My steering wheel was straight and tight. Drive was much better. The girl at the desk was nice and speedy upon arrival.

I had a slow tire leak and called for an appointment but they were fully booked. They said that if I came in they would try and fit me in but I would have to wait a while. When I came in they immediately took my info and were super nice assuring me I would get squeezed in as soon as possible. I didn’t have to wait that long and the waiting area is very nice. Once the tire was fixed, the problem was a nail and the service man handed me the key and said there was no charge!!
I had bought a tire from them for a different car a year before, so I thought maybe it was a good will gesture, but even if it wasn’t I am a committed customer for life. Great place to do business!<//review>

I brought one of our company Vehicles here. The assistant manager came to my assistance. I had a bubble on one of our tires. The first thing he did after he checked the tire was in for me that this tire was still under warranty. He didn't try to sell me something extra. They took care of the tire charge they did a great job!<//Review>

<text>Love you guys!! I was a walk in for a oil change, So happy I picked you guys after reading the Yelp reviews, the staff is amazing and attentive, I did not know my tires where from your store, as you also gave me a free rotation and checked my breaks for me! As a female and most females are Leary of mechanics and getting charged for things that do not need to be done, you guys are sooo NOT in that category of people! I will for sure recommend you to all my female friends, I wasn’t sure if tipping was aloud? But would love to buy you all a pizza!! If can? Warm Alohas! And mahalo for showing much aloha on the mainland! Keep it up!!!🌺🤙🏽<//text>< pics>

On our way home up the 101, we had 2 tires explode! We were in the middle of nowhere and needed a tow. We were counting down the minutes to try to make it to this Schwab before they closed. We had to get a tow 115 miles to the store and they waited an hours after closing for us. I have NEVER been more impressed with any service I’ve ever received. These guys work so hard and with a smile on their face. If you ever need tires, know that these guys will help you in anytime of need and they supply some amazing tires. We are so thankful for them!!</Text><Response>None<//Response></record>

<Text>Les Schwab has been the only company I rely on when I have issues with my tires, wheel well, suspension, or any other facet, system, or device relating to the wheels on my car. Both times I have had to use them, the bill was about $1000 dollars. As a young, college aged kid, that kind of figure terrifies me when it comes to just about anything— but the thing that made that number more easily digestible for me was this teams incessant eagerness to work, and visible dedication to service. Everything from their ethic, to their demeanors, to their shop and all the way down to the small things like the way they smile or greet you in the parking lot; everything here is done for the customer. Both times I walked in with a car that was in no shape drivable or operable, both times I felt like absolute garbage and was in crisis mode, trying to figure out what my next step would be; I had no idea that next step would be figured out for me by the wonderful people at this wonderful company. They helped me manage my automotive crises, and have given me NO reasons to find anyone else to do that job. They do it far too well, and I do not intend to find another company, nor will I ever deem it necessary to do so— Les Schwab is the only automotive company I think I’ll ever find myself a recurring customer of. If you’re not in a great fiscal position to get things bought and paid for on the spot, they helped me set up a line of credit despite, as before mentioned, being a regular old college kid with just about as much money as he did brains. The level of pride they have for what they do manifests itself in the level of cleanliness in their shop and professionalism in their tone, and even the fact that these guys seem to know just about everything about cars adds to the entire environment they attempt to exude. To all the wonderful people down there at that little slice of heaven called Les Schwab Tire, thank you. You’ve made a customer for life, and in a weird sort of phenomenon, I almost look forward to parting with my money so long as it’s going into your hands.</Text><response>{'time': 1582067742530, 'text': 'We appreciate the opportunity to earn your trust, Michael!

<Review>Moved to Hollister a out 2 years ago and still had my a count at Wheelworks.  But I was certainly surprised when I got my account with Les Schwab and took my truck in for new tires.  The staff were knowledgable, courteous, kind and just generally super easy to work with.  Their techs also take a lot of pride in their work a d wont ever return your vehicle to you without it being in better condition that you left it within in.  I'll never go anywhere else.

<review>We walked into Les Schwab with a tire that was low, & a sensor light that wouldn't go off. We were greeted by 2 nice young guys right in the parking lot, ready to help. They took the car right into the bay. We went inside, greeted immediately by 2 more guys, again, so nice, ready to help. They figured out the sensor problem, told us to contact Toyota & that it was likely still under factory warranty, we never thought of that. They took care of the tire, which needed to be patched, & checked all of the other tires & said there's no charge! We were pleasantly surprised not just with them not charging us, but for being so nice, polite, & so eager to take care of what needed to be done. Great job Les Schwab Tire of Hollister, for hiring guys that really care about the customer!! Great, great, experience. You've earned our business in the future.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Had my tires changed and got an alignment at the same time. The work done was fantastic and I was in and out fast. Customer service was great and everyone I talked to was helpful and answered my questions. Tires are priced a little higher than others in the area but with the warranty you get and all the extras it pays for itself!</Text>< gmapID>

Great service, great deals. You get free tire rotations, shock and brake inspections, and other stuff if you buy tires from them. I just drop it off, run to the store next door and by the time I get back it's usually done. The people there are eager to work. I came in on a "slow day" so they were much more willing to do work because they must have gotten bored. Can't recommend them enough. Oh, by the way, they have free popcorn from a machine to help you snack.<//Text>

<text>This is the place for tires, brakes and suspension. If you have the option to try them out. I take all 3 of my family vehicles to them and I wouldnt trust anyone else. I live in Monterey and I commute to Hollister just for them when I need things fixed on my work trucks. Plus the warranty they give for the tires is pretty outstanding and their technicians are great and happy to work there. Also they are the most honest tire company with no rip offs.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Time>1511463968502< /Time><text>What a great bunch of people! I never feel like they're trying to sell me, they just give me good advice and all options. I pulled in thinking I had a problem and in minutes they told me I had just lost a wheel weight and replaced it. I got great tires for a decent price when I bought tires. I came in with my trailer and a bad tire and they gave me a free tire that was better than patching my old one. And they didn't have to do that. Les Schwab is known all around the country but new to this area. People know if they have a problem they will be there to help at a more than reasonable price or free. I would say that's how they get all their loyal customers. You can always count on a bag of popcorn and a cup of coffee free in there waiting area. And I understand that their employees love them too.</text>< userid>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Amazing customer service at Les Schwab Tire Center. Although, I have visited other tire shops, and they have great service, Les Schwab Tire Center truly has the customer in mind. I purchased four new tires and was incredibly impressed by how knowledgeable the sales representative, Judith was. I also appreciated the inclusives you receive when purchasing a set of tires from LST. The service was quick, professional, and friendly. I left with four brand new tires at an unbeatable price AND I got a great deal on a wheel alignment. Needless to say, driving away from the store reminded me of driving off the dealership lot for the first time because I felt like I was in a brand new car! The aroma of buttered popcorn and coffee first thing in the morning is a plus as well!< /Review>< pics>

Got one tire here. Was about to get a second one when i got a screw in one of the other tires. They informed me that they did tire repair on run-flats. Came in and they performed the patch for free since I had bought one previously. In and out quickly and with great service.< /text>

<review>It was just a overall great experience. I dealt with shane and he was a a-1 Human all together. His service was welcoming and left me with a drive (no pun intended) to go recommend Les Schwab to everybody I know with vehicles. So Thanks Shane. Thanks Les Schwab!!! P.s. the popcorn was a great touch😉</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Always the best products... Tires, wheels, alignments, brakes, suspension. Whatever I've "needed" in the last 22 years in 6 states the knowledgeable staff has been stellar. I have never been over sold on service or product. I'm a Les Schwab Lifer.< /Text>< gmapID>

Not pleased. Took two brand new tires to be put on and balanced because the old ones were going bald. Cost over $80! and one tire continued to lose air after it was pit on. The rim was repaired previously, but worked perfectly fine before I brought it here.
Now the car was returned in state less than I took it, and they wouldn't even do a partial refund.<//Text>

Quick visit in today for a set of tires for the front of my vehicle. They even let me have my dog inside while I waited. Only took about 30 minutes from the time I walked in to when I left. This place holds up to the high standards I have for Led Schwab Tires Centers!< /Review>

A+ service with a professional staff that goes beyond the call of duty to provide for their customers. I rolled up with a flat tire and a flat spare and was immediately taken care of by Leonard and Chad. Both gentleman made sure my experience at Les Schwab was positive. While I don’t live in the area, I will forever be grateful for the kindness of the staff. Thank you.<//Text>

I already appreciated Les Schwab from past experiences but this was different. I brought my truck in for breaks and bearings and it did not go smoothly for them. They ran into problems and fixed everything without raising the original price. The customer service was second to none and I would highly recommend this store to everyone.< /Review>

<review>My tire was leaking air and finally got around to taking it off my car, it had a plug so I didn't think it was fixable, but they fixed it, the quote was 14 dollars but they didn't charge me. Very nice people working there, clean shop too.<//review><Response>None<//Response>< UserId.>

Our boat trailer lost a tire while transporting our boat, not only did they fix it, they let us leave our boat there while we waited for parts to get it fixed. The crew was so accommodating and helpful, we couldn't ask for more. I have always been a Les Schwann customer now my fiancé wants to be a lifetime customer.< /text>

This a great place to come for a walk to get away from urban sprawl. The Arroyo Seco cuts through the western part of Pasadena and provides a natural area of trees and wildlife providing you can ignore the concrete channel containing the mostly dry Arroyo Seco Creek. From the Colorado Street Bridge south to the Los Angeles River, there are easy pathways and plenty of places to explore.< /Text>

<text>I walked along the trail next to tall trees. My toddler and I enjoyed seeing butterflies and passing by horses and dogs with their owners. This is secluded place like a private place. Please do not litter and be quiet for peoples who meditate somewhere up the hills sometimes.< /text>< GmapID>

<Review>Wow, I've lived in LA since 1969 and I'd never been to this park ... and it's pretty cool and there is much more of it I can go back and discover.  The fly fishing casting pool, though, that was totally unexpected. We liked that there frogs growing along the wedges. And then a decent walk along clear patches LEDs us under the Colorado Blvd Bridge and then under the 134 Freeway.  The only down side is that Arroyo Seco smells really bad in places.</Review>< pics>

<Review>A decent park with lots of walkers and dogs. Not everyone is responsible with their pets, unfortunately. I was surprised how many were off-leash, especially when I see coyotes in the area. Still, the trails are nice and the natural sections give some much needed shade.<//Review><user>111514037706187896774<//user><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< username>

<Review>If you want a nice walk in the woods,this is a good location.

Two main trails,both easy, one going north to the Colorado St Bridge and the other going South along the Arroyo Seco . The South trail on the west side passes the archery range and meanders through the woods. It has benches at intervals if you need to rest< /Review>< Resp>

Unless you have a specific purpose to be here, this park is one you should skip. It’s permit parking only with a single road in and out up and down a hill with low visibility. Getting out and walking is ok, but you’re in a valley and miss so much of the beautiful area around you.</Review>

<review>Amazing place. This is one of the oldest archery ranges in the country but is also an amazing place to walk your dog, go for a run, or ride your bike.

Great place for a nice walk alone or bring ur kids also pets... If u like to Fly fishing then there is also a nice pond made just for that... If ur into Archery then there is also a big area just for that as well... U can walk, jog, run, or even bike ride on all the different types of trails this place has for any1 from 5 years old to 85 years old & any1 in between...<//Text>

Great place for a hike or walk in a secluded area of Pasadena.  It is a nice getaway from the city.  A small stream provides nice ambiance for a relaxing time.  Take a break and watch some archery or fly fishing training nearby.</text>

Eroding, desiccated hillsides. Interesting plants. Bike and walking trails. Weird amazing outcroppings from the concrete Arroyo walls containing the LA Trickle. Beautiful bridge. Will be including this park in a report containing recommendations requested by The Parks and Rec Department.< /Review>

<Review>I had this place saved on Google maps as places to go. I was not disappointed. Amazing views of the bridge and the smells of nature are like no other. Really easy hike around the arroyo as well. Its a little of its way to get here and I feel it has a low key hidden gem to it.</Review>< pictures>

I come here as a Member of the Roving Archers Group. Great variation of different outdoor Archery Targets to shoot at. I believe there are people who come out there to shoot who have either not purchased the membership card as they come out playing music and talking super loud. There is nothing worse than trying to concentrate on the target when people in the lane next to you are blaring their music. I suggest contacting The Pasadena Roving Archers and paying the $20 to take the Safety and Certification class. You get a membership card and 2 years unlimited access to more than 20 Outdoor Targets to shoot at, no Broadhead Arrows!<//Review>

Arroyo Seco Trail is a 4 mile (round trip)  loop trail located near Pasadena, California and is good for all skill levels. The trail is good for hiking, walking, and trail running. It has an easy flat trail with no elevation. The trail start at the San Pascual stables in South Pasadena and ends by the Colorado street bridge. There are no major scenic view except for the bridge and the canal. However, this trail is good to get a cardio-workout. Overall, it's a decent trail with lots of trees and shrubs.<//text>

Great for jogging, strolling, or walking your dog! Follow the Arroyo river downstream for miles. Look for the hidden benches and grass area that are perfect for a picnic. Also, going north is worth: go under the Pasadena bridge and follow the river to the Rose Bowl (~30-45min).<//review>

< Review>
Arroyo park is a very peaceful and beautiful place to spend the day I should know because I've lived in this park for about 10 years now it offers a casting pond an archery range hiking trails and horse stables I personally enjoy treasure hunting the Colorado bridge is close to 100 years old now and people were coming here to the Arroyo back then you might be amazed at what a person may find< /Review>

Halloween express national city is the best one hands down!! An employee named Nator really went above and beyond what he had too in helping me find a costume so close to Halloween. He really was so kind and helpful! Best service ever<//Text>

JESSIE was very helpful. She helped me find the costume that best fits me and was very kind. She really knew her around  the store. CLAUDIA was also helpful. She was very sweet and answered all of my questions I had. I give both 5 stars. They really earned them. Thank you for making my experience very fast and easy.< /Text>

I had the very best customer service experience at this location. Everyone was very helpful, one of the most helpful employees Heidi went out of her way to help me and my 3 kids look for the right sizes and ideas with extra details to make our costumes look better. Halloween for us is always fun. I will definitely go back to this location next year hoping to see her again.<//Review>

The girl that helped us was named Heidi , she was so helpful and would communicate with my daughter to find out what she was looking for and what she was interested in. I’ve never seen that from any employee before! Besides her great customer service, her personality was awesome! Thank you Heidi for helping my daughter find a costume she loved ! Halloween Express is now #1 on my list!<//review>< Pics>

After going many times hoping that they’d have it she recognized us as soon as we walked in and brought it straight to us ! She went through all that just to satisfy one customer.

<Text>BEST PLACE TO GO FOR COSTUMES.
not only do they have everything you need, but they're customer service is amazing.  I go here every year because the staff is SO HELPFUL and makes it so much easier for me to put together all my crazy costumes. this year the owner overheard that I couldn't find 1 out of the 3 masks I was looking for, so he took my number down and specially ordered the mask for me ! BEST SERVICE EVER.  1 STOP SHOP.  EVERYTHING U NEED. BEST PRICES< /Text><Time>1571858106724< /Time><user_name>Lexy Flores< /user_name>< pics>

I was short $4 and the cashier helped me out. Very nice people and very good service. I didn’t catch the cashiers name but he was older with glasses a nice accent. Make sure if you stop by give this man a token of appreciation. 10/10< /text>

I would highly recommend this Halloween Express store. They have a great variety of customs. Great prizes. Customer service was very professional. If you're looking for a custom I would highly recommend going to the Plaza Bonita Bonita Halloween Express. Thank you Heidi for your help<//Text>

Halloween morning and I still did not have a costume a friend recommended me to costume express in National city, I was greeted at entrance by Claudia and although the store was a mad house she made the time to help me find a costume for my cousin and I and a friend that also did not have a costume!! She not only listened to what we wanted but also made suggestions... she has great customer service that and has made us a costume express customer for life!!!!<//Text>

Went in the store with very little time and the day before halloween. Looking at the costumes and accessories with confusion on my face cause I was limited. Here comes an employee named Heidi, asked if i needed any help. So I asked her if she could help me gather something up quick and easy. Sure enough she did the job. She was helpful and full of ideas. Thank you Heidi, when I return next year I'm coming to you!</review>

I came in last minute on Halloween morning and it was so crazy I felt like it was Black Friday but an employee named Claudia came to my rescue and help me find a costume for my son and my daughter.
It wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be Claudia was so professional and knew exactly what product was available. If it wasn’t for her my kids costume would not have been some pajamas lol I am so happy she was working that day.<//text>

I come all the way from temecula to visit my family  and I decided to come to the mall to shop with my husband after the mall on the corner by a steak restaurant  and I stop at Halloween express and let me tell you my experience  there was so wonderful the only down there was the heatness in the tent  but the customer service  change everything especially when i bumped into an employee  i believe her name was Sylvia  she found my perfect flapper costume we spend so much time in the fitting room she had so much patience and continued to bring all the flapper costumes until the perfect one. After trying it on Sylvia found all the accessories for my costume ( gloves, scarf, fake cigars ) best experience so far!!! Thanks Sylvia<//Text>

<text>I came yesterday looking for some specific horns to match my costume, I looked everywhere for them but couldn’t find them . When I asked Claudia for help she found them right away she hooked me up because I’m kinda blind . The fact that she had the patience goes a long way , I’ll be back with my fam to pick up some costumes thanks again.< /text>< Pics>

<review>We spent 2 hours in this store looking for a costume for my 11 year old.   She's to big for teen costumes to small for adult costumes. Marissa was there at the dressing room as we tried I'm 12 or 13 different outfits. I guess Marissas time was complete at the dressing room and she saw us looking around still. Took the time to see what my daughter wanted to be. I think at this point it was anything lol.  But we finally found a "wednesday adams" costume that fit perfect.  My daughter was beyond thrilled and went back to find her and give her a hug. Just as we were at the giving up point too!  Thank you Marissa!!!!< /review>< date>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Halloween exprees, beautiful square. Buy some items for my daughter, ask before paying if they will change it in case she did not want it, they said they did not return money only exchanged for merchandise. The next few days I went, because he doesn't like me, the manager did not want to change me, that due to hygiene policies, something that I was not told, it makes me in bad taste that being a manager does not believe in my word, I call him his employee to verify and if he said he remembered me, but not the change. I never come back, better party city, very arrogant girl.

(Original)
Halloween exprees,plaza bonita. Compre unos artículos para mi hija,pregunte antes de pagar si me lo cambiarán en caso de que ella no lo quisiera,dijeron que no regresaban dinero solo se cambiaba por mercancía.  Alos días siguientes fui,por que no le gusto, la mánager no me lo quiso cambiar,que por políticas de higiene,cosa que no se me dijo,se me hace de mal gusto que siendo mánager no crea en mi palabra,le llamo a su empleada para verificar y si dijo que se acordaba de mi,pero no del cambio. Jamás vuelvo,mejor  party city, muy prepotente la muchacha.< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
My husband and I came here after a friend recommended S & S Hardwood Floors. There’s a great selection of flooring and we were very impressed with their professionalism. The staff took time explaining different kind of woods to us, which we really appreciated as new home owners. We are very happy with our purchase!</Review>

Love the quality of the flooring that we bought. And the amazing costumer service. I needed specific floors that are best with kids in the house and can handle lots of wear and tear Shlomit helped guide me to what would be the best option for us. 100% great quality here.<//review>

<Text>After checking a few places, I decided to go with S & S hardwood floors. They had great material with good quality, and even better prices.
Also, the people working there were very accommodating and helped me with anything I needed!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I’ve been mailing parcels and letters from this location for a year and haven’t encountered any difficulties. The staff do a great job!

USPS will provide you boxes if ordered online which makes it a breeze to pack things ahead of time. Otherwise bring your own packing materials (tape, scissors, etc) to finish the job on site. There is a self service station for domestic packages and they do money orders and passport photos here too. Plenty of free parking.</Text>

I was trying to get an priority envelope prepaid with specific amount ($12 to be exact) with a tracking sticker attached to it so the recipient can put my docs in there and mail it back to me as I can track it.  The receptionist spent quite some time doing math and came up with stamps of $12.35 and I said so be it.  Then I was told there's no tracking info for that as "we don't know when it will be shipped."  Regardless I told them this has been done so many times (USPS actually sell prepaid priority envelopes w/tracking) I was shut down and the folks were really impatient like I should never challenge their knowledge.  I decided to leave and got it done in another USPS place in Palo Alto (got exact postage and a tracking number on my prepaid envelope).  The passport application in this location is painless though.</Text>

I use this post office all the time.  The staff there is very knowledgeable, courteous and helpful.  Three staff members I have gotten to know pretty well.  They always help me find the cheapest way to mail something.  Today one of them noticed that I had too much postage on one envelope and not enough on another one.  I said I would buy more stamps to cover the one that was low, but she instead gently peeled the extra stamp off my over-stamped letter and put the stamp on my under-stamped letter!  They often do kind things like that for me and I'm so grateful. Today a woman was yelling at one of my favorite staff members - I wish I'd been able to think of what to say to defend the staff.  Please, can we all remember that our USPS workers have to follow rules - they can't change rules for us (that's what this woman wanted today).  Also, the USPS worked extremely hard to make sure our mail-in ballots got delivered on time even when they had many obstacles put in their way.  Thank you USPS!  -- One week later, I went back to the post office again today and there was yet another extremely rude customer!  I don't know how the staff stays so calm and helpful.  This time the rude customer refused to wear a mask even though it is required and the post office was full -- two of us asked her politely to wear it and she just said, "I'm staying six feet away" and shrugged. The post office worker asked her and she complied.  This same worker was so helpful, saved me money and helped the people ahead of me with sealing up their package.  Wish I could give another 5 stars!< /review>

This is the worst post office possible. Carolyn is the rudest sales associate ever and should be fired. After speaking with her in a nice manner about not receiving mail for the past 3 months she decided to ignore me when I asked to speak to a manager. I’d been to the post office 3 times over the past 3 weeks and still nothing was done to resolve this issue. Carolyn told me I was not allowed to speak to manager and then ignored me and called the next customer. She’s absolutely terrible and should be fired immediately.<//Review>

They would make a french post office jealous! They are slow, under staffed, not specially pleasant, often they are lost in their own products. You would think that when they see 10 people waiting for 10 mins they would rush ... but no! Maybe I miss it and this is just the business which is like this worldwide!<//Review>

So i had this amazon package that "came" on October 15 and it said that nobody was home at 10:43 am but whole family was there. I really wonder why they cant knock at the door and LEAVE the package at the door??? like is it really that hard? even a 12 year old could do better</review>

This office is perfect, the staff is very polite and helpful. I went to my passport appointment, and the lady took the picture, but she made sure I really liked that picture if not she would take another one. They even wait for me ,because I forgot all my papers so I had to go back home and then come back. I really appreciate that . Those five stars are well earned 🙂<//text>

I had an amazon package that apparently could not be delivered because nobody was home - this was not the case (people were home!). I was then told to go pick up the package at this post office location on Bayshore. I got there and waited 10-15 minutes for an employee to find the package. They told me they could not find it. It is a true shame that a public institution could have such a bad reputation. This post office is known as being one of the worst on the Peninsula - I concur!</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808fbba61a81b2e9:0xd8926234ff5cd692< /GmapID></record>

<review>This post office is literally the pit of all lost, misplaced or undelivered packages. The staff is horribly rude and unhelpful. You will never get to speak to anyone that can help at a tier 2 or above level and there is such a language barrier, that you will not be able to communicate well.

TLDR, this place is bad. Avoid at all costs.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Worst Post Office. No postmaster or station manager since last year. The office never answers the phone and that was pre-pandemic. All employees yell at customers when they don't UNDERSTAND simple requests or inquiries. Very rude employees with no professionalism. Also employees will give out personal information regarding anyone. The Hispanic woman who works there always gives me not so pleasant looks everytime I'm there. As if she is trying to intimadate me. She is very obvious about it. She will literally watch me everytime, it's really annoying. She also gave my personal information to a third-party. Employees act as if the customers are a bother. USPS needs to step in.<//Review>< Name>

<review>Why are nearly all the employees and mail carriers working for the Palo Alto post offices Chinese?😡 I thought racial discrimination in the workplace is against the law.
The clerks working the counter are always arrogant and unfriendly, and they block you from contacting the Post Master there.< /review>< resp>

They have repeatedly lost packages of mine.  Especially prescription medicine requiring a signature.  I am filing a police report.  I have called for the last half hour, calling again when the phone disconnects, and no one answers the phone during working hours.  I have never left a 1-star review but this is highly deserved.  We pay enough to live in Palo Alto and should have at least a moderately reliable post office.  This one is an embarrassment to the United States.<//Text>

<Text>This location has lost more than ten packages of mine in the past year. They put a slip in my mailbox saying the "package was not deliverable because no one was home" even though I am! Or  saying that the mailbox is full when it isn't. When I go to the post office to pick up the package with the slip, they say it isn't there and they can't find it! They always take my information and say they will call back but never do!< /Text>< pictures>

I like my experience. They do there job to the best of their ability. They were so helpful. I like going straight to the office. I like to speak to a real person and ask questions face to face. That's how I get my questions answer. Tried online and calling, but person to person interaction is way better.< /text>

The Postmaster Arthur was very helpful when I had a priority mail letter that did not arrive.  He even checked on the letter when he was not at work and had it delivered as soon as it arrived.  Thanks for the prompt personalized service!<//review>

Famously bad USPS service as it is. But this location has the worst service of all. The staff are stealing, I lost a package there, the camera has showed my stuff was in their warehouse, but they couldn't find it. I wonder the 5 star rating was conducted by whoever works there. The Asian guy helped me there, super bad service.<//Text>

Needed to send an international package. Post office did not have a single customs form for packages under 4 lbs. Clerk checked all the drawers in all counters and the back, I checked all the form containers in the "outside" area. Not a single one.

Clerk was polite about it, but in the end USPS couldn't process my package.< /review>

If you are a customer facing and client-oriented employee then you should be able to communicate clearly.  I was helped when I was there by a very helpful woman in the back warehouse area, who helped me make an appointment for later. I've been trying the last few days to cancel my appointment for Passport help, however, to no avail.  I wanted to add to the string of no-answer complaints.  I've had the same experience as others where the phone is almost always busy, or no-one answers the phone at the end of the day.  Sorry if anybody was trying to make an appointment for a passport for tomorrow. Maybe do a walk in and try your luck.<//Text><Rating>2</Rating></record>

I try calling this USPS to tell them to hold my package, they never answer their phone and it always says busy line. But when is 30minutes before they close it rings again but no one ever answers. I prefer UPS or FedEx, the minute you call them they answer you and your set in less than 10minutes.</Text>

<Review>One customer complained loudly and unreasonably while the employee behind the counter kept asking her to get in line before she could be helped. "I don't want to talk to you, I want to talk to someone else!", said customer. Sigh.

Employee recognized the long line and eventually called out the manager to handle the situation so that he could help the next in line.

Fast service, really nice employees.< /Review>< gmap_id>

I unfortunately had a terrible experience with this post office at two different instances. The first situation occurred when I waited at home for a package that was guaranteed to arrive by 12:00 on a given day and actually arrived at 4 pm. This usually wouldn't be a problem, but the post person dishonestly reported that the package was delivered at 11:15, so the money was not refundable - and it was incredibly time sensitive. Not to mention that I ended up having to take off work because the package was late.

The second instance is even worse. I waited at home again one day to receive a guaranteed priority package. The post person delivered one of my packages, but not the second priority package. They did, however, mark that the package had been delivered, which I know was not true because I was sitting outside when the other package was delivered. I went to the post office two days later (arriving an hour early to make sure I would be able to talk to someone as soon as it opened), and the person behind the counter raised their voice telling me the package hadn't been delivered yet and that I needed to be patient. When he took a deep breath and looked at the tracking information he realized he had read the information incorrectly. Rather than apologize he said, let me get my supervisor. He returned several minutes later saying his supervisor wouldn't talk to me until 9 pm (which didn't work for an individual with work).

I filed a report and attempted to call the post office numerous times, only to be put on hold for hours or not answered. So incredibly frustrating. Especially because I have used USPS for years and never experienced this before. The report I filed was later changed to "Resolved" even though I was not contacted or explained how...

The package is gone, and I will likely never find it.</text>

Disappointed that the lobby was not opened to 9:10 am today (7/11/15) - not the posted 7:00 am opening.   When I contacted the delivery folks through the side fence, it turned out that the supervisor was on the loading dock.  A female delivery person had to cajole him to get the doors open.  ugh.

Let's try to do better!</text>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>I wanted to mail a parcel and visited this office twice today, once in the morning and again in the afternoon. On both occasions, the post office was full of people waiting to have passport processing, which made the environment rather oppressive. There was only one person serving on the counter. When anyone had finished with their passport application, they had to come out of the passport admin room to pay their fee. They did this by cutting the mail counter line (not their fault) to pay, and then going back into the passport admin room. Needless to say, this resulted in the mail counter line going nowhere.  I waited 15 minutes in line the first time I visited, and not one single customer had their business completed in that time. Though I only had three people in front of me, I gave up. The second time I visited, there were at least 10 people in the mail counter line, so I didn't even join it (there was still only one person serving). Appalling service.< /Text>< user>

My daughter and I have been at the post office for more than 3hours waiting to renew my passport. The employee responsible on renewing the passports takes breaks without having anyone as a replacement. They have horrible costumer service and argues with each other and other costumers.

I was here for the past few days to renew my passport and came before 2:00PM. However, when the time reached 2.00 PM, the lady told all the people waiting in line to leave. Today, she said she was leaving at 1:30 so everyone (about 8 people) except for the first two people in line should come the next day, but according to USPS she should be helping people until 2:00 PM.<//review>

<review>Called 30 minutes ago (11/24/15 at 10:15am) to verify the status of a package that did not arrive at my business due to the weekend. No one picked up for 5 minutes, then I got a curt "one moment please" to my request. I put the phone on full volume/speaker and continued to do other work at my desk. I nearly forgot about the call on hold, and hung up 25 minutes later when no one picked up the phone. Awful service.</review>< pictures>

The employees here are joke. Rude, short tempered, uneducated and super slow. I will drive right past this place to another post office even though my son goes to school right next door. I have had over 5 horrible experiences here. Someone please come and help this branch understand what customer service and just being a decent human being is all about. This is the type of place that give government employees a bad name.< /Text>

This branch is one of the few that didn't require an appointment for passport renewals. I knew better than to arrive close to cloing time. I arrived right before 9am, only to find 4 families ahead of me. The office didn't open until 9:07. However, after the first family was admitted, someone came out and made sure that everyone's paperwork was in order, that they had the right payment, documentation, photos, etc. When he came to me, he told me that my renewal didn't have to go through the office, but my daughter's did. He helped me get my mail application ready and mailed it off to Philadelphia. My daughter didn't lose her place in line. The other families in line were friendly, which helped pass the time. We were out of there in 50 minutes.

The Passport office is open 9am - 3pm, but there are breaks from 11-11:20 and lunch from 1 to 1:30. Monday and Fridays are the busiest.< /Text>

< review>
I called on December 15, 2014 at 8:47am. I called three times. After connecting, the phone line was automatically disconnected.

Prior to my trip, I called to arrange for "hold mail". But my mail kept coming according to my neighbor.

When the post office cannot be reached and even after getting through cannot execute a simple order, its credibility is dented.<//review>

Online it says this office is open until 7pm, so I show up to pick up my package and no one is in the building. The door is open, but no one is working. Really helpful. What a stupid post office!!!!< /Review>

I love these guys. I am an eBay seller so I use this location all the time. The job these people do is as impossible as it is thankless. There is a certain amount of patience that is required to do business here, and there is a maze of confusing postal regulations that can give anyone a headache, but all in all the system works, and these guys get er done. Best to give a little lead time for your visit because there is likely to be a waiting line. In my experience, not as bad as the wait downtown or the Camebridge location.< /Review>

I ordered a 10-key for my laptop two weeks ago. It was shipped USPS last week. According to the USPS tracking site, it went out for delivery on Monday the 20th. It is now Friday the 24th, and it still hasn't arrived. I went to the USPS main office (which is only a few miles away) during my lunch break. They don't have it. And the clerk's suggestion is that the driver must have it on the truck.
Incompetence.<//Review>

Unfortunate experience, they marked our package as attempted delivery with this not being the case, claimed a note was left regarding the attempted delivery, no note was left. Scheduled a re-delivery, the package was not delivered for the 2nd time. Called to inquire where I was placed on hold for 30+ minutes with no response. No one came back to my call on hold...<//Review>

The WORST!  Unfriendly, un helpful, and most i importantly disorganized and doing a very bad job.

Packages cannot be found, mail is not held despite a filled from.

The management is unresponsive and when the usps provided a form for a redelivery of a package, and I filled it--and had confirmation--it was IGNORED.

I think the management is horrible and someone from above should step in--and change this post office.

To mail stuff out I go to the post offices in Menlo Park or Los Altos.  It is a world of difference.  Unfortunately I cannot change my post office that delivers my mail.</review>

Package was supposed to be delivered Wednesday jan 27
Was at work so couldn't get the door
They left no notification
I go in Thurs jan 28 to ask about my packages 5 minutes before closing and they refused to answer my questions and decided to argue for 5 minutes instead of helping me they were so rude and just said i have 15 days to pick up before they are sent back so I go back today sat. The 30th as soon as they opened cause I had time before work to go, just to find out MY PACKAGES WERE SHIPPED BACK TO SENDER THURS. THE 28 AFTER TELLING ME THERE WOULD BE A 15 DAY HOLD
Where can I file a complaint on their rude and irresponsible employees?<//review>

This is the worst of the worst service!! This cashier or service person pulled me out of line to help me wasn't able to help me so them told me to get back at the end of line !! WTH I was next why would I want to get at the end of a line of 10 people cause you dont know how to do your job or help customers that with out you would not be employed! !! Give training to you employees and make sure if  they want to help customers and make your business  grow not decline !!!<//Text>

<text>AVOID THIS USPS LOCATION AT ALL COST !!!

IF I COULD GIVE IT 0 STARS I WOULD!!!

USPS PALO ALTO CA --- MISSING PACKAGE AND BAD EMPLOYEE !!!! ---

-on 6/31/15 i called them to ask where my package was because the tracking information wasn't working online. when i called i was told that the package was picked up from the shippers mailbox and was on the way.

-7/3/15 i called to see where it was because the shipping label was for two days and it should have been here by now, when i called i was told that the package was picked up from the mailbox and that it was on the way but they could not see where it went, then the lady told me she would transfer me to someone. after waiting for 10 minutes to be transfered, another lady picked up the phone .
she asked how may i help you but she was another lady from the post office , not who i was supposed to be transferred too . i told her what was going on with my package and she said that the package was never picked up, only the label was created. when i asked her why the other lady had told me it was picked up she was baffled!! she had no idea why the first lady told me that.
the other lady working there said it was picked up ! she told me TWICE !!!!
something is going on within this branch that s not right!!!
After speaking with the second lady she told me a delivery supervisor would be calling me back , and guess what they never did

7/4/15- tday i called again because the supervisor never called me back ! IT TOOK ME 16 TIMES TO CALL THEM AND TO GET AN ANSWER !!! TWO OF THOSE TIMES I WAS ANSWERED THEN HUNGUP ON !!!
the same lady i talked to originally  told me my package was picked up on the 21st and she doesn't know where it went but she can't do anything so she said she would have the supervisor call me when they get there.. needless to say i don't think ill be getting that call.

i now have a $60 pair of pants missing now that i will never be refunded for . THANKS USPS for the horrible service and bad employees !

starting to think this location steals customers packages !!!!!!!!</text>< date>

The employee (lady) in the passport office is just rude! I had scheduled an appointment about 2 weeks ago and I called in to verify my appointment and she never scheduled me one. So I asked to schedule me another one and she wanted me to go in in another 3 weeks so I told her I didn't want it and I was going to walk in and she told me good luck. The other employee (lady) behind the counter has the same attitude I rather drive 5 more miles to another post office.< /Text>

Lazy employees, useless.  Late for work and slow to process.  Especially the passport office.  A poor reflection on our government.< /Text>

After waiting, they finally asked me what I needed help with, after finding out they went into the back for a while then told me to go to another post office which told me to go back to this one.</Review>

~FIRST AND  LAST VISIT~
1. No one was around to greet me. I almost left.
2. When I walked in the facility to pay, the lady at the register was on her phone and didn’t acknowledge me. Didn’t even bother looking up until I said I’d like to pay.
3. The interior was not thoroughly wiped and cleaned. Dust and debris are still on my dash and seat. (See photos)
4. I was asked what air freshener I wanted, yet no air freshener was provided.

Overall very disappointed with the service here and will not be returning.< /Review>

They did a fairly good job on the car, but the ownership has issues

Bathrooms are very bad ... as bad as they come

Tables broken and not removed, also graffiti

The temp was 100+ and there was no shade, and they had the Misty's off

Pricing is what you expect to pay, but the other places are normal, not filthy.

Its not just the business owners fault, the landlord has obviously made it even worse.

Go elsewhere<//review>

<text>The top guy Miguel was nice and professional. They gave me advice for my Camaro and added an extra shine for free‼️

I’m def RECOMMEND their services. There’s so much they have to offer. They are nice, quick and professional.

I take my baby Ebony seriously and I don’t play when it comes to her maintenance but after this service. She has found a new home 😍😘< /text>< user_name>

<Review>Came in today and purchase the budget wash for $17.99 I was not happy because they didn't wipe my doors down from the inside nor did they put shine on my tires after speaking with the manager he explained to me that the wash that I purchase didn't cover what I was asking for, he was very friendly and professional he said," today I don't want you to worry about it we got your back" they actually wipe everything down inside shine my tires and gave me a air freshener without charging me no extra money I guess it was a little bit of my fault for not explaining the girl in the back what I wanted. I will definitely bring all my vehicles here this is definitely my spot to come from now on highly recommended.< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< response>

Great car wash place, they wash your car through a machine, then hand dry, clean rims and interior for almost the same prices as you would pay anywhere else.< /text>

< review>
Has to be the second worst car wash in Moreno Valley. Brought my car here in the middle of the week and waited for 5 min before someone came out to ask what I wanted, then the car sat for another 15 min before they started to vacuum. I'd understand if the place was busy but there were only 3 other cars. They had one guy "washing" and he totally missed the roof. I told the manager who said no he washed the roof but even watching the video it was clear he didn't.
Would not recommend this place to anyone.</review>

<Text>pay full price to get close to nothing clean about your vehicle. The workers were very cranky or something on 10/25 and being a Spanish speaker, overheard them bad mouth customers just because they didn’t want to do their job.

April 10, 2019, 10:15AM,American flag was hanging in rags on flag pole. Asked manger to remove flag. Stated didn't have a replacement. Asked him to just take it down. He responded it wasn't the only ragged flag around. He stated that he was an American also and the sight of the torn flag didn't bother him and if I didn't like looking at the ragged flag, then I should stop looking in that direction. I stated that I would not be looking at it any more because I would not be back to his business. His answer was okay.☹️
The employees did a great job on my car, it's the manager that needs to be replaced.

<Review>Went today 8/3/19 my car wasn't even that dirty paid the 20dll and gave the man a 20dll tip. I saw that my interior was still dirty and streaky and there was sand still in the back seats I'm talking about they didnt even touch the back seat. My trunk was not vacuumed at all! def never ever going back. "IF YOU WANT SOMETHING DONE RIGHT, YOU GOTA DO IT YOURSELF" wasted 40dll for a simple outside carwash. Now i have to go back and vacuum my car myself 😡😡😒😒😒< /Review><pics>None< /pics><gmapID>0x80dca60cda6f8fcf:0x34ad89e3e7727d11< /gmapID>< name>

They offered me a half special and then when I went to pay they charged me full price plus extra for a truck. I tried to get truck back and they wouldn't give me keys back even do truck was not being washed yet. Had to pay to get truck back. Rip off and to top it off truck was not washed right and interior was still dirty. I asked them to clean again and they said it was clean enough they can't make it new. So I guess there is no charge for the free attitude<//Review>

Took my Dodge Ram 3500 Laredo crew cab dually in for washing.  To wide for drive through so had to be hand washed, besides washing entire vehicle,  they vacuumed the floors & floor mats, cleaned inside of all windows,  wiped down all 4 door panels on the inside,  cleaned my aluminum wheels & wiped on tire dressing to make them shine like new again. I was very pleased for the nice job at only the cost of $30.00, it was well worth the price since I would have spent atleast 2-3 hours washing it by myself. My time is worth much more than that to me!!! Highly recomend this place if your in the neighborhood of Moreno Valley, Ca. near March Air Force Reserve Base.<//text>

If I was a teacher I say it's a D+ maybe C-. Getting your car cleaned here is like waking up in the morning and putting a piece of gum in your mouth instead of actually brushing your teeth, tongue & flossing. It was so many spots un washed on my car I sent it back. I also pulled up my mats and they didn't even vacuum under them. That's basic car cleaning 101 is to pull the mats out. Even after I sent it back there was several spots I had to point out to spot clean. After the fifth spot I left. Didn't tip, it was not earned. Dirt stain on my hood from a dirty rag left in one spot too long. I hate paying for a service and having to finish the job myself. You can't just spray air freshener on my dirty seats and think that's gonna slide. I got the second from the highest package around $25. May be worth it to maintain a practically already clean car, but if you actually need to get your car cleaned, they half do it. Staff was however nice and polite but I don't see myself returning unless I'm begin cheap and or desperate.< /Text>< Time>

Hope to see you again soon!!!!!!!!'}</Resp><Text>I started coming to this car wash a little over a year ago and I can say that they have been pleasant & diligent in their work/service. The workers here are very polite to me. I haven't been disappointed. This is located close to my job but approx. 30+ minutes from home.  I admit I was a little skeptical about coming here due to all the negative reviews, but I took my chances and stopped in anyway. Last year I came on my birthday for a Detail bc my car really needed it. They did a fantastic job on the Detail & Wax.

I've been a few times after that day plus  I visited the car wash yesterday, I drove 30+ minutes to come to this car wash bc I like how they wash my car. I got the Deluxe Wash and received the same pleasant service I always get when I come here. I would definitely recommend this car wash to my friends & family who live in the area.<//Text>< Time>

Should have paid 1/2 the fee since they felt like cleaning only 1/2 my truck. This is the 2nd time they don’t vacuum or clean my vehicle the proper way. Will definitely not return.</Review>

Horrible, never come here I WARN you.
This place should be out of business very soon. Please take the time to drive to a different carwash even the $5 drive thru was will be a better option.< /Text>

Do not use this car wash.  They loose parts off your car.  The cover to my headlight washer, which is not easily removed, was ripped off my car.  Can't believe how nonchalant they were about damaging my car.  Wishing the worse for this incompetent establishment.< /review>

I got here at 745 they open at 8 payed 125$ for detail. Waited over an hour and in that hour they ran truck throw wash them let it Sit im the back and left it did not even dry it. They had 6 Employee standing around not doing anything. When i ask whats going on i was told my detailer late. I did not know that washing and dry out side of a car and putting Armorall on took a detailer. Could have wiped down dash cup holder door pockets do the window. Tell the detailer showed  up to shampoo that carpet.< /text>

<text>I have stopped coming to this car wash due to miguel's & roberto's poor attitude. These two lousy individuals need customer service training, they don't value customer's patronage, & overall seem unhappy about their jobs. After complaining twice about miguel & hoping things would improve, they didn't & they've lost my business. I will share my negative experiences @ Plaza Hand Car Wash far & wide with family & friends. Beware of miguel & his partner in crime, roberto.<//text><rate>1</rate><Name>Armando A.

Most amazing level of service. Educated me on methods of birth control and is always available over the phone when needed. Dr. Banooni delivered my son 3 years ago and he exceeded my expectations. I always feel comfortable with him and all entire staff. I would never change him for any other doctor. I drive from Orange County to see him now.< /review>

It is always so lovely to see Dr. Banooni. Though I am now past my years of growing my family, I am grateful to have our annual check-ins. It's unusual in life to have a care provider who has been present for so many significant milestones and I am grateful to have benefited from such a unique continuity of care from Dr. Banooni. I deeply appreciate his level of personalized and focused attention. He's a gentle and kind man and an excellent and thorough physician and I'm delighted to see him be a positive role model for the residents lucky enough to have him as a  mentor. We need more doctors in the world who not only possess an excellent command of their specialty, but have also mastered an assuring and warm bedside manner. I couldn't recommend him highly enough.<//Review>

I don't want to share the details of my visit, but will say, Dr. Banooni is an excellent doctor.  I would not change physicians and would not hesitate to recommend him.  Thankful to have him as one of my physicians.<//text>

<text>I've been seeing Dr. Banooni for 18 years and he is absolutely amazing. He delivered my son 13 years ago and I never think twice about doing as he recommends when it comes to my health. He's patient, personable, relatable and has such a calm and friendly demeanor. I don't hesitate to come to him with any health concerns or for support. I would absolutely recommend him if you're looking for a great practitioner!</text>< pics>

I have seen Dr. Banooni for years and he and his staff are amazing.  Incredible care of patients, he takes his time to answer all questions and I have never felt rushed by anyone.  I highly recommend him, he truly is one of the most caring Dr's I have ever known.</Text>

I had a great first experience with Dr. Gutierrez. She made me feel comfortable and at ease and really seemed to care about me and my concerns. I've been searching for a new OB/GYN for a while now and I wish I had found her sooner.</text>

The staff is so friendly over the phone and in person, the entire team is so personable, helpful, and friendly. It was my first time seeing Dr. Melissa Gutierrez and I had many questions before even getting into the visit (like insurance etc) and they were so helpful. My wait time was under 20 min and Dr. Gutierrez was so sweet and comforting with my Health concerns. It was quick, easy, and she helped me with next steps. I can’t wait to see her again and become a regular of hers - good doctors are hard to come by!<//review>

<username>Astrid De la Rosa<//username><text>This was my first time seeing Dr. Banooni and I could not be happier with my experience. This is honestly the first time in the past 15 years where I’ve had a positive experience with an OBGYN. He is honest, he is attentive to your needs but also informative as to changes you may need based on your plans. I am looking forward to continuing care with him!

If you are looking for a new OBGYN, I definitely recommend him!< /text>< Pictures>

This review is long overdue but Dr Banooni and his staff are AWESOME.  I was under his care from pre-pregnancy to postpartum.  At every step of the way, I was informed about all my options and was patiently tended to every time.  Because I have moved a lot, I have been a patient of several OB/GYN offices and I always felt rushed.  But I didn’t feel like that under Dr. Banooni’s care.  Another thing worth mentioning is that the nature of their business is reproductive care and baby deliveries, so I knew going in that on particular days, if there was a baby to deliver, there was a baby to deliver.  That means that as a patient of an office like that on those days, you have to expect rescheduling and longer waits.  When it is my turn to have my baby delivered, I would want the same attention.  What was special about Dr. Banooni’s office is that he actually was able to deliver my baby.  At other offices, you get the doctor available that day at the hospital.  Dr. Banooni also has an amazing bedside manner and his calm demeanor and composure made me confident about my pregnancy all the way.  Another great thing is that whenever I had a question when I called his office, I always got a call back from him.  I even had an emergency over the weekend and even received a call back from him promptly that same day.  I also want to mention that special help I got from Julie and Prisma during the times I needed it were very much appreciated.  They understood the immediacy of the care or issue I needed resolved and promptly came to my rescue.  I couldn’t recommend a better office for reproductive care.  Thank you so much Dr. Banooni and staff!<//Review>

Dr. Gutierrez is a terrific doctor who's knowledgeable and very responsive. I was able to get a same-day telehealth appointment and she was great at explaining things. I'd had my previous OB/GYN for 22 years until his retirement. I'm so glad I was able to find such a great replacement.</text>

<text>Dr. Banooni and his staff care about your comfort and experience. He and the nurses and MAs that assist him are warm, take their time with you answering all your questions, and never make you feel rushed.   Every once in awhile you may have to wait a bit longer bc he got called for an emergency delivery.  It occurs  with all OBGYN doctors, as it’s a major part of their purpose.  His care is worth the wait.<//text></record>

<text>Dr Peyman Banooni is a knowledgeable and trustworthy doctor that I have been seeing for 6 or 7 years.  Covid-19 has him delivering many babies, but he still has time for his other patients, fortunately.  Better schedule your appointment, because it may take awhile to get in.  Very popular!!</text>< pictures>

Dr. Banooni is amazing. Has such a calming demeanor to him. One of the things that is super important to me is the ability to get in contact with and to be able to see your doctor in a timely manner. My last OBGYN would take several weeks to even months to see even while pregnant, with Dr Banooni I can book an appointment within the same week.<//Text>

Dr. Banooni is one of the best doctors I have ever been seen. He takes his time with you, is kind, very professional and I trust his expertise. He has gone the extra mile to call me after hours. I would recommend Dr. Banooni as it is very rare to get this level of care.</review>

His bedside manner is top notch, and I can tell he's extremely knowledgeable and is always looking out for my best interest. I started seeing him when I was 21, and I can only hope that some day he will guide me through pregnancy!

The employees in his office are always well organized and kind. I love their online portal that allows me to make appointments, view my test results, and ask questions through the messaging platform!</Text><time>1593710181830<//time>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Dr. Banooni is the best, if I could give him ten stars I would. He is my obgyn and delivered our healthy, beautiful baby girl two weeks ago today! He is so calm and made me feel so unsafe in uncertain waters. I'm 49 so I was a little nervous to be giving birth, but he made me feel as safe as he possibly could.  He and his team really checked and double checked all my and the baby's vitals to make sure everything was normal. To top it off, he's just a nice guy and a joy to be around.<//Text>< response>

<Review>I had to get in to see a gynecologist due to an emergency issue with my bladder/fibroids and Melissa was able to squeeze me into a very busy day 24 hours after I was in the ER. She was very informative and explained everything in a logical and concise way. I so appreciate the straight-forward approach and now have a few things to consider before making some important health related decisions. I highly recommend Melissa Gutierrez!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I recently had my first examination with Dr. Melissa Gutierrez. She was very professional, thorough in her exam and extremely personable. I feel that Dr. Gutierrez has a great combination of high expertise and personal warmth, and it put me at ease. As a new patient, I was also very impressed with the Staff. They were all very helpful, attentive and caring. Although it appeared to be a busy office, it seemed to run very smoothly and very much on time.<//Text>

<review>Dr. Banooni is the best OBGYN I've ever had! I had an emergency cyst burst a few years ago and was trying to work with my previous doctors who immediately pushed for surgery to remove an ovary. Dr. Banooni came in with a non-surgical approach and it was ultimately the right option and of course best for my body. I've been seeing him ever since and he's kind, knowledgeable and I look forward to many years with him as my Dr.< /review>< Pics>

Dr. Banooni was negligent with me.  TWICE.  He unnecessarily caused me enormous pain, left me to languish in it and showed not an ounce of sympathy or concern when I let him know I was in pain over two months ago.  But that wasn't his first negligent action...

Three years ago, after we agreed on the SKYLA IUD due to my high estrogen and progesterone issues,  I woke up after having a polyp removed to find they put in a MIRENA IUD, which has 4 times the hormones.  I ended up with migraines within days, and they changed it a week later.  However, I was not given any explanation, or apology.  Just a rather condescending response, "I guess you know your own body."  Um, yeah, I'm not a doctor, nor some anti-vaxxing, anti-science freak, but I am medically informed.  I also expect that if we agree on inserting a SKYLA IUD because of my history of high estrogen and progesterone, I would hope I would wake up with a SKYLA inside me!  Seems reasonable, right?  But he was so well "respected" so I chalked it up to an honest mistake and let it go.  That was my mistake.  I should have left then and there.

I also had a history of fibroids, which I made sure to mention that they be monitored carefully since I already had a myomectomy at the age of 36 to remove several large fibroids.  Bottom line, even though Banooni had 3 ultrasounds over 3 years to look at, he treated me like a whiner when I sent him an ultrasound ordered by my Internist in Feb and complained of  pain 3 weeks out of the month of my cycle.  Banooni had no urgency to see me and put me off a month to even examine me!!!   I asked him politely to see me sooner since I was in pain and exhausted all the time.
He couldn't seem to understand why I was exhausted.  He put me off.

Then, a day before my appointment, he canceled.  He rescheduled for the following week, leaving me to languish further.  Then COVID hit.  My potential surgery to relieve me of my now worsening pain, got postponed indefinitely.  Meanwhile my belly had grown to the size of a 6 month pregnancy and my back was so painful I couldn't walk!  I wrote Dr. Banooni an email telling him, since he hadn't bothered to examine me still 6 weeks after getting the ultrasound.  He was seeing pregnant women.
But he decided I could wait.  Meanwhile, had he looked at my ultrasound from Feb, he would have known I couldn't or shouldn't.  So -all I got was an email back telling me there was nothing he could do and he billed my insurance $250.00 for a telehealth visit!  FOR AN EMAIL!

I mean if he had seen me on Facetime or Zoom, he would have actually seen my giant swollen belly.  My Internist was so alarmed,  he sent me to another OB/Gyn for a 2nd opinion.  This new Ob/gyn (who is just as well respected at Cedar's) saw me same day and scheduled me as emergent after getting an MRI within 48 hours.  I had surgery within a week. My uterus was covered with over 25 fibroids and was larger than a football!

It was causing digestive issues, leaning on my intestines, bladder and spine, causing sciatica and excruciating back pain.  My back is still sore 3 weeks later, and I will now need PT to deal with the repercussions of Dr. Banooni's negligence.  Incidentally, my new OB/GYN who knows Banooni well, and was shocked at his treatment, or lack thereof.  He called him negligent, and you know doctors are woe to disparage other doctors.

I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with Dr. Banooni, as is my Internist and new Ob/Gyn.  I was always polite to him,  and I gave him the benefit of the doubt after the IUD screw up.  I cannot tell you how sorry I am that I did.

Incidentally, if you are also Dr. Kornreich's patient and she is referring you.  Please do not hesitate to ask her for someone else if you're not getting the treatment you deserve.  I am certain she is quite concerned that her patients are well treated, and I can only believe she found this situation with me shocking.  I do not fault her in any way.  I cannot say the same about her colleague, Dr. Banooni.< /Text>

<Review>After interviewing several doctors for a surgery I needed, we found Dr. Banooni.  We have been overjoyed with our experience. His bed side manner is kind, patient, knowledgeable and has always put me at ease. My husband loves him too. My experience first started with a surgery to remove a cyst and help alleviate major pains I was having throughout my monthly cycles. I was only a few months away from my wedding and really wanted to have enough recovery time as well. He found a way to push up the surgery date and did the surgery smoothly with no complications.  He also guided us gently through our first miscarriage and then through a successful pregnancy. When it came to delivering our son, he is the best! We had an uncomplicated delivery and it was wonderful to have him by our side, excited for us and smiling as we waited for our son's arrival. When it came time to push, he was a cheerleader and an ultimate professional. We are so thankful we found him and are looking forward to baby #2!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>Dr. Banooni has been my OBGYN for the last 14 years and he is wonderful.  His amazing demeanor and kindness helped me overcome a devistating second miscarriage before we had our two amazing boys in 2008 and 2011. He guided us expertly when our eldest needed an emergency C-Section and he was skilled and thoughtful about how to approach my care when I wanted to try a V-BAC 2 years later, and by stepping away allowing me the time for my body to do its work, he was able to successfully deliver our second son via V-BAC, even though I was a week overdue and our son was bigger than expected. He has continued his excellent standard of care all these years later, carefully checking on my health each year, as I have to be vigilant due to an unfortunate family history of breast cancer.  I would recommend him to anyone who has had difficult pregnancies, difficulties getting pregnant or difficulties during delivery.  He is careful, thoughtful and incredibly good at navigating all the issues that could come up.  And he's great even when routine care takes 5 minutes or less.  As I am moving into menopause he's been very informative and careful to help me navigate this transition, too.</review><user>111676861844047083825< /user>< Pics>

<Review>Dr. Banooni and his staff are always super professional. On my most recent visit, I showed up early because I had new insurance information and it was as painless as it could possibly be. I shared my new insurance info and then was immediately escorted to my room to see Dr. Banooni. One thing I have always appreciated about Dr. Banooni is the fact that every time I see him, he looks me in the eye and shakes my hand when he greets me. True Professional!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I have been coming to this office for many years, and now seeing Dr. Banooni as my previous long time Dr. Goldman has retired. This is great health care. This is what we want. I travel all over and feel unsteady when I am not at my own doctor. Thank you Dr. Banooni. Cheers!< /Review>

<review>It’s rare to have a doctor as professional and caring as Dr. Banooni. My family is filled with deep gratitude for Dr. Banooni and his lovely staff. For the rest of my life I will be thankful to have had Dr. Banooni guide me through my pregnancy and deliver my beautiful baby. It’s a deeply personal experience and I wouldn’t have wanted anyone else to be a part of this momentous part of our lives.
Dr. Banooni is thorough, professional and warm. I always leave feeling like he genuinely cares about my well being. In my opinion he is one of the best doctors in the county.
Thank you Dr. Banooni!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>Dr. Banooni is amazing. I am someone highly sceptical and suspicious of a lot of medical intervention but I can honestly say I have always felt comfortable and confident with the healthcare I am provided with him. When I found out I was having monodi twins, I sort of mourned the fact that I would not be able to have a natural home birth. Since then, I am not only comfortable with a hospital birth and a csection, I look forward to it. I am so glad I did my research first and was able to choose Dr. Banooni and Dr. Rad to bring my identical twins in to this world!<//Review>< user_name>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>While I had a great deal of respect for the doctor during my visit, dealing with the day to day needs has frustrated me to tears.  The email portal messages have gone unanswered. Critical prescription renewals, not responded to, office staff with attitude when you give up on the unanswered messages through the secure email portal... and incorrect dosage instructions on a prescription?  These are enough to sour any patient on a doctor and his office staff.  Forget the pretty pictures on the website! If a physician and his staff will not return calls and emails in a timely manner, will not service the refills they prescribe with accurate dosage and instructions, what good is the physician’s care?  There is no trust here now.  I am gravely disappointed.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Well after 6 doctors I can only say it was a BLESSING to be referred to Dr Banooni. I had found out that I had a large Fibroid Tumor and the only option was surgery. Not only did he take 2 hours to discuss everything with me and explain our options but he's so caring and he was the only doctor that didn't just rush to the worst case Hysterectomy. He was understanding to my concerns and needs as well as my approach. He literally is worth every penny, every moment driving to see him and check up. I can't say more amazing things about him. Best surgery, best doctor in the state of California hands down. Blessed to have met him and have him to help me for life :)</review>< date>

<review>It's not a good idea to choose your physician based on patient reviews; however,  in this case, you are in good hands.  Excellent physician.  Excellent care.  He's been my doctor for over 10 years, was my surgeon once,  and has always exceeded my expectations.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I couldn't believe the number of positive reviews and was actually slightly skeptical (I'm a skeptic and super nervous at the doctor) and my expectations were met and exceeded. I had to get my second Nexplanon removed, and this experience was exponentially better than my first one. He was calm, patient, and confident which was necessary due to my nerves. Highly recommend!<//review>< Name>

Fantastic experience as a new patient today with Dr. Banooni! Despite having an incredibly busy practice, his attention to his patients is clearly a priority for him. I knew he was listening to every word I said and concern that I had, and applying his medical expertise diagnostically. I would highly recommend Dr. Banooni to any woman looking for a great OB/GYN, regardless of her age or current medical concerns. I’m 100% confident he will help my husband and I successfully have a second child. His office staff was similarly amazing, caring, and respectful, and scheduled me quickly realizing how anxious I was about my fertility. Thank you so much!</Review>

Dr banooni is a wonderful OB. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for the most natural birthing experience possible. He was mindful of our wishes and understood we did not want interventional unless it was medically necessary. He never made us feel pressured, bullied, or judged. He has a calm,cool bedside manner that makes each visit enjoyable and really reassured me during the birth. This is my first baby so I had a lot of fear around the whole thing but Doctor Banooni made me feel heard, understood and respected every step of the way. Can't recommend him more!<//review>

Dr. Banooni was most informed and professional.  I thoroughly appreciated his patience in explaining relevant medical considerations as well as providing me with the necessary information to make a decision.  The office staff was also friendly and very helpful.  Thank you.</review>

Finally, in late June 2018, he suggested she return to his office since unusual things were coming out of her.  When he examined her, he said he did not abort everything!  He said he had to do it AGAIN!  They held her down!!!  No anesthesia!  Not even a Tylenol!  They held her down!  Painful and scary experience!  Dr. Banooni kept the $3,000 for a BOTCHED abortion!  Who knows if he damaged her uterus?!?  Only time will tell.

I am a working expecting mom so I appreciate that Dr. Banooni can fit me in early before my work day starts.  He also has a very nice waiting room and the offices are very warm and hospitable.  The nursing staff is extremely nice and usually I can find an appointment within two weeks time.  A lot of the records are available through an online portal and Dr. Banooni is a very nice and kind doctor.  The down sides are: the wait times are long.  The record keeping is not great.  The parking is expensive.  I ended up switching doctors right before birth because a lot of hidden charges appeared on my billing for the birth.< /text>

<Review>Dr Banooni has been my OB for over 13 years. His staff is incredible, as well. Some have been with him as long as I have been visiting that office, which says a lot about the office. Dr. Banooni is incredibly patient, knowledgeable, kind and an amazing doctor. He’s cared for me in my first pregnancy and now my second. My husband and I always leave that office feeling taken care of and never rushed.

< Review>
My sister and I keep bringing babies to Dr Banooni for prenatal care and delivery. With three complete and one still baking, we trust his care, his advice and his baby extraction process completely. He has a fantastic bedside manner and provides first class care. He keeps the atmosphere light (which I am grateful for, because what patient really wants to talk about a pregnant vagina), but is serious and respectful about questions, concerns and advice. Although I will never look forward to a yearly exam and its speculum goodness, I do look forward to a visit with Dr. Banooni. His assistant Julie and nurse Nora are also fantastic members of his team. I highly recommend him as a doctor for anyone considering becoming a patient.</Review>

Dr. Banooni has been my OB for the last 4 years and delivered both of my babies! We have a great rapport, he listens to my concerns, gives me good advise and doesn't laugh at my alternative medicine desires. I feel like his support allowed me to have the birth's I wanted while also following his own medical guidelines.<//review>

Dr. Banooni is the only doctor who I've seen that deserves a standing ovation of applause and several prostrations. He is on-time, efficient, super kind, knowledgeable, personable and just such a considerate person. He has a patient internet communication service that allows you to see your records and ask questions. I'm so grateful 🙏😁<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Dr.Banooni is an excellent doctor and surgeon. I began seeing him in 2013 to address issues with fibroids and Endometriosis. I had consulted with several other doctors about fibroid removal surgery (myomectomy) and they did not feel qualified for the procedure. Dr. Banooni took on my case with no problem and spent much time listening to my concerns as I wanted to make sure my fertility was preserved. In the hospital after surgery I developed a hematoma which led to another emergency surgery  and Dr.Banooni and the staff at Cedar's took excellent care of me through the entire process. Not to mention, my surgical incisions looked and healed amazing because of Dr. Banooni's surgical expertise and I have seen many other friend's with awful incision scars. Dr. Banooni is still my gynecologist (2018), and continually provides excellent care. At times appointments might be running behind and there is extra wait time, which can be frustrating, but it's because Dr. Banooni actually takes the time to listen and address all concerns in appointments and never gets annoyed, rushes you, or dismisses your thoughts. You might have to wait sometimes, but that time you waited comes back to you when you need it. I have never had any difficulties with scheduling appointments for both urgent. and non-urgent needs and Julie has always been great with helping and it's especially nice that she always remembers exactly who I am.</text>< Pictures>

They are always nice at Banooni’s office since my very first appointment after switching insurances. Sometimes there is a slight longer wait than usual but if it’s for the love of your baby they always make sure you’re informed in the latest with your baby and your health.< /review>

<Review>Dr. Banooni is always a pleasure. He's patient, thorough, takes time to listen, and directly address all questions and concerns; exactly what you want/need from an OBGYN. Oh! And he has a sense of humor, so shooting the sh*t is always fun ;)< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c2b95185af2b5f:0x2ee7a7923b14e24f</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Dr. Banooni delivered our baby girl last month. Through the entire pregnancy and birthing experience, I felt supported and well taken care of by Dr. Banooni and his team. He gave his medical advice and expertise as well as supporting my birthing wishes. It was a great experience and Dr. Banooni has the best bedside manners you can wish for in a doctor.< /Review><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b95185af2b5f:0x2ee7a7923b14e24f</gmap_id>< pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Dr. Banooni is the best and kindest doctor. He handled my ovarian cancer with such sympathy and professionalism. He gave me the diagnosis after he did the surgery. I couldn't have asked for a gentler, kinder, and detail oriented doctor and a very scary time in my life. I owe my life to doctor Banooni, and the Lord led me to him. I am very thankful to have had the BEST doctor available anywhere. Such a blessing!< /Review>< pictures>

<text>When I first found out I was pregnant, I called my insurance to find an OB who took my insurance and they recommended Dr. Banooni. I googled him right after and saw a bunch of glowing reviews and, with my amazing, healthy baby boy in my lap, I completely understand why. After my boyfriend & I experienced a miscarriage last summer with the least empathetic doctor I'd ever encountered, Dr. Banooni was so refreshing. He is calming, knowledgable, communicative, and incredibly caring. We were very anxious and he was always patient and answered our questions, no matter how silly they may have been. Once it came time to push, he was also an awesome support. Our family is moving out of state but I would genuinely consider moving back for our next pregnancy and I would easily recommend him to any friend.</text><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Banooni is ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! I couldn't be more DELIGHTED to leave a testimonial and am honored to do so. I can tell you from the heart and from my experience as a longtime patient(of almost 9 years), that he is truly the BEST in the Beverly Hills/LA area and sets the standard and epitomizes what you'd look for in an OB/GYN.. Firstly, Dr. Banooni is a consummate professional with incredible expertise and talent.. What sets him apart from though from other doctor in this specialty is his COMPASSION-he is truly compassionate in every way: when you first meet him as a new patient you will feel at ease immediately due to his GENTLE, kind, warm, thoughtful manner. and his understanding.  He is incredibly understanding in every way-and he cares for me as a whole person-SO incredibly important- His compassion, gentleness, and understanding is evident in EVERY way he cares for you as a patient. You'll feel it the way he takes the time to fully and deeply hear and address each of your thoughts and concerns, and really every way in which he cares for you as a doctor! I have additional medical issues, having had three surgeries on my spine, and Dr. Banooni's wonderful care of all of the secondary issues that stem from that, and the way he works with my entire team of doctors-and always has is so amazing too...In addition, Dr. Banooni's STAFF are also incredible! They are very kind, thoughtful and compassionate to me. I feel that is VERY important. The office is located on the 2nd floor of a beautiful Medical Plaza, and  the waiting room is very serene, private and comfortable-the inner area where Dr. Banooni's office and the examination rooms are located is very comfortable as well. In so many words, Dr. Banooni is the epitome of what an Ob/Gyn should be in every single way, and I am always very happy to recommend him wholeheartedly!< /review>

Great appointment! It was fast, directly got to my concerns but still Dr Banooni was still very persoanl and hetook the time to explain his thinking (something I value and see far less often than I would like). Also loved that I could book an appointment online. Highly recomend.</Review>

Dr. Banooni is the best!  I was told I could not have a vaginal hysterectomy due to the size of my fibroids ~ not an issue for Dr. Banooni, he changed the location on the scope placement and reduced my recovery to two weeks, instead of months.  He is personable and was willing to spend the time neccessary to answer all my questions.  I don't mind a little wait, when I know the doctor is late because he is taking time with his patients.<//text>

Dr. Banooni is truthfully one of the best doctors I know. After seeing 6 doctors saying I needed a hysterectomy I went to Dr. Banooni and finally felt comfort in my final decision to not do the hysterectomy. I had a myomectomy in August 2017. It was all so scary and the moment I met him I felt comfort and knew it was all going to be ok because I was in the best possible hands. Not only is he a bad a** doctor but he is also an amazing person at heart. Got to know me, asked me a ton of questions and didn't just rush me out of the room. Spent the time with me to make me feel like I was making the best decision for me. Even put up with my calls after surgery lol I trust anything he says, my surgery was flawless, I have had no issues since and a year later tumor free. He is seriously the best and so thankful I was referred to him!<//Text>

I love this man. Am I allowed to say this about somebody other than my husband?! :) Dr. Banooni is kind and patient, knowledgeable and insightful, truly a professional.

I was nervous leaving my previous female doctor (2+ years ago) from the same practice for a male doctor, but she assured me that I would have a great experience with him, and she couldn't be more right. This doctor is one of the most amazing I have ever encountered. He's mild-tempered, not an alarmist, but extremely thorough and I firsthand have seen him interact with other doctors for me on my behalf.

One baby later, I can truly say it's because he guided my husband and I every step of the way. And when it was time to have the baby and I needed an emergency c-section, he was with me every step of the way. AND when I freaked out just moments before the surgery, he held my hand and comforted me, and I knew at that moment it would be ok. And it was.

He also gives back to those who need his medical help, and if that's not telling about the type of person and doctor he is, what is?

I am forever indebted to Dr. Banooni for helping me deliver a healthy baby girl. I will continue to recommend him wholeheartedly to anybody. His staff is great too. I really can't say enough great things.< /text>

<Review>Dr. Banooni delivered our first son and has been my OB throughout the second half of my pregnancy (I transferred from out of state at week 20 and had a hard time finding a physician who would take me this late). My prenatal care was thorough and his bed-side manners are unparalleled. My husband and I had a great experience with him and his office staff (also L&D nurses at Cedars simply adore him which made our delivery team work seamlessly like a well oiled machine). We ricently moved to the Valley but I will keep Dr. Banooni as my OBGYN and am planning on having my second child delivered by him as well.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Dr. Banooni is an excellent doctor, very attentive, understanding and patient. He's been my OB/GYN for over a decade now and I'd never go to anyone else. He answers all my questions, no matter how trivial I think they may be. As such OB/GYN visits can be very uncomfortable, but Dr. Banooni has a wonderful and friendly demeanor that makes all my visits comfortable. His staff is also courteous and friendly and most of the time the wait is not too long either. I recommend Dr. Banooni to anyone who wants excellent care and a trustworthy doctor.</Review>

I switched my OB to Dr. Banooni after it was found that my unborn baby has Spina Bifida (I'm located in Ventura County and was informed I needed to switch care to an OB who could deliver at UCLA, Cedars or somewhere close to Children's Hospital). Dr Banooni has been FANTASTIC in working with me and getting me in touch with all the specialists  that will likely need to care for my daughter  once she is born. This has been such a terrifying time for my husband and I and having a team of kind, caring  & informative doctors has been a major weight lifted.</review>

<text>Dr. Banooni is the calmest and most gentle doctor. He delivered my two children and I continue to see him nine years later. His staff is wonderful and extremely helpful. If you are looking for a wonderful OBGYN you cannot go wrong with Dr. Banooni!< /text>< pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I had a challenging time finding an OBGYN when I moved to LA (one had me giving a sample in key-entry bathroom outside and away from her office. It was not clean.  Not all Beverly Hills practices are the same, that's for sure...) but when I stopped googling and just called Cedars for a rec they sent me to Dr. Banooni.  He's he first doctor to take the severity of my cramps seriously, he came in on a Sunday morning after his kid's soccer game to do a procedure - he really is the greatest.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>If you are looking for an OBGYN look no further. Dr. Banooni is the kindest doctor and really Listens to you. I had the most beautiful birth thanks to him since he knew I wanted to have my baby without epidural. Though that wouldn’t have been his preferred method he respected my choice and it was honestly the happiest day of my life (yes painful :) but magical none the less) I have been going with dr. Banooni for about 11 years now. Couldn’t have a better doctor. Believe me you will feel the same way.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I'm sure there are lots of good Doctors out there, but Dr. Banooni is an EXCELLENT Dr.  I've been seen by Dr Banooni since 2010  and couldn't be more pleased with his care.  Even though I felt hesitant to see a male Dr. back then my point of view changed when I first met him.  His knowledge, kindness, and warm smile makes you feel you are going to be in good hands.  He really listens to your concerns and he makes you feel at ease ( even if you are a nervous wreck) I'm just sorry I didn't find him 10 yrs ago when I first wanted to start a family.. I wasted four precious yrs with a "female" Dr.  however; with the help of Dr. Banooni I now have my precious son and I'm ever greatful  for Dr. Banooni😊.< /text>

<review>I had been going to Dr. Banooni for a few years. Just your standard once a year check up. Never had any issues, he took my insurance, (and I always asked for my labs to go to an in network lab because I have that right!)  for the most part ran on time, is next door to my internist... Until a few months ago. I was there December for my regular check up. No news is good news right?! WRONG!!!! In April at 8 pm I get a call from the dr. He was auditing his charts and some how my abnormal results were lost and I needed to come back in ASAP. I was in so much shock I said I would call back in the am to make an apt. I was a wreck. I have had a few breast cancer scares so I couldn't stop crying and did not sleep that night. I called the next morning and the nurse knew who I was and said come in ASAP. I came in that afternoon with my mom. I had a number of test and asked if I would be charged. The dr said no. But I let the dr know I was actually upset because 3 days prior Cedars called me and said I had an outstanding bill with them. I had no idea what it was. I have no outstanding bills with anyone! It was from my labs for Dr Banooni in December! $208?!!! How?!?! He sent my labs to an out of network Dr. 😡 Dr. Banooni was so embarrassed and knew he was liable for losing my labs he said "I'll take care of this bill to make it right. Plus the Jewish guilt is killing me." Guess what?! He refused to take care of it. I called once a week. The receptionist (who acted like she was afraid of the dr) refused to let me talk to the dr or he just ignored me in hopes I would go away. I offered to come in, to drive from Irvine where I live just to solve this. Nope. I was told do not come in. Long story short after months of calling to dr make it right, I was sent to collections. Awesome! So in the end I guess he won. I paid the bill and he got rid of me. Absolutely DISGUSTING. So if you want a good OBGYN, go to Dr Scott Serden at Cedars. He takes insurance and respects you.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Time>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I found Dr. Banooni by chance and would not trade him for anything. He is super patient and very professional.
This year I had several complications with some cysts and we were finally able to solve it.
I recommend it 100%.
