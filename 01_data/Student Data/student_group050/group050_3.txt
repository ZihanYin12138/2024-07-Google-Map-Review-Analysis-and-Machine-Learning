Nice place.  Took a bit longer then it should. I went back but it looks like they are now closed.  So I went to the other nail spa around the corner and they are just as good.</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Amazing job by the older man on acrylic application and by the woman with shorter hair on fine-tuning and gel color. They were very friendly and took care to make sure we got exactly what we wanted. The woman even redid my thumbs to make sure they were all quality pieces. Every other place I've been to has cut me somehow but they didn't! So happy with our visit!<//text><gmap_id>0x80c29b0b32c08e87:0xb3681e80ad0a7c75< /gmap_id>< pictures>

The quality of work is so poor! I waited over 30 min for my appointment that I arrived on time for. My nails had rough edges and chunks of acrylic left on my nails, no second coat of paint, polish was painted on sloppy, no treatment or trimming cuticles, and my fingers hurt!

When I told the manager this and asked to not pay full price because the quality was poor and showed her the issues, she gave excuses saying “that’s how acrylics are” but never anywhere else had it been this way for me.

She said I had to remove the nails to not be charged and I had no more time so they had my nail polish removed and clipped aggressively leaving my fingers in PAIN. I wasted 2 HOURS in that place, you may, too.<//review>

I hate to give  bad reviews. But I think the woman who did my pedicure really jipped me. When I went in there I was holding my baby. And I think she gave me a pedicure that made me have to pay more money. The pedicure went from $19 to $33. She had some really good cream that made my calluses on my feet really soft. However I don't think that it was right of her to increase the price so drastically and didn't even do that much to my feet.< /text>

I went in for a buff and shine! I’ll never go back.

Their sterile blue packs were open. He did not use a clean pack on me. I didn’t want to fuss but then the rest of their service sucked too so now I feel stupid for not saying anything early on.

I showed him my one finger nail and told him to file all of them to look like that one. He forgot to file my nail at all. When I told him, he said he didn’t want me to be mad if he filed my nail! WTF? I went in to file my nail.

He ended up doing a HORRIBLE job filing my nails. I kept telling him my nails aren’t round, they’re unequal and messy. He kept saying he doesn’t want to file too much of my nail. I don’t know what his problem was and just prayed that it’s the language barrier. I took the nail out of his hand and filed alll of my nails myself. I’m still confused by what happened and what was so confusing.

I get my nails done all around the world at least once a month. I’ve never worked with someone so oblivious and Uninterested in just filing my nails. I’m very offended that I had to file my own damn nail at a nail salon.

They quoted me $13 since this is their manicure price. But ended up charging me $16 because buff and shine has overcharge? He spent a total of 12 min of me, there’s usually a discount, not an overcharge. This is the only place that did that.

I’m very upset, unpleased, and hurt. I feel like I got ripped off. No wonder their store was super empty and they could take me last minute.

1 day later two of my nails are broken. This has never happened before. I’m not even doing anything as I’m on vacation.</review>

i started acrylics in march and i've been looking for a place that's reasonable for me to stay at instead of changing all time. this salon is excellent! the techs really pay attention to the nails and shape, especially when i get fills. every other place i had went to had cut me and my mom would tell me to change salons. this place is absolutely great. the service is great so it's the staff. for a young girl who doesn't make money at all, it's very reasonable for me. i enjoy the environment as well. i'm so glad  i tried it out!< /Review>

It's aiiiight. I came on Sunday and it was packed but nobody was doing their nails and I wanted a new set of acrylics so I was just waiting around for like five minutes. The guy that did my nails was missing a thumb but he seemed competent and cooperative so it was chill. Throughout the process I would check my nails and noticed one of my nails were crooked but didn't say anything because I thought he'd fix it, just file it to make it even or whatever which to some extent he kinda did but you can still tell it's crooked. When he was painting my nails, I accidentally touched the towel with my pinky and that I told him was wrong so he fixed it by moving the polish around and blended it. On top of that I assumed he was gonna use gel polish but he didnt and my nails look lumpy from close up. There's also imperfections all around and basically if you see something wrong you should point it out or else they won't fix it even if it's obvious af.< /Review>

I usually go in to get my eyebrows done, did that came out well. Had a basic Mani and pedi, empty house I was like the only customer there and I asked just to get my nails cleaned up a mani with no nailpolish and a pedicure. The men doing my did not know what they were doing. I am sooooo disappointed in their work . I will only get my eyebrows done there since they can't do a simple French tip or file my nails evenly ? Or at least leave them looking similar?!!! I left angry and upset bit of course they didn't care . I received a service so I paid but will NEVER GO BACK for other than a simple brow wax.</Text>

They have huge signs welcoming visitors and saying they would like to see me again. However when I got to the parking lot, they informed me that I was not allowed to be there and it was private property and "visitors" is another word for "employee." I explained that those two words are in fact different, and they requested that I leave because apparently I was not a visitor.< /review>

<Review>I'm reaching out on this platform to see if anyone knows if the plant has been bought out.  I wanted to assist and see if I could be of service to the hard working employees that might potentially be losing their jobs.  I work with people in transition from one job to another and can advise and guide them through this process.  Appreciate any point person to go to in this regard.  Thank you.< /Review></record>

<Review>01-05-2018
Not enough signage to really help the driver know what lane to be in. (Left lane to scale coming in).
Gate people disinterested in truck drivers was my feeling. Check-in window at docks the gal was helpful.
Scale at the docks is registers under weight my guess is about 500 pounds.
When I told security, the man at the exit gate seemed angry when i reported my tandem axles were at 34200.
Not too much but my steers showed 11100.
That's when the flags in my brain went up. My girl tanks were almost full and the steers generally weigh in at 11700.
This is a legacy operation akin to Safeway or Del Monte or the old businesses that have been around so long they cannot operate efficiently like say Costco DC and some of the newer places that do not hold the driver up 5 6 or seven hours for a twenty minute job.
(Big sigh)
They took one pallet off the back, I'm all better now.
Still, 5 hours to load...
Just saying.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Arrived early to get loaded, waited 6 hrs, then overweight on scale, reworked +2 hrs. All this for .38 cents a mile 😳. I made $38 dollars today, and they wonder why there's a driver shortage 🤔<//text>

My first time here so wasn't sure what to expect based on some previous reviews from other truckers. The guy at the g/s was very friendly and courteous and I was in and out within an hour with a preloaded trailer. They dont have an axle scale but you can scale with your steers, drives and trailer separately on their scale and just do the math.< /Review>

The guards at the shack don't seem to care about drivers and tend to get pissy when you ask them questions. I do a dedicated account so everything there for me is drop and hook. There are very little signs telling you where to go for what you need, so be sure to ask the guards what the procedures are and where to go to check in to get loaded or unloaded. From what I seen it takes hours to get loaded, and I believe this is a union shop, which explains why it takes hours to for them to do anything.<//Review>

< Review>
Employees are some comfortable with their jobs that they forgot how to work. Was here 5 hrs to unload some empty pallets and bulkheads. Guy unloading for 5 hrs spent 2hrs and 45 minutes on smoke breaks<//Review>

Everyone has been so nice to us! Our company didn't have the bills for the load we picked up and Miller allowed us to stay out front to wait for them. Thanks Miller Coors!!</Review>

Confusing place to get around. Spent six hours waiting for a door, now I'm hearing attacks least that to get loaded. My company is great with paying detention so it's really just getting paid to sleep for me, but for other companies or O/Os, this would be a horrible place.</text>

<user_id>108665770342356763147</user_id><Text>First thing the security guard asked me was do you have any pants? I said no it's summer I only have shorts! He said then we can't load you and rudely rejected and sent me away! I had to go to the nearby Walmart to buy pants! Ok, problem solved no big deal! I go back one hour later and the same guy checks me in and makes fun of me saying "other guards don't enforce it but I do!" Meaning that if I had being check in by another guard I wouldn't have to waste an hour of my time and $ to buy pants! Anyways, he then instructed me to go pick up separators and bulkheads and put them in the trailer and wait for dispatch to call me. 3 hours later dispatch calls, I get a door and set up the bulkheads and separators. 4 hours here and I'm barely getting loaded. This wasn't a good experience for me! I hope I never have to come back here.</Text><username>JesseMnz<//username><Gmap_id>0x80c2d812eb1b80f9:0xa80e44a2799e7686< /Gmap_id>< Rating>

Slow: arrived for 10:00pm appointment, load not ready for >14 hours. Shipping tells security staff nothing. Scale at shipping dock is uncalibrated and shows too heavy. When you are loaded too heavy the shipping staff will refuse to unload overage until you get a scale ticket and are directed to go off site. Luckily there are scales at the security gate and security will call shipping if you are over total gross. They will not scale by axle here however.< /text>

Horrible for me I've been waiting almost 4 hours for them to start loading since I've been backed into a door five and a half since I arrived and checked in at the guard shack. I'm only tapping a star cause it won't let me post my comment without a rating</Review>

That place is ridiculous, arrived early just to wait 2 hours to get a door, then sat another 3 hours to even begin to get loaded. I hope not to deal with them again.</Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) This is one of the worst places to upload or download, spoiled disorganized. But what can you expect if those who serve you are not employees, not that they are billionaires disguised as workers, or they will be workers who think that they are the owners ". A unionized = inoperative

(Original)
Este es uno de los peores lugares para cargar o descargar, malcriados desorganizado.  Pero que se puede esperar si los que te atienden no son empleados , no que va esos son multimillonarios disfrazados de obreros, o serán obreros que piensan cque son los dueños " .A sindicalizados= inoperantes<//Text>< Pictures>

So thankful for Sabor opening up in San Rafael! I’ve gotten take away twice now and have not been disappointed. The carne asada was delicious as was the chicken taco. Tonight  I got the chicken burrito. Before I finished I was thinking about when I can come get my next one. It is flavorful, fresh, and filling. Make sure to hit up this local
gem for delicious eats.</text>

<Review>Wow! I usually don’t write a review right after eating... but my shrimp burrito deserves it! It was so fresh and not too salty or dry! The restaurant was busy so we did take out. And their chips and salsas are very yummy as well especially their green salsa if you like a little kick! The staff are very friendly which is always an additional plus! We will be back!!!<//Review>< pics>

<review>This place is amazing, and they have great customer service.

We've never had a good Mexican restaurant in San Rafael, and always had to drive to Novato, or into San Anselmo,

This place is much better than both of the places we use to go, and this has pretty much become our favorite restaurant. We've eaten here around 10 times since they opened, and plan to continue coming.

I personally always get a burrito, and so do my siblings. They're always incredible, and sometimes they give you a massive one that you literally can't eat in one sitting haha.

I don't ever give reviews, but this place deserves it! Not that they need it look at all there amazing reviews.< /review><GmapID>0x808599f80c93091b:0xebbb1931054cb699</GmapID>< user>

So happy to finally try Sabor A Mexico - it was delicious! I got my son a burrito and myself a Chile Relleno plate. My 10-year old son said, “this burrito is different but I love it.” My relleno was spicy, fresh, and delicious. Can’t wait to go back, eat outside, and try more things. Great addition to San Rafael.< /review>

I enthusiastically recommend this local Mexican restaurant.  The chips and green salsa are great.  They have 5 types of street tacos ($3) and I'd recommend getting their carne asada taco.  The staff was warm and served my table well.  I plan on going regularly to this new place. iViva México!<//text>

Read about Sabor a Mexico in the local MarinIJ.

Their story is what sold me to try their spin of authentic flavors found in their dishes.

The ordering process was smooth and simple.

I was very pleased with their customer service. I spoke with a young woman who helped me throughout the entire process.

I ordered the 3 dish combo

2 chile rellenos

1 taco de carne asada

With refried beans and rice.

I added a taco de carnitas.

To complete my order, I included a burrito with pollo asada, rice, cheese, and beans.

I trusted the cook to complete my order.

Unfortunately upon arriving home, I was missing 1 of my Chile’s Rellenos.

The food was very delicious so I was a bit disappointed that I couldn’t enjoy it entirely.

I would give a 5 star review if my order was complete.

But overall, everyone in Marin must at least try Sabor a Mexico!

<text>A lot to like here! Family owned and operated, great food and good service. Carnitas is excellent, we order that everytime. Not a huge mole fan until i tried the mole enchiladas here...again order this everytime now. The mariscos rancheros is also very tasty. Green is creamy texture (but no cream in it) and has a nice jalapeno flavor. Solid guacamole. Highly recommend this local gem.< /text>< Pictures>

< review>
What a gem of a family restaurant! My family and I have ordered takeout from this place twice, and have loved every plate that we've ordered. The mariscos rancheros are to-die-for and my personal favorite. Husband loves the carnitas. Kids also love the carnitas and the carne asada. The floutas are delightful. The mole - wow. I didn't even know I liked mole! The salsas are home made and delicious. The green jalapeno salsa is unlike anything I've had. The family and wait staff are incredibly nice, warm and welcoming. We can't wait to go back and try more!</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>This evening we dined “al fresco“ at the newly opened Sabor de Mexico in San Rafael - it was FANTASTIC! They seemed to have a new twist on old favorites and some new dishes I plan to come back for. I chose the 5 tacos to try 5 different meats and each was excellent - so fresh, so clean and so delicious: Pastor, Carnitas, Shrimp, Salmon and Lengua served with a green grilled onion, grilled jalapeño and radish slices. The salsas were quite scrumptious, make sure to try the creamy (vegan) green salsa - so good. We had an appetizer, I forget the name, which were like lightly fried empanada rolls stuffed with cheese and vegetables with a different sort of fresh green cilantro salsa, they too were great. Solid 5 stars with excellent customer service. Make sure to meet the owners Hegal and Milton, such nice guys and Hegal is a wealth of information about the origins of all the different dishes - not to mention his grandmas mole sauce!</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Amazing authentic Mexican food , great price for delicious food. Our waiter was extremely helpful in answering questions about the menu items and she was so nice! The arroz con leche is a must have dessert. The horchata was amazing, and so were the carne asada tacos. I look forward to going again and would recommend this restaurant to everyone !< /Review>

<rating>3< /rating><Review>Food was very delicious, authentic (I used
to live in Japan), and presentation was beautiful. They even use authentic Japanese-style dinnerware.

Wait and customer service- not so great :/ We were seated outside and waited over an hour for our food. We had to ask for refills. Maybe it was slow because of Mother’s Day?</Review>< Pics>

We eat at Qimura at least once a week. The sushi is so delicious and fresh. The other menu items are also fantastic. Year after year it’s the best! Highly recommend this restaurant. The owners are wonderful and really care about what they do. They want you to be happy and we always are. Love this Japanese restaurant.</Text>

< Review>
Good sushi but TERRIBLE customer service. I was put on hold for more than 20 minutes to place a to-go order. I finally hung up and called them back and told them they had forgotten me. They finally took my order. But that was not an isolated incident. This happened several times. I was always, always put on hold and the last time, when they didnt get back to me after 5 1/2 minutes, I just hung up. I guess they don't want my money. I wonder how much business they've lost by treating customers in this disrespectful and ungracious way. I've now given up on them completely. Perhaps if you dine inside, you may (or may not) get treated better, but I'm not giving them anymore of my business.</Review>

<text>This is absolutely the best Japanese restaurant in Windsor. Umé is usually way busier and more popular but I am not quite sure why. The sushi is way better here. It is also cheaper. I've never felt crowded in the open spaces of this restaurant. The motif is modern and elegant and looks like it would attract a trendy crowd. Everything about this place is simply amazing. So if you are in the mood for 🍣 look no further and head here, you will be glad that you did.<//text><Name>Ralph Hershberger</Name>< Rate>

< Review>
First time here and the food was delicious. I was craving sushi and this is one of few Japanese restaurants in Windsor. The ambiance is nice, the waitress was very sweet and accommodating. The food was delicious. Was hoping for a few more pieces in the roll. It was really good. My fav Jap restaurant is Toyo. But this is a great place here in Windsor.< /Review>

I've been there 4 times now I believe. Great food, good memories every time. Family operated. Rarely, the comanaging couple have their baby strapped to their chest as they manage the restaurant. It never cried when I was there, and the parents seem so sweet. Definitely trying to go back when I have the proper group, or want to get ritzy; yet, it is somewhat decently priced for sushi.< /review>

<Review>This is one of my favorite places to eat. The sushi was great. The ramen was great. The service was friendly but a little scatter brained. The food rose above that. Priced accordingly but not outrageously. Definitely the best option in this shopping centers.<//Review>< pictures>

This is a nice place to go when you were looking for basic sushi and good prices. There is nothing over the top extravagance but then you are not paying over the top prices either. The food is fresh and the staff is new but so is the restaurant. They are working things out and most times it is a great experience. We were a big fan of the previous owners and previous restaurant so it took some time to adapt but they are doing their best and doing a good job. The only thing I would change is that when wines are opened at night sometimes they get left overnight to be poured the next day, and I'm a wine snob, so this bothers me. I do not like day old wine.< /Review>

Food was great. Try the miso. Rock star rolls are the best. Ambiance could be better same with the furniture and a little luxury and this place is 5 stars,<//Review>

The ramen is the best I've ever had. The sushi was extremely fresh.

They updated everything about the restaurant and it has a very chic feel to it.

Very pleased with service.<//text>< Date>

Very sad this resturant replaced Senju, which used to be in the same building. None of the food tastes good enough to be worth the money. Everything is either too oily or too dry. My gf got some kind of noodles and for some reason they tasted like bad, monotonous pizza? Everyone at the table tried some and for the life of us we couldn’t figure out why it tasted like that. I had some disappointing sushi. Nothing is really noteworthy. Just below average to the point where I can confidently say that I’ve made better food at home. At least the fish here didn’t get me sick. The interior is pretty boring and lacks any spark of personality. Sure it looks clean and modern but it’s just a sad room to be in.

Honestly I might be more harsh on this resturant because it replaced an absolutely wonderful and lively place with a lovely atmosphere and amazing food and service that I’d been enjoying since I was young. Because of this you can take my review with a little grain of salt.<//review>

Oh my gosh, this place was outstanding. When we arrived it looked dead, so I worried it might be a reflection of the quality of the food. We we're SO wrong. The food was phenominal and the owner Amy was super friendly. We shared the Ocean Roll and it was loaded with fresh fish, no soy or sauce needed. The miso was the best I've ever had. Hey husband had the pork ramen, also out of this world. I can only imagine everything on the menu is just as good. We look forward to making this a regular spot for us.< /Review>

Qimura is new sushi restaurant in Windsor, it is in the same location as the closed Senju restaurant. We tried it after we received a flier advertising the change in ownership, and we weren't disappointed.
We sampled multiple nigiri, including sake, hamachi and unagi, plus had the sashimi plate that included maguro. The sushi was first class and very well prepared.

We returned to Qimura today, and while the sushi is still very good, the service was extremely slow. We counted 8 staff all hanging around trying to look busy, but waited about 40 minutes for our first roll to be served. I don't think this place will survive unless they figure out how to speed up the sushi making.< /Text>

It's an ok place to go shoot indoors, ok  place overall.  But if anyone wants to go here and park in the back, make sure you don't park in the handicap area without placing the handicap place card.  I forgot mine yesterday and didn't display it on the car while parking.  I'm not sure who it was but one of the workers he saw me on cameras not place the handicap place card and made me go move my car and even told me he can call the police.  My 72 year old father was with me too, and I even informed the worker there, that we have the place card and that we just forgot it, and he did not care.  I told him it's ok if parking enforcement comes to give me a ticket, since I forgot the card, this is not a problem they should worry about.  I am a customer coming to pay them and give them business and did not expect to have a problem over a small issue like this.  If you look at the other reviews as well, all of the 1 star reviews Have to do with poor customer service, if this many people are complaining then obviously something isn't right.  I'm surprised the owners of this business still keep around jerk staff like these.</Text>

Great range for serious shooters.  Very clean and nice range.  They have 14 lanes so you are more then likely not going to have to wait even when they are busy. Really nice and knowledgeable staff. Also great if you want to rent a gun, they have a wide selections I choose from.  Overall a great place to shoot.</review>

<rate>4</rate><review>Enjoyed a fun afternoon at Firing Line with my relatives. We brought our own guns but used FL's ammo. Location has a basic setup with the necessary features. Variety of target printouts for sale at decent prices. Range itself is dated and could use some treatment to reduce the noise level, but overall it is fine and does the job. I'd go back if I was in the area again.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Went today and i had a pretty pleasant experience. Staff were friendly and courteous and the range itself was not bad at all. However, this is an indoor range and they allow the use of bare lead, unjacketed ammo, which is a major health hazard in an indoor range, and the ventilation system isnt all that great. Great first experience here, but i probably won't be returning as i feel my lead levels would probably skyrocket from coming here consistently.</Review>< pics>

If I had the option to leave zero stars, I would have. By far the worse service and treatment at any range that I've ever been to (my military ones included). In my opinion, it's worth the 25 minute drive for Oak Tree Gun Club - best range I've been to here.< /Text>

< Review>
This place is VERY unprofessional. I went in with my dad today expecting to go in with him. I had been to this place before ( about half a year ago ) and was treated really nice, and even been told to come back whenever since I wanted to learn how to handle different types of guns properly. This was my second time going back with my dad who had been coming to this range for around 20 years. The moment we went in I immediately felt the worker target my dad as if he was some sort of danger. He gave us a "safety check" that the guy before us didn't do. They asked him to treat the ammunition in the gun as real ammunition and to unload a loaded gun without breaking any safety regulations. The worker loaded the gun and my dad unloaded the gun facing the ground and gave him the bullets. The worker proceeded to tell him to "try again and remember that everybody in the room counts". He did it again the same way, just more attentive to the way he was doing it as he didn't think there was anything wrong with the way he was unloading the gun. The worker then accused him of "pointing the gun at him TWICE" and kicked us both out saying he couldn't rent out a gun for us. There are no written rules and there wasn't a manager to talk to when we requested it. He kept repeating the same phrase over and over about pointing the gun at others. After going to this place for over 20 years we would never come back. The place discriminates, targets, and has staff that has no knowledge about how to treat its customers. Even if something had been wrong with the way the gun was held, a proper certified instructor would have explained the mistake before the second attempt was made. We had never had a problem like this before so it was extremely disappointing to be treated this way. I would give this place negative stars if I could.< /Review>

A great place for locals to go without having to drive too far. The place has a very welcoming atmosphere and excellent staff.14 lanes total split between 2 rooms (7 & 7). A decent selection of the most popular handguns for rental. This is the best indoor range I have been to in the area.
One caveat; the weekends can get busy and packed at night. Unfortunately, that is when the yahoos go so there can be a lot of inexperienced, ignorant, and foolish people in groups (not cleaning up their brass, not following safety/range rules, puffing up and trying to look cool, especially if a girl happens to be in the room or just outside the viewing window). At least they don’t tend to stay long.
Any time I have seen the range officers do have to remind someone of the rules/policies, they always do so politely and with respect.<//text>

<user_id>113311115017766936834</user_id><text>Terrible business practice here. Really unfortunate I have to write this review as I was a big fan of the Northridge location. Following the outbreak of Covid the company made the decision to close it's Northridge location. This was after I had purchased a yearly membership at the tail end of January. This means that I was able to use a whole 1.5 months of my 12 month membership before they closed the Northridge location. I completely understand why this happened however it is what followed that causes me to write this review. After finding out the information on closure I contacted the Burbank location by phone 3 times. All 3 times I explained that the two locations left open would be too far for me to travel to and requested a refund of my yearly membership. I was even fair and offered to have them deduct the 1.5 months i was able to use the membership from my refund. I was told I would need to speak to the manager and each of the 3 times the manager was conveniently unavailable. I was told I would receive a call back which I never did. I then proceeded to send multiple emails to the management at the Burbank location and again, no response. I ultimately had to file a dispute through my credit card company and have now finally received my money back. Absolutely terrible business practices and customer service. If you as a company make the decision to close a location then be prepared to deal with the fallout and possible refunds. It's so disappointing that instead you made the choice to cower and ignore any kind of responsibility you have to your customers.

TLDR: Location I frequented closed due to Covid. Management refused to  respond to any refund inquiry on my membership. Had to file credit card dispute. Avoid this range.</text>< pictures>

Knowledgeable, helpful, safety-conscious staff.  Not crowded on a weekday.  Rental gun selection is not as good as at LAX range or LAGC.  Prices about average.  Range reload ammo was good, unlike LAX range's.  Typical length for an indoor range, 50 ft(?), so although they allow long guns there would not be much point.  +1 for being one of few shooting-oriented businesses I have been to lately that does not ostentatiously advertise a certain noxious far-right organization.<//Review>

Excellent facilities, fair prices, solid rental selection, and most importantly, a safe and friendly atmosphere.

Their membership is an excellent deal and it is wonderful to have such a great business in the LA County area. Other ranges in the area have extensive waiting lines and have way too many first time shooters with questionable safety practices. Even experienced shooters from outside CA find this range to be exceptionally well-run and well-priced.<//text>

IMPORTANT: This is not a range for beginner! Lots of ppl got offended and frustrated in the google review because they don’t know how to handle a weapon safely and properly and got kicked out by the owner I assume.

I will certainly recommend this range.</review>< Pics>

<review>Poor. Not many choices of rentals, expensive. Staff seem like they’re not in the mood to work.

Facilities seem sub-par.

Best take your business elsewhere.

I wasn’t expecting the quality and level of a Texan range but still disappointed.

At least there is parking at the back.</review>< rate>

Five stars because they are friendly about bringing your own ammunition. Staff are great. Rental guns are good and the place is not a mess. I liked it. I walked out without feeling like I got ripped off like I feel when I go to the downtown LA gun club. After coming to firing line, I will NEVER go back to downtown gun club.<//Review>

<text>After 7 or 8 years of visiting various shooting ranges, I will say this is the indoor shooting range in which I feel the safest seeing as to how they ask every nonmember to demonstrate their firearms safety conduct. If you fail the safety demonstration, they will politely but firmly ask you to leave (so you don't end up endangering other shooters). Before visiting this range, be sure to fully understand and fully obey:
1) The firearms safety rules as outlined by Jeff Cooper
2) The range rules for The Firing Line found on their website
3) How to safely operate any firearm you plan on renting from or bringing to the range

Additionally, their annual membership is reasonably priced and pays off after 9 visits, or 7 visits if you rent one handgun per visit. The range itself is in a good, reasonably accessible location for people living in Los Angeles County, Pasadena, and far east as Rosemead.

Parking: They have 7-9 parking spots in a lot behind the shooting range. There is also street parking very close to the range. Parking was never an issue for me for all of my visits. This shooting range is more busy on the weekends, like most businesses and establishments.

I will end on what I feel is the most important note and I wish there was a way I could emphasize this more but: I am consistently blown away by the professionalism and friendliness of all staff members with each range visit on any given day of the week. This is one of the few ranges where I feel genuinely welcome.</text>< UserId.>

Staff is friendly and helpful. Membership fees are reasonable. Good selection of rental guns. Range is dated but clean. Only negative thing is the ventilation/AC sucks. If you're going in the summer, expect to leave all sweaty. It gets hot and stuffy in the shooting lanes. Other than that, I enjoy going to this range, bought the membership and will recommend to friends.</Review>

Great range. The service is top notch and the facility is run professionally. They split the range in half, so that cuts down on the noise of this indoor range. The yearly membetships arr also reasonably priced and offer lots of benefits. Great place to have fun and get some practice in.<//Text>

Good selection of rentable firearms. Plenty of ammo, targets, and shooting supplies you can buy. Clean bathrooms. It's a smaller range with a small parking lot, so it does get full at times. So if you have a group of people, check their busy times to avoid waiting time. Definitely recommend you try it.< /review>< Pictures>

<response>None< /response><Text>Just a great place to go and shoot. I am a member and the staff is always cordial to me. I've shot at other places and they are tops among them.  They do take precautions when people who don't necessarily know how to handle a gun properly, I don't mind that.
I do like that they generally aren't that busy of a place for the times I go. Some other places have a waiting line to shoot.
Their reloads are priced fairly, but I bring my own ammo now.< /Text>< user>

Guys working there are nice but correctly prioritize safety over everything else including nice and friendly. Only issue is other ranges have digital controls that let you know exactly how far your target is. Not a big issue, but it would be nice.<//Text>< Pics>

Don't expect to have fun in this place. I went there thinking that I am going to rent a firearm and use it in the firing target line but they apparently don't rent. It is just a place for people who have their own firearms to come and train. Ok. Never mind but please mention this in your website.< /text>

<Review>Did a short handgun course here today and had to write the review because of the number of low score reviews already here.
I don't have any experience of other shooting ranges in the U.S., but the staff were friendly, the course helpful, and the safety precautions seemed to fit with a place for firing live ammunition.
I don't get why some people seem to take issue with requiring a high standard of safety.
As someone who doesn't have guns readily available, I felt like I was in good hands and would happily return here, and hope to do so.
Thanks guys.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< UserId.>

About customer service all these gun places are the same... these guys deal with guns- most are cocky and arrogant.
I've been a member for years, and I usually, for the most go to the Burbank location and I've noticed a transition where the guys are much friendlier now... and the rules are stringent FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Text>Lanes are short.  I wouldn't recommend any shooter that has had 3 months on a public line to waste their time.  It's ok for new shooters as long as you don't have to hear a lecture about their inner doors from the general manager when the place is empty.  My LA buddies all told me there are better ranges for handgun.  I should have listened to them.<//Text>< Pics>

I've only been there once but I think it's a nice compact indoor firing range to practice. I arrived around 1:00pm on a hot, muggy day & had no issues with the staff being rude/mean. In fact, when I arrived, one staff member was in the parking lot helping a young patron roll-start his stick-shift car! I purchased a few targets, used my own .45 FMJ & had a great time. I'm seriously considering becoming a member.</text>

Great facility. I go often with my family and the staff is always nice to us. They have a huge inventory of rentals including shotguns and handgun caliber rifles. I've seen a few bad reviews from beginner shooters wanting to learn how to shoot, saying they won't teach them. Range officers are not instructors! Sign up for a beginners class to learn safe handling BEFORE you try to stand next to my family with a firearm you don't know how to handle. I don't have a membership yet but will definitely be purchasing one for my family.< /text>

<text>A-holes. Refused my business on the grounds that I was a danger to their customers. What happens to teaching you how you use a weapon? Not here. Was sent packing by some piece of sh** with attitude. Never again. A beginner wanting to learn the proper techniques and willing to pay for it. forget this place.

This use to be a great place to shoot.  I moved out of town, so hadn't been in a few years.   It is no longer even a decent place to shoot.  The service and attitude of the staff was incredibly condescending.  The prices are higher than average.. and in short... I did not enjoy my time there.  10 years ago, I use to go in atleast once or twice a week... but now, I have no plans on returning  until changes are made to the staff.< /Review>

<Text>First timer and they allowed us into the range alone without any information except how to load the clip. So confused how they treated us when I told them we didn't know anything about firing a pistol. I asked the neighbor for instructions and next thing you know, they claimed I turned around with a loaded gun in hand and confiscated everything from out party and kicked us out. The gun was pointed at the paper the whole entire time. Complete negligence on their part, refusing to instruct and take care of first timers.</Text>< Pics>

10/28/15 first time at this location. Didn't catch the names of the two guys working but they were fantastic. The range was clean as you'd expect, there was no weird "safety check" that I had to go through either. Answered all my questions about guns with a smile, and even re-locktited my front site for free, and lubed the gun before I left. Excellent experience overall.</Review>

Like this place! Saw in a previous review that you can't bring your own ammo. Not true, as long as its FMJ you are good to go. Like all gun ranges, they get negative reviews from people with no shooting experience and the inability to demonstrate they can safely handle a gun getting turned away. Really?! I sure don't want someone next to me that has no clue what they are doing. Staff has always been pleasant to me. Only negative is that the range could be a bit brighter.</review>

<Review>My first time handling a gun, now days you got to be able to protect yourself. I was so nervous since I had never even held a gun before. Luckily my husband is a registered owner and was there with me to guide me and help me with the use of the gun. I would definitely recommend you to go with someone who has experience for sure. For a first timer I did good I got rid of my fear and learned a thing or two about shooting. My arms do feel a little sore and my Lower back feels tight from positioning myself to shoot but it was all with it.   Pricing was okay I guess since this is the only place I’ve been to so can’t compare it to anywhere else. The only thing kind of threw me off was how easy it is to get a gun in there and they don’t even check to see if you are the registered owner of that gun or not. Idk kind seemed weird!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Its an okay shooting range. $22 for a 50 pack of. 45 so fair prices but the range could be better. It's muggy and hot inside the shooting area since the ac isn't too great. There's better ranges available.< /review>

I've seen people fail the test they give you here. It's not complicated, but so many people fail to adhere to the basics.  For the safety of yourself and others, if you have never handled a firearm or if you cannot pass a BASIC test you have to take to rent a gun here, ego aside, you should seek instruction from someone. You will be handling live ammo around others after all.

Their safety precautions are why I choose this range.</Text>

<pics>None</pics><Review>Staff is horrible. Customer service is dismal at best. Stay clear of this location. Saftey is definitely not their priority. When asked for help all they would do is snicker and sarcastically/hesitantly give you bad information. As a heads up you may only bring people under the age of 18 if you're 21 or a court ordered "guardian". Funny since the first time I brought someone in a week ago, we were 18/17 respectfully. Guess they never passed elementary school mathematics. In addition a legal guardian has a broad BROAD scope which does include brother/siblings but I guess they were illiterate as well.<//Review>< Time>

Can't give 5 starts because it's not an outdoor range. For a SoCal indoor range, it's pretty good. Very basic. The prominent location attracts a lot of different types of people so they are strict.  Their safety check could be a little better explained up front. It is a very basic check though. Don't muzzle anyone, drop the mag, load a snap cap, insert the mag, load the chamber, drop the mag, clear the chamber.  I passed first time with my wife watching!

They allow pistols, 22lr rifles, and I saw shotgun shells. Can't shoot alone unless you are a member. Don't want any anonymous lone wolf types, you know.<//review>

pistols only. NO RAPID FIRE!!!(found out the hard way, was told I would get kicked out if happens again). if u take Ur own gun n ammo, no steel case ammo-they check. if u rent a gun u must shoot their ammo! for target practice its ok, for fun(safe) shooting,go elsewhere! !!</text>

<text>Been here twice so far maybe 3 times, staff has always been helpful, low pro & cool. Signed up, flowed right in, n got to shooting. Stayed a few hours. Brought my own ammo and guns but its cool u can rent/try something different have to use their ammo for that which is fine. A little pricey to do that vs byo (FMJ) but convenient to have access to different guns on hand. Not something u can just go easily buy to try. Other people all seemed level so no worries there. Got in, went thru x250 rounds had LOTS of fun. Cant wait to go back.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Got made fun of.  I am active duty military and went to go check this place out. My friend decided it was a good idea to go here since I was in town on leave. Once I was inside I was helped my an Asian gentleman. He asked us some typical questions.....have you been here before?, Is this your first time?, Do you have any expirience? Etc.
My friend has none but I told the gentleman I did and showed my military I.D.  He showed me an M9 to start. He said it should be easy just remember what they taught you in bootcamp. To which I said they don't teach you about pistols in bootcamp and that has been a year since I graduated. He then said that since I have no weapons training or knew how to use that weapon then I should just leave. It was a slap in the face as if my service and all my training meant nothing.</Text>

The worst ever customer service and the facility is terrible, the only reason I stopped by because it's close to Costco. They don't have any written rules about anything, and still do some kind of "safety check" without even telling you that it's a safety check. And during this useless check the fake bullet got stuck in their pretty unsafe glock 19. I've been shooting for many years and been to a lot of facilities but have never seen anything worse or more unprofessional than this place. They don't even have a manager that you can talk to and when you ask a normal question about their operation they don't know what to answer or where their rules are written down. I wish I could give negative star to this terrible place, the only star is for the location.< /text>

As I expected, he gave me a story how i failed his biased safe test, when i never pointed gun at anything but floor below, and asked me to give him money for training to become "safe"

Location:
Great location with parking space in the back (about 13 total)

Safety:
.There are no range officer inside the two shooting areas
.There are a lots of beginner leading to a lots of gun miss handling (such as not pointing the guns in the safest direction and not reloading guns in the booth)

Staff:
Customer service is overall mediocre because of their cocky attitudes (stay away from Todd)
Anytime you need help it look like you are annoying them

Ammunition:
You can not bring your own ammunition (except for .22lr)
Their reload ammunitions are really dirty
The ammunition is expensive

Gun:
Good selection of the most commun guns on the market.
Gun are no very well clean which leads to jam from time to time.
No shotgun allowed and no rapid fire</text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The worst shooting range in Los Angeles and surely in the whole of the United States. I shoot in most of the US states but I have never been so disappointed. Firstly no information on the prices, there were 2 of us but can only have one weapon and one line so each take turns, in other words no one. A really poor choice of handgun and even worse semi automatic rifle. The prices are staggering 98 dollars for 2 handguns (a 9mm and a .45) 50 rounds of each or in other shooting ranges it is about 10 dollars the rental of the weapon plus 14-18 dollars for the 50 cartridges. Avoid this establishment if you are not a member and instead direct you towards more "tourist" ranges like the "los angeles shooting club." Highlight of the show he forgets to give us our 2 IDs so let's turn around 25 km to Pick them up. The only good thing is the parking lot. You know every good stay in Los Angeles.

Le pire shooting range de los Angeles et sûrement de tout les états-unis. J'ai tirer dans la plupart des états américain mais je n'ai jamais était autant deçu. Premièrement aucune informations sur les prix, nous étions 2 mais ne pouvons avoir qu'une arme et qu'une ligne donc attendre chacun son tour ,autrement dit nul. Un choix vraiment médiocre d'arme de poing et encore pire de fusil semi automatique . Les prix sont ahurisants 98 dollars pour 2 armes de poing (un 9mm et un .45) 50 cartouche de chaque ou dans d'autres shooting range c'est environ 10 dollars la location de l'arme plus 14-18 dollars pour les 50 cartouches . Fuyez cet établissement si vous n'y êtes pas membre et diriger vous plutôt vers des range plus "touristique' comme le "los angeles shooting club" . Clou du spectacle il oublie de nous rendre nos 2 ID donc faisons demi tour de 25 km pour les récupérer . Seul bon point, le parking. Voilà vous savez tout bon séjour à los Angeles.<//Review>

{'time': 1621443556710, 'text': "Hello Elvera, I was the one who sent you the other frame. I'm so sorry you are having this issue. Please call me at the store and I will take care of this for you."}<//Response>
< review>
Ordered a frame, came pretty fast, but when i received it the box had a giant hole in the side.. still opened it to set it up, looked used, had ton of scratches on it.. wasn’t even wrapped with plastic or foam. was missing an important bolt to hold the frame together... tried to get in touch with customer service al they have is an online form you submit but that’s inconvenient.. called in store and lady ordered me a new one but the frame came completely different than what i originally ordered!!! such a hassle for a simple bed frame. now i have to figure out how to return the other frame and get my money back because this is a waste of my time.

EDIT: Owner reached out to me asap an solved the issue. excellent customer service on her end, i appreciate her quick response and resolution.< /review>

<Text>Went to try out a purple mattress. Anthony was the salesperson at the store that day. I was really impressed with the experience he had. He answered all my questions and trust me I had lots! I didn’t feel pressured into making a purchase. Anthony gave me the time and space I needed to talk with my husband to finally make our purchase. We ended buying a purple 2 mattress with pillows, sheets and a adjustable base. He also honored what ever promotion purple was offering. My bed got delivered and set up. It only took 3 days after purchase for my bed to get delivered. It’s been 2 weeks and we are happy with our purchase! Thanks Anthony for the excellent service you provided us!< /Text>< response>

Such a surprisingly amazing experience! We were not in fact intending to purchase our new mattress when we came in, but simply to try some out in person before we bought online. But Janey was super helpful and easy to work with and just ended up leading us to just the right one. She was extremely informative and guided us to the right deal that we could simply not pass up! She was very patient with us and all of our questions, and truly pleasant to work with. I was so happy to give our business to this store as opposed to ordering online or purchasing from anywhere else. I honestly never would have thought shopping for a mattress could be so pleasant :D Many thanks to Janey for this experience!< /Text>

<Review>I initally went with a cost saving mattress but was assured by my salesmen Romie I had 120 days to see if I liked it. After 105 days I called Romie to tell him I wasn't satisfied.  He immediately responded to my concern and helped me choose a superior replacement for my back issue. I would highly recommend  this salesperson to any of my friends and family. Truly skilled, friendly and went above and beyond to make sure my needs were not only met but exceeded expectations.

<text>The staff was very helpful and kind. They were engaging and interactive while also giving us space and time to try out different mattresses. We worked with Mirko and he answered all our questions and gave us great options. When we did select a mattress for us they worked with our budget to ensure we got the most out of it. I would also like to add that the entire staff was very kind to our 4 year old who was more than thrilled to lay on different beds even giving her a pillow to test beds with. If you’re looking for a good mattress at a great place with peace of mind then look no further. Would definitely recommend to any and everyone!< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5_T-IdzFAT4rkQJAGlcbM5jHZnR9jK1yHhzd2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Janey is great! She was warm and welcoming. Very informative. BF & I came in need of some great pillows. She showed us our options and we got to test them out. We ended up checking out mattresses & she let us lay on different ones. We ended up getting that as well. Haha! Thank you Janey for all your help.</text>

< review>
Today was a very stressful day for me... I have unexpected guests coming out of town... And I had no bed for them to sleep in I had been to several different places they gave me the run-around the prices weren't right... There was a third party involved and I was just so stressed out... Mr. Lewis is a godsend he comforted me he assured me if I just took a breath... Everything was going to be okay and it surely was he sold me exactly what I needed in a timely fashion... It will be delivered at the time I need it.. He truly exceeded my expectations of a Salesman... If I must say he is my son from another mother... I couldn't have asked for a better salesman when I left Mattress Firm I knew I had been to the right place and God guided me through with the help of mr. Lewis... Mr. Lewis I want to thank you again for being such a kind and loving person towards me. God bless you and thank you I'm sure I'll be a mattress firm customer for life</review>

I went to the Richmond Store yesterday and Janey was able to pull up all the beds that we had purchased from there from  2000 on.  Janey was pleasant and helped me pick a bed according to our needs.  I returned the next day with my husband and he agreed with my choice.   We were taken care of efficiently in a half hour with a delivery date two days later.  We were very impressed with the service.<//text>

I came into the store not knowing any knowledge about mattresses beside sizes. Janey E. greeted my boyfriend and I as we entered the store. She gave us a tour around explaining different perks for each types of mattresses. She gave a lot of pros and cons with the details we gave her about ourselves. We ended up taking the best feeling mattress for both my boyfriend and I and got ourselves a purple mattress including the full mattress accessories. Not only that, she fully made sure that the transaction doesn't end there and thoroughly explain the after process when the mattress gets delivered. Overall, my boyfriend and I had the best time and got all the help we needed.</Review>

<Review>I would have given this review 5 stars if not for the first salesman I encountered.
He began by showing me mattresses and bases double what I indicated I wanted to pay, offering me no discounts and claiming the mattresses he was showing me were not on sale. As soon as possible, he dumped me to work with a couple who had just walked in the door.
Note that I'm disabled (I use a walker and had to bring my own stepstool to the store) and walking around the store twice left me in quite a bit of pain.
Lisa, who I had actually asked for based on a friend's referral, took over the sale, showing me a wider variety and when I circled back to a more expensive mattress and base (one that supposedly wasn't on sale), offered me deep discounts on both. I left as a happy (but hurting) buyer. My mattress was delivered within 24 hours and I am looking forward to a great sleep!
Thanks, Lisa!<//Review><rate>4</rate><response>None< /response></record>

Came in while killing time for the car dealership and walked out with a purchase for a mattress made for a Queen (no pun intended). The attentiveness, ease and high-quality saleswoman running the place (Janet Eslick) was by far the reason why I made this purchase today. She listens to all your needs and helped me decide the mattress that I needed and deserve. Thanks Janet! Come here for all your mattress needs and for a saleswoman that knows what shes talking about and no pressure shopping.< /review>

Mrs/Miss Diamond, was truthfully helpful and perfectly kind to show us around. Personally she provided perfect customer service. To the point my lady wants to bring her parents and work with Mrs/Miss Diamond only. Mrs/Miss Diamond, if you aren’t around the clock my lady won’t show up unless you are working hehehe 😂.</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Today I went in looking for a queen mattress for my son. We were greeted by Kashif an employee that works at Mattress Firm. Off top very friendly, very helpful! I mentioned that I had seen a queen mattress online and right away he gave me information that only mattress that are in store are only for looking and trying out none in-store( good thing so he doesn’t waste my time nor his). I show him which mattress I was Interested in, walks me to the same one and moves it so I could see it. It’s perfect for my son! He offers a mattress cover which by the way was a great deal and walk over to get the ball rolling for the delivery. I mentioned that I needed something ASAP, Right away Kashif assured me that the mattress can be delivered by tomorrow (open window time not sure but that’s NO problem) and asks me if I have a mattress that needs to be removed! I did, Kashif said no problem we can remove that for you! So basically I get my queen mattress for a great deal, a mattress protector for a great deal, FREE home delivery, and GREAT customer service, I can say we walked out of mattress firm with a great deal and something not only that I needed ASAP but left a happy customer. I plan on going back to get my Purple Pillow! Thanks again Kashif ! Great customer service willing to explain and having pride in what you do goes a long way!</Text>< Pictures>

My husband and I visited this store and we were immediately greeted by Kerk and Janie. They were very pleasant and welcoming. Kerkorian came over to us and listened to our needs and displayed attentiveness and knowledge of all the products. Event hough my husband and I couldn't make up our minds, Kerk displayed patience and understanding. He did not force a sale on us just to get us out tbe store. He encouraged us to go home and talk about what we need and what we can compromise on and to visit the store again. We came back a week later and Kerk assisted us again. We found exactly what we wanted and needed!! Kerk ensured we got all the best deals and worked with us for the best financing options. I recommend this store for great customer service, cleanliness and professionalism. We will definitely be visiting again!<//review>

My husband and I , was greeted with a smile and the employee that helped us, he was friendly and professional. He made sure to inform us on the best mattress for our son.
I also shared with him that I have a spine injury , so he took me to the best system they had in the store. Let me tell you, It was the best feeling I've had in a long time.
I' m coming back to get that unstable base !
They also have fair prices on their mattresses
My husband and I , recommend that you give them a try , Mattress Firm wont disappoint.😊</review>

We had a great experience with the team at Mattress Firm. Kashif was great, he got a feeling of our desired mattress type, price, and firmness and showed us many different options. We also appreciated him giving us some space to discuss as we were testing the mattresses. He made great recommendations and we ended up with a mattress that we are excited about.

For COVID safety, they gave us our own large paper towels which covered the pillows. They also sanitized the beds with some spray between uses.

All in all a great experience! Looking forward to our mattress delivery soon.<//Text>

<text>My wife and I along with my kids were greeted as soon as we walked in and immediately were met by a gentlemen named Kashif. Kashif was very informative and gave us excellent customer service! He never pressured us to go above our budget and gave us all the options available within that range. Even though they didn’t have the mattress we wanted available in store we were able to order it and are awaiting delivery. Really thankful to Kashif for a seamless service and he was even great with our daughter who was using the store as her play ground lol. I’d highly recommend seeing Kashif if you’re looking for a smooth customer experience.</text><time>1614615776752< /time>< GmapID>

I went in with what I thought was an idea for a mattress that I wanted. Only wanted a specific mattress due to seeing it around online. Moment I showed up I was greeted by Janey. I stated I needed a new mattress and she began with asking me questions about my sleeping patterns/behaviors. This was my first mattress that was not a hand me down that I was going to buy. Janey had me try a few mattresses and found what I believe was the perfect one for me and the way I sleep. I did not get the mattress I wanted because I was shown a mattress that fitted my style of rest perfect. Janey helped me a lot in getting a mattress just for me. Did not have to down grade in size neither. Great customer service and friendly nature.<//review>

Had an awesome experience at the Mattress Firm in Richmond... went in with a certain budget and the sales person Kirkula showed me several mattress, was completely knowledgeable and made sure I was completely satisfied with the mattress I was to purchase. There were a few snags when I picked the mattress I wanted with it being out of stock first, then that was fixed and they weren't able to deliver until October. I wasn't happy, but Kerkcula's customer service was excellent, he was able to get me the mattress I wanted (and it was an even better quality and available), he gave it to me for the price I was quoted and then went above and beyond and waived the installation/delivery fee. If I want to have the adjustable portion added to my mattress later I can do that and best believe I am coming back to Mattress Firm in Richmond, I just hope my fave sales guy Kerkula is available. Excellent customer service and I am looking forward to sleeping on my new mattress... Ordered today, delivered tomorrow ;-)</Review>

Since we walked in the store we where greeted by the two employees that where there. The sales associate Janey Eslick was great. She explained the difference between the mattress. My boyfriend and I really liked how she helped us from beginning to end.  Very happy with our purchase. Can’t wait for us to get the new mattress delivered.< /text>

Janey at the Richmond Parkway Mattress Firm helped me pick the greatest bed today.  She was patient, attentive, and super knowledgeable on all the beds available.  She made my experience tolerable and actually fun.  You have a great asset to you company with her as an employee!!!!</Review>

I had an absolutely Amazing experience. Kerk was a gentleman and his customer service was Extraordinary! It took a while for me to make up my mind and I never at any time felt rushed. I was able to choose exactly what I wanted without feeling pressured into something I couldn't really afford. Thank you Kerk. I will let all of my friends and family know about the great customer service and prices at Mattress Firm.</Text>

< review>
I went into the location in Richmond on 7-1-20 and worked with Kerk on buying my first brand new mattress, and bed set. They were attentive to us from the get go, despite obviously being busy closing out deals with people who had arrived before me. I went in thinking it would be a long, strenuous process, especially during this pandemic, but Kerk worked with me amazingly to make the process seem less. He worked with me and gave me prices that I wasn’t seeing at the other places I had gone. He upgraded multiple pieces I purchased and suggested amazing alternatives when I was not sold on something. I was approved quickly through the finance program and happily walked out quickly after I arrived with a killer deal, and a mattress that would be delivered to me the next day. I am very impressed with Mattress Firm- and especially with Kerk in the Richmond location, and recommend this location to anyone looking to purchase a new mattress</review>

<text>Janey took the time to explain everything! More than once, because my husband came with me and of course we asked the same questions but never at the same time! The store has sanitizer for your hands and PT for the the pillows to lay your head on.
She explained all the different types of mattresses and hybrids and had visual examples of what the PURPLE  mattress was made of. She was polite, funny and sweet. Every person in sales has a verbal routine of each product but I never got the feeling of being "sold" a mattress. Janey's skills are point.
Thank you for a relaxing and informative experience. Really looking forward to our new bed and awesome new base!</text><date>1594053755600< /date>< pictures>

We bought our mattress with Kerk. Was a great experience. Kerk is friendly, professional and patient.

The mattress delivery was just as professional, communicated really well during process.

Ended up returning during the 120 policy for a different mattress. Again we worked with Kerk. He goes above and beyond in customer service,

Highly recommend Mattress Firm in Hilltop.</review>

Soon as I walked into the store the employees were attentive and greeted me took a minute to myself to look around and was accompanied with and saleswomen by the name of Janey which gave me a lot of information and also a good deal on my purchase which came with a free adjustable base that are normally $500 plus a discount on my delivery that includes assembly I know most deliveries are free at your doorstep only. With that being said good experience<//text>

Came in on Sunday 6/7/20 to browse for a new mattress set with my girlfriend. We were greeted by Janey and asked us what we were looking for and she made her recommendations not to mention had us test out some beds. We didn't know our exact budget or what we were looking for. After letting Janey know our sleeping habits and position of sleep we tested the purple mattress and, oh man, such comfort laying on it so we settled for a purple mattress with the adjustable base and we couldn't be any happier with our purchase. Can't wait for our new bed to arrive tomorrow 6/9 so we can sleep on it. Thank you Janey for your recommendation and for taking our sleeping issues into consideration for us to make our choice on the bed!</text>

Diane is legit and helped me find a fantastic deal on a purple mattress, highly recommend this place for anyone who is in the market for a new mattress. They will even price match if the prices get cheaper in the next 4 months for the same model. Also 120 day trial! Cant wait to try out my new bed! Either way fantastic customer service!</text>

When I first walked in my family and I were instantly greeted by Janey Eslick. She understood that buying a  mattress for me was very overwhelming. So she really took her time went around the entire shop and let me sample EVERYTHING. She never once rushed me. Or got annoyed with my daughter who is One and a half that was running around the shop. She made this first time experience for me fantastic. Janey is very knowledgeable to all of the products and different mattresses. She has one of those personalities that can click with just about anyone so it feels like you’re out shopping with your bestfriend. She never pushed a sale or anything on me. And helped me pick out what I really needed the most. Thank you Janey!</text>

We were very happy with the service that was providing by Mattress Firm. Our sales rep Kerkula was awesome!  He was very knowledgeable and answered ALL the questions we had.   I did a little homework before I went in, but I left knowing a lot about mattresses that day.  We didn’t feel pressured anytime we were pressured to buy anything, but of course we did because that’s what we went there for!  We are extremely happy with the purchase we made. Thank you for the great service!

I am giving them a 4 stars because of the delivery service. I am not sure why they call it white glove service. When we asked the installer to lower it he said we should have requested that and reluctantly did it. It literally consisted of screwing off some legs before laying the platform down. Then he wasn’t sure if he was delivering the right bed. He kept on saying it was a cal king when it was a king. Then they gave our mattress cover to the last delivery address.  They went and got it, but the customer had already opened it.  We accepted it not being aware that they had already washed it.  We just kept it, but it was a little upsetting. Especially when we spent as much money as we did and we paid extra for delivery.

Sales rep gets 5 stars and delivery service gets a 2. Advice make sure everything is right before the installers leave and you sign the paperwork.<//Text>

<text>Diane and Connie were a tremendous help with getting our mattresses, two spectacular and insightful individuals with such a wealth of knowledge.

The interior of the store was very clean, with a very large variety of beds, all of which from the most expensive to the cheapest were all of a high quality and quite relaxing too.

Ultimately in the end I can safely assure you, so long as Diane and Connie are working at this particular store I intend fully in future to buy more beds if ever this one get's worn out or breaks.</text>< pics>

Let me start by saying I actually bought my purple mattress from here because of the service after shopping around 5 different mattress locations. Diane and Kerkula are two very knowledgeable professionals that will not rush or pressure you into buying anything. You are always greeted with a smile when you walk in. Them two made my mattress shopping experience that much better!</text>

Janey was joyful, attentive, and patient. We came in unsure of what our ideal mattress would be. We knew of several different brands that have great reviews. Janey helped us narrow down our likes and dislikes. She helped our dream become a reality. If you’re in the market for your own dream bed, go visit Janey.< /text>

Great mattresses!
Diane helped me find the bed of my dreams! She whipped me up a quote within a minute and we had a great conversation that made me feel very welcome to come back. The best part? She didn't feel like a salesman, but more like a best friend who was actually trying to help me find a great mattress.

10/10 would recommend this store over anywhere else!!< /Review>

<Review>I was in the market for a new mattress and came across Mattress Firm Richmond using Google. Mattress Firm offered financing with 0% interest using their Mattress Firm credit card through Synchrony Bank. As far as I could tell, they were the only mattress retailer that had any special financing deals, but their prices were pretty reasonable too. Applying was easy and quick online and got the approval within seconds. If you have no credit or bad credit you could also get financing through Progressive Leasing. The rates are probably higher and doubt they have 0% interest specials, but at least you can finance your purchase.

I called Mattress Firm Richmond to see if they were open and they were. I spoke to Diane and she mentioned that they were open but by appointment only. Diane was extremely helpful and informative. She not only squeezed me into an appointment for the next day but also took a few minutes to listen to what I was looking for and provide me with a little bit of information. Obviously I would get more 1-on-1 service during my appointment but it didn't stop her from taking the time to share her knowledge and expertise with me.

At my appointment, Connie helped me and my wife pick out the right mattress for us. Connie mentioned she was from another store but I'm glad she was there during our appointment. She had us try a few different types of mattresses first to get a feel for the difference in comfort. Our mattress of only 2.5 years old felt like it wasn't supportive enough so we thought we needed a firm mattress. Connie took the time to explain to us the difference between a firm mattress and a mattress with firm support.

Long story short, we settled on a Serta mattress that had firm support and some cushioning. The mattress with a little more cushioning felt more comfortable but we opted to save about $400 so we could get an adjustable base. Note that you can get a free adjustable base with a purchase of $699 and up but it's their basic model. We opted to pay a little more for the Serta adjustable base because it was more quiet and smooth when operating. We've never had an adjustable base so my wife and I are excited to receive our new mattress.

Fortunately, the mattress we selected was in their warehouse so we're getting our mattress within 24 hours. We did purchase during their Memorial Day sale, which is the biggest sale of the year for them aside from Labor Day so I can't guarantee that they'll have the same sales and discounts on their bases, delivery fees or extended warranties. We saved over $1000 and couldn't be happier with our purchase.

Hopefully the mattress works out for us for the next 10 years but we'd definitely look no further than Mattress Firm Richmond for our future mattress needs. Based on my experience, I'd highly recommend them.

Updated 5/20/2020: My mattress wasn't delivered the next day as expected because it wasn't actually in stock even though it showed up as 1. I called the store back and spoke to Connie again. She apologized for the delay but told me that it was expected to be back in stock on Wednesday so I should get it by Thursday. I was a little disappointed but happy to hear that I wouldn't have to wait too much longer to receive the bed. I didn't receive a call to inform me of the delivery for tomorrow but I'm hopeful it will. Fingers crossed and I will provide another update once my mattress is delivered.< /Review><name>Jonathan Nelly<//name><Resp>{'time': 1589985615541, 'text': "Wow, thank you for your glowing review!

This is an older frame, twin, trundle bed. The bottom frame collapses down and slides under the upper frame. We measured everything, twice, yep the one one ought to fit.

Oops. Mr Kerk made a quick phone call, and the warehouse delivered the next smaller twin mattress.

My wife and I just bought a queen mattress for our guest room from this location and couldn’t have had a better experience. We had already decided what kind of bed we wanted from their online store but wanted to try the bed before we bought it. This was one of those cases where a brick and mortar store beats out any online deals as Anthony the store manager hooked us up with a great deal during their Memorial Day Sale.

I would recommend this location to others that would want to purchase a mattress.< /Text>

<review>The customer service at Mattress FIRM was very professional.

We were greeted upon arrival and was assisted by Art.
He provided outstanding service!  We were able to try several mattresses and, he answered all of our questions and concerns with patience!

Thank you Art for your expertise, we really appreciate it.

Oh, forgot to mention that we will receive our mattress tomorrow!<//review>< pictures>

Wow Wow Wow😀👍
I have to start by saying that we loved the customer service from Kerkula Fromayan.  It made the difference in our decision, We were planning to go to other places. We started with Mattress Firm. We loved the experience of shopping here with my fiance, We were more than satisfied with the product that was a Sandbur Firm mattress, adjustable base  and its covers.
Of course the product quality is important but without good customer service I would not return to an establishment, or recommend it.  Without hesitation Mattress Firm has⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ thanks to Kerkula Fromayan< /text>

<pics>None< /pics><review>I moved to Richmond due to a new job and I needed a bed as soon as possible. As a recent young professional, this was my first foray in buying a "real" mattress. I'm glad I went for Sleep Train in the Richmond location. The person who helped me out was Kevin Matthews and he was really great: personable, professional, helpful. He asked me initial questions to get an idea what sort of bed might be right for me. With each bed I saw and laid on, he explained every one of them and how they were different from one another, why a certain type appeared softer or warmer to me, among others. He was very patient especially since I asked to try out a few beds more than two times. He brought up questions I hadn't even considered prior to walking into the store. Kevin made sure to answer my questions thoroughly. Also, in terms of the store milieu, it was very clean, organized, and quiet. Lastly, the delivery was on time and the people who set it up were friendly. My experience of buying my first mattress couldn't have gone better. A big "Thank you!" to Kevin and Sleep Train.<//review><time>1455404085313</time>< GmapID>

<Review>Had a very good experience shopping at this outlet. The salesperson, Kashif, was professional and very knowledgeable. Appreciated that he knew the right questions to ask in order to suit us to the right mattress. Overall, excellent customer service on his part.

The not so good was on the delivery. We were placed in a delivery slot and were told they would call us the night before to confirm a time frame. That didn't happen and we got the automated call the day itself for a time frame of 8-10pm. We then spent the night waiting for them and the call never came until 11:30pm!! We were just moving into our new place and had no beds so this delivery was crucial and they blew it.

Called to complain and they made up by waiving the delivery fee which was appreciated.</Review></record>

I had a wonderful experience at matress firm. My salesperson, George was very helpful and informative. He was attentive without being pushy, a great salesperson.
Unfortunately at no fault to George I think I need to exchange my mattress. It’s been two weeks and I’m trying to give it a fair shot, but I think it’s just too firm. I’m gettimg severe shoulder pain because I’m a side sleeper. I will follow up with a review regarding the exchange.
I hope George is there, but if not I hope to receive the same exemplary service. Let you all know.< /Review>

Salespeople in the Richmond store were very nice, and thus, two mattresses were bought today, thanks to the sale prices, and free electric bases that would lift the head and foot ends of the mattress. Now to wait for the delivery....<//Review>

My hubby and I had a late lunch there today.  The food was excellent!  Best chicken sandwich anywhere!  The pickles are delicious and the onion ring stack was crispy and not greasy at all.  My hubby loved his burger too!  The owner is very nice and friendly and really seems to care about the food he serves.  Great, attentive wait staff too.  I highly recommend Le Col Rouge!</text>

Crispy on the outside, moist and juicy inside and the medium spice level is perfect for me - spicy but not distractingly so. Great sides and friendly service. Just ordered 30 grilled chicken breasts with zero seasoning for an at home event and they were perfect! What a time saver!!</review>< pics>

W O W !!! Out of all of the hot chicken spots I've been to this place is among the top. The chicken, spice, and the crunch were all perfect. Prices are solid too. If you're close by you better try them out.<//review>

The food was delicious. We had great fried chicken tenders, loaded fries, and the redneck sandwich and all was really good. The owner (I think is the owner) has always been incredibly friendly, and the service was great. Lots of seating options, inside, outside and even an area to protect you against the wind but still open. We will definitely be back.< /Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>So delicious! Chicken is always on point with juicy, crunch and spicy levels. Plenty of outdoor dining space! Safe.

If having the best fried chicken, chicken sandwich, fried green beans, fries, and wings in Marin isnt enough reason to come here....the owner is good guy. I dont know him, other than being a regular here. Makes it easy to support this spot.

Sports in tvs and beers in draft. Yummmmy!

Keep up the fantastic food LCR!< /review>< Pictures>

The fried chicken from Le Col Rouge is easily the best in Marin, we love it!

They have great mac and cheese and the fried chicken sandwiches are awesome as well.

Be careful, this place is seriously addicting lol</text>

<Text>Service was great, beer was cold, chicken was hot. Maybe just a bit oily for my personal taste. I have no experience with Tennessee BBQ so I may not be the best to judge it. My favorites were the coleslaw and the pickles.<//Text>< UserId.>

These reviews real?  Very inconsistent cooking.   Your sweet tea may be sweet, or it may not. The chicken might be raw, it might be overcooked. Their sides are dry and bland.< /Text>

I wish that I wasn't too skerd to try the hotter versions of the chicken, there are three: skerd, dang and redneckulous, but thankfully there is a shaker with extra spices to kick up your chicken.

I’ve ordered the food to go. Chicken sandwiches were really good as well as garlic fries. I really liked the peach shake, it was different from my usual ‘vanilla’ preference.
People were very patient with my kids till we were waiting for the food and they helped me to load the food in the car. Thank you!</text>

We went one of the first two opening days.  The place was packed within 20 minutes of sitting down. Thank goodness for the owner coming around to tables because the server we had was not selling us on any of their options. No recommendations and couldn't tell us about the flavor/ different heat levels on the chicken except the names and order of heat:
1) skerd 2) dang 3) redneckulous
Don't be afraid of the heat. If you like flavor with a kick go with the middle option. It's not spicy like you'd think.
The onion rings were delicious.
We ordered a chicken sandwich (skerd)
and a chicken meal with two sides (dang)
The sandwich was dry, it needed something and I wish I would have went spicier.
The chicken meal was good, side of mac and cheese, great!
Nice variety of beers on tap although, no N.A. option, which would be great if that happens!
Seeing how we went opening week, we'll likely give it some time to iron out the rough edges and visit again.
We enjoyed the baseball game on while we ate, chatting with the owner for a moment, and the quick service.<//Text>

My friend and I visited Le Col Rouge on President's Day at around 1 pm. We sat out on the covered patio and were quickly greeted by our server.  We both decided to have a mixed greens salad with chicken.  She ordered hers grilled,  and I got mine with Parmesan cheese. Our order was delivered quickly, and proved to be quite generous. The Ranch dressing on the side was a perfect complement to the fresh crunchy greens. We both ate our fill and there was plenty to take home for a second meal. I'm very happy this wonderful restaurant has opened in Novato!<//review>

The spicy chicken had heat, but wasn't as hot as I expected.  The sides are great. Okra was delicious. Mac n cheese was ooey gooey good. Great slaw with great flavor! Service was fast and food hot.< /Review>< pictures>

Eating my meal as I write the review. I rarely write any reviews but my meal has been awful. The salt levels on the fried tenders is burning my tongue and was painful to finish. The taste of the chicken is good but too much salt! The Mac side order is dry. I wish I could give this more stars but at this time 2 is fair.<//text>

The chicken sandwich was the best I’ve ever tasted. The crust on the chicken was not greasy at all and had the perfect seasonings and crunch. Meat was plentiful and moist. Coleslaw really nicely done with a tasty dressing. Pickles resembled bread and butter and very good. Service was friendly. Want to try other dishes next time if this is any indication of the quality. They use good organic chicken for starters which makes a huge difference. Please stay put in Novato!</review>

Oh my goodness! This food is delicious! I had the chicken sandwich (Popeyes move over) and Mac and cheese is nice and cheesy. The coleslaw is homemade and the pickles are great. If you’re in the area check them out.< /Text>

Placed an order over the phone and when we got there, they informed us they are out of some of the items we ordered. Should have been nice to know that while we ordered and before we drove down there. We wouldn’t of placed the order to begin with... waste of time.</review>

< Review>
Usually the chicken is really really good. This time, not so much. It was a little chewy. But normally it's tender and juicy. The cole slaw is sooooo good. As is the peach cobbler. I'm giving it 5 stars anyway as this was kind of miss whereas every other time it's been fantastic. Great service too.<//Review>

Great chicken and even better sides!

Edit: apparently their quality depends on whether or not the owner is present! It seems that if he’s not, the chicken isn’t good.<//review>

Great selection and tons of variety. Found pet stuff for my dogs and some tshirts for me. Not everything is a dollar but the deals are decent. They don’t sell beer or wine at this location. They have a huge health section and hostess donuts too!<//text>

Friendly employees, good location, good variety of items. Has all the basics that a convenience store should have, but at very reasonable prices. Also has some clothes & seasonal merchandise. Good deals on food, pet food, cleaning supplies, batteries, lots of stuff!</text>

<Text>Late review but I have time now to say...DONT COME HERE! If you do, be prepared to wait over an hour in line to go in, parking is $20 (understandable), but entry is $40 a person?!?! Cash only?! That’s $100 already if you bring someone plus drinks and all be prepared to get ripped off. Seats are trash. Dance floor is small. It’s really not worth it.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>Late review but... Whatever you do, DO NOT PULL CASH OUT OF THEIR ATM! ITS A SCAM! My girlfriend and I tried to pull $200 out, machine never gave us the money. Thought we’d try again and same thing! We lost $400 total! I asked the manager for a refund and instead we got kicked out! So unprofessional. I disputed 2xs with our bank and both times we got denied reimbursement because this place provided “proof” or “transaction receipts “ that showed we “got the money” both times! Please avoid this place. It’s a total scam.< /review>< Response>

Cool spot. I knew one of the go go dancers. They were super cute. DJ was amazing. He played a mix of hip hop and electronica. There was a guy playing the trumpet along with the music.  Seemed more like a concert than a club. Drinks are super expensive.< /Review>

<review>Honestly wish I can rate this no stars. 18+.
Self Parking $20. VIP Parking $20. Waited in line 40+ minutes. VIP entry $20. We had ask how much is entry fee we were told free bfor 11pm. We were already in line at 1030. We finally made it inside to pay one hour later and was told entry fee is $40 a person! And it’s cash only.

Uber/Lyft or have someone drop you off so you don’t pay a ridiculous parking fee. Plan to arrive early to beat the long line and the outrageous entry fee.</review><Gmap_id>0x80dd328b187321c1:0xe1f1183dea683cc6<//Gmap_id><name>Agnes Uti</name><UserId.>110675436684559554276<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

The band that played tonight made our night all bad we asked them since they started playing 11pm to play us a single song N I guess cause we didn't have $$$$ sign on our face they ignored us we asked a few times 3 different people but kept getting ignored. MONEY was no issue but yet am guessing to them it was. This was the 1st time N the only time there do to our experience. We will not be returning the band is not professional to please everyone equal no matter what...</review>

Great place to go but you must reserve ahead of time..If you like to listen to Spanish Mexican music this is the place to go. It gets heavy pack when famous singer comes but you can reserve ahead of time and get a good VIP table. You can reserve to number provided above😊< /review>

Had a blast Friday night with my closest friends. We enjoyed the environment at el malecon and are wanting to plan another weekend to go there and dance and relax ourselves. The only bad part is that closes at 2 am which it could be open a little longer.<//Text>

The dance floor keep getting smaller and smaller. They keep adding more tables and chairs to the point theres no room to dance! They just want you to consume more so you can keep the table if not they kick you out. The waiter will keep opening the beers from your bucket...so you can finish em up and buy more or kick you out the table for other people who are buying alcohol (bucket of beers or drinks)<//text>

<review>$30 to go in and no where to sit or dance. If you have $250 to Pay for a bottle, maybe you’ll have a chance to even dance.
It’s always so full no one Can even dance here.
If you come here make sure to have a table and get ready to bump into others.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I must say to make reservations sucks. They say send us a text and will call you as soon as we can but when they text you all they text you is junk, junk. We try to make reservation for a huge group of us and we were not able to do so. Says who that customer service is good when you never get to talk to someone or get a respond by email about your reservation. Maybe calling a year before would help. Good luck.< /Review>

I received this message yesterday, but when I went to the club with 6 of my friends ready to buy some bottles and party.   But when we arrived the lady who charges said text was not valid.  This is the 2nd time this happens to me at this club.  So after paying $20 for self parking I was rudely pushed out by the “host” said “we only want people who CAN pay”

I’m a business owner. Who Can pay.  assumptions is the mother of all ____ ups< /review><rating>1< /rating>< username>

<Text>I Come here all the time with my friends and always have a good time! I noticed some negative reviews for this place all I have to say is that its a great nightclub and some people need to understand things are going to obviously cost more just like when you go to a concert and drink $10 beers or $10 popcorn at the movies lol they have to pay the bands and artists and employees somehow right? I give them 5stars for thier great customer service!<//Text><userid>110650717184582831605< /userid>< user_name>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Worst night ever .
I always go to clubs and this was my first time going to el malecón .
Nunca en mi vida voy a volver !
Everything was super expensive and of course I payed but there was no space to dance or even walk
For the amount of money me and my partner and the rest of the 8 people I brought.
I do not appreciate how exepensive this was for the lack of space and the lack of customer service everyone was so rude !
The security’s felt they’re protecting el chapo .
Like this place looks elegant I’ll give it that . But it’s not what I expected at all.
(Nobody had a good time)
If you look around everyone is on there phone and just wondering why tf did they even go there
Such a waist of time and money .
I perfer to go back to my home town San Bernardino’s Pepe’s night club to have a good time and dance and the tickets are only 20.
I am not cheap at all I pay to have a good time .
I never have regrets .

<review>The only good thing about this place is the dj over crowded with tables for bottle service not allowed standing around this tiniest dance floor maybe about the size of 4 of their tables it's not a club it's a oversized restaurant with no food  and live music!!!! FYI  a club has a dance floor  and what this place has its not even close to anything like that!</review>< Pics>

This place pretty much sucks!! I tried making a reservation for 10 and they had a minimum of 4 bottle purchase at $230+ each...and we're heavy drinkers but we're not balling like that. They gave us price by phone and at the door it was more. There's no where to sit, no where to dance!! We tried getting a refund and they said NO! The reason for no dance floor was that it was a "concert". Oh yeah concert with no place to sit, just stand around anywhere you fit. NEVER GOING BACK!!!</text>

The place has way to many defects....  The defect it has are not really big things but when its a lot of litle things the amount to somrthing ... One of te things is every foo in there feels like they arw el chapo or something...  The place is way to over crouded  and no actual dance floor .. I dont think the small open space qualifies to be called a dance floor ..but the paace also has a clouple of things that kinda counter the bad ones..  Like theres lots of women . Another thing that need to be fixed is their answering machine beed to provide more infoo on rhe event going on that night in the club.... ♣< /Text>

By mistake I got that $$ back then at the paying both I ask the security guard which I was told to ask for a discount for all the inconvenience and then he tells me that I don't need to come in I turn around to walk to pay and he calls the door guards to escord me out and not to let me in.

The manager here at malecon is very unprofessional very inattentive very bad customer service the bathroom keepers are very rude and pushy they always hurry you to use the restroom I had been coming for a while till this bad experience where the manager was charging me for a bottle I apparently had paid that night but the bad part was that he was asking me for the money for the bottle till the next day when I had gave them my credit card to pay for that bottle that night twice not only did we wait in line for an hour to go in but I had ended the night bad with them very bad service they don’t care for your business only care about taking money and ripping people off don’t waste your time and money !<//Text>

< Review>
This location stays busy because it is on Ft Irwin and it is one of the few half way decent options to eat at.
The one complaint I have is that they only have one employee that works here. She is awesome and very efficient for what limited resources she has, but she is overwhelmed by the number of customers she has. I cant imagine how much revenue this location loses because people dont have time to wait because of time constraints.<//Review>

Can't actually make any of the sandwiches on their new menu. If you want Swiss spinach mushroom for example, first time I went in, no spinach or mushroom, second time, no Swiss. Really simple stuff they struggle with. Wish there was another good breakfast spot on post but welcome to Fort Irwin.</text>

<Review>If i could give this place zero stars i would. They gave away our order to the people in front of us and instead of apologizing and trying to rectify it they said they ran out of what we ordered and could only give us what they had left.

<text>No very good!
Went in this morning to get the "Bakers Dozen". There was not a good selection of beagles. There were very few to choose from. Not a happy camper!!! :-(

Great bagel sandwiches,  but they really work at a slow pace. Prices are ok and staff was friendly. Not a great selection of bagels, though, they seem to be out of most bagels most of the time.</Text>

Workers were not very professional and we're borderline rude. They were almost out of everything and were not making anymore. Sold me coffee but didn't have any made for 20 minutes. Just a very sad and pitiful experience.<//Review>

Their golden ale is delicious and only $2 during happy hour which starts at 3pm. The sliders hh special were only $5 and come with tots or fries and were so delicious. Make your own custom burger if you fancy love this spot.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c3282bd02cb517:0xfe8dd417237fd42b<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>I met my BFF's there to celebrate my birthday. The burger I ate was so delicious! The onion rings and pot stickers were fire!! The service was on point. Everyone was so friendly. Even though they were wearing masks, you can see they were smiling with their eyes. An all around great experience.</Review>< Pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Dining choices around here can be limited to mostly Asian, Mexican and burgers. Inspired by a good review in the local paper, we gave this place a try and found it to be a cut above the rest. Burger places are usually boring for non-meat eaters, but the veggie burger here is worth the trip. It is made in-house with fresh ingredients and not just thawed out from a package like you find in most places. The custom toppings and tasty brioche buns allow you to enjoy your burger and eat vegetarian at the same time. Definitely worth a trip.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

The Gourmet burgers lived up to the expectations. For the sides, I prefer the fries over the tots, but the Buffalo chicken tots were excellent. Unless you have a very big appetite go half order which is more than enough for two to share. The prices are reasonable for what you get!<//review>

**THIS PLACE IS STILL OPEN DURING COVID** I absolutely love their burgers. I've been wanting to try this place before the pandemic hit, but I never got to, but during the quarantine I have tried it many times and it has been delicious every time. Although a burger being delivered 30 minutes later can never be as good as a fresh one, this one still tasted good and I can't even imagine how good it tastes at the restaurant. The best part is that you can create your own burger if you just can't decide what you want in your burger Becusse you love everything.
Oh also, their poutine is really good! A super good amount of food too.
I can't wait to try this place in<//Text>

<text>Always a chill atmosphere. We chose to come here instead of the neighbor bars in this same center. Glad we got a table inside. The guy handing the orders was real chill, vibrant and friendly. I feel like I know him from somewhere. Good times. Thanks for the hospitality.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Bun Street is honestly a really good burger place. The burgers here are top-notch quality and are some of the best ones I've had. I've only had a plain cheeseburger with ketchup from here so I can't give too much of an opinion, but just that one burger was enough to love this place.

I would recommend that people should come here.<//Review><Response>None<//Response>< userid>

Great food person at cashier not welcoming. 1st time there would love if you didn't have to pay up front. Would only go to take food home not sit and eat my food there.  To each his own make your own judgment. 4 stars for food 1 for hospitality.< /text>

Great place for a burger. I had the Western and my husband had the California. It was big and messy - just the way I like them. Got a side of mac for my daughter and she loved it (so did I when I stole a bite). Their berry lemonade was great as was their house beer.< /review>

The burgers don't come with fries so I ordered the Seasoned fries which, curiously aren't seasoned. At All. Just plain fries. Maybe a hint of salt but not what you'd expect. They are good as plain old fries tho. We also ordered a Chicken Salad but I didn't get any as she wouldn't share so I can't comment. LOL. Chocolate chip cookie served warm with Vanilla Icecream on top with chocolate drizzle was delicious.</Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< Name>

I ordered the southwest chicken sandwich and it was pretty damn good. Thick and juicy crispy chicken patty, Swiss cheese, smoked Applewood bacon, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles all on a delicious brioche buns. Big sandwich enjoyed every single bite.</text>

<Review>Bun Street was really great! Delicious and the positions seemed great and best of all, we were able to share and try a bit of everything. I had the teriyaki burger but I changed the angus beef to salmon... Not a good idea. Stick to the beef. The tots were delicious as well as the mac n cheese! Delicious! We were not aware of this spot and we'll definitely be coming back soon.< /Review>< pictures>

Food was amazing and tasted so fresh. Got the western burger, which was absolutely amazing, if you want a good burger, go here. Also got the carne asada fries, which were amazing as well. The sitting area outside is nice and relaxing, and loved the food. Will definitely come back, especially if you're in the mood for some amazing burgers.< /text>

I was really looking forward to the steak fries but was very disappointed.. Looked nothing like the picture on the menu with strips of steak.... Its like the meet was chewed for me. No flavor. And the tater tots were cold and no flavoand soggy. I expected crispy tots.  I know it was late but you give it your best no matter what time it is. Not going back.< /Text>

This place is really great. Amazing food, great beer and good environment. 5/5. I got the parmesan garlic fries and Southwest chicken both of them amazing, specially the sandwich. I also recommend the hazy pup beer: light with a great taste. I recommend this place and definitely coming back.<//Review>

Delicious burgers! Ask for the number garlic cheese, it will change the way you view a burger. It has the consistency of ricotta and a flavor that is out of this world!< /Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><resp>None</resp><review>It was pretty tasty. We will be back!
I liked that I could go out to a local restaurant to have a "burger" without having to eat meat!
The fries were great & plenty! I had the veggie burger with grilled onion, pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles on a Hawaiian bun & my babe had the stickin burger with garlic cheese on a brioche bun. With sweet potato & regular fries.
Also they have tons of local brewed beers!<//review></record>

<Text>Bun Street has Gourmet hamburgers, crispy chicken and grilled chicken. I ordered the Southwest Chicken and substituted the crispy chicken with grilled chicken it was pretty good. The waiter was very friendly and very accommodating. They are dog friendly with outside seating. The waiter even brought my daughter's dog a fresh bowl of water. I would like to go back.< /Text>< rate>

Quaint little spot that really impressed me. Appetizers are fire (poutiiiine, bro!) and the burgers are as gigantic as they are delicious. Stellar beer selection too with lots of local stuff. Friendly service and a cute patio out front. After only one visit, it has filled the hole in my heart from when the Burger House closed❤< /Review>

I gave a bad review the first time I tried this place but this business reached out to me and personally contacted me to help make up for the food that was served to my brother and I. I appreciate every action taken to help make the bun street experience a good one. Irving demonstrated such professionalism and was courteous the whole time. Everyone that works here also attended us well and made everything a pleasurable experience. I would definitely come back again and recommend coming to this place.< /Text>

We just happened to find this place. Everything was very delicious. We didn't get a chance to order the burgers because we were already kind of full from the day. But everything we ordered was absolutely delicious and I cannot wait to go back to try the burgers with that big thick applewood-smoked bacon.<//text>

One of my favorite spots to grab a burger and a beer to watch a game! You gotta try the “Californian”; comes with smoked wood bacon, avocado and fried egg! Side of parmesan fries.</Text>

Super yummy. Went there for date night, party of 2, and was told the wait would be 20 minutes. We waited maybe 10 minutes and were offered a bartop seat which we happily accepted. The food was great although they forgot about our fries.. we weren't too upset as we also ordered the tots which held us over. Yum.  We'll be returning. And they have a great happy hour according to their menu.<//Review>

Pretty cool spot that I found through Google, the place was a lil loud due to a baseball game they had on tv, might not be the place if you're looking for some peace and quiet , I had myself the western burger which was pretty good, I recommend it if you like onion rings smothered in bbq sauce, the waiter was a nice guy making sure we had plenty to drink, the tator tots were very delicious and I highly recommend it, definitely going back to try this place again. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because I didn't see a dessert menu, I might of missed it. But this place is definitely worth checking out.</Review>

<Text>Bun Street has Gourmet hamburgers, crispy chicken and grilled chicken. I ordered the Southwest Chicken and substituted the crispy chicken with grilled chicken it was pretty good. The waiter was very friendly and very accommodating. They are dog friendly with outside seating. The waiter even brought my daughter's dog a fresh bowl of water. I would like to go back.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGXV47Ned27u2cGiEVWq4G0ajoDqnt7v2iAdOs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

The wings were on the tiny side, salty, and kinda dry. The asada fries were saltier than the dead sea. I am trying to spare those from developing a parched tongue. If any employees see this please, take it easy on the salt. There is no need for me to chug my drink after one fry. The berry lemonade is yummy.<//text>

Hidden gem!

West Co, how long have you been hiding Bun Street from me??!

My little cousin brought me here for dinner and it was the best day of my life. They have a great selection of craft beers on draft, blessings. The menu is full of tasty offerings that it makes it hard to order just one dish. We ended up with specialty fries, tots and the macaroni and cheese. I cannot express how delicious this meal was, you need to try it for yourself

Highly recommend. This is 1000x better than Chili’s.< /text>

<time>1550613514285< /time><rate>5< /rate><Text>Surprised I haven't heard of Bun Street until now! I'm glad I decided to take the family to check it out! The location is easy to find with parking spots all around, the inside has a warm environment and customer service is 100% spot on! We tried their Western Bacon Burger and their Lechon Fries.... very delicious. The western bacon is worth the $11, it's big with flavor and the bacon and hickory bbq sauce stood out in every bite! I really like their Lechon fries, its smothered with their signature green sauce and the pulled pork/lechon has tons of flavor! I'll definitely be going back SOON<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7r7DRXG4fvWGrFTmR8aOjW6KIcWl7j6eaPNff=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNy3Cx-vSocOK4BDDzMIREUugX7d6pqYUqGeo49=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgb4LFxKqHcZG8EUDDElffJWq1PWiYh4rKk0Kx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

<text>Was here once before a few years back before I would do reviews...but they get 5 stars then and now! Just got home with a full and very happy belly. In fact had to have a few more bites of the poutine tots before they went in the fridge!!
I loved the garlic burger. They have a good selection of specialty burgers that all sound yummy. Or you can build your own if those don't float your boat.
Great quality...you can definitely tell it's not a frozen patty. And the brioche bun is magnifique👌  Interesting and different sides to indulge your appetite with large enough portions to share or take home for later.
Friendly customer service and lots of seating available since they blocked off part of the parking lot.<//text>< Pics>

My wife and I happened to be in the area and decided to try this place that I had never heard of. We were impressed. This is a small place with great burgers and some good beer(s) on tap. I had the stinkin bun and she had a western burger. The stinkin bun has garlic cheese, grilled onions and garlic aioli among other things. I loved it. My wife enjoyed her burger as well. We also shared some parmesan garlic fries that are fantastic. I drank a house ale made by Golden Road. It was light but has a great after taste. Definitely coming back.<//Text>

<Text>My wife and I happened to be in the area and decided to try this place that I had never heard of. We were impressed. This is a small place with great burgers and some good beer(s) on tap. I had the stinkin bun and she had a western burger. The stinkin bun has garlic cheese, grilled onions and garlic aioli among other things. I loved it. My wife enjoyed her burger as well. We also shared some parmesan garlic fries that are fantastic. I drank a house ale made by Golden Road. It was light but has a great after taste. Definitely coming back.<//Text><GmapID>0x80c3282bd02cb517:0xfe8dd417237fd42b</GmapID><user_name>David Bouzanquet</user_name>< Resp>

Came here for lunch with my friend.  He got the western burger with tots... while I wasn't that hungry so I ordered of the happy hour menu... sliders with fries. Note happy hour is every day from 3pm-6pm. We also shared an order of the bun street tots.

The burger looked impressive and appetizing.   There was a lot going.... bacon, bbq sauce, onion rings, melty cheese, lettuce, pickle and tomato. The meat was good, the onion rings where nice and crispy. The bbq sauce was a bit on the sweet side.  I think it would have been better with a bbq that had more of a smoky flavor.  Also I don't typically see western burgers with the veggies.

The bun street tots consisted of grilled onions with boys of bacon and there version of 1,000 island sauce. I thought the fries were just ok.  The sauce was fine but missing something. And the grilled onions with bacon were just slightly on the salty side.

The sliders were simple meat bread burgers.... nothing to write hone about.  But I will say they did have the brioche bun just right.  Moist and fluffy! Very yummy.

The service was average.... friendly.</text>

Pretty cool spot that I found through Google, the place was a lil loud due to a baseball game they had on tv, might not be the place if you're looking for some peace and quiet , I had myself the western burger which was pretty good, I recommend it if you like onion rings smothered in bbq sauce, the waiter was a nice guy making sure we had plenty to drink, the tator tots were very delicious and I highly recommend it, definitely going back to try this place again. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because I didn't see a dessert menu, I might of missed it. But this place is definitely worth checking out.<//Text>

<Text>Favorite Burger Joint in West Co.
Outstanding burger quality, delicious sides, and fantastic beer selection.

This review is LONG over due. I've been coming to this place for years. The burger quality will have you craving for more once you've had it.

The prepared burgers are delicious, and they offer a build your own, if you're undecided. Good selection of sides. The tots are delicious.

The beer selection is great too. Pairs well with the tastiness of their food.

Atmosphere is modern, and clean. The staff is always amazing. Best of all, they are dog friendly. I've brought my little fur buddy to seat with me at their patio section. The staff always offers waters and bowls. That really means a lot.

As I've said, this is my favorite burger joint in town. High praise for this place.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

They offer a variety of choices it can either be regarding your burger of the way you want your fries or tater tots. The service is great. They also have a bar if you so choose to have a alcoholic beverage. This truly is a place you want to take the family or hang out with your friends to have a drink and watch a game.<//text>< Rating>

<time>1558358611560</time><Text>Portions are generous, Tasted the Mac and cheese side and Mac and cheese burger, both are delicious.

Split the poutine with fries vs tots it was great too. Nicely balanced flavors. I tried the buffalo chicken and truffle. Can recommend truffle a smidge more, but I'm a buffalo flavor fan.

Staff was friendly and warm. They didn't give me any passive aggressive snark or anything for trying to fit an 11 top at 9:30pm on a Saturday. It was great. Worked out well.

I'm not a fan of IPA beer, but they have a good selection. I was told the star dust (perhaps Tsar dust?) Was good.

If Google maps is taking you here, it's easier to turn into the parking lot first, vs the actual street then turn into the parking lot. Plenty of parking.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPC7dcox7lloKi57jFojSfuBSS8QLJIbzRoMkMV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><UserId.>117215539757232083672</UserId.>< Resp>

<review>Great little place! Stopped by for the first time today as it was on the way back home and I am glad I did! I had the Hawaiian Burger. It was a little too sweet so I had to add some hot sauce and it was perfect (for me atleast). Great people working the counter as well! Thank you for a pleasant experience and can't wait to go back! 👌🏼<//review>< Name>

Amazing burgers, fries and drinks! Food here was amazing and provided a great ambient to eat. Food takes some time to get to your table, but it's worth the wait. Food is simply amazing, with great drink service too. They also offer sides such as poutine fries and pizza fries which are as good as the food. Drinks were also great. While the food is a great hidden gem, located behind the theatre, be wary, as the prices are rather high, so be prepared for that.</text>

The staff always offers waters and bowls. That really means a lot.As I've said, this is my favorite burger joint in town, and probably my one if my all time favorites to be honest. High praise for this place.<//review>

One of the best restaurant I've ever been! The staff is incredible friendly, the seating is awesome and the food is so delicious. I had the tuna sashimi, the brokkolini with peanuts and the incredible pineapple parfait!! I highly recommend this dessert. The best ever!!</Text>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>Was okay. Took forever to be seated. I guess staff let parties take up tables when they aren't actually dining, so it took forever and a day for them to have a table ready for my party. It wasn't even that busy that night, tbh. Lets talk about how the burgers don't come with fries? Like what's up with that? A burger place that doesn't serve fries with their burgers is a total cop-out. Denny's does better.<//review>< Pictures>

Very nice place. Tucked away but clean and welcoming. Service is excellent, I was helped immediately after I walked in. Took my order to go dive i didn't have time to stay. My food was made quickly and cooked well. The burger was one of the top 2 I've ever had and the fries were perfectly cooked. Best place around for burgers!<//review>

West Co, how long have you been hiding Bun Street from me??!

My little cousin brought me here for dinner and it was the best day of my life. They have a great selection of craft beers on draft, blessings. The menu is full of tasty offerings that it makes it hard to order just one dish. We ended up with specialty fries, tots and the macaroni and cheese. I cannot express how delicious this meal was, you need to try it for yourself

Highly recommend. This is 1000x better than Chili’s.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpwyj-tHDeKebIGKFgrGDGelC9V5lQoa-X5NJM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

I tried this place yesterday based on reviews on Google. There were a couple of small issues: The server couldn't answer in anything other than a commercial. "What is in the bun sauce?" "It's a house version based on Thousand Island dressing. It's very good!" A little irritating as I only wanted an answer not an advert. Additionally the meat was cooked a little differently than I expected. This is understandable as there is no universal measure for rare, medium or well. There is always a little variation and I would recommend that you ask for your burger to be cooked a little more than you normally have it as they tend to undercook a little - my medium was closer to what I would consider medium rare as was my daughter-in-law's, my wife's well was closer to what she considered medium-well.
Other than those small issues, this place is amazing! The house sauce is very good, the burgers were very tasty and generous in size, the onion rings were decent and the fries were so good, I would go back just for those alone. All in all a very good experience.<//text>

First time here and it was so good!  We ordered Buffalo tater tots to eat before our meal and they came out fast.  Our food was actually super fast to our table and we had just started on our appetizer when it came out, no complaints here though. Burgers we're big and cooked just right. Our server Spencer was also awesome and very attentive. Can't wait to go back. Definitely one of my new favorite spots.< /text>

This was our second trip to Bun Street and it was just as enjoyable as the first. Our waitress was very accommodating offering tastes of beer on draft as my wife could not decide. Ultimately she chose the house blonde. The chef must be very keen on timing as my grilled chicken on my salad was perfectly cooked. I order grilled chicken salads frequently and find most restaurants overcook the chicken. So when it is done right, it is a surprise. There seems to be no end of the ways fries can be enhanced at Bun Street. We have enjoyed plain and Garlic so far and I am looking to try something more adventurous next time.<//Text>

I have been a doordash customer since 2017 and I am saddened to see this restaurant is the only restaurant I’ve received food that is not sealed . The tater tots were spilled  on the floor of the bag because they were not in a container. There was an attempt to seal the bag with 3 staples. However it was not completely sealed and really do not think that it helped from protecting particles from getting in. I feel like this is the least they can do in a pandemic. Even prior to the pandemic many restaurants sealed their food prior to giving it to the doordasher for hygienic and safety reasons. My fiancée was happy with the buffalo chicken tater tots but the salad was literally all yellow dead lettuce and extremely overpriced. Also the food portion compared to the price In my opinion is not worth it.</text>

This place is cool the burger are different to fast-food burgers. You can choose from many of there different options. Onion rings were pretty good and the Hawaiian burger was really good too made with Hawaiian bread. Really recommend this place if you are craving a good burger and in a different style.</Text>

Met the owner today, what a wonderful human being. I always love the food here! Been here about 3 or 4 times in the past 2 years of living in baldwin park, always delicious. (Personally I have a sensitivity to salt so it could be personal preference but ill get the fries no salt)
I'll be back, definitely if Eli is working because he has fantastic customer service skills and is interesting to talk to.

Yummy delicious food always, enjoy!

<review>I went here because I saw peanut butter and jelly burgers on their menu and I was intrigued by it.

Gotta say, it exceeded my expectations. I ordered that and my friend ordered the El Diablo burger, which he thoroughly enjoyed (although he did say the PBJ burger was better). I also ordered the berry lemonade, which was delicious.

The service was great. If you want a burger in the area that's a little different, I'd recommend Bun Street!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Amazing burgers, fries and drinks! Food here was amazing and provided a great ambient to eat. Food takes some time to get to your table, but it's worth the wait. Food is simply amazing, with great drink service too. They also offer sides such as poutine fries and pizza fries which are as good as the food. Drinks were also great. While the food is a great hidden gem, located behind the theatre, be wary, as the prices are rather high, so be prepared for that.< /Review>

<Review>This place is AMAZING. If you’ve been wanting to try a ramen burger this place is great. I’ve ordered here so many times while in quarantine and they’ve never let me down. Whenever I order grubhub from them they take that extra step and cut my box a lil so the food doesn’t get soggy when it gets to me. Genius lol. Overall just a really great place, never had a bad meal here</Review>< Gmap_id>

Add garlic aioli / pickled onions
It was amazeballs!!!
My boyfriend did a create your own with
Ramen bun/ angus beef / bacon / tomato / teriyaki glaze
It was also super tasty!

Dont forget to try the house made onion rings with the trio of sauces!!!!< /Review>

< Review>
I was at this establishment for maybe 30. Service was quick, well done, no issues or complaints. Menu was (I felt) too much to go over and read through, so I simply built my on burger. Atmosphere was actually very well good and calm. Nothing serious really, everyone just having a jolly good time. The problem is with food. I has four dishes, two of which were as plain as water (Mac and cheese) and the burgers were basically on par with something like BurgerKing - the only difference was Bun Streets burger was more pleasing to the eye.</Review>

<Text>I had never had Peruvian food and decided to give this place a try after having passed it many times. Checked it out on TA, found very favorable reviews, and off I went on a Thursday evening. It was close to 7:00pm on a weekenight, but 3/4 filled with people enjoying themselves. It is not fancy inside, nor is it plain. The ambience is casual and very friendly. The menu has plenty of choices and many of the dishes come in your choice of fish, chicken or beef. I had a shredded chicken in a delicious sauce over wonderful potatoes...and big mound of very flavorful rice on the side. Yup, potatoes and rice. As many other TA reviewers have noted, it works! The portion was fine; some of the other dishes had very large portions. Bottom line, do not be afraid to try this cuisine if it is new to you. The dishes are like good comfort food, nothing that should in any way scare off a timid palate. You will like it. Everyone I talk to who has gone, does. And the prices are terrific.< /Text><UserId.>107065486287042954197<//UserId.><Date>1561186746773</Date><rate>5</rate>< response>

I've eaten here at least 5 times (so far). I'm hoping to try as many items as my body will allow me. So far there is nothing that hasn't been excellent! I especially love the pizza tots. Burgers and fries are great too!< /review>

<Review>Went here for lunch and ordered the pastrami burger lunch special with garlic parmesan tots... took a bite and was like...  damn it's good. Wish I took a pic but I could wait to bite into the burger... and before you know it,  it was gone! Definitely will return,  I want to try other burgers on their menu.. looked delicious. Next time I'll have a beer with it, it's only right.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>I've been coming here for a few years.  I usually have the salmon burger which is very good.  It's moist and well-seasoned.  You have many choices of what sauces, veggies, etc to put on your burger.   The crisp onion rings have special sauces that come with them.  The service is very friendly and efficient.
I love to sit outside when the whether permits.  Inside, there are 7 T.V.s going, which isn't my first choice, but some like that.< /Review>< userid>

Love their happy hour price!! $2 budlight... can't beat that~The Parking: Plaza parking lot (free)< /Review>< UserId.>

I've been coming here for a few years.  I usually have the salmon burger which is very good.  It's moist and well-seasoned.  You have many choices of what sauces, veggies, etc to put on your burger.   The crisp onion rings have special sauces that come with them.  The service is very friendly and efficient.
I love to sit outside when the whether permits.  Inside, there are 7 T.V.s going, which isn't my first choice, but some like that.< /review>

Went here for lunch and ordered the pastrami burger lunch special with garlic parmesan tots... took a bite and was like...  damn it's good. Wish I took a pic but I could wait to bite into the burger... and before you know it,  it was gone! Definitely will return,  I want to try other burgers on their menu.. looked delicious. Next time I'll have a beer with it, it's only right.</review>

Their stinkin bun burger is amazing! I added grilled pineapple to mine and it was a lovely addition. Their french fries are well seasoned with salt and are a nice balance between soft and crisp. They offer a refillable berry lemonade that is refreshing. I would definitely come back.<//review>

We were just down the street and hungry. Google Maps listed this place and it was new to us so we stopped. Glad we did. We got the Homemade onion rings and Mozzarella sticks for appetizers. Rings were light and crispy with a slight Teriyaki zip to them. Excellent. The Mozzarella sticks were just OK. I thought the California burger was very good. The Stinkin' Bun Burger was voted good too. The burgers don't come with fries so I ordered the Seasoned fries which, curiously aren't seasoned. At All. Just plain fries. Maybe a hint of salt but not what you'd expect. They are good as plain old fries tho. We also ordered a Chicken Salad but I didn't get any as she wouldn't share so I can't comment. LOL. Chocolate chip cookie served warm with Vanilla Icecream on top with chocolate drizzle was delicious.< /Text>

For our entrees,  we ordered the California Burger (burger with bacon, egg and avocado); Mac n Cheese Burger (burger with Mac/Cheese and BBQ sauce) with a side of onion rings and tots. Everything was as wonderful as you'd imagine.

My girlfriend and I like it so much that we try to eat there once a week. Try to make a reservation because this restaurant is always packed. It's always packed because the food is really good and the restaurant employees are very approachable and friendly towards the customers. It's a welcoming place. That's what I like about this family-owned business. They take a lot of pride in making delicious and creative items for their menu.

Another pro: You can watch your favorite sports games on TV while you eat.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

< Review>
The first time we found this place was when my wife and I were at Ikea and were looking for a local place to eat. We tried this place and loved it. They make delicious burger creations and tasty parmesan garlic fries.

We like this place so much that we constantly ask each other if we need anything from Ikea just so we can stop at Bun Street. We've had just about all of their signature burgers and they are all very good that I can't decide which is my favorite. Maybe it's  the California Burger.

The service is great, the food comes out quickly, and the waiters are very attentive.</Review>

AMAZING! You must give this place a try! It's in a perfect location to do dinner and then a movie.  The California Burger was incredibly tasty!  The personal service was so great.  We felt very welcome.  The menu made it hard to order because we wanted everything!  Great addition to our date-night choices.  Thank you Bun Street.< /Text>

Hidden gem - we were in town for 24 hours. Landed, were hungry, and found this place on our way.

We just had apps, but they were delicious!!!!!

Potstickers - great flavor! and just enough to hit the spot!
Loaded Tots - OMG, if nothing else, you have to get these!!!!!! I took leftovers and had them the next morning (yes that good)!

Great beer on tap as well. I had a mimosa, but wasn't a fan of the champagne they used.<//Text>

<Review>A buddy of mine showed me this spot and wow.  Their burgers are so good, they will make them just like you want even in a lettuce wrap.  They have so many beers on tap, great for college kids or if you want to watch a game, perfect place to chill out at.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

This place has gourmet burgers at a reasonable price. Could build your own with a selection of in house burgers(few). But rather very tasty and in a little hole in the wall.< /Review>

The best burgers in town. About $15.00 per person. They make the best garlic parmesan fries. They also have the best onion rings. A must try place if you are a burger person.<//text>

The Service: Many staffs on duty. Service is efficient.

The Food: If you are ordering burger.... definitely want to add an fried egg!! Not only it looks good in the picture, but it absolutely add more flavor to the burger!!

I also love their onion rings!! Super crispy~ and whatever sauce they drizzle on top, yummmmm!!!

Love their happy hour price!! $2 budlight... can't beat that~

The Parking: Plaza parking lot (free)<//Review>

< review>
Decent burgers joint, nice suggested combinations and good 🍟 fries. They have a a variety of bun options but a "gluten free bun*" was  not an option unfortunately. But they gladly lettuce rapped my California Burger. Which along with the service was very nice... But yes my burger patty was tasteful and YES they mounted on the toppings, and YES my lettuce rapped burger immediately fall apart upon the first bite..

To sum up the place, this restaurant is a inspiring burger joint with the price tag to match. They have interesting customization options to choose from throughout their menu. For example, a ramen bun option made from, you guessed it, ramen noodles. So yeah, do with that what you will.. They also make their own custom cheese, IN HOUSE. The Bun Street Garlic Cheese, I had this on my burger and to keep it mild, I'll just say I wish I went with American cheese instead...

*Yes lettuce rapped is a gluten free option, but everyone knows it sucks... 😒🍔

The end.< /review>

< Review>
This place has got some major burgers and onion rings! I got the stinkin burger or something, which was basically garlic aloli and cheese on a burger. It was quite delicious and very filling, as well as the onion rings. My only wish was if there were more onions rings, but it was beautiful presentation. You just have to find the right time to go because I do believe it gets busy at certain times of the night.< /Review>

This place has got some major burgers and onion rings! I got the stinkin burger or something, which was basically garlic aloli and cheese on a burger. It was quite delicious and very filling, as well as the onion rings. My only wish was if there were more onions rings, but it was beautiful presentation. You just have to find the right time to go because I do believe it gets busy at certain times of the night.< /text>

Bun street is a great mom and pop burger joint with great micro brews. They had an awesome Horchata Stout that really smelled just like an horchata. Definitely try that if they still have it. Also, their PB&J burger is surprisingly good. You wouldn’t think they go together but it has quickly become a favorite.<//Text>

<Text>Awesome food, awesome atmosphere, & awesome staff! The food was super delicious. We were lucky to come on Monday which is all day Happy Hour. We got mozzarella sticks, onion rings, poutine, sweet potato fries, California Burger & Mac n' Cheese Burger; to top it off we got the Bunnuts with ice cream. Everything was delicious & of course enough for leftovers.
The interior was very industrial with the metal walls but it was actually very cozy. It was a rainy day but it felt just right indoors. The staff was super cool. Jill was our server this day. She was very attentive & super knowledgeable to all of our questions.
I will definitely go back & try all the other stuff I didn't get to order!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Came here for lunch with a friend.  It was good.  Got a half order of fries with my burger because it was happy hour. I like it because they serve the impossible burger.  The burger itself was a little over cooked (it's not real meat guys lol) but was seasoned well. Subbing the impossible patty into their premade burgers was tricky because the impossible is their most expensive "meat" option but all their premade burger options come with meat, like bacon or pastrami or pulled pork. Obviously if your ordering the impossible you don't want that stuff so why charge so much for less? It's a new menu option though so they might work out the kinks soon.</Review>

<review>Bun Street is a burger place. They serve specialty burgers, salads, sides, craft fries, tots, soft drinks, wine, and beer. You also have an option of building your own burger.

We were greeted upon entry and asked if we wanted to sit outside or inside. We requested for indoor seating. They sat us on the third table from the far right. It was nice that they gave us space from the other tables. Another server came by and asked if we wanted anything to drink. Within a few minutes, she took our orders.

I ordered the Mac N' Cheese Burger. It was fantastic! Huge portion of the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese portion was superb. Rich cheese flavor and the macaroni texture was soft with a slight firmness to it. The angus beef patty was thick and juicy. The BBQ sauce was sweet and not overly heavy. The lettuce was fresh. The buns were soft and held the burger together nicely. At no point did the buns become soggy. I didn't think mac and cheese would work on a burger but surprisingly it did. This had to be one of the best burgers I've had. Since we arrived before 3pm on a weekday, the burger came with a side of fries. The fries were perfect. They were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.

The Pizza Fries were pretty good. The fries portion was huge. The pepperoni was slightly spicy, the marinara was zesty, and the mozzarella was milky. I ended up eating the rest of the fries when we got home. It was much better then because by that point the marinara was fully absorbed into the fries making it very rich and packed with flavor.

The service was great. The food arrived within 15 minutes. Our server was very friendly and incredibly attentive. When we folded up the straw paper and left it on the table, she came by randomly and picked it up. After we had a few bites of our food, she came by and asked how everything was. When she saw that I was fumbling for napkins, she asked if I wanted more napkins. After we put everything in boxes, she asked if she could take the plates out of he way. It wasn't like she was standing next to us the whole time. It just seemed like the timing was perfect when she came out to ask things.

Indoor seating consists of a long wooden booth with tables and metal chairs on the opposite side. These tables were in close proximity with each other. There is also bar seating. There are lots of TVs on the walls and they were all on mute.

The Mac N' Cheese Burger was fantastic and the Pizza Fries were pretty good. I did get massive heartburn afterwords but it was worth it. I'll be back for another visit.< /review><user_id>114085413776062826851</user_id>< gmapID>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>UPDATE

So pretty shortly after posting my first review, I received a msg from the business owner apologizing for my terrible experience. Then he asked if I was willing to give them another chance and offered a gift card. I do love their onion rings so I said I would, if there will be an improvement and thanked him for reaching out and trying to mend the situation.

That was 3 days ago.

Maybe he thought just throwing out an empty offer would make me change my review. I wish he hadn't even messaged me now since it's clear their customer service is far below the standard. Even follow up is a mess.

Again, what a joke.

ORIGINAL REVIEW

Sat down, waited at least 15 min while the servers were busy taking orders, serving food and checking up on guests right next to us (on both sides cause we were in the center). They must have passed by us at least 17 times. No one even bothered to ask for a drink while one of the servers (a guy in glasses and a hat) was busy chatting with the big table next to us that were clearly his friends. They just kept on looking but couldn't bother to even take our drink order. If they had, it would have bought them at least 10 more min. So we got up and walked out. Still, no one bothered to say anything or attempt to apologize. (It wasn’t even fully occupied, mind you) What a joke.

So disgusted with how we were treated. It's a shame because the first visit was so exceptional.

Never again.< /text>< date>

Small burger joint with indoor and outdoor seating located behind the Edwards movie theater. Alcohol is served here along with tator tots. Highly reccomend tator tots and burgers. Inside is a bit tight if you're trying to get bench seating but there's also bar seating as well.</Review>

<text>Bun street is a decent place to go grab a bite at, i recomend going during their happy hour (4-6) to get the most bang for your buck. Its actually very small so it can feel a somewhat crowded in there, the workers there are really nice, very polite and quite attentative. The prizes are what youd expect for a restaurant so be prepare to spend some dough for a decently sized meal<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Text>I ordered their "Stinkin Bun Burger" which came with 100% angus beef, garlic cheese, grilled onions, lettuce, onion rings, and garlic aioli.  It was delicious.  The garlic cheese was a very unique flavor and complemented the burger quite well.   I also ordered their poutine (cheese and gravy Canadian style) tater tots.  You have the option to use fries or tots.  That in itself was a full meal.  It was also very delicious.  With great food and great service, I approve of this burger place!  Go try it now!< /Text>< Pictures>
