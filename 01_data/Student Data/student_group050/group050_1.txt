However when I was passing through the area and stopped in to order to go I noticed there was no adherence to current state covid related rules or procedures which made me feel very uncomfortable ordering. I ordered the wet burrito (which was delicious) and my partner ordered the crispy tacos and a super burrito both of which he said were very dry. An hour or so later me and my partner were both vomiting and nauseous for the rest of the evening.  Perhaps the lack of following health guidelines in the dining room correlates to the kitchen as well...
Despite fond childhood memories I don't think I can stomach to eat here again.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

The food is delicious, obviously house made and comes with chips and salsa all for a fair price! The salsa bar is missing at this time (covid strikes again), but they are accommodating to all our needs so that is appreciated!  The outdoor eating space is wonderfully shaded so we were comfortable to eat there for dinner even in the 100 degree heat.  You should all try this place, it's a gem!</review>< UserId.>

I dont have the 5+ years background experience everyone else seems to have but on my 2 experiences its been hit and miss. The first time was worthy of 5 stars and the second visit was worthy of 1 star so averaged it out to 3. It seems that this establishment is on a budget cutting whatever corners they can cut. The food was dry and inedible in some meals and just right in others. So roll the dice and hope for the best when coming here.</text>

The people who work here have been there since I first ate here 6 or so years ago. Amazing food, great service, super friendly people, and the atmosphere is very nice. They have the BEST refried beans too. They just updated the menu to digital screens so you can see the food, which is awesome because I'm horrible with Spanish. Very clean, one of the only places my wife will actually use the bathroom at. If you haven't been, or are on the fence, you will not regret going. The whole family goes here at least twice a week when we come visit. A must for people who really love Mexican food.</text>< rate>

< Review>
Met up with a cousin for breakfast. It was nice and quite so we felt we'd have no problem get hot fresh food. The friendly counter attendant took our order from their menu and confirmed the toppings that came on our order. (5 stars for friendly service), our meal finally arrived well over 20 to 25 minutes later. There were only 3 other people having breakfast and no one else. We ordered the most simplest Mexican dish ever made Chilaqiles plate with rice and beans. Most but not all Mexican restaurant opt to use canned refried beans which was evident in the taste. Rice was average like everyone else's. However the biggest let down was the main course of Chilaqiles which had minimal amount of cheese... Which many other places offer  authentic Queso Fresco which is crumbled over the meal. It taste way better and the tortilla chips were completely bland and soggy. 90% of Mexican restaurants prepare this dish in a way that the chips have a crispness to the chips the sause is not over drenched. The additional topping of chopped onion is added to give flavor to the meal. (Optional by the way if you like onion.) I personally have made Chilaqiles at home countless times for family and friends. Even going so far as to use pre-fried chips from the Mexican supermarkets to expidite not having to fry a large amount chips on the fly. But to have to wait over 20 min for microwaved food is unacceptable. I didnt read the reviews before inviting my guest and even he spoke up and mentioned he wasn't impressed with the taste, and quality of the meal for the price and especially for the wait. I can't give an opinion on the rest of their menu to be honest. However if in the simplest of meals ever to come out of a Mexican kitchen which quite literally cost next to nothing to make, you don't hit it out of the ballpark... That speaks volumes of what I can expect from the rest of the menu offerings.</Review>

<Text>Snobby stuck up service, been coming here for 10years, I think they changed hands within the last couple years. They've gotten extremely cheap, the small town feeling is long gone here, they've even pulled certain salsas out of the salsa bar and charge for them up front. Most of what you expect to find at a 5star Mexican food establishment...you will no longer find here. Quite a shame. Luckily we found a decent place across the street.<//Text>< Pictures>

Friendly service. Enchilada sauce was tasty and not covered with cheese.  Fresh juices.  Lemonade was homemade not canned or bottled. Nice rustic decorations. Can't give a 5 because I've only been there once. Have to try more food<//Review>

<review>Probably never going back which is too bad because years ago it was a favorite for us.  Last several visits have been disappointing... Food just isn't what it used to be ( ie, carnitas are hard and dry) and even though we spent $100+ there today, they still charged us for green sauce 'because avacados are expensive'. Who does that?<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

The prices were not bad, the food was very tasty, and I love the salsa bar. They have 4 types of salsa and good guacamole. The decore was very nice and the tables are comfortable.  A good place to have a laid back lunch or dinner, and a good place to talk.< /review>

I believe they changed owners, I usually order carnitas quesadilla and usually it's grilled perfect and plump with meat. Ever since the change its skimpy and burnt to a crisp. Last time I'm going there.<//review>

< review>
Had to send my plate back twice. Tamale was freezer burn, chili relleno was very soggy. The only thing decent was burritos and chimichonga. I ordered a couple of chimichonga with asada and I got ground beef in BOTH of them. I tried to take them back but they wouldn't take them,they said they don't have ground beef. I felt insulted. I don't think I'll ever go there again. Bad service with a side of lies. The Mexican rice is good tho.</review>

<Review>This place has changed a lot recently..this used to be one of our faves in town, but these past few months, I've noticed the quality has really gone downhill. The carne is almost flavorless. I appreciate that their salsa bar is covered and kept refrigerated, that is definitely rare . They also have pickled cabbage in the salsa bar which is hard to find. Extra stars for that. Service is also very friendly. Horchata was a HUGE disappointment. For sit down, I still prefer this to else's, but to go, I would definitely choose la mexicana (the meat market).< /Review>< Rate>

I ordered a super burrito, carne asada and nachos with carne asada,  when we got food the carna asada was so cooked it was crunchy and there was no sour cream, guacamole or pico de gallo in my burrito.  I told them about it, they had to check ticket on what I had ordered.  Waiting no one said anything, went back up and so said they were bringing me sour cream.  That is how they do business.  I never did even get the sour cream, she took it to a different table.  No customer service at all.  I don't like this place, I only took my daughter there, she wanted it.    Was hoping they had changed, but no still suck.</text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) They take a long time to prepare the food and when they take it out is cold, the little too cold I asked to heat it up and they brought it back cold, in general very bad service

I come here every time I have a package to deliver. Whether it’s a gift or someone purchasing my art it always gets to its destination on time and very well taken care of. The workers and always friendly and very helpful. There is someone to help you before you get to a teller in case you have any questions. They keep the line moving even when it is busy, the flow is always steady. Always a good experience.<//review>

<user_name>Luis Castellanos</user_name>< Review>
Just terrible service and bad attitudes all around! That girl Abby or Addy is just plain awful. She started off on the wrong foot and ended with my attitude. Luckily because I am a nice person that's all she ended with. I am typically patient and understanding of government workers, but this lady was just gross. She made the interaction seem like it was my fault. Not sorry as I was told to do things a certain way by another USPS. I let her know that I was not the one she would be putting her frustrations towards.  She also mentioned that the day was going to be long. Lady check your attitude and mail your nasty attitude somewhere or get a different job!  Also you calling me an irate customer doesn't bother me your irate mood and attitude bug the hell out of me. Someone call the postmaster.< /Review>

The woman was terribly rude when I was unsure of what passport document I needed. They would not take me as I walked in and stated appointments were needed. She additionally made a snide remark to her co-worker as I was leaving.< /review>

Terrible customer service by the Latino employee (short old Latino lady) she probably thinks that by working for the USA post office she owns it.  It’s the closest post office near me but will not  go there. I go out of my way to use other offices around the area.  She should be let go and the building and landscape of the building and parking needs some TLC!! Linda is wonderful with her customer service but will not use this location ever again.  Absolutely disgusted by that short Mexican lady I didn’t even cared to get her name even though I should have.<//text>

Worst customer service ever! As LINDA was preparing my mail out request I asked her a simple question and she chose to just look at me and ignore it... ok. And then when she handed my change back she literally tossed it on the counter instead of placing it on my extended hand.<//Review>

<Review>There's plenty of services here that can be helpful to you.
But just for advice to anyone reading this: this is not the "main" USPS for Chula Vista, hence why it is kinda small but still great to have as a postal office.
Since I have ordered stuff internationally and I had to actually go to the 3rd Avenue one; just saying to anyone else that did an international order.

Overall my experience coming here is positive and would come back here if I need something.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>I went to this PO a week ago for my passport. The sign they had regarding walk ins was very misleading. The two ladies working were very rude, unhelpful and had the worst customer service I have ever incountered.  I wish I could have gotten their names. But they wouldn't even answer one question of mine.  No wonder why people turn to other means and you have offices closing. Maybe if you train your employees on customer service you won't have such poor reviews.< /review><response>None< /response><pictures>None</pictures><Rating>1< /Rating>< gmap_id>

This doesn't even deserve 1 star. I made a passport appt for 11am today, having arrived at the requested time of 10:45. Come 11:30, the representative deliberately took someone with an 11:15am appt before me despite me telling her I had an 11am appt and had been waiting for 45 minutes, and telling me to sit down and wait.

People have other things to do! And how  unbelievably rude.</Text>

Walked in a little after 10 on a Thursday morning, only one other customer ahead of me.  Linda assisted me and I was in and out in no time.  This is a great little Post Office out of the way of main stream Chula Vista.  I'll be back !!<//Text>

I go there once or twice a month and the service is horrible, it seems they're doing you a favor as if it was a free service; there is one young latina lady though that is very nice, however, she has not helped me directly, but I see how she really is service oriented to others that were fortunate enough...my luck =(...perhaps today I will get better luck and have her assist me.<//Review>

What a disappointment! Thought I'd use this office on my way to an appointmentIin Chula Visya.
I thought the main office on 3rd was bad with rudeness. The only two ladies there were helping one man. They didn't seem to understand how to help him. Within the 15 minutes that I was there,  in line, 2 people in front of me left and at least one behind me left. They were slower than any post office I have ever been in. The long wait with a bad back was so tiring and frustrating.   After being there 15 minutes without the line moving, I spoke up and asked the two ladies if there was a third person who could help the 8 people who were in line. No answer as they tried to hurry to help this man. Once I spoke up, there seemed to be an energy of complaints from the frustrating customers in the still line. After 20 minutes the next person in line was called and I, too, left. I will never use a Chula Vista post office again! Rudness and incompetence in a government run office! Someone needs to wake up! I am happy that i have respect for my city's post office.

I showed up 30 minutes early for my appointment to get a passport, and didn't even make it to the initial processing until 30 minutes AFTER my appointment time. Apparently the appointments are just a cover  The staff were rude, especially Calvin. All told: 1 hr 45 minutes in inadequate air conditioning with an unhappy toddler. I'll find a different office next time.<//Review>

One question they threw me from one office to another and at the end I lasted an hour wanting only information and they came out that they could no longer help me because they were already going to saw this is rude from the employees. I do not give any points to this office. Thank you for your bad attention.

(Translated by Google) I did not ask the name of that woman who was treating me but she is a despot and terrible person. Horrible customer service at this location. Very rude. I totally forgot to ask for her name. She doesn’t deserve to work in such an important place. Hopefully someone report her soon and get her out of there.
Hopefully someone reports it and gets it out soon.

Joe was amazing! He helped me get back on the road by ensuring me the team would take care of me. The mechanic identified the problem, communicated to reason for the issue, how he repaired it, and explained what I should know for future references regarding my tires and sensors. I'm so grateful for them! I was able to make my 110 mile trip and arrive in time for a very important appointment. Great service!!!!! I highly recommend this location.... and, they checked my spare to ensure it had air. Big two thumbs up!< /review>

Went to get a tire rotation, they came back with bogus prints regarding a damaged control arm - refused to do a tire rotation and tried to rob me for $430. Took my car to multiple mechanic inspections, all conclusive that nothing is wrong with my car besides a shock replacement. Don't waste your time or money with these people.< /review>

<Text>Saw this new place and wanted to try it out.

Sadly, they are unprofessional and extremely shady.  They will rob you.  The manager I talked too had a very bad attitude, and kept pushing stuff I know I didn't need.  Save your time and money and go somewhere else.  I honestly don't know how they are still in business.  An average of '1.8'  I don't think I've ever seen a business with this bad of a rating.  There is a reason for it.

update: Nov 2016.

Reading the other reviews, and still being optimistic I decided to use the services here.  Pleasant and calm staff made me feel like they were not under any pressure to up sale.  They showed me an issue with a bushing that was beginning to crack and said it may still be under the manufacturers warranty but it was not critical.  In comparison to the other reviews I can only.guess that they were reviewing another service station.  They even finished 20 minutes sooner than estimated.<//review>

Had a flat and they rotated my tires and filled it again instead of patching it so nothing was fixed. Charged over 600$ and also asked for the brakes to be replaced but it looks like I'm paying to still feel my ears bleed and fear for my life whenever I pray my car will stop. Never going back. Terrible service and it sucks to know they just took advantage of me like that. At least Discount Tire patched my tire up for free. Such a waste of time.< /Review>

Absolutely DO NOT bring your car here. I went in because my car was making a strange noise. They called me after an hour and a half to tell me the noise was due to the shocks, struts and tires needing to be replaced. 3 hrs later when I went to pick up my car, I paid $1500 and as I was walking out the door I was told "oh your car is still making that noise, we think maybe it's a bearing". I could not believe the audacity! Avoid this place, they WILL rip you off! Im currently working with Navy Legal to get them blacklisted for the Navy and Marine Corps.</Text>

I've been happy with all of my experiences here... (aside from the waiting part anyway)...and until recently... usually, you can talk them down on price...so, I don't think they are crooks like some here are saying.  I've always gotten reasonable prices.

Anytime they've come across something that needed to be done while doing a routine inspection, they've come in and asked me before doing anything to my car.

I will say.... add 30 mins-1 hour to whatever time limit they give you... cuz they are never right.

I'm sad to say that I  had a recent bad experience where customer service was slow, inefficient, and not really "service" at all.... they didn't even do my courtesy inspection and the only thing I needed done  was a brake fluid exchange and an oil change.... 4 hours later, I still didn't have my car back.... And the guy who was in charge of checking the cars out was ridiculously slow and rude!!! Unfortunately, I will be finding a new location.  I complained to the manager and nothing was done.< /Text>

I went to go get my Lyft and Uber inspection. As soon as the sales person came out he looked at my tires. He didn't check the tread depth. He said you need new tires. I just took it to the dealership and they said I have a good 6 to 10k before I need new tires. I don't feel this place is very honest. I'll just drive a little farther and get my inspection at Uber place in Mira Mesa.<//text>

Absolutely horrible unprofessional experience with both employees and business. They give a 1 hour estimate to repair a tire, 4.25 hours later it is still not fixed and I am forced to leave but they promise it will be ready first thing in the morning. I come back at 9AM after they have already been opened for a couple hours.
I ask for the manager and explain the situation, he has a horrible attitude, gives no apology and doesn't even bother to get up from his paperwork and even look into the issue.
Never buy Express Tire!</Text>

I always hate to take my car anywhere because Mechanics can tend to be pushy for all sorts of stuff. It is hard to discuss the need for service over a phone while your car is at a shop. That said I got exactly what I wanted with Express Tire. No pushing un-needed service. They only did what I asked them to do. They even caught an item that I had forgot to mention to them and new was a problem. I have taken all my cars to them since and been really happy.<//Text>

SCAM ARTIST MAJOR RIPOFF!!! My wife took her jeep here for an oil change special when they discovered a crack in the Radiator. They told us they could fix it it for 710$ and that if we didnt do it immediately her engine would blow. We declined the repair and shopped around. We found a place that replaced the radiator for 300$. Thats less than half the price express tires tried to quote us. Total scam, tell ur friends this place is out to rip you off<//Review>

Horrible waiting around without any updates. A 15 minute vehicle inspection takes them at least an hour or more to get done while the workers joke around in the back eating or talking about 1 vehicle instead of working on their separate jobs they're supposed to be handling. Had to get a manager to have my car taken out which had apparently already been sitting there done just waiting for them to retorque my wheels which for some reason were off for a simple inspection. Hear them try to rob another customer for parts he didn't need and keep pressuring him into commiting to a $1,500 bill on the spot. Make you think you're getting a good deal by discounting their original ludicrous price. That discounted price is still higher than most shops of similar size and I wouldn't trust them with any big job personally, considering its mostly fresh kids working in there aside from the service manager and 1 other guy I saw. An overpriced corporation-run shop relying on heavy profits from the naive. Shop around!< /Text>

<review>I went for an oil change and alignment. When i go to get car i asked for alignment specs after i payed and found out that there was no alignment spec sheet. They lied about the alignment they never did one but charged me. So once i knew i was lied to and robbed i decided to check the oil filter. I changed the oil and filter myself last time and i used a  Motorcraft filter. While the store manager stood there with me I asked what type of filter did you put on my car he gave me the name as i looked at the filter i knew that they did not change filter because my Motorcraft filter was still on car. Immediately I yelled at the store manager telling him they just robbed and lied to me. They charged me around $200 for nothing. They did no alignment and no oil and filter change and they new they were caught. they said they would do all the work again. I told them no I will be contacting my lawer and the BBB. Well 3 weeks later after going to court we settled out. DO NOT GO TO EXPRESS IN SANTEE THEY ROB STEAL LIE AND EVERYONE WORKING THERE ARE CROOKS AND LOW LIFES.</review>< pics>

<Review>Worst experience I've ever had at any repair/tire shop. I went in to get a 19 point vehicle inspection for uber and after an hour I go check on my car and they have it on the lift with all the tires removed! I ask them why they took my tires off and they told me that I need new tires. I told the guy to put my tires back on and give my car back. They seemed to be under the impression that they could just change all my tires out and then come tell me to pay for what they did without even asking me if I wanted new tires in the first place, or which tires I wanted.< /Review><Response>None</Response>< Date>

< review>
I call a head to see how long the wait would be to patch up my tire because it had a nail in it and I was told 30 to 45 minutes and it took them 30 minutes just to take my car to the back then it sat there for another 45 minutes because they started working on all I ask this that if it’s going to take long let the customer know because people are on a schedule and to take 2 hours to patch a hole in a tire is crazy and then when I ask the guy she said oh they sent everyone to lunch all at the same time and how the hell is that my problem this is ridiculous< /review>

One Santa Fe is an amazing property, and their front desk staff are the best. The property manager, Isaac Ali, does an amazing job at keeping the property pristine and accommodating to all residents. Love the events the office and staff host for the residents. The retail community shops are great, and there is something for everyone to enjoy. I would highly recommend this fine establishment to be your next home.< /text>

I can’t believe they show people units on this floor because the smell is nauseating. Also! Be prepared to park on the street even though you pay rent to live there because you will come home and drive through both parking lots and find ZERO spots. Some folks at the front desk are incredible and others won’t even pick up the phone. I thought the place was too good to be true and turns out my suspicions were right.<//Review>< pics>

Literally the worst rundown place to live ever. There are plenty of newer buildings with competent management and new ones every week becoming available. Do yourself a favor and truly think twice about living here...is it worth saving $100-150/month to live in hell? DO make sure to ask some residents about how they really feel living here....NOT in front of the leasing agent.< /review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>Horrible experience here . Dog owners leave their dogs in the balcony and they bark all day Non stop. Have tried to contact the owners, as well as the so called ' concierge' with no help. Have called front desk as well as asked them to help with the problem of dog barking noise. Can not sleep at all here since so many dogs barking OUT side  of their apartments. Feel this is neglect and should not be allowed here. The here people do not control their dogs. The elevators smell like pee and have seen accidents all over the hall. Literally dogs can be seen from the balcony running around and barking late night into wee hours and morning. The double paned windows are a joke. Walls are thin can hear everything. Between the train noise , street, and all the barking dogs in this complex not a peaceful place to live.<//review><rating>1<//rating>< date>

<date>1592260817381< /date><rating>1< /rating><Review>I've been a resident in this building for 5 years now, as of this posting the pool has been empty and out of commission for 10 months. There has been no reply from the office to emails about when it will be fixed, they just keep sending out notices that the pool is out. Seeing as the pool is the main amenity many of us once enjoyed, this is a massive upset that has zero hint of being resolved anytime soon. No compensation or plan of action has been offered from management. I will remove this review when the pool is up and running again.

UPDATE: 6/15/2020 - Still no progress and no updates on when the pool will be functioning again. The management is less than useful. Now that we're a couple stages into "re-opening" ala COVID - they have reopened the gym, but it's missing equipment and has broken equipment still in there. One of the two other jacuzzis is not functioning. General upkeep has been terrible. They are now offering $1,000 discount on renewal, a very poor offer when rent is greater than $3k/month. They basically don't have any concern for the service they're providing the tenants. If you're considering moving here: DONT.

They've had 3 months now during the shutdown to make ANY progress, yet they have failed, hard. We're now going on 10+ months without a pool and no end in sight. I imagine it'll EASILY be over a year we have been forced to pay top rates for community features we were promised and advertised, with no sign of management doing anything to make progress or make up for their horrible mistreatment of it's residents.<//Review>< pics>

TL;DR - Avoid this place is you want your home to be a place of ease and relaxation! Run, don't walk, away from this building, and save yourself guaranteed headaches.
1. My car was towed from the very parking lot I was told was okay to park in while charging my car because, as you'll see from the pictures below, the chargers are ALWAYS broken. I was told I could charge my car in a designated area as long as I moved it before 7 a.m. (at some point it was 8 a.m., but they keep changing the rules without any notice). The tow slip says they came at 4 a.m. The parking lot was completely empty (not in anyone's way) and wasn't notified or given a chance to move it (I live here; they have my phone and unit number). More than $500 down the drain! One receptionist said their staff usually never do do something like this, and that I should reach out to their managers. I did - multiple times - and not a single reply back from anyone.
2. The pool has been unusable for almost half a year, and doesn't seem to be fixed any time soon. Just a few stagnant, dirty inches of water in the pool and the jacuzzi.
3. Elevators are down on an occasional basis. At one point, all three of the elevators closest to our unit were down for days.
4. Fire alarms are extremely sensitive and go off at all times of the day, but especially at night when one is trying to sleep.
5. Demolishments in the metro yard right next door is aggressive, with every concrete wall that falls making it feel like the a 5.0 earthquake throughout the day.
6. My car was parked in the gated resident parking right under a security camera and was broken into (their gates also break constantly and are left open so anyone can go in and out). I requested to view the footage so I can complete my police report and they wouldn't let me view it or have a copy.
7. In general, they will lie, or provide false statements, as to what services they offer and what the guidelines are. Then, will arbitrarily change them and you may incur additional fees because of if. Like they way they decided to change the way they receive and disperse packages.

I cannot stress enough the headaches this building has put us through. Be skeptical of the 5-star ratings; reception has a sign asking for them. The only reason this place gets the one star is for *some* of their friendly reception and handy-worker staff.<//review>

<Text>Extremely poor management. Diamond scheduled a tour with me after many conversations to view two available one bedrooms. Within 24 hours both were gone but she didn’t bother to inform me even though she had all my contact info. I was on my way and called because I checked online and saw the units were no longer available. Diamond wasn’t even going to call me to let me know not to come! There were no other units within my price range available. Had I been told I could’ve completed an application and given a deposit to hold one of the units I would have. To me, this is very poor management. When I look for an appartment, management is key, especially when we are paying at least 2,300 for a one bedroom! I will definitely been taking my money elsewhere and I suggest you do the same.<//Text>< pictures>

The worst of the worst. I lived here for 4 years and would not recommend this property to anyone. I loved my apartment, but management made it unbearable to live there. Fire alarms would go off all times of the day and night. Management has zero compassion about residents. Shanique Drummond was probably the worse manager of them all.<//Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I drove from Alhambra for my appointment to view the property and the leasing consultant was not only 15 min late, but was completely clueless as to who I was or when our appointment was or what we spoke about via email; not to mention, I had already submitted an application, emailed them several times (without getting a response), requested to reserve the unit, and even informed them via email that I had the funds ready to reserve the unit whether it be in person or online. But there seemed to be something wrong with their online portal and the only response I received was to set up an appointment. And apparently, it was already rented but nobody even bothered to cancel the appointment with me. I read all the bad reviews and realized that they are true. I should have believed it. I like the area, the building, and the amenities but the leasing department is the worst. By far the worst I’ve ever dealt with in my life because it seems as if they just don’t care about people. I definitely don’t recommend.< /Text>< Response>

I love living in this community! The new management and staff are tremendous. The building is well maintained, in a great location and also offers free yoga classes in our own yoga room!

<text>There is a reason why so many people have left 1 star reviews for this apartment building. While the building itself is modern and in a nice area of the Arts District,  and the concierge staff are really great, the management is frustratingly bad. There are very high monthly fees - you get charged a mandatory $25/month for a trash pickup service to your door (even though there's trash chutes along the corridor), $20 for sewer, and $100 or more per month for electricity and water usage fees (water is split evenly between all apartments and always high, nothing can be done about it).

SECURITY DEPOSIT - Mandatory fees will be removed from your deposit
We left the apartment as clean as we found it moving in, but they remove what they call 'standard fees' from the security deposit, which includes a $165 cleaning fee, and $250 wall painting fee! After a lot of complaining they finally removed the cleaning fee but are still charging us a pro-rated wall painting fee (we lived there for 13 months, didn't paint or damage the walls, and filled in all picture hanging holes and repainted them with the correct color paint, but apparently that's still not enough). This is the first place I've lived in my life that I won't get my deposit back fully. We plan to fight it as it doesn't seem legal.

FRUSTRATING PRACTICES - charged $400 for parking in wrong spot in my apartment building (rather than a simple phone call to move).
Berkshire Communities employs a lot of temp workers so when we moved in they couldn't help with quite a few questions. When we moved into the apartment, the temp pointed out some parking spaces with large white signs that were for the Metro parking *but* didn't say that most of the 2nd floor parking is Metro only (with small floor-painted writing half-faded, much less obvious than the few large white signs). Within the first couple of weeks I accidentally parked in a spot one night and came down the next morning to find my car towed. I had to pay $400 to get the car back. Note I had a One Santa Fe resident parking sticker visible on my window screen. I parked the car at ~8pm and came down at 630am to find the car towed overnight. When I picked up the car, it had a big sticker on the driver's side of the windscreen that took me a lot of elbow grease to completely remove. All they needed to do was call me and I would have moved it immediately. The parking in building 100 is never full so this really was unnecessary. I contacted management about it but they just said there was nothing to be done. I asked them to please paint the faded floor writing for other residents, but they never did.

BUILDING LAYOUT
There is no access to stairwells except to exit, so when the elevators break (once our elevator was broken for 3 weeks) you have to walk to the other end of the building to use a different elevator as stairs are inaccessible. There is no way to access the gym/pool except by elevator, so again, when it broke, I had to walk the entirety of the building to go through another entrance area. If you live in the 100 building there is no access to the courtyard, so you have to exit the building to the street and re-enter through the drive-in entrance.

COMMUNITY FORUM shutdown
There used to be a residents online forum to chat, but when people noticed the high monthly fees being charged, and started talking about it on the forum, management shut it down! Luckily we saw this and spoke to management and they did reduce our monthly fees after that (apparently there was an 'error' in their overcharging us!).

HOT TUBS
Are excellent, generally very hot, with a great view of the city.<//text>< pics>

Apartment maintenance is the worst.   Apartments maitenance requests are not fixed the first time.  It takes two or three requests.  Hallways are dirty and smell.  The pool has been out of commission since October and the hot tub by the pool is not working either.< /text>

I had a little chat with Lilly over by the pool area and she really convinced me about checking out the place she actually gave me a full tour of the place trust me she had me hooked, she sent me down to the leasing office to talk to one of the leasing agents, when I went down to the office I met with Shanique the property manager do to the leasing agents being out to lunch. She was so helpful and she had a really nice attitude great customer service and definitely I would love to come back and rent here once my lease is over at my current place.< /Review><date>1520661184975<//date>< user_name>

UPDATE: so the main selling points of this apartment complex were the amenities and location for me...with that, the location is still great, but I've lived here for 9 months and of the 9 months, 7 of them I have been unable to use the pool that they boasted about upon showing their space. There have been numerous emails saying they're fixing it, then later stating that they will connect us with a local pool for us to use...there has been no deliverance of said claims however. I've reached out to the desk multiple times about this and now have called the property manager so I'm waiting to hear back, but for the amount of money everyone here pays on rent for and this to continue without any claims being fulfilled, I think residents should get a bit of reimbursement.

The elevators are also intermittently breaking and I can only imagine any person requiring one being stuck :/. As for me, it's been a pretty sizable inconvenience every time it happens, since I've been needing to transport large equipment.

I also am unsure of how safe/secure this building is, as a few nights ago at 5:30 am, someone tried to enter my apartment. I went to the office to inquire what that was about, and if they had changed the keys before I moved in, how many copies there were, etc. The desk did not seem worried about any of this, and simply made a note and told me to call them next time it happens. I was also told to not bother calling the cops. I honestly don't know what to make of this and have been since barricading my door each night as I sleep to better take my safety into my own hands.

I would also like to mention that all the appliances used in this building are subpar at best, or at least in my unit. I was constantly calling maintenance for them to fix my stove and garbage disposal, etc. I even took to learning how to fix these things myself as it was an inconvenience for the maintenance to come in when I work from home. The maintenance staff is friendly, however and now I have some handyman skills.

As for the fellow residents of this building, many are rather rude and ignorant as far as pet care and upkeep go. I have found dog fecal matter in the hallways numerous times...and once found a lovely little present of such left almost perfectly on my door mat. I would reccomed better enforcing pet care, because once you let a dog's mess sit there, other dogs thing it's okay to do the same and the problem continues.

Fire alarms also go off sporadically in the middle of the night....always awful to wake up to a blaring siren when you have to get up early the next day.< /Text>

You will Immediately Experience a Warm Sweet Respectful And Professional Demeanor from the Amazing NFC Amenity Staff. Staff Members Such as Dre, Kacey, Richard, Anthony, Jasmine Go Above and Beyond with their Customer service. Only One Issue is to Stay Away from the Female Director Francie Or Frenchy Whatever Name is. Her Service is NOT SO GOOD, VERY RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS. The Management Staff Is Also Good.<//text>

<Review>This place is fraudulent and scam artists. Had my car parked WITH parking pass visible yet they still towed my vehicle. $466 for towing yet they take no responsibility and I have no options. If I leave the car to fight the fees, they progressively increas so I am stuck with a gigantic bill nonetheless.
Don’t move in here and if you live here, move out. I plan to. Seriously disappointed.< /Review><name>Timothy Beyerle<//name>< Time>

Do you want to pay $3k to get harassed and micromanaged by management and the leasing office? Then don't attend to move to this place ever! Worst management in history. This people are very unprofessional and rude. They are constantly changing the policies and never advice the tenants then they want to hold you accountable for stupid things. They are always watching or spying on you.

It's a nice building and area but the whole management team will make you life miserable. It's not worthy. There are better places to live in the Arts District. I can't wait till my lease ends.

Do not attend to call management to resolve any issues. They are not on your side. They will accuse and give your attitude.

Worst place I’ve ever lived in my life. BIG change and decline in customer service and conditions since berkshire communities bought and took over this building in early 2018. As of late, the elevator has been broken for three weeks and management staff is impossible to communicate with. They are also NOT on your side. At one santa fe, the TENANT is the last on the totem pole and always wrong. Stay away from this place!

If you want to live in the Arts District, there are 100s of other new apartments with friendlier and more cooperative management. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼<//Review>

Property management is abysmal.  Current Manager Shanique Drummond is unprofessional, deceptive, interrupts you in mid sentence, raises her voice and does not respond to questions.  Security is non existent--you could be attacked in the long hallways and there are no protections in place.   You will be charged unreasonable fees with no explanation.   You will hear your neighbors walking above you.   Avoid this place like your life depends on it.</Review>

Big "A" Architecture with Big "O" Overrrated.

As a member of the architecture community, in all seriousness, I must review this one with no sarcasm nor wittiness yet with the same enthusiasm as the rest of my reviews.  This review will not critique the staff in which were stellar the day they gave employees of the architecture firm I work for (Gensler) an exclusive private open house which included tours, wine, and after party.

Typical Michael Maltzan building.  Designed as an white object only understood by seeing it from a mile in the sky.  Designed too big for its own good.  Someone with a lot of cash living somewhere far away decided to cram the most units they could into one thin strip and maximize their value.  Besides it's long linear form, it completely ignores and dwarfs everything around it (that's what she said! Okay that's my only one).

Lack of Human Scale

This portion is for you, the reader, the potential renter, the guy going for drinks at the restaurant below, the girl going to shop at the boutique store.  The complex may look great flying by at 60 mph but once you get out of the car and walk along the building, it lacks the single attribute a pedestrian would want in an experience.  That's human scale.

The amazing lifestyle that the renderings portrayed just doesn't exist because it just wasn't designed at that scale.  The bare and cold facades along with the lack of landscaping makes it a unbearable to walk along.  The same goes with all of the massive parking garages and eerie long hallways of the complex.

My last critique is on the little detail or lets call it ornamentation on the building, the window brise soleil.  It's obviously ornamentation for the building, because it shows up only on some windows yet not others.  The side of the building that I would say needs it most is the west facade yet they only show up on the east facade.  Some slightly north facing facades have them even though the sun never hits the window.  Sun studies people! Architecture 101.

Sorry Michael, this one was a flop, although I'm waiting for restaurants and shops to move in to see if life gets better on the ground floor.  Updates to come.< /review>

The location is a major plus, love the easy access to everything. And of course the washer & dryer in the  unit is a major plus and was a dealbreaker for me. Parking is another plus.  Love the many amenities that make this place the perfect place to live for an artist. Creativity is expressed in numerous ways in the Artist District and I love it! You can see the different expresion of independant thinking, no cookie cutter stores, shops and boutiques. Of course Satrbucks doesn't count.< /review>

<review>Very good Mexican food reminiscent of Central Mexico. Five tables, so there was a steady stream of customers getting food "to go" on Friday evening when my family was there. The cook was very friendly and explained the dishes. I had ground shrimp that was made into patties, served in enchilada sauce with cactus pieces, plus rice and frijoles. (Only down side was the TV was directly overhead and was too loud.)</review><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2d5f6577d5365:0xfd6f72af04757c29< /Gmap_id>< pics>

Rutland park is a nice place to take a morning jog or just to have a nice little picnic. It Isn't the biggest, but a nice roomy size for many.  Small playground but also has some basketball courts and a volleyball net.  Large grassy area at the back and I will add pictures for reference.<//text>

Magnolias are in bloom this time of year. Great place to exercise or bring your family, walk your dog, relax under the shade of the trees, etc. But there are no restrooms.< /text>

I began to visit Rutland park with my eldest daughter back in 1995. I have nothing but good things to say about this quiet, very small but nicely kept kid-friendly community park.. Residents are keeping it a safe and clean environment for the rest of the community and I think that's great! 👍<//Text>

Beautiful yet quaint small park, I especially love the track that is lined with workout equipment. It is moderately clean and very lovely with a wonderful view of a small desert-like background brimming with wildlife. I'd love to visit again.< /review>

Its overall a good park except there is no bathroom wich sucks. Usually pretty clean and very rarely do u see any transit there. Nevrr usually crowded. Grest for walking the track and letting your kids play. My kids always have fun here. Just no bathroom is the down fall.</Review>

(Translated by Google) I love this park, it is clean and what I like the most is seeing young people and children having fun. Older people enjoy the tranquility of the place.

(Translated by Google) It is a quiet place, and only has four kiosks. Only one of them is roofed against the rain, and has a grill, ideal for parties or social gatherings with friends

< Review>
We came in to see Esther the day after my 4-year old was scratched in the eye and face by a large puppy. She examined her eyes and made sure her vision was okay, and took several images to double check. We felt a huge relief after knowing that her cornea was in good shape and healing properly. Esther was very knowledgeable, understanding and patient with my child, who is also very active. We also come here as a family for our annual eye exams, and highly recommend this place! The staff is always so accommodating and kind. We’ve been to a few places and have finally found a good fit for our family. 🙂< /Review>

It's a comfort and security to be able to have a medical support team that treats you like family and genuinely care about your well being and health. I always leave the facility knowing that they looked out for my best interest today and the future. Thank you for all you do and care.</Review>

I have been going to Esther Ahn Optometry for years now. I recently moved to Tustin and I intend to continue going to see her. They make such an effort to sanitize the office and keep it clean and safe. The staff is very friendly and I feel very comfortable there. Esther Ahn is such a beautiful, caring and nice person. She is thorough with the exam and explains everything. She even gives helpful tips. It’s always a pleasure going to see her.</Text>

I have been a patient of Dr. Ahn for more than 15 years. Sam and Kevin were attending to me for several years and I really appreciate their help.  I always recommend this place to all my family and friends.< /Text>< time>

Great experience! Came to get an annual eye exam. Felt very safe - staff used various COVID safety procedures (e.g. make you wait outside until it's your turn for appt, sanitize equipment after use, wear gloves when handling glasses, etc. Esther Ahn was very meticulous during the eye exam process and answered any q's I had in regards to my eyes. In the end she recommended me not to change my current prescription. Will come back again!<//Text>

<Text>I've been a patient of Dr. Ahn for almost 10 years and I am so grateful i found her.  Not only is she so thorough, they always have a wide variety of frames to choose from.  Thru the pandemic, they made me feel safe and kept everything so clean. They even disinfected my debit card after handling it in at time of checkout.

Dr. Patel is a knowledgeable, patient, friendly eye Dr. who took her time to explain everything thoroughly  during my appointment. In addition, every precaution was taken by Dr. Patel and staff  to ensure strict hygiene and disinfecting guidelines were provided.
The rest of staff was also very helpful, polite and knowledgeable. I also was impressed how clean and modern office looked and their variety of eye glasses.
I will definitely return to this place and highly recommend this Optometry place.< /Text>

I have been a customer here since the 2000s and have always been extremely satisfied with the service and care I received.

Dr. Ahn and the staff are very professional and knowledgeable, and they genuinely have the best interest of their customers in mind. I recently had difficulty getting the prescription right for my contact lenses, and everyone in the office worked with me so tirelessly to make sure I was 100% happy with the contacts. Despite requiring multiple visits and phone calls to the office (especially during the pandemic when they could only accommodate limited number of customers a day), I always felt welcomed and got the help I needed.

The office is always clean, and with COVID they have been especially conscious about sanitization and social distancing. They require temperature checks before entering the office.

If you want professional, high standard service for glasses and/or contacts fitting, this is the perfect place to get it done right!< /Text>

<text>Very detailed!  I was surprised to see Dr. Ahn herself doing everything for me during the exam, but that is the biggest plus. Thank you Dr. Ahn. The staff Kevin is also knowledgeable with his realm...<//text>< Time>

<review>Very detailed oriented and knowledgeable staff. Dr. Ahn was very thorough and informative throughout my appointment. She explained every point of the exam and concluded with my best option. In this Covid time the office is on point with all protocols and is super clean and disinfects continuously. Clean, comfortable, and professional. Thank you.

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>I started going to Esther Ahn Optometry in 2018.  The whole team is incredibly kind and caring.  I see Dr. Patel when I have my eye exams.  She is very thorough and explains everything to me. She’s also very personable and makes the whole process very comfortable. The staff in the front is also very helpful when assisting with frames and payment. Soo is a total sweetheart and gives great advice when picking frames.  She explains the insurance coverage and pricing along with any other discounts, like purchasing a 2nd pair.  They have a great selection of frames to choose from as well.  The sunglasses are a little limited, but I was able to find a pair I liked.  Also, they have adapted very well to the new safety measures in place due to COVID. Their office and exam rooms have seemed very clean from the get-go, but even more so now.  They have the counters distanced from one another so that patients can wait without being right next to each other.  They limit how many staff members you have contact with and they wear masks and face shields the whole time. They sanitize everything really well and have hand sanitizer available for patients.  All in all, this team is amazing and I’m very glad I found them and made the switch.</review><Resp>None</Resp>< Rate>

I had a really awesome experience today at this office. Dr. Yoon was very informative and thorough during my eye exam and had a very gentle and calming demeanor. The optician Sam was knowledgeable, kind, helpful, and didn't put any pressure to pick certain frames or rush me at all. Although I took a lot of time to choose, Sam was really understanding and gave me a lot of knowledge and feedback regarding picking the right frames for me. Great staff and great experience :)< /Text>

My experience here was phenomenal!! Dr. Esther Ahn was so informative, trusting, and clearly has a passion for her career. She really cares about her patients. I have never had an experience like today at other optometrist. I am now a permanent patient here, and recommend this office to anyone seeking for a Dr. that won’t rush you out the door, but instead take their time to get to know you and explain to you the treatment being done.< /Review>

I've been going to Dr. Esther Ahn for over and her clinic provides the best customer service. They carefully make sure that glasses/contacts are comfortable and fit perfectly.

Their handling of COVID-19 has been splendid also. They follow the health instructions strictly so that your health and theirs are safe. Please have patience scheduling appointments with them during this time as it appears they can't take as many patients in a day as before.</review>

< review>
As much as I want to support the local businesses, I highly do NOT recommend doing business that lacks integrity and blames their customers. I resorted to filing a complaint with the California Board of Optometry (Board) for the reason below.

I’ve visited this optometry in the past to get an eye exam (contact and lens) and to order new contact and spectacle lens using insurance. The eye exams provided by the licensed optometrists have been great without any issues. But the latest experience was questionable and distasteful in regards to their business practice.

The optometrist had completed the eye exam and afterward, the staff (optician?) guided me to another room to conduct the optomap exam ($49 not covered by insurance). Never did the optician informed me that there is an extra cost to this extra service. Afterward, had a consultation with another optician to replace the lens on existing glasses, and it went downhill from here. I’ve asked if it’s possible to get my pair of backup glasses cleaned and shown him the lens that had spray paints on it. Keep in mind the lens is not smeared in white paint but the overspray getting to the lens, tiny dots of white paint. The optician said he will try and came back with what appeared to have rendered the lens useless, ruining the top coat with smears. Mind you there were no smears on the top coating at all. The optometrist refused to fix this issue and the optician blamed the aging and wear and tear. If the optician was experienced and helps patients daily cleaning their glasses, he should have known better and advised the patient that they are not able to remove it rather than ruining the lens.

I had to visit the optometrist the second to bring up this issue with the manager, but they said they will only offer a special discount (which I’ve never received), and the owner, Dr. Ahn didn’t even bother acknowledging me during this visit when I was the only customer during the Covid19 lockdown. The first visit, which was unnecessary and a waste of my time, was because the optician forgot to add the transition/photochromic order to the spectacle lens so I had to drive to the store for them to correct their mistake.

After filing a formal complaint with the Board did Dr. Ahn emailed me to offer the free replacement of the backup glasses. The complaint against Dr. Esther Ahn Optometry was for several reasons but I’ll only point to one violation here. The optometry has been incorrectly issuing spectacle lens prescriptions for only one year rather than two years as required by the California Business and Professions Code §2541.1(b). The optometry responded to the Board that their software vendor had set the default setting to one year. In my opinion, the optometry was negligent by not verifying and changing the software setting. This only means the optometry has been prescribing incorrect spectacle lens prescriptions to hundreds and thousands of patients for however many years.

Please check your prescriptions and if this optometry had prescribed you for only one year recently, file a complaint with the Board.< /review>

This office has always been welcoming. Just went in for my annual checkup post COVID and I am very impressed! They schedule only one patient per hour and to ensure their staff safety they have a health questionnaire and do a temperature check upon arrival. Per Dr. Ahn they rotate their staff and their doctors to ensure just in case someone gets sick it doesn’t affect their whole staff. As a healthcare worker myself, I appreciate what precautions have been put in place! Thank you Dr. Ahn!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Nice staff, high tech eye exam equipment, and also very kind and knowledgeable doctor.

Most of my previous experiences related to medical offices were bad because of their poor service and attitude.

However, this place is different. I have no regrets choosing Esther Ahn Optometry.

Highly recommend this place!</Text>

<Date>1573795556664<//Date><Rating>3< /Rating><review>I've been coming to this optometry office for awhile now and while all the doctors I've seen have been informative and friendly, what concerns me is the constant change of office workers. Except for a couple of people who I've come to known after going yearly, I always encounter new workers each year.

I guess most people would not consider this an issue, but I feel like this year, the quality of service was not as up to par as other years. Last year, I was greeted upon entry by a young Filipino(?) gentlemen was super welcoming and kind. This year, I was greeted halfheartedly by a middle aged Korean(?) woman with short-shoulder length hair sitting at the front desk. She didn't offer a smile and when I finished filling out the form, she took it back without even making eye-contact or a word of thanks. Perhaps she was having an off-day? She was not wearing the same kind of uniform as the others. If that means she is in a higher position, I would hope that means she has been in the industry for awhile and knows how to act professionally.

Overall, I just could not help but realize the difference. It seems as if many of the coworkers who helped me before and I had hoped were here to help me again are no longer there. Even the old office manager, who I had gotten to know, no longer works there either. It is a shame since Favi was always super informative, helpful, and quick about her work. A large turnover rate is not a good sign for the management. And it can't help but feel a little confused and apprehensive in regards to the ever-changing staff.<//review>< Pictures>

Dr Esther Ahn and her entire staff are amazingly wonderful. I inherited Dr Ahn when she bought the business about 15 years ago & I wouldn't go ANYWHERE else.  The entire office is professional and personal at the same time, putting you at ease.
They're always learning & getting the newest technology to service patients. They have a big selection of frames, contacts & sunglasses. They take insurance, cash & credit cards. Get your eyes checked this month!< /Review>

<Text>Dr. Ahn is the best! I’ve been seeing her since I was 6 years old and recently moved out of state but I still come back to get my eyes checked out by her. The rest of her office staff is also very efficient and friendly. I definitely recommend her, if you are looking for a caring and knowledgeable optometrist.< /Text>< Pictures>

Dr. Ahn carved time out of her busy schedule to check my glasses and answer some questions. Dr. Ahn is superior in her knowldege of optometry and anatomy of the eye. She solves problems professionally, respectfully, patiently and is always transparent while she  puts her clients at ease and gains their highest levels of trust... I highly recommend Dr. Ahn and her staff to anyone that needs a 5 star optometrist...

11/18/2019

I stand by my last post... Dr. Ahn is a credit to the optometry medical community and profession. Dr. Ahn answers questions directly, thoroughly and with kindness, gentleness and an extremely high level intelligence. Some new (to me) office staff are efficient knowledgeable, welcoming...great people to be the first contact and to help with glasses or contact lenses. If you want a 5 star optometrist then Dr. Ahn and staff are what you want, Look no further!< /text>

<Gmap_id>0x80dd2da664d582c3:0xbb45f03b091921d8< /Gmap_id><review>I've worn glasses practically for all my life and I think I have been to at least 5 different optometries/eye glasses stores in LA and Orange county. I've had some good ones and some bad ones, but this one is exceptional. I will be honest. I am not an expert in the field (like most other reviewers here) so I can't really judge about the quality of their professional opinions/prescription. All I can say is that they seem to know what they are doing. But one thing I can tell for sure is that they are genuine people who really care about the customers. You can really feel the difference from the manner with which they treat the customers. My 5 year old son who we had found out to have an astigmatism has been successful wearing an eye glasses for 2 months and it feels good to have someone whom we know we can depend on to continue to monitor his condition for many years to come. His 9 year old sister is also having a blast whenever we visit the store because everyone is so nice to her.</review>< rating>

I really would give 5 STARS, but want this review to show it's real.They treated me great when I walked in. Let the Doc,whichever one you see, know exactly your problems and they will find the right way to examine you and how to form your percription for contacts or glasses<//text>

<text>Dr. Ahn's clinic is clean. Staffs are friendly. Sam asked my glasses to do a test and returned me a shiny one. When Sam gave me vision tests, he explained each test to me. I am so appreciate his services. Dr. Ahn was very patient to do tests.<//text><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I have been going to Dr. Ahn for more than ten years. The entire staff is always very professional and the evaluations could not be any better. I highly recommend this optometry office!<//text>

Before Esther Ahn's optometry, I went to another one in Garden Grove for years. They were nice and everything was done well, but Esther Ahn's optometry is exponentially better! Everyone is extremely friendly and very professional. It's refreshing to walk into a place filled with smiles. From the pre-examination to the actual exam with the doctor, every step was very clearly explained. The staff was also very helpful in picking out good glasses for myself. I have no eye for fashion, so the assistance was very welcome. My time here was wonderful! If you're looking for an optometry, stop searching and come here.< /Text>

Excellent overall experience as always. From checking in for my appointment through my eye exam and selection of my new frames. I have been a patient for over 4 years now and will keep coming back.<//review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I don't recommend this place. Waiting 3 weeks for my glasses( taking too long) but still not complete. I had to go there three times again after that. Staffs tried to hide their mistake. Finally, I had to cancel the order.  Don't go there-not worth your time or money. Horrible customer service.<//Review>< pics>

Small and quiet spot for Southeast Asian food. Menu selection is not that wide but the food has authentic flavors and dishes you can not find in most other places. The people working here are efficient. The interior space, decor, cutlery and overall vibe sadly still have a lot of room for improvement.< /review>

<text>Good place for lunch or snack. I have had the Char Kuay Teow and the Coconut Laksa. Both are very good. I know I should try other things on the menu too, but these are just so good that I don't want to try anything else! lol

also their kopi is pretty decent

they take to-go orders over the phone, so you can call it in and pick up. Nice people working there too.</text><Name>David Randall</Name><userid>103836539194615027692< /userid>< Pics>

<text>The food is so delicious here. I had the #8 Indonesian Fried Noodle (Mee goreng) and fried tofu. The place is small but there was plenty of seating. If you walk by the place, you will miss it unless you are looking for it. The owners are from Indonesia and Singapore and so the cuisine consists of dishes from the region. They are very friendly. I highly recommend this place!<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1oYvQYQOuzMKk6FcQHMHkluI041QBGLBHtAA4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><user_id>104532957490522354371</user_id>< Name>

Excerpt from Eat the World Los Angeles:
If you have ever traveled in Singapore and some of the larger cities of Malaysia and Indonesia, the letter Q used twice in names will be very familiar. Small street vendors, hawker stalls, and full restaurants all use it similarly, most of which have nothing to do with each other. The term originated in Taiwan and has spread throughout the Chinese-speaking world with many meanings and usages.

In terms of food, the literal translation is akin to "chewy," the Taiwanese version of which sounds like the way people say the letter Q in English. Chewy does not tell the whole story of QQ though, as it implies that the item in question has a good resistance and mouthfeel. Not too soft, a good bounce, nice and chewy.

A good introduction and a wonderful barometer of how satisfying the QQ here will be is a handsome plate of Singapore char kway teow ($9.95). Also full of the other textures from meats, vegetables, and egg, the broad flat noodles have some of the best QQ in town and are the perfect vehicle for a well-balanced blend of seasoning and good spice level. Each bite of the char kway teow reveals a deep level of skill by the chef and just the right amount of each ingredient. When the meats (beef, Taiwanese sausage, shrimp) and vegetables are slightly charred, they give the surrounding elements even more flavor, a technique Cantonese chefs describe as "wok hei" or "wok's breath" in English. This simple phrase might be the best way to describe the simple satisfaction that comes from eating the dish.<//Text><user_name>Jared Cohee<//user_name><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAy_zZU6bOjTEcpjmcAd7KdD0dJYFy6R4U_OFL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPe4_gxTkHZiW2bsIImlC_Tbk0zvHStO8n5pYAn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdzPAq4SPQbNcdMEPz3KuBGf56yvuOR8-3tSnK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

Is right across the street from Pasadena City College. 1 hour Street parking only. They cater to the students and workers around the area.  We couldn't stay long because Pasadena parking enforcement is very active here so 1 hour means you can't really be having much of a conversation with any gatherings. We tried the laksa and char away teow. Both were flavorful and is close enough to what you get in Singapore. No fried pieces of pork fat here. Laksa taste from the $4 packs from the Asian supermarket is stronger than what's served here for $9.95. char away teow is not using the dark sweet thick soy sauce used in Singapore. No cockles (blood clams, "ham"). Kopi at $2.95 is not thick nor strong enough like what you get in Singapore. Kopi-C tasted a little too much like instant.  Evaporated milk taste was present. Still a good place to get something similar to what you get in Singapore. Much better than the fake panasia place.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Tiny, friendly Singapore-style coffee shop across the street from Pasadena CC. It took a moment to convince the disbelieving owners that we were legit in our request for everything extra-spicy, but they eventually made with a delicious chili sauce that brought it all home. High marks for the Indonesian-style fried rice, which was spiced up with fresh green chilies, and the popcorn chicken. Any place rocking the Milo Dinosaur is 100% ok with us.</text>

If you are Singaporean or Malaysian and longing for food from home, then this is the place to find it. Selection is very limited but the Laksa and Char Kway Teow is second to none in the greater Los Angeles area.<//text>

I would stay away from QQ Kopitiam. The last time we ate there our family got stomach flu and cold for 2 months. Then we get better and tried again and right away after the meal, my family was fighting with a terrible cough and my son had a stomach ache. Not to mentioned they gave us the wrong order, pricy and very small portion but I question their hygiene</review>

< Review>
Small fast food outpost serving inexpensive Asian dishes. Most items on the menu are good, not great. Laksa is the curry style rather than the assam style. The test of any Hainanese chicken rice dish is the rice and the one here is not fragrant at all. Still, if you're looking for Indonesian, Singaporean or Malaysian food in a pinch, this place would serve you well.< /Review>

<review>They're always so warm and welcoming. They have been doing an awesome job at keeping everything up to standards for covid. Everyone there does a great job. Whenever they're busy they still take their time to make sure you are satisfied with your service. They do a really nice job on my pedicures and manicures. I will always recommend my friends to come here.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Will never go again! I decided to give this nail shop a try because it is across the street from where I live and I was in a bit of a hurry. I was there for 3 hours. Within 1 week my nails were lifting and 2 nails had fallen off. I went back to show them and have them fix my Nails. The man whom I believe is the owner was extremely rude! I was asked what it is that I want them to do so I responded I would like for then to fix my nails as it had been a week. As he was fixing my nails he told me it was my fault and I must have oily nails/skin. I let him know I get my nails done regularly, every 2/3 weeks and this has never happened. He proceeded to file my nails aggressively and ended up filing my skin and making one of my fingers bleed really bad all while telling me if I don't like his nail service I can go back to wherever I went to before. As this point I did stop him and told him I was done and walked out.  Never in my life have I done this at any establishment. Then again I have never been talked to in the manner that he did. I will never recommend this place to anyone. They have horrible customer service!</review>

<text>Been coming to this place since 2001. Never had a major problem ever. Had one small problem years ago with a new girl who cut my skin too deep on my toe. However the next day the owner made sure it got fixed.  The girl didn’t last very long there. Definitely make an appointment.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<resp>None</resp><Text>This place sucks at doing nails. I went to try this place on Valentine’s Day for my first time. They left my nails super thin and 3 days later 2 nails broke in half without me hurting them. The rest of the nails were very easy to bend which ended up breaking in a less than a week. Never going back here it was such a waste of money.<//Text><Date>1519624263163<//Date><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Was in town visiting family from back East. Stopped in to try it.

Had the honey turkey club sub sandwich. It was over stuffed and extra hardy.

The staff was very friendly. You could tell they take pride in their business.

Definitely worth the trip if you are in the area.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Great fresh food, very clean place and great pricing. The gentlemen at the counter was super attentive and I was in awe of how fresh everything was.... only suggestion I would have is to maybe add a little background music. Besides that, it was Great! Food was so nice :) inside is clean and owner is so kind. Taking time to make it but it deserve because inside of the sandwich is full of fresh meet and vegetables. You can make hot sandwich as make warm up the meet.<//Text>< Pictures>

Excellent sandwhich. Bread was fresh. Generous amount of meat. The place doesn't look like much on the inside, but don't be fooled. I will definitely be going back.</Text>

It is an ok place. Not what i expected from a place selling Boreshead meat. It was cheap ingredients with not very much flavor for a $9 sandwich.< /Review>

Amazing sandwiches and friendly service. Great portion sizes on meats and they only use good quality ingredients. They use Boar’s Head Meats and Cheeses - good stuff! Fills up quickly at lunchtime. Have been around 5 times to date and consistently good service and great food. I’ve attached a picture of the menu - try it out sometime!<//Text>

Wow! What a great sandwich! I had the Ruben. It was the perfect amount of meat and fixings. Service was quick and the shop is very clean. Right off the fwy too. Awesome sandwich shop! Will definitely be back! Don't forget to tip your sandwich makers. They are worth it!<//Text>

Tony is fantastic! Always knows my order, and the order of everyone I walk in with. He has an incredible memory, and seems to always be in a good mood. The place is spotless, kept really clean, and the sandwiches are absolutely awesome. Highly recommend.<//text>

The picture displays of each of item is a blessing and a curse. On one end it makes your mouth water. On the other hand you get your sandwich and it does not look the same.
My time going in I was behind 1 other with a slightly larger order. One staff member made nearly the entire order as well as ours while the others stood around the wait was quite lengthy.
This is just a nitpick but the walls are very bare. Hopefully in time they can build a nice modern look to drawn in customers to stay longer.

The real test here of course is the food. The price is a little unbelievable. For what could get you 2 "foot longs" at competitive sandwich places (around 11 dollars). Besides that, I ordered the Fonz triple star. The flavors. The flavors explode and hit all the right places. This spot could be the place to be if it just felt more inviting and quicker paced... And if the price didn't seem so steep.

All in all the sandwich has me wanting those flavors but seeing the simple ingredients I don't know if Id want to pay that price from something I can grab from my local grocery store .</Review>

<Review>Very good and clean place. Fresh sandwiches and BOARS HEAD meats. 10/10 would recommend
Edit: went back for a 2nd time and just as good as the first. They give you an INCH thick of deli meat.< /Review>< pics>

It is worth noting...you can text your order to Nano's and you'll get a confirmation with an approximate time your order will be ready. I ordered the 2 Meats Nano(w/ Cajun Turkey and Roast Beef) on Squaw bread with Swiss. DELICIOUS!!! Kudos to Boars Head for making mouthwatering deli meats, and thank you Nanos for making sure that there is a generous amount of the meat so that I can taste it. I have never seen such a heaping portion of meat(a hand full would be accurate). The bread was fresh-not soggy. Veggies are fresh and compliment the meat and bread perfectly. Word to the wise...I enjoyed every last bite...but it's fair to say that the combo of cajun Mayo & Turkey left a little heat behind! 🏆🥪🥇</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

You will not find a better vet anyplace. The staff is friendly, helpful and always on top of things. The small animal vet, Dr. Bear, is an amazing guy. He is so good with our cats, I feel completely at ease when we visit. We first met him when I called to inquire about getting our goat's feet trimmed and he came out to the house and did a remarkable job. We have been loyal customers ever since. A bonus is the clinic is in Blossom Valley it's always quiet and peaceful. The waiting area is outdoors, in the shade, great place to hang out. They also throw an annual Christmas party with food and live music for their customers!< /text>

We saw Dr. Aaron Harlan for our three new goat babies for vaccines and castration.  We are new to owning goats as pets and Dr. Harlan was fantastic!  He was patient, very informative, answered every question we had, showed us what to look for in goats and how to trim their hooves.  So happy we have a local vet who understands livestock as pets!</Review>

We have been going to them for years and loved them.  But they've become so popular now that their old clients suffer for the sake of all the new people.  You have to book weeks in advance, so that pretty much limits it to strictly routine work - if you have a problem or an emergency, you're on your own.  No consideration for long-time patients whatsoever. That is no way to run a veterinary office.  I'm looking elsewhere.</text>

These are by far the kindest people that you could ever take care of your pets. We took our cat Missy there for end of life care and the entire staff was so understanding and really cared about Missy.< /review>

<Review>Dr. Manring did a great job the other day with my old pony, she pulled a tooth along with other maintenance, all while providing some excellent advice about the proper way to feed and care for him in his older years. So he can live the happiest most comfortable life. I like her proactive/preventative approach to equine health.</Review></record></dataset><record>

We used this place with Kasey and now with Ellie.
Much warmer environment than regular vet. Doesn't smell like a vet's office. They provide great service.
So glad we found this place in Blossom Valley.< /Review>

First time at ECLAP - fantastic experience. We left our old vet after the practice switched hands and we weren’t happy with the quality of service.

From the start- our vet tech was very professional and had a demeanor that made me feel like this practice had their act together. She took my pack into the office with confidence and control.

After their checkup, Dr. Christel came out to talk to me. Even though she is young, this veterinarian is extremely knowledgeable. She answered all of my questions in plain English.  I’m very happy with the service we got and I’ve found my new vet!< /Text>

I did not wait long until my dogs were taken back.  The vet met with me after their exams and went through each dog individually.  I had inquired about teeth cleaning for both dogs and was told only one needed it.  I appreciate them being honest and not performing services that are not necessary.  Overall, it was a good experience.  I had to wait several weeks to get my appointment.  I hope in the future that if they need to be seen for something more urgent that I am able to get in.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80d95f61e1666133:0x2c331ec580442730<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is our first visit to this Vet. I have a small dog and he did great. Thank you to Vet Rebecca and Kelly. Kelly was kind and made an effort to comfort Bear before his Exam and shots. Vet Rebecca answered all my questions and explained things I hadn’t thought of. She’s fantastic!  The cost of this visit was
less than I expected. Our previous Vet was so expensive compared to our new Vet. An example: Bear has appointment with our new Vet for his teeth next month and the old Vet estimate was double that amount. Check them out!</Text>

<text>We've been bringing our pets for their 6-7 years now, & they now have no availability for right away needs like they used to, & referred us to El Cajon walk in place. I've referred people to go here & will no longer do so because of this. You should always leave open spaces for right away needs of your current patients or hire vet that is there for that specifically. Very disappointed now.< /text>< pictures>

I've had animals all my life and interacted with many vet clinics.  Most have been really good but the entire staff and the care provided, to our family pets, by Dr Christel and Vet Tech Irene, has been EXCEPTIONAL each time!

Highly recommend!!<//text>

So glad we made the move to ECLAP!  The staff is so pleasant and patient. The Drs. have been wonderful. Explain everything before procedures, keep in touch during surgeries, and are very thorough with aftercare instructions. I have witnessed other patients arrive with an emergency and they were dealt with immediately and with compassion. The practice is very busy but appointment scheduling is reasonable. A+ on all fronts. I know are cat and dog are getting the best care possible. Thank you ECLAP!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</review>

<time>1605115540715< /time><rating>5<//rating><text>This was our first time to this veterinarian clinic. The Vet tech and doctor both came out to speak to me, even though I could not go in and both were very patient with my dog who was very excited and full energy. My dog has not run in over 2 weeks and he pulled on his leash but the vet tech was very patient and did not rush him. They were on time and thorough and the value of care for the price was exceptional. Bonus is the location is set on this beautiful ranch and farm and it feels like Dr Doolittle which seems how all vets should feel.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Time>1620486019417< /Time><Text>My dog had ACL surgery on her back leg in September and now needed her opposite leg ACL repaired. The only problem was my vet I found out is no longer practicing and taking my dog somewhere new to get surgery was really scary and stressful. After talking to a handful of friends I decided to try ECLAP and could not be happier with my experience! We’re on day 2 of her recovery and she has been eating, drinking and going to the bathroom like normal which was not the case last time at all. The entire staff is so friendly, helpful and their compassion and love for animals is very obvious. What more could you want as a pet owner?! I 100% recommend ECLAP!</Text><userid>109645005917777649270</userid><name>madeline cartwright<//name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>With what I thought was our last good byes with our Little dog, and thinking we were going to have to put her down due to what appeared to be a tumor, Dr. Manring spent the time to evaluate and decided we would treat her rather than just putting her down and I’m glad. Our precious little dog is doing fine. What I thought was a tumor just turned out to be an infection and was diagnosed properly. Dr. Manring did not mess with our emotions (like many other Veternarian’s) yet calmed us by letting us know all of our options up front. Not once did she mention money during the evaluation like I had received at every other Veternarian that I have had to deal with in the past (other locations).

East County Large & Small Animal Practice Is very professional and caring. I will continue to use them for all of our animal care needs. I will recommend them to everyone...

Thank you Caitlin, you saved my dogs life!</Text>< pictures>

Very happy we decided to go to ECLAP for a second opinion for our dog. The staff and Doctor(s) were SO kind, their prices are INCREDIBLE, and the location is great. So clean and animal friendly, we felt right at home. We are definitely making ECLAP our new permanent vet office! It's about a 40 minutes travel for me, but WELLLLL worth it! :)</Text>

Caitlin was amazing. We left with my kids saying she could be one of the family. Caitlin took care of our badly injured baby alpaca in an emergency situation. We didn't know where else to go so from San Diego's North County to East County took over an hour but Caitlin took AMAZING  care of us and our baby. I will gladly go the hour to see her again!!!! Thank you!!!!</text>

We have had a couple of our animals go here (pot belly pig and goat.) This past weekend a couple of our chickens were very sick and it was a Sunday.  We were able to make after hours call and spoke to vet.  We drove to El Cajon and pick up medications for the girls.  We would have lost them had it not been for ECLAP.  We are a few days into the medication and the girls are feeling much better and back to happy, healthy chickens.<//Text>

They are all amazing! I took my 2 year old Great Dane in to get fixed yesterday and they went above and beyond! Cleaned his ears, trimmed his nails, gave him all the love and cuddles and helped me wrangle Him into my car and took him on the side entrance bc he isn’t used to other dogs he doesn’t know. The best experience ever never ever taking my animals
Anywhere but there.<//Text>

The staff, even at their busiest, check in on those who are waiting and then hurry off to give their full attention to whichever client is next. You can tell there’s an effective system in place to handle the rush of appointments. Sure, if you’re here during their peak time, you might be waiting for a moment but the proof is in front of you with how hard they’re working! Each pet is greeted with a genuine smile. Their prices are fair and I never walk away feeling cheated. Props to this team! Thanks for being here for our furry family members :)</Text>< Pictures>

We brought our mini dachshund Delilah here to get spayed and had a great experience. All the staff were incredibly friendly and made a scared little weenie dog feel comfortable. I received a call once she was in surgery letting me know that she was doing well . We will now be switching both our dogs to this facility. I highly recommend ECLAP.</Review>

WOW!!!!!!!  My wife and I have been to many vets over the years.  Yesterday, we took our 2 Dachshunds to ECLAP for the first time.  And I can tell you without a doubt, we have just found our Forever Vet!  Dr. Bear and Irene, Wow, Wow, Wow!  So caring, understanding and professional!  Employees that are passionate about what they do and genuinely listen to your thoughts and concerns you may have about your pets.  I can't even tell you how impressed we both are. :)  My wife and I left talking about how well we were taken care of and treated all the way home!  Just a great first time experience! We can't wait to return and have the satisfaction of knowing our little pups will be taken care of by the staff at ECLAP!  Thank you thank you!< /review>

I was able to get our dog seen within two and a half hours of my phone call. I was treated with respect and my baby(dog) was not hesitant at all to go with one of the techs that came to get her from the car. They were so sweet and nice with my baby. They kept me informed of everything as they were doing it. The Vet came out to speak with me twice to let me know that my baby was doing great and to talk with me about a treatment plan and then when she was all done to talk about the plan at home. WOW!!! I feel like I hit the jackpot, This clinic is fantastic. The office staff worked so hard to do everything for my baby and they genuinely cared about her. This was my first visit here and I know they will be there if I need them again!!!< /text>

<Text>Best Vet ever.  I have been to too many vets and been over charged for services they scare you into because if you don't , you feel like a bad dog owner.  ECLAP is amazing.  They are conservative with what they suggest and they do an amazing job.

Dr. Manring and the entire team at ECLAP have never let me down. Anytime I need an appointment, whether it is an emergency or a routine visit they are always available for me. Dr. Manring’s professionalism, knowledge and empathy that she expresses to her clients is second to none. She showed my family, myself, and my beloved horse Tanner so much love and dignity in his final hours. She also never hesitates to answer any of my million ridiculous questions or concerns about my little herd. Thank you Dr. Manring and everyone at ECLAP for all that you do for us!< /Review>

We recently changed vets after adopting a new puppy and not feeling very satisfied with her puppy exam at our previous vet.  We very pleased with Dr. Christel and staff at ECLAP.  It was a completely different  experience compared to our previous vet.  Even with the restrictions in place due to COVID 19, we felt we received very personal and thorough service and our dogs were their priority while working with them.  I would highly recommend them!</text>

They got my goat in last second. Was very honest, got it done quick, and reasonably priced!  Considering driving the hour from my house from now on to being all my animals here!<//review>

Our little Schnauzer Annie, needed medical attention on a Saturday morning.  We adopted her last October, so we had not taken her to a veterinarian yet.  Caitlin met me at their office, even though she had an emergency call that morning.
She was wonderful with our Annie, kind and caring, and was so thorough with her.  She explained everything to me, and I decided then that she would be Annie’s new designated vet!!   And thankfully, Annie is going to be just fine! ♥️< /text>

<Review>East County Large Animal Practice is the best Veterinarian care in the Southwest.

Dr. Harlan was fantastic! He ran late, but called before the appointment time with an updated time. Once here, he took all the time we needed to answer all of my questions. He was even proactive and answered some questions that I could come up because I am a new goat owner. His demeanor with the animals was calm and gentle. It was clear that he likes animals. He was also kind to my small kids. We are so incredibly happy to have found him!<//text>

< Review>
ECLAP is the best medical service we have used for our horses  The entire team is very professional and efficient. But, the most important element they bring to the table is their kindness and compassion.  We have had a horse that is challenging to work with who also has serious arthritis and bouts of cellulitis. Throughout the journey they have been a guiding light of care.< /Review>

Dr. Harlan provides compassionate care to my older horse & pony, as well as my three donkeys.  He is professional, caring and communicates well.  The level of care that Dr. Harlan provides is excellent, so is the ease of making appointments and follow-up calls with the staff at E.C.L.A.P.
I trust Dr. Harlan and am confident that he wants the very best for my equine family.<//Text>

***Update*** I have changed my review to 5 stars. What a difference in experience from the last vet. Our last vet has had months and months of "fill in" vets after a health crisis. We have not had a very good experience there since. They also made clerical changes which was the straw that broke the camel's back. After talking with Dr. Crystal today, I feel so much better about my dog's care.
It's too soon to say yet as I don't know if they will be better than my previous vet. I have not heard back from them about all the tests they performed. I did call and leave a message for the vet that I saw and did not receive a call back. I do like the setup and the people there are incredibly nice. I didn't feel rushed and they seemed thorough. Slightly more expensive than my previous vet. I hope the higher price equals better care.</Text>

I was referred to ECLAP when I first moved to East County in April '19. I'm so glad I was, I have nothing but amazing things to say about the entire team. Super nice & great customer service. I never feel as if they try to upsell me or overcharge me. They truly want to help you and your furry loved one. I'm so glad I have such an amazing vet for my fur kids!<//text>

Dr. Bear and all of the staff at East County Large and Small Animal Practice were wonderful! The vet tech even held and loved on Cutter while she was up on the table being examined so she would feel comfortable. They got back to me right away with lab results which was really nice, as waiting on results can be very nerve-racking. I am so happy to have found Dr. Bear and his team and look forward to visiting them with Cutter for many years to come. Thank you!<//Text>

My parents have used this practice for years for their horses, we had a bad accident with our lab and he needed amputation but we didn’t have a regular vet so I gave ECLAP a call. Their prices are great, as well as every staff member we encountered.  Seriously the best vet we’ve ever been too. Thanks to Dr Bear, Ashley and the vet assistant who helped with surgery, for taking great care of our boy Ranger.<//text>

Loved our experience at ECCLAP. Got right in to see a vet after requesting an appointment.  Dr.Bear was very helpful and made us feel very taken care of. Prices were VERY reasonable.  Checked out after an exam and medication and paid less than I did at my usual vet for just an exam. We will definitely be back!<//Review>

I brought my 15+ yr old kitty with kidney disease in for bloodwork, it was done within 20 minutes and Dr Bear came out to review the findings with me and was so compassionate. The kind staff (including Ashley) even took the time to fix the covid haircut that I had given my kitty since her groomer is closed (they are much better at this than I am !)< /text>

wonderful as usual.  My granddog had started shaking her head on of course a Friday afternoon.  I called they  fit us in so she could get the treatment she needed quickly.   Love this place.  We go to Dr Bear but I am certain all the vets are nice.  They go out of their way for the critters</text>

<Text>We moved further away from our long time vet three years ago. I finally made the decision this week when our dog needed care to switch to ECLAP because they are so much closer in proximity to our house, and they came so highly recommended. Dr Oman was wonderful! We officially have a new vet. Super happy with the care our Nala received.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80d95f61e1666133:0x2c331ec580442730< /Gmap_id></record>

Dr, Christel was marvelous and I know that going ahead my kitty, Arrow, will be receiving the best of care. I was unaware that Arrow was in stage 2 kidney disease but Dr. Christel showed me the results of the blood work she did and we discussed what can be done to at least slow down the progression. He is also hyper-thyroid and I feel comfortable knowing he will be able to get his meds on a regular basis. I came to ECLSAP because the vet I was going to in Alpine (Alpine Veterinary Hospital) retired and I discovered it had been bought by the other vet in Alpine (County Veterinarian) where I had a horrid experience several years earlier. This Practice is only one freeway exit further down for me so still convenient enough. I love the country setting here and my kitty was treated gently and kindly by the rest of the staff. I'm so glad I found this Practice and highly recommend it.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>This was my first experience in dealing with ECLAP. I recently adopted 2 goats/kids, I’ve only owned chickens, rabbit, dogs and cats . My 5 month old goat Wyatt- was struggling to urinate for a few days, I worried about stones.
After doing what most people do, I began reading everything I could on the internet, farmers home remedies and such. I was more afraid to cause my boy any harm. So I made the call.
My call was answered by Dr. Harlan, I explained his symptoms. And Dr. Harlan patiently listened and was so amazing because he took the time to explain all possibilities, options if it was indeed a blockage and his own past experiences. Even though they were booked, Dr. Harlan suggested I bring Wyatt in (They do home visits too) and he would see him between patients.
After a couple of hours, Dr. Harlan called me and    again took the time explained his findings, and allowed me to ask questions without making me feel rushed. We had a plan. He was honest, empathetic, and never recommended additional procedures or gave hidden false hope.  He gave me an estimated cost, which I was so fearful off( I need both kidneys- but would have sold one if needed) the price was doable.
Wyatt came home the same day in the evening and has been doing amazing. He’s on medications and I learned so much on proper feeding and care.
I will continue to use this amazing vet.  From Dr. Harlan (One of a team), the techs I spoke with  and the friendly staff at in the office. This is by far a 5-Star experience.

Thank you ECLAP/ Thank you Dr. Harlan and team from Wyatt and myself.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

In an unfamiliar time of isolation, I was warmly greeted in my somewhat emotional state over concern for my "pup", a very large doberman.  I felt "heard". Care was taken to address all of my questions.  Thank  you ECLAP staff.<//Text>

<rating>3<//rating><Text>I thought the two receptionists in the front office were unwelcoming for our first visit.  We were the only ones in the office and they couldn't pry their eyes off their computers to acknowledge me.  Even when one of them was asking me questions, it was while she was facing the computer.  I could not get my daughter's wheelchair through the door and, of course, they were oblivious to my plight.  I left my daughter outside of the office.  The receptionist then took us to a room and tried to weigh both my dogs.  She did not even try to talk to either of them.  The vet saw each dog for 10 min each, which is fine for a well check up.  She did not review the past records sent from our previous vet in front of me.  I'm giving  3 stars to be nice.  My previous vet always had a busy office and were still welcoming and nice.  This was actually my second visit.  I walked in one day to check out the office since I just moved to Blossom Valley.  It was empty again and I was greeted with a look of "why are you here."  I should have known then not to come back.  I think this office needs to sell itself a little better.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<text>My horse had been a client/ patient for the past 4 1/2 years. All past check ups have been "ranch visits" where he is boarded. This time I trailered him to you. Everything went very smoothly. Dr. Johnson explained everything during the exam, including a concern which will be monitored over the next few months. She explained treatment options thoroughly including photos and diagrams of the affected area.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

This place is amazing! Seriously. I brought my litter of mini goldendoodles here for an exam and first shots.
To start, everyone that works here is SUPER friendly! The exam itself was above and beyond what other vets do for first exams with puppies.
At checkout they accept Apple Pay which is so convenient!
I live in Ocean Beach which is about a 45 minute drive from this vet but they will now be my primary vet! Going here is like a little mini vacay. It’s so spacious and on my visit they had some adorable alpacas!

Bottom line.. do yourself a favour and go here!<//review>

Great staff. Very friendly. Soft demeanors. They really care about the well being if your animal and know what's best for them. I had shopped around for a dental cleaning and extractions for my small dog and it was hundreds of dollars less than most places in East County! Wonderful experience.< /text>

I can’t say enough wonderful things about the whole team at ECLAP. They took care of our dog like she was a princess and they truly care. Brandi is so helpful and sweet and  Dr Dan is outstanding with all my animals. But the surgery he did on our last dog was a tough one but he took it on and did a perfect job. Thanks to him we  will have many more years with her. We will be Forever thankful for his kindness.

Dr Johnson is the greatest vet ever! She treats my horses with gentleness and respect!  She was there when I had to say goodbye to my oldest horse, and I trust her with my others. So thankful she’s part of the ECLAP team! Always has sound advise too!< /review>

The appointment was very quick and they broke the news to us in an extremely gentle way. The Dr was very sweet and I felt like she took care of my dog as she would her own.
I would like to think I'm a pretty tough woman but when we got the news that we only have a few short months left with my dog, I cried like a baby and the Dr comforted me like she was a long time friend. She gave me a huge and let me cry on her shoulder as long as I needed. She chatted with us about different treatment options and was very honest with us. This Dr made all the difference in the world. Thank you so much for your care and kind heart. It is more appreciated than you know.

Also, this vet came highly recommend by another vet and even though I live nearly an hour away, I will always take my animals here because the care was amazing. This is more than a vet, they treated us like family .</Text>< Pics>

Being a new vet for me we talked about how I liked my horses interacted with.  Dr Manring was spot on!  And my normally suspicious older mare was comfortable with her.  Dentals went easy and no one was sore in their mouth.  And Jake’s lip is a thing of beauty!  5 stitches, no separation after 3 days, dry and you have to look close to see he had a dime sized lump removed!  I’m so pleased.  I definitely would recommend Dr Manring!<//text>< Rate>

Dr Catlin Manring is an excellent vet. I was impressed with her knowledge regarding horses and pleasent demeanor. Her obvious love of horses shined through as she worked on my senior horse, talking to him, even though he was being a rather difficult paitent during a float.  She will be my first choice Vet for future care for him. I highly recommend her.</Text>

My dog needed an injection for her allergies. All well and good, but the extra service and willingness to answer questions about food choices and how to keep my middle aged dog healthy and joints mobile, were very much appreciated. The information was thorough and made it easy to make a plan for my dog. I was very pleased.<//review>

I took my white labrador in for a neutering operation  and was extremely pleased with the customer service and the care they gave.  Definitely going to make this my vet clinic from here on out.  Very affordable as well.  We've tried a few others in the past but felt like they were just trying to upsell us on medications and services.  Highly recommend ECLAP!<//review>

<review>We’ve been taking our 6 year old Doberman for veterinarian care since she was a puppy. We love everything about East County Large  and Small Animal Practice!  Although everyone is highly professional and well trained, they are all approachable, friendly, kind and clearly animal lovers.

Last week we  thought Willow had been gouged by her brother while playing at the beach. Over the weekend we noticed the wound had worsened and looked more like a bad spider bite. I called Monday morning at 8am and the receptionist said she’d get back to me to see if she could make some changes to fit us in.  It took an hour or so but she called back and got us in to see Dr Omen, who was great!

There have been some new members to the staff as one of the former owners retired recently.  Knowing this, I was a bit worried about getting in to see a vet quickly and even about getting a call back within a day.  Apparently things are running smoothly now as all was done beyond my expectation.

Gratefully, the prices for their services are completely reasonable.  For our appointment Monday, the ointment, antiseptic gauze, antibiotics,  and DrOmen’s and his assistant’s services were all inclusive in the cost.

I recommend East County Large and Small Animal Practice wholeheartedly!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80d95f61e1666133:0x2c331ec580442730<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Ryan and the staff were wonderful to Sammy and loved the way we both were treated. Sammy, my dachshund has had skin and allergy issues all of his life ( rescue 🐶) and its been and will be a life long issue for him. Having a vet who listens and cares it important to me and essential to Sammy's well being.
I believe we're off to a great start! Very efficient service and beautiful surroundings love the openness of the facility. Thank you!< /review>

<text>Dr. Chandler got my senior pony safely through a scary choking incident.  I really appreciate his fast response after hours, calm and professional care of my stressed pony, and clear and patient after-care instructions for me. Thank you, Dr. Chandler!</text>< user_id>

<review>Doctor and staff were outstanding in their care of Maxine.  Their care met my highest expectations.  Glad the Army Veterinary office at Mirarmar recommended I go to you for the x-rays she needed.  Best of luck and continued success.

Excellent! Took great care of my Marley. This was a second opinion and they diagnosed and treated the issue with kindness and compassion. Dr Rebecca and assistant worked together as a team. I was 100% happy with the treatment provided. Thank you, HS</text>

Dr. Johnson was amazing! I have 3 girls (ages 13,11, and 6). Dr Johnson  took time to answer all our questions and educated us during her exam on our horses and during the dental procedure.
Thank you Dr Johnson!<//Text>

<Review>Dr. Harlan was great, this was my first "farm call" ever and he was very helpful and gave us all kinds of useful information, answered all my questions and was very thorough.  He even gave me the opportunity to see how to give my pig and injection behind the ear in case I would like to give it a try in the future.  Buddy, our 4H pig is doing much better today :)  Thanks Dr. Harlan you ROCK!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>The vet that came back was awesome! He was very gentle with my girl even though she wasn't cooperating. He was knowledgeable about her issue and took the time to discuss all the treatment option. Charlotte even got a hoof trim!

Years later and they are still the gold standard in veterinary care. Dr.Harlan came out to my house in the middle of the night to help us. Everyone we’ve come into contact with has just been great.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80d95f61e1666133:0x2c331ec580442730< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We love EVERYONE at ECLAP! We recommend  them EVERY chance we get, for small pets to large farm animals! They take such amazing care with our Family members! 🐾 It is getting much busier than iin years past. But, we're happy to have patience any time we go, since the busier it is, the more successful they are. 💞 Sorry I added too, much sugar to the cheesecakes! 😂</Review>

After a bad experience and an INCORRECT DIAGNOSIS on my black lab at VCA on Broadway, I took my lab to ECLAP and found out my dog does not have a heart problem but is anemic. Took both my labs and was very happy with their exam, the veterinarian and treatments. THANK YOU !  Staff is awesome, too!< /review>

The barn atmosphere helped my dog relax prior to his appointment.  We waited outside and it really helped a dog that panics when he goes to the vet.  The staff was courteous and very caring.<//Text>

<Text>The staff was great but I took my pet sheep in to get fixed and I had a difficult time getting basic care. Things like how old it was, what condition it was in, reminding to give shots. If I take the time to drive my critter down there the least I expect is a basic health check . Was only given after care instructions after I called them once home. Also no one has called to see how my animal was doing and if I had any questions<//Text><rate>3< /rate>< resp>

<review>My young goat was having difficulty breathing so I was there when they opened. The facility was very clean the staff was very nice. Dr. Johnson examined Heart and said I was doing everything that I should do for his upper respiratory infection. I thought I had overreacted in bringing him and we really didn't do any treatment. Heart passed away in the night. I wish we would have been Proactive and done more.  I spent $100 and really didn't get any result. I should have been more persistent in getting him some IV fluids and maybe different meds. Live and learn. This is my first time dealing with sick goats</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

< review>
Good Morning! This was a write up from our last visit! Want to reiterate how amazing Dr. Bear is! Below will be about our visit yesterday! Dr. Bear was absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!!! I brought my little black Pug in named Ernie and from the moment I arrived to the moment we left it was an absolutely wonderful experience. I called the previous day to make an appointment before hours and the gal on the phone wound up talking to me for like 15 minutes and before we hung up wished my little guy a speedy recovery and hoped that he would be feeling better soon. I hung up the phone and had to tell my husband just how nice even the receptionist was. Dr. Bear took his time with Ernie, did a very thorough exam, then gave me his diagnosis and recommendations. I felt as though he treated my baby as though Ernie was his own. No denying not only does Dr. Bear and staff love animals, but have a love for people. Top notch experience!
Yesterday our little guy Ernie, has his teeth cleaned, and Dr. Bear was again AMAZING and compassionate. He knew how much our little guy means to us! Called immediately after to let us know he was all done and doing well! We can’t say enough! Thank you Dr. Bear! ❤️🐾<//review>

<review>We loved working with ECLAP! Doctor Harlan was great with our very energetic two-year old mare and the office staff was amazing and easy to work with as well. We called 10 minutes before our appointment to change our plans and they were happy to accommodate. I would definitely trust them with any of my horses and would recommend them to anyone.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I have been twice to ECLAP clinic and tho it was an hour drive from my home in Escondido, it was well worth the trip.  The first visit was to have several of my dog's teeth pulled.   The last visit was to  have a doctor look her over and check a lump in her side that is slowly growing.  X-rays were taken and it was determined it was not encroaching on any vital organs, or hurting her in any way.  It  is not something that shows under her coat, and we are just going to watch it in the future.  I was very pleased with both the thorough exam and explanation given by the vet.  In getting estimates from two vets I found that ECLAP is much more reasonable.Thank you</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Needed to get both my golden retrievers a rabies booster. We were in and out within 10 minutes, and that was without having to make an appointment first (they had received an exam within the last 12 months). Very reasonable charge for the boosters, too. Thanks, ECLAP!< /review>< pictures>

I’m so glad I switched to this vet .. hands down I felt like the listened and heard my concerns.  I felt like my pets health was first.  I switched to this vet after several years of using another and feeling like they were never listening to me. Listening is key in life!!! These people heard And delivered above and beyond my expectations.   Thank you 😊< /review>

My dog Sproles is usually standoff-ish to new people, but was so good when I brought her here the first time.   I'm so thankful to have found you guys for my dog's treatment needs. I recommend everyone to come here.< /Review>< username>

I absolutely love ECLAP ! Everyone there is so kind, loving and down to earth. The girls in the office are always so funny and nice. Dr. Ryan Bear is the best, he’s so honest. I’ve been to other vets where you go in for a skin rash and walk out with a quote for over a thousand dollars. Not here at ECLAP! They always save me money. I’m just so grateful for them. ❤️</Text>

ECLAP personnel did a wonderful job with my small terrier-mix, Toby. Toby usually scared at the vet. He is a rescue dog and has obviously had bad experiences prior to our adopting him. The vet at ECLAP was gentle and understanding of Toby's "personality problems". They determined where and what his problem was and offered several options for treatment. Overall, a very good visit to the vet...even if Toby didn't think so. Thanks...Jim Brown</text>

They are all extremely knowledgeable and if they don't know something, they aren't afraid to ask their associate for an opinion or suggestion.  Dr. Smith is especially good with older horses and shows compassion for both them and their owners.   It has also been great having a small animal office available.  Kind of like "one stop shopping."   Love their yearly Christmas party!!!    Great way to show they appreciate loyalty.< /Text>< Pics>

I had an emergency with a horse I lease and the owner's vet was not available so I called ECLAP, the vet practice I use for the horse I own. Dr. Harlan was there in less than 45 minutes. He laid out a clear plan for the horse's care and offered reassurance that, although there was a ways to go yet, he felt the horse could get better. I had been afraid we would be putting him down that day but Dr. Harlan got us over the hump. I love ECLAP.< /Text>

< Review>
Going to a new Vet can always be stressful but everyone at ECLAP made us feel at home from the first phone call to check out.   Both my cats were at ease and comfortable with everyone.   My stubborn male cat, Flynn, even purred while there which he rarely does.  Loved the service and will be coming back as needed.  Thank you ECLAP</Review>

As a first time patient, it was nice that Dr Oman came to chat with us out in the reception area. That was a great personal touch. Although the outcome wasn't promising, he provided another option to try on our next visit.<//Text>

<text>I have a 39 year old Mustang that because of his age has problems with his teeth and arthritis. Both Dr's Smith and Chandler are always available by phone to answer any questions I have about his feed and changes I can do to improve his nutrition. They are gentle and kind to my old guy when they check his teeth and do not float them unless they really  need them. They use a lower dose of sedative because of his age which means they have to put up with some of his shenanigans. I have been with them for 30 years and highly recommend them. I am very comfortable leaving the care of my dear friend to them.</text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80d95f61e1666133:0x2c331ec580442730</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Exceptional!  Took our dog in for a dental procedure based on recommendation from a friend.  Our (former) vet was going to charge over $1000 and the team at ECLAP did it for under $400.
Dr. Bear did a great job with Duke and called me personally after he was done. He answered all my questions and was the most personable and approachable vet I have ever experienced.  I wish we weren't getting sent to Okinawa so Duke could keep going here.
Cannot recommend the entire team at ECLAP enough!</review>< name>

<userid>111025243250982424473</userid><Text>I did some research and found this place on google
I was pretty impressed with their reviews , so I made an appointment for my 3  1/2 month old Mini  pig for his nurturing ! At first I was pretty upset because I had dropped him off at 8 am and was told that I was going to get a call as soon as he was out of surgery, So it was around 1:30 and I hadn’t heard from them so I called and at first they told me that he was all done and then the receptionist put  me on hold and said that he did not have his surgery yet the doctor had a emergency,which I understand there are emergency , things come up! but there could have been just a little better communication on their part.   So then I was told to pick him up at 4:30 , I had about a 45 minute drive , I waited until 4 pm. still no call
so I started to wonder what was going on ,I drove up and he was just getting done , So I waited out on the patio and shortly after the doctor came up and gave me an update, then went to check on my pig
I really liked that the doctor took the time to come out and explain everything to me and had the time for any questions or concerns! At that point I was more relaxed!  He also made sure that before I left that he explained the recovery and healing process again and made sure that I didn’t have any more questions! So overall I give the facility a four stars but the doctor did an amazing job on my Pepper he definitely gets a five ⭐️ star rating !  I recommend Dr.Harlan ,he was absolutely professional,friendly and caring for my pig</Text>< date>

<Review>I had an issue with the meds I ordered through the online store - totally my mistake - and ECLAP immediately sent me what I should have ordered and told me to bring in the meds I had mistakenly ordered the next time I was in town, even though that wouldn't be for close to a month.  They did this without any charge other than the postage.  I've been using them for 10 years, and couldn't be happier.< /Review>< name>

They did great with my filly, couldn't recommend them enough. She went lame overnight from an abscess, they were out the next day, explained everything they were doing, and made sure I felt comfortable with what I was left to do. Eclap also saved my mustang from colic about a year ago, in my experience they always do great work.</Review>

I am very gapph with the responsiveness and attention bgiving to my mare when she was colicing.  Dr. Johnson made every attempt to ensure we knew exactly what was going on, very detailed for me in her notes of aftercare and follow up.  I highly appreciated the 24-hour call center as this has been a huge help for me.  I could not of been any happier.  Thank you Dr. Johnson, you made all the difference Sunday morning.< /text>

They are definitely there for the right reasons. Their cost was close to $500 less than what our current vet quoted us. We are 100% moving Sophie’s care to ECLAP!

< Review>
I would never recommend these people to anyone. I brought my ten-year-old cat in to get her teeth removed and ever since then she's acted like I beat her and she runs away and hides underneath the bed 24 hours a day I told these people to take extra care of my cat and ever since she's not the same cat anymore and she's traumatized by The Experience she's had with these people. Not only that but after the surgery her face swell up so badly that the next day she had pus coming out of her mouth and her whole face was just so swollen that I had to take her somewhere else to get her help. I don't even think they gave her a pain killer when they were doing the surgery , she will never be the same cat again. They didn't even give her an antibiotic shot after the surgery so I think they wanted her to get infected so I would bring her back to them to fix her. I would not trust these people with your cat.</Review>

Always a great experience with great people.
We lost our Oldest Rescue on the 2th of last month and then on the 30th our Smallest and Second Oldest Rescue had a major Seizure.
The wonderful people at ECLAP saw him quickly and after some checking, reassured us he was doing okay.
Can't say enough good things about them all.<//Review>

A+A+A+A+.....I cant say enough about the care that the Doctors and staff give to my family,animals. I really feel at home at ECLAP, They take care of my Pigs,Goats,Cattle,Sheep,Dogs,Cats.Dr Oman has gone over and above with the health care of our farm, The office staff takes such good care of all of us, human and fur babies too!!They are always so friendly, always has time to stop and chat ,even if they are right in the middle of something! I so appreciate all the knowledge they all have to take such good care of all of the farm!! And I have NEVER felt unfairly charged for the services we have received. I highly recommend ECLAP..</Review>

<text>We were looking for a new vet, read reviews on Descanso Neighbors and Nextdoor app regarding ECLAP, many positive reviews. We visited ECLAP with our 4 large dogs and could not have been more impressed. The Veterinarian's, Vet techs and office staff were accommodating,  warm and caring with our pups. We highly reccomend ECLAP</text>< pictures>

<Review>ECLAP has some of the best vets I have had.  When I call in with a question, either the office will ask a vet in  the office or you can leave a message.  They will return your call with the information you are looking for.  They are caring and knowledgeable and if one does not know the answer, they will use their resources to find out.  I would and do recommend ECLAP to anyone who is looking for a great vet.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<pictures>None<//pictures><review>Superlatives!  I couldn't make up my mind whether to have a ranch call or an office visit, and the office staff was extremely patient with me.  We no lo have large animals, but I didn't want to haul three cats and a dog into the local vet's office, even though it is just down the street. I would have to pay for four office visits, and to take the dog and the cats together to the ECLAP small animal office was not really not possible---so we paid for an old fashioned ranch call and Dr. Smith accommodated us like he always does.  Dr. Smith is a caring, down to earth guy and always takes the practical approach. We have been with ECLAP for about 25 years and we have never had any bad issues with them.  Highly supportive as well as understanding and ranch practical.</review>< Rating>

<Review>I have a 12 1/2 yr old dog who is my dearest friend.  He is a large pit mix and the sweetest animal.  He is my constant companion, he goes everywhere with me.  In the last 6 months he is really slowing down and gettting up and down have been hard on his back end.  He has had is right knee operated on and 3 cancer surgeries in his hind quarters which is why the drastic slowing down.  Dr. Oman has been helping me find solutions on how to make more comfortable.  We have tried a few different things and now just got done with a series of 8 laser treatments on him.  It is like having my old dog back.  He stopped following me around, now he is doing that again!  He wants to run and play when we are outside.  He can jump up on our bed again.  We know he is an older dog, but if you saw him, you would swear he was no older than 5 or 6.  Thank you Dr. Oman, thank you for giving my dog a less painless life.  Thank you for taking the time with me, the crazy dog owner.  Kathy who has done all the laser treatments is wonderful.  I have sent other dog owener in, and they all have nothing but good things to say.  My family has used them for years, now luckily we are too.

<time>1490359187911</time><rate>5< /rate><Text>I think the word "CARE" is the most appropriate when describing what ECLAP is all about. They care about the animals, they care about the owners, and the excellent care they provide is way beyond the normal. Communication is another aspect where they excel. The office staff is patient and works with us in so many ways. When I call on ECLAP I know I am providing the best medical care for animals. The medical staff explains in terms we can understand exactly what is happening and our choices. They provide us with information and explanations, they tolerate the over reactions, they have compassion for our worry or sadness, they supply humor when it helps, understanding when needed and support whenever required. I think we in San Diego are so fortunate to have the very best which is ECLAP.</Text>< pics>

I have been using ECLAP for 20 plus years for my beloved horses. When they expanded to small animals we began taking our dogs there. The Vets and office staff is unsurpassed. They take time to explain treatments and options on each visit. They never pressure you on decisions that must be made but if asked is always willing to give you their opinion. They do not hesitate to call in specialists when needed. I am on the board of the local horse show club, Tumbleweed Riding Club. ECLAP has been very generous and a big supporter of our group. ECLAP is a huge asset to the community and to each animal owner.< /Text>

My experience with ECLAP was the same as it always is.  Everyone is so nice, so accomodating and so wonderful with my dog.  I have lived in East County my entire life and have always had lots of pets.  I have been to at least 10 other practices in my lifetime and ECLAP beats them all for price, expertise and customer service.  I would never go anywhere else!< /Text>

We are so glad that we found out about Eclap! The staff were all very friendly, and Dr. Bear was great. We got in and out for our puppy appt in 30 mins, with all of our concerns addressed, and it didn't cost us a fortune as it would've elsewhere.< /review>

I have been with ECLAP since 1999 - they are fantastic. Response is quick and courteous. They care for my horses and dog almost as much as I do. They listen to what I have to say and work with me. They have helped me pull my horse KitKat through Laminitis  and were there to help me with the passing of my horse Magic and my dog Athena. They are the best vets I have found and would never change.
Thanks so much ECLAP!!</review>

After being a client for nearly 10 years, I just can't say enough good things about Dr. Smith and the staff at ECLAP. They're friendly, extremely knowledgable, provide excellent care and education, and don't charge an arm and a leg. Routine appointments at my home have always been convenient for me, which I really appreciate because we live in the boonies and logistics can be tricky. When my horses have needed emergency care, the response has always been prompt. From basic care to teeth floating to reproductive services to colic, ECLAP is ALWAYS MY FIRST CHOICE!<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Dr Ryan is the Bomb he Rocks I love this place.  I rescue and have 7 dogs of my own as well.  I have been going to a bigger practice and more and more feeling like they just do not care .  I heard about eclap and decided to give them a try.  I am ever glad I did.  These people are what vets should be.     I am not always an easy client to deal with but Dr Ryan took the time answered all my questions.  He is calm cool collected exactly what you want for you babies.
Dr Ryan Opps I think it is Dr Bear LOL will be seeing my animals from now on.  Lucky guy stuck with me now.
I had trust issues with my last vet office but not at this vet they will be honest and when you meet Dr Ryan you will see .  For me it only took 1 visit to realize  this was the vet for me.   I put off a dental for my dog for 2 years because my last vet I just did not trust that they cared about my dog.  At the vet I was going to seemed like my animals  were just  $100 bills with tails.  I don't care about the cost but I wanted the vet to actually care about my dog and that is what you get at ECLAP people that care.

Cathy the Vet tech who assists Dr Ryan is abslutly precious, she treats your pet as if it were her own.  There are no words to say how wonderful she is, but know this I appeciated how my dog was cared for by Dr Ryan and Cathy.    I cannot believe how lucky I am to have found them. In the middle of the dental one of the nice tech/receptions came and told me all was going well.  That meant so much to me to know my Dog was Ok and doing well.  They all knew how nervous I was and everyone of them did what they could to make me feel more relaxed.
As much as I would like to keep this place all to myself, if you are unhappy with your current vet you may want to try ECLAP.
warning there is no fancy exam rooms or fluff but your pet could care less, the care is beyond wonderful at ECLAP the fancy fluff  you get at other places means nothing if your beloved pet is just a number.
ECLAP Dr Bear Cathy and Staff Wonderfu people don't ever change
thanks ECLAP
will be making appointment for my other guys< /review>< resp>

Dr. Christel, was very professional, and handled our horses very well. She floated their teeth, and all are Doing very well. She answered all of our questions, and if she was unsure, she went and talked to other vets, which is a plus, in my books.
Thank you, Dr. Christel<//text>

Used this vet for 4 years for annual care. My horse dropped a significant amount of weight and had a different vet look at them his mouth had ramps and ulcers even with being floated annually by their "vet" for 400 a year. Avoid at all costs.<//text>
