<text>I love coming here to get my gel nails completed. I had these done yesterday and they lasted me all night long with no chipping! I informed Rose that my nails tend to chip really easily because of how rough I am on them and my line of work. She took extra steps to prime and prep the nail so chipping would not occur.  I'm not a fan of red, but Rose picked this red color out for me and it's gorgeous! I also had my nails done by Vera and she did a great job as well! If you need your nails done, I highly recommend coming here! I have gotten so many compliments on my nails.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzTgErkX4Al_WKgh1DsgI0T41cj5iKV_cU0uIp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsyNMS23HLu0XdDYOH852POgad4tc3qAE-nxMS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjSO3SQwT2oWPZHy6_t5q85_VhAIr4vw50y3Wp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMP7GrNsZYO3vc9CRRkVYhtpvNok3jFiOW2qfll=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPW8c44oxhtD2uQelz0bDE-VPheWlX_i7j8TPpY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkL1_Fh0M4PAbqVerQKdajCqy3bRttGUWGbX3j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXfjotoiJWAqjgJw7ilpgWuJc_LLBsPlmslb5s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5_zUbi2-kRZ9UamqrHqxvyT_R1uuJpnMKLslG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3ESJtmkAbsT2oxnE094HQVSReTvDCVbi0Aj2V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZREl3ZI2ZcYYbjZXUPNZ0Wpo-igNFZzjHahgU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

Won’t return. I came here in mid April 2021. She cut me twice when cutting my cuticles and made me bleed! I’ve never been cut in the nail salon before. On top of that the water for my pedicure was too cold.<//text>

<review>By far one of my favorite nail spot! It's a hidden gem hiding in this area which I admire. I called a few hours earlier to see if there was any spots available for the same day and made an appt at 5pm. Came in on time and got seated few minutes after. I got a shorter coffin/tapered square shape which is $40 plus holographic for an additional $25. Prices are reasonable and the ladies here put in their work!</review>< GmapID>

<Rating>4<//Rating><time>1533343553055< /time><Review>Went in for a French pedi. No  Appointment but the wait  minimal, less than 10 minutes.  I was a little put off when I entered, because the entry was tiny small and not as cleanly as I would have liked.  I contemplated going elsewhere, but the reviews I read before going were so good, I thought I'd give it a try.
Everyone from the receptionist to all of the manicurists were so incredibly nice and I was comforted to see that the mani pedi address were clean and hygienic.
Angie did my pedi and she was AMAZING.  She was so in tune to what I needed as her client. She asked me how I liked my water and adjusted the temperature as needed.  The entire pedicures was very enjoyable. I felt no picks or pokes as she sloughed away the dead skin from my feet and meticulously shaped each nail. Her foot/leg massage was the BEST. It was worth the cost just for the message alone.
French pedi came out perfect.  Angie was efficient with her time and mine. Needless to say, I will be back.

<review>Staff was friendly. They did a fantastic job on my gel. Will definitely go back. They prefer cash but they accept card.

About a week later my nails began to bubble up and chip.<//review><UserId.>101766871468595033279</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Tan, the owner, greeted me when I walked in and sat me down with Valerie. They were very involved in the design I was wanting and incredibly attentive. I always tend to talk too much with my technician, but neither she nor the owner seemed to mind. They made me feel very comfortable as they were all fun to talk with. Will definitely be making this my go-to spot. Valerie is fantastic!</review><response>{'time': 1579229074143, 'text': 'Hi Erica, it was a pleasure have you in today and we appreciate it much with your cheerful mood.

I enjoyed my Nail tech Kou. I'm going back only for her. The Salon is dark and drab. The prices? Wow! Be prepared. Fill, zero repairs the cost? $65 before tip. Yes tipping is proper edeicit. Don't get your nails or hair done if you can't tip.✌<//Text>

I was in Fresno from out of town for work & really needed a pedicure. I was a walk-in, but they were able to take me right away which was great. They have a huge selection of colors & super comfy, brand new massage chairs (the chair was great). The pedicure itself was not spectacular but more than adequate and the young lady was very sweet. Overall a good experience with Heavenly Nails & Spa.<//Text>

This place is GREAT... the customer service is Awesome and they are very friendly. My boyfriend and I walked in this evening
for our first pedicures together and they had no problem with fitting us right in. Both Kim and Vera helped us and they were friendly and attentive to our needs. And their massages are on point not just a rub. Thank you ladies we will definitely be back!! Would highly recommend this place.<//Review>

Continually amazed at the cleanliness of the shop. They bag their feet basins between each customer you can tell that they change instruments for each customer the bathroom is even most of the time 100% clean. Their employees are very friendly and knowledgeable and always willing to try and get two operators to do your services like if you do your hands and your toes they almost always accommodate you by giving you to do your hands and someone get your toes.

The atmosphere between the employees is a friendly atmosphere and you can tell that these girls really like working with each other.

A clean environment prompt courteous service, additionally good prices quality supplies. Good selection of gel polishes with matching polishes that are not gel.</review><Rating>5<//Rating><user>112835023763793130271< /user></record></dataset><record>

I have been here 3 times.  Two times for an acrylic fill and once for a dip set.  I had the workers Song& JESSICA for my fills and i had Angie for the dip.  They all did amazing.  Next i will be going for a pedicure.  They get super busy, make appointments!< /Review>

Without a doubt the best nail salon I have been to! I decided to check this place out based on all of the positive reviews and am SO glad I did. I went in today for a free form acrylic since I really don't like the way fake tips but wanted something to shape and strengthen my nails. Alyssa did a great job and I am so pleased with her work -- she took the time to listen to my needs and was very articulate with her work. The salon was clean and all of the staff was very friendly :) I am so excited to FINALLY find a nail place in Fresno after moving back over a year and a half ago. Can't wait to go back for a pedicure too -- this place will be my new spot and I will sing their praises to anyone in need of a nail place :D Thank you thank you thank you!</Text>

Been wanting to do my nails for the past few wks just couldn't decide where to go. Super glad I came to there. Rose did an awesome job. It funny because I don't ever keep up with my nails. Just maybe I will because I like the service and people there. Place is clean and friendly. You will definitely see me when my nails grows out.< /review>

<userid>103993103934862553171</userid><Rating>2<//Rating><review>The customer service here was okay... I would most definitely recommend to book an appointment.

I arrived as a walk-in and I had to wait about an hour and a half to get attended. Yet, this was not the issue.

I had two ladies, one who did my pedi and another who did my manicure. My issue is with the massage you are paying for that is part of the service. They spent no more than 5 minutes, put a dot of lotion, and barely massage. It was the weakest massage I have ever received! Plus, the young lady who did my manicure left the polish near my cuticles and the polish is now lifting and pealing off (mind you I went there a week ago).

I would recommend to go to Polish'D Nail Bar. There they charge $40 for a gel pedi that includes the basics + candle wax to remove dead skin. With Heavenly Nail Spa that is not included and it is $40.< /review>< user_name>

Revised from 5 to 2 stars.  After being a regular here for about 2 years, I’ve stopped going.  The girls do good work, and I really liked them.  However the owner began consistently overbooking, and 3 times in a row, I waited between 45 minutes to an hour and a half one time, even though I had appointments.  The last time I got there, and he said it would be a few minute wait.  I was upfront, and told him I wasn’t going to wait if it was a long wait. He said no, only 10 minutes.  Then just as before it turned out to be 45 minutes.  I had also brought my elderly mom , and after they finally took me, she still waited another 20 minutes!  That is not okay when you’ve booked appointments.  Won’t return.
Previous review:
Decided to go to Heavenly spontaneously one day when I was in the area, and saw they had good reviews.  I had an AMAZING experience, having Amy and Tia give me a gel mani/pedi.  They did a great job, and Tia gave me the best and longest leg and foot massage I’ve ever experienced!!  I will definitely return to Heavenly Nails.</text>

I used to love getting my manicures and pedicures at this salon. However, recently the owner seems to be focused on getting clients in and out as quickly as possible and thus the service and quality has been lacking. Today, a friend and I had appointments for 10:00 pedicures. From the beginning we were rushed. There wasn’t time for enjoying the foot soak, the massage chair, or even the foot/leg massage. I even had to ask for my heels to get scrubbed enough to remove the rough skin. From start to finish the whole pedicure was done in 20 minutes. Both of the manicurists were kind and did a sufficient job, but they made it clear from the beginning that the owner had told them to hurry due to a large party coming in. I won’t be back.<//Text>

<Date>1547335491551< /Date><Rate>1< /Rate><text>I have been going here for a few years and the service from the girls that work there could range anywhere from excellent to a downright waste of time and money. I consistently saw Amy who was amazing then Susie who was just as good. They both left. The last three times I have been there they have played television and movies with Mature content on the very large tv.  During an explicit sex scene on Sex and the City, I asked the girl doing my nails (Valerie) to change what was on the television because women have their children in the salon. She laughed and told me that the kids weren’t watching it anyways. When it ended, one of the other technicians (Rose) suggested watching Fifty Shades of Grey. I quickly explained that there are children in the salon and I would appreciate it if they chose something PG- which they did. One of the newer nail technicians loudly and continuously used foul language “F* this and F* that” and “noooo F*ing way”. Needles to say, I go to a salon for a peaceful, relaxing and professional experience and this salon has turned into anything but that. I certainly will never take my daughters back either. Unnecessary and unfortunate : / My recommendation: Find a salon that has a little more class and professionalism.<//text>< Pics>

Not worth my money. There was a cat just roaming back and forth in the place. The lady didn't wash her hands when she touched the cat and clients hands. It was the quickest pedicure ever with no real scrubbing. It was basic cut, 2 second scrubbing, polish and that was it. I wasted my money on this place. you couldn't even tell I got a pedi.</text>

< Review>
The only place in Fresno I will have my nails done. I've been searching for the past 2 years to find a descent nail salon and Heavenly is it! I walked in just by chance and was so happy to find a salon where the nail technician listened to my concerns and preferences. She had a very nice easy going personality and was very professional and thorough. The entire salon was clean and everyone was friendly.  I only wish I had showed up on the day a cat was present. I am an animal rights activist and seeing a cat while having my nails were being done would have made my week!  I read a previous Google reviewer by Pa Vang.  Vang  expressed anger and paranoia over a cat. Vang's assertions were absolutely ridiculous and shows that she hasn't even looked at the scientific evidence. Cats DO NOT carry germs that could be infectious to humans. I'm also an Ivy League graduate and have researched all forms of potential health risks with cats towards humans. And there are ZERO diseases  that can be transmitted by just holding a cat. Pa Vang is obviously giving an animal phobic opinion from her own unfounded and unscientific imagination. Furthermore, nail technicians handle alcohol several times daily making their hands more sterile then yours or mine.  Put it this way, an average person hugging their spouse and then shaking hands at a business meeting is more likely to transmit an infection than a nail technician picking up her cat. So yes, Heavenly, does excellent quality work, they have a friendly atmosphere, and they are animal friendly.  They have shown a kind hearted disposition to animals. I support businesses that show love to animals. Heavenly is the only nail salon that will receive my dollars. Other businesses should follow Heavenly's lead and show love to our companion animals.<//Review>

< Text>
The environment is nice & busy. Techs are nice. Quailty and Customer service not so good. In less than a week I had 5 nails break. 5! Im a SAHM that does not do heavy labor at the most loading the dishwasher. I went in for 3 repairs 2 days apart and when i asked them to replace the full set that i spent $45 on the best they could do was give $8 off of a $33 full set. I shouldve have to pay for a set that lasted me less than 2 days before the 1st nail broke. So disappointed. Will never return.

Update: a total of 7 now smh! An apology is not gonna give me a new set of nails.</Text>

I've been to shops where kids mani&pedi from start to finish were done in 15 minutes. It's hard to find a nail shop that actually put in effort and focus on the customer they are working on at the moment instead of rushing to get on to the next customer waiting. I am a manicurist myself and these are the people that I would love to work with and wouldn't hesitate to hire if I owned a shop. Very clean shop too.Thank you Martha, vera and anna.<//Review>< Pics>

I went there with my grandma the other day and the employee was very helpful . My grandma is 84 and it’s really sad to see her frustrated trying to order. The worker Ariana was super helpful and patient. She not only allowed us to take our time but she also recommended the flavor of the month, which we ended up purchasing. I’m really glad employees like her exist. Everyone should come here. Had a very nice experience.<//review>

I went in yesterday on my break from work, and although it was busy, the customer service was amazing! two young ladies named Shadia and Ariana were very helpful and patient with the long line of customers. This had probably been my second time at a baskin-robbins, Ariana recommended me her favorite flavors and most popular items! 100% I’d come back here, I felt more than welcomed by these two ladies!< /text>

They should change the closing hours to 9:30 PM. Got there at 9:38 and the staff signaled from inside that they were closed. 2 more people couple minutes after tried later to come in with same results. They lost 3 clients in the last 22 minutes while they were cleaning which should be done after shift hours.</Text>

These 2 individuals should be praised as they are working very well and doing a great job of representing Baskin Robins and Togos , thank you Angel and Marry.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Don’t bother asking for the non-dairy cookie dough ice cream at this location. It is never available and the staff couldn’t answer whether they would have it at all. One of the staff members didn’t even know they carried non-dairy.<//Review>

The workers are friendly I give them 5 stars. Went to get ice cream. There's a Togos also connected. The workers work both companies. I don't think that handling ice cream and sandwiches, sandwiches and ice cream is good , it's cross contamination. The eating area should be clean and wipe down often. It's a nice place, but the owners or managers should keep the place clean. Don't get me wrong I will visit again.

I went back for Ice cream at Baskin-Robbins,  and  Togos on March 4, 2020. Still great customer service, very Friendly and polite. Also very clean , a big improvement from the last time. Management stepped it up in having the restaurant clean. Keep it up! 👏</text>< pics>

<Text>Did not enjoy this location at all. Maybe it was the location but I felt crowded, and that just made me not enjoy my ice cream. Plus it was very hot outside and I do not believe the A.C. was on. I love baskin robbins but my experience wasn't pleasant .<//Text><response>None< /response>< pictures>

Cashier was rude. I wanted a classic banana split and assumed she would look at the picture on the wall or ask . She made me an ugly ass banana split that looked like $#!t. Said something sass under her breath just because I didn't get she had no concept of how to make a banana split. Weird<//Review>

You know I love Papa Murphy’s pizza I always have the only one above them to me is round table but this specific Papa Murphy’s in Suisun, city California, is totally and completely disappointing.

First and foremost when you walk in the workers are very annoyed that you’re even there no hello how are you welcome to Papa Murphy’s what’s your order terrible secondly I called in and I placed an order for a half cheese pizza half chicken garlic gourmet minus the chicken because I’m trying to be a vegetarian and just go ahead and add a little bit extra tomato in substitution for the chicken that y’all will be removing and below are the videos of the result of pizza that I picked up this is the second time that this piss poor customer service has occurred and I’m just baffled as to how somebody when there’s a clear circle in front of you can’t graph what is half I have 2/4 cheese pizza and 1/4 garlic chicken vegetables minus the chicken I will never in my life ever come back here matter fact I will never go back to another Papa Murphy’s ever again it’s just round table.</text>

<text>The best 🍕 ever. Fresh🎉 made by some of the nicest people. They'll make it the way you want it. They assemble it just like it was for them. I baked it. FRESH 🎉 AND it did cost $30+ dollars! Yeah $16. Family thin, combo. pep, salami, sausage, olives, mush and onion. Not to mention sauce and cheese. Love this place. Been coming here for 5+ plus years, never disappointed. Alway great staff. Is there anybody else really.<//text>< gmapID>

Pizza is priced well. Prepared quickly. The employees are nice and courteous. Online ordering is easy and quick, usually allows for coupons that aren't accessible in-store.<//text>

A great way to have pizza.  Have fun at home adding more ingredients or just pop it in the oven.  Always seem to be cupons out there. Military discount also.< /Text>

<Review>Really authentic El Salvadoran cuisine, you absolutely want to have pupusas here. Whether you choose the zucchini pupusas or the pork & cheese or bean & cheese (or all of them!) they're made fresh to order and served with a side of cabbage salad. The price can't be beat. And the retro look of the restaurant is just awesome -- so much to see and experience while dining here!< /Review></record>

<Text>Decent pupusa and salsa. I was not a big fan of their tamales though.

Update: their Sopa de papa ( Salvadoran version of menudo) was super good- must try if you are into tripe soup!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

CASH ONLY!   Anytime we're in the area (San Bruno Ave) this is a must stop for some pupusas.  The only other thing I've tried on the menu is especial (fried) chicken wings which are decent. Pupusas are the family fave (chicken and cheese).  Super reasonable prices too.</review>

This place is great!  Where in SF can you get a light meal for $3.00 plus tax and tip?  No where.  Comes with cabbage and the pupusa had cheese and pork mixed inside !  Was very good. Also came with salsa and chips.  (One pupusa and cabbage, +chips)
A real find!</Review>

<Text>Went there for the first time the servers are moody. I ordered take out. Then they were charging me 2x what my  order was. The server was insisting that is what I ordered so I asked for the menu again. My bill was supposedley $16.00 not $24.00. So as it turned out she was giving someone elses' check. I got home excited to eat my yuca con chicharon fritas. 4 small pieces of chicharones and 4 pieces of yuca. My 2 pupsas are ok. But what killed me was the vegetable cortido no tastes and half way my food found 2 curly hair I hate to imagine where they came from. Sums it to say not going there anymore. 😒😒😒😒< /Text>< Time>

<text>The place hot and no fans.
The server doesn't understand English, and he messed up our order.
My sister ordered two tamales, and the server decided he only wanted to give her one even though the menu said two per order.
I ordered a banana shake, and he decided to add berries to my banana shake. If you are in customer service, please be able to speak English as well, especially in a restaurant setting.</text><Rate>1< /Rate>< Pictures>

Love their breakfast plate, which comes with scramble eggs (you should ask for Salvadoran style which comes with veggies) refried beans, fried plantains and hand made tortillas, and you can get it at any time day or night. I also like their fried corn tamale. Their pupusas are ok and I usually order cheese with zucchini. I come here from time to time cause they close until 11pm which is rear for a Salvadoran restaurant to close that late. The place is at times way too loud cause their music takes over the whole place and to have a conversation you need to be louder than usual. Also the place is not as dirty but their bathroom I will use only for emergencies. The area is parking meter only, but since I usually go in the night is free.< /Text>

I've been here four times.. all three times its been delicious! This last time.. I did not have the best experience.. the salsa was watery, we attempted to making it better and added lots of salt.  (That did NOT WORK!).. My pregnat sister's torta de asada was full of fatty meat, (gordo). The service is great, but your salsa im going to have to give it a thumbs down!< /Text>

Have eaten a couple of times since opening, and has improved with each visit! Food is consistently authentic tasting (except beans).. but is
spicy as anyone who loves hot peppers would like! Huarache is BOMB!< /review>

< Review>
We stumbled upon this place accidentally while visiting town for a soccer game.  The first thing that struck me was how clean it was.  We ordered a carne asada taco plate and a burrito--each were terrific.  The salsa bar is among the best I've had in a long time.  I highly recommend this place and will definitely come back next time we're in town.</Review>

Very good food. At first I thought $9.99 for a wet burrito was high but when it came I found out why. It was a good portion size as well as very tasty.  The lady at the register was very nice as well.< /Review>

<username>Sarai Mendoza</username><text>It was good, not so expensive. They did take a bit to get the orders out because there was a lot of people and we had a large group. Other than that it was good. The salsas are very good. Took my leftover salsa  home. The Jamaica water is made from scratch. Would recomend this place<//text>< Rating>

The Al Pastor tacos are amazing! You can't miss the avocado salsa either. They have a good selection of Jarritos and everything in the menu I have tried has been delicious. You will not be disappointed.< /text>

My husband and I stopped here for a treat Sunday evening. There were only two vehicles in front of us, and the line moved pretty quickly. When we got to the window and paid for our food, the worker came back to the window to tell us that he was sorry for the delay, but that he had to go to the back and dig out the ice-cream. We got our order after a brief wait. The worker was very polite and professional. Being short-handed was no reflection on the worker. That was management's doing.< /Text>

Went there around 2pm on a Saturday. Place was not busy.  Service was good but some of the food didn't taste fresh. (hamburger patty, bacon, fries) They may have been sitting around for a bit. Would give them a try again but I live too far away.< /text>

Really wouldn't recommend. Bad service and long wait. Went thru the Drive thru and had three cars behind me get their food before I even got my food because they had me pull forward. Like always. They were not busy no car ahead of me but they still had me wait for cold food.<//text>

I came to this location about a week ago and I tried that new beyond meat burger. And my first impressions of it was it smelled weird and tasted funny. Will not be ordering that again. Other than that the location was convenient and clean.<//Text>

It's a fast food restaurant.  If you're looking for a gourmet burger you've come to the wrong place.  If you're looking for a fast food burger it's one of the better ones.  You get it.</text>

It is a nice Carl's Jr. Restaurant and it can make good fun memories for both family and friends and can really be a fun place to eat together after a long day or to fill anyone's empty hungry belly. I have personally been here with good friends and it was really fun and great and satisfying!</review>

They have good service. Employees that smile. Their Famous Star has lettice, tomatoe, onion, and pickle. Vegetables are so important. They serve Barques Root Beer, not just any root beer.<//text>

<Text>Food was good, but overpriced, staff was slow, and restaurant was scorching hot. We asked three different employees to turn on the AC, but all said it was already on..... The vents were literally blowing hot air.  The ketchup was out, one of two soda machines would not work, and there is no such thing as a value menu.... Drinks are a ridiculous $3 and there isn't a side on the menu less than $2.49</Text>< Pictures>

If you go the desert a you become very familiar with the stop in banning.   My best experience was at Applebee's.   This place is consistent be feels expensive for fast food.  Bathrooms not passable but could be a lot better.  Bathrooms are always the test about a restaurant's quality.  Next time I will try Denny's or go back to Applebee's.<//text>

Food was cold. Barley any bbq sauce on my Western Bacon Cheese Burger. Cost me $24 for 2 meals. I could have gone to sizzler for that price and have hot food. Won't be going back.< /Review>

<text>Usually Carl's Jr. Is great. The food was excellent. The problem is the soda machine. It dispenses mostly water with a hint of syrup. I tried several selections and they were all mostly carbonated water. This Banning store is an outlier as I have never experienced this at any other Carl's Jr.  Thought you would want to know.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80db43e6ae666b45:0xb9b15009ecb91421<//Gmap_id>< user_name>

Pros: Staff were helpful and friendly.
Food is good. I ordered a chicken club sandwich and it was much better than other fast food restaurants. The chicken was cooked well and the toasted bun.

Con: The washroom was not maintained well and the overall place was not very clean.< /text>

Made my burger wrong (asked for a few items to not be on it).
I went up to the register to ask for the burger I ordered and I was polite about it.
They fixed my order, but when it was brought to our table I got a very negative tone with "Do you want me to unwrap it and show you Sir?"<//Review>< pics>

I do not know why we frequent this Carl's Jr.  The staff is not very courteous.

From now on we'll stop at Ramsey Burger across the street, even if we have to wait for a place to sit.</review>

<Text>Bad customer service. The what looked like the manager didn't even ask us if we wanted sauce with our food. Had to go back and ask for some. She didn't seem friendly enough.< /Text>< date>

The worst cheese burger i ever had from Carl's it must have been sitting on the hot tray for a long time . and then put in a press to flatten it out . Carl's should take the pictures down from the menu and put what the food realy looks like, false advertising for sure.<//review>

They gave her shots I did not ask for (and charged me) and basically forced their opinion of what I should get for my dog evens though I was very clear about what I needed. They seemed easy and convenient but I do not suggest this place to any dog owner. Terrible service, I am truly disappointed.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Canceled their clinic 4 minutes before the pet store opened today. What is the point of posting clinic dates and hours if you are going to cancel when people plan accordingly. My kitten is getting spayed next week and the rabies vaccine they offer there is the live vax- which I refuse to give her, and she needs to have proof of rabies vaccine at the time of surgery or they would have to provide her with that vaccine. I did my research and was so glad to find that this VIP pet care clinic offers the pure rabies vaccine- as many vets and other clinics do not. Thank you vip pet care for making me scramble around trying to find another place to safely vaccinate my kitten last minute due to your unprofessionalism and irresponsibility.<//review>< rate>

I went into Pet Supplies Plus on Mopac in Austin, TX to get my little 3.5 lb, 14 year old blind Chihuahua's nails trimmed.  The store brought in VIP Petcare Community Veterinary Clinic that day and they are atrocious.  A vet tech was holding my dog and the Veterinarian was trimming her nails.  Everything was going fine there were literally no issues and then another employee from VIP Petcare Community Veterinary Clinic who was checking people out when they were done must have been bored so he came over to where the Veterinarian was working and told me not to touch my dog….?  My dog is very old and blind and I was simply touching her head and letting her smell my hand so that she would know I was there – she can’t see because she is blind and was scared.  I thought it was inappropriate for this person to interject himself when everything was going just fine and no one had any issues until he showed up.  That conversation got heated because here is someone that is not involved with what was going on telling me to not touch my dog because it’s against their policy and then he actually said “I am not going to get fired because you are violating policy.”  The Veterinarian and the vet tech holding my dog never complained about anything and never said a word before or during this entire interruption.  Immediately after that a girl that had to be in her teens that works for VIP Petcare Community Veterinary Clinic came over and said she is refusing service and told me I had to leave the store – the Veterinarian stood their looking at her completely perplexed as to what was happening.  How this little girl decided this is beyond me but that isn’t her store (she doesn’t even work there) and they had no right to talk to me that way.  I called the store manager after I got home and he had no idea what was going on in his own store and said that they are a franchise and don’t have any say in whether VIP Petcare Community Veterinary Clinic is allowed to work in their store because that comes from corporate.  My takeaway is that if there is an outside company in your business and they are causing you to lose customers because of the ego of VIP Petcare Community Veterinary Clinic employees then you better figure out what you are going to do because this was an epic fail for VIP Petcare Community Veterinary Clinic and Pet Supplies Plus.  Someone that is not employed at that store told me to leave the store because I was touching my little dogs head!?!  Veterinarians are supposed to be there for our animals and this company does not put the animals first in care or comfort when they are treating our loved ones.  Do not do business with VIP Petcare Community Veterinary Clinic they allow their employees carte blanche to treat their patients and owners disrespectfully and Pet Supplies Plus does nothing to manage what they are doing when they are onsite in their business.<//Text>

I took one of my cats in here because he and another outside cat got into a fight and he had some bite wounds on his right flank. They took my cat in right away (it was a Friday after 5:00pm) and checked him out. They shaved his fur, examined his wounds and gave him an injection for pain. They also sent home some antibiotics. What I especially liked was that they called my regular vet to let them know what had happened and my regular vet called me to check up on my cat. I thought that was pretty awesome.<//Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>The vet is a jerk. Does not have a very friendly aditude. Would never use again. Took my dog to the shot clinic to save a little money instead of using my regular vet. My family used the same shot clinic several times before with no problem. Took my 2 small dogs and one big dog. My mom waited in line with the two small dogs and I stood off to the side with my big dog. One store over in front of a empty building for lease. I know how some people feel about pit bulls so I was trying to stand out of the way. When I first got there she did bark a couple of times then settled down. Not more then any other dog there. My dog is completely friendly and she is in a house with a Pomeranian and min poodle. The vet come over and told me to move my dog that she was upsetting the other dogs and he did not want her there. At this point she way laying down completely fine.I felt like I was out the way not bothering anyone. I got my money back and left. Waist of a hour. A vet should be impartial.< /text>< pics>

Horribly over priced. I went to another clinic and my dog received a DAPPL, bordatella, and rabies vaccination for $45. They charged me $80 at this clinic, and dropped the needles in a puddle and administered them to my dog before I could even say you need to get another needle. I hope he doesn't get an infection from this. They didn't even give me a real rabies certificate on paper. It was a flimsy receipt. I called them to get an actual rabies certificate so I could travel internationally with my dog if needed and the woman on the phone was arguing with me about it and didn't want to give it to me. I am extremely disappointed. The worst vet care and customer service I have ever experienced.<//Review>

< Review>
Absolutely awful. I wasn't pleased with the service- the store employees let the vet and their assistants know that we had been waiting two hours before everyone else and that we were first, and we had to wait while everyone else went ahead of us while an assistant launched into a sales pitch on why we should buy their dewormers/preventative stuff even after we continuously said no. The dog before ours pooped all over the table and floor and they didn't wipe up all the poop on the floor- there were still numerous spots everywhere. When our puppy was seen the vet administrated the vaccine within a second and jabbed it carelessly into her causing her to yelp and scream- which she never does with other vets. He also jabbed an oral dewormer into her mouth and sprayed it all over the table/her face and said 'oops.' He didn't even bother to wipe it before saying 'you're good.' I had to say 'it's all over her.' Before the assistant said 'I'll wipe you up to make you more pretty' meaning she KNEW the yellow dewormer was all over her face and coat. She didn't bother to use water and yellow stains were all over her until we took her home and bathed her. We paid for puppy pack 2, which included bortatella vaccine, and the vet said 'we won't give her that one, you can come back and do it later for free since you paid for it.' We let them know that we wouldn't be back as we are from out of town.... later we called to get a refund for the difference and the phone employee was extremely rude and said 'no, you won't get one because it was still cheaper to do puppy pack 2 instead of doing them individually without bortatella. You paid 67, and doing them individually would be 66.' Okay, so it's not cheaper, but fair since we paid only a dollar more for absolutely nothing. so asked if we'd get it free at our next visit. 'No, it won't be free. You'll have to pay for it.' She was rude and talked over me the entire time. I work customer service for medical and if I did that or behaved how she did, I'd lose my job! Overall horrible. You get what you pay for.</Review>

Nice Starbucks with 3 tables outside and some comfy seats inside. Usually not so busy and service is quick. Close to a lot of food spots and perfect to kill time before hitting fwys< /Review>

< review>
this place is great. Too bad their customers can't read the sign that says "no more than 10 people in the store." Seems like I'm the only person in the area who ever stands outside and wait for the human count to go down before i go in or even care to make sure. I'm sure if they could afford it they would have someone outside telling customers to wait, but this location is popular (for good reason) so they need all hands on deck to fulfill orders.

P.S. yes im too chicken to tell other customers the protocol. Luckily I know how to do mobile order and I'm usually in and out.</review>

<text>I keep coming to this specific location. Why? They are always friendly, personable, get your drinks spot-on (if they make a mistake they fix it ASAP),  know your name, ask about your day, nothing fake, and just a consistently good experience. They always know my drink e.g. "medicine ball" and how I like it. And I tried the Pumpkin Spice Brew today. A+. Didn't think I'd like it, but this was damn good!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

A nice place for meeting and they open at about 5am. So if you wanna write in silence then it’s best to go at that time while you grab your coffee and the street view from within at that time is really beautiful.

The staff is also friendly and polite. The place is always need and the bathrooms are always clean.< /text>

I reviewed this place a little over a year ago and at that time I thought it was about the best Starbucks that I visited. Well after coming today the place is still spotless the coffee is still great and the workers...they're still wonderful. They really do get it right.<//review>

The only Starbucks closer to Von's is the Starbucks INSIDE the Vons, but other than that, this Starbucks is pretty darn close! It's got everything. Hot coffees, cold coffees, spinach and feta wraps, try it European style with a flat white. You can even order online and in an actual line at Von's, right next door. Also it's extremely close to Crawford's.< /Text>

One of the busiest Starbucks in the area, there are always people here, can be hard to find seating. I usually order via the app and stay just a short time. Sometimes it can be hard to get staff attention to pick up order. Parking can also be difficult to find as many of the other businesses in the plaza are good and also busy.<//Text>

Nice store. Good vibes. Many entertainment industry people come and go here. Parking can be really easy or really difficult depending on the time of day because of Vons and BofA. It's my go-to Starbucks in the area. Easy freeway access too, right off the 134 East at Pass Ave.</Review>

<text>As I've said before I'm other reviews of Starbucks, it's Starbucks! If you've been to a Starbucks before, you know what you're getting yourself into (for the most part, they are working on that whole not arresting people thing... supposedly...). My drink was what I expected, the service was fine. It's coffee. I don't get my panties in a twist about it.</text>< Pics>

I was having one of the crappiest days until an awesome barista offered me an extra mini cup of the Caramel frappuccino I ordered. That little act of kindness made my whole day. Thank you. The frapps are always made consistently awesome here as well. This is my favorite location.<//review>

<Review>First rate service, along with the quality and value you would expect from a Starbucks. At this location, most of the staff are extremely knowledgeable, considerate, and polite. Not forgetting that the coffee is always great.</Review>< UserId.>

This is the worst ever Starbucks I've been too. I normally don't write review. But they over charged us for a free drink and not only took the stars from the app and charged our credit card. I'm glad the Starbucks solved for me after I called their help line. The store was useless to help us.< /Text>

The one and only.
It's all about location. And they pack it all in.
It's a hardware store not a supply house.
They have a superb selection of tools and drill bits blades etc..
If they can't get it for you you really don't need it.< /review>

Great little shop, was able to quickly run over on a break.  An employee was able to help me right away: she was very knowledgeable and helpful!  I'll definitely come back as it was so convenient.<//Review>

I was greeted as soon as I walked through the door and my needs were addressed in a way that wasn't overbearing either.

Always top notch service at this hardware store. The old gentlemen with the denim vest is legitimately priceless. It doesnt matter what ridiculous things I come in with he always knows what I need to fix it.</Text>

<text>Phenomenal service! I went to the store early in the morning to get some DIY equipment, screws, plugs and some wood. Upon my request for a specific length of wood, an extremely kind and lovely female store attendants (apologies I didn’t catch her name) kindly used a hand saw to cut the wood for me. What a fantastic level of service- highly recommend!<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Great little hardware store stuffed with supplies and a really helpful staff. I can always get help here. A bit more expensive than going to Home Depot, but it's so convenient if you are in the Financial District.< /Review>< gmap_id>

A small, yet surprisingly useful hardware store. Not the cheapest, not the biggest selection, but usually they have what you need. Even key cutting.<//Text>

Best Customer Service I have experienced in a while! I had been looking for a specific cart that I needed, forever, but turns out they were a seasonal item. I found they had one on the Ace website and I called in to this location on Tuesday and Maria said she could get it into their store by Friday morning. She even called me this morning to let me know they had it in stock. I went in, it was right there at the front desk, paid, and I was on my way :D</Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>This is a super convenient location!  I've come here to get keys made, pick up plastic bags, and more.  It's not just geared towards the offices that surround it (even though there is almost everything an office manager or facilities person may need).  They have gardening supplies, paint, drill bits, bulk screws, tupperware, light bulbs, and more!  I'll admit that sometimes getting keys made can take a little wait.  I had to wait about 20 minutes to get my key made since there was a pretty long queue, but I just browsed and took a mental note of everything there so I could direct others to their location if they needed something.  The staff is also very friendly and always willing to help out.<//text>< pics>

<Text>The visit started of great then turned out really horrible because of their service. I went in with the intention of getting key copies, looking for drill bits, looking at foam, and looking for other useful things. At first it was great with the clerks assisting me. Then turned into one of the following me around the store and also stating to the person who she was talking to on her personal cell phone (I have to watch this guy.”. After in which I tested by going to multiple isles and saw that she was following me. I am appalled and insulted that this person whom is suppose to be working is on her cell phone, rather then asking if I need help again, rather then assume I am going to steal something. I was very appalled and upset by this that my hands where trembling as I went to the counter to ask if they had key copies for the keys needed at the end. The fact of the matter is that lady shouldn’t treat her job with such disrespect by following customers assuming they are going to steal, just because it seems like she didn’t want to hang up her cell(non-work) phone and actually interact. As I left I also expressed that I was glad they didn’t have the keys, I don’t have to do business here, and will not becoming back.<//Text>< user>

<Text>I was surprised to find a legitimate hardware store in the middle of the financial district!  They had what I was looking for when I visited - a key making machine.  For larger hardware store needs I would still recommend venturing to a suburban hardware store because overall selection seems limited.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

This location lies to their customers about the restroom being out of order so they don't have to let customers use it. After realizing the restroom had supposedly been out of order every time I had visited this location for over a year, I asked one of the staff members about it, and she said it didn't flush. I just looked at other reviews and found a review from August of 2017 saying that the restroom had been out of order for a very long time. As we were eating, I saw a staff member go into the restroom, so I got up to wait outside the door. I heard her very clearly as she used the restroom, then I heard the toilet paper, then I heard the toilet flush without an issue, but strangely no sound of her washing her hands. As she opened the door, I reached for the handle since I could tell the restroom was functioning without an issue, and she forcefully pulled the door closed and said it was out of order then walked quickly to the back as I was in the middle of asking her a question so that there was nobody for me to discuss my issue with.

It feels insulting to be lied by a business that I just purchased lunch from.</Text>

< review>
Worst place I've ever been to as I was about to order I wanted to us the restroom first the old lady told me no customers only. I wanted to use it before i  ordered if she wasnt in a rush to push me away I would have stayed to eat. Im a assistant manager for a grill myself and thats the worst hospitality ever!!<//review>

Very rude. The moment i asked for the restroom key after we paid for our food she grumbled and gave me the scowl of the year and proceeded to speak spanish while making eye contact with me. For NO reason at all. Definitely upsetting. I wouldnt recommend this location.</Review>

Pretty good place.  Service was excellent.  Most of the food was really good. The only complaint or negative really would be the "seasonal vegetables" an alternative to fries which weren't cooked thru and had very little flavor at that. It's weird to combine brussels and root veggies.  It just didn't work texture or taste wise.  Hopefully they fix that otherwise the chicken sandwich (grilled instead of fried) was epic flavors + thanks to our server for making that recommendation!< /Review>

The bar staff was amazing! Enjoyed people watching from the balcony and the food was delicious. Tried every tequila drink...they were all refreshing and not too sweet.</text>

We visited during covid. Outdoor dining and the team wore protection.

Food was good but the wings were so spicy. If that’s your thing, great, but for me it was too much.

Pizza is smaller than described but tasty.

With consistent A+ service, high quality seafood dishes and uniquely prepared cocktails, Tower 12 has become one of my very favorites. Phenomenal service by Bree on this visit, my friend and I ordered the same items that were as delicious as before – fresh halibut sashimi and tuna poke avocado with a zest. The only negative is that their cocktails are so delicious but it’s tough to decide which one to try each time! A pretty good problem to have, as they are always “out of this world.” Family owned and run, Tower 12 has always provided the friendliest professional service, and I leave, already excited to return.</text>

They have a great covid setup. You can be inside the restaurant! But there are enough windows and a patio feel so I guess they're able to offer this option. Food is good and they have a nice beer menu. I was able to be seated immediately. But I was there on a Monday night. So you might want to call ahead. It's on the second floor and the entrance is down a little corridor on pier on the north side.<//text>

Honestly if you black go literally anywhere but here. My friends and I were discriminated against by the hostess, manager, and a customer. We were denied entry due to “capacity” and couldn’t even have our names on the list. Yet after denying entry to myself and two other people we watched a group of ten enter. Basically if you black, trust me it’s other restaurants, better restaurants.</Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>I wasn't sure what to expect from Senegalese food, but I heard many good things about this place.  And the fact that it is in the Mission where many GREAT restaurants are, that added to it's credibility.  It was very crowded, but to me that is a good sign.  We had a group of about 10 or more and they accommodated us once our party arrived.  The service was great and the food was delicious!  Everyone in our party enjoyed their meal.  The fried plantains were a great way to start the meal, highly recommend you try it!  This restaurant was also pretty vegetarian friendly.< /text>< pictures>

They tell us the wait is 1.5 hours when we were meeting a party inside for a birthday. Never coming here again, waste of time. The whole area is not worth over an hour wait.</text>

<text>Love this spot. Cool atmosphere with open air which is perfect by the beach. Friendly and fast bartenders that make yummy drinks! I had a few too maybe Southside of the pier. Very nice drink.

The food was great. Hot wings were hot and delicious. Prosciutto toast was really tasty. Nice for a light dinner.

Loved the DJ. Great mix of music. Good crowd. We had a great time!!<//text>< Pictures>

Terrible experience. Was recommended by neighboring eatery that was closing for the evening. We are a mature couple and was pretty much ignored by the staff once we ordered our food. Had to ask for water refills multiple times. Ordered martini’s, received Tito’s vodka straight up, was told that is how they make martini’s. NOT ok, I would’ve asked for a shaken shot of vodka if that’s what I wanted. Ordered the margherita pizza, it was delicious, but soggy.
Probably great for people that like loud music and fruity drinks.<//review>

We made reservations for a big group.  They were helpful and patient.  It was a mellow vibe.  We came during happy hour and the beers were massive. We ordered meatballs, deep fried cauliflower, sliders, sandwiches, pizzas etc.

It turned into karaoke at 9pm on a Thursday.  Then it got crowded.  Too crowded.  A lot of baseball hats.  Bro city.</Review>

The albacore tuna burger is fantastic here.. This place has a large parking lot right behind it which is very convenient, Great location in the center of pier avenue.  with fantastic seatting and sports on every television. The staff is great. The service is fast. Everything is extremely clean.  Outdoor seating area to seat yourself that is covid compliant too.<//text>

We had Bloody Mary's.  The were adorned with deep fried bacon wrapped blue cheese stuffed olives.  Then had soft pretzels with cheese fondue that tasted like Welsh rarebit.  Waitress was friendly, helpful and attentive.  View from the upper deck was fun.  We will be back.</Text>

Located centrally by the pier and great for people watching since it is elevated above overlooking the walkway to the pier. Great menu selection and make sure you try the pretzel fondue.  The stuffed pizza is also amazing.  Prices are also reasonable.< /Text>

Pretzel knots are bomb. Great beer selection. Lacking vegan options.</text>

<review>I'm here on business for the week and decided I needed to come here twice this week. The first time I got an exquisite rustic vegetable salad.

Tonight I came back for comfort food. The chicken pot pie, pretzel and cheese, and brown butter mashed potatoes made for one legendary comfort food experience. And over looking the coolness of some restaurants on the Hermosa Beach Promenade.

My waiter was attentive and excellent. 😎👍<//review><Rating>5< /Rating><pictures>None< /pictures>< user_id>

We had lunch at bit after noon and it was nice and quiet upstairs. We had the meatball sliders, brisket sandwich and Waldorf salad-all tasty. Service was great and staff was attentive. We were able to get in and out within the hour.<//Text>

Solid place to watch football on saturdays. Service is amazing, especially if you get the “living room” area. Great drinks, decently priced and good is always good. Gets really busy so got to get there early and get a spot.<//Text>

<rating>3</rating><review>Tower 12 is pretty small when it comes to enjoying live bands play and being able to dance.  I believe the biggest downfall is the size of the area to dance when bands do play.  Too much of the servers having to walk thru the small dancing area.  Nice that Tower 12 is surrounded by other spots like restaurants, shops, bars etc.</review>< pics>

Great vibe and a really nice place to grab a drink.  Love all the nooks and crannies that you can explore.  Go elsewhere for food though.  Overall, the food is rather average.  In particular, the burgers are not worth the calories.  A great place to hang out and have drinks, but go to dinner elsewhere.< /Text>

<Review>The unlabeled hot sauce eye droppers that get served with certain menu items (eg brisket) are reused multiple times in a night without cleaning. This was confirmed by two separate employees while I was there tonight. This is a condiment that is served on your plate and appeares to be single serving. Unfortunately, it is not single serving.< /Review>< Pictures>

This place has SERIOUSLY upgraded. The vibe is clean and beachy and also sort of upscale. Bartenders and staff were incredibly friendly. Had a great birthday event for my cousin and had a ton of fun. Really enjoyed ourselves. Parking was easy. Not too crowded. Prices were typical. Drinks were strong. Food was decent. Cops n security were more laid back then I remember from when I was younger. Will definitely be back.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOI9CbOt0AlKgozsXmZHeqUpnbDdjsmsZNIUi31=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqljW2AfnH65cRZQpiBx70VMpPpW_QOb85S_d4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiBngJwe5xNdzzIdsH3wHWklm_AQfQuYneLF_C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMndZuZM_P3OJPM76lKqWjjR7NnBS3oWdyTqFnV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

Super busy place on a Friday night. They suggested reservations so we made them, walked a bit more along the strand and then returned for late dinner. The food was excellent and service was quite good in spite of crowd. A bit noisy due to crowd but balcony was beautiful and we still were able to have a conversation</text>

I hollered to someone who I thought worked there, for a menu, and HE just walked on by, and went to next table and took there ORDER. Not once was I acknowledge. By any staff member. Or offered a menu. I went on line to check the prices and there were none posted on the menu, as for the cleanliness the women trashcan could have used a trash liner.

This place is suuuuper cool. It can get really packed at times but it seems like it's pretty chill during the weekdays in the afternoon time. I really wish I could make their happy hour during the week which ends at 6pm but Tower 12 still worth going to. During happy hour, everything is extremely cheap. I've never had so much great food and drinks for such a low cost. If you miss the happy hour, it's better waiting until the next day<//text>

< Review>
I went to Tower 12 today to meet a friend from the East Coast who was visiting in town. We wanted to pick a place that was low-key and casual but had good food and a good atmosphere. We were not disappointed. The proprietor was the nicest gentleman and made me feel right at home the minute I sat down at the bar while I waited for my friend to join me. We had a long discussion about music and about the local beach scene. Our food was very good we had the Hawaiian style pizza meatball sliders and truffle fries. All of the food was very good served at the right temperature with all the right condiments. They have a good selection of beers on tap. I'm one of the best things was just the location itself period on a hot summer day it was nice to have a little breeze flowing through an open-air space where we could keep cool and still feel like we are outside enjoying the beach. I would definitely go back there again thank you for the great experience?< /Review>

<Review>Tonight I had the misfortune of running into a manager tonight by the name of Rodrigo. My sister and I asked an extremely friendly waitress that served us about a Mardi Gra bead  competition that was going on. We asked her two questions is the competition still going and if so how long. The waitress came back at around 9:40 pm and told us the competition ended at 11:00pm we asked 3 other employees working the bar and the door the same question they all said it ended at 11pm we told the guy at the door we would be back. We came back with almost 50 beads compared to every one elses 5 and 8 when we ran into Rodrigo at around 10:51 pm he let us know the competition ended at 11pm me and my sister thought great we will take the cash prize and by more drinks in 9 minutes... 2 minutes later Rodrigo tells us, the manager on duty changed his mind and the competition ended at 1 am in the morning which technically is a whole other day but we said we would rock it out. We got friendly with a female and a male bartender and asked them who is the manager on duty and imagine to our surprise they both said the manager was Rodrigo. We stayed and noticed no one else must know about the competition because literally every one had the maximum of 10 beads... we just about forgot about the competition when we ordered 2 more drinks and started zoning out to the music at the bar when Rodrigo asked us what are we waiting for. My sister responded to this extremely poor customer service and said were waiting on you. We then told him it was a little unfair to tell us the competition ended at one time but it's fine we will wait he responded and said  and I quote " I cannot change the time " me and my sister were extremely astonished at this customer service. Since we never go any where, what with my busy work and school schedule and her working for the police department we never have time to enjoy ourselves... we finally get to 1pm me and her are extremely tired and are ready to go when Rodrigo walks up to us and asks where are my Beads, since they were extremely heavy and was sitting on my neck for 4 hours I put them in my purse. he disappears and brings some random caucasian woman from the back with nearly 106 necklaces who hadn't been there all night. All the employees seemed to be very fond of this women which Is when I knew it was rigged. I was extremely dissatisfied and disappointed at this point the beads and the money meant absolutely nothing but for it to be the last day of Mardi gra and there to be no announcement, they didnt even stop the music they just crowned this girl that they gave beads too that everyone seemed to know (all 7 customers in the club lol) and I decided to walk out. I even asked him why are they making an announcement of who won the competition and he said to keep "we dont need to make an announcement " that is when I knew for sure they just through beads on this girl. I am not sure how Rodrigo (if this is even his real name) is still a manager but rest assured I will NEVER be back there as long as he is running things and i Highly recommended you dont either . patrick molloys has the BEST customer service and they are fair , i realize that's too much to ask for these days . I could not believe that I was treated so poorly and yes you already know what color my skin is by the way I was treated by Rodrigo...  if I could give just him negative stars I DEFINITELY would . Do not visit this establishment ESPECIALLY if you want a chill night, good music and good customer service and since sharkeez and this place is run by the same ppl please avoid at all costs ...<//Review>< Pictures>

Cool venue for music although very small.
Parking all around for a fee until 2 a.m.!
They have food & alcohol & a tiny bathroom.
It's open air which keeps it cool.<//text>

<Review>The Hermosa Beach Pier promenade is a happening place to visit. The location of the Tower 12 restaurant has been around for a long time but under another name.  It has been a local hangout where locals go during the week. Tourist flock there on weekends to hang out upstairs at one of their 2 bars and scope out the bikini babes below on Pier's walking promenade. If your in to  beers and  burgers  type places them this is your place. It can get pretty loud on holidays and weekends. But then most of the restaurants on Pier do also. If your looking for a quiet romantic place looking for that California sunset, this is not for you. Swimsuit and flip-flops are the norm. Their single cheese burger has 2 beef patties and the double cheese burger has 3 they say because the patties are thin. They do however have a good happy hour with 32oz tap beers and 22oz mixed drinks.

Relaxing vibe. Excellent atmosphere. Real staff. Genuine people who care!! Unique outdoor section. Excellent pricing on drinks!! And great selection of food! Perfect for the family during the day. But does have an older evening crowd typically past 8:00pm. Overall would highly recommend checking this spot out. It is a must.< /text>

Went here on a girls trip. There was a little wait, we went to the bar to grab a drink. We all order different drinks from the friendly bartender. The drinks were amazing! When we were seated it was in a cozy little couch area. We order the pretzels, with cheese and hot mustard. Delicious! My friend and I split the mushrooms pizza and ahi poke stack. They both were yummy! I put their spicy sauce on the pizza it just made it that much better. We had a couple draft beers with our lunch. Our server was so sweet and helpfully. Definitely a must go spot in Hermosa!<//review>

The pizza is about 9 inches in diameter and the only half priced drinks are fishbowls (totally worth it if you don't have work the next day). My group ordered the stuff crust which had mixed reviews between us. It's an ALL ricotta and herbs mix inside of what is basically a bread roll affixed to paper thin crust. The wings are awesome, with perfect "hot wing sauce". Their naughty mermaid drink is nice and light.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Watched as this place was being built out and suspected it would be a formula-bland watering hole, eatery. Not at all! This is a really cool bar/restaurant. Not sure I would classify it as a destination place yet, as in put it on your hit list if coming from out of town, but it is absolutely on the hit list if you are already in town. Check it out, you will enjoy!</Review>

Located up above Pier Ave, there are two sides to the establishment. The side facing the Pier Ave is the restaurant/bar area. The service is fast, good good for bar food, and the view great for people watching. It can get crazy busy here, especially in the evenings and weekends. A good place to go if you're looking for casual but better than most bar food!</Text>

<time>1538771047168<//time><rate>2< /rate><text>2nd trip to Hermosa Beach and 2nd visit to Tower 21. The first visit was pretty good, so thought we'd come back again.  The best part of the visit was the wedge salad.  That's where the good ended.  Ordered buffalo wings ... and for a dozen at $18 you'd think they'd be good.  These were dried out, cold, and tasted as if they were days old.  Told the waitress (,showed her actually) and all she said was sorry.  No other to fix it, replace it, comp it,  etc.  Just sorry.  Also, waited over 20 minutes for 5 garlic butter shrimp to be made.  Overall simply disappointing.</text>< pictures>

The dinner portion was even better, the stuffed crust meat feast lives up to its name. Wouldn't go here if you wanted to talk a lot though, it was loud enough that we were shouting to hear each other.</Review>< pictures>

They did a full remodel and the inside is super clean and sleek... think Nantucket Beach Bar vibe with amazing cocktails and food and super cook decor. For a place right on the beach the prices are totally reasonable too! All the staff is super friendly and they even kept the 6-Second Beer Challenge (FFFF Fans will know what I’m talking about). Last time we were in manager Will came up, checked on us, and made some awesome recommendations. He was totally awesome and embodies the overall feel of the place. I highly recommend if you’re in the area you check it out!<//text>< Pictures>

I love what they did with the Decor it’s so homie and it’s a different vibe. Just hate it on the weekends because of bunch of college students all want to cram up on these places and the rest of the block is dead lol. If you want to enjoy this place go early and on weekdays. Please bring sautéed mushrooms back to the location.< /Text>

Don't bother unless you're a local.  Multiple waiters ignored us to wait on their friends. We left after about 20 min without anyone saying anything to us.  It's like Jeff Spicoli's brothers work there.<//Review>

Great view and atmosphere.< /Text>< rate>

I ordered the fried cauliflower and a side of broccoloni. Everything was delicious, and I will definitely be visiting again. Popular spot for drinking and dancing on weekends, but the mixed drinks are pricey and very watered down.</text>

To all of you innocent fools who think you won a pizza party: they giving  personal/appitizier pizzas. Each pizza only feeds one person...out of the ten that you invited. Additionally, the cheapest half off drink is over $60. Even the waiters are frustrated with this scam!< /Review>

Atmosphere  and vibe is one of the best in Hermosa if not the best. They have all kind of set up in there , 2 bars , couches to sit and have conversation, dancing area , live music some days and they serve food although food is overpriced and portions are small . It is worth to check it out for couple drinks and have a good time .</Text>

If I could rate this place 0 stars I would. Unfortunately, this review is based on the culture of this establishment and not on its food. BOTTOM LINE THIS PLACE IS A RACIST ESTABLISHMENT so I definitely WOULD NOT RECOMMEND anyone to it for sure. On 6/2/17 I nicely went up to the gentlemen at the door and asked if they were letting anyone else in and he politely said no. At this point I didn't think anything of it since it was close to 1.  What I saw after is what pissed me off. They let two separate groups of white folks in right after they said they weren't letting anyone else in. That's BS to me. My group of friends watched this all go down... they wouldn't let a group of black and asian folks go in but they sure let white folks go in. I was super disappointed to say the least as I love going to Hermosa Beach and frequent there often. I have never come across this type of behavior at other establishments on the pier. I thought it was important and necessary to say something to the gentlemen I previously spoke with. As I walked back to try to speak to him,  he was acting like he didn't see me even though I was the only person in the vicinity along with the doorman. Since he wasn't trying to talk to me, I told the doorman in a professional manner that it was disappointing to see them letting people in after they just told me they weren't letting anyone else in. At this point the gentlemen decided to make a statement and defend himself saying it's not what you think. I reiterate that it doesn't look good when you just told me you weren't letting people in and immediately after let a group of white folks in but deny entrance to people of various ethnic backgrounds. His defense was they were service industry people. Sorry buddy that excuse doesn't fly especially when two separate groups go in from two separate areas. I've worked years in the service industry so I can acknowledge that we would frequent other bars after our shift ends but not in the manner that these folks were dressed. Cmon y'all knew what you were doing ... let's be real here. I don't use the word racist lightly when accusing someone of it without merit. I would hands down say STAY AWAY FROM THIS ESTABLISHMENT ... super disappointing.<//review>

Overrated place that seems a bit too overpriced. And they security guy at the door is not good at his job. Unfriendly to patrons. He alone made me never want to go back there. Decent chicken sandwich though.</review>

< Review>
Sorry gotta rant. Always a long line. Came down here to sign someone up as a favor for the hermosa beach iron man. Idk why they would do it in such a busy small restaurant. The door guy is new and has no idea what he's doing and panicked when I asked him a simple question as he told me to wait in a long line w the people who are there to Dine but let his friends pass through. Hmmmm. Called a manager to explain management needs to organize the front door and was hung up on. I wanted to dine here while on vacation but I'm set off by rude people and poor service.</Review>
