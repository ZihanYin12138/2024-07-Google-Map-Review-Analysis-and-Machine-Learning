Great experience.  The son who does a great job at running his dad's business, went above and beyond to help me out with a set of tires at an affordable price.  Will definitely be using him whenever possible for all my vehicle's</review>

Look no further.  This is the best tire place in town.  Miguel is definitely the coolest guy yo work with....he will work with you on what ever your budget is and provide you the best tires he has to offer for the money.  They have best selection of used tires in town.  This is the only shop you can find many name brands and in full sets in terrific condition.  You can tell a place is good when you always see a line of people going there and this place usually is that.  Regardless how busy though, they always manage to take care of their customers at a reasonable time while carrying a great attitude.  I cant say enough good things about this place.  Go check em out and you will find out.< /review>

Needed a good used tire. They took me right in and put a tire on my car that looked like it was new. I was  very pleased. They were so nice and helpful and the price was very reasonable. I left there very happy and will go there again in the future.< /Text>

These folks are great and super helpful. The service is fast and friendly, the prices are amazing with lots of options they will help you pick the right tires for your needs and your budget. They offer new or used tires (which look new) depending on your needs. A wonderful addition to our community.< /review>

Fast service. Cheap tires but make sure you check the age of the used tires by using the date code after the DOT letters on one of the tire sides before you buy. You don't want tires older than 6yrs old. They apply dressing to make tires look good and new< /Review>

These guys always get me a great deal on tires. I've never had an issue with my tires after I purchase them from here. Sometimes they take awhile to change them though. Expect to wait up to an hour sometimes.<//review>

< review>
Probably one of the best dental experiences I've had. Everyone here is real friendly and has good bedside manner. Recently I went in for a root canal and found the experience to be far less intense than I thought it was going to be. But before that work was to be done, I had to get a cleaning. Their hygienist Marie Rand worked on my teeth. What a nice gal, and her bedside manner is top notch. I was receiving a scaling and root cleaning/planing, which kinda hurts. But Marie was real professional and wiped it out in no time. I highly recommend Moorpark Dental Group and plan on continuing to go there.< /review>

< Review>
Marie is by far the best dental hygienist I have ever gone to. She leaves my teeth and gums squeaky clean. Her meticulous methods of removing the plaque on your teeth are gentle but yet through.  She explains the procedures and reasoning behind them ensuring I am marking an informed decision regarding my care. The office is clean and organized and I am able to book an appointment with Marie later in the afternoon which works best with my work/school schedule.</Review>

<text>I have feared and hated going to the dentist and the hygienist for most of my life. I've been going to Moorpark Dental for several years now and I am no longer afraid. Marie Rand is the best hygienist I have ever had! She is gentle, thorough and very personable! My teeth and gums are healthier than they have ever been thanks to her!</text>< pictures>

When I went to the Moorepark dental. The place seemed very clean and the staff was nice. What I didn't care for was that they are VERY sneaky about prices and testing that you clearly didn't ask for and said no for. My insurance paid my teeth cleaning, but apparently they slipped in some bonus stuff that I thought was covered and they stuck me with the bill. During the pandemic, losing both of my parents back to back. I didn't have a lot of money thrown around. I am no longer going to them. The bonus,  the woman who did my cleaning was nice, but she needed to be more careful. I not only got my tooth removed and the shots are painful, but she hit me in the head with the light and Iater got a big knot on my head. I left that place in tears. I accepted it as an accident, but still. Didn't make my visit happy and then I get stuck with a bill I didn't know I had. I think its a bit dishonest for my taste. I am going elsewhere.</review>

MDG is amazing and excellent customer service. I had a young lady which was a registered dental hygienist, by the name of Sahar. She not only had great chairside manner, but she was very gentle and curteous with my cleaning. I will be back for sure!<//Review>

<review>I came in for an emergency dental abscess. The front office staff was very friendly and empathetic to my situation. The office is immaculate and all the equipment is modern. Dr Huss and Dr Pena took great care of me on my first visit. Friendly and fast. When I came back for a check up, the same staff was still just as cheerful. Dr Huss examined the previous work and did a complete check up of my other teeth. Turned out I needed a deep cleaning, which to my astonishment, they were willing to do right then and there. I was then introduced to Dr Faal, the in house hygienist. She was equally nice and knowledgeable. I have felt incredibly comfortable with my visits to this office. They explain everything very clearly with a bright smile (even behind the masks, you can tell they’re happy to help!). If you’re searching for dentists, give this office a try. I’m happy to be a patient of Moorpark Dental Group.<//review>< pictures>

Just had my first SRP cleaning today with Sahar and had the most amazing experience. She genuinely made sure I was comfortable and talked me through the entire cleaning! Highly recommend her as a dental hygienist for any of your needs, she really goes the extra mile for her patient! 🤩🥳</review>

Dr Castillo and his assistant are sublime, professional workers. They pay attention to detail, and they are receptive when you talk. I have a very sensitive gag reflex, and they for once payed attention to that, other dentistry’s just try to make you tough it out, however not this practice. They gave me topical numbing solution diluted with water and numbed my throat so that I wouldn’t gag during the x-ray and it solved the problem. They were professional and kind throughout the whole procedure, Dr. Castillo even took extra time shaping my tooth making sure that it sits perfectly when I bite. Now, let me tell you about their dental hygienist, her name is SAHAR FAAL. She is unmistakably the best hygienist I have had in a long time, she is charming, on point, she makes you feel comfortable, and she is fast. She educates you about your own teeth to help you prevent future challenges with a smile. She asked me what music I like, and then played what catered to my needs and thoroughly cleaned my teeth In a fashion where I have no cuts nor bruises after the procedure. Here’s the kicker, she gave me two anesthesia shots and I didn’t even feel it. That is correct, she is a sharp shooter and she knows the skill of the trade. She is an exponentially talented individual who can match the mission statement of any business. Their workforce and management are streamline, professional and passionate about their work. This is a gem of a business I add my seal of approval to it.</Text>

<Text>First and foremost I have to say that this is by far, the best dentist office I have ever been to in 50 years of life! From the front desk, to the assistants, and so on! Every time I go it gets better. I had a crown fall out and the kindest dentist I've ever met, Dr. Huss, did not trick me into getting a new crown! He instead, was honest and told me that it was still good and put it back in, saving me thousands! Then I received the most fantastic cleaning ever by the most hip and amazing dental hygienist, Sahar, who made me laugh and played my favorite music! Again... best cleaning I ever had and was super sensitive to my finances ensuring that I got EVERYTHING I NEEDED, plus some! Finally, Dr. Molayen (periodontist) fixed my gums and my teeth feel 20 years younger. I was about to lose some teeth but he performed surgery on my entire mouth on the same day I went in because my insurance was fixing to expire! The sweet front office staff worked with me, yet again, making it doable by getting my insurance on board to take care of me that day, then included several visits after, on the house! I can't speak enough about these people! I'd rather pay cash out of pocket, then go anywhere else! Special shout out to Jorge who ever so kindly got me all set up. He took time out to do me a couple favors. Dr Castillo is just as wonderful, along with his adorable assistant Natalie! I wish I could remember everyone's name but all you need to do is remember MOORPARK DENTAL  GROUP! THERE IS NOT A FLAW IN THAT BUSINESS!< /Text>< Resp>

Friendly and helpful staff. Dental hygienists Marie (on sick leave) and now Sahar, have both been wonderful. I've had two visits with Sahar this year and she always has some useful tips for me to improve my dental hygiene, such as letting the electric toothbrush do all the work and to brush at a 45 degree angle.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I had a deep cleaning with specialist Sahar Faal. She took great care of my teeth, reviewing everything she was going to do in great detail prior to the service so I would be well informed and prepared.  She even allowed me to play favorite music during the whole service.  It’s little things like things that make a difference from a regular service to a amazing one.

<Text>Went over here in Feb March to get one issue fixed and doc suggested so many other things which is still fine. But when we asked to just get primary issue fixed first and with a simpler option instead of their suggested 9-10 times costlier option these people didn't even care to schedule something till date for me. These people won't take care of the simple issue unless I am ready to spend thousands. Even the service on my first and only visit was pretty bad, they do not care about people time.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I’ve been nervous to visit a dental office since COVID started. I was due for my yearly cleaning this past March, but instead opted to pass. The year is about to end and I can feel all the gunk, plaque and late night snack snacking remnants hanging around. Sahar, the registered dental hygienist recommended her place of work and told me that she herself would have family come here. Knowing that she takes every precaution, is very clean and professional I felt safe coming here. Sahar made time fly by as she was cleaning my teeth she educated me about my dental health and how to prevent and cavities and maintain proper hygiene. My sister and I both had our teeth cleaned by Sahar. I would never tell my own sister to come if I felt this place wasn’t practicing safe measures. I trust Sahar and know that her experience, professionalism and love for what she does makes Moorpark Dental the place for my family and I.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I came in to get CBCT scan for a future implant, and the wait time was short and sweet. I was greeted in a kind and timely manner, they took care of me so fast. The front desk was on point with my insurance benefits, the assistant Jesus was fast and efficient with the scan, and I had some questions about a dental cleaning. So the front desk personnel asked the hygienist Sahar to answer my questions. So when she came out, she was very comforting, and really great. She answered all my questions about what kind of cleaning I need, and why. She was very formative and professional. A true gem. I am so happy that she was able to give me the best care possible and attend to my hygiene needs. I cant wait to come back for my implant and my hygiene appointment. Even the other patients in the waiting room were raving about her. Dr. Huss and his team are amazing, and they truly know how to educate patients and treat them with dignity and care.  Thank You Moorpark Dental. I can't wait to come back again for treatment!!!!!!!!!!- Fred<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>My girls go there. My youngest one had several cavities and she is very afraid of the dentists it is almost like a phobia. She freaks out even during a regular checkup. Dr Castillo had a lot of patience and was very gentile with her and was able to do several fillings! He is very good! The waiting period of time is very short and the stuff is nice!</Review>< gmap_id>

Before I start it is so important to know that this dental office is open now and serving all types of needs. They take every precaution and enforce social distancing. You can be confident your safety is their first priority.

Dr. Huss,
Thank you for your team. This group of people truly define what it means to be a team. I haven’t been the most pleasant patient to deal with on several occasions due to discomfort and bone spurs. What truly sets you all apart is that you all handled it with care and compassion and at the end of each visit I felt grateful for having went. I even had work done by you on one occasion and that speaks a ton for your character as a leader. Thank you.

Dr. Castillo,
This is arguably one of the most patient guys I’ve ever encountered. Although, I have not had but one visit with him I look forward to getting my teeth and gums back in order. He is an outstanding member of your team and I appreciate the approach he takes with patients. Thank you Dr. Castillo.

Dr. Yafai,
He is the Oral Surgeon here and this guys is a next level black belt when it comes to what he does. He remembers you even after first meeting you a month prior. Impressive. He is very good at what he does. I had a tooth extracted and could’ve fallen asleep on the table during the process. It was really the best extraction I could’ve hoped for. The staff who have seen my mouth since his visit have all said how well the site healed over and that is a small testament to his work. Thank you.

Sahar F. is one of the Registered Dental Hygienists at Moorpark Dental Group. I had my first visit with her 6/25. We started the visit by me expressing my ridiculous fear of dentists. She handled that in a way that immediately made my worries vanish. Her witty reply instantly changed my mind toward the positive. Go ahead, book an appointment yourself and call her a Dentist. You’ll see. Throughout the appointment I continued to be impressed by her precision, her control and her ability to continuously ease my mind in an uncomfortable situation.
At one point and several times thereafter I even noticed her sharpen her various precision dental picks. Let me tell you why this matters. Sharpening any instrument is a skill that is acquired and in order to be successful at it you must practice an awful lot. Many professionals will ship this task out to others, but the ones that take the time to develop this skill themselves are exceptional when using their instruments to perform their craft. You can tell the difference immediately. Sahar, Thank you for being an amazing example of a true professional. Your service based heart and the way you care for yourself is reflected In the way you treat your patients. I highly recommend you book that next deep cleaning with her. You will not regret this.

Last but certainly not least, Miguelina.  Miguelina, is an amazing asset to this team as well. She is always concerned for your comfort and wellbeing as a patient and has an amazing memory. I promise, you will feel like she knows every single persons name who goes through that doorway. You will feel welcomed and like a VIP every time you encounter her. First impressions of a place often tend to be flat and generic. The bar for what to expect from a Dental office was definitely raised as a result of her. I wish you guys nothing but success for many years to come. Thank you for all you have done and will do for me.

AM.< /text>

I’ve been seeing Dr. Huss ya MDG for over 3 years now. They always get me in right away and make the process as quick as possible.
My last visit unfortunately happened in the middle of the COVID pandemic, I had to have an emergency extraction and Dr. Huss and his staff did their best to make sure I understood what was happening and that I would be okay even though it hurt now.
The icing on the cake was the call I received from Dr. Huss a week later checking in on me. I work in health care and it’s always comforting to know that there are doctors out there that truly care about their patients. I will continue to come to Dr.Huss and MDG for all of my oral care needs (hopefully, not an emergency next time)</Text>

I am from Chicago but my wife is from California. She convinced me to go see Dr. Hoyle, as she said he was the architect of the mouth. I didn't know what that meant, but when my wife says to go I usually go. I was pleasantly surprised. I had 2 crowns put in and 3 hours later I was done. I have not had any problems at all. I mean no one goes to the dentist to have fun but given the situation it was relatively painless. I didn't have insurance in CA, so they helped me with a payment plan. I would gladly go back and I highly recommend them. Thanks guys.</text>

BUYER BEWARE--They bait and switch you from an offer too good to be true, for a plan so expensive, you'll need financing or to break into your emergency savings to pay for it.

I moved to Moorpark  in 2015 and was way overdue for my routine six-month cleaning and check-up, but since this has been an aberration in my overall adult life of dental healthcare maintenance, I was surprised with the first-time new-patient examination findings.

I went to the clinic thinking this was a great deal--an exam, x-rays, and a cleaning for a low price of $59.00.   Their disclaimer that you only get the cleaning if you don't have periodontal disease didn't concern me, as I was confident that didn't apply to me.   A simple ordinary tell-tale sign is my gums don't bleed when I floss, which is daily, no less than once a day, though often more often, to remove any food stuck between my teeth.

The x-rays were a cheap quality and type, and several of the tooth images didn't come out and so the technician kept repeating them, giving me more radiation exposure each time, and until I realized this was a chronic issue with either the machine or the software.   At first I was very cooperative and flexible.  But when it became several times where the machine wouldn't perform, I lost faith in the equipment they were using and in their process.

Then I got the exam from the dentist, who was very cordial and friendly and made great small talk.   He said all my crowns, and fillings looked fine.   He told me what I knew, about my receding gum lines, something I was aware of and have always been told can be managed with good oral hygiene and diet.  But then he told me the bad news.   I had severe periodontal disease so I couldn't get the cleaning I had come in to receive.   The dentist said I needed laser cleaning and resurfacing  or planing, or something like that--a procedure that would cost me thousands of dollars.    Then then handed me off to their financing and scheduling plan coordinator.

I was upset and said thanks but no thanks and I got a second opinion from another dentist in town.

I needed a cleaning, and I welcomed a real exam and set of x-rays that were clear and complete.

It is my personal opinion that Moorpark Dental Group and Orthodontics is a scam.  I feel I got ripped-off  with their bait and switch from an offer for a very inexpensive exam, x-rays and a cleaning for a price too good to be true, to reel me into a very expensive and questionable treatment I didn't want or need.

BUYER BEWARE!   If they tell you you need their laser treatment for periodontal disease, hold onto your wallet and go get a second opinion.  I feel really ripped off.   I want my money back.<//Review>

<Review>This is a great place all around. I've been seeing Dr. Huss for a few years now. He also sees my 4 kids. He has a great sense of humor and makes you feel comfortable, and my kids don't dread going to the dentist. Dr. Huss gives the best care and is passionate about what he does.  It's refreshing. He is so informed and up-to-date on new procedures too. The staff is very helpful and friendly as well - not pushy at all. Also, two of my kids have braces and it's so convenient to have a good orthodontist in the same office.</Review>< pics>

This was by far the best dental experience I have ever had!  Dr. Magdos  was not only the nicest Dentist that I have ever been to but she was gentle and listened to all of my concerns also. She explained everything thoroughly to me, the prices were better than any office I've been to and she didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need. She was very fair and made me very comfortable. The entire office was  fantastic! I know I can trust my dental care to Dr. Magdos. Five stars to everyone at Moorpark Dental Group, I would have given them 10 if I could! I can now say I look forward to going to the dentist.< /text>

<review>The receptionist lacks the basic skills necessary to perform her job. She was rude and I could tell that she had been rude to other customers. I was also told that my dental plan was not active when in fact it was still active. I was able to schedule an appointment in a different office. I will never refer anyone to this clinic ever again. I also notice that the supervisor did not bother to get involved until I told them I was going somewhere else. I asked for a complaint form and I was told that they did not have any forms.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I personally had by braces here and the device is just terrible. The customer should always come first in their service. The staff are always having conversations and taking an over needed time to preform a simple process. DO NOT RECOMMEND.< /review>

I went in to get some work done. Did I get anything done? No, I just spent an hour on my back listening to sales pitches about how I needed to spend at least several thousand dollars, when my last dentist only charged me a few hundred for the exact same thing. They basically tried to scare me into handing them my check-book, and diagnosed me with several new diseases, each of which will cost hundreds and thousands of dollars to treat. Funny how the dentists I saw right before this and right after this missed all that.<//text>< GmapID>

Had a crown done a while back at Moorpark Dental. Moved to Vacaville for job. Obtained two different professional opinions on crown work done at Moorpark Dental and both dentists stated sub par crown placement and work done. Thanks to Moorpark Dental I have to pay for a new crown and work to fix there screw up.<//Review>

When I went to the T-Mobile store to buy a new phone, Sergio was extremely helpful and informative about the products and how to gain the best possible deal on them. Also, he did a great job putting on my screen protector and I was really grateful for his help in transferring data over from my old phone. Overall, I had a great experience there.< /Review>

The best customer service ever! I needed to add a line to my plan and upgrade my phone and all the staff went to the extra mile to ensure we were taken care of. They made sure our devices were working correctly and even took the time to give a tutorial on the new devices.< /Review>

I stopped by the shop on my way to LAX to get 2 SIM cards for my family. Savana and Josh tried to  issue the cards. However, they  failed to issue the cards and I got late for the airport . I guess Ill never learn that T-Mobile is a real bad service company. The place is very conveniently located in Seal Beach 🏝, just off Interstate 405. Tow stars for the good reception and location.< /review>

<Review>Don’t trust the t-mobile representatives at this store. When we came to switch over to T-Mobile last July, the sales representative, Brice, offered us a promotion: to trade in our iPhone 8 devises for new iPhone 11 devises. No contract and no strings attached. They assured us that we could always switch to another carrier penalty free. We are moving soon to a location that doesn’t have t mobile coverage and we just learned that we owe thousands of dollars to T mobile because the store mislead us. I was just trying to speak with the new manager, Jennifer and she hanged up on me. And the store won’t even pick up my phone.< /Review>< gmapID>

Nice people but please for the love of God stop wasting time with small talk with other customers that you're supposed to be helping. I walk in and I see both employees busy with customers. One employee is actually doing something and getting a couple of phone while the other is just making small talk. I'm not here to listen to Mindless small talk when an employee is clearly not doing anything except standing there and talking. If you're not going to help the other customers then at least help me otherwise don't waste time with needless small talk and take care of the other customers and then come to me.< /text>

<text>We can't support this store enough. They transferred four lines from another carrier and took us through the process easily. Pricilla, Jeffery and Luis represented their company well. Separating from the other carrier was the hard part, but T-Mobile support made it worth our time. Huge savings on the current four lines for $40, unlimited plan. Thanks!</text>< pictures>

Sadly, he went on break when I arrived and I was stuck dealing with a guy who was horrible! I bought the s5 and paid cash. He didn't set my phone up correctly, didn't transfer my contacts, was apathetic about the entire sale and almost forgot to set up my new blue tooth. All of this took 2 hours! I'm 9 months pregnant and standing that long was very unpleasant.  If I shell out $800 cash I expect some type of quality service.</text>< response>

<name>Kay P<//name><resp>None< /resp><review>Staff was very unprofessional and not helpful at all when I needed a replacement sim card. I've been a customer for years and used the same sim card the entire time and the staff wouldn't offer me a replacement. Instead they wanted 15$ for the chip. I mentioned that the chip was being sold for $0.99 on their website after the 'SIM99' promo code and they thought it was a funny joke as if I was buying out of some garage sale. T-mobile needs to hire people who take the time to inform themselves of their own company's products/promotions and know how to treat their customers.

Overall, I had a poor experience here with unprofessional/ignorant staff. I would not recommend coming here nor should T-mobile sustain this store's employees.<//review>< UserId.>

I called the store to find out why the service was so slow on my Hot Spot. I was told to call "61" on my cell phone - of which I had none. I was told this was "the only way." WHen I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was cut off.
Rotten is a kind word for this kind of service.</Review>

Love this place.  The avocado almond ice cream was lovely:  not to sweet.    The staff was very kind.   I recommend Pop's highly.</Text>

The creme brulee inside the coconut was delicious.  I had 2 choices of ice cream, I had the horchata, and the guayaba with cheese ice cream.<//Review>

Great spot for a cold treat, ice cream flavors are the real deal. The ones I have tried have been good, you can taste the natural fruit/nutty taste. Place was empty when I visited, some street parking available in front or there is a lot in the back of establishment. Prices are on the high side but for great quality ice cream, it is worth it.< /Text>

Pop's homemade ice cream with exotic fruit flavors is such a delightful gustatory experience!! If you are okay to settle for some cheap sugary Frozen Dessert, this is not your place. But if you enjoy a sublime complex tour of flavors & textures,  do yourself a favor and visit this place! Truly a Hidden Gem in Los Angeles!!< /text>

The service was ridiculously slow here - it took over 20 minutes to get ice cream. They made my order wrong, and when I asked for my money back the guy working told me nobody had ever left dissatisfied and didn't know how to refund me. He tried to offer me what I had originally ordered instead - a sundae - but didn't have enough ice cream to make it in the flavor I ordered.</text>

Pops is one of my favorite ice cream places.  Their ice cream are made of most exotic fruits.  Every flavor is delicious and bring childhood comforting memories.  Due to this reason I had decided that they had to cater for my sons first birthday Party.  The owner Marthin made sure to answer all my questions.  Make flavor accommodations, they had the patience serving our family and friends, explaining of flavors and ingredients used , while serving.  I could not ask for more.  Marthin and his staff were an amazing success and hit for this birthday party.  The catering price was reasonable for 100 ppl. Compliments have not stopped since.  I could not ask for more.  I’m very thankful and look forward hosting future events with POPS!

Flavors catered:
Mamey
Cacao
Sugar corn
Arrayan
Cashew fruit (marañon)
Nance< /Text>

Absolutely the best place to get ice cream in the San Fernando Valley, and perhaps all of Southern California!!! Every flavor that's created, seems to come straight from the depths of their heart. There is so much passion in every single flavor and each and every scoop! I love the sincere energy and extraordinary customer service! I always feel like a friend when I walk in, and family by the time I walk out!

Rudy, Marthin, Damon and the rest of the awesome crew go above and beyond to make sure I'm choosing the best flavor ice cream (or combination of flavors) for the day... and they get it right every time!

Never have I felt so excited to visit a place for ice cream until I discovered POPS!!! I highly recommend the ice cream, family sport, and the life changing experience shared among the most uniquely created flavors in the world!!! Hands down one of my absolute favorite places!! Oh yeah, two more words: Yum Yum!!!<//review>

The ice cream itself is made in house and is  very delicious. The taste is natural, no sweeteners or too much sugar.<//Text>

<Text>Went in once. there was a worker, Aaron, he was so helpful and honest and accommodating. The ice cream was phenomenal and completely worth my drive, I forgot which flavors I got but I remember them being so good because I talked about this place for days afterwards. I'll probably go back tonight because I promised my sister and cousin ice cream.
Anyways, thank you Aaron for making my first Heladas Pop experience great and informative.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c291ca409245cd:0xe0def8062436130</GmapID></record>

<text>Helados Pops deserves the #1 title for ice cream and sorbet in L.A., and for reasons beyond the sweet treats they offer. I've become a regular after randomly stopping by to satisfy a sweet tooth during my search for top quality local spots. My expectations were shattered and it was hard to believe that I just happened to cross paths with this gem.

Pops far exceeds other ice cream shops for a few reasons: unusual & exotic flavors, skillful & passionate ice cream making, and a true passion & closeness that extends beyond the business and to the customers. Marthin, Damon, Rudy, and the rest of the team make you feel like family with every visit.

If you're looking to cool off in the L.A. heat, Pops is highly recommended, and not just for the cold treats--but for intricately strategized ice cream and sorbet flavors you've never had, as well as a welcoming atmosphere with people who will talk with you and even educate you during your visit.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I don't usually care for the flavors at these "home made" type shops but these flavors were fun and delicious.  And pretty much unlimited samples to really get an idea which flavor you like.</text>

I pass by this ice cream shop all the time, it's on maclay so if I'm riding my scooter around town I always come up this street.
I'm soo glad and not glad I did lol

-glad because they have some awesome flavors
-not glad because I'm gonna gain weight now that I know they have amazing flavors lol, so close to where I live.

I waked in and was greeted by a guy which instantly wanted me to try different flavors lol.
I DID not object hahaha
I literally almost tried everything and ended up taking home:
Nance!
Mango!
Horchata! And Lucuma!

Yumm
Reasonably priced not like the crazy expensive ice cream joints popping up everywhere.
Local business.

It's great to try if you are around San Fernando</text>

(Translated by Google) The snows are very tasty, personally I don't like coconut like that so hard, I only bought it because it was my first time and I was tempted to buy it like that but I think that next time I will only buy a glass, the snows are delicious, very rich 👍🏻

(Original)
Muy ricas las nieves, en lo personal no me gusta el coco así tan duro solo lo compre por que era mi primera vez y me dio tentación comprarlo así pero creo que la próxima solo comprare un vasito las nieves son deliciosas muy ricas 👍🏻<//Review>

The only complaint I ever had was the mechanic left the inside of my car dirty but as soon as I mentioned it they were quick to have it taken care of. Kitty is the main lady that works with you and she is so sweet and always takes care of anything you need, even as far as reaching out to the warranty company for you. She is very appreciated for going out of her way to make things happen for you and go more smoothly.<//Review></record>

My truck that I purchased 13 months ago I was unable to get in before the end of year annual service because my schedule does not meet our schedule. I work out of town, I'm a commuter and have an essential role in my job. That along with COVID 19 it was difficult to schedule. I tried to tell you twice when calling into schedule and seems your scheduler did not car. So I ended up paying over $160.00 for an oil change and tire rotation, this was wrong, and unethical. The CS rep called GM to see if they'd extend my 1 year service a month since I only had 6000 miles on my truck, with very little effort on her part she accepted their "NO" and left it at that. I'm very angry about this I feel the dealer took advantage of the situation. Also, it's hard to hear with those stupid masks on and I have a hearing loss due to my military service.</Text>

I had a 7:45am appointment but apparently so did a fleet of trucks. I was worried I would not see my car until way past it's scheduled time. I was pleasantly surprised when I received a call saying it was complete on time. The Service department as always exceeds my expectations. I wish I knew everyone I dealt with to give them individual praise. One person I have had the pleasure of getting to know over the past 16 years is Lenora. Always professional, courteous and friendly she is a true joy to be able to interact with. Thank you all.<//text>

<Text>I live in LA where they are many Chevy dealers & ended up driving 200 miles north to purchase my Camaro ZL1 from Madera Chevy. That should tell you how they treated me.
From the time when I first contacting this dealer inquiring about the car, through making the deal, taking delivery & follow up calls afterwards to make sure I was taken care off.
Everybody I dealt with conducted themselves very professionally, did exactly what they said they would. Which is not so common nowadays.
There were not so many of this model car Camaro ZL1 available here in LA, most of the local dealers in LA had an additional markup over MSRP - which nobody wants to pay more than sticker.
Madera Chevy were not so greedy & offered a fair price on the car.
I have purchased over 25 new commercial & personal vehicles over the last 30 years and this dealership is one of the most professional & easy to conducted business with.

Both John in fleet Dept & Robert in Sales Dept, went out of their way to help me.
I did most of the paperwork over the phone & via email with Angela's help from the customer service dept.
Very fair competitive pricing and excellent customer service,

Some of the local chevy dealers here in LA should take some lessons from Madera chevy in how to treat potential customers. There was no hard selling or playing any games.
Just a fair, honest deal without any of the LA car buying drama.

In the past, I would never spent the time to write reviews on any given business.
But as a business owner myself, I appreciate & respect a well ran business & felt this company was worth taking the time to share my experience with other potential car buyers..
There are still some car dealers out there that conduct themselves with some oil fasion good values.

It was well worth the drive back, enjoying our new Camaro & avoiding tickets.
I would recommend checking this dealer out if you're in the market for a new chevy car, they also have a Toyota dealership as well.
Good luck.</Text>< Pics>

He was patient with us during our negotiations and was very calm and showed great poise under pressure.

I set up an appointment two days ago to come look at a used Volt. The individual I was supposed to meet wasn't there and they had to go look for the car. The sales associate I ended up talking to knew nothing about the car, but he found another associate who was able to give me inaccurate information (info was for the latest model year, not the 2014 I was asking about). I was then surprised when he asked if I wanted to test drive the car as the battery only had 5% charge and barely a gallon of gas in the tank. He was somehow confused at how I knew this information so I showed him the readout on the dash. He then found the charger and suggested we use the 4 to 10 hour charge time to "hammer out a deal." Oh, he also had no idea where to find an outlet to plug it in... That's when I left.</Review>

<review>Found a great deal on a new 2015 Camaro SS from the Chevrolet website that had been sitting. Checked the dealer website and it turns out the vehicle was on special. Headed down from Clovis unannounced and was promptly greeted by a sales woman Isabel. After a walk around and test drive we started the negotiations. I got what I wanted for my trade in with out issue and was never pressured to buy an extra I didn't want. In the end I left with a brand new car I thought I could only afford used. My best car buying experience to date.</review>< pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I was first contacted via Internet based on my interest in a vehicle. After looking around I inquired to the specific vehicle I wanted.  When I drove into the  lot they had the truck I was wishing to see out front and a sales person was ready to help me. My friends and I had been on a 5 hour trip searching for what I wanted. And what I wanted was right here in Madera. Robert English our sales person, made us feel right at home. The entire dealership was friendly and even Angela who contacted us via Internet and who we contacted later, came out to greet us. We were overwhelmed with the honest, professional and heartwarming demeanor of Robert English. He thoroughly explained all the features of the  truck and options available at purchase. The contractual aspect of the purchase was explained and easily understood and completed quickly. Also, the vehicle I wanted was exactly what I wanted  for a better price than the other dealers. It was detailed and gassed up and ready to go. My friends were treated like family and with respect. I indicated my next purchase will be here and I will contact Robert at Madera Chevrolet.  It was a refreshing experience and I definitely notice the difference in atmosphere and treatment compared to other dealers up North. Definitely worth staying local getting family style treatment. Thank you Madera Chevrolet. You have a customer for life.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Was looking at prices for a truck for some time, when one of my friends mentioned he just got a new vehicle from Madera Auto Center and to talk to Miguel Bravo. Went to Madera Auto Center, talked with Miguel for a bit, walked me around the lot. Came to a brand new 2016 Silverado for 33k. and that was by far the best price I've seen for a brand new truck. I wasn't planning on getting a new truck at all, I was looking for used. But this deal was too great to pass up. Experience was great, with Miguel and Tony in the finance department.< /text>

Local area resident, have never heard any bad conversation about the dealership, checked their inventory and they had close to what I wanted so I checked it out.

<review>On Friday 3/24/17, I took my 2013 Chevy Malibu in to the dealership because my check engine light came on, I was heading out of town so they reset it told me it was safe for me to travel and to bring it in when I got back into town, so I did. The day I took it in the check engine light still had not come back on NO lights were on, they fixed my car's problem over the course of 2 days, when I went to pick it up I noticed that my Service Airbag light was now on. I asked the lady who has always assisted me that it was on and she said to me 'it was on when you brought it in' I said to her NO it was not. there were no lights on. She proceeded to argue with me. I know my car I know my light was not on. If it was I would have asked them to look at that as well and it wasn't on any of my paperwork. So now i am stressed out and don't know where to turn for help. It going to be my word against hers.</review>< Gmap_id>

It was pleasant considering I am hard to content ,Robert was great I didn't think I would walk away with a good deal but I did ,I've been looking for a truck for 2 months saved for about 5 years and payed cash for what I wanted very pleased , took a while doing paperwork but I understand they had other people doing financing before me so I waited well worth the wait, if you're busy it's because you are good at what you do ,I would recommend them because I had 4 offers to get what I wanted but chose them , like I said I am hard to please I don't work for them or get a commission for my post just being honest.</review>

Madera Auto Center's slogan is "We'll Keep You Coming Back." After recently purchasing a car here, my family and I can confidently say that the staff at Madera truly live up to that slogan because of the experience that far exceeded our expectations.

When I contacted Madera Auto Center about the car I wanted, I was already impressed with the correspondence between Lisa Dodd and I because she was so polite, professional, and knowledgeable. She was such a pleasure to work with, and because of that we did not hesitate to work with the dealership despite being 130 miles away from them.

Unfortunately, we never got to meet Lisa because she was on vacation, but I'm glad to say our positive experience was maintained when she referred us over to Direct Salesperson Houa Xiong, who was really personable, well-mannered, and just a great person to work with! He had the car ready for us as soon as we arrived, and he made the transition into the finance office seamless. Lupe Martinez, the finance manager, explained the options for extended warranties/service packages and offered us packages that were actually catered to our needs. On our way back home we were even thanked by Lisa even though she was on vacation.

Madera Auto Center was a breath of fresh air compared to other dealerships. They are a family-owned business, and one of the few dealerships that still understands that the core of their business is based on the relationship with the customers. They really put their customers first, which was evident by the way Lisa, Houa, Lupe and the rest of the staff treated us when we bought our car.

I'm convinced that those who purchase a car will have an outstanding experience, and it will be so exceptional that they'll keep you coming back :).<//Text>

Houa Xiong (sales) was amazing, he was very knowledgeable about the vehicle I was looking for but also personable and funny. If you're looking to find a vehicle without feeling like the sharks are ready to attack; then I definitely recommend looking for Houa to help you in your buying experience. Tony Alvernaz (finance) was also equally amazing! He knew I had a strict budget and didn't let me leave spending a penny over what I wanted to spend... Tony worked his magic and I left Madera Auto Center knowing I got the best deal! Hat tip to both Tony & Houa you guys rock at what you do!<//Text>< UserId.>

If i could give zero star i would. I went to this dealership to get a truck and always have to negotiate with car dealers. (which is expected with every dealer nothing new) Negotiation was not the reason for this review that is part of business every day but was the way the dealership manager was very rude and inconsiderate. The sale man was very nice but manager needs to learn how to speak with his customers. I been in retail for 25 years working for multi-billion dollar company and never seen such horrible service. I WIILL NEVER set foot onto his property not even for services when i do find my truck. I would rather drive one hour to Fresno or Merced to get services done.< /text>< pics>

I've been eating street tacos my whole life. From my childhood in South L.A. to the neighborhoods of the O.C. (yuck) and even as far as New York, Orlando and Chicago, I've had street tacos all over. But in not kidding when I say that El Sapo is among my Top 5 taco places of all time. This is mainly for two reasons: 1, their lengua is beyond amazingly delicious & 2, their guacamole salsa is absolutely the best salsa I have ever had in my life. This is my go to place for tacos with my family and it's why I've been frequently going to them week after week for tacos and burritos.</Text>

<review>The tacos are not small....And, the meat is tasty. They give you cucumbers,  radishes, and grilled onions. One of the best trucks I have eaten at. The best thing for me is El Sapo is between my house and the freeway. Oh and the prices are good too.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>While on vacation,, we asked a few of the locals where we could find good Mexican food, and we were sent here! Tacos are super delicious! They also have great quesadillas. I usually get them for just the kids, but after tasting one, I went back to get one for myself! They have their own permanent parking spot, so that definitely says they are great!< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Very mixed feelings about this place, I wanted to give it 4 stars due to the fact they are open late and these guy seem to be working their behind off, however I can't for several reasons. 1st their Carne Asada taco have more meat than King Taco but it is not nowhere near as good as King Taco. 2nd and this is a huge problem for me, while I was there during Covid 19, cooks weren't wearing gloves and one used his shirt to quickly wipe his nose. 3rd, as you can see in the pic below they just let random drunk girls into the truck!!! 4th there were all sort of food hook-up at the back of the truck for people they knew! Please raise your standards!< /Review>< pictures>

I love this truck! The staff is super cool  And the food is some of the best Mexican food I have had. Their always open late and they always greet me with a smile and a kind "hello", makes me feel welcome! All around, this is just one the best taco trucks I've ever been to!  I drive from CSU LB to go here, that's how good it is! I highly recommend "El Sapo".<//Text>

<Text>They messed up my order... Twice!

The tacos are okay in general. Nothing to brag about but they’re cool. Only problem is they messed up my order the first time I went there. (I had it “to go” so it didn’t check until I got home) then the second time I went there I repeated my order along with my friends and they still messed it up.  (2 plates)  (It was also to go) 😑

I gave it a try but they let me down twice. Not planning on going back..< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< date>

<Review>These tacos are AMAZING! they're not stingy with the meat (which i love!) and everything is clean and organized (just customers makes a mess which is understandable) plus it's cheap. Also they are very considerate of their customers when it comes to the elements. They got your back. Your cold? don't worry fam, they got you a big lamp heater. It's raining? BOOM! THEY SET UP A TENT!!!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dd315dd4157a6b:0x3c347b73f9ecaf5< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Omg! What I appreciate about this wonderful taco truck is they make food like they were making their own plate for themselves or family. Seasoning always on point, the salsa Verde is beautifully delicious too! The red salsa is amazing but I can't hang bc im scary now that I'm in my late 30's..<//text>

<review>The tacos are really good, one of the best places to get tacos that are as close as you can get to over the border tacos in regards to taste. They have salsas, lemon, salt, and more for condiments and toppings. They offer more than just tacos like burritos and quesadillas and mini quesadillas all of which are really good. Not only is the meat meaty instead of fatty, it's also really good in price. I never knew why people would go to King Taco for over priced tacos with all fat. Now with this location here I hope no one goes to king taco so they can try real quality tacos. This is right around the corner from me and my new to go place for tacos and such.

They also have horchata and other refrescos to choose from. Currently they only accept cash.</review><name>Yareli Rodriguez</name>< user_id>

Had install of two new split-system A/C + furnaces, and two new water heaters, in addition to an install of a new 80' gas line run to the meter to bring it up to code (previous line was installed improperly by another plumber). Alan's crew was hard-working, punctual, professional, efficient, and friendly.  Install quality was top-notch, and they did a great job cleaning up everything afterwards.  Would highly recommend.<//text>

I simply cannot say enough positive things about Love's Heating & Air!  From start to finish - first touch to end of the project - Exceptional Customer Service and Customer-Focused.  My "Comfort Advisor" (how awesome a title is that?!?) Carl explained everything I had going on with my 18 year-old air conditioning system and what options I had to ensure I received the best outcomes all around.  The gentlemen who came out to do the work, and I do mean Gentlemen!, were outstanding individuals.  Jose, Juan, and Kyle - all 3 were a wonderful representation of what customer-focused service should look like.  Personable, hardworking, polite, kind, exceptionally clean and tidy in their work... like I said:  I cannot say enough positive things about my experience.  Thank you so much for all you do!  It was a wonderful experience to come home to a cool home!  Something I have not had for several weeks.  I appreciate you Love's Heating & Air!<//Text>

Loves replaced my 32 year old AC, furnace, and water heater on 8/4/21.  Matt, who is part owner, was very professional, yet personable and always promptly responded to my texts and phone calls.  Talk about a nice guy, when movers came unexpectedly during my consult to replace my refrigerator, Matt took it upon himself to help me to unload all of my food.
Alan, Ben, Nick and David, who were the crew that did the install, were a well oiled machine. Each member worked on their individual tasks, making the job go smoothly. All of them were friendly, respectful and didn't make me feel like an ignorant woman when I asked a question. I was impressed that all of the guys told me that they enjoyed working for Loves, which made me glad that I had chosen the right company that not only was good to it's customers, but also treated it's employees well.</text>

Manny came out to do an AC service/ check up.
He was amazing, very personable and professional.
He took the to explain the process and what to expect  should the unit wear out and need replacing. He saved me money by enrolling in a yearly plan so in October/ November they will come out and inspect the heater. The regular cost for the AC and heater service would cost more, so I saved money and instead of me having to remember to call them to come out, they will call me. Amazing service! Well done.</Text>

They responded quickly and professionally, lending us a space cooler so we could survive a hot weekend waiting for the replacement parts to arrive. They replaced our broken AC condenser with one that works way better than the old one ever did. The install guys (Alan and Kyle) were super friendly and my kids enjoyed watching them work.<//text>

Alan, Jose, Ben, Juan, Kyle, Nick and Matt were all at my house doing their jobs seamlessly. Each step was communicated with the next steps to come. It’s so nice to work with professionals that you can trust not to upsell you on stuff you don’t need or want. They gave me the best product and explained to me the detail behind why it was best for me.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1627669804724, 'text': 'We have a great team.

We were beyond thrilled to work with someone like Manny. He was the most knowledgeable person that had come out. He educated us on exactly what is needed. He made us chose Loves Air for our service in the future because of the experience he provided. Manny, you also made us feel comfortable. Thanks for your service and for doing it with a smile in this crazy heat!!</text>

<review>Ladies and gentlemen, apologies in advance for not sharing my experience with my new unit installation. First off, if your looking to purchase a new AC unit for your home, make sure you contact Loves Air and ask for Matthew French. He will give you a complete breakdown of what is what and the overall costs and special rebates. He is the man for all your concerns!

Secondly, the 3 gentlemen that installed my brand new unit were accurate, professional, cleaned up after themselves really well, had great communication with me during the entire process, and installed the unit according to all specs and layout directions. I could not remember their names but if a rep from Loves Air reads this, make sure those gentlemen get rewarded for their outstanding work and precise completion. Loves Air is the way to go if your wanting to purchase a new AC unit. Great job, gentlemen!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1627673335169, 'text': 'Welcome to our Loves Air family.

We left a message Sunday because they were unfortunately closed, but as soon as Monday came, we called as soon as they opened. We were immediately scheduled for someone to come out between 2-4 and received a call from Manny much earlier asking if he could come around 11.

Manny had been here to service our unit just two months prior and we were so happy with him, so we were happy to see he was the one sent this time. He was in and out in less than an hour, as it was a pretty routine issue and easy fix.

We had signed up for the Love’s Loyalty plan with Manny when he was here previously, and we can’t recommend it enough! We felt like we were put into high priority immediately and truly valued as a customer. We couldn’t be happier with Love’s!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>I received a very polite phone call reminder/confirmation the day before service, and then my technician confirmed again the same day, which was great. My technician Manny was very knowledgeable, polite, and helpful. He gave me a lot of useful information, and do not try to force any other services on me. He let me know about the importance of maintenance and checked each of my filters for me.

I called this company because their sticker was on the side of the AC unit in the house I bought. The AC line was frozen over. The first tech Mike came out and changed the filter and fixed my immediate issue. Thank you Mike! A few weeks later it wasn’t working again. Manny came out and he checked everything. He said there was a leak but it was late in the day and probably A good 130° up in my attic. Manny was very polite, friendly, unprofessional during his visit. He assured me someone would follow up with me the very next day as the office was already closed. The next day I received a phone call and they were able to schedule a tech to come out the following day. Every time I called they were able to get me scheduled within a day or two, which was fantastic considering it’s in the 90s outside. I really want to get my AC unit fixed this week because I have family coming into town next week. Another technician came over to my house today and he was able to find the leak and repair it. I asked him to take pictures, not only did he take pictures he also took a video for me to show where the leak was (you could see it bubbling) and an after picture once it was repaired. I cannot remember the gentleman‘s name that came out today, I know it also started with an M. I explain to him that I was working from home and would be on a conference call. He took care of everything for me.  This company did a fantastic job and their customer service was top notch. They will definitely be using them again in the future.</Text>

<Text>I had several equipment’s replaced at my home at Riverbank by Loves Air Company.
Matthew had explained the process and offered a great deal to make my home energy efficient. Matthew has years of experience and provided excellent customer service.
The technicians that did the job were Jose, Juan, Nick.
I had been around all the time when the work was performed that involved changing the AC unit, water heater and Compressor including sealing of air outlet inside the house and installation of monitoring devices.
The workmanship, speed and skills of these tech were highly above expectation. Not only did they complete in time but had presented to me a finished product showing the best of what can be expected out from professionals highly skilled in the respective areas.
I highly recommend this company and the techs to anyone seeking a professional service to get their household equipment changed by Loves Company.
The best part of all was they had answered all our concerns that reflected their thorough knowledge of the what they are doing.< /Text>< GmapID>

<review>My AC compressor went out a few days ago.  I called Simon at Loves and he was able to get a new AC to my house within 48 hours!   He made me a great deal on the new Rheem system that is way more efficient than my old system.  Marcos came out to do the installation.  This guy is amazing.   Very very professional.  You can tell he really knows what he is doing.  Grade A work.  I highly recommend Loves heating and Air.  Simon and Marcos were a pleasure to work with.  Very professional and very cool guys.   Will do business with them from this point forward.< /review><name>Steven Barnabas</name><date>1593714843379<//date>< userid>

I highly recommend Loves Air!  Manny came to flush our tankless water heater and also performed AC maintenance.  He was very knowledgeable, polite, clean, and professional.  He was eager to answer any questions we had and let us know what he was doing.  Very thorough!  10/10</Text>

Tech Nate was not only fast friendly and efficient, but called when on his way and early, A1 service and will use again!

<Review>After having no AC all weekend, I was excited to see Loves Air this morning. Alan, Ben and Kyle were very polite and extremely professional. I appreciated them laying down tarps to protect my floor/carpet. The team worked very well together and were extremely efficient with their time and mine. They removed my existing furnace and ac unit, installed my new system, and even vacuumed everything after themselves! I'm beyond satisfied with their work and overall an excellent experience! I would encourage anyone needing maintenance, repair or replacement to check out Loves! You won't be disappointed!< /Review>< Pics>

I can not express how happy we are that we chose LOVES to come and replace our air conditioning units. From the beginning to the end, they came through and did what they promised. On day of install (10/6/20)we had two great crews here, led by Alan and Jose. Both Alan and Jose were very informative, and professional. They explained what they were doing and why. They were organized and you could tell they knew what they were doing. Their crew was very polite and respectful to the fact that we had two young kids doing distant learning in our living room. At the end of the day, Alan and Jose stayed back and made sure everything was good with us and we didn’t have questions. I would absolutely recommend this company. This was a very big purchase for us because we did both our units at the same time. I am so happy with our choice to go with this company.</text>

<Text>Manny was outstanding, polite and professional. From the start he had on a mask and he put on shoes covers. We had been having on and off problems with our York heater.  He spent 20 minutes  trying to duplicate the problem but to no avail. Just after he left the heater went out.  I called the office and Tina was able to reach him. He turned around and within 5 minutes he discovered the problem.  He had to order the part and was back the next day to do the installation.  No more cold nights.  Thanks Manny, Tina and Loves Air< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Jose and Joel did a great job on our new 5 ton Rheem unit. Very professional and did their due diligence on proper HVAC procedures as far as evacuating the old system and installing the new system and trimming the charge on new system. AC works so much better now of course compared to our undersized Carrier unit we had before (original that came with the house circa 2005). Thanks Jose and Joel for the great installation job!< /Review>

<text>Glad I made the choice to use Loves!  Employee Matthew convinced us to use his company with his knowledge of not only his company's products and services, but that of the competition as well. He had excellent follow through without being pushy. Jose and his crew are currently installing our system. They are methodical and thorough, and even pay careful attention to closing the doors to keep our indoor cats. indoors!😁  The folks that I have worked with have truly impressed us...</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Called around to get service on my AC after it made a terrible racket then quite. Got several quotes on new systems as well as the repair of the old system. We decided to go ahead and replace our old system after 17 yrs of service. Loves not only came in at a great price with lots of extras but repaired our old system for free so we wouldn't be without AC the week and a half it would take til the new, more efficient unit could be installed.

Installation day: Jose and his crew were prompt and professional. Answered all my question throughout the install and after. We had a great experience with Loves and would higy recommend them.< /Review>

Manny has come to our home twice now, and I'm so happy to have found a company that isn't trying to upsell me or disrespect me. Manny is a true gentleman and made sure I understood the process and my unit! He addressed my concerns and really listened. I'll continue to use Love's as long as I'm a homeowner.
Thanks Juanita in the office, and thank you, Manny!< /review>

Hello. Manny came to do a AC tune up today. He was on time, very polite, knowledgeable and very informative. I learned a think or two from him on heating and air.
Thank you for the great service Manny.

Carl, the system analyst was very thorough explaining our system needs and all the options to consider.  His bid was very competitive and work was set up in less than 1 week.
The service technicians (Jose, Joel and Alan) arrived professionally dressed, with clean uniforms and were very friendly during the entire day long project.  Despite the hot weather (98 degrees) they cheerfully completed the job as promised.  Clean up was thorough inside and out.
They respected social distancing while inside our home.  Our duct system was redesigned to keep a problem room cooler in summer, and it worked beautifully.  They replaced smoke detectors, filters and spent as much time as we needed to answer questions.   In my own business, these are the kind of employees I appreciate most.  I highly recommend Loves Air for any HVAC needs.</review>

<text>I called Love's Heating & Air after receiving a mailer ad. I don't usually respond to those, but happy I did this time. I've had excellent service from each employee that I've come into contact with. Starting with Matthew. Great guy! My installation had a couple of challenges, BUT, Love's strives for excellence. AND, any time I call their office, I always get a person, not a machine. Juanita & Tina are always professional & helpful. Tech's Michael & Manny are awesome too! Very helpful. The unit that was installed has saved me a CRAZY amount of money on my propane and electric bill. So worth the upgrade.< /text><rate>5< /rate>< Response>

My old hvac system was 19 yrs old. Manny came out and put a bandaid on my system to cool my family off. He told me that he wasn’t sure how long it would hold up. He was so nice and professional. So we had Matt come out and bid our new system. Such professionalism is appreciated. We had a whole new system put in. The whole crew was awesome.</Text>

Our home central air system needed to be replaced. We had four companies come out and give us quotes but after Matthew from Loves came out the wife and I knew we didn't want anyone else for the job. Matthew took the time to explain the process, he showed us all our finance options and answered all our questions. On the day of the install Jose was our lead installer, he called ahead of time to give us an eta and showed up on time both days. Jose and his crew showed true professionalism throughout the whole install and made sure all working areas were spotless at the end of the day. Let's just say Loves heating and air does live up to their HeartFelt Guarantees.</review>

I called today because my AC wouldn’t come on. TINA tried to fit me in to today’s schedule. When there was a cancellation, she called  me & gave me an appointment for 11-1 today! So grateful for her effort & concern. MARCOS arrived right around 11. Checked everything, found a loose wire, fixed it, & my AC was working again! Grateful for his thoroughness! Called MATT who helped me with troubleshooting. Extremely grateful for their help, concern, & professionalism. So happy that I chose Love’s Heating & Air!< /Text>

<review>We had a new heater/AC system installed and chose Love's after using them several times for seasonal maintenance.  The whole experience was above and beyond expectations.  The Advisor, Carl, listened to our needs and explained everything to us.  We interviewed several companies but Love's had the best price and package.  The installers Justin, Ben and Juan were professional, courteous, and very respectful of shoe and mask needs during the Covid 19 pandemic.  They completed the full installation in one day, and cleaned up everything as they went and there were no surprises or add on prices.  We love the new system, and highly recommend Love's for any AC or heater needs.<//review>< user>

<review>First we want to thank Matthew for coming out to talk and help us on what unit was best suited for our house, he was very nice and professional as well. We were very happy with the team that came to our house and put our new heating and air unit. They were on time and nice and well mannered. They came in and didn’t leave a mess and got the job done!👍🏻 The one gentleman that really made sure our unit was running well and took very good care of us before he left. He went over all the paperwork and made sure what we had to send in for our rebate! His name was Justin  Diaz, very nice, professional and a great part of your Love’s Team! We love our unit it works so well very happy with results! Thank you, Love’s for taking care of us and sending a great team to install our new unit!  Thank You, Tim and Joanne Fairchilds  (Modesto, Ca.) 👍🏻😃❤️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️✨</review><user_id>114433210925514073711<//user_id>< GmapID>

My experience with Loves heating and air has been great overall.  Manny came out to my home this morning to get everything ready for the city inspector.  He was polite, respectful and professional.  The city inspector arrived while Manny was setting things up so he stuck around to make sure things went smooth with the inspection.  I highly recommend Loves and thank you again Manny for a job well done!

This was a fantastic experiance. Alan, Ben and Kyle were three of the most courteous, knowledgeable and hard working installers I have ever had the privilege of observing over the course of a day. They arrived on time and began a well planned removal of our old HVAC system and install of a new Bryant 5 ton, 14 SEER, 95% down-flow system. They also installed new smoke and CO detectors in all four bedrooms, and a new NEST thrmostat. I also want to give a shoutout to Mathew, our estimator. He gave one of the best presentations, covering all of the fantastic coverages and guarantees Loves offers. His price was competitive and met or beat five other companies that bid on our project. Well done all.<//Review>

Manny ruelas was my service tech back in January, and he did an awesome job! He Was very professional, kind, and honest. I just called them during this big heat wave (in May), thinking my A/C was going out. The gentleman on the phone told me to take the dirty filters out, and what do you know my A/C is working again. Super kind of them to help out over the phone. They forever have my business!< /Review>

< Review>
We have lived in our home for 30 years and this was the best experience we have ever had with a contractor.
Matt explained everything clearly before work started and was a pleasure to work with.
The crew installed our new A/C, tankless water heater and repaired a section of roofing in 2 days.
The guys know their craft well and I had a good time while they were here.
Highly recommend.</Review>

<Text>Love's did an incredible job for us. Matt took the time to meet with us on more than one occasion to thoroughly discuss all of the options and was patient in helping us make the right decision for our family. He was very professional and we never felt pressured to make a purchase. The installation was done quickly and efficiently. We are so happy we went with Love's and would recommend this company to anybody!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Our upstairs AC was out, so I asked around the Riverbank neighborhood, and I got a lot of positive info regarding Loves.  I called yesterday, Tuesday, and received an appointment for a technician to come out today, Wednesday, between 2 and 4 pm.  At 1:30 I got a call from Manny, telling me he was 45 minutes out and would arrive at about 2:15 according to GPS.  At precisely 2:15 Manny knocked on our door.

He was exactly as folks had mentioned about him--kind, friendly, respectful, relatable...He's a really nice young man.  He went straight to work on our outside unit and tested several things.  He then gave me some repair options and the costs involved.  I went with the least expensive of the options as the unit is 16 years old, and I wanted to get the most out of it that I can before I need to replace the whole thing.  Manny never pressured me one way or the other.  He just wanted to make sure I knew exactly what my choices were.

He replaced the part, and, after cleaning up, came into the house to collect payment, wearing shoe coverings and a COVID mask.  He verified the air upstairs was coming out cool, and offered to close our loft window for me.  Impressive.

I am happy to know to whom my first call will be when I have the next HVAC problem, and it WILL happen!  Thank you, Loves, for sending Manny our way.  We're enjoying the cool air.<//text>< pics>

<review>The techs are so professional and courteous- the office staff is beyond kind and if there is a bump in scheduling or delays, they take note and make it right. Our HVAC and solar is just 2 years old and had our yearly check up today and all went perfect- you can’t ask for more- and the majority of the staff are all family- how do you beat a family business that has their customers first- you don’t- especially when you need a professional during the COVID 19 pandemic- trust this company- they are us!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I had a great experience with Love’s from day 1. They were very informative and accommodating to my needs and my schedule. They worked with me to help me get exactly what I wanted, including an awesome new tankless water heater. Both Matthew and Simon (co-owners) came out to the house at different times to check on everything which was very much appreciated. Also, I can’t wait for my new windows to be installed throughout the house. I’m so happy I chose Love’s and I would recommend them to anyone!< /review>

I received a phone call from Loves Air General Manager, Simon. He was extremely apologetic about my situation that occurred. Loves Air seems to pride themselves in making sure every customer is happy. Simon has refunded my diagnostic fee and offered a free cleaning maintenance service at no charge. I am glad Loves Air reached out to make sure I was completely satisfied.

I called Loves Air based on their Google reviews to come out and do a diagnostics on my heating system. The tech came out at scheduled time and he was very friendly and went up and checked the HVAC system. He took about 20 minutes to do a diagnostics and told me the part was going to cost $700. I called another HVAC  company to get a second opinion. The other company spent about 45 minutes to do a thorough diagnostics and said I just needed to clean out my heating system and was only charged $150. Kind of disappointed in loves air that they didn’t spend more time to really diagnose the problem and I’m out $69 for a diagnosis that wasn’t the real problem. I’m glad I went with a second opinion and didn’t spend the $700 with Loves Air. I gave them a 3 star rating because the tech was friendly and they came at scheduled time.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

My experience from quote to completion was easy and professional. Matt was on time for initial appointment. He provided concise answers to all questions and arranged financing on the spot. It was easy. He is a proud father and family man and shows that every chance he gets.
The install was down on a timely basis by the " A Team " All professional at HVAC. Each had their own area of responsibility. All were polite  gentleman. They left the place cleaner than what it was when they started.
I have recommended them to friends, family and neighbors.< /Review>

Dealing with Loves was a great experience from the initial quote with Matt throughout the install done by Jose, Ruben and Jason. We had an issue with our flooring upstairs when removing the old heating unit, called Matt, and it was fixed within a couple days! Overall a very pleasant experience and the new AC works great!< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Love’s installed a solar system for me this month and I was impressed. I’ve been in the construction industry for 30+ years and have seen many contractors claim to be great when selling you a system so, I’m never impressed by this statement. Love’s just did an amazing job! Did it fast and VERY clean.
I don’t just look at the quality of the product, straight and unobstructed runs of the mechanical or price. All of which I require. But, when I saw the little things done correctly. Such as running the conduit along my foundation and leaving room for airflow to my foundation vents where every other install I’ve seen have obstructed these vents in this type of install. Basically what I’m saying is; The team of installers that descended on my house, not only knew what they were doing but, took PRIDE in it. Haven’t’ been able to say that for a while.
I highly recommend Love’s Air!! Oh yeah…. My first electricity bill was less than a carwash!! Keep up the great work!!

<review>Mathew and his team were awesome. I have known Mathew for a few years and when I needed a new AC unit I went to him first. We talked about several options and prices and in the end I took advantage of his free tankless hot water heater. This was a big purchase and Mathew made it easy, almost too easy at times. They showed up when they said they would and worked with my schedule. They did a great job and I had the work inspected by my own guy and he agreed that they did great work. I am about to have my final inspection done and expect to pass with flying colors. Thanks Mathew and your team.

<pictures>None</pictures><text>This company clearly puts customer satisfaction as their first priority. The Loves team was at my house all day yesterday installing a new heater and air conditioning system, and they were a pleasure to work with! Everyone on the team was polite, courteous, helpful, and careful with all my belongings. They left my home spotless and put back together after working in every room. They touched up paint where the new filter didn’t quite fit where the old one was and even helped me move a heavy barbecue before they left! When owner Matthew French noticed a small dent in the new air conditioner casing, he made sure that an unblemished replacement was found, delivered, and installed before the end of the day! Raoul, Marcos, Manny and Reuben were all cheerful and courteous and made it easy to cope with having the whole house turned upside down! I would highly recommend this company for all of your hvac needs!<//text>< rating>

I needed to replace my a/c unit on my house. I had a couple different companies come out and give me quotes. Loves was by far the best choice! I spoke with one of the owners Matt and was quoted on a price for replacing my unit. His team came out and took care of business, after further review I was told and shown my ductwork was in real bad shape. They replaced all of it at no extra charge because they stuck to their word on the quote I was given at first, no surprises no extra fees! The best part of it all is that with the unit I bought there was a $500 rebate, but the money had ran out.... Well no worries because loves took care of me on that aswell! Matt met up with me and personally handed me a check for the $500 because they care! Awesome people, awesome experience.<//text>

<Review>The gentleman ( Manny)  was professional and courteous.  Gave me all of the information about how to maintain and keep the unit running at optimum levels . Explained all of what was done and why and that there is a warranty on the new part . I appreciate the great service .< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Brought my new doggy I got from the pound a month ago, I didn't know anything about the different styles of cuts for dogs either. I received great service from the initial phone call the evening before all the way to the price of and actual job. So as new customer I highly recommend this place.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpDP-Yfg4rXk2m5whEUlpGFQWTIfxQXfcnK04X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dd333160c5efb5:0x3b9852b62e3b2b75<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Wendy and staff are very friendly and caring. They display a loving attitude towards all animals as if they were their own. We lost our dog and she was compassionate and helpful in the process of getting her back home. 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽<//text>

< review>
My dog has been to this place about 4 times unfortunately. The experience was terrible 3 of the 4 times. My dog normally goes to PETSMART in Lakewood to a groomer by the name of Washerie, who understands what a Teddy Bear cut is for a Yorker-Pooh and she follows instructions and he comes back very well groomed when taken to PetSmart. This kanine kabin place just BUZZ CUTS and onto the next dog. We have only been using them with this dog because I'm extremely busy at times and can't get him to his regular groomer. We won't be taking him back anymore. This last cut that WENDY performed on my dog was TERRIBLE! He looked like a banana with ears. And when confronted about the screw up she'd done, she had the nerve to argue. VERY TACKY! Good luck with the BUZZ CUTS!!!!!

I WISH I COULD SHOW A BEFORE AND AFTER!<//review>

Shady business and No point of trying to get new shoes that drops or trying to win a raffle here. These people sells it to the same couple of resellers and back doors the shoes. Was here for the mocha drop an hour 15 before they opened and sold it to the same resellers. We got there around 9:45 and told us they gave out tickets at 9:30. Called a day before and was told to come in at 11. We were told that it was out but we watched them bring more out and sold them. Normal people won’t be able to buy shoes here. You have to have connections and pay them under the table</text>

Lazy as hell staff, cashier even had her leg up while we was trying to pay and anytime I would ask for a sneaker there was an attitude and that’s with two different females.   Never again!!!</Text>

<text>Amazing service. The manager Trevor helped me out to get an exchange of my shoes. They ripped after only a little over a month, I didn't have a receipt but they had my email on file which made it super easy. I definitely will be back soon.</text>< Date>

Sales lady Leilania is a great asset to the company. I was ready to walk out but with her approach and investigation found what I was looking for and made a $100 dollar sale. Next time I'm in I'll be looking for her help. Malia was also polite and helpful .</review>

Ordered a shoe online, went to store to purchase. Got an email notification that my sale was cancelled and had to go back in to get my money back. During all of this the staff was rude and was hesitant to give me money back on my card. Won't be shopping here again.<//review>

(Translated by Google) The prices are normal but the service is good they help one a lot of encouragement.

< Review>
Cold drinks but not worth the high prices, plus you might get attacked by one of the cashier for being right.  The only store in LA the is named with Mexico in it but not one Mexican world in the store, the product has layers of dust on them and the owner is  misogynistic narcissistic obese prick within better than you attitude. If your a female just go ahead and forget it, they do not let you slide for one cents! The side walk in from of the store it's years of filth that blacken the sidewalk less than 10 feet north of the entrance to the store.. Tacos are being sold on a raw $1.25 discriminate price...< /Review>

<review>Farm was fabulous! From the atmosphere - to service and of course the food. The entire experience was amazing. The portions were generous, which I was not expecting. We were so stuffed when left. 🤣 Everything was so yummy! Started with an Amuse Bouche - a very tasty bite. Lobster Bisque. Yum. Sorbet. Ricotta Mushroom Ravioli and Dessert. We shared 4 desserts. 😎 Menu changes. So worth it! 💕</review>< Pics>

We were visiting from Oregon and asked the rental car employee where we should go for breakfast. Without hesitation she said “Farm!” We we’re definitely not disappointed! Very soothing atmosphere in what looks like an old wedding chapel. Daniel our server was on point and the food came out quick and was so fresh! Must experience this place when in Palm Springs.< /text>

<text>If I could give more than 5 Stars, I definitely would. Our experience here was so awesome at breakfast!!! It was so good, we came back for the dinner experience and trust me IT IS WORTH IT. Not only was the experience something different, but the staff was extremely polite, professional and attentive. The food was PERFECTLY balanced and put together beautifully. Our Waiter, Britain ("like the Country"),  was so friendly. Drinks were delicious also! Honestly, can't say enough good things about Farm. In a area where most of the money is made off of the food/drinks, this place did not skip out on details just to make a buck. It was great! Thanks!</text>< Pics>

This place is a little Parisienne Oasis in the Desert. Feels like you were invited to an initimate backyard party at someones hip abode. The outdoor space Cafe style eating area is mostly protected from the harsh sun. The staff is quick with smiles and friendly service. I had the Chicken BLT and it hit the spot. They have an assortment of breakfast fare and judging by the smiles and happy chatter I assume it was more the agreeable to the patrons that day. On the weekends prepare for a wait but a wait that's worth it.<//Review>

Amazing atmosphere in a cozy and romantic patio, complete with live music/singing. We had a wonderful night and the food was top notch. We both had the short rib, crepe was delicious, and the chocolate cake beat us and is for tomorrow. Two thumbs up and now I want to go here for brunch next time I'm in town.</text>

<username>Lisa Morgan< /username><Text>What a beautiful setting to enjoy breakfast and coffee.  Very popular!  We got there at 9am on a Saturday morning and waited almost an hour for a table.  Service was very slow....our waiter was helping out from their other restaurant.  We waited 20 minutes to order coffee, then anothet 30 until we were able to flag him down to place our order....had our food within 5 minutes!!  It was delicious. Really enjoyed and would return!!<//Text><user>114993688186556883065< /user><GmapID>0x80db1ba5b4c5ed93:0x45a109b1119683e2< /GmapID>< Pictures>

The chicken and waffles here are legendary.  I've been hearing about it for years and finally had the opportunity to try it myself.  It did not disappoint!  Beautiful space, fast and friendly service.  Already planning my next visit.<//review>

<review>This cute spot was busy but you wouldn’t have known it with the level of service! We got right in, food and drinks were quick and SO good. Tito was our waiter and he was attentive and kind to our party including our three young children!

Consider yourself lucky if you’re able to get reservations. Food was absolutely amazing! We had dinner and I had the Pan Seared Blue-Nosed Bass and it was perfectly done. I can also recommend the scallops and the ahi tuna salad. Both were great! Excited to try breakfast here next time I’m in Palm Springs. Great experience. Highly recommend.</Review>< Gmap_id>

The taste was so good, and I thanked your chief for preparing it. The place is so wide and classy. The over service was so satisfying. Keep it up! Cheers for your success!<//Text>< pictures>

Lovely place. The outdoor dining style is perfect. The farm-to-stable French country style food is awesome. We love coming here for brunch, so fresh and tasty. Wonderful crepes, the eggs are cooked perfectly, and the waffles piled high with the freshest fruit. Great coffee, too. And they have a great cocktail and wine menu.<//review>

<review>The Farm is a 5 star experience from atmosphere to food to drinks to service.   Can tell this is a well-groomed staff that's trained very well.  We had the breakfast croissant, lox-bagel, banana-dulce de Leche crepes, which were all spectacular.

Key lime martini was delicious!

If you are in Palm Springs, you MUST visit this spot.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNy-5ZjiEe001tYPXKcwbxqIPrxGDzxDXIxzsX5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80db1ba5b4c5ed93:0x45a109b1119683e2<//GmapID></record>

I can guarantee that your boss is one of the best people in our country. We're sure to visit your restaurant again! Very much recommended!<//Review>< Pics>

The food was fantastic, a variety of courses, stater, apitzer/salad, a palet cleaning sorbet, tangy orange sorbet (amazing), main course and desert.  With every course you are offered 4 choices, my wife and I choose different options to sample more.  Excellent food, fresh prepared perfectly, with great ingredients. We were there on a Tuesday night.
Well worth the wait and price.
We will be back...</text>

If you're in Palm Springs, find a way to get to Farm! You either need to make a reservation or be ready to wait but it's worth it. The food was remarkable. We had a strawberry lemon crepe, banana french toast, and the andouille omelette and each was it's own form of perfection. If we ever make it back to town we'll come back here without fail.< /review>

<Review>Only one menu (probably due to covid) but the food was great. Service was good as there was always someone to look after us — the manager, who welcomed and seated us, was keeping us updated as our waitress was finishing off another task . A singer was doing a live performance which really participated in creating a cozy atmosphere.

We ate in the patio and we didn't feel too close to other tables. The decor was nice and enjoyable throughout the dinner.

Minor "complaint": the bread was probably defrost in the oven and it didn't taste like fresh.

Would definitively come back again!!< /Review>< Pictures>

Had lovely dinner, excellent lamb and fish dishes, good wine list, friendly servers and beautiful garden setting. Romantic and quiet with soothing vocalist several rose bushes away.... Came back for early breakfast (line up starts at 8:30am so get in early) and enjoyed a smoked salmon and spinach crepe and yummy migas with chorizo. Star of Palm Springs dining.< /review>

I had the Andouille omelette with spinach and gruyere cheese. It came with roasted potatoes and a fresh soft baked baguette. My mouth was mesmerized! That wasn't even the best part; after watching all the food go past and hit the tables around me, I thought I should have ordered a starter. Luckily, I ordered a bloody mary and it was a meal in itself. It was topped with substantial crispy bacon pieces, serrano peppers, juicy sweet orange slice, lemon, perfectly tart pickle, and a good-looking olive. I'll go again before I leave Palm Springs, next time I will make a reservation even though it was well worth the 50 min wait. Oh and one more thing, the ambiance was peaceful and serene. Beautiful garden, humble home vibes and none-pretentious!<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdwyh2bm8Es7sf6sihsr2nwwwle_XXYWbsDFK1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5AUiv5ZocSUvv4ZDUt5rHb9Pq6r5K3bFpEYkU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGwSQtCa90G8rInGfthuKPXnGlc1nmwlP-Se4I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Ate here once for brunch and the food (ordered sandwiches and crepes) was mediocre, but the wait staff was nice. The owner is extremely rude and arrogant, not easy to work with for corporate or private events. We inquired about a potential group dinner as they had outdoor space, and wish we hadn't wasted our time. Plenty of great restaurants in the area with owners who respect their patrons and are easy to work with. If you believe in using your money to support good causes and kind small business owners, please go elsewhere!</Text>

This place might have special food, but my experience was only with the hostess and the food. I called to place a take out order but they don't take orders over the phone, 😮☹️🤔 but told i need to order online on the website, so I try and I was not able to because they close out online orders at 1pm, so I drive to place, circle around for parking, and get to the hostess desk. I'm told they can't do take out at 1:30pm
(they close at 2pm) and I'm explaining to her but they didn't tell me that on the phone, and if she can please make an exception. She finally decided totake my order and says it will be at least 35 to 45 minutes. I say ok and wait. I get my order and drive back to my hotel, to find my order missing the drinks, dishes are not what I ordered and to make it the WORST possible restaurant experience of my life, they gave me a small thing of vinegar dressing instead of maple syrup for my french toast which I poured over my breakfast and turned it into a soggy sour french mess. That was a $60 breakfast for two people that I ended up throwing away. If anyone can top a worse experience in in any restaurant, i will give you $60 to share it. They will hear from me tomorrow morning when they reopen. I'm going to contact the owners with this. Unacceptable from start to finish. Ruined my day with their side of vinegar.</Review>

Travels to Palm Springs in November for a weekend getaway. Farm is really 4.5 stars - ambiance, service, innovation! The fresh flavors absolutely come through in every bite. I’d eat there weekly if I lived in the area.<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Exceptional in every way. Tables are all generously spaced and guidelines were explained upon our arrival. The ambiance of the outdoor area was incredibly warm and romantic. Menu structure was simply easy to understand. Every single thing that came across our table was perfectly plated and, honestly some of the best mouth pleasure I've experienced in quite some time. Definitely a must do when in Palm Springs.<//review>< Pictures>

This restaurant was great! A friend recommended it. The atmosphere was clean, white, and modern. Our waiter was very helpful in recommending something my daughter may like as she had trouble deciding. Service was good, and our food came quickly. Two thumbs up for us! We will definitely come back!<//Text>

Like the menu, presentation. Eggs Benedict was just OK. 3 star. Coffee served in the press for$ 6.00, a buttery French roast, 5 star. The savory Complete Crepe, a 4. Not exciting. The grilled chicken sandwich 4.5 star. Great ambiance, service, fair price.</text>

Farm was absolutely delicious! The service was excellent while still being socially distanced and outdoors. Being at Farm is a bit magical as the outdoor garden is a bit of green in the otherwise desert landscape. The menu is prix fixe with limited, locally sourced options. Everything we had was wonderful but check the menu before you go as it changes every week.<//review>

<Text>This is a cute French restaurant that has outdoor seating. When eating here, you feel like you’re eating in a small French village. I ordered the croissant sandwich which was delicious. The croissant sandwich comes with greens on the side. Great service. No reservation needed during the day. When we arrived we didn’t have to wait for a table but we went there one early Tuesday morning (around 9 or 9:30).< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>Amazing meal. Absolut attention to every detail. Every course was flavorful and complex.  My wife had the Red Baby Yams and Apple Soup,  Prime New York Steak and Givre for dessert. I had the Crispy Calamari Steak, Poached Herb Salmon With Black Mussels and Salted Caramel Molten Cake.<//Review>< gmapID>

As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to disrupt our lives, we tried Farm's take out option.  A real winner! The food was fantastic, a little bit on the heavy side, but really fresh and delicious. What really is phenomenal is the service.  Paying is a little burdensome, but the delivery is perfect.  Very friendly driver, and perfectly packaged food.  It made our night perfect.  Thank you to the Farm's staff.  Looking forward to the time when we will be able to join you for dinner at your beautiful restaurant. For now, we will continue to do take-out!</review>

<Time>1612243143432< /Time><rate>2</rate><text>I've always loved The Farm for lunch - the ambiance, the menu, the preparation, the servers.  However, they are not always consistent and today was one of those not-so-good days to introduce it to a new guest.  My Bacon & Cheese French Toast was actually tough, dry and barely warm.  It looked shriveled and unappealing on the plate.  A bit of a sad embarrassment.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Had a great dinner here last week. The ambiance on the patio was perfect. Light levels just right and tables spaced appropriately. The server was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about all the food and the owners’ story, and that made it more special. All the food was fresh and delicious. We will be back.</Review>

I was able to book a last minute reservation at Farm online. So glad I did. We had dinner here and everything was amazing. The service,ambiance and food. I am not a person that likes desserts or sweets but the lemon meringue I had for dessert was one of the best desserts I've had. I love that the dinner menu is changed every week. The outside seating is very romantic and special. I will be coming back to Farm when I am in Palm Springs again.<//Review>

Delicious!! Farm offers fresh fresh fresh food. The garden dining area is absolutely gorgeous. I wanted to move in. Herbs, roses, bougainvillea, morning glory vines, all growing and thriving all around. The music is soft and very Parisienne. I loved the cloth napkins and miss matched glassware spoke to my inner French bohemian. The coffee was yummy and iced to perfection. My favorite was the bacon. They get it by the slab and slice it themselves. It is uncured and the flavor is insane. I'm single so this bacon was the best part of my trip lol. I mean I don't even need romance if I can eat that bacon every day.. the staff was so friendly and honestly Farm will be my go to when in Palm Springs. Don't miss this restaurant!<//Text>

So delicious. The ingredients were top quality, and the food came out shockingly fast.

Best omelette I've ever had!

Gluten free options incl a good toast. Our server was knowledgeable and everyone was following good sanitizing standards during COVID.</text>

Very romantic, beautifully lit, open-air courtyard with ivy-covered walls. Food was amazing. Each course was delicious and an example of excellent craftsmanship. Our waitress was very friendly and knew the menu well. Unfortunately the busboys were a little slow and forgot to bring our drinks at three different occasions. She talked to them and service improved afterwards. We were enjoying the night very much. It was a great experience.<//review>

<text>Enjoyed the atmosphere! Lovely patio area. Very hot even with misters on we arrived for breakfast. My husband enjoyed his breakfast. My vegan sandwich was inedible due to toast being hard as a rock. The waiter was very nice and removed it from our tab. I will definitely try this place again to give a fair review.< /text>< rate>

<text>Wow. Food was amazing. I did not know it's a place where they give you a menu to choose an appetizer, entree, and dessert for one price. This night it was 57 a person so dinner ended up being around 200 with drinks and tip 😬. But it was worth it imo for a special night. The ambiance was romantic and lovely!</text></record>

<Text>Bienvenue! An extraordinary French vibe and cuisine in the heart of Palm Springs. This family owned restaurant offers great Southern French breakfast and lunch that your palate will enjoy. No wonder it’s very popular among locals/tourists. It’s located in a huge plaza overlooking the mountain. We were warmly greeted by the hostess and escorted us to our table. You can feel the ubiquity of southern France atmosphere as you step inside the barn door. We were seated at the center of the outdoor patio restaurant right next to a wooden chandelier. They have contactless menu and free Wifi (pwd is croquemadame). We ordered a French Press and Veggie omelette (avocado, mushrooms, onions and arugula) served with oven roasted potatoes and baguette. It was very flavorful and tasty. Similarly, their coffee was great. Service was moderately fast. Staff were amiable and obsequious. Prices were fair and matched the serving. Overall, I had a good bday breakfast celebration and we highly recommend the Farm!</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1fZ0etWDEKckLqVqtUnENLql9tzm0FQbDSemW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8afN_EdV1vVjkSlSawuq-2FPngufglVaA3lqS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6SJy5AZCzBft9YQjALJ2rXgfohuFaHJ-9hiCi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdr5mLKpGBr5GSSxTuO-l_iXnfhX7NxtXsuRHO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMagWILbTZMwpv9JI7Zq8q3_6k9lTNkJIXdwrjL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrDu4aCNJReHltb5jr-9bMzWw86vtln_Znb-6j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<text>AMAZING! The best brunch I’ve ever had! This place is the whole package. The ambiance cannot be beat, you sit in a garden while French music fills your ears! What is not to love? The food is amazing as well, a celebration for your tastebuds. The chicken and waffles is the best though. If you have a chance, definitely stop in here while in Palm Springs I promise you won’t regret it!</text>< pictures>

<text>I had been here many Farm ago, and found it quite nice for a couple.  I had always wanted to try lunch, but never had the opportunity, as there is a Farm in San Marino, which I frequent more.  My favorites are the eggplant for a healthy dish, as well as any of their egg rolls, which are huge, compared to other restaurants.  I really like having the choice of either brown or white rice, as I often try to eat a lower glycemic option when having Chinese food.  My husband says this restaurant is more Westernized, but I guest I enjoy western tastes.  Overall, a nice dining experience, although we had to eat in the bar, as there was private party at the time of our visit.< /text></record>

<text>The food and service is incredible. I don’t think we waited even 5 minutes for the food to arrive after ordering - so fast AND everything was fresh.  You don’t typically get both.

Highly recommend the chicken and waffles, strawberry banana crepe w/ nutella and the omelet with duck confit and brie.</text><user_id>104558132559084854067< /user_id>< pics>

Our waitress recommend the Corn Flake Crusted French Toast to start and it was amazing! I got the huevos rancheros which were so good too. We got the bottomless mimosas and you can interchange your bottomless drinks! We were celebrating a friend's birthday and they brought a complimentary slice of chocolate cake.< /Text>

<Text>We found this place on Yelp and were super excited to try it. I checked the reviews and info and they make it sounded like there were many vegan options.

The customer service was great. In the brief time we were there everyone was very wonderful.

The disappointment came when there were no vegan options. The waiter made it clear it’s a French restaurant so there is butter in everything. I just wish they represented themselves more accurately online.

So, now ya know - They do not have vegan options.</Text><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

Yikes. The best thing going for this place is the location and setting in central PS in a pretty courtyard. But the food and service leave a lot to be desired. And French? Not at all.

Steak ordered medium rare and without mushrooms arrived well done, with mushrooms, 1 of which was rotten/inedible. Grilled salmon was essentially seared/raw (unclear how intentional this was but it looked and tasted terrible), sent back, next version same thing.

Server was not familiar with how the food was prepared. Manager was helpful and tried to improve the experience but to no avail. Maybe an "off night" but you have to wonder how such poorly cooked and executed food can slip through if manager/chef are paying attention at all.< /text>

<text>One of the best deals you’ll find. $55 for two huge portions (appetizer and entree) with two small tastes on either side, and a tasty dessert left my friend and me more than satisfied. Service was excellent, if perhaps a bit too formal for the laidback outdoor dining.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user>

Best dining experience of my life. Amazing five course meal and incredible service, but most of all was the atmosphere. Relaxed, but elegant and romantic. Lighting, mist and fans, foliage/flowers and mood lighting in a smaller alley like setting make it feel straight out of movie.

My wife and I spent our first anniversary here on labor day weekend, and I literally could not have asked for anything better. If you're on the fence but have the money,do yourself a favor and just go. Make a reservation, and make it a special night to remember. We will absolutely be back.</text>

<Time>1606328711964</Time><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>A better name for this restaurant would be RUDE!  We were walking downtown Palm Springs last night and saw an a-frame for Farm on the corner.

We went to eat dinner there at about 6:30 when we were rudely told by the woman at the door that they are reservation only.

Funny thing, we watched others go in before us and they did not have reservations.

Not sure if we were being discriminated against or if they really truly are reservation only, but if you are a reservation only restaurant, don’t put an a-frame on the corner soliciting business.

If you were just discriminating, f-you!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80db1ba5b4c5ed93:0x45a109b1119683e2</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

A farm house in the middle of Palm Canyons Drive, interesting concept and tastefully decorated interior, you really feel like dinning in a farm house. Lunch was served very quickly, we were seated 30min before they closed at 2pm, and our lunch were arrived within 10 min after we ordered. Services was friendly and food is reasonable (a little bit on the pricey side). Overall it was a good lunch.<//text>

<review>Big portions, but super yummy food! Staff is friendly and very accommodating. We went during a rainy day and were told the wait would be 40 minutes due to the back up. A lot of the seating is outdoors so half of the area was wet. But they let us explore the cafe while we waited, and we actually only had to wait about 20 minutes!

All the utensils and cups were different which added to the quaint atmosphere! It was a great experience!< /review><Gmap_id>0x80db1ba5b4c5ed93:0x45a109b1119683e2</Gmap_id><user_name>With Chelle</user_name><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXgedr8WaFWEtr48wOcA2qGCdPf6LsKKzIVYDb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhwsSge2pP4gNSOm4AZokjSVjCnH8P-3s4BRZ6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOD0XzmSgCg4j7jun2ckKyFUdAxj9fRErXz2gBW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

One of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time! Service was great...covid style,  but very professional. Everyone was pleasant and happy to be of service. Food was amazing! Quick to come out of the kitchen, everything done well, flavorful and delicious. Croque Madame and chicken and waffles are two things to try! I wish everyone made it like they did. Thumbs up to this restaurant and their delightful staff!</Text>

Everything was absolutely delicious! I would definitely recommend and definitely come back for more. The vegan burger was on point for sure. Probably the best I’ve ever had. The strawberry Nutella crepe was great! Egg and chorizo migas was also delicious. And the blood Mary was on point!<//text>

<text>We ate at the Farm several times during previous visits to Palm Springs, last one being in early 2019 and loved the food. Unfortunately, two bites into the dinner appetizer, we were wondering what had happened. Maybe a new chef? (Apparently, yes.) Some of the dishes were bland, some were ok. Not bad but nothing sensational - and definitely not up to expectations based on previous experiences. The staff was very friendly and attentive, which is the only reason why the Farm gets four stars but we won't be returning anytime soon.</text>< pics>

From the very start the two nice hostesses that greeted us and took us to our table till we left and they said goodbye everything was perfect. The service was impeccable all the way through. Menu is great and food was fantastic and all of the fair price. We loved all the house infused cocktails.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Review>This is a beautiful, secluded little restaurant hidden from the main strip. Walking in here feels like being transported to Europe. The atmosphere is relaxed, cozy, romantic. They're primarily open for breakfast and lunch, but they do dinner on Friday and Saturday. I can't speak for the dinner, but the breakfast was to die for. Absolutely superb.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6J69ByBXAMuwDcbb5YOKFIKAL6eY6smtCbNv4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwomoW3FTz-0QhzYAc5DKsFyukPI-yntvF9OMC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Absolutely fantastic. There are a few things to nitpick about like the unnatural green color of the key lime pie, or that the mashed potatoes needed more butter or cream. However, everything was excellent. The salad, the steak the key lime pie cocktail and the key lime pie itself too. The wait staff was incredibly nice and helpful. The owners came by and spoke with us, and they were very accommodating. I would recommend this place to anyone coming to Palm Springs.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkJcJiMM74ZQkpBS4sXNU_xE3l-DBSB_cmjY9_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWDqK5qpIE5GDvXD4d0ZbzFw5h_ZEWChDlMb6T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1rY8dvaPHWd6KMIvL_IgCMe-AFUtZyHGOuxEF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0g_QhqZ4TzaNNM2hCSH5g82iqhR5dW6V4p-DY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLTzzGoo0OL4LlAqj6ZVdTqGXoEjb8ckodlxmp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMBi_lUzBEmGpkNokqHwPHwQXA984_wEqsJhoN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdFsKcEkpm83VZDzTWK4Tf9cNyV_ok511gHnOa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2s2jB7kEQz8dzctB7mx8wDAhvoLWw2ZhO42rV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9KSsxjlXcKIQz-xyH4F5scS0a2oWnjEAxPYe1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

The best experience ever!!!! I have been to a lot of nice restaurants but this was insane.  The service is perfect.  It felt like family.  Everyone was nice and helpful.  The atmosphere feels like you are not in the USA.  It is so quaint and romantic.  The food is sooooooo delicious.  We had the best time here.  I would go back a million times.

You MUST go!!!!!!<//text>

<Text>Even though the temperature was still 100 degrees at 7:30 pm, the patio was pleasant with misters and greenery. Service was excellent, and every dish on the prix fixe dinner menu was delicious. The Hemingway's Heartbreak cocktail was refreshing also. I highly recommend this restaurant.< /Text></record>

Beautiful atmosphere. Prefix menu sounded delicious then was underwhelming... Yellow curry and mussels was not served as listed on menu and instead was mussels in a wine sauce, steak was tender but chimichurri sauce was over salted, and cocktail needed to be sent back as it was not prepared according to menu.</review>

This is one bougie brunch I've had in my life lol! Four stars because I did not know one mimosa costed $30-50 correct me if I am wrong. The meal came out too $100-200 I wasn't expecting that either. I came here because my friend had recommended me that this place was good but I honestly think it was mediocre from all the other brunch places I have tried out. Maybe it was because the price disappointed me. It might be nice to take pictures here because at least the environment is pretty here. Definitely your Instagram worthy spot. Friendly staff too just this place is way too expensive for a brunch for mediocre brunch . I think this place is good for one time special event kind of meal. I doubt I will be coming back here but definitely check it out! Gonna admit their whole outdoor seating is definitely gorgeous and greet for picture so that is the only pro about this spot! Very aesthetic!< /Review>

Their phone: "thank you for calling farm... Blah blah blah press 2 to speak with a host"
Me: *presses 2*
Their phone: "thank you for calling farm. Blah blah blah press 2 to speak with a host"
Off their rocker if they think I'll drive across the city to place an order in person and sit in a parking lot for 20 min when their phone system is crazy.<//review>

The atmosphere and ambiance is blissful. And the food speaks for itself... absolutely delicious! If you are in the area (I was visiting) be sure to stop by - Farm is worth going out of your way for.</text>

Absolutely outstanding experience as I begged for help to deliver an amazing meal to my quarantined dad on his birthday.  The food was beautiful when it arrived and the manager personally delivered it.  My heart goes out to all restaurant workers and owners during this time and the stress they are all under.  To go above and beyond in this way was such a gift, and a true testament to the quality of people Farm employ.  Bravo to all!< /Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Place has a wait for a reason, and it’s worth it. It’s in a cute little place that looks like it was previously a nice home. We ordered the croissant egg sandwich and it was enough to share. So flavorful and fresh. Side of toast with date jam was amazing. It was very busy so they weren’t great about water refills, but other than that service was great.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>It was ok I understand with COVID19 things are alot different for business and you are probably running with different wait staff and servers, but a little training wouldn't go amiss. 3 of us had the Dinner Prix Fixe on a Friday night, all the apps were great. The entree Filet's were cooked to perfection, the Chicken Cordon Bleu was an absolute joke and a disaster (that alone should be 0 stars). The chef obviously had no confidence in cooking chicken as it was cut on the served plate therefore dry by the time it was received. Poor really..... dessert was ok, have seen similar in grocery stores - is it homemade?<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJPOJ-C0XEMASE-I15eRC5BzLqzXDd6bhI0LU_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJe02N8Y-om00gCnzoI80sHuDNoFAMvZ_94l9L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHMrtHkAGHPl8yQIeLh7M-u-l7vxRJ8Acj3tf8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuNRbKA3lb1LELOUNuQu2tz4-rVeqRCifaXVuh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPCGGtRyaX7bPQj7qM9h72-CJthSZFXOGL1DPy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVAS26sUo45iYMdWd88QRoaX42u5vSqICtmVot=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpxkruJeNpX7EV_dmQCwHnh8ZksDuqZDGSBRAB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZQEBxTeZghSDP-AFg5NV3CHFw94XBWLrg1-Fs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

This place is super cute and the food is great. We don’t typically go to the same place multiple times when traveling, but went here each of our 3 days for breakfast. Had the farm breakfast sandwich, croissant sandwich, Spanish Migas, croque madame, and chicken & waffles. Everything was delicious. Coffee and watermelon mimosas also great.< /Text>

One real vegan type of option but being a French restaurant it would be unreasonable to ask for more.

Food and mixed drinks are incredible. Social distancing, text comes when your table is ready, staff is always cleaning, the mist and hanging greenery keeps you cool and cozy in triple digit heat and you scan the menu on your phone.

They are tip top with preventive health measure. Service is great. I loved that the cutlery and glasses were all different, like it was someone's home.

Pricing is high.</Review>

The ambiance of this place in Palm Springs is unbeatable! You eat French-inspired food in the French-inspired garden. The food is very fresh and well cooked. Wine is good with French selections available although somewhat pricey. The only negatives for us was absence of kids' menu and that there are only 2 little bathrooms on the property (lines form). Despite absence of kid-sized portions, no food was left behind! For desert, we ordered a sweet crepe with strawberries and chocolate.</Text>< user>

<review>The waiting time is very bad, hostess tell you 30min, but wait time in almost 2hours. Manager was not interested at all, people were sitting chatting after the bill was paid and manager did not explain he needs to turn the table! Very disappointing!</review>< Pics>

Funky upscale breakfast and lunch. The chicken, bacon, and waffles was delicious. The iced tea was different, in a good way. The server was hard to find. Every plate that passed my table, made me second guess my selection. No regrets, just not enough time to enjoy everything!<//Text>

<review>Outdoor seating is beautiful, and very rustic. Food was okay, a little under seasoned in my opinion. Would go again and try something different.< /review>< Pics>

<time>1606930527557< /time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>The best meal I’ve had in a really long time. We did their dinner experience. I loved the set price, with the options. Apparently they change weekly! If we lived here, we’re be coming regularly! For the appetizer, I got the beet salad with arugula and goat cheese. Soooo good. My husband got he smoked salmon and he raves about it. For our entrees, we both ordered the steak. It was thick! And cooked to absolute perfection. Every side (porcini mushroom, twice baked potato, broccolini) was perfect. Good portions, amazing flavor. Fantastic service. For dessert, I had the apple cranberry pie and my husband had the pumpkin cheesecake. The sizes were perfect. We had leftover steak and potatoes that we brought home. The ambiance. The music. Such a wonderful place. I highly recommend!!
And to the owners, this dinner experience is TOO CHEAP!!! You and your staff deserve more for that experience. $56 per person is undercharging. We would have been happy to pay double. No joke.< /Review>< Pics>

Amazing! Came on a Monday morning around 10am - no wait, but packed! Ate outside under an umbrella... about 100 degrees! But the food? Omg... the food made up for the heat! Had the smoked salmon & goat cheese omelet and a lemon & sugar crepe... perfecto👌🏾.< /Text>

One of the best breakfast places in town. Replenishing and refined. Simple yet satisfying to the 100th degree. Warm and wonderful staff. A must to visit if you're in town.< /review>

Unfortunately larger parties are substantially debilitating for the novice hostess staff. Our party of 7 was promised a time of 35 minutes before being seated. After 65 minutes, and constant check-ins, no seat. We were finally seated after 70+ minutes of waiting and a conversation with the manager. No discount, no apology. Would never recommend to anyone. Find a nearby restaurant for better service.</review>

<text>We recently went here for breakfast and a must to order is the banana fosters French toast = perfection! So delicious, not too sweet, and cooked perfectly. I wished I lived closer just so I could visit again and order the French toast. The bacon was crispy and tasty and I enjoyed my meal. The hubby's waffle was yummy too!

The ambiance and decor was a very cute vintage style and they offer indoor and outdoor seating. We went on a Monday at 1130am so there were plenty of open tables but I've heard that the weekends are ridiculously packed, so plan accordingly.

I would highly recommend this place and look forward to my next visit!< /text>< username>

This was the third time we have been to The Farm and it has been amazing everytime.  The food is always good, there really isn't much you can do with breakfast but its always fresh and yummy.  The fact that some how they make you feel like you are really on a farm is really cute, well done guys.  I love all the little touches with the pictures of the farm animals to rustic (non-matchey) furniture to the trained humming bird (see my photo) that stopped by our table. Food is part of the experience we (Me and Rob) enjoy of course, but it's the whole dining out process, service and the setting complete it.  The Farm has is figured out, Jerry Ayala ( Who is from our hometown too Orange) is great!! Hope to see you all real soon.<//Review>

Amazing delicious fresh food in what looks to me to be a French garden setting. So glad we discovered this place. Coffee is expensive but they bring you your own personal French press.</text>

< review>
Ok here we go last night was a success .
Presentation: I walked in to a very clean and cozy spot
Server : Crystal was amazing , running around like a chicken without a  head attending to our every need and ask  ( all alone we were a party of 15) had a big smile on her face and not once did she mess up on our order kept asking if we needed anything .
Cook : Jay took the time to come outside  to our table and tell us what was good on the menu apparently the chicken Posole and meatloaf were a hit .
Taste and quality on food :
Chicken Posole : great taste ! Authentic Mexican taste not to strong or plan on spices , the color was dark green how it's supposed to be and able to taste the different chiles , the texture  of the chicken was perfect .
Wagyu burger : meat was perfect ( medium rare ) just how I like it super juicy .
Fries : fat fries maybe could use a little more season salt .
Ranch dressing : home made delicious
Chicken Parmesan  : chicken was moist but not really flavorful not a fan or would  I recommend .
In general definitely 5 st< /review>

Awesome and way better than some places with a long wait. Very cute decor and even better food. Go right when it opens at 9am to be seated right away. Croissant breakfast sandwich and the omelettes were our favorite. Get a crepe for the table to share!</Review>

This place has a nice patio and friendly (but slow) staff. Except for the bread itself, the rest of the food was disappointing. Chicken sandwich = very little flavor. Salmon crepe was very salty. Not recommended for the food, just for the ambiance.<//Review>

We were in PS for 4 days and ate breakfast here for two of them. So Delicious! You must try the Chicken n Waffles. So different from the norm! The french press coffee was a bonus!  Such a cute place nestled back in an off st. Courtyard.
Cheers!< /Review>

My family and I enjoyed our brunch at Farm!  It is a little difficult to find from the main road.  There isn’t a lot of parking nearby but it is a fun area to explore.  I suggest finding a parking spot and then walking to the restaurant because it is easier to find on foot. They had a great banana french toast with hazelnuts.  I enjoyed the watermelon lemonade and my mom loved the savory mushroom crepe.  These crepes looked darker than the typical white flour crepe.  I think they may be made from buckwheat flour which is a bit healthier.  The outdoor seating is very pretty and filled with flowers.<//text>

Great brunch place open for dinner only on weekends. Great location downtown on La Plaza just off the Palm Canyon. The location is in kind of a courtyard and has a nice French countryside atmosphere with many tables outdoors. Really good food and service. They do not take reservations and you should expect a wait. Stop in to put your name on the list and go shop or get a coffee nearby. They will text when your table is ready.</review>

This place is great from the amazing courtyard, to the staff and the food. If you are looking for a cute place to have a brunch this is it. There is a nice variety of unique food and drinks. If you can, try it on a weekday as this place is busy come the weekend. They don't take reservations so if you're going in peak brunch hours plan to wait a bit.<//Text>

<Text>The atmosphere is charming, relaxed and intimate. Servers are attentive without being annoying. The menu changes every week as it is created based on locally sourced and fresh  ingredients. It was the best Chilean Sea Bass I've ever had! Can't wait to try them for brunch! They serve dinner on Fridays and Saturdays only.< /Text>< pictures>

Hands down, the best in Palm Springs. Was a must go for brunch , and now dinner to. Slow relaxing easy going and delicious. Ambience was fantastic, the lighting, decor, and singers. Food was a 5 course feast of perfection. I attached a photo of the heavenly prociuto and watermelon salad. The menu changes nightly to make sure its perfect.<//Text>

We were really looking forward to this cute European styled breakfast spot. The patio and ambiance were brilliant, the breakfast left a bit to be desired. We ordered a French press, eggs Benedict, and croque madame. We would not order any of them again based on this experience. We’ll have to give it a second try at a later time.<//review>

I got the bacon, chicken, & waffle dish and it was very unique and good. All the tastes together were something different, yet very well executed. The server was great and the patio is beautiful. The only downside was that 2 of us got the potatoes instead of the mixed greens salad and was charged a $2 up-charge each. We were not told this when ordering, so just wish they would have let us know beforehand.<//Review><resp>None<//resp>< Rating>

Farm is an adorable hidden gem...french inspired decor and food. The food is delish and the patio is so inviting and I love that coffee is served in a french press. It's a romantic little place to grab breakfast/brunch. They also have a prix fixe dinner (reso required) on Fri-Sat evening. They do not take reservations for breakfast/brunch and you can expect an hour wait for a table on the weekend but it's totally worth it!</text>

<review>Beautiful outdoor space and very good service as well as live music. The way the staff had to move around the chalk board menus is a little weird. The set 5 course meal had good options. The salmon main course being served on the night we went was amazing but the hanger steak wasn’t very tender and under seasoned. The table next to us had to cover their steak in extra pepper. Would still return to give the daily changing menu another shot though.< /review>< Pics>

A daydream setting gives this restaurant a delightful atmosphere. We were served quickly and the food was fresh, delicious, and unique. I had the chicken and waffles which was unlike any other chicken and waffles I have ever eaten -- so much flavor and a fun twist on a classic comfort food. Also, they aren't joking when they say they have the best bloody Mary in town!< /Review>

I am so sorry to give only 3 stars to this beautiful restaurant because I really wanted to love it. The location, ambience and decor are amazing. The drinks are unique and great. All the people working there are so friendly, smiling and helpful. Our problem was the food. I had great expectations after reading the reviews, visiting the website and recommendations. I tried the cantaloupe soup and unfortunately I found small pieces of parchment paper in it. My chicken was over cooked and the beef goulash was kind of ok. Presentation  is fine but they need to go for the wow factor. With so many excellent restaurants in town (including same owner's amazing Tac/Quila) I dont think Im coming back to the Farm.< /text>

<text>One of the best in the region
Farm Restaurant in Palm Springs is like a slice of European countryside, plopped in the center of town. With it's charming patio just of La Plaza, you would never know that you were in a city.
We've eaten there several times now and every meal was a joy. The young staff is very friendly and professional and the owner makes a point of making diners feel welcome.
The food at Fam is also excellent. We've taken a number of friends there, and all have loved it. It really is consistently great and has quickly become our go-to place in town for a delicious meal and friendly atmosphere.<//text>< pics>

I ordered the Canard Omelette for breakfast and it was excellent! I always like duck and this omelette has the duck confit in it so I had to try it and it was GREAT! I never imagined that duck confit can be part of a breakfast item and they nailed it. On top of that the staffs were great.  Highly recommended.< /Review>

<review>Very quaint restaurant with beautiful courtyard and outdoor bar. Service was poor in that my soup was lukewarm and my sandwich order was served with the incorrect bread. The mushroom soup is fantastic. The hostess was rude and because we arrived 45 minutes before their lunch service closed, we were advised to have our lunch order ready for the waiter. Come on! Is this how you treat customers?< /review>< pics>

I had heard rave reviews about Farm and they did NOT disappoint! Staff were pleasant and friendly from the moment I was seated. My experience was during COVID policies and so everyone was seated outdoors.  My visit was around 1030am on a weekday morning but the desert sun was already steaming things up! The restaurant provided hand fans to use during your visit. This helped! I noticed while ordering (via their QR code reader menu), that they had one staff rounding the restaurant wiping down tables,  chairs, and high touch areas.  The decor had a French flair while maintaining a rustic chic overall vibe.  My waitress was very attentive and the food was divine! My food arrived quickly. I ordered a cross crossaint sandwich with roasted potatoes.  The crossaint was so buttery,  light,  and flaky! It was a delicious meal.  I will definitely come back!<//Review></record>

Farm is fabulous. Just had an excellent breakfast here at Farm. The food is fresh and tasty. It's obvious quality ingredients are used which makes the food stand on its own. We had the chicken and waffles and the crossiant sandwich. Another bonus is the excellent coffee and to top it of the garden setting is beautiful. Yummy!</review>

Slice of France in Palm Springs, with the hour wait and very quaint seating inside<//text>

<Text>I’m sitting here writing this review, this place is absolutely amazing, Sarah our server was spot on with her recommendations everyone needs to try the chicken and waffle, this is not your regular breakfast it’s the best breakfast you will have in Palm Springs. Forget the cost it doesn’t matter here it’s worth every penny. As for the place itself it’s just beautiful from the mismatch china to the beautiful tiles. It’s so French. We will be back in the morning for sure.< /Text>< Pictures>

Where most of the people there were friendly the service I received was rushed and less than responsive. I asked for a simple breakfast of coffee and a waffle and was told waffles were only with the chicken and waffles or on the side . I said I will pay for the meal but I only want the waffle. What I got was under cooked chicken and almost a corner of a very small waffle that was cold. The coffee was also cool. After asking for the check and paying in cash the change took longer to get than the meal and it was short. I guess coin is rounded down.
All in all it was not a nice experience and I lived here. Maybe being from Pioneertown and not looking the part of a tourist makes a difference. As an organic farm and ranch owner I think this is not the best place to go.
I will be happy to cook real organic grown food for them just to taste the difference< /Text>

<Text>We did their multi course weekend dinner and it was lovely! They also had a variety of cocktails that were great as mocktails. It was definitely meant to be a culinary experience and priced as such at $56 a person, so this is NOT your bargain meal, but if you're looking for something special and more of an experience, this is a great option. It's also worth noting that it's meant to be a slow meal, it takes well over an hour and offers a wonderful ambiance.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80db1ba5b4c5ed93:0x45a109b1119683e2</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Awesome,  eclectic atmosphere and decor. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu,  even going above and beyond to ask about possible allergens  (there is no flour in the Bacon, Chicken and Waffles gravy, so this GF girl could have a bite of the chicken!) The Canard omelette was amazing and the individual french press coffee a nice touch.  A little spendy for breakfast,  but worth every penny.  A hidden gem in La Plaza well worth the visit!  We were able to walk in and be seated right away on a Tuesday,  but reservations might be a good idea on the weekend.</review>

Great little place for breakfast.  The restaurant give a warm country rustic vibe.  There are also seating outside which just like eating in your back your but with a service.  The food is excellent.  The coffee is really good.  The servers are attentive.  I really enjoy my breakfast there.<//Text>

Let me start with the food quality. It is perfect. Amazingly fresh and high quality produce combined deliciously makes this an amazing place to fill your stomach. Farm also has friendly service and a great atmosphere. I would have given 5 stars but the service, although kind, is slow. If time isn't an issue for you, I would highly recommend Farm.</Review>

Very nice setting & good service. Unfortunately their signature French dish ‘Croq Madame’ was a soggy mess, under cooked & lacking in crunch. Our chicken salad was better with tasty fresh ingredients. This restaurant appears in a lot of the free Palm Springs magazines so beware the advertorial & don’t get your hopes up.<//Text>

<user_name>Dann Paane</user_name><Time>1580597770706<//Time><rate>5</rate><Text>This modest-looking place is nestled in a quiet niche off the busy main street (of Palm Springs) with dining areas both indoor and outdoor. The latter is made more comfortable with sun umbrellas dotting the cosy and clean courtyard, a pleasant reminder of the dining ambience typical of those popular tourist spots in Europe. The menu features a rich variety of items with local flavors, plus a colorful inventory of drinks,  which fit well for decent brunch or even casual dinner. Together, the elegant setting, affordable prices, and friendly services make this place a worthy hangout for visitors as well as locals.< /Text>< pics>

My friend and I read in a hotel magazine about Farm. Thus, decided to have breakfast today. I never thought I would find such a charming and cozy restaurant in downtown Palm Springs! I had strawberry crepes, orange juice and a wonderful cup of coffee. Everything was exquisite and our service very attentive and pleasant. I can't wait to go back!!</review>

<Text>Food was amazing. Staff was nice and attentive. Great options on the menu. Make sure you have time, this place can get very popular and wait times for tables can get long. Will definitely be back on the next trip to Palm Springs.<//Text>< Time>

Found it by talking to a local on the street. Said it was the best breakfast in town. We were not disappointed, food is amazing in a quaint garden atmosphere.  French music playing in the background adds to the ambience.  This is a must if you are in the area.<//Review>

Great little french place! Cool decor and friendly staff.

I got the savory salmon crepe and boo got the duck salad. I really enjoyed mine but the salad would've been better if the duck was a sliced breast (not on the bone). Nevertheless, everything was delicious and we look forward to going back for the prix fixe dinner :)<//text>

<Text>Locals will already know about the farm but for those of you who don't this is a must for lunch or dinner. The food is incredible and creative . The staff is clearly trained by somebody great because they are knowledgeable happy and efficient. Try their bloody Mary. You will be shocked at how good it is and where else can you get a bloody Mary with bacon in it. Also try the chicken and waffles..  it's a very dog friendly environment  Tucked away in a very intimate setting. Absolutely a must see and a must visit<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEu5VSyCkBv6TtLqtZKYxqVo1JbfuQ7PDzXD_e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYRtc2cTedQnncbMJ0urNVW60VMaxTj8aLqcT8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Such a beautiful rustic French country inspired restaurant (design) the food is so Farm to table style, looks like real food not prepaid or batched up like chain restaurants look like. New favorite when in town 💕<//Review>

Amazing indoor—outdoor spot in the middle of the tourist area downtown, between See’s candy and Bill’s Pizza, this hidden spot is well known by locals, judging by the crowd I encountered at 11 am on a Tuesday. There was a wait to sit outside, which I can understand, it is a lovely Spanish courtyard, but sitting inside is in the high  ceilinged White adored walled room with the fireplace, you will not feel ill seated.

— • Service  • — Was as lovely as the setting and on par with the quality of the food! I was in the service industry 30 years, I don’t say that lightly.

— • Food • — I had chicken and waffle, made from scratch, topped with bacon and some type of sweet white chocolate sauce. It was one of the best renditions I’ve seen or eaten. And I watch me some Diners, Drive-in’s and Dives too! But actually, this might be a little to beautiful for that show to ever feature, but they do show a lot of Chicken and Waffles! My dad a Citron Crepe.

— • Prices • — ..................................$$ — $$$

Bacon, Chicken and Waffles...........$16
• grilled chicken, sausage, waffle, bacon 🥓 with sweet french sauce •                            ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Citron Crepe.....................................$7
• lemon crepe that comes a single starter, but a delicious desert option I’d think. anyway, it’s what my dad had, I can’t give it a fair rating because I didn’t taste it. but from my experience, it was at least a four •                                              ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Coffee ................................................$ )4 or 5?
• it was expensive but well worth it. big french press of great coffee, nice service too. but a good 24 oz  of the good stuff, I’m a one cup man at best. hated to waste that good coffee! •                 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

— • Overall  • —

Love my first visit. Dinner is a Chefs choice, priced at $52. I never even considered spending that much on a meal per person, but I’m sure this would be a place I would try.

No worries, plenty of options in the $10 to 16 range for breakfast and lunch I need to try.... It’s hard to imagine not ordering the chicken and waffle again though! It was that good. 😁

<Text>I really really want to give a five! It was the best food we had in Palm Springs. The service and atmosphere on the patio were perfect. Unfortunately, the hostess was just very unfriendly. It really seemed like we were interrupting her internet time. Not a smile was cracked.

My on caveat is that the chocolate mousse was not traditional French recipe and was way too sweet with a bizarre white center.  I would absolutely love to go there again.<//review>< Pictures>

Beautiful spot, the ambience is exceptional. I loved the chandeliers outside. Food was great, coffee could have been a bit better, but the Bloody Mary came with a great garnish!< /review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>They offer online reservations BUT don’t actually take them for morning or afternoon sittings — the times when they are most often open.  Very inconsiderate especially when you’re on open table and the only message tells u to try another day, which u will do many times to no avail. Yet their chalkboard at the restaurant tells you they don’t take reservations — how helpful is that?<//Text>< pictures>

<review>There are so few farm to table restaurants in the Palm Springs area we were reluctant to try one but had absolutely no regrets after going to FARM. The food quality was top notch and I HIGHLY recommend this place. It is in a sleepy but very quaint little strip mall. Parking is challenging but the food makes up for this. EVERYTHING we had was perfect including the service. Thank you FARM for being available to people looking for a healthy alternative.< /review>< Rating>

<Text>We went this past weekend with a group of 7. We sat on the patio (wish they had fans, but that's our fault for sitting outside in Palm Springs in May). It was shaded, so that was nice! The wait was 45 minutes around 10:00 AM on a Saturday - so not too bad. The hostesses were really nice. We all liked our food, but our drinks ended up not coming until after we were done eating. We did put our food & drink order in at the same time, but I've never been to a restaurant in my life where the bar doesn't work faster than the kitchen. This obviously put our server in an uncomfortable position too, since we were clearly annoyed. We had to ask for the drinks to be comped, so they took 20% our check. I was happy they tried to fix the situation, but I would have preferred the discount was just offered or drinks comped instead of having to ask for it. Clearly no customer ever wants an entire meal to go by THEN be served their drink. Other than that, the food was good & our waiter was nice.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Came so highly recommended but was terrible. The wait was so much longer than the stuff told us and then they forgot about us. Food was very crudely prepared - farm boy cooking not a professional chef.< /Review></record>

<Text>While attending an alarm convention in May I stopped for lunch. You have the option of sitting outside or inside. They sat me in an excellent Booth where I enjoyed chicken salad sandwich. Everything is homemade from fresh ingredients. I would highly recommend eating here. The cost is slightly higher than I would expect for this type of restaurant but overall it's a good meal.</Text><Response>None</Response><rate>5< /rate>< Gmap_id>

It's a very cute garden atmosphere. The server in charge of water was on top of it. My water never even got to halfway. The server in charge of our food order was helpful about answering questions.
I got the smoked salmon, goat cheese, and spinach omelette. It was absolutely stuffed with smoked salmon. The goat cheese was inconsistent. I would have liked more goat cheese. I was not a fan of the raw spinach in the omelette. I would have preferred it cooked a bit. I really liked the omelette once I took out most of the spinach.
The side salad was mixed greens with (I think) some vinaigrette. The omelette also came with a big piece of a very tasty baguette.
After we finished our meal and our plates were removed, it took a while to get our bill. Or perhaps time just went slower in the heat.<//review>

It is the hidden gem of PS! Food and atmosphere is wonderful! We ordered a mushroom crepe, berry French toast and an egg dish to share. Very bite as better than the one before! The French country interior was inviting. I will be having breakfast here everyday until I have to leave! Not to be missed.<//Review>

A little small gem that is a wonderful place to have meal with friends and family. We really enjoy the fresh salad and tasty bacon, chicken, and waffle.

The decor is also very unique with an old farm house style through out.</text>

Love this place. We live in the valley but had never been to the farm. I got the wild mushroom omelet. It has yummy. I also ordered a cup of coffee and they brought the small French Press with espresso in it. That was really good two. Would definitely recommend the farm.< /Text>

During our stay in Palm springs, me and my bf had breakfast here every day. We love the restaurant's French vibe and its patio.
We had Spanish migas, French toast, crepe, croque madame. Everything tastes great.
Every tourist should have breakfast here at least once while they're here. Highly recommended. 😍</text>

Wow. Best breakfast of our trip. We sat on the patio with the feel of an amazing French countryside brunch spot. We loved the food, the service, the plates and glasses, and the fact they allowed our pups on the patio was just the cherry on top of the whole experience.< /review>

Best waffle I've ever had in my entire life! (chicken and waffles) Very nice staff, awesome coffee and atmosphere. Next time I'm in CA I will come for dinner. It came with a side salad and the chicken was not fried, might not sound good at first but it was way better than some greasy fried chicken!< /text>

< Review>
The farm transports you into a countryside indoor outdoor setting, greeting you with its charm and decor. Mismatched place settings add to that flavor. Even if you are not granted indoor tables, shade, fans, and hand powered fans keeps you cool.

The food is more French inspired than truly French as the baguette, a marker of the kitchen's adherence to quality was disappointing. There was no inspired crunch followed by a chewy doughy delight. (See omelet picture)

That being said, the ambience lends itself to feeling good as you eat a rustic American breakfast under gentle shade. Yes the Cobb salad was good, and avocado portions generous.</Review>

I’ve heard a lot of great things about FARM so I was really excited to finally try it! The food was excellent - I ordered the eggs benedict with crab. However, their cold brew was really weak, and their coffee wasn’t too great either. Service was average but the staff were friendly. I’ll definitely come back another time and try a new dish!<//text>

I was really enticed by all of the pictures of this restaurant and the reviews on Yelp, but beyond the decor, that's where the goodness stops. The food was utterly tasteless (we got the egg croissant sandwich and the chicken crepe). My local bakery shop is far superior and a quarter of the price. The food deserves one to two stars max, and I would say the restaurant environment deserves about four to five stars. I would consider other restaurants in the area before eating here.</Review>

We went to dinner. Service was excellent, they were accommodating for kids needs.

The problem was, the chicken I ordered was seriously undercooked. I skipped the red parts of the meat but regardless I was seriously sick that night. I should I have just sent the plate back. I don't know what I was thinking.<//Text>

<Review>Chicken bacon and waffles is a must. Also the French Press coffee is excellent! If you sit outside hummingbirds might come eat from the flowers at your table...

We had excellent, friendly service and a good choice of traditional Estonian food. The Kitchen is in a glass enclosure in the middle of the restaurant - so you can see your food being prepared!! Pricing on med to high side (particularly the wine list) but well worth it.< /review>

The chicken sausage waffles
Were pretty good, I liked the sweetness of the waffles with the meat. The orange juice tasted pretty fresh, but not as good as other French cafes I have been to.< /text>

<Review>Delicious prix fixe meal ($52/p) in a charming setting on La Plaza served with great care and attention to detail. The menu changes all the time and the choices--appetizer, entree, and dessert--are chef-inspired. An amuse bouche and a palate cleanser are also part of the meal. A lovely way to dine.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>If Jesus existed and created a breakfast place...this would be it. The Chicken & Waffles will literally haunt your dreams (in a good way). Service is great, people are friendly, mimosas good and the environment is really quaint. I want to come back and check out dinner! If it is anything like breakfast then I’ll probably be taking weekly trips here just to eat. 5 stars! Keep up the great work!<//review>< time>

Very surprised this place has such positive reviews. Went here for brunch last weekend and ordered a veggie omelette. The kitchen completely messed up the order, and the waiter seemed very confused at our request to fix it. Finally the manager came over, was very rude, and returned our food with 1/2 an order of our side potatoes. When we finally ate it, the omelette was bland, I was not impressed. Needless to say, with the awful customer service and average food, I will not be returning.<//Text>

It's taken me several tries to actually dine here, I never plan ahead to get a reservation when I visit Palm Springs. The place is really geared towards breakfast and dinner, I don't recommend for lunch. The food is good made with fresh ingredients, fun little workhouse converted to a restaurant and friendly staff.<//review>

Cozy breakfast place with enticing, eclectic, and somewhat unusual menu.

The service was excellent even at a time when they were busy enough that we waited over a half-hour to be seated.  I hear that Farm is nearly always busy.< /review>

<review>Very cute restaurant for brunch! Plenty of outdoor seating so it’s perfect for a nice day. I loved the vibe and food. They had amazing crepes that are perfect for sharing (recommend banana strawberry Nutella). I had the breakfast sandwich which is very filling, definitely can split with another person</review>< user_id>

Is a high ranking for what I'm going to say and in some ways you'd be right.  I went there for the first time in and ordered the goat cheese,spinach with wild mushrooms omelette. It would have been over-the-top delicious if it had not been for the raw egg in some of the bites  I had. It was even suggested that it was melted cheese, but I do know the difference. While the wait staff is very friendly it was kind of hard to get extra water. I spent the evening very ill and could only attributed to raw eggs.< /text>< pics>

For that intimate farm chic brunch experience look no further, Farm is exactly where you want to be. Excellent service! The food is fresh and fantastic! It's is a hidden gem in the La Plaza shopping strip. They now have a booth to text your phone when a table is ready. They are located between Raw Remedy and the Delicatessen.< /Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>We were so happy to find this little-hidden gem in Palm Springs.
The restaurant is lovely & romantic. You can eat outside with some small lights and we had a live concert of two amazing singers (well done, you were amazing girls).

The atmosphere was romantic and peaceful. The managers (a couple) came to see each table and wish them a nice evening. The food was really good, the service was great, the waitresses were perfect.

Thanks

From two French girls<//text>< Time>

This may have been the fanciest meal I've ever had, and the flavors were mind-blowing, but what really made it special was how perfect the service was. They were so personable and fun, while also not bothering us unnecessarily, and taking care of dishes/drinks without being noticable. Seriously probably the best service ever!< /Review>

<Text>European atmosphere with mostly outdoor seating. The rustic french decor makes you feel like you’re sitting in the countryside of a small European village.
Liz is very accommodating and eager to please all her customers, Tim is a gracious server with meticulous attention to detail. Food was fabulous. There might be a wait, but so worth it.< /Text>< gmap_id>

portioned and tasty. Spanish Migas was the table favorite; looking forward to trying their dinner. Noting, it wasn’t our favorite breakfast ever, and I wouldn’t wait an hour and half for it. But, they do a sms based call back system for their line, which made it accessible with a low commitment, and the ambiance made a great start to our Sunday morning.< /Review>< pics>

The chicken and waffles here was once one of the best plates of food I've ever eaten.  I've had it multiple times, but the last time I was here the chicken was undercooked so I had to take a star off-_-. However, farm is incredibly classy and has great service and took the plate off the bill.  Bonus points for having a hummingbird greet us at our table!  Highly recommend the price fixe dinner menu on Saturday nights!</text>

<review>I worked as management in the restaurant industry for years. We were visiting Palm Springs, and Farm was highly rated as a breakfast place. Upon arrival, there was a large sign declaring,  "Please wait to be seated." We did. And waited. And waited. Finally, I went back into the establishment to try and find someone. I saw a few patrons, but no staff. My travel companions and I left. I then called the restaurant, and was connected to the hostess. I informed her of what happened, and rather than apologize, she insisted it was because the hostess stand is SO far away from the table seating. I told her she should let the management know of the situation to prevent it in the future, and told her goodbye. I was stunned she was making excuses, instead of recognizing that she lost customers.< /review>< Date>

Upscale traditional French cuisine at a very affordable price.  If you're going for dinner, make reservations. If you're going for breakfast or lunch, plan to wait for table since they don't take daytime reservations.  Personal recommendation: get the chicken and waffles. And get an extra waffle on the side. You won't regret it.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80db1ba5b4c5ed93:0x45a109b1119683e2</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This place is okay for down here. Cute decor, lovely floral plantings in the courtyard area. Food was bland and unremarkable. Nothing bad, but entirely mass-commodity style ingredients. Nothing noted as fresh, local, or organic. Totally conventional and uninspiring. Whatever.<//Review>

Very good food! I admit, I was a bit put off by the ambiance - seemed very hipster and chique. But insider was very calming and simple design.
The food was the best part! Again, I was expecting fancy small plates, but it was big and delicious! Got Eggs Benedict and an omelette with mushrooms, both were amazing and TRULY tasted fresh from the farm!
Make sure to come early - we for there right when it opened and we still had to wait 20 minutes. Definitely worth it if you are very hungry and enjoy brunch.<//text>

From the moment we walked in, we were transported to another place. The ambiance on the garden patio was amazing and every dish we order was perfectly cooked and delivered with the utmost attention to detail. I do not think we could have dreamed of a better spot. On top of everything, the owners, Liz and Mark, personal came to every table and greeted each guest as though they were old friends.  My wife and I were given a complementary glasses of champagne for our special night and the singer sang our wedding song, to which we danced right there beside our table. I don’t often leave reviews but wanted to share this magical experience with the world, in hope that FARM is able to provide the same joy to others as they did for us.<//text>< name>

<text>Food was good, service was great! Large party so we had to sit outside, and it was pretty hot. I mean we are in palm springs at 1200 so we knew  it was going to be warm! Wait for 10 people at 11 was one hour<//text>< pics>

<response>None<//response><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>We stopped here for lunch because the reviews were so stellar, and we saw why! This cozy spot is tucked away just off the road (making it a little tricky to spot if you are driving by), but once you go past the host station, you are greeted by a beautiful, lush outdoor seating area. The ambiance was top notch!

The food was equally exciting. My omelette was perfectly prepared and quite satisfying, and my dining companion’s sandwich was delicious. All told, this is a great brunch/lunch spot!< /Review><user_name>Mike Hill< /user_name><Pics>None</Pics></record>

<text>I love this place. Esp. when the weather is beautiful like tonight. Tried to get one with David, but he is camera shy. Its cozy enough for a romantic dinner for 2 or for friends night out of 10. The landscaping is amazing. Those ladies have a talent. Please tag yourself, idk their names. They also host a Bible study every Wednesday, which is really cool< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

< Review>
The ambiance in this restaurant is fantastic. The seating is a bit strange in that some of the tables are tall with chairs that leave you chest height to the table, and others the opposite. But the food matches the ambiance, so likely the seating is on purpose so you don't linger all day.<//Review>

<text>Wonderful experience at FARM. We were quoted 45min wait and ended up being no more than 20min (which gave us just enough time to check out the neighbouring shops). Great ambience in the backyard gardens. We ordered Grilled Chicken and Waffles, Migas and a side of roasted potatoes. Everything was fast, fresh and delicious. Tons of flavour and each dish was very unique. Watermelon mimosa and caesars were fantastic! The service was great as well (from ordering to check ins, to water refills and settling up). Friendly, efficient and well organized staff added to wonderful experience. Will definitely be back!<//text><date>1551624145946< /date>< UserId.>

<Text>Brought mom here for mother's day breakfast and it was disappointing. The food was good, but the service was terrible. The dishes all beat the drinks to the table. The server never came back. We had to grab random employees every time we needed anything. There's was more but why list it all? And then to finish it off, they run your credit card at the table and hover over you as you enter the tip on their little tablet. So tacky.< /Text><Date>1557710527515</Date>< Rating>

Found this cute gem this morning for breakfast.  Tucked away behind one of the main shopping drags, this little bistro seems miles away from Palm Springs.  Great food, friendly service, the French Press coffee was excellent.  Will definitely try this place again.< /Text>

An absolute must place to go in Palm Springs. It is right off the main drag but its secluded setting transports you out of the city and into a lovely farmhouse setting. Breakfast here is a must and reservations are encouraged. You can always put your name on the list and they will text you when your table is ready so you can wonder around town.

If you are there on select days don't miss the dinner. It's a fixed menu with a wonderful presentation. Sit back and enjoy a lovely meal just don't forget to make a reservation in advance.</Text>

If you're looking for a great breakfast/brunch/lunch spot, Farm has a superb and simple menu that more than satisfies. The ambience is also excellent with a lot of kitschy elements.< /review>

Best polenta dish I've had in my life (the Spanish breakfast). Such a great restaurant, so full of character and whimsical decor. We got there at 8:15AM on a Sunday, still had to wait for 45 minutes, but it was still worth it.<//Review>

<Text>They were packed inside so we sat outside with heaters. I was annoyed and cold,  but started to warm up after the food came.  I had a croque madame, which was ok and it came with plain greens and a clear vinaigrette.  The other party had a crepe with the same boring salad.  We had the pressed coffee. First pot was lukewarm but second was better.  They did take off the price of the first one,  but our breakfast,  cost $50, with tax and tip, for 2 people.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>My family loved this place when we had a lunch there. The place is off the road in downtown PS so it felt secluded while we were actually right DT. The place was tastefully decorated. The service was excellent and the food was really good. Definitely will go again next time we are in PS.<//Text>< date>

Open air dining area was beautifully rustic and ecclectic. Meal was in the top 3 meals I've ever had (mushroom ravioli). The musicians they had singing set the perfect tone without being too loud. They told us the table was ours all night, so no rush to get through our 5 courses. It made for an incredibly romantic evening.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

There are several separate rooms and nooks and crannies inside and out so the setting feels more intimate than the total number of tables would suggest.  They do have a bit of an odd seating policy.  I waited 45 minutes despite several tables being open because, I was told, the kitchen is too small to run at capacity.  Assuming that is in fact true, I would recommend simply telling guests that and giving them the option to sit and have some drinks with the understanding they may need to wait a bit for food service.</text>< pictures>

Once seated, we waited for at least 20 minutes for wait staff but none appeared, despite the table next to us getting service (and refills on drinks).

Worst dining experience in Palm Springs.  Went there for breakfast.  They seated us outside in the sun with flies buzzing around.  We asked for another table inside and were placed at a worn out metal cafe table.  The service was spotty.  We had to ask for water twice and we wound up "borrowing" silverware and napkins from an adjacent table.  The food was awful.  Waffles were cold, tasteless, and we had to ask for butter and syrup.  The toasted breakfast sandwich was served on a plate that appeared to just exit the dishwasher.  It was full of water and saturated the toast.  So much so that the sandwich fell apart when I picked it up.  The bloody mary was so laced with tobasco it was undrinkable.  Why people rate this place highly is beyond me.  We won't ever go back.  So many less expensive places with much better food and service.<//Text>

<Review>Weird little lunch spot in downtown PS. The quality of food wasn't bad, but it's somewhat pricey and the seating was uncomfortable. I don't know if there was no AC or if it was just not keeping up with the heat, but the interior felt uncomfortable swampy.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Wow! From the moment we met Liz the owner at the hostess stand, we knew this would be a unique experience. She greeted us with genuine warmth and walked us back to select our perfect spot to enjoy the evening from. The live music was alluring - the fire pit, so cozy. Every element of the aesthetic so perfectly curated - it truly is a transport to something magical in the south of France.

Sarah took exceptional care of us all evening, perfectly present though never hovering, she anticipated our needs before we had them.

Then the food! Wow! Exquisite, unique, bursting with flavor, satisfying though never heavy, each bite was perfect.

We’ll definitely be back!</Review>< response>

I ordered breakfast croissant and it was extremely disappointing. It tasted quite plain, no flavor, my local bagel shops have much better taste than this restaurants and only cost $5 rather than $16 from this restaurant.</review>

Fun exploring and discovering wonderful little places like The Farm in Palm Springs. Highly recommend if you are ever in the area.
You must try the Bacon, Chicken Waffle.  It's to die for good.<//Review>

Don't know if the wait is that long on a regular weekend but during the Coachella weekend it can be 45min or so. Great outdoor seating, great mimosas, great breakfast options.<//Review>

< Review>
This restaurant has thoughtfully prepared food. It's organic & tastes exceptional. I am disappointed in the negative reviews. In this fast paced world, I think some people can't handle a restaurant that actually starts cooking high quality food AFTER you order it. The menu states as such, so it shouldn't be a problem. I will for sure return to Farm!<//Review>

We spotted this place for lunch. Our table was next to a fireplace for added ambience and gave a soft glow to the room. The taste was excellent, it was like a foodgasm in my mouth that can only be described as a river of ecstasy flowing down my spine.</review>

The restaurant is tucked away at the back corner of the plaza, but a great experience once you find it. The farmhouse decor was actually quite elegant and tastefully done. You can enjoy your meal in the nice outdoor covered patio or opt for indoor seating. The food was delicious; probably the best brunch place in Palm Springs.<//text>

We waited about 40 minutes for a table. Once seated service was pretty attentive, except the food took a long time to come. I ordered the poulet a la creme crepe. It was a little disappointing after such a long wait...kind of bland and flavorless.  Got the citron crepe for dessert, and that was fantastic. The best lemon crepe I've had outside of France! So at least it finished on a high note.</review>

<rating>3</rating><Text>This is a beautiful restaurant. Gorgeous ambiance, flowers, lighting. They have delicious food (prefix, 5 course for $52 - amouse bouche, appetizer/salad, palate cleanser sorbet, entree and dessert). The owners stopped by our table and were so lovely, they truly care about their guests. The live music was by an amazing woman who sings backup for The Eagles when on tour. However... we arrived at 7PM and left at 10:30PM. We were happy to be together with our group, but we waited so long for drinks from our waitress. She never stopped by our table to see if we needed anything, never really spoke to us and when she did she was “fake” and clearly not happy to be helping us, we never saw her unless she was delivering food, asked for bread during salad course and received it during dessert. Wish the service matched the quality of food, ambiance, entertainment and owner appreciation. Go here, but prep for a long evening and order more drinks at once so you don’t have to wait ;)</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

This restaurant which was recommended by our sommelier at Le Vallauris was just a gem.  They have a beautiful courtyard and charming decor.  The service was attentive without being intrusive despite how busy they were.

The omelettes were outstanding and likely one could serve two as the portions were generous in fact I had my other half for dinner.  They do not scrimp in the ingredients and the omelettes were soft set and perfectly cooked.  I'm a big fan of French omelettes so this omelette was silky and creamy, not rubbery and browned as you so often find in other places.

I ordered a croissant and they served it charred and wow - what great flavor it imparted and the texture was still flakey, buttery and still lusciously soft!

We ordered a French press while waiting for breakfast and it was a great start to our meal.

If you want a great breakfast or brunch while in the area, you won't go wrong here!</Review>

The table is YOURS!
First time there - running late - called to apologize & told, “please relax, take your time, the table is yours for the night..”, which, after enjoying the perfect food and hearing the ethereally beautiful live singing becomes very important because you don’t want to leave. This was a one of a kind restaurant experience for me.< /text>

Can't beat this French style brunch.  Give yourself permission to relax and enjoy your meal with great friends.  And don't forget to order the champagne with a splash of cranberry.< /Text>

<Text>Had dinner here last night and had a really nice time.  The $54 per head prix fixe presumably reflects the owners’ target demographic and it was populated accordingly - with an older and more sophisticated crowd than many PS venues.   We had the oysters and grilled octopus appetizers and the vegetable curry and Coq Au Vin Entrees, followed by crepes and sorbet deserts.  Although the octopus lacked flavor, both the curry and the chicken were excellent, as were the crepes.   We added a delicious and reasonably priced ($40) bottle of Rose.
The venue (we sat outside even though it was 40 deg) is really pretty and reflects the South of France vibe they are going for.   Our server (Leah) was great and the discreet live music (Amber) was an added treat - beautiful voice with unusually confident restraint.
Definitely worth a visit.< /Text><resp>None</resp><userid>104084239258047112455</userid>< Pics>

This was a unique restaurant that was recommended to me from friends in Riverside. If we are able to drive an hour and wait another half hour to get our food but then be completely and utterly satisfied afterwards,  I'd say that's a good meal. I couldn't have asked more from this gem of Palm Springs.< /Review>

The mango dulce de Leche crepe was verya good so was the croissant sandwich.  The Farm sandwich was tasteless.

I also loved their coffee.< /Review>

I got the a la banane, which is French toast with sauteed bananas and mascarpone. The flavor was okay but it was lacking in the sweetness you'd typically find in French toast. Disappointing.
My brother got the chicken and mushroom crepe, and he and I were most disappointed by the fish, as it lacked flavor. The most flavorful part of this dish was the mushrooms, and even those were the least flavorful mushrooms I've ever tasted.
Some redeeming qualities of this establishment was it's unique ambience, and the kind and interesting staff. We felt like we really were at a farm in Paris. We were impressed by the silverware, which was actually from France--the knives had Little metal bees on them. Cute.</review>

Don't be fooled by the hostess wearing athletic gear, nothing here is fast. On the menu they even say "nothing is rushed around here" and they're not kidding: over an hour from sitting down to getting food. Maybe they could reconsider, hire a couple more people and get food out in a reasonable time, and save the passive aggressive menu comments. Also nowhere to change a baby. Food was pretty good when it finally came, although chili flakes in the hollandaise sauce were unwelcome.</review>

< Review>
We put our name in and wwere ok to wait 20 minutes as we walked the paseo in the beautiful sunshine. Got a text to make our way back in about 10 minutes...great....waited as a few other groups were seated, then they called Jim and someone who had just put their name down chimed in James! We noted ourselves as Jim and the hostess said I’ll take you both, she proceeded to go back,  stopped at a beautiful table in the garden in the sun, sat the other couple, then took us back to a two top right on the rail to the kitchen...yuck!!! When we commented that we should have been sat first she just looked at us with a blank face and walked away...We left, really...ths is how you orchestra the beginning of a dining experience? As locals who are trying the restaurants in town,  this was a very bad first impression.< /Review>

The food is usually great, I'll give it that.  But the servers are rude and unaccomodating. It takes forever to get your food even when you're the only people there.< /Text>

The food was incredible, the surroundings charming in the extreme, and the service impeccable and impatient. We were taken care of and accommodated at every turn by Sarah and the fabulous kitchen staff during our late lunch.

We had a number of great dishes, but particularly recommend the Croque Madame, the savory crepes, and a side of bacon.

The Mama Needs a Drink and the Jalisco Mule we’re both nice, and the Negroni was perfectly made, but at $40 a bottle, the Provençal Rosé was the jam.

For ten people, we spent $490. That includes countless cocktails, two bottles of wine, one glass of wine, a dish each, and a 25% tip.

Visit Farm at your earliest convenience.<//Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Absurd. No reservations for lunch or breakfast, then told reason you can't be seated at the half-dozen empty tables is wait-list. So wait half-hour to sit where no one is sitting for half-hour. Hostess attitude is "Don't bother ever coming here." So we never will.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>We came here for the first time and it was pre fixe dinner. The dinner experience was so amazing.... the food, service and ambiance were incredible. The outdoor dining area was so cute and romantic. We loved everything we had that night. And the baked Brie was a must have!!!! It was so good, we went back the next morning to have breakfast and order it again. The cocktails are also done so well, not just pretty but very yummy!!!! I would come back to Palm Springs to just come here for dinner again. Could not be happier for the overall experience.< /Text><GmapID>0x80db1ba5b4c5ed93:0x45a109b1119683e2< /GmapID><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8KrGpdwHYsgR8OZdtpQCa8p2dE-2taaV610vL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQBt45EvfuyA1ttC5SbSXBQrzbNyRmQPBUXjR5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPV892SkIeHlRe5_DBLHxVHqhtVPfMwyyQ70MHI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnR06T0VfG9tphfW12mWbiB1582GfPqK70oG2G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbH1BqLz05_Xpz9vo3FUsTivPDi3JCOhXvJ689=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFUOq5B5yWh--IUJ4IFxvMZ7mkK-tjFtYcddz1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVnn6FANCmF5OmTLRGDk6HIGMTwA91CkAVRqAd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO26iyasT6SY9hxeKsdjEsChsXGu-yMMgaTc9Sw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYSeulE8n4HpO4ntHUWXKDK1e1ItSK2i21T97_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZ9oafr29Q9_0hv0CXZ496g9rS4LIK3gXbjP2-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< rate>

(Translated by Google) Kind and delicious :^)
The most delicious brunch!
However, Bloody Mary was a little difficult.

친절하고 맛있다:^)
가장 맛있는 브런치!
다만, 블러디 메리는 좀 힘들었다.< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Comfortable environment friendly staff, great!
There are indoor and outdoor seats. Beautiful and elegant outdoor seats are recommended. The quaint wooden table is very comfortable.
We came for breakfast, and the choices were very rich. The people of Biyazhou ate a lot and were slightly salty.
The toilet in the bathroom is not very friendly and the wall is too close.

(Original)
舒适的环境友好的员工，很棒！
有室内座位和室外座位，推荐美丽优雅的室外座位，古朴的木质桌子很舒服。
我们来用早餐的，选择很丰富，比亚州人吃的量大，稍微咸了点儿。
卫生间的坐便器不太友好，贴墙太近了。</review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Very nice place to go for breakfast or lunch. A little away from the street, surrounded by flowers, it's like being in the garden on a summer's day. The berries with red berries and the eggs with florentine were excellent. I strongly advise

(Original)
Très sympathique endroit pour aller prendre son petit déjeuner ou déjeuner. Un peu a l'écart de la rue, entouré de fleurs, on se croirait dans son jardin un jour d'été. Le pain perdu aux fruits rouges et les œufs à la florentine étaient excellents. Je conseille vivement< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) But a little high, so-so delicious, the atmosphere is good. If you live singer bill also contains, reasonable or.

少々高いが、まあまあ美味しくて、雰囲気が良い。ライブシンガー代も含んでると思えば、妥当か。<//Text><Rate>4</Rate>< Time>
