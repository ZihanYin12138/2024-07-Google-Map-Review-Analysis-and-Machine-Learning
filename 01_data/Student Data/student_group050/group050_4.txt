Very quick, efficient service.  I received a discount since an auto body repair service referred me.  I’ve used Enterprise for over 30 years, they are my preferred car rental company.< /review>

Not much I can say about this place cause I got here to drop off the vehicle and the keys in the drop box that was convenient. Very nice new looking facility. Had a nice area for the kids to play a bit and catch dang lizards.</Review>

<Text>Very quick and easy process. Got what i needed and staff was very nice. Saw a customer get mad at rates and get very rude making comments about staffs pay and other subjects. Staff remained very professional and didnt let it get to them. Was very impressed with how they handled the situation. Sucks that people will take out their problems on others for no reason.</Text>< pictures>

< review>
Employees are very nice here. The vehicle on the other hand didn't give me the best first impression. The vehicle was very dirty inside and out. It was washed and given to me soaking wet to drive off in. There was a noticeable amount of dirt along the window seals and dash board, even after it was cleaned inside. The kicker was when I reached under the drivers seat to adjust my seat position, and had grabbed a dirty sock! Later i discovered some trash under the drivers seat as well. Very disappointed. If it weren't for my busy schedule and the rental being comp'd by the insurance company, i definitely would have drove back and went somewhere else.</review>

I have been to other locations in Southern California with no issue renting a car by using a major credit card along with my debit card and a $400 deposit. The manager here Jimmy was very rude not accommodating at all I truly believe that he was racially profiling me because I’m black and refused to allow me to rent the car stating that it is policy here in Southern California at enterprise  which I know for a fact is a bald face lie!!!! I truly hope he reaps his karma what a piece of work!!!!  He gave me attitude from the minute I walked through the door both he and the brunette were very detached and made sure I knew I was not welcome there.

<review>I had the most disappointing experience after renting with Enterprise Ynez twice before. The problem started from the beginning:

I made a reservation over a week prior to Spring vacation for a premium class 7 passenger vehicle. When I arrived the day of pickup they didn't have anything available in that size, and I was basically pressed into getting a Jaguar F-Pace as we were meant to leave for San Francisco that day. The only alternative was a Ford Flex, which would be impossible to drive and park comfortably in San Francisco. They thought that if they throw a Jaguar my way I will be happy. I drive a Q5, and the difference between the two is ONE luggage, same class, same comfort.

Sadly I had no choice as our vacation was for 12 days, and I was going up the coast and back through Yosemite with 2 children, myself and my husband, our dog and her crate.

I tried to stay an extra day and was promised by a supervisor that they would reach out to swap me out. No one ever did, but conveniently on my way out of town that evening I saw 3 Chevy Tahoes that were parked in their lot, conveniently unrented but somehow unavailable despite my reservation.

We spent our vacation rammed in a car that was clearly too small, and not what I needed. Then to add insult to injury upon returning the car, they tried to make me pay twice by claiming there wasn't a card on file. Funny enough all it took for them to retract themselves was a screenshot from my bank showing the charge on April 2nd, and a subsequent extra two days on April 12th. By miracle they were able to find the card on file which was previously missing...eh...then instead of being upfront that I had extra time left since I went into the weekly tier, they conveniently took the car without notifying me I could have kept it for an extra two days.

When I got back and reviewed my bill line by line, and reached out I was met with being hung up on when requesting a supervisor, and then unable to connect thereafter. What a disappointing use of nearly 1k, and what a disappointing experience of a return customer, who will now look for a different car rental company.

The reality is that every time I was there I noticed they have no rhyme and reason to their process and will often upgrade, downgrade and swap cars for their customers without any regard to reservations, or customer service.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Date>

We reserved a SUV about 2 months ago.   Three days before we were to leave we were informed that we needed to leave the day before our rental reservation stated.  I called Enterprise and was easily able to change the pickup date.  When we actually picked up the vehicle we were informed that they didn't have the size we needed.  Without missing a beat, Matt gave us an incredible upgrade, without the charge.  Stefanie actually took me out and let me pick the car.  Both Matt and Stefanie were so nice, professional and ready to help.  When I returned the car, Alex did out checkout.  He made it super easy.  Matt, Stefanie, and Alex made our family vacation a huge success.  Thank you so much.  We will be back to rent again!!!!!<//review>

< Review>
This place, though busy on Mondays, was very nice. They were courteous and fast enough to get me out of there.

Returning the car was super easy too. My only concern is them giving me a Nissan Kick when I had reserved a small SUV (Rav4 etc). Nissan Kick is not even an SUV ... it is a regular car with some extra head space.

Other than that, this is a good place to rent cars. Highly recommended.<//Review>

<review>Love coming here when I need to rent a truck but there is just one guy that ALWAYS gives me a hard time every time I come in. I still gave this location 5 stars because I don’t believe one person should ruin their score when everyone else is amazing! (Especially the manager and area manager who by the way are amazing and always make my renting experience wonderful!!! I always try to get them to help me) I understand that as an assistant manager you are trying to save the company money by keeping loss down by asking “what do you need the truck for” every single time I come in. (And not in a curious way but in a rude inconvenience way ) or even overselling your insurance, even though i tell you EVERY SINGLE TIME i do not get the insurance. I rent almost every other weekend and you still seem not know who I am or you act like you’ve never seen me before. I understand that I’m young and maybe it’s suspicious for you why I rent so often. But I promise you my credit cards are good and my driving record is impeccable! I want to thank the area manager who was there to help me when all that went down. Maybe I’m being a little dramatic. But seriously? You’ve probably seen me a dozen times since you started there and you still question me like I’m criminal. Lol ok rant over. Thanks to everyone else for always being amazing!< /review>< Gmap_id>

Cars need to be cleaner and the windshield in side needs to be cleaned.  The last two cars I've rented the car was dirty and the windshield was so bad I couldn't see out of it.  I had to clean it myself.  The car was great for my trip to Arizona.<//Text>

<user_name>Courtney Grimshaw<//user_name><user_id>113761262223952230673</user_id><review>This place has prestigious customer service & it is always a pleasure to do business here. I've never 'personally' rented a car through them for myself, but I've been included within rentals that my parents purchased on a few different occasions within the last 7 years, the most recent being yesterday.

They will send someone over to pick you up and take you to their office if you need a ride. They did that yesterday for my mom and I and we had a lot of luggage and bags with us. I was honestly prepared to stay behind and wait with all of our stuff while my mom gets the rental car, then have her come get me after, thinking the car might be too small & with limited storage.

Well, the car they came in was a Dodge Caravan, so I was pleased seeing them pull up, thinking it should all fit. As I walked up to the car with a suitcase, the man that came to pick us up (Chris), pushed these buttons that opened up all the doors & back of the van, simultaneously! & let me tell you - that van had SO much storage, it was ridiculous! Not to mention, it was the COOLEST car I've ever been inside! It was like a space ship or airplane. I remember jokingly asking my mom if it was the one she was renting...

Well, when my mom was doing all the signing and stuff, the man asked if she wanted anyone else to be added on the list to drive the car, it was no extra charge and all they needed was my driver's license. Then as he looks into what car to hand over to us &, after a few seconds, says "Well, do you actually want the car we came in?" He figured since we already had our stuff inside of it and cause we OBVIOUSLY liked it, that it would work out perfectly. Well, it was a quick "YES!" I was really stoked he did that!

It was such a very pleasant experience that my mom and I had with Enterprise Rent-a-Car yesterday, that that's why I wanted to come give them this glowing review & 5 star rating 🤗👍🏻

From out of town traveling through,  when the check engine light came on and almost shutdown our truck, the dealership needed it longer than we could wait, as we had to be 300+ miles away meeting family. They were a bit concerned that we didn't have a local addresss. Even though I explained the situation. The price was good, they picked me up at the dealership. Through walk through, but almost deleted my coupon code. We caught it and added it back on. Effecient and quick return. Overall good experience.<//review>< Pictures>

Had zero problems with enterprise at various locations until arriving at Sacramento airport...I was in process of relocating to the area and due to high travel expenses and moving costs my debit card was all I had to process payment at the time of pick up. Agent stated they needed return flight information in order to rent the vehicle with a debit card. Result was I booked a bogus flight with my debit card to provide return flight details and drive to my new home. Very silly policy that is easily circumvented. What exactly is the point of that policy? Returned car to the original more “local” location to my new home, they even provided a ride back to my house. Overall, pleased with my experience but unfortunately unable to give 5stars based on the debit card policy.< /Text>

<Text>I have rented vehicles at this particular Enterprise Rent-A-Car monthly for some time now and I'd like to share my rental experiences with you.
This is an establishment with superior, top notch customer service!!! The manager, Kevin, is a master of daily operation.  Kevin's team members are equally the best of the best when it comes to professionalism and exceptional customer service.
Even when they are super busy and may lack a full staff, those who are present provide their utmost with courtesy and friendliness and respect to myself and other consumers.
It should be no wonder then, that I return to this Enterprise time and time again.
I am happy to provide my review of this great place of commerce and congratulate each and every staff member on such an outstanding job every day.
I send my many thanks to you all.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>The service was awesome. Very speedy and professional. They didn't keep me waiting, had all paperwork ready to go and took me out to a very well kept, clean car to use for our weekend needs. When returning it, they were equally as efficient and friendly. This was such a smooth easy process and I'll make sure to let anyone know if a rental car is needed in Temecula where to go.< /Review>< Pictures>

Got bounced around electronic options (press 1...) just to end up having the phone ring a few times and a robot woman say “goodbye”, and hang up on me. Frustrating. Why can’t businesses just answer the phone? Couldn’t even talk to anyone to ask my question. Renting a van today and lacking info about the process. Here I am sitting writing a negative review instead of getting the van and getting on with my day.

... Just called back, asked my question to a live person, got put on hold for 5 minutes, then abruptly was told by a robot “goodbye”, and hung up on. Insane.< /Text>< username>

My experience with Enterprise was one of the best I had.  When I contacted them for a pickup, they had someone on the way in less than 15 minutes.  Nancy was extremely friendly and was very helpful, pointing out places around the area that I could visit while also advising on how to get there.  Once we were back at the office, I was processed quickly and was out the door and on my way to new experiences.  Great Customer Service!<//review>

<review>Rented a car for a week and extended it for another 3 days.   I was helped by Chris who has excellent customer service
(the reason I gave 3 🌟  instead of 1). Then Alex who was ok.
My issue was that I dropped off the car at 10am but,  I did not get a ride until 10:30am (had to argue about getting dropped off first).  I live only 3 miles away. If I called Lyft I would have been home in 10 minutes and paid only $10. I asked on the phone about pick up and dropped off service, I was told it was no problem.
When I rented a car at Enterprise located in Madison Street, which is about 6 miles from me, that Enterprise business facility dropped me off within 30 minutes!<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>For the first time from years of renting cars only from enterprise i was disappointed on all ends.
Understanding that the pick up the customer ads your company always runs it seemed a part of the service but either way when i call and you tell me 10 minutes there on the way then call back in 15 to be told just 10 more minutes then call back in 15 to be told sir it will be there with in 15. At last 45 minutes later you arrive. I can still make my doctors appointment as i hurry to the car. Thanks for getting me in a car immediately. As i get on already running behind i smell air freshener like we use in the hotel trade. Sure enough as i drive the cigarette smell starts taking over as I'm looking at the DO Not Smoke Sticker on the dash in front of me. The next day when i return i know they will relish my input to help correct these issue to better customer service. Stop! Did not happen. As your customer service representative does the car intake i mention the overpowering cigarette smell which he replies "Ya people don't listen" so i then ask him about my pickup yesterday and his reply "It is a complementary Service" at which point he gave me my total and walked off.
Missed the mark here and please change that ad to say "Hey call us its complimentary so if after 15 were not there call us back and just stick to that system until we arrive. And yes we have masks to cover the cigarette smell when it creeps its way out.
Respectfully your dedicated customer for over 10 years.

Great cars but the call center doesn't know much about the company's policies or what vehicles are going to be available.</text>

<Text>This place is a joke.  I reserved a truck, requested an F-150, and arrived at the facility when they opened to pick up the vehicle.  There were two F-150s on the lot, and when I went in to get one of them I was told they needed maintenance work and were not available to rent.  They offered me a Dodge 1500 with a partial back seat; adult passengers had a very uncomfortable ride.  I had no choice but to accept this truck.  I went  back a couple of hours later and both F-150s were gone.  What happened to the maintenance?  Apparently, they were saving them for other customers.  A real man doesn't lie to the face of another man.  Dishonesty is at the top of my list for flaws in a man's character.  I would like to say that this is the first time I've encountered untruths at Enterprise, but it's not.< /Text>< UserId.>

<Text>I rented a car to drive up north for Thanksgiving. This location was so helpful getting me the car the day of my reservation and we're very understanding and kind to my very active son and nephew. The lady who helped me was super sweet and got me in and out fast. Everything was seemless, from picking up to returning the car. Every staff member I dealt with were nothing but kind even when visibly busy. I highly recommend Enterprise Rent-A-Car and this location.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Great Service, I have rented over 10 times and ever time the service and selection was GREAT. You may have to wait your turn, but they will take car of you. Frequently a get an upgrade with no increase in price. This time it was from a sub compact to a nice Jeep. Don't listen to  selfish people that won't wait their turn!!! Mike</text>

<Text>I had a great experience with Enterprise.  I reserved on Orbitz for 2pm, but showed up at 10 am without any issue.  They upgraded me one rung without additional charge.  It took about 15 min. to finish the renting process.  My car was very clean and when I dropped off, it took only 10 min.  I paid exactly what I was quote....I will be back for all my business trips...< /Text>< Pictures>

I had made my reservation online but the place was swamped when I arrived around 9 am. Apparently several dealers were sending people over for recall issues. Even though the wait was about 30-40 minutes I was very happy with the Ford Focus I got. The mileage was good, car was comfortable and staff was helpful.
I will be renting again next month and will likely choose the same office.<//text>

<Review>Enterprise has been a steadfast, flexible rental firm for me for years.  In the rare moment I've used others, I regret the decision.   I needed a rental for my wifes car after a minor accident.  Enterprise handled smooth as silk as always.  Immediately following, within days, i needed a cheap rental for a 1-day use due to my truck being in for service.  Again, they hooked me up with no fanfare.  Their vehicles are in great shape and they handle any issues immediately, and always to my satisfaction, which is also rare.  Thank you Enterprise rental!< /Review><response>None</response><name>Martin Parish<//name><GmapID>0x80db7fb56a4d2d49:0xc3ba761dfefea7cf< /GmapID>< time>

Let me first start to mention that, out of all the years I have rented from Enterprise, I have never seen a busy store as this one on Ynez. It was packed with people coming and going. I really felt sorry for the employees that worked there, because they were actually running to keep everybody happy. I mean it was insane, they truly were under staff and under stocked. These vehicles were coming in and going out within minutes. They were never washed or correctly checked out. I mean how can you check a vehicle out in 5min? I found that the staff was doing everything in their power to satisfy everybody, and believe me they were nicest people I ever dealt with, but was definitely overwhelm. I will continue to use Enterprise in the future, but I hope someone reads this and does something good for that store.<//review>

<Review>Check out & back in were a breeze. Employees were awesome! My only complaint is for 3 years straight I have rented your vehicles  (for apx. 10 months total) and I have never been credited for any of it on your rewards program. Your employees have signed me up 3 times now & still nothing. Quite disappointing - who is getting the rental credits? Shouldn't it be the driver of the vehicle?< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I asked to ensure a car would be available to which I was assured there was. Went to pick up said car and the upgrade was conveniently unavailable. I believe this is what is referred to as Bait and Switch. It is considered bad business practice and unethical. There solution was to put me into the higher rate car. No offer to charge a economy and put me in the compact.  Their customer service and resolution practices are horrible.

Enterprise completely ruined my wedding day. We rented an intermediate SUV, was given a Dodge Journey that was unsafe to drive. We had a 12 hour drive up to the Redwoods for our wedding. This car was NOT going to make it.

The entire car would shake when using brakes on the freeway, it veered left the whole ride, unresponsive to acceleration and in order to make the car come to a full stop, you needed to slam down on the brakes, it also needed VERY frequent gas stops. Also, the suspension was questionable as the car bounced so much that we were afraid it would roll over.

This car caused us to be very behind schedule. We were outside Sacramento when we called to have the car exchanged, an employee directed us to the Oakland airport where they said the location was 24 hours. This was 1.5 hours out of the way and after struggling to get the car to Enterprise, we learned it was NOT 24 hours, so we had to wait 2 hours for them to open. An enterprise employee saw us and ignored us, not letting us know that the counter was no longer in use and that we needed to go to an outdoor kiosk to be served. No signage, no help. We then had to wait on a long line at 530am despite being there 2 hours before they opened. We didn't leave until close to 7am!!

They gave us a smaller car, stating it was the ONLY car they had. We had to unpack the whole car just to try, unsuccessfully, to pack it all into a smaller car. After asking for bungee cords to strap bags to the roof, they then magically found us a better car for the ride. Waiving the gas and upgrade was the VERY LEAST they could do.

At this point, we already missed our 130pm wedding, as we didn't arrive to our rental home until 130pm. Enterprise completely ruined our wedding. We never made it on time. We paid for a photographer (I have receipts), which is vital to any wedding, paid for 5.5 hours, 4 locations and a ceremony video. What we got was a rushed 1.5 hours, in 2 different locations that were changed last minute because of how late we were. Also, NO VIDEO to keep of our ceremony, that we were 4 hours late to, because of enterprise.

Enterprise told us that nothing could be done other than a complaint that wouldn't be answered for 72 hours, so upon returning the car, I complained to a manager named Kevin and got refunded for the rental. $130 is nothing compared to the stress, heart ache, broken plans and MONEY lost on this wedding that was RUINED completely by enterprise.

Your wedding day is supposed to be the happiest day of your life and I can say that it was one of the worst, thanks to Enterprise renting unsafe cars.

Been waiting on a manager (Kevin) to call me back since Monday. It's Thursday, I called again and STILL waiting on a call back. I will never use enterprise again.</Review>

< review>
I always get the best service at Enterprise car rental compared to the others. I mean, I actually rented a car at a place last thanksgiving at another place (Payless) because everyone else had no cars, and OMG I got there although I called 1/2 way there (ATL International Airport) they claim it was available, and it was not. The customer service was so horrible eye rolling, sending me finally to Avis who only had 15 passenger vehicle's for just myself and my husband to goto my brothers wedding day after thanksgiving.

Enterprise made it clear, you reserve timely your car will be waiting for you when you get there. I've always got my car, I've travel a lot and had to rent even when I have car problems they are friendly and they make things happen for you that others can't and won't. Thanks for he good service, keep it up and you keep me as a customer.</review>

This enterprise, really sucked. I called to get a car, and they made me do their job by calling one of their car suppliers, (where they get their cars from) in this case, it was a Cadillac dealership. I was on the phone letting it ring for so long, that my cell phone decided just to say, no one is going answer, and hung up for me.
_All of this took so long, I started calling at about 8:30 in the morning, and I finally got everything settled at 12 IN THE AFTERNOON. I can't even express the anger that I feel, they kept giving me the runaround, saying someone will call when no one did, only finally when I called and said never mind they suck and I will never use them again, did someone from another branch call me, and finally tell me THEY had the car I wanted. Never come here, I will never use this branches services again that's for sure.
_Although the VERY first time I used they they were really nice, and everything was how it should be, I did read the reviews, and I still tried them regardless. And this time since I had such a good experience, I would go again. But never again, that was all stupid and, believe what everyone is saying, they are hard to work with, and could care less about you.
UPDATE:It's not just quality, is low, overall is really bad I give a "0". I just don't know how to change that part.<//Review>

Renting a car with Enterprise was easy. The customer service I received was friendly and fair. I did not have to wait at all to get the car or turn it in. Since this was my first experience in renting a vehicle I would have to say that I would most certainly go back to Enterprise because of the overall  great customer service.</text>

<text>Do NOT use the Enterprise.  Chris has horrible customer service skills and I will not use Enterprise rental.  I needed a car and at first he told me he didn't have any then proceeded to tell me he "hopes I make it" by 6pm sarcastically when my plane was late and horrible traffic.  I told him I would be there at 555pm but he just had an attitude and can NOT mindset.  Horrible for business!  Avis is my car rental for all future business needs!</text><Response>None</Response><username>Amy Jones</username>< gmap_id>

I called to reserve a car, they agreed to pick me up from the vacation house I rented.

I called to confirm the pick up and they completely change what was said originally and they wouldn't take my debit card (because I don't live in Temecula). So I ended up stranded on the side of the road waiting for a ride.<//Review>< Pics>

< review>
This review is for the condition of the cars Enterprise rents to people.  Every time I'm stuck renting through Enterprise (my company mandates I use Enterprise when my company car is being repaired) I have to repeatedly change cars during my rental period because previous renters are rude/inconsiderate enough to bring their dog(s) inside the car, smoke inside the car and/or douse themselves in obnoxious cologne and get it all over the seat belt/seats, etc.  Since Enterprise spends about 5 minutes “cleaning” their cars before renting them out again their half-a**ed “cleaning” job rectifies NONE of these problems.  Unfortunately, now I am stuck right before the holidays renting from Enterprise again and will have the misfortune of being without my dog-free, smoke-free, cologne-free car for almost 3 weeks.  Which brings me to my current, but unsurprising, situation with Enterprise.  Out of all the times I’ve been forced to rent from Enterprise this time is the worst.  I’ve been in a rental for 3 days now and have already been through 3 cars:  Car #1 – picked up at the Gosch Ford dealership.  I asked for a dog-free, smoke-free car because I am allergic to both.  What I got was a car full of dog hair.  The rep had cleaned out the front seat/back seat of the car (the area most people look at when they rent) so when I got in it seemed okay (other than the very strong air freshener smell) but it wasn’t until I got home (after driving the car for hours with watery eyes and sneezing repeatedly) that I decided to open the back hatch and that’s where I found all the disgusting dog hair.  I was sick the rest of the night and returned the car the next morning.  Car #2 – swapped Car #1 for Car #2 at the Gosch Ford dealership location.  After horrible Car #1 I went to the Ynez-Temecula location (because they have larger inventory) to try and swap out my Car #1 rental for a dog-free/smoke-free car and they said they had no cars for rent in the same class as my current rental so they called the Gosch Ford dealership location and secured another car for me.  Already late for a work appointment I rushed over to Gosch Ford and the rep assured me this car was dog-free/smoke-free and as soon as he was done “cleaning” it I got in the car and off I went.  This time the smell of air-freshener was overpowering but I rolled down the windows and waited for it to dissipate. It wasn’t too long before I realized the car had been doused with air freshener to cover up the noxious smell of smoke.  With multiple work appointments all day/night all over Southern California there was no way I could return the car that day so I had to stick it out until the end of my workday (9 pm) and my reward was a migraine that was so bad I could barely function.  Soured on the Ynez and Gosch Ford locations I decided to swap the car out the next day (today) at the Madison-Murrieta location.  Car #3 –  After having explained my problems with the 2 cars I received in 2 days the branch manager appeared to want to help “make things right”.  I had my choice of 2 cars:  One that smelled heavily of smoke and one that had a strange, unidentifiable smell that wasn't pleasant but didn’t smell like smoke or dog.  Since I’d already spent all morning calling all Enterprise locations within a 60 mile radius of my home and had been told there was nothing available I was stuck so I chose the car with the strange, unidentifiable smell.  After driving the car around for about 10 minutes I realized there was another weird smell besides the original strange one: Weed.  An hour later, with the help of the internet, I was able to identify the original strange smell:  A different strain of weed from the other weed smell.  Wonderful.  So now I’m stuck with another smelly and, as usual, filthy Enterprise rental car until my car is fixed in 3 weeks.  Lucky me though, I’m on Enterprise’s “call list” if anything else becomes available so maybe I’ll get lucky and they’ll swap my current rental out for one where someone has vomited or s**t in it.  Enterprise, you’re a disgrace.<//review>

Last month I went in at opening to see Cameron to make several reservations.  What I watched for 20 minutes was horrific!

So bottom line they are friendly people but they need a policy change! I am here in at the Temecula branch trying to get a rental car because the ford dealership here in town needs my car for a day. Ford sent me out here to get the rental and because I am not 21 years old they won’t grant me one day of collision insurance. The thing that doesn’t make any sense is that people start driving at 16 and at 18 some people don’t live with “mommy and daddy” so they can’t get someone else to get the car. Like I said they are friendly people I’ve been asked if I need a ride back to the ford dealership by the gentlemen working behind the desk 3 times now writing this review but change your policy. My name is Jameson Shuster and I’m stationed at Camp Pendleton mommy and daddy are a little to far away for me to get help. Thank you to the good employees working here trying to help me out but their hands are tied and I understand that.

Update: I forgot to mention that I called my insurance and had them update it so I fall under enterprise guidelines but it doesn’t take affect until 1201am so they still won’t help me.< /review>

<review>I used to rent cars more often with business travel but in the last few years that hasn't been a need until the last few months.  I had a nightmare experience with Budget/Temecula - they can't pick you up if its 1/8 of a mile over two miles! Which I did not know till I called the day before I was leaving to find out. Ssssoooo... I went back to trusty Enterprise. Cameron and the regular staff there is AWESOME.  Yes, its a busy store and I usually have to wait sometimes up to 30 minutes but I've now used them several times in a few months and its always a pleasant experience, they remember the customer's name and really hustle to make it a good purchase.</review>< pictures>

<Text>Long distance drive, needed windshield washer fluid to wipe away bugs. had to refill the tank myself only with water and when attempting to use it, both spray nozzles were clogged or inoperable and couldn't help clean the windshield. The Ford Expedition 2017 had plenty of comfy room for 6 of us and all our stuff. However, when fully loaded and driving on curved road conditions, this truck steering was loose or had enough play in the wheel to be not as responsive as expected when slightly turned right or left. wouldn't consider it unsafe but being behind the wheel you really had to make adjustments only on curved roads even within posted speed limits.
Would had preferred a Chevy Suburban which I called 2 days prior to confirm reservation for my first choice and Chris noted he would try to locate one from another rental office. The option was the Ford Expedition when I showed up for the rental, which I didn't mind since they have the same amount of room for 6 or 7 passengers. If Temecula office cant  locate a Chevy or get one in time, I may have to consider using another field office location with more selections, though understanding perhaps those Chevy rentals were already accounted for. Will try again for next trip in July with my 10% discount they offered on my next rental because all of the above!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>horrible customer service skills, quick to lie in order to explain themselves if they are even willing to explain the issue, and they tell you what you want to hear over the phone to get you into the office then make you wait often 10-40 minutes just to then tell you that you were miss informed and that they can't (won't) help you. i have had these issues several times in 3 months time, however hertz has been very helpful with all my renting needs.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I always have good experiences with the crew at enterprise.I make my reservation on-line and i always get a call just before someone picks me up and takes me to the office. Cameron or Kevin are very professional and get me on my way quickly. I recommend anyone that wants no-nonsence service to visit there office and i,m quite sure they will help you. Now the only problem i have is at certain times of the week there are lines, so i recommend that you call in advance to see if there is a packed house, monday mornings and friday afternoons are usually crowded.< /Text><Rate>5<//Rate><time>1445491650707< /time>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>1</Rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>I went in requesting a Hyndai Elantra around 130pm and was told one was expected at  330pm and would be reserved for me.  In the meantime they told me to go ahead and sign for a Nissan Sentra and use it for 2 hours  and come back for the Elantra at 330pm.  At  330 I called to  see if the Elantra was ready for me. The lady who answered my call said"WE DON"T MAKE ANY PROMISES FOR  ANYTHING!"She continued ON and ON with how its soooo imposssible.  Well  I talked to the manager and he said he would work on getting the Elantra for me . Unfortunately he was not available the next two days and again I got another person who gave me the no Promises and No Guarantee's speech.

I was told this location excepted debit cards so I make a reservation and rushed over on my break to pick up the vehicle I reserved. Oh well I guess today they must of changed their policy because customer service said I was given false info yesterday prior to making a reservation... So I guess Im SOL because now everything is closed till Monday but now I  will be going to Hertz!<//text>

<Review>After 3 years of 3 German Shepherds, it was time to refresh the lawn and tune up some spots that had more pronounced matting.
I received a solid job, as advertised. But, more than that, I was waaay impressed with the attention to detail given by “Gonzo” during the job. He was meticulous in getting every just so.
Bottom line, I was more than impressed on the high-quality effort with my 500 sq. ft.
Kudos!< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1vPTaW6rCgCxXdsPkz4lFYPbbBjwZUIcLgmk_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1622848856717, 'text': 'Hi M!

< Review>
TurFresh was awesome when they serviced my front and backyard.  I moved into my house about a year ago and the previous owner had large dogs, so the backyard never smelled right.  I would hose it down and treat it with all sorts of "recommended products" but the smell was always back within two days.  I have two medium size dogs so that doesn't help either.  TurFresh was here all day and I can honestly say that I am so impressed.  Not only does the grass look amazing but my backyard smells wonderful even a week later.  My dogs were not loving all of their scents being gone but they are getting used to it, although they are really only "going" in one area of the yard now.  Which is awesome!  I would recommend TurFresh to anyone with artificial grass; you won't regret it.<//Review>

I recently bought a home in Thousand Oaks. It came with artificial turf. I do not know if or when it had ever been cleaned. I  had my artificial turf cleaned in my front and back yard by Turfresh. Jesus did a wonderful job. It looked, felt, and smelled brand new when he was done. I am going to sign up for a regular service. Sheila<//review>

After our first service visit from the TurFresh team (Jesus) happy to report that "So far so good!".

What we thought would be a permanent stench of dog urine in our backyard (in San Francisco) after trying every remedy ourselves, has now turned into a fresh smelling plot of artificial turf in our backyard.

We can finally enjoy our backyard to its fullest :)  We look forward to our monthly service calls by the TurFresh team.</Text>

<Text>My turf has been installed for about 5 years now. I have 2 dogs and a couple years ago I thought about removing the turf due to the smell. I tried cleaning it myself and used various products but was not happy with the results. I have used TurFresh a couple times a year for about 2 years now. After observing their multi-step process and than seeing (and smelling) the results, I was very impressed and I have no doubt that the service will greatly extend the life of my turf. It certainly has allowed us to enjoy the yard throughout the year. This is a true deep cleaning and treatment process that leaves my turf looking like new and smelling better than new. So happy I found them!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1609264221602, 'text': 'Hi Randall! Thank you for your review.

<Text>So to begin I have to say I was a little put off by Randy’s insistence that we pay up front. I was a first time customer and they there was no way I was going to pay on the phone never having met them. He settled for allowing me to pay the minute to he driver pulled up. Again weird. We almost cancelled. However; Jesus arrived promptly at promised time and couldn’t have been nicer or more professional! Loved him! Service was excellent and our turf looks and smells amazing!  I found out that the men/ women who do the service Travel long distances. That would explain the need for some sort of payment up front so they don’t get stiffed!  If Randy had explained This to me perhaps I would have understood!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>These guys are the professionals who keep your artificial turf clean, looking brand new, and smelling fresh. They sell their products online, and also offer professional application if you live locally. I found them online last year and decided to self-apply, so I stopped by the business for supplies. Their products are by far the best pro-grade stuff available anywhere! Highly concentrated enzymes to break down pet waste, sanitize, and stop the odor. This stuff really works! We sometimes watch our he in-laws dogs when they vacation, so after a week of dog sitting, I’m ready to clean up the backyard turf. It’s so easy to use, and works better than anything I’ve ever tried. I now go back once a year to get refills, and our backyard is clean and safe for the little ones to crawl on. BTW, they’re super friendly there too!< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIk87Uwy_kcvwwGDbiEa8E7qOvLxn-m6LPPcMd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8WwqkMmohtQVwmibHjOQn6tDL6QzYBexTxTyO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

I’ve had turf for many years and always struggled trying to keep it clean smelling and looking fresh. The blades naturally get trampled down and we have three dogs in our family.  TurFresh did an amazing job for us from start to finish.  They were easy to work with, have great support technology, and the end result was beyond expectations!  Our very professional technician was fantastic and worked through the steps of the multi part cleaning and application process on a hot, 114 degree Phoenix day.   The turf looks wonderful and smells great ( no more pet odor ).  We have signed up for ongoing regular service and look forward to more outstanding results.

Thanks and Great job!!  👍😀🐶🐶🐶😎</text>

TurFresh is amazing! We have two dogs and two kids so our grass needed some refreshing! I was really impressed with the great customer service from everyone. The people who cleaned our grass did a very thorough job. They spent a lot of time making sure our grass was clean. It now looks like it did when we first got it about three and a half years ago. I am beyond impressed and would recommend them to anyone who has artificial turf. Their service is worth every penny! Thanks so much. We are very happy we called TurFresh and will be using their services in the future!!</review>

We have a small area of Turf in our backyard- less than 300 sq feet- we have 1 small dog and once or twice a week our children bring their dogs - I’ve tried to keep our turf fresh smelling by using a power washer and Simple Green turf cleaner. Unfortunately I was unable to get rid of the urine smell. I searched online and found Turfresh - although it was expensive - one day later No smell! Not sure how long it will last. Hopefully at least 6 months.
Luis, who did the cleaning was exactly on time, very professional, and was very personable. He didn’t mind our chihuahua barking at him!
Randy runs the business very professionally!</text>

<review>I made an appointment with TurFresh and was told that a technician would be at my house by 8 a.m.  I received a text the day before appointment with the name and photo of the technician, his name was Oswaldo.    Oswaldo showed up right at 8 and was very professional, he went right to work and completed the work in a timely manner.  The turf was over 4 years old and when Oswaldo was done with it it looked as good as the day it was installed.  I would highly recommend TurFresh to my friends and family.</review><rate>5< /rate>< response>

I have 3 dogs and the yard was smelly. I tried everything then I found Turfresh. My yard is small, 370 sq feet.
Turfresh did as advertised. They showed up on time, explained the process, measured the yard and went to work. I watched as the turf was brushed back, granules and deodorizer were applied. The technician even went slightly passed the edge of the astro to help with odor. When all was done, about 2 hrs later, I had a beautiful looking, clean feeling and fresh smelling yard. 2 days later it still smells good.
I am doing this quarterly. It is well worth the money.</Text>

I was on the fence of having a service done due to the cost, but I'm glad I finally did it.  The service appointment was great!  The tech did an amazing job on a lawn that I don't think has ever been serviced in 17 years?  The lawn looks and smells better! Definitely recommend!<//review>

<review>I have had artificial turf in my backyard for many years.  I started using Turfresh a couple years ago and could not be happier.  Their annual cleaning program and service is Absolutely OUTSTANDING.  A special shout out to Luis who went the extra mile.  He was courteous, professional, and worked incredibly hard, as Turfresh always does.  I am not someone who normally posts reviews, but would absolutely recommend Turfresh 100%.  My 10 year old turf looks and smells brand new.  Thank you Luis, Randy and Turfresh.  A++++!!!!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Began working by using a rotating gas powered brush. I could not believe how much dog hair and leaves, etc were down deep into the turf! He completed that step followed by new granules spread over and brushed in the now new looking turf. Next he sprayed this amazing smelling spray (think of a baby's nursery) all over the turf and even onto about 6 feet of the patio adjacent to the turf. I'm telling you the service was well worth the money. Signed up for quarterly service and saved quite a bit of money. The turf looks brand new! Would highly recommend TurFresh!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

These guys are top notch!! Randy was super quick to communicate when I requested to schedule an appointment. They are located in CA, but come to AZ as well. I actually received a coupon in the mail for $50 off and thought it was a great time to have our turf area cleaned. It's been three years since we had it installed and we've got 2 small dogs and 3 cats that are on it all the time. The sweet guy that showed up did amazing with social distancing, which was a great relief. He worked magic in that area and then wanted to show us the finished job so that we could approve of the work. Will def recommend these guys and will def use them again! Thank you so much!!!< /Text>

<review>We have two Great Danes and two Shepard mixes; 350 lbs of dog! Our turf takes a beating to say the least. Being in Arizona, where the heat makes the pet smell worse has been tough. TurFresh has been fantastic! Not trying to oversell us on more cleaning than we need, accommodating our schedule, overly large area to be cleaned, and budget. We genuinely look forward to our biannual cleaning and pet infill refresh every time!< /review>< date>

Been using the service for several months now and very satisfied with the results and the customer service provided. I have 3 big dogs and have been getting quarterly service and it's been effective - even here in AZ where the heat can really make the smells from the turf unpleasant. The treatment does the trick and the deep cleaning provided is something that I couldn't do on my own. Well worth the cost after seeing the results!<//review>

We got our turf installed about 3 years ago and we have 4 dogs.  Needless to say, our yard needed help.  I reached out and Randy was so helpful.  He answered all my questions and explained the process in great detail.  Oswaldo came out to our house to do the work.  He arrived on time, was very friendly and did an AMAZING job.  Not only did he clean the turf - it looks BRAND NEW - he went the extra mile and swept the patio.  Our yard looks great! TurFresh exceeded my expectations.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!< /text>

We have 3 dogs and the grass was smelling pretty bad, especially when it was hot outside. They spent 3 hours there ( 550 sqft) and really worked hard at getting the odor out.
Super nice and polite.

<Review>We took a gamble on this — getting our turf cleaned.  There was about 10 years of dog pee/hair/dirt build up and it got to the point we couldn’t even sit outside because of the smell. We invested in some bio fill from amazon and that really helped but having it really deep cleaned has taken the smell away completely and the turf (no joking) looks brand new. The person who did our yard arrived in a uniform and arrived early. This wasn’t a quick clean and then gimme my money company. They did do much! First they did a top level clean which was a rake and blow off any leaves - that made the yard look nice but that’s when the real work started- they used that brush machine and picked up a small bin full of stuff. I was blown away. Then they used bio fill and then a pet deodorizer solution, then more raking etc. We had a family member install turf new recently and ours looks just like hers now. This company also actually listed to us and focused on more high traffic areas.  I would most certainly recommend them!!!!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

It had been over 2 years since we installed the lawn and have 2 100 pound dogs...my lawn needed help. We called alma and set up an appointment.  She showed up a few minutes early, pricing was as promised and with no surprises. 2 hours later it looked like new and the smell was gone. My wife and I are extremely happy.</text>

Very quick to respond, very friendly. My turf is 2 years old now, 2 dogs, kids, turf is used and abused. Turf was starting to stain from the sand underneath. After the treatment, my grass looks brand new, I really wish I took a before and after photo. Very happy with my service.</review>

He was very nice and let me know he didn’t need anything else from me. (It was very hot and he didn’t want me standing outside). He completed the scheduled work within about an hour. Everything was clean when he left and our yard looks like the day it was installed. The smell of our three dogs was completely gone. We will  definitely be an ongoing customer.< /review>< Pics>

After 5 years of having 2 dogs and not doing anything to our turf, we decided to take the plunge and get it cleaned. Not only did we receive stellar customer service, but we could not be happier with the job that TurFresh did. Our turf looks immaculately clean and smells even better. For those of you that hesitate to get your turf cleaned, don’t - it was worth every penny! I highly recommend TurFresh and will be using them again in the future.</Text>

I highly recommend Turfresh!! This is a great service for anyone with pets and artificial grass. There’s just no way to get it clean yourself. It’s absolutely  amazing how clean and fresh it is after the service. Oswaldo is great and so detail oriented!! He made sure he had every bit of the yard sparking clean. What a difference! I will be using this company regularly!!< /text>

Just Wow! Thank you sooo much to Randy and the major rockstar…Alma! I was thoroughly impressed with this service. I initially thought it was a bit pricey but after the work Alma put in on her initial visit I actually found my yard looking nearly brand new again! And, when my yard smelled again the next day, Randy had Alma come back late that evening and even had her leave solution with me. It was definitely worth every penny and more! Not to mention Alma is so sweet and explains everything as well. I cannot thank Turfresh enough!< /review>

<Review>I love artificial turf for my dogs but the urine smell can be terrible at times even with regular hosing down and deodorizing with store bought products. I hired TurFresh to help with my problem and their service technician was on time, very professional and did an awesome job cleaning and deodorizing the turf in my backyard. This is a great service and i will definitely use them again.< /Review>< gmap_id>

We have artificial lawn "used" daily by our two very large and active Standard Poodles.  Our turf is now 7 years old and looks new -- no tears, no smell, no problems.  TurFresh is true to their word, we are very happy customers.<//review>< Pics>

Excellent service. Everyone at TruFresh was friendly, professional and courteous. When I moved into my townhome, the artificial turf was already installed, so it’s about 15 years old and it was looking shabby. Also, my dog is using it as a bathroom so it could get a little smelly at times. TruFresh just finished and my turf looks and smells great! Thank you for a job well done.<//text>

<review>I ordered biofill and bioturf spray from Trufresh.  Their products are outstanding and extremely high quality.  The granular deoderizer is amazing. The odors from my pet's area have been eliminated and the turf spray keeps it clean. I'm so happy with the results. I had also spoken with John there for re-ordering and he was incredibly helpful. They are very efficient with their shipping. Both of my orders were received within days. Not only am I incredibly satisfied with the products, I am impressed with the exceptional customer service they have given me. I will continue to re-order their products for my artificial turf and highly recommend the Turfresh company.</review>< Pictures>

Just perfect... staff always so nice. Rides are not expensive, pumpkings can be a little cheaper but overall really nice.</text>

I like the set up that they have. My daughters loved getting in the little train. They have hand sanitizers and masks provided for everyone, and they are making sure everyone is being safe. I went to take pictures with the pumpkins,  and had my daughter go in all the inflatables,  they loved it.<//text>

<Text>We came Thursday night, it was busy but even though the lines seemed long, they went quick, and there were so many perfect pumpkins to choose from, and the tickets were very reasonably priced! Could use a few more fun items for the older kids. They also had wheel barrels for loading up the pumpkins which was convenient. Definitely would visit again.< /Text>< pictures>

It’s not open! Disappointing I really wanted to go like I do every year and be able to at least get out for once before my due date and it said it was open so me and my husband got ready and showed up, they had everything set outside but it was closed. So why have it say it’s open on here when it’s not open yet. And I really wanted funnel cake☹️< /Review>

<text>Kids have a lot of fun but everything is super expensive. 1 dollar per ticket so expect on spending a lot, when every ride is 2-10 tickets.
Have to pay 1$ for the petting zoo and then an extra three tickets..... for five minutes.
Also got very annoyed when we tried ordering a funnel cake waited 35 minutes and the workers were saying they were closed 30 minutes before 9 (closing time)</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1570817074598, 'text': "Hello Karen. I'm sorry you had a bad experience with our vendor. They rent space from us and do not have the same hours of operation. We have 2 choices for the petting zoo, you can do one or both. For 3 tickets you can go in and pet the animals or you may feed the animals with a $1 purchased food cup. The average price of an attraction is 3 tickets, only the Bungee is 10 tickets. We are not the cheapest but we are a once a year annual tradition for many. Making memories that last a lifetime for about the same price as dinner and a movie."}< /resp>

Just moved to the high desert and this was me and my family's first time coming here my 4 kids had a GREAT time i recommend bringing the kids here any time it is a little pricey 1$ per ticket and the games vary from ticket "prices" some are 1 ticket up to 10 tickets but you gotta expect to spend if youre taking your kids out for a good time the funnel cakes were really good only thing i wish there was is more food vendors there's only 1 and the wait time can get a little ridiculous but overall a good fun place to go with your family<//review>

I love this gym so much! The trainers are amazing and always so helpful with any questions you might have. I couldn’t even pick a favorite because they’re all so amazing to work with. Coach Tim really knows his stuff and puts together a really great workout plan. I saw a ton of results coming here!</Text>

I've now completed 50 classes at Allegiate with no back pain.

The space is great, the staff is energetic and knowledgeable, and the classes are setup to maintain the consistency we are all looking for from a gym.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>My experience at Allegiate has been wonderful, I've been a member now for about four months. The staff and coaches are all courteous, professional and thoughtful. From the first day I stepped through the front door I have always felt welcomed. The strength training program is amazing, I never feel like I'm racing through my workout, all the coaches push form over weight/reps.. I've see immediate results because of this and I feel great.< /Text>< Pictures>

While visiting the Los Angeles area for a week I was looking for a good gym so I could continue exercise even away from home.

A quick search around the Redondo area led me straight to Allegiate and I’m glad I found it!

Their staff are knowledgeable & welcoming, their members are friendly, and the workouts varied and challenging. All in all, exactly what I was looking for while traveling.

If you value strength training in a high-quality group environment, drop by Allegiate.

Thanks to Coaches Tim, Kirk, Corbin, Walter, Cody, and to staff Jake, Jacob and Cisco for being so great.< /Review>

<Text>I checked out several gyms in the South Bay before finding Allegiate and I am sooo thankful that I did! It's run by incredible coaches who are knowledgeable, professional, encouraging and simply amazing! They continually monitor your progress, correct your form, and encourage and push you towards your goal. The coaches and the gym itself is just a no frills gym that is state of the art serious business of training! Whether I am working on strength, mobility, or conditioning--I get personalized cutting edge coaching and program and attention that would normally cost a fortune (don't get any ideas Cody about raising my rate!). I LOVE Allegiate and especially during the pandemic when physical and mental health has been challenging, finding this gym has been a life saver and the best investment!<//Text>< pictures>

I love everything Allegiate! What sets this gym apart from others is their training program. I like that it incorporates mobility along with strength training. My range of movement has improved and I feel stronger. I love that they change up their program every four weeks and the coaches are right there to guide you through form and technique. There are classes every half hour and the class size is small.< /Text>

There is a great selection of classes to choose from. The coaches are top notch and with 6 people currently to a class, you get tons of attention and help when necessary. They set up a great atmosphere that's both fun and hyper focused at the task at hand. There's something for every experience level.

I’ve really enjoyed training in such a close knit team environment at Allegiate. All the coaches are super knowledgeable and can correct or modify any exercise to make sure I’m getting the best out of my workout. I love having the option to mix up the week day strength sessions with some conditioning sessions on the weekends to get the best of both styles of workouts. Everyone, including the other members, are so welcoming and friendly. The team dynamic is a great motivator to show up regularly and work hard.< /Review>

I joined Allegiate a little over a year ago. It is by far the best training and gym experience I’ve had over the years. The trainers are dedicated experienced professionals who are truly passionate about what they do. They work with every member to be sure they’re progressing through each “block” and getting the most from every session. On top of that everyone there is so welcoming and it truly is a “Team” environment. It makes it fun to “go to the gym.” Hands down the best around!<//text>

Allegiate is great for people with all levels of gym experience.  The coaches are very knowledgeable for beginners and also know how to push the experienced members in every workout!  100% would recommend becoming a member here :)
The workouts have gotten me in great shape post quarantine! And I feel that safety and health of members is a top priority during Covid.< /Review>

<Text>As other reviewers have noted, the facilities and equipment at Allegiate are top-notch, the programming is fantastic (4-week blocks that progressively build strength and mobility), and the coaches and staff are beyond excellent. There is an overwhelming sense of camaraderie and cooperation among the members, which run the spectrum from experienced former collegiate athletes to newbies and beginners.

All you really need to be successful at an Allegiate group fitness session is a positive attitude and a willingness to show up. The day’s workout is thoughtfully planned out to maximize your results, and each movement is clearly demonstrated by the instructor so that it’s understood by every participant. New members (which I was this year) are quickly integrated and begin making progress on day one from whatever level of fitness they bring.

Personally, as a busy and sometimes harried father of four, I highly value the hours I spend at Allegiate each week, focusing on my own health and well-being in a positive and supportive environment. Continually improving my fitness and strength provides a tangible sense of accomplishment that spills over into all areas of my life. Training at Allegiate in 2020 has been and continues to be a blessing to me. I highly and unconditionally recommend it to anyone!</Text></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been at Allegiate since January 2018 (WHAT?!) and there’s a reason I’ve never left. I’ve never belonged to any gym for that length of time or had any desire to *cue typical workout boredom*.

The way these programs are designed met a need that I didn’t even consciously realize I had, emphasizing functional fitness and strength over a desired physique. I’m sure every review also notes this, but the people here are top-notch. All different backgrounds and athletic experience are welcome and it forges a strong community!

I say all this and need to make it clear—these programs aren’t easy. AT ALL. That’s the best part. They’re tough and they push you. Sometimes it feels as though they’ve been concocted in a mad scientist’s lab (that’d be Head Coach Tim Caron’s brain). But all you need to do is show up and the atmosphere will handle the rest.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>I 100% recommend Allegiate if you care about getting into your best shape and want to be trained by pros in a positive and motivating environment. I discovered Allegiate when I moved to the South Bay and was looking for a gym that could help me improve my overall strength and physique. The staff worked with me to understand my goals, needs and scheduling constraints and put together a custom program that is constantly being tweaked based on my progress. Their program has allowed me to stop worrying about how much weight I am lifting and instead focusing form, avoiding injury and quick recovery. As a result, I've seen noticeable improvements in my strength, energy and physique that others have noticed too. In addition to results, Allegiate cares about its people. All of the trainers are talented and passionate about what they do and they care about their clients. They make you feel welcome and are always encouraging you to push yourself harder than you think you can. I encourage you to come check it out for yourself, you won't regret it!</review>< pics>

Outstanding coaches and a program that focuses on total body health  (joint health, muscle release post-workout, nutrition, etc...) in addition to fitness (strength, cardio, interval training, flexibility). Would rate 10/10 if Google would allow for it.

Note, it is more expensive than many other gyms in the area, but it is absolutely worth it.<//review>

<Review>I am so glad I decided to come here. As I did my search for a place to go, and there are many, I was looking for some sort of functional fitness. That was what I googled. Again, many placed came up. I read through the plans, schedules, abouts, staff etc... I chose Allegiate after seeing the idea of where the coaches ( programs) are coming from. My hope was to have a work out that I was able to keep doing and not avoid things by getting hurt. Went for the trial and learned more. They watch form, give alternate ideas if something is bothering you, explain why you are working what you are. I have some days where my body is rejecting life and there is no judging from the coaches or the other members. Even if I whine they seem to tolerate it. They were very quick as well during covid with changes. We were not left without the ability to meet (virtually) with Covid, there were even multiple time slots offered. Right now the class size is small and Covid friendly. And for the same price as before covid. So more personal. Please come!<//Review><time>1598643480032</time></record>

I began my membership at Allegiate in the fall of 2019. After almost a year of training with Tim and his staff, I can confidently say both my physical and mental capabilities have expanded immensely. A small testament to this fact is that when I showed up to the first Team practice I could barely do one unassisted pull up. Only a few months into my membership I was able to do three, and almost a year after that first practice I hit a PR of 8 unassisted pull ups in a row and am still improving daily. Most importantly to me, as a former D1 rugby player who has sustained several injuries, they have taught me so much about how to properly train and take care of my body. Training with Allegiate has shifted how I view working out to much more focused and sustainable objectives that have ultimately led to longer term results. I cannot say enough about Allegiate’s programming, staff, or training philosophy; hands down 5/5.</Review>

- Programs and classes that are varied, but also build off of each other - helping you to progress and learn as you do the work

- Founders that not only have the knowledge, but do the work, and can prove that their programming works

- Engaged and enthusiastic coaches and staff who have done the work as well

- A strong community of members who approach each class with grit and determination

- Support beyond just the workout -  learning and understanding more about my mobility, nutritional, and supplemental needs

I have been training with Allegiate for a couple of years now. Originally, I joined the gym as a "Digital Member". The training regiment that Allegiate put me through in that capacity was solid.  I did not have to think when I entered the gym as they created the exercise blocks for me, I only had to show up and execute them.

Over time I got exhausted from training on my own and sought out different gyms and fitness experiences. On top of strength training, I am an avid mountain trekker. I spend most of the year training for my long distance treks and I found that without proper guidance I continued to get injured during my training. This is what has brought me back to Allegiate.

This time I have decided to participate in their "Team" training classes. At these classes I am able to get the necessary coaching from a knowledgeable and seasoned trainer while also lifting in a group environment. I have been to many HIIT gyms, or strength training classes but at Allegiate they pride themselves on teaching good form and putting you in a group that fits your weight class. It is a strength training gym and the members breath that fire.

Bottom line, I couldn't be happier with the product they provide and the in-depth all encompassing approach they take on weight training. Can't wait for Century City!< /review>

I am definitely not a gym guy and had reservations about joining but after the first session I knew I made the right decision. The coaches and staff are incredible, very knowledgeable and it is clear that they are there to do their best for you. Highly recommend this for people of all fitness levels.<//Review>

They invest in top notch modern equipment and the trainers are some of the best I've worked with. I've primarily been working with Andres, Corbin, and Nate and you'd be hard pressed to find trainers of their caliber elsewhere. My strength, mobility, and technique have all improved significantly.

I used to avoid intense strength training out of fear of injury due to a history of previous sports injuries.  Allegiate's approach is different from the Crossfits of the world though - preventing potential injury is a top priority and the ego stuff isn't a part of the culture.

Highly recommend Allegiate if you're looking for a different and forward thinking approach to your fitness.</text>< Pictures>

Allegiate is great. Highly recommend. True story.

Never really been a gym guy. Cross-fit seemed like too much for me (mostly the closer-to-cult vibe I got). I tried Orange Theory (too dark, music - meh). But without the time to do triathlons I needed to find a new routine. Allegiate has been a phenomenal choice. Cody and Tim have created an environment that is welcoming but not intrusive. Tim has designed programs accessible to the most inexperienced with a path to scaling to the highest levels. I appreciate the thoughtfulness, the care, and the passion they both put into all aspects of Allegiate - including the programs during the early Covid days. And I have to mention the 1-year anniversary hoodie that now happens to be my favorite hoodie (well, aside from the 2004 Red Sox ALCS Champions hoodie that is stained with bleach)!

In all seriousness, I never feel pressure to be there but I ALWAYS feel grateful for having spent the time (and the money). I'd recommend Allegiate for the beginner to the expert - from the shy to the outgoing. Give it a go and see what you think. I can guarantee you'll leave feeling stronger and with more mobility than when you got there. And you'll enjoy some good tunes, some fresh air, and some hilarious banter from the staff.<//Text>

<text>Allegiate is an excellent, best-of-both worlds gym option, where you get focused, intelligent one-on-one training in a small group setting. I joined three months before getting married and as an aging athlete considering retirement. After a couple months with Tim and his team I looked and felt better than I have, well, ever. Allegiate takes mobility very seriously as a component of strength (something I ignored for 20+ years) and as a result I was moving more smoothly while also enjoying more explosive power. The team really knows their stuff and they create a welcoming, fun training environment. Cannot recommend highly enough.< /text><pics>None</pics><time>1568056091702< /time>< gmap_id>

For the past 10 or so years I was “going to the gym” and not getting a lot of value out of it. Had a good friend at Allegiate and he introduced me to the guys. I’d never really known what it meant to train and honestly didn’t want to pay for private training at my current gym. I’m 4 months in here and in the best shape I’ve been in since I was much younger.  I’m not just working out I’m learning how to do it correctly and having fun at the same time.  I’ll be 47 in March and addicted to the experience now. Thanks a lot for everything team!!<//review>

I joined Allegiate a year ago and am so glad I did! They truly “get it” for a few reasons. They provide consistent high quality strength and conditioning training, and have helped me improve my mobility and flexibility. The coaches are knowledgeable, professional and encouraging. Their classes are fun and emphasize a positive environment. Members range in age and it’s a great group of people. I’m proud of the place I train at.</Review>

I started at Allegiate 6 months ago, coming off 10 years of triathlon training and bilateral shoulder injuries, with little weight training. Thanks to the instruction and guidance I've received at Allegiate, I've safely regained most of my pre-injury shoulder strength and I'm more well rounded physically. The trainers there are spot on, so knowledgable and attentive. The effort and detail that goes into the programming is staggering. All the movements, the lifts, the warmups and the cool downs are interconnected and based on solid science. Tim and Cody have created a welcoming environment and I continue to look forward to each class.</Text>

Love this place! After spending a few years training for triathlons, was looking to switch it up and found my way to Allegiate based on recommendations from several friends. When I first walked through the doors, quickly realized I had found "my people." Great atmosphere and great program. Really feel like I'm training and not just randomly exercising, which is perfect for my *slightly* competitive nature and overall motivation. Coaches are very knowledgeable and the member culture is fantastic as well!<//Text>

Allegiate is a high quality training facility with a team culture. I drive from Glendale to Redondo because it's the best training in the city and helps with my nutrition, strength, breathing, mobility. It's a life changer because since I played college football I've been yearning for coaching and a team that is at the level that I'm accustom to but has the sensitivity to navigate my injuries and Allegiate is the perfect place for that. And the swag is amazing.< /review>

<review>I just hit my 50th visit at Allegiate and have to say that the workouts are always excellent! Their approach to strength training is what I was looking for when I searched for a new gym. This isn't just any gym though. The training sessions are so good and really different than what I've experienced at other gyms. The strength and mobility exercises in each session also work perfectly with my physical therapy needs to help recover from a martial arts injury. I actually use the knowledge I've gained there and apply it to my daily routine at work so I can keep my body safe from injuries. It also goes beyond just the training sessions too. They really know their stuff when it comes to nutrition and taking the right supplements that's right for you. Lastly, all the staff and members are so cool and friendly, and the music rocks! I can't say enough good things about Allegiate. Thank you guys!</review>< pics>

Allegiate is a unique and amazing gym.  I have done strength training on my own for over 20 years and am very particular about where and how I train.  I have been going to Allegiate for six months and have learned a ton about healthy strength training.  The four week blocks of training are extremely well designed keeping strength, recovery and improvement in mind.  The coaches all watch each member to make sure they are on point with technique to avoid injury.  Allegiate is a special place, and I am so grateful I discovered it.<//review>

Other gyms seemed so mechanical when it came to trying out their gym, only focusing on closing the sale. Allegiate staff on the other hand always remembered my name and focused on my fitness goals rather than price points making it much more personal and enjoyable. I have taken almost every type of class they have and love the rotating course system along with set conditioning days so I can supplement my workout routines. I have seen progress on my strength and ability which was my ultimate goal. The classes are small and trainers attentive so if you ever have a question or need an alternative to an exercise due to ability or injury, they can always help you out. This gym is like a family and the people who attend are so nice. A lot of people rep the merch proudly, there are book clubs and movie nights, and people enjoy themselves when they are there. It’s a great gym and I highly recommend it.<//Review>< pics>

Everything about Allegiate is incredible - the training, the coaches, the atmosphere, the music and the members. It means a lot to me that the coaches and staff members know my name and always greet me with a smile when I come in. I've gotten stronger and smarter because not only is the training efficient, but they offer information on why we train the way we do for each block.

Cisco, Andres, Cody and all other coaches were more than welcoming and taught me new movement patterns while providing individual feedback and motivation. Other gym members were extremely friendly not to mention hard working.

Whether you're in town briefly or permanently- Allegiate is fantastic.

<Text>Allegiate is the best training program I have ever been a part of.

I emphasize program because the team (Tim, Cody and coaches) have a plan that spans months and is intended to continuously build upon itself to enable gains for all members.  Without a doubt, anyone who has been part of athletics and strength training will find him/herself at home, and fill a void no other gym or class satisfies.  Even better, Allegiate provides that while also creating an experience where fitness newcomers can also get up to speed as well.  The other members will also drive you to want to be there and push yourself throughout every class.  Coach Tim brings an incredible energy to every workout, no matter how early or late.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Time>

Everything about Allegiate is exceptional: the coaching, the facility, community-feel and programming.  The coaches and staff are very friendly (I really appreciate that they always greet me and know me by name) and motivating.  They also provide a ton of information regarding the strength program and the “why” behind what we are doing. Their attention to detail and way they think about and manage their brand is heads and tails above any other gym out there.  Being new to the south bay it has also been a great way to meet new people.<//review>

I play hockey twice a week and my game has improved drastically since I first joined Allegiate. I feel much stronger all around and my overall endurance has improved. Started going to Allegiate a month or two after they opened - my only wish is that they would have opened sooner. It’s far exceeded what I thought I could get out of a gym: variety, advanced coaching, nutrition advice, great group of people who train here, and so much more. Oh, and maybe most important, killer tunes all day everyday. Thanks to Cody and Coach Tim for opening what I refer to as my workout dream come true!</text>

<review>The highest tier of strength training you’ll find anywhere. Everything you need to get strong, you’ll find at Allegiate. Coach Caron’s strength programing is one that builds great Division 1 athletes. Now this level of coaching is finally available outside of the collegiate setting! You couldn’t ask for a better coaching staff to go along with this level of programing either. The instantaneous feedback from the coaches on details such as technique and weight progression during workouts is invaluable no matter where you are in your strength journey. They do an amazing job to make sure you’re progressing in performance every session.

The members at Allegiate create a great team atmosphere. There is something about being on a team that brings the best out of people! If you’re looking to load up that next plate, pick up those next set of dumbbells, or sprint at that next gear, these are the type of people you want to surround yourself with!

The weight room itself is filled with top-of-the-line equipment. It’s not everyday you find a gym with eleiko bars and bumper plates! When you walk in, the staff's enthusiasm alone will get you in the right mindset to lift. As you can guess, they only have the highest quality snacks/supplements available in the lounge. With Coach Caron's expertise in nutrition, you can be sure that you're fueling yourself properly for the Allegiate experience. The member’s lounge provides the perfect transition from relaxation to go time!<//review><user_name>James Nguyen</user_name>< UserId.>

<user_name>Mark Quinto< /user_name><Review>I spent time researching other places that would give me a workout community with knowledgeable and friendly staff members.  Allegiate was the place from day 1, even from my initial phone call.  When you walk in, you're usually greeted by the front desk.  People are encouraging and friendly, and, amazingly, all the trainers know what they are doing and can answer my annoying questions about how or why it works.  If you have injuries or need adjustments to the program, it is always offered.  I love everything about this place!</Review><time>1556819641508< /time>< Pics>

I came to Allegiate after doing Crossfit for years. What kept me at Allegiate was the amazing community and the intentional fitness programming. Coach Tim is best in the business with an incredible background and is a continual learner which is reflected in every workout. All the coaches are all experts and ensure clients move the right way (not to mention they know your name and are incredibly welcoming day one!).

I keep crushing previous personal bests, seeing amazing results and setting new goals. I have brought three friends to Allegiate and all have become full time members, a true testament to the community and workouts at Allegiate!< /Review>

<text>Caution to all those that enter the thunderdome: you will get the most comprehensive body and mind altering training program on the planet that pushes you to your physical and mental limits to mold the best possible version of yourself. The sheer atmosphere is so engaging and palpable taste of hard work hang in the air as you grind with other members knowing that every move is calculated by science, experience, and Coach T-Bone. These blocks are not mindless exercises thrown together to fast-track you into a wheelchair or the IR, but strategic and science based programs to engage you both physically and mentally. I left that place a better human every session because they extracted the lesser parts of me. I will forever be in their debt. I caution those that choose to embark on this life altering journey that once you commit to Allegiate, you're agreeing to see exactly what you're made of on the inside.

Been coming here for 4 months now and can't be more happy with both the results and the people I've met. Community can help one accomplish a lot and Allegiate does such a great job of building that Community. If you are in the area, I highly recommend you check it out and try the trial. It'll be worth it!</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I joined Allegiate in January after a coworker recommended it to me. At first glance, it may look like a coffee shop but make no mistake - it is an awesome training facility supported by an equally awesome staff. The people who work out here come from a variety of backgrounds - some are former collegiate athletics, some are new to working out, but everyone is all about the same thing - getting better.

Pros:
- The experienced coaches provide great guidance as you work on perfecting technique and the motivation you need to keep pushing your limits
- Evidence based programming makes sure you're constantly pushing through plateaus
- Unique culture fostering a sense of camaraderie unlike any other gym I've ever joined
- Plethora of class times that make integrating your workouts into your daily routine relatively easy
- Facilities and equipment are in great condition

Cons:
- Parking is a little limited but this issue can be mitigated by showing up on time and not too early so the folks in the previous class can clear out
- Locker room is not huge, but it's clean, has everything you need to take a quick shower post-workout and send you on your way</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I always appreciate the mentality of "showing up" and the crew at Allegiate consistently brings it every day of the week. It's a culture filled with a wealth of knowledge and continuous learning as well as an enthusiasm for what they do and why they do it. Couple those qualities with thoughtful, well rounded programming that never grows complacent, and staff that has an eye toward detail, and you've got a solid recipe for success no matter how big or small your personal goals are.  -Giddeon Massie, OLY</Text>

They have created something pretty special; from the programming, coaching, community, and support in areas like nutrition and supplementation. I workout less than before and have never felt stronger, healthier and free of any injuries. It’s such a fun environment, and if it seems intimidating, it’s really not.

Allegiate gym has been such a great experience for me! The owners and staff are very welcoming and you feel like you are a part of something that makes such an impact on your life. I have had amazing workouts and can say I leave the gym feeling so accomplished and just so proud of what I experience every time I am part of a group class. The members are such an awesome community and you don't feel like your lost in a crowd, it's a very intimate and engaging workout for every member, with a coach who's personality and experience you won't find anywhere else! I would absolutely recommend this gym and I am so happy that I am a part of it!!!!<//review>

<Text>This place has been huge for me and I 100% genuinely recommend anyone to join. Why? Because it’s a place where I just need to give my 110% effort and that’s all. I don’t ever have to think about what workouts I have to do and the reason I don’t is because I’m 100% confident in the head coach and co-owner, Tim, with his knowledge and guidance. The guidance and knowledge provided by Tim and the rest of the coaches would make this place great alone. What makes this place truly special and one that I can’t be thankful enough that someone made the recommendation to me join one year ago is the community. I know the term community gets thrown around a lot now and days but everyone, from all different levels of fitness, are all here to get after it and support others when they’re in need. The workouts are definitely not easy and push you to a level that pushes you outside of your comfort zone. What makes every workout awesome and fulfilling is because when I push myself just outside of what I can do and feel I’m about to fall short, someone is always there to help me push past it and do just enough to get me to the finish line. I’m eternally grateful for everyone at Allegiate, especially Tim and Cody, and I am excited for all my continued progress!</Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I was always concerned to work my legs again and focused so much on upper body.  Finally i joined this place and all the movements are so safe and concrete that I have been able to build my base/core again like never before and most of all i feel great, no pain, and no soreness.

The program is just so advance and more specific then the average gym and classes. And the small grouped training atomsphere really is what sets this gym apart of all the others. All the training sessions are collegiate athlete training so its well advance which gives faster results with less days of working out. The gym is always clean and tidy and its really community base with the members. I feel at home at this gym. If your looking for taking your training to next the level and tired of the same ole classes and workouts and your ready for some serious results, check out Allegiate you'll thank yourself immediately!< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<text>By far the best strength training facility / community / brotherhood (or sisterhood) I have ever trained at!

Coach Caron is the best in the business and utilizes the most effective and current training techniques to build strength, capacity, and movement competency. Whether you’re looking to learn the basics or develop into a high-level athlete, coach Caron and the staff at Allegiate will pull out your best and get you results.

If you’re looking for hard training among likeminded individuals, the latest and greatest in programming and performance, and superhuman strength development come check out Allegiate. You will not leave disappointed or without a pump!<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Allegiate is hands down the best gym I’ve ever been to. As someone who’s been to several gyms (mostly commercial), looking back I realized that I’ve always had to make compromises when it came to my workouts. This was mainly due to over crowdedness, people using their phones, poor equipment, not knowing what exercises to do for specific goals (especially with all the contradicting info on the internet), rarely would I ever get the chance to complete the workout I had in mind. But ever since joining Allegiate I don’t have to worry about any of those things, all I have to do is show up ready to put in the effort, which is just what I need before or after a long day of work.

I first heard of this gym from my buddy who’s a D1 Strength and Conditioning coach on the east coast who knew of head coach Tim Caron. So I knew right away this place was the real deal. As a member you will have access to all the top-of-the-line equipment that you often see pro-athletes use. The workout programs are all laid out for you, backed by science so you know that they’re not just throwing mud on the wall and hoping it sticks. Coach Tim and his team provide a wealth of knowledge when it comes to training and nutrition. And most importantly, they get you results! The cherry on top is the fun community atmosphere they’ve created that is a reflection of their awesome team, who collectively make a conscious effort to ensure that each member has the best possible experience when coming to the gym.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<user_name>Derek Douglas<//user_name><time>1524870298340</time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Allegiate is the best gym in the LA area (South Bay and beyond) and it is a template for how all gyms should approach their training, member community and staff.  Having experience a wide swath of gym paradigms (big box Equinox type gyms to specialized sport focused gyms to several years of crossfit) I can say that Allegiate has provided me with the most meaningful results both in strength gain and flexibility - all under the watchful eye of a top notch staff that guides each member through every work out to prevent injury and maximize results.

Training – Coach Tim is one of the most knowledgeable experts in physical fitness and strength training.   Bringing his wealth of knowledge from his collegiate experience to an accessible gym atmosphere is a game changer.  I have seen it compared to having a personal trainer by other reviewers.  This is correct in a way - but I don’t think there are many personal trainers with the depth and breadth of knowledge displayed at Allegiate.  In addition, the programming and individualized attention to detail spark meaningful and sustainable results.  Having your performance tracked during every work out, punctuated by periodic key performance indicator test, provides every member an objective standard against which to measure their progress.

Member community – A gym is only as good as it members, and Allegiate has some of the best.  Supportive, friendly, and positive, everyone is there with a common goal – get better, and have fun doing it.  It is a testament to the gym that you see the same people day in and day out, and every one of them is encouraging and helpful.  The minute you step into the members lounge you are met with enthusiasm from people that want to be there and want you to be there.  That is what drives you to show up on those early mornings you just want to hit snooze.

Staff – Knowledgeable, supportive and friendly.  The staff is there to make sure every member is getting the most out of their gym experience.  This means walking the members through the workout of the day, monitoring the form of each movement and the weight being used and interceding if someone could be performing the movement in such a way as to increase potential for injury.  Most importantly is the staff’s enthusiasm and support during every work out.  Its what helps drive you through tough sets and pushes you to perform at a higher level every time you step into Allegiate.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Absolutely love this gym. In 60 minutes you have stretching, warm up, lifting, cardio, cardio/cool down. They do an excellent job of training you the correct way of lifting to minimize the possibility of injury. In addition, they track you progress for you and keep the workouts fresh. Could not recommend a better place to train.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Seriously the best gym in the entire South Bay. Not only will you find top of the line trainers with the most qualified experience (ex-NCAA D1 coaches, trainers, and athletes) in the area but the community here makes you feel like family. Each member is there to be doing their best while helpings others and pushing each other beyond our limits. Positive vibes are strong in the air! The trainers are not only knowledge but they walk the talk to their core with the bodies and hearts of greek gods. For me the biggest improvement was not only aesthetics but my physical performance in all areas of life. From setting new PRs on all my lifts to being able to barrel down a wave much faster when I surf, Allegiate will truly change the way you move. Period.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2b4870a43771b:0x460dfeb2dd33ffca< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I've came across Allegiate after looking for a gym for quite some time after a break. I tried others similar gyms and a few crossfit outfits, and there is no comparison. I gave Allegiate a shot and immediately I was hooked. The staff is nothing short of awesome and the members are equally great. Allegiate offers un-paralleled coached class based group training with very effective workout programs that deliver results. I can attest to gains, strength, better health and possibly being in the best shape thus far. The atmosphere is excellent and always fun while maintaining a professional dynamic. Great camaraderie and dedication. Allegiate has been part of my life for several months now and I always look forward to stepping into the gym and my next class. I can't recommend enough.< /text>< response>

Allegiate is doing something on a level that is not found anywhere else - they built a program that doesn't exist and figured out a way to share it with all levels - it's beyond worth getting over there for your own mental & physical health.<//Text>

I have experience coaching athletics at the NAIA, NCAA DII, and NCAA DI levels, and this is the best training I've ever been a part of. It's a collegiate team feel that is accessible to all. I started coming here right after I moved to the South Bay, and I've made friends, made gains, and made Allegiate my home. Come on down!<//Text>

As an ex-cardio bunny, I was nervous about starting a strength training program.  What's with all this equipment?  How do I use it?  Can I really lift that?

Allegiate and their kind, knowledgeable, AMAZING staff make the program easy and fun.  Allegiate does a great job of creating a collaborative environment among their members, focusing on good form and getting stronger.  I'm super happy with my progress, from Day 1 when I could barely lift the barbell or do an inverted row to day 210 when I can deadlift over 100lbs (you'll learn to convert from kg to lb) and almost do an unassisted pull-up (my arch nemesis, lol).

If you're looking for a better way to work out, it's absolutely worth your time to check Allegiate out.  We'll see you there!</Text>

<Text>How I Put on 16lbs of Muscle In Just 16 Weeks at Allegiate Without Steroids (And You Could Too)!

When I walked into Allegiate 16 weeks ago I was a lean 201lbs, (I know because they weighed me and took my body fat % when I joined). Today when I weighed myself I'm 217lbs and just as lean! My wife has mentioned how muscular my arms and chest have become and my shorts are all too tight now because my leg muscles are busting out of them.

I've even had work colleagues ask me how I've got so big so fast and a few of them thought I went to a longevity doctor to get testosterone replacement therapy. I have not.

How did I do it?

I've just been showing up at Allegiate 3 times a week and following the world class training program and following the instructions their trainers gave me. I know it's world class because I saw the women's tennis champion Vika Azarenka training there too.

I've haven't even been following their nutrition advice 100% and have still put on 16lbs! I do wander what would happen if I follow there advice completely.

Are they qualified?

I joined Allegiate when it first opened because after walking in and speaking to Cody and Coach Tim 'T-Bone' Caron, two of the owners, I knew that this was a place for people who wanted serious results.

I'm 32, run my own business and do BJJ as a serious hobby. I wanted to make sure that I look great, feel fantastic, improve my Jiu Jitsu, stay healthy and injury free.

You see, I've been lifting weights for almost 20 years (I started at 13 years old). I've been a celebrity personal trainer in London and a Men's Fitness model. My Bachelors in Sports Science & Physiology + I'm a qualified Strength & Conditioning Coach.

Because of my background, I thought I knew a thing or two about the science of training.....until I met the Coach Tim 'T-Bone' Caron.

Coach Caron (he likes to be called Tim), is the type of strength coach that looks like a strength coach. He has THICK muscles everywhere and his grip would make you think that that he crushes baseballs for a living!

Tim was the head Strength & Conditioning Coach for the championship Football team at Army West Point. He's educated to the Masters level in Physiology and you can tell he's of top US army pedigree. He commands respect yet is extremely personable and incredibly funny!! Not only do you get an incredible workout at Allegiate you also have a lot of fun with the coaches and all the other members too.

Because of the fun and family feel, Allegiate is my favourite place to go when I'm not at home or at work.

What's it like?

This is NOT cross fit! You will NOT find people doing lots of reps with poor technique until they're exhausted, burnt out or injured. NO. At Allegiate you are giving a monthly 'periodised' training program that's built to get you strong, fit, flexible and athletic while keeping you healthy and injury free.

It's small group training, usually 4-15 members train at the same time with around 1-4 coaches training you at a time.

Its like you have a personal trainer and get to workout with your friends too!

If you want to lose fat, put on muscle, look athletic, be able to play sports without getting injured, enjoy a team feel, want to work with the best and take your health & fitness seriously Allegiate is for you.

<Text>My son was arrested last night and thanks to this company i was able to qualify for a bail bonds you don't know what i felt when my son called me and right away i got to calling places and you will be surprised of how rude people are this company really cares about customer service from the first person i talked to until the very end i had a great experience the agent was very professional and kept her mask on at all times she even provided us with small hand sanitizers which i though was cool she definitely cared and was on top of my sons release i recommend them one hundred percent.<//Text></record>

We live in Santa Clarita and my son went out to San Bernardino and unfortunately he got arrested. I was worried that I couldn't bail him out because I was so far away. I called Absolute spoke to a guy name Marco and he arrange it so it would work for me so I wouldn't have to drive up there. Very nice man and cared that I was worried. Made my experience at ease with a great price.</Review>

<Review>I was in need of a BB for a family member. I decided to use Absolute Bail Bonds and I do not regret it! Marco took great care of me! He was very understanding, polite and very knowledgeable. It made me feel at ease. They have different payment options depending on your situation. I was able to get my family member back home in no time!

The service was great, Marco really helped us out. He literally explained every detail about the process. I hadn't done this before so when you have someone leading the way it REALLY HELPS OUT. Fyi he was able to set us up with a discount. I cannot express how much gratitude i have towards this company. Thank you so much Marco and Absolute!!

PS: Also, When I went on their website and found useful information, about laws and child safety. I found it really interesting that a bail bond company was giving information on knowing your rights and family care. I added the picture that caught my attention to the article about Keeping kids safe in the water. Keep up the good work!<//Text>

We had a party this weekend and ended up having to bail out my brother inlaw. Well we have never done this before so we really didnt know what to expect. Marco was really informational!! He was also very friendly, he treated us like regular folks. I called this other place and they seemed to be having a bad day, so when Marco answered at this place it was a go. Thanks Marco, we really apprecitae your service man. Glad to see there is still people who care about the customer.<//Review>

My daughter in law was arrested, and we used absolute bail bonds to bail her out. The whole experience, beside the fact that she was arrested, was good. They were able to explian the process very detailed. When i called they found her in the system right away. I love the fact that they were able to do everything over the phone. The agent even reccomended a place to eat since we weren't familiar with the area. Very happy with the overall service! Worth checking out....fyi ask about the discounts they offer.</text>

< Review>
I went for a gel manicure, I had acrylic nails so they had to remove those prior to gel nails. Lady did a very poor job. When I got home my natural nails were sticking in my hair and by third day one nail already chipped away. Nails texture is uneven as well. My natural nails are breaking off as well. This was the whole point of getting gel nails over regular so my nails can get strong and not chip off.
I paid more for acrylic nail removal as well (over the phone they said it’s complementary with gel manicure but I give them benefit of doubt for misunderstanding) but for nail service I am not happy at all and felt like I wasted my money.< /Review>

There was a young guy there that was pretty good too but normally find guys tend to be rougher and will hurt more than the ladies. Sometimes nails last 2 weeks other times will barely make it a week it is a nice and chill place & they are more respectful of not talking to each other in language you cant understand as much as other places.</Review>< Resp>

Good work great price just didn't like the way my the paint on my feet was applied because in growing out the polish near the base of my toes seemed to make a wall against the cuticles of my toes and would scratch anything that rubbed against them.</text>

Amazing amazing AMAZING experience! I've never been so happy and talkative at a nail salon before. But the women working there are so helpful, they genuinely care for you! It's an incredible experience with amazing attention to details when it comes to manicures.<//review>

<Review>I have been going to Ucare nails bar almost every Friday for the last 6 months and I can not say enough good things about this place.
Most importantly, they are CONSISTENTLY great!!!
All of my coworkers go to this nail salon and have as many good things to say about it as I do.
Lastly, the facility is very nice and impeccably CLEAN! I never feel that any part of the facility is unkept or not clean. Again, I cannot say enough good things about these ladies and this location! Love Ucare<//Review>< Pictures>

I just got my nails done by Amy ! She was such a sweetheart and such a wonderful person. She did my nails exactly like I wanted them and was so gentle with my hands. I really appreciated the customer service and the nail service too. Great place ! I definitely recommend it !< /text>

My new favorite! They're super thorough with all the details.
They actually take the time to soak through your old gel manicure before they start the removal. And they have so many gel colors you could choose from! Pretty awesome!< /text>

Amy! Go see Amy! I needed to get my nails done for the weekend so I checked out places near my work, I found out this nail salon was only half a mile away so decided to walk over during my lunch break! I had Amy give me a gel manicure with a gold design on my ring fingers and absolutely loved it! They're a very, very clean salon and Amy paid so much attention to detail working on my nails! Will be back in the future<//text>

maybe I just have bad luck, but every time I get my nails done here, they smudge the second I have to get out my wallet to pay and I asked them to fix it and they said no. I needed a manicure for sorority recruitment and not even a day goes by without it chipping for no reason. I try to look at the bright side, but it still sucks.<//Text>

LOVE Ucare Nails Bar
Their gel manis are the best I have ever had. The polish stays perfect for more than 3 weeks and I only have to re do it because my nails have grown out too much.
My daughter and I go together and always sit together which is a bonus<//Review>

This is the place to go to get your nails done!!! I have been seeing Amy for several months now. Couldn't be more happier with the results every single time. She's a perfectionist. They all are very professional, clean, and accommodating to their clients.< /Text>

Most of the time you get in and out easy but as soon as you have one of those drivers that ignores that ERROR message at the kios telling them to go to driver assist building to get it fixed, it messes up the outgating and you end up with backed up lines while driver is waiting for the rail to fix the problem while his trying to outgate at the gate. Go get it fixed before you try and exit it won't even let you leave if your bobtail.</Text>

02-11-18 Grace the manager in the DAB drivers building was really nice polite and welcoming and really helped me as a first timer. Thank you Grace 👍👍.
The entrance is the BNSF yard that Arch road dead ends into. Enter the dead end and the road will swing right and be about 1/2 mile to the check in kiosk lanes.
Parking for the drivers checking building... After the kiosk go forward to stop sign then left to first container row then back to the building's. In front of the buildings is an area for parking. The check-in window is around the side from the employee break room.
Very modern facility. Hope to come back.
18 reviews so far totaling 4.5 stars. Seems everyone agrees this is a nice place.
Just lacking the finer signage on getting new drivers to the check in building.
Also on the way out it asks for release number, for me that turned out to be my pick up number.</Text>

<review>This place is a joke. I had to get my chassis adjusted because it was not aligned with the container. They told me to park and wait in the adjustment area so I went and waited for more than an hour. The yard guys were driving past me but no one came to help me so I had to go back to the office and tell them again until they sent someone to come adjust it.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmapID>0x8090695f94c39b1b:0x54b0ad5d01c7939a<//gmapID><date>1587717077786<//date>< Rate>

<name>Omeed Moghadam< /name><Text>I bought a 2012 BMW 6 series from Nohr's Auto Brokers and it was one of the best car sale experiences I've ever had! Nohr's is a family run business that offers many great luxury vehicles at ridiculously low prices. The BMW I purchased only had 16k miles on it, but was being sold at an amazing price! I was in and out with a new car in about 2 hours. I highly recommend Nohr's!<//Text>< pics>

<text>I visited with Pat and Molly at Nohr’s several times over the past few years before buying a vehicle with them earlier this year. Each time they were pleasant to deal with, straightforward, insightful, attentive to what I wanted, and put absolutely zero pressure on me. They made it as easy as possible and I would gladly buy another vehicle from them.< /text><rating>5</rating>< UserId.>

Apparently you thought the price was good enough to have the car inspected by one of the 3 Porsche mechanics in the area I recommended, I provided you with all the service records I have, which are extensive, including the, REAR MAIN SEAL, repair completed just 12 days earlier, so you could share them with the inspection shop.  The inspection shop found oil residue from the 12 day old repair so I took you to the shop where the RMS repair had been done.  The shop owner put the Porsche on the hoist, cleaned the residue oil off, let it run for 15 to 20 minutes to show you there was no current oil leak, the shop owner also told you the repair is guaranteed for one full year, which seemed to satisfy you. 4 new Bridgestone Potenza tires were installed on 3/03/2017 when this car had 63,542 miles, the manufactures date on the tires is 2nd week of Nov. 2016, the tires have about 7K miles on them and the car was garage kept by the local owner I bought it from. You made me a offer and I tried to make you happy by discounting this car an additional $1000, something you failed to mention in your review, but you still wanted additional discounting.  You called me today and said "My offer was still good" and asked if I changed my mind which I hadn\'t.  You also did not offer me another $250. but said you did in your review? I bought this car 12 months ago and drove as my personal vehicle for 3,100 miles before advertising it. This Porsche has all original paint and has been well loved which shows. I was straight forward with you throughout the process and now because I didn\'t meet your price demands you ding my business with an unwarranted 2 star review, this is a form of blackmail. Pat Nohr\n*according to your review this situation could have been avoided for an additional $250 discount #oddfellow'}</Resp><pictures>None</pictures><Review>I rarely leave a rating below four or five (check my reviews) but, I think this experience was one I would want others to be aware of before going to this dealer. He has good reviews online so I was led to believe this was a lot that would be professional, negotiable (within reason) and overall positive.  This is of course just my experience, I am not perfect but I do believe I am objective. If interested in saving yourself some time, read on.

While the lot is nice, when it comes down to making a deal he will dismiss or explain away findings of a vehicle inspection (PPI's you buy is normal for Porsches) as well a KBB, NADA, Hagerty Values. He will also gladly allow you to walk on a cash offer difference of 500 dollars, his call of course...its his car. Even when you as the buyer are ok assuming the risk the repair on an oil seal he had done by his friends shop that may be faulty (PPI discovered leak, his shop claims not so after wiping it away and running the car at idle for 15 min). That plus older 2016 tires (tires can be older and still have plenty of tread) he claims were put on in 2017 (doesn't matter when they were put on, just when they were cast) left enough concern to make an offer as I knew I would have to fix/change them. Its not a new car, nothing is perfect and one should not expect them to be but should a buyer and seller consider all factors to come to a final price? You make the call. He seems quite open for the car to sit for as long as it takes and that is certainly his right to do. As he said, he has to make money (we all do) and so he doesn't have to sell the car. My advice, call and get a price locked down with Pat before you go and especially before you pay for an inspection on a car like this (Porsche 996). I made the mistake of presuming we could find middle ground, I was wrong. A shame to drive a distance to have a cash offered potential sale fall apart. In the end after I called 10 days later and my offer to come up and meet in the middle giving 250.00 more was rejected did I finally throw up my hands, no reasoning with them at all. Communication had been pretty good up till I walked on 4/9 when we could not make a deal. He claims later I asked for a "discount" as well. For someone selling cars as long as he has...nobody gives "discounts" or asks for them...this is not a restaurant nor did I clip coupons to make a deal. Negotiation is just part of car buying and using data to come to a reasonable price is a common practice here. With 40+ years in business...they should know this.

In case you are wondering as the reader...I 100% agree...nobody won here, its a shame it didn't work out but for those going to his lot in the future just be prepared to pay whatever he says...ignore the data...he does. He knows best, he will be sure you know that too.  He didn't care about my experience at all either until I left a review, he certainly wanted to cry foul then. Did he in his yelp response or CarGurus want to work it out, say sorry it didn't work out? No, instead they levy baseless accusations and assertions which you should of course read, fair is fair. Accusing someone of "blackmail" for leaving a review? That implies I would remove the review if he accepted my offer, no thanks...far to many read flags say move on. When done ask yourself is that how a professional business acts when taking criticism? Any ownership or responsibility taken on his end? Not even once did he say "lets work this out" or "how can we make this right" like most any business we would do. He has a few other responses to critical reviews like this...all of them I saw...zero...zero effort to resolve with the respondent. Is this who you want to buy from?

In closing, I  would say that one should recognize that the normal sites you would use to check value (KBB, NADA etc.) or an inspection may not have a bearing on their bottom line price. Make your offer via phone and know they are firm at that number...no matter what. My suggestion, safe yourself a trip and buy elsewhere. There are plenty of better dealers out there.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

We have purchased 2 new vehicles through Nohr's. Recommended by a neighbor. Both were for my wife and she really didn't want to hassle with the dealer side-show. We told them what we want, Nohr's does all the work, and a few days later you pick it up. Done!
The pricing both times was very good. Obviously, you are  paying a commision, so you could probably get a lower price. Assuming you enjoy mud-wrestling with 4 legged animals. Some people are into that sort of thing, we're not.< /Text>

< Review>
I have to give this place a five star rating just because of how simple they made replacing my car during a stressful time. My car had just gotten totalled and I needed a good quality car with decent milage and a reasonable price ASAP. When a listing for a prius that fit my needs came up, I called, and they not only held it right then, but they got it maintained and checked out within a short period of time and had it ready by the end of the week for purchase.
Also mad props to Molly Nohr. She is a professional salesperson through and through and was fully transparent over every part of the purchase. For instance, the mechanic preparing my car injured himself pretty badly while preparing my vehicle, and she not only was fully transparent over the incident but also checked on the mechanic because I was concerned. Furthermore, she lowered the price $500 because she realized she had misquoted the price during our initial meeting and even apologized for the oversight. Honestly, I might not have noticed if she hadn't said anything. Molly displayed a high level of integrity and service, especially during a time that was really stressful when I didn't have a car, and she never made me feel pressured even when reviewing other options outside of my inquiry. Though I don't expect the car she sold me to die anytime soon, she is my first choice of dealer for when I need a new car.<//Review>

<Review>Most importantly, Patrick, the owner of Nohr's Auto Broker was simply patient and knowledgeable. Came in 10 minutes before they closed and Patrick decided to stay and showed me the car. We went on a test drive and explained each and every function the car had. Simply all I can say is that he provided excellent service and care. Also, Patrick helped me secured my new car and drove off the lot the same day. At the end of the day, Nohr's Auto Broker is an amazing family owned business as I would definitely come back again next time for a car.< /Review>< Rate>

<Date>1536440812166< /Date><Rate>5<//Rate><review>I've purchased several vehicles throughout California and I'm well informed of vehicle values, loans rates, terms, etc - effectively, well enough where I can call BS relatively quick. I have to say, Nohr's Auto Brokers was an experience that rivals the best of the best. They take pride in the quality of the automobiles on their lot - and it shows. With that being said, the difference that really stood out for me, is they way you are treated. Nohr's Auto Brokers will not try to take advantage of you - or attempt to make another dollar for the sake of making another dollar. They treat you like a friend, someone part of the family - honest and sincere - not the kind of people that are looking for every way to attempt to take advantage of you. If you're looking for a car - I would highly suggest that you check out Nohr's Auto Brokers. I'm very pleased with the entire experience and I'm certain I will be purchasing from here again.< /review>< pictures>

<review>I'm an out of state buyer and I was hesitant to buy from an out of state dealership. I flew to  CA and went for  a test drive,  I'm impressed with the quality of the vehicle and the price was good and I made the purchase.  They handled all the DMV  related stuff within 2 days of purchase, that was amazing.Pat was very helpful during the entire process.<//review><resp>None<//resp>< pictures>

<time>1535491331585< /time><Rate>1</Rate><text>Bought a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT-8 1 year ago. As soon as I drove off the lot, all interior decals started peeling off (trim plastic items that were glued back on). Within weeks, I would push the gas and nothing would happen for a few seconds. Now, 12 months later, the engine died and it's going to cost me $12K to fix. Overall, they were nice enough to deal with, but I got a lemon. Also, always used premium gas, oil changes with full synthetic on the dot, and drove normally. Take the review for what it's worth, but I'd be hesitant to buy an expensive used car and lose out on $30K dollars which is about to happen to me. I'm not going to spend $12K on a car that has other issues as well, all stuff that I'm pretty sure was known when they sold it to me. : (< /text>< Pictures>

{'time': 1535846280560, 'text': "Hi Tim, I'm sorry your are having this issue with your Jeep. When you purchased the vehicle over 15 months ago, it was covered under the factory warranty and it had 44k miles, we had a mechanical inspection performed and found nothing was needed, otherwise we would have taken it to the Jeep dealer 6 blocks from us and had the warranty work performed for free, if you suspected early on that there was a problem, I'm surprised you didn't contact us or take it to a Jeep dealer for diagnosis.  The CARFAX shows that the vehicle was maintained by the dealer prior to your purchase it doesn't show any service done since your purchase and certainly not by the Jeep dealer. I understand your frustration but after more than 15 months and at least 16,000 miles, I don't understand how you could possibly hold us responsible. I recommend that you bring it to the nearest Jeep dealer, for diagnosis, maybe they will cover part of the repair. Pat Nohr"}< /Response>

They are a family owned business with a great selection of high end used cars.  We left our existing car with them for consignment and it sold within 2 weeks!  Very friendly and professional.

We bought our 6th car with Patrick & Molly, they are always easy to work with. My husband believes in deep auto depreciation the first few years & would not buy brand new cars. So far the pricings are reasonable and fair, cars are usually well kept, worth buying & keeping. Most likely we will keep our own tradition in checking the  Nohr Auto Brokers first before our next purchase 🤗

<Review>I went to this store by chance. The owner “The Duchess,” provides a safe inclusive environment for all people. I enjoyed the atmosphere, the cleanliness of the store and the quality of the products. I was looking for bowls and found so much more. The eclectic environment paired with the customer service of ‘The Duchess’ makes for a customer for life. Great gear for Coachella!!!</Review>< pictures>

Dopest thrift store in town! Not only did hubby, sister and I all find great items, but the the vibe is so on point. The chic that greeted and rang us up (I assume she's the owner) was so super sweet and chill. The shop truely is curated to offer items that are quality, amazing treasures. Everything I saw I wanted and would love to own. This shop is a true gem! This was my first visit, I'm so stoked i stumbled across it on a google maps search!<//Text>

I just stopped in with my Mother and Sister. Omg, they have thee best inventory! The owner and staff were so welcoming and so fun to chat with. Felt like I stopped at my girlfriends closet and hung out and tried on the cutest stuff!! Wonderful prices, top of the line thrift gear, jewelry, purses, art! So much more. If you’re a thrift junkie THIS is the top of your list! I give them 5 stars all around. I will be visiting every time I come to town! ❤️ Thank you, goddesses!< /Text>

<Text>This place is AMAZING ✨
the service here is phenomenal
along with the most pleasant smell of incense wafting through the air as you step in.t They also sell them!
ALL items are washed and ready to wear no foot smell like most thrift stores. The pieces are curated lots of rare art pieces. Will be shopping again and telling friends!<//Text><Date>1617148226722</Date>< GmapID>

This place is amazing. I went up for a trip and found this gem. If you are looking for a some awesome clothes you need to go here. The owner is amazing and welcomes you with a bright smile and a hello and welcome. The place is clean and organized. I live in north county and most thrift stores here don’t allow you to try on clothes so for this place to do that it is amazing. It shows that the owner wants you to happy with your purchase. Also you can take you gently used clothes for some store credit😱... I know this place is amazing 😉 definitely will be back 😍<//Review>

<text>Love, Love, Love - Shop here!  It is a nicely curated collection for totally reasonable prices.  It is clean, smells good, and is super organized. The shop owner is super friendly and helpful.  The dressing rooms are comfortable. This upscale thrift store is more like a cool resale shop. It's like if your cool aunt or uncle had their awesome clothes closet expanded to the size of the family room and welcomed you to shop for cheap!</text>< pics>

This place smells so good and is really clean!🙌🙌🙌 Most thrift stores smell like the people who donated the clothes. 🤣 The owner is super cute with great fashion sense and literally has all the latest trends. She updates it weekly as well!👌👌 It's not overly crowded and its so well organized. Normally when I go to thrift stores I get overwhelmed...but this place feels like I'm shopping in a boutique! I am totally obsessed with this place and will be coming back soon! Hands down the best thrift store in the valley...and maybe in my entire life!🤣🤣🤣</review>

What an awesome shop! My son and I love thrift stores and we just happened to stumble upon this one. We went inside to have a look around and were instantly greeted and made to feel right at home! It’s clean and cute, like a boutique. The owner, Dutchess, is so kind. She made sure to connect with everyone that entered, including my son. For a little shop that just opened, she has really made it feel like a local spot that’s been there forever.</Text>

My instant connection with this beautiful lady turned out to have a lot more meaning then I could have imagined and I am so grateful to have met her and for her to be in my life. Please go see her and I promise you will love her and her rad shop  like I do!< /Review>< user>

Great store, I got two jackets and a pair a jeans that were a popular brand for cheap. This store gives you options that others don’t offer for a quarter of the price. The management seems very friendly and eager to help. I also went back to trade in some old clothes for store credit and was offered a generous price. Will definitely be returning and worth the drive from murrieta.</review>

This store is amazing. The owner is beyond friendly and so helpful, made me feel at home. Everything you need under one roof. Clothing is super clean and  beyond organized! Prices are great.  Love the 2 dressing rooms. So many different brands to pick from and so many styles. This is a must see when your out at Palm Desert!< /text>

<text>I happened upon this gem of a store while on a recent adventure to Angelview. This is a fantastic thrift store! Fun, funky,  well organized with really reasonable prices! Duchess was super friendly and made me feel very welcome during my visit! They carry clothing, shoes, and accessories for all sizes.  I was happy to see a plus sized section as well! Small household goods as well here! Great little store! I'll definitely be back in to see what else I can discover! They recycle clothing and offer store credit so bring your goodies! A great addition to Palm Desert!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80daff7c2ff26ded:0x6078f143d3267abd<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I can’t rave highly enough about this shop! I wish there were at least five more stars for the wonderful environment duchess provides not to mention the incredible clothes and extremely affordable prices!! Thriftology isn’t just any regular thrift shop it’s a space for anyone to come in and find something that suits them perfectly, so a huge thank you goes out to it’s wonderful owner for all the hard work she puts in to include everyone♥️<//review>

<text>This boutique thrift store has such a great atmosphere with wonderful delights to fill all your senses. The owner Dutchess is elegant, beautiful and briming with positivity, she greets everyone with a cheerful smile and a bright but classy "Hello and Welcome". If you are looking for a vintage piece or maybe a hidden goodie or some bomb clothing then this store has everything you need.

We just recently had a small event and used Rocio's catering service. The food was great. Rocio was pleasant and professional.  She also catered the event herself...🤯. We will definitely use their services again if needed.< /Review>

<Review>I ate here two nights in a row. The first night I got the 4 street tacos combo which came with a kids size drink for $4.99. The tacos were good but there was way too much lettuce or cabbage whatever it was. The next night I got the Papis favorite burrito and it was ok. If I have known they used pinto beans I wouldn’t have got a burrito. And it doesn’t say it comes with lettuce but they sure did put it in there while also forgetting to add the sour cream and guacamole that it says it comes with. As far as the meat it really wasn’t anything special I mean I could hardly tell it was there. Way to kill the craving I had for carne asada, thank you!<//Review></record>

Was my first time at this restaurant. The breakfast burrito made to order ( steak egg potato and cheese ), the green salsa was tasty and mild.
Look forward to going back.</text>

Crisp fries with flavorful meat, salsa and cheese! Definitely will come back. Same with the burrito. Will make it a point to come back. Highly recommend</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

My burrito was huge and the meat itself had a really good flavor... when you could find any of it. There was a tiny amount of asada. Also didn’t get sour cream in my papis burrito and got what I’m pretty sure was a rotten avocado. I won’t be eating here again.</review>

Wait is forever for such a small, not so busy hole-in-the-wall, they run out of certain items that are on the menu, had it happen both times we've gone. Foods pretty decent, 2 stars for the food.<//review>

<Text>Rocios catering was a perfect addition to our wedding. We absolutely loved their food and so did our guests. They were very easy to work with and we greatly appreciate all of their communication. They prepared so much food for us during our tasting and provided great costumer service. We cannot thank their team enough for being apart of our day and preparing some of the best tacos we have ever had!<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Delicious food!  Everything tastes fresh. Homemade corn tortillas for tacos. Burritos are super sized! Extremely friendly service. I would recommend ordering ahead and then picking up since it's a small drive through and they're preparing everything fresh... can take a bit longer.<//Review>< pics>

The rice was under seasoned or not seasoned at all. The beans tasted as if they had went bad. The asada was over seasoned which I thought, ok, it will make up for the lack of taste of everything else.....but the homemade corn tortillas were not thoroughly cooked, still raw. Which caused my tacos to break while eating them. Should've went back for a refund but didn't have the time. Will not be going back.

<review>They were extremely accommodating for a wedding in Clovis. They allow themselves extra time for setup just in case, which was great because of a fire on the freeway had delayed them.

<rate>3< /rate><text>Yesterday was my first time going to rocios drive thru , I wanted to try their food since it has good reviews .  Asada fries were ok , the fries were a little too hard , I also got half a dozen of the tamales . Pork,chicken cheese an jalapeño . The tamales are not that good . The green chicken one doesn’t have chicken inside same with the cheese tamal . The tamales are supposed to be stuffed with a good portion of meat inside not just the dough .< /text><gmap_id>0x80952f21cdb90093:0x982625e0b24524e< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Finally a place that has meatball soup worth paying the price for ! Meatballs are COOKED  ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
COMPARE IT TO MOONEY BLVD RESTAURANT EI TARASCCO AND ROCCIOS WINS. OH YA THE PRICE DIFFERENCE GOT THE SAME SIZE SOUP CONTAINER IS ABOUT $3-4 MORE AT EL TABASCO.

Taquitos are great also .<//text>

< Review>
Taco meat(pork) had hard small bits, not freshly prepared pork. Carne Asada Quesadilla- the meat was also like it was leftover and reheated and hard.  The homemade corn tortillas were fresh and wonderful.  Too bad the rest of the meal was not. Rocios used to be very good, hopefully they will return to their previous standard of delicious, freshly prepared food.<//Review>

Food is always so good there.
The defaulted AC did dominate our experience (I prefer the cold but this was blasting ICE from 2 directions).
Our son and my elderly mother could no longer tolerate it and we had to wrap it all up.
Before that, our waiter was mindful enough to turn off the fan above us but the restaurant manager in charge was too busy to look into what was happening with the AC.
I spoke to the main manager the next day and she acknowledged the AC situation with grace and kindness.
Though our birthday dinner could have been more pleasant, Panini is worth another chance.</text>

Food is okay for the most part, nice atmosphere, but very low on staff. Their family kabob combos are great, big portions and great price. They have opened their outdoor dining area and have limited seating on the inside as well, but wait times are insane. You have to reserve way ahead of time or else you won’t get a table and have to just order takeout. Food usually takes about 45 mins to an hour to get ready. Overall, not bad but hope they can hire more staff & work efficiently to get orders ready and be able to accommodate everyone.<//text>

<Time>1619646455656< /Time><Rate>4</Rate><Review>The food is very good. Beef kabob, basmati rice and Mediterranean salad are the best. But the worst thing is, you have to order online order, and the time is at least 50-60 minutes, and some times you can't even order, especially at evening time. So, generally it's a good network with great and healthy food, by they have to do some expansion to make it more available and responsive to consumers.<//Review>< Pics>

The food here was amazing. I had the salmon plate which was delicious. My family also had the filet minion wraps and they loved it. They kept saying how the sauce in the wrap was delicious. I love how you have many options of sides to choose from. It is also very convenient that you can order take out and have it delivered to you.</text>

I don’t recommend ordering pickup at this location for lunch. I ordered 40 minutes ahead and got a confirmation that my order will be ready at requested time. When I was there for pickup though, I was told it will take another 15 to 20 minutes. Should have been notified when receiving order confirmation, not that my lunch time being burnt! On top of this, they charge you a mandatory “tip”!</Text>

Pro's

Very good food
Decent quantity in kabob box
Two kabobs and thick
Basmati rice was light
Decent reheat-able plastic container with lid

Neutral

Comes with four eighths of pita for dipping
Few chips of green pepper

Con's

Advertised they were "open" with "23 minute delivery." Food arrived one hour later ... 37 minutes late - just kept saying "driver waiting on good." Maybe they got slammed? But I doubt it - I think they turned on their "open sign" too early and weren't prepared for an order on opening. It was one order - but still involved humus, tzazaki, and grilling veggies and making kabobs.

Small tzaziki unless you order a side.

Huge slightly grilled onion. Who eats a whole medium sized onion? Seriously...
Small couple pieces of eighths of a grilled tomato

Rice amount probably not enough for bigger eaters. For me, it was still too much, but it seems about half what other Middle East restaurants serve.

Great for COVID protection - BUT - Extremely annoying delivery bag!!!!
NOT "user friendly" to open - looks like they melt the plastic bag closed. Tear line is NOT an easy rip open. Not seniors or disabled friendly bag. Not reusable for trash.

Plastic container inside has troughs around it and food gets stuck.

Came without plastic ware.

Came without sumac.

Conclusion for me:

Other Middle East restaurants around here are equally good if not better, and more reliable for delivery time. May seem minor, but the bag annoyed me enough likely not reorder here again. Food should be easy to open on delivery.</text>

I go to this unique place every couple of days since I love the  special atmosphere that is exist in this restaurant. The staff is extremely cordial and qualified. The service is very efficient. Most important, the food they cook is perfect. I frequent often and I was always pleased. The price is decent. I suggest this restaurant to all my friends.<//Text>

<text>Rude workers as they only complain and yell at the delivery drivers that are trying to check in for to pickup the orders and ease the COVID-19 pandemic while they can’t even have more than 2 workers that help check-in the customers that are trying to order, that already made online orders as well as the delivery drivers for the delivery services they work for. They can’t even design 2 lines for check in/order or even picking up when there’s lack of innovation and consistency to the time consumed. Very poor performance and disregard to the community that’s dealing with these hard and difficult times.<//text>< user>

I've been eating here for awhile. This is a perfect example of a restaurant that due to a strong base of customers they have chosen to discontinue answering the phone. Now everyone has to order online. So, I've decided to go somewhere where they appreciate people. Rafi's beats this place hands down. The service has always been horrible here but we dealt with it cause it was close and the food was good. lately they seem to be worse. The food has been over cooked on more than one occasion. I'll just say that's the beginning of the end when you start showing favoritism only to online customers who've never even been inside your establishment over people who have ate there for years. Well your curse will be my blessing. Another company using covid to block the rush instead of dealing with it. Thanks it was a fairly good run.</Text>

I ordered a Dark Meat Boneless Chicken with rice, Shirazi Salad, babaganoush and it came with garlic sauce and pita. My order was via google takeout therefore I didn't have to deal with waiting in line. From the looks of it you order at the counter then find a seat. They have outdoor patio seating which looked really nice on a sunny afternoon.<//Review>

Great option for family takeout, vegan friendly! My family orders from this place since some of us are vegan and others not, we all eat happily. The tofu kabob is SO good, as are the falafels and romaine avocado salad.< /Text>

Great food and friendly staff. While I'm sad it's not buisiness as usual they are doing a great job shifting to such a heavy focus on take out orders.</text>

We have been back several times since my last review and were happy with everything but our order last night was very skimpy! We ordered takeout. Maybe that was our mistake! I ordered the Salmon Salad which I’ve always liked. Yet, when I open the container I noticed only a few pieces of salmon! 2.5 ounces to be exact! I had to pull out my kitchen scale to weigh them. This was shocking on a $14.00 almost $15.00. Have they changed owners??</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2claR-dfJGvrRrTWqw2pOksNp1Geuyl2tKLHC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9iN2soZd9u3P7eBFz6mJmHrwx-7JiwKZPr-zA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

As of 01/22/2021, I have  placed two orders recently and I was pleased with overall experience. My orders were on point. Food was delish. Customer service was excellent. Keep it up 😀</Review>< pics>

< Review>
we ordered family meal with chicken kabobs and with 1 tofu kabob substitute for me. the tofu was placed in the same container as chicken and when i got home i found that it was laying inside the chicken oil and juice. i called them and they wanted me to stop my entire family’s meal, repackage everything, bring it back (25 minute drive), just to replace the one tofu skewer. i didn’t get to eat dinner since i obviously don’t eat meat and didn’t want to interrupt my entire family’s dinner to replace my one kabob. i understand it’s covid times and things are hard but i was told this is their normal policy for family meals. i was disappointed that better customer service was not provided (i.e. refund, voucher, apology, etc.)</Review>

<review>Always amazing, great food, great service, huge portions, great prices. Staff and kitchen has done better than most since covid hit. So many places have had a hard time keeping food on par with pandemic restrictions, panini has not. We order curbside at least once a month from them and it’s always perfectly packed, nothing missing, tastes exactly as good as pre pandemic.< /review>< pics>

Visited on a Sunday morning with a large party of 11. We were seated quickly (not too busy at 11am) and were tended to quickly. The service was excellent and food was good. Prices are not too bad and the portions are worth it. I had Steak and eggs, the steak was in kabob form which I did not expect ( didn't see that mentioned in the menu) but it was tender and delicious. It came with roasted potatoes (could have been cooked more but I did not specify so they were OK) and Organic eggs ( I ordered over easy and they were perfect).  They serve Lavazza coffee which was excellent, I really enjoyed that. My family ordered Kabobs of all kinds, most of which I tried and they were all very good. The only thing I did not care for was the side of bacon I ordered. It looked crispy but was a bit tough and chewy, and just a little bit over seasoned. We ordered 2 pieces of Baklava and a side of Ice cream. The ice cream was good, the Baklava was a bit sweeter than we like, but still very good. Overall great experience, I would give it 4.5 stars if I could, I highly recommend this place.<//Text>

I would give them zero star, because they don't value time 60% of online orders are late, all of take out/delivery  Kebabs are put out side on a shelf with 2 cleaning fans on top of the Food, which it makes the food cold. And the Kebob taste is gone when it arrives to customer home.< /Text>

During a global pandemic, we expect restaurants to uphold the highest standards for COVID-19 Compliance. This is exactly what I did not get during my last visit, and now it has me and my family scrambling for a COVID-19 test.

We ordered the Family Meal for 2. Chicken skewers were good, but the bulgur pilaf rice smelled and tasted off. We contacted PKG and a manager, Connie, requested that we return the food for a replacement. First of all, this got me thinking, in the nine to ten months that we have been in a GLOBAL PANDEMIC, this is the first time I have EVER heard a restaurant request to have the food brought back. The staff does not know where that bag has been, what particles it has on it, and if it is contaminated or not. Second of all, why does PKG desperately want customers to bring spoiled food back during a global pandemic? Is it to check to see if I ate half of the rice? Is it to check to see if I am lying about the quality of the food in an effort to get a free meal? What is Panini Kabob Grill insinuating towards customers by violating a MAJOR COVID-19 COMPLIANCE STANDARD just to check the validity of the customer's complaint?

I came back the next day and asked to speak to a manager, and Jesse (I believe) was quick to assist. Before I handed back the food, I asked if the PKG management staff has been put through COVID-19 Compliance training. He says that they have, but that does not have me convinced. He informed me that they do not reuse or do anything with the food other than throw it away. This, to me, was very strange. While I did see the majority of the staff wearing gloves, it really shocked me that a manager was going to take my potentially contaminated food with bare hands, and take that food back into the premises, putting the entirety of the PKG staff AND CUSTOMERS in jeopardy through potential transmission.

The general manager, Gloria, was quick to dismiss the situation and explain that it was simply a company policy. So, Panini Kabob Grill, is it company policy to do what no restaurant does during this terrifying time and put its staff and clients in jeopardy through relaxed COVID-19 Compliance Standards by taking food back? How do I know that the staff is actually following these "guidelines"? Why bring potentially contaminated food back onto the premises if it is going to be discarded?

I no longer feel safe supporting or recommending Panini Kabob Grill to any of my friends and family, because I worry for their safety during this COVID-19 pandemic. I hope this review will shed light on the irresponsible safety standards that Panini Kabob Grill strongly stands by, and potentially save you and your loved ones from being infected with this deadly virus.<//Text>

So, Panini Kabob Grill, is it company policy to do what no restaurant does during this terrifying time and put its staff and clients in jeopardy through relaxed COVID-19 Compliance Standards by taking food back? How do I know that the staff is actually following these "guidelines"? Why bring potentially contaminated food back onto the premises if it is going to be discarded?

I no longer feel safe supporting or recommending Panini Kabob Grill to any of my friends and family, because I worry for their safety during this COVID-19 pandemic. I hope this review will shed light on the irresponsible safety standards that Panini Kabob Grill strongly stands by, and potentially save you and your loved ones from being infected with this deadly virus.< /Text>

I celebrated my graduation today in this gorgeous place. Well we passed a delightful evening and the venue was no doubt one of the reasons for that happy celebration. The crew  collaborated in a pleasant way, the food was yummy and my buddies were extremely  cheerful. We shall definitely visit again for more events. thanks very much.<//Review>

Balgur was cold I brought it up the young waiter was very polite offered to get me a new portion. It took a long time it was cold too I asked if he could nuke it! Which he did but by that time I had finished most of my meal. In fairness to the waiters they were very busy and running around crazy! So I blame the management for not staffing adequately.< /text>

Definitely one of the top Mediterranean restaurants that you should try in Los Angeles! Beef Kobideh and Chicken Kebab with Biryani Rice is the bomb!!! They say the combos can feed two to three people but if you're famished, just have it for yourself! Hahaha</review>

Ordered the appetizer sampler for delivery. Was extremely disappointed that their menu says it comes with caprese (even has a picture), but they gave me cucumber and tomato "salad" instead. That being said, I'd eat their edamame hummus from a shoe.<//Text>

Probably the best beef and chicken kabob I ever had.
Large portions, food is made fresh.  Their freshly squeezed lemonade is to die for.  very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Prices are reasonable with ample parking.
I feel very comfortable recommending this restaurant to my family and friends.</text>

Great food. In a loud and crowded restaurant.

They come hand in hand... you make good food, a lot of people want to eat it.

Panini Kabob Grill makes great food!

Hummus trio was very good. Although in a blind taste test I don't know if I could tell a huge difference between the three.

Shrimp salad was very tasty. Shrimp were big, cooked to perfection and flavorful. Although only 3 of them. Dressing had a great lemony zing.

Steak kabob was excellent. First, I like that it is cooked as a kabob, but the skewer is removed when plated, allowing the customer to eat without risk of food flying. Meat was cooked correctly and had good flavor. Grilled onions were also on point. The tomatoes and bell peppers were meh. But I am not a big cooked tomato fan.

Lastly, the banana bread pudding was everything I was expecting. Great blend of banana flavor with a sweet bread pudding. Really good.

Waitstaff were pleasant, not memorable, but not bad.

Venue is standard, clean and loud.<//Text>

<rate>5</rate><text>Panini Kabob Grill is amazing for all meals. Their kabob entrees come with rice, veggies & a side salad. Their portions are ginormous & their kabob meats are not dry. For breakfast, I highly recommend the $19.95 breakfast special, which comes with French toast, sausage, bacon, potatoes, and scrambled eggs. It's an amazing platter with so many good choices. Best part? Can easily be split among four people with plenty left. They also have $2.95 brunch mimosas. What a deal!< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Use to order at least once per week. Last 2 times very disappointed with both the size and the quality. Kabob meat is poorly seasoned and lula is undercooked. It looked like a broken leftover parts. It was definitely undercooked since the meet looked like it was boiled not grilled. I have paid almost $40 for 2 orders and literally trashed them. I piece of ungrilled onion and spoiled tomatoes.
Come on guys.
Very disappointed and unsatisfied.
Will not go back again.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

What a fantastic find!   Now in the spot at 30th and Los Angels that used to be Bernal Heights Pizzaria, Shish Ke Baba is the home of excellent Turkish food at a reasonable price.  This is way better than Turkish fast food, with the big hunk of pressed meat.  This is a real restaurant, whose dishes' subtle yet perfectly balanced flavors are the signature of a 40 year chef who has passed his recipes and techniques down to his children.</text>

Service was good. If you're going to split the bill, you need to tell them ahead of time. You can't use 3 cards to pay; they'll split the check for you instead. Had the lunch special beef kabob, one skewer. It was pretty good. Seating was tight. Place in general is small and tight.

This restaurant going crazy... You have to wait in line about 20 minutes no matter if you want to order something or even to pickup online orders... All people including delivery drivers have to pass through 20-min line. 30-40 bags with orders peeled outside and they can't handle it fast.< /Review>

If you go during rush...you will wait a while. The salmon kabob is so worth it if you like fish. I always take bulgar.....its very very tasty and does not bloat me like rice. Get a hummus trio if you are going with friends to enjoy at the table.</Review>

nice place for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Not expensive,  good for families.  delicious food. Good discount for party order.  $19.99 plus tax  for chicken kebabs,  rice and salad for 2 people is the best deal, highly recommended.  Bread pudding for dessert is good</Review>

<text>Love panini kabob. This restaurant is located in a huge shopping center with plenty of parking. We come here at least once a week. This place has too many servers in compare to the size of actual restaurant. That means you will always get the best service here. My favorite server is "Nina". She gets my order right all the time. Also very patient when taking my order and this makes me very happy every time i go to panini kabob. The overall quality of food is great. Always fresh and healthy.<//text><name>Rose Stone<//name>< userid>

<review>Panini Cafe restaurants provide delicious food.

Management, please notify your servers that they are violating the 2019 California regulation that prohibits restaurants from giving patrons straws without a request. My friend and I were given straws even though we hadn’t requested them. The law is a very small step to try and save our planet. Please oblige.</review>< Pics>

The ambience is energetic, this place gets packed. There is a good amount of space though between tables. There are families all around. Once you walk in there you will get the sense that this is a family restaurant. The food is healthy and delicious. I had the hummus trio which was tasty especially the regular kind, the pita bread is soft. The lentil soup was really delicious and the Mediterranean salad, bulgur pilaf and chicken kabob. I'm going to be regular from this point on.<//Text>

<Text>This is the first time we have been this restaurant. We expected they can provide good customer service and good food, cuz this is one of the good name chain store.

Today I want to complain the customer service.

We went there and had a seat at 4:30 pm. We had been waiting over 10 minutes ish , no one came and asked us. We had to ask a service then we can get a drink, even only need a coke. We also need to find a waiter/ waitress to order food. I want to say at the moment the restaurant was not busy. They had more then 10 waitresses were working. No one came to us and ask us what we want to order. We seems got abandoned. The tables after us already had food. They all came later than us and ordered later than us received their food and drinks. They got service right away, yet we still setting right next to them. We kept waiting for our food over 25 minutes. They brought us food after we complained.

I can not believe it happened to us in a good name chain store. Very disappointed. I would never recommended this location to my friends！< /Text>< Pics>

I absolutely love, love panini kabob grill! First of all, I love their lunch and dinner options in terms of kabobs, salads, etc. but I've also become a recent fan of their breakfast!

So this time my friends and I split the breakfast combo. It's enough to feed 3-4 people and includes French toast, sausage, bacon, eggs, and potatoes for only $20!

We also tried the open face smoked salmon which is amazingly delicious and I would order this every time I come here for breakfast if I could!

Can't say enough good things about this place. The quality of food is amazing and it really shows in not only the presentation of the food but the taste< /review>

Delicious kebabs, healthy food and very reasonably priced. Definitely try their family platter which is one of my faves. The koobideh is ok but the chicken is great and flat iron steak is good. Good quality food. One star off just because sometimes they mess up on deliveries.</Text>

Everything was fantastic! The Kebab was the best ever. The desserts were off-the-charts good. Very busy. Which is a good sign because everybody seemed to be loving it. The brown rice was great, the salad was delicious.</Review>

I love this place!! My go to meal here is the beef koobideh kabob and banana bread pudding for dessert. I will go out of my way to eat that banana bread pudding. It usually gets very busy in the evenings, so that may be something you want to account for.< /text>

<Text>I had the romaine avocado salad with chicken and it was good, but not great. The problem is I have been to the original one in Beverly Hills and the quality there is always on point. I know with expansion some quality can suffer and unfortunately the chicken on my salad was so overcooked and dry that it was not enjoyable. The salad was good, just like the original one. The other thing was the pita- it tasted a bit old like they made it yesterday. Although it was warm, it didn't taste fresh like it was made the same day. For those reasons I had to lower the stars, but I hope with a quality check, all those pain points will improve. I'll still go to the original Panini grill in BH.<//Text>< pictures>

I really enjoyed the food but was really hungry. I was able to ignore what we thought was old soup and old dressings. But the hummus and pita was great and I loved my sandwich<//Review>

One of our favorite neighborhood eateries. Mediterranean menu has a wide range of delicious options, including excellent vegetarian dishes, and the dining room is cheerful and comfortable, which makes it a nice place to take guests & family. We love all the kabob plates--  salmon, tofu, chicken and beef, all served with delicious grilled vegetables and a wonderful, flavorful bulgher pilaf. The vegetarian lentil soup is truly delicious. Salads are fresh and tasty. Prices are reasonable, portions are generous. The service is usually pretty good.<//review>

Fresh, full sized, delicious salads and multi-layered sandwiches. They don't skimp on the good stuff. Pesto chicken panini and the date salad is a wonderful lunch to split & share. This place is on my "cravings" list!< /review>

The steak kabob plate was great! The problem was the waiter Oscar, he was unattentive until I asked for something again and he was sarcastic. He brought it to the table and then waved his arms like "There are you happy?"then upon leaving he told my boyfriend that he was a lucky man! Ewww! Talk about uncomfortable 😝< /Review>

Ordered family pack for pickup. portions were smaller  service was not friendly and not accommodating. Chicken pieces were lost amongst vegetables  rice barely was enough for 3 people  and the salad was salty...they used to be much better, but all in all not a good dining experience anymore.</review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>Favorites are the cauliflower and the pig's face. I hear it takes months to get a reservation here. My boyfriend and I were determined to eat there. We went accross the street and went to a brewery while we waited for this place to open. As it did, we were seated without a reservation. However, the waitress told us we had to leave before the reservation party showed up (one hour later). That was fine for us so we go to taste the cauliflower. I want to make this everyday if I can for dinner. It tastes light, healthy, and delicious. One meal I will not forget is the pig's face. It has an egg on top. Seriously, the combination of the yolk to the pig sets off multiple taste receptors in my mouth going off all at once. Get it, you won't regret it!< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Placed an order through grubhub, order was confirmed and then after wasting 30 minutes of my time canceled over the phone. I understand it's busy, but if you don't have the time to meet the demand call immediately don't waste peoples lunch time.< /Text>

<text>OMG, serves hormone-free and antibiotic-free meats! An Oasis in the desert. Delicious, and for a good price. Fresh salads and tastey dips. The coffees are amazing and service is friendly. Seems to have a lot of regulars. Brown rice option and proudly advertises use of free range chicken eggs...a good sign. Also the take out containers think are reusable microwave and dishwasher safe. A pretty thoughtful restaurant!!!< /text>< Rating>

The food is delicious but ever since covid I've been trying to do curbside pickup over here and they never bring it to my car I always have to get out of my car so that's why I'm giving three stars I don't know why they offer curbside if you still have to get out of your car stand in line to grab your food. Definitely seems like their short staffed over there.<//Text>

The waiting time was too long, the service was poor and there was a bug in the salad. When complained to the manager, she responded  “SORRY!”

We are regulars at Aliso Viejo panini and there’s no comparison for the service and the quality of food between these two restaurants.< /text>

So, Panini definitely isn't bad, but I've never been wowed with anything here. Pretty much, it's a safe, healthy, and convenient choice for lunch downtown.

Everything is good, but the chicken skewer's are always a safe bet. Get the avocado salad on the side and rice pilaf (or sub grilled veggies if you feel like being healthy). Oh and don't be a baby and park at the Ralph's.<//Review>

< review>
Great coffee wonderful staff warm environment. So glad to see awesome coffee in Mid-City/South Robertson, an area that's a bit short of options when it comes to coffee. Wish I caught wind of Paganini Cafe when they were in the midst of their Kick starter campaign, but I'm going to do my part to support this small, authentic business by making it my go-to coffee place forever.</review>

I will have you judge based on what I will share with you.  These guys used to have chicken kabob and salad for $8.99 then they raised it to $9.99 and a good portion.  This time (and for the last time) I get home after paying $13 plus tax (almost $15) and I ended up cooking at home. They did the same with their family combo for pick up which used to be $29 and now is $40 for the same food; I think once they create customers they raise the price and cut the portion.  Here is my $14 chicken shish kabob which didn't even fill up the plate . Very very cheap and disappointing.< /Text>

Great food, especially the family dinner for $29.95, for a dollar more, exchange one chicken kebab (very tender and tasty) for 2 Koobida so you get 4 skewers. For dieting, they will exchange rice for an extra salad (gives you 3 big salads). Feeds more than 4 people. We get it for two and take home enough for a few more meals.< /review>

<Review>They mislead people by offering something and serving something else. They don’t explain clearly about what they are going to serve. Their customer service is horrible. They did the same with their family combo for pick up which used to be $29 and now is $40 for the same food; I think once they create customers they raise the price and cut the portion.
If I could give this place no rating, I MOST DEFINITELY WOULD!!!< /Review>< Pics>

<review>FOOD IS ALWAYS OK EVEN GOOD, SOMETIMES THE RICE IS COLD BUT THE STAFF ARE PRETTY NICE ABOUT GETTING YOUR ORDER RIGHT.
I HAVE SEEN SOMETHING THAT MADE MY SKIN CURL . THIS DID HAPPENED TWICE, LAST TIME WAS LAST FRIDAY AT ABOUT 8:50 PM. I WENT TO THE BATHROOM, NOTICED THE PERSON IN THE NEXT STALL MUST BE AN EMPLOYEE BECAUSE HER APRON WAS SPREAD ON THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF HER ON THE TOILET, AS THIS WAS NOT BAD ENOUGH, I HEARD THE DOOR WITHOUT HER WASHING HER HAND. I SCREAMED YOU SERVE FOOD AND NOT WASHING YOUR HAND. SHE SAID " I AM NOT A SERVER I AM AT THE CASH REGISTER"  .
I WENT TO THE MANAGER AND VOICE MY CONCERN AND SHOWED HIM THE GIRL WHO WAS IN THE BATHROOM. ALL HE DID AND SAID WAS, THEY BE MORE CAREFUL.
THE SAME SITUATION HAPPENED COUPLE MONTHS EARLIER, THAT GIRL SAID SHE WAS GOING TO WASH HER HANDS SOMEWHERE ELSE. THE MANAGER AT THAT WAS A DIFFERENT ONE BUT THE SAME-O- SAME=O . FIRST TIME I ASKED THE MANAGE TO HAVE SOMEONE FROM THE HEAD QUARTER TO CALL ME BUT IF YOU GOT A CALL SO DID I.    .</review>< Response>

I can't comment on most of the menu because I always order a salad or the chicken kabob entree. The meals I have ordered have always been good. What would make them better is to have a side of naan or lavash or a small side of yogurt/cucumber.<//Text>

<text>This place is a gem. Truly authentic: not your usual bacon omelette, they'll put artichoke and prosciutto that really tastes like Italian produce. With fresh fruit. They'll ask whether you want your toast multiseed or sourdough. Not your usual bottled orange juice, but freshly squeezed.< /text>< Pictures>

The food is great! Service? That's a different story.  The server we got was rude, arrogant and offensive! He should learn some customer service manners!  If you're all about the service, make sure you ask for the best server or you will simply be disappointed and not enjoy your food. The times I've been here, the service has not stood out - you gotta come to this place for the food, not the service.  They also don't accept RSVP for large parties (*we were more than 12.)</review>

Went here a while ago for an early dinner. Good food and friendly service. Seemed like like a Greek restaurant than a panini place, though they did have paninis and they were good. Seemed like they were going through a type of shift in management or vision, though that did not detract from the food or the service.<//Text>

<Review>Day special was plate with Kabab and chicken skew small salad and rice.
All together come to be a very large portion , ate there twice at lunch time and both cases finished only a little more than half.
Meat was tasty, salad ok, and so was the rice.
Price ok though not cheap, the plate with soda came to almost $21.
Have sitting table in and out, tried both and both were ok.
Easy parking.<//Review>< Pics>

We were there last night. We ordered kabob. But one of the Kabobs was burnt and was not eaten at all. Service was also not very good.< /Text>

<Text>Let me start of by saying how unprofessional the manager Alex is. He didn't even bother to greet us and sat us by some obnoxious couple that was arguing the entire time throughout our visit. He was aware of the situation but didn't bother to change our seating. Also, it was beyond rude to watch him bring out his personal cell phone while on duty. To top it off, my romaine avocado salad was way too sour. I didn't even bother touching my salad. If I could give this place no rating, I MOST DEFINITELY WOULD!!!< /Text>< rating>

Excellent service, best kabobs I've had in a long while. Large portions, falafel was also excellent. The  panini sandwiches are not traditional paninis at all, barely grilled on a grill, din't care for them at all. Everything else I've tried has been excellent.< /review>

The food quality and service is not good.
They don’t care about the customers.
Food tast is not good.
A glass of lemonade purred on the floor and they just looking.

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>The food usually good at Panini kabob. This time we got pilaf rice instead of the white rice. The Pilaf rice was not coocked enough. The rice was too hard and chewy. They need to steam it for much longer time before serving it to their customers but the chicken shish kabob was delicious as usual.< /Text><user>115568553569399483786</user></record>

<Review>What a waste!  Nice location, good menu, horrible food and horrible service!!
We had to wait for 20 minutes to get water and about 15 minutes to get the bill.  Had to ask 3 times to get extra lemon for ice tea. I ordered Fallafal platter, the Fallafal were cold and hard as rocks!  Literally asked the waiter to get me a hammer to break it.  The waiters reply - that’s how Fallafal are!!  Will never go there again!!< /Review>< pictures>

It's great Meditteranean food with a nice cozy atmosphere and good prices. The place is practically packed all day but the wait usually resides in the 10-15 minute range for me when they tell me 20-30 minutes. I wouldn't recommend the peach iced tea. Parking is fairly easy as most of the plaza is dying besides the food there.<//Review>

<UserId.>105358773040114616774< /UserId.><text>Great mediterranean style restaurant. We have visited a couple of times this year and have received excellent service each time. It is usually quite busy in both afternoon and evenings, we averaged 15 min wait for seating which is fine. The food is delicious and healthier than most places. I tried the chicken kabob with bulgar pilaf and greek salad, serving size is more than enough for one person. Also, the hummus trio is good! Look forward to visiting again in the future.<//text><response>None< /response></record>

<Review>Eh, nothing wrong with this place. The portions were actually pretty large, and the chicken on the kabob was cooked very nicely. A tad bit bland for my taste. Initially i was a little put off by the prices, but once i saw the portion sizes, my concerns were put at ease.

This place just didn't thrill me at all. I just wasn't really havin' it from the beginning. Though in their defense, i've had a rough week, so maybe they deserve a second chance some time.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Went in Sunday night food was dried up , salad was old and incomplete on top of that when I asked several time to remove bell peppers before cooking because I have ALLERGY To peppers . I got very sick because they lied ( I’m guessing since they where dried up also , they give me old ones and removed the pepper off of my plate ) this is not a joke , I almost died!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

This location is by far the worst location of Panini Cafe. Terrible food. The dish was dirty.  The kabobs were old and taste horrible. I talked to the manager showing him the dirty dish,  and he just said these are only fingerprints! I love Panini Cafe, but I definitely never recomend this location of them. So disappointing.<//Review>

The quality has gone way down. This used to be my go to for kabobs but the last 3 times I have had the meat completely charred on one side, and the meat is not as tender as I recall it being. Needless to say I gave this place three tries and STRIKe theyre out!!! I will not be coming back to this location in which I used to frequent quite often</Text>

I really love this place.  I used to go to the one in westwood village weekly when I worked there.  They have the best lunch specials.  Their kabobs are filling and the salad and rice that comes with it are also really good.  Their salmon is also delicious.  I've never actually had a panini here just the kabob plates but friends have also liked their sandwiches.  For 9.99 it's a great bargain for really good food. (chicken kabob special!)<//text>

<Text>Excellent!  Was just expecting a run-of-the-mill panini place, but there's much more to choose from.  Wide range of Mediterranean food.  Had the koobideh and chicken kabobs, both of which were great.  Very impressed.<//Text>< UserId.>

Then he walked away I guess he didn't care whether or not we stayed.  So we decided to take our business some where else and never go back.

<date>1419274269455<//date><rate>5<//rate><text>Great tasting food basically sums up Panini Café. This is one of a number of locations in Southern California, serving a mix of Italian and Mediterranean foods with American fare breakfast meals as well. I had a chance to try the Chicken Pesto grilled sandwich which was a little dry but overall tasted good. What really tasted delicious was their Koobideh kabob entrée; though it isn’t listed as “Highly Recommended” or “A Must”, I’d definitely give it a try. Pricing is more than fair considering the large portion sizes on their Mediterranean entrees. This restaurant is located in a large shopping plaza which has plenty of convenient parking.</text>< Pics>

<Review>I am changing my review about this place, they were good in beginning but they are getting really bad, like tonight i came to victory location and i got here at 9:05 pm and now is 9:44 and i am still waitting for my food. Also in glendale location, i was having lunch and accidentally there was lots of salt in one side of my food and i got a tribble headache after.<//Review>< pictures>

The food looked good and I tried it out since my company moved to the area... big mistake! Bland overpriced food, slow service, and apparrently overwhelmed by a party of 5. The bread had the faintest grill lines and was by no means a panini.< /Review>

<review>This place caught my eye, and the service was as good as any decent service should be. The food however is another story. I ordered a tuna melt which, to my surprise, was the fishiest and most unfamiliar tuna sandwich I've ever had (not enjoyable). I got the servers attention to ask him if I could trade for something different, He had no problem allowing that so I ordered something simple, reliable. A turkey club panini, also no good. Turkey club from here is dry and the avocado was tough.

The worst thing about it was the bread. I was expecting a panini-pressed style sandwich. The bread I got on both sandwiches had blackened grill marks on both sides, of both slices of bread. It's as if they just panini pressed the dry bread to a crisp and then tossed the ingredients between.

They were friendly and the decor was nice and I felt bad because I've never returned food. My girlfriends dish was delicious (chicken kabob). I'm here on behalf of good panini's everywhere saying this place needs to be put in check.  Still tipped the nice waiter<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>The resturant was clean and had an open feel to it. The server who helped us seemed as if they wanted to be somewhere else.

The chicken kabob was nice and tender. The Basmati rice was and fluffy. The sald came out fresh. All the food was plentyfull. We had three kinds of Hummus and all wrlere good.

The Salmon kabob was just ok.

The food overall was good but nothing spectacular that would rate a 5. A fair rating would be 3.7 so I rounded it up. The seasoning is on the light side.

Tplace is good for families and they have out door seating.< /Review><Rate>4< /Rate><Pics>None</Pics><Gmap_id>0x80c29c1ea97a353f:0x3789a9490dabba3d<//Gmap_id>< resp>

i tried to order on line but it's not available, I got promo code which they offer 25% off but they trick you  you pay full amount charge if you order by phone, this is scheme and it's not good business that they set up.</review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) Excellent kebab, I enjoyed it, unfortunately the falafel and chickpeas are not so recommended. Detail, the chickpeas were just a little too watery, the other chickpeas I took were sour with a fermented taste as if it had spoiled and I had not eaten from it. The falafel was dry and not spicy enough for my taste. Overall the meat is good, the chickpeas are fine, the special chickpeas were not fresh.

קבב מעולה, נהנתי ממנו, לצערי הפלאפל והחומוס לא כל כך מומלצים. אפרט, החומוס היה בסדר רק קצת מיימי מידי, החומוסים האחרים שלקחתי אחד מהם היה חמוץ עם טעם מותסס כאילו התקלקל ולא אכלתי ממנו. הפלאפל היה יבש ולא מתובל מספיק לטעמי. סך הכל הבשר טוב, החומוס בסדר, החומוסים המיוחדים לא היו טריים.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>
