<text>Jury selection takes three times as long (three separate days with different groups) so they can social distance. Everyone is to remove or pull down your mask when speaking so the court reporter can hear and see the movement of your lips.

<review>Pretty funny how they love asking people to go to jury duty when they have NO means of transport other than by bus yet say that's no problem. This place ain't close by and it can get pretty dangerous in this area! 10/10 will not live in Bakersfield ever again<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Spoke w/ a gal named Maritza. I am a nurse that is travelling to fight COVID-19 on the east coast. I needed documentation and was told it could take up to two weeks to get it to me. Once I explained that I needed these documents to continue my efforts out here I was helped almost immediately. Situations like this make me proud to have come from this county. Thank you, Maritza and The Kern Superior Court.</review>< pictures>

The Law Library never answers the phone. Very unprofessional and uncommitted. And there’s only one working elevator. The second elevator has been out of service since God only knows how long. The ladies up on the 3rd floor in the Law Library are helpful but honestly they can put a little more effort into helping people with documents.< /Text>

< Review>
Feel the thunder in the sky and the lighting when it strikes,
Flashing light, that's your life, there's no way you can escape.
No more time to wonder why, no more evil paradise,
Fear the light, feel the light, and it's way too late to pray.
Run away, now run go hide, you can run you can try to survive,
But I doubt it so seriously, you stay alive.
Now it's over, and it's time for our lord oh Jehovah to call in his soldiers,
Revealing the revelation and eliminating no Magog.
And there's no time, no time, no time, no time for repenting
And there's no time, no time, no time for you to be tripping,
Think of the murders, people you murder (people you murder)
So may you rest(rest) in (in) peace!

[Chorus:]
And it won't be long, and it won't be long, and it won't before
Babylon (Babylon), the great has fallen (fallen) and the soldiers go marching in. [x2]

[Verse 1:]
We been living in this world so crazy it's got
A whole lot more crazier now
Cause now we're barely making it and dead we can't escape it
So the only way to face it and is all together take it
Frustrated can vanish your mind
When you feel like grabbing that nine
And gotta do some drastic to be with your family
Look I ain't gotta tell that's the living it is that real,
And never really did a thing for us
And never really sat down and explained to us,
That wouldn't be the same for us
And trying to make a living would be dangerous,
Now we're sitting on the block just starving
While we watching all the big dogs balling,
Begin your life again stars starts falling,
So we wait until our God come calling,
Swing low, swing low
Take me away from here please know
That we're living in the last of the last days
And when he comes and he catch you in your bad ways!

[Hook/Chorus:]
And/said it's too late to apologize, too late to apologize, it's too late,
It's way too late to say sorry too late! [x2]

And it won't be long, and it won't be long, and it won't before
Babylon (Babylon), the great has fallen (fallen) and the soldiers go marching in. [x2]

[Verse 2:]
If it's not around the corner, but it will creep up on you,
To get it on up on you
Murder rappers before your eyes and if you can be down to ride,
The middle 187 homicide, truly given apologize.
Too late to pray to God when stars start falling,
Too late to try to interpret the writings on the wall,
It's way too late to pray, too late
Tribulations to great for you to escape... !
It's the end of the world and still ain't got no satisfaction
Living demand, but how I just can't phathom,
But now I'm sick of knowing once you get that ransom (ransom).
And it won't be long, and it won't' be long, and it won't be long before
The world is seeing by the king of the north
And makes great peace, but it's really going to be war (war, war)
Government come tumbling down we never need them no more (more, more)
It's way too late to say sorry too late!

And/said it's too late to apologize, too late to apologize, it's too late,
It's way too late to say sorry too late! [x2]

And it won't be long, and it won't be long, and it won't before
Babylon (Babylon), the great has fallen (fallen) and the soldiers go marching in. [x2]</Review>

<Time>1562106162659</Time><rate>1< /rate><text>Kern County Judge David Lampe ruled on the side of bigotry and opened the flood gates for the dismantling of Civil Rights. He minimized the protection against discrimination to "accessibility to the marketplace". He took what people had fought and died for and reduced it to a mere perk of capitalism. He ruled that a bakery can use deny service to a gay couple as long as the claim it's against their religion. Now Judge Lampe has made it legal for business to refuse service if they can use religion to justify it. So now a Christian bakery can even deny decorating a cake with the star of David or decorating a cake for a couple that is on their second marriage. Kern County Judge David Lampe side with bigotry today. This decision will be reversed and Judge David Lampe's name will live in infamy.<//text>< Pictures>

Best thing at this courthouse is the authentic Mexican food in the basement cafeteria.  I was in trial for a few days last month and the wife and I had lunch there twice and breakfast once.  Best Mexican food in Bakersfield and probably Kern County, at cafeteria prices!  Real chile relleno, with homemade beans and rice.  A puerco (pork) costillas burrito topped with cheese.  Heavenly.  These ladies cook it low and slow.  Breakfast burritos that knock the socks off any roach coach.</Text>

<Review>The question people should be asking is where is Jose Benavides  ? Well he isn't at the Kern Superior court anymore due to the lack of respect for a human being in the court room D. He mocks people and belittles and that is against the law. The microphones in the court room are not there to hold you accountable but to monitor the judges. Jose I believe is now over in Shafter and Commanco " spelled incorrectly? is now serving in his place. The courts, The website and everyone that deals with this place is supposed to look after the kids best interest but they can't even do that bc of all the appointments that the Judge, Attorney's have that not just pertain to court but also with appointments they have in their personal life. Laws have been voted in and ignored in court all bc of one law and that law gives the judge the authority to make his own decisions due to the best interest of the children. Kern county itself is completely screwed up from the courts to the police department and by the past this seems to be true.<//Review><name>James Wright Sr</name><Gmap_id>0x80ea698a08af3c93:0x3e506efd5cb5a42a<//Gmap_id><rate>1</rate><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

<text>"The criminal professional tenant said in front  of the mediator: "She have to pay me to move out, criminals are rewarded"  she was laughing of California justice system, she has been evicted before  ...... I' own a house that I rent to a  GANG ( I didn't know  I run their background but I made an HONEST MISTAKE I should know better, yes, I was naive, yes, I try to help them yes...all my HONEST MISTAKE ) , BUT , it was an HONEST MISTAKE .I work VERY HARD to purchase  and keep my property in Cal City ! ANYWAYS Yesterday I went to this court  and OMG. The landlord tenant law in California is UNLAWFUL it self, it is  almost useless to be a landlord and try to collect any money from criminal professional tenants THE LAW PROTECTS CRIMINALS !!!! Do you understand the gravity of this problem ?? A whole state that has .LAWS to punish the VICTIM and protect the CRIMINALS !!!  Those laws are 100% wrong !!!!   The problem with this court it is not the judiciary or law enforcement the  , the real issue here it is the  LAW !!! Those laws must be changed. The criminals professional tenants I'm referencing here are GENERATIONAL CRIMINALS that work as a GROUP ( like a MAFIA ) Are you kidding me that in The Land of the brave and the free,  our laws protects criminals  ?! Talk about INVERSION OF VALUES !!! I left that court HAPPY TO BE ALIVE !!!!!  I'm giving 5 STARS to the BRAVE mediator Ms. Tina Hopper,  Service 12 Comissioner your Honor Linda Ethiene  ( SORRY  I PROBLABLY MISS SPELLED HER LAST NAME)  and all the BRAVE LAW ENFORCMENT OFFICERS I forgot his name but if theres a good person working there and I witness MANY BRAVE  and HONEST people working unbeliaveble hard to  make justice ( EVEN THOU THE LAW PROTECTS CRIMINALS )  But she is at the 12 service (I'm not good with words or grammar but even an IGNORANT PERSON LIKE ME CAN SEE CLEARLY THAT the CALIFORNIA LAWS for tenant and landlords are PROTECT CRIMINALS !!!!!! )  I lost my case because there's NO WAY for a victim win their case with California tenant and landlord law without spend a FORTUNE. So my 5 starts go to THE PEOPLE I MENTIONED ABOVE FOR RISKING THEIR LIVES EVERY DAY WORKING UNDER SUCH HOSTILE CONDITIONS AND TRYING TO SAVE AND KEEP US ALL ALIVE. Thank you for your service, you know who you are. Whitout people like YOU the world would be gone long ago !!!  NOTE: There was another old landlord  dealing with his professional tenant, and his professional knowing I'm a landlord , she set by me trying to scam me. to right there already, they all know they can play the system, criminals in california do NOT respect the law system and that's why there's so much disrespect towards the police and in other hand that's why some bad cops infiltrate into the system, it is a SWAMP .....</text><rate>5< /rate><response>None<//response><user>109078657946461040204< /user></record>

I was informed that someone had used my name in a petty theft years ago. I went to court for 2 months trying to clear my name. Kept getting told there were more hoops to jump through.
Finally, got a "factual finding of innocence" signed by the judge.
Seemed like a victory. But not only did the courts fail to remove the crime from my record but MERGED me and this other person as ALIASES and now I can't get a job because of this record and was given new charges/arrested over an argument that the cops said normally wouldn't be an arrest but because "the computer" said i had such an extensive criminal record, they thought i deserved to go to jail!
These people are ruining lives and are a threat to society.<//Text>

this is by far the laziest no good people I've ever had to deal with, not only have i not seen my kids in over ten years, but they wont help me find them nor point me in any direction as too who I'm supposed to talk too, i had a worker named Mr.Jones who never called me back, I was injured for over fove years due to a crushed hand and just now mending it back, but decided to get a job with a better paying company ✔ which i did, and they're taking money out of my pay check, and askimg to pay more but still wont let me gey a court date for visitation rights when my ex, illegally took my kids over ten years ago whwn i was at work, i havent seen them since can anyone on google help me since this state that we live in and pay taxes for cant help me out a fellow tax paying American, and Republican...</Text>

We have seen motions rejected on one day for (not original copy) then refiled the very next day and rejected as (untimely)! Hum yet they accepted the motion at the time of filing! I smell a rat! This system has not changed one bit since Ed Jagels was running the place! A shame! The Judicial System in the State of California is being made to look like a complete "JOKE"! By Kern County Superior Court Judges! They should be in control but instead it has been our experience that most or all are under the DA's thumb! It seems that the Judges have no guts to do the right thing, and follow the letter of the law! Kern County has it's own laws!

All the motions we filed were "Originals" and they acted as if everything was fine when we served them! yet days later when we arrive for the Court Date, we find out after hours of waiting that all the motions were rejected! The Court Date was canceled, but we were never informed! Good Work! The only way for we the People to make a difference is to enact laws to hold this type of actions, accountable as to all involved! Employee's, Judges, DA's ect. But mark my words every Judge, DA's, and Employees would be against any law that would make them accountable! The dirty business of "law in Kern County" continues! It is more than just a shame it is a crime!< /Text><Resp>None</Resp></record>

Judge is incompetent of his position does not apply the law disregards the California court rules ,  makes arbitrary  orders and judgments by rule of man not rule of law.  Does not even site any statutory laws with in   any procedures. Disregards and disobeys the oath he swear to in regards to the Constitution.  He is a true Ecclesiastical Dishonor .

My stylist, VANESSA, was amazing! She was incredibly receptive to all of my questions and gave me her honest opinion on everything. Very knowledgeable and professional. The entire experience was great, and I’m in love with my new hair! After almost 2 years of trial and error with other salons, I’m happy to say I found my new go-to salon, and hair stylist! ❣️<//Review>

Melissa is fab. She fixed some dismal highlights I had done by my previous stylist and also helped me change to a different color palette when I was ready for a change a few months later. Highly recommend for cut and color!</text>

<Text>Not sure why YELP Deleted my review. So I thought I would share on here.

I highly recommend all people to AVOID this salon at all cost. The owner Paulette does not deserve any business due to her lack of empathy towards customers and the way she treats people.

I came in here a few weeks ago and got a balayage by Andres. I was quoted $295 on the phone. I was in complete shocked after leaving the salon when he told me my total was $550. I gave him a tip in addition to that. I was in total belief since I was charged almost double from what I was quoted.

I’m not sure why he charged me an extra $100 for the balayage alone. If I knew this place would cost $550 for a balayage and that they would  add additional services that I did not require, I would have taken my business elsewhere. He gave me a hair cut that was really bad and choppy, and then gave me a root melt that I never requested. He actually forgot that he chopped a portion of my hair when I came in when finishing up on my hair.  In addition to that, I don’t believe this salon cares about the health of your hair. The stylist had left bleach in my hair for over 3 hours while working on other clients hairs at the same time. My hair was super dry and plastic like when I came home. I don’t think he cared about the health of my hair, and I felt the amount of time he left bleach in my hair was negligent.

I called the salon the next day and had a conversation with the owner Paulette. She didn’t acknowledge that the stylist was negligent by leaving bleach in my hair for that long. She told me that she would refund me $75 for the haircut but lied and never did. She was also trying to bully me once I told her I needed the consumer affairs number so I can notify them about the stylist being negligent on my hair. Paulette had the audacity to try to bring my coworker in to the conversation whom got her hair done the previous day with another stylist. She made up a LIE. She said my coworker said “ no stylist wants to work on my hair “ which was far from the truth. Honestly, I don’t know why she felt the need to make up that lie. I felt she was upset and was trying to bring me down.  I actually came to try out this salon due to the high reviews that Andres received.

When I ask Paulette for the consumer affairs number, she said it was "too far and it was a waste of her time to give me their number." It’s actually a requirement that they have to provide you with that number. I also asked the salon for a license number for their establishment so I can start the complaint and was refused it. Part of the complaint process was providing the business license number. Andres also had sent me a text messaging threatening me saying that he would call the cops on me for harassment when I ask to be provided with his license number so I can file a complaint. I told him to go a head and call them since I am doing nothing wrong.

I don’t want anyone to ever go through this Horrific experience that I went through. The owner Paulette is a bully, and treats people with disrespect, and is a liar. I can’t believe she tried to make a rumor, I spoke to my colleague that day and she said that she never even said that a stylist didn’t want to do my hair. I will NEVER recommend this Salon to anyone, given the way the way Paulette treated me. Also most importantly, don’t go to a place that does not care about the health of your hair, bleach in your hair for 3+ hours is negligent.< /Text>< Rating>

< review>
My daughter had been complaining about how thick and long her hair was, especially with this heat and she had been saying how she wants to cut her hair I asked her what kind of cut she wanted and she picked a Pixie cut. We were both pretty nervous because it was such a dramatic cut. One of the moms from my sons school had told me she worked here so I thought I would give it a shot. The hairstylist's name is Angel and that's exactly what she was an angel.😇 She was very nice to my daughter she talked to her through out the haircut process. She cut and washed her hair and styled it. My daughter was so happy and loves her new hairstyle. She keeps asking me if Angel is going to cut her hair again. I let her know that we will definitely be going back to her for her touch ups in the future. I will definitely be recommending Her to all of my friends.<//review>

<text>I haven't gone to a salon in some time, regardless of COVID and I was eager to read reviews of various salons in San Jose. I decided on Dollhouse and was very pleased with my experience. My hair was a long, dry, frizzy mess. Elizabeth H cut, layered, and shaped my hair in a way that still kept my interests but did so that was flattering for me with low-maintenance. After she finished my hair (fantastic job), Andres (@colorbyandres) performed a full-keratin treatment. He was informative, funny, easy-going, and professional. My hair is now silky smooth and free from frizz!  I'm so happy! The salon was clean, enforced proper hygiene, and safety measures to prevent the spread of COVID, and made me feel welcome.  I will definitely come back for my next hair appointment and am eager to work with Andres for a color and follow-up keratin treatment in the future! I would highly recommend this salon as well as Andres and Elizabeth!<//text>< Time>

<Text>Male stylist had a bad attitude, did not try to solution seek- just kept trying to upsell us. We kept getting interrupted by his partner during haircut asking when he was going to be done. Her attitude along with his attitude and the constant sales session made for a bad experience, which a this price point is a deal breaker. We were in the market for a Balayage for my wife but decided to hold off and took our business elsewhere. Every time here it seems like someone is getting into an argument with a client over undisclosed charges and price point. Not worth a try.</Text>< pics>

<review>I have visited Dollhouse Salon a few times before for a haircut and everytime the service, quality and experience has been exemplary. But I decided to post this review specially for Dollhouse Salon's preparedness and process related to Covid-19. After I scheduled the appointment for a haircut via phone, I got a covid form via text. Filling the waiver form was simple and fast via phone. They also sent a text note to call them after having arrived at the Salon. After arriving, the salon rep took my temperature (I was wearing my mask all time) and then I waited in the car until my hairstylist was ready. Mask is required before entering the Salon premises. I noticed for the neighboring business mask was not required. The hairstylist was wearing mask and shield and so were other stylists and folks. The hairwash, trimming, blow drying took 35-40 min in total. I truly recommend Dollhouse to anyone looking for haircut.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808e33c2f33ec923:0xded265564d3a863< /GmapID></record>

<text>top of the top! I have found my hair Salon! Ask of Simone! She is such a sweet, lovely and caring person but most of everything she is super professional! Simone listened to what I wanted and guessed immediately the right job for me. She made me amazing copper highlights which suit me perfectly and give me a younger and fresher look! Thank you Simone, you made my day :-)<//text>< pictures>

I don't normally leave reviews for places, but this salon deserves recognition, especially my hair stylist Lauren. I only recently discovered this place and went in to get a really short haircut, which I'd never tried before. Lauren was exceptional with her services; she first sat me down and talked to me to get a better understanding of what exactly I was looking for. She gave me honest feedback on what to expect and what not to. She also helped me understand different hairstyle techniques I could try on my short hair. After she finished cutting my hair, I was delighted to see that she gave me the same haircut as the photo I had shown her! I walked out that door 100% satisfied. But that's not the end. Today I went back to get a trim and Lauren thought I was back too soon (three weeks
later lol...still trying to get the hang of short haircut routine), but to make sure I left happy and satisfied, she trimmed and cleaned up my hair for FREE! I have never seen such genuinely nice and professional hair stylists before and I highly recommend Lauren to everyone!</text>

Best cut and color I've had in years!  The management is wonderful and Josh is a miracle worker with cutting and coloring hair.  I had a vision of what I wanted my style to be and he nailed it the first time in saw him!  Thank you Dollhouse salon!  I'm super happy with my new look!  ♡</Text>

Josh is the very best! I never know what to do with my thin wavy hair, and Josh has cut my hair a couple of times and has managed to give me volume and easy style. Can't wait for him to do my color. 🤩</review>

I recently got a KeratinTreatment and had a really terrible experience with the result. Just after my first wash my hair could feel no difference.  Looks like they dont use a good product and I am being told I used the wrong shampoo and for the price i paid 350$ totally disappointed. i have done such treatments on my hair even earlier and they lasted for more than a year.  Not recommended for Keratin Treatments<//review>

Excellent experience! I went in for a color correction after getting my hair done at another salon. I saw Vanessa who not only saw me for a consultation, but adjusted her schedule to squeeze me in for an emergency appointment. After 5.5 hours for a color correction, I left with an amazing ombre! Thanks again Vanessa -- YOU ROCK!< /text>

A wonderful salon. It's very professional and cute. The decor is nice, with a vintage black and white feel. The entire staff works hard to make your visit enjoyable. As soon as you check in for your appointment, or walk in, they offer you something to drink. All of the stylists are professional and very talented. The hair stylist I always go to and recommend is Elizabeth Hardin. She specializes in hair color and cuts. You can find her on Instagram @elizabeth_hardin_<//Text>

Kendy is my girl! She is amazing - absolutely friendly and relatable and makes you feel comfortable and confident in her work. My sister referred me to Kendy after a haircut and said that for the first time ever, Kendy made my sister feel like she had beautiful hair- all previous stylists would negatively comment about my sister's hair. So I went, a little intimidated by the salon rep for being for the very hip and young, but Kendy instant became my forever stylist. I still recommend her to all my friends!!< /review>

I give Dollhouse Salon one star for Pam, who did a consultation with me. She was honest and said vibrants weren't in her skill set. She recommended a conditioning mask that works great and referred me to two other stylists who wouldn't overlap my highlights.

Still, I was referred to Dollhouse by a friend who likes their online booking. Their servers were down when I tried to book online. Losing customers.

So I went into the salon and booked a consultation. I came back the same day for a consultation. After the consultation, the person working reception told me the first recommended stylist was booked out about six weeks. But she recommended someone who works with vibrants. She made me an appointment for 8 am on a Saturday morning.

8 am on a Saturday morning I show up, but my appointment isn't in the books. Losing customers.

A woman tries for twenty minutes to find someone who will come in and work with me, but nothing pans out. The assistant manager says offers me a 20% discount, but then an appointment still seems allusive. Losing customers.

She offers me Pam, but Pam has already told me with refreshing honesty that she's not the stylist for me. Losing customers.

I finally decide that this isn't the salon for me.</Text>

So 06/13 was my birthday, I called to ask if Johnathan was available and unfortunetly not, so they recommended their "Sr. hairstylist" that charged $60 for just a cut when my usual charges $45. Well I decided why not if she's a senior hairstylist? And I found why I shouldn't of done it. as soon as I sat down she asked what did I want where I responded with what I didn't want instead, to give her freedom 😒 At first it was fine when she was done because my hair was wet but she literally did just a straight cut !!!! I told her I didn't want a straight cut ! Anyone could've done this ! I have really curly hair and this cut makes me look like a cotton ball ! Specifically told her I didn't want to look like one. I don't even want a refund so I don't have to return to her at all. Shouldn't of tipped her, she barely even spoke to me. Horrible!<//Text>

<Name>D. Rose< /Name><Date>1531013543491</Date><rating>1</rating><Text>I called to schedule and appointment for a cut, I specifically asked for a dry cut and was assured that the stylist would be ok with it. I drove there - took me an hour and when I met with the stylist and took her through the cut, she said she didn't feel comfortable doing a dry cut. And then she said something which was more concerning, she was going to texturize my fine, curly hair. So you want to thin out my hair? That's a huge no for curly hair as it breaks up the curl and makes your hair frizzy. Then two people spoke to me about my cut and what I was looking for - at this point I had been there for a half hour and then after explaining again to someone there what I was looking for, they said they wouldn't have anyone today....so they probably could have started with that. I'm not driving another two hours for this. Just an overall crappy experience.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I have never left a negative review and I feel bad to have to do so. This was my worst haircut experience ever!
I booked an appointment with Natasha who joined Dollhouse right after school and has been there since 4 years.
When we started, I shower her pictures of the haircut that I wanted. I tried explaining here the look I wanted and she rarely communicated with me about what will look good and what not depending on my hair. Or what was possible to do.. Or whether we are at the same page on what I want.. Nothing at all...!!
Once I got my hair washed, she very carelessly cut off a few strands and within 2 mins, she asked her assistant to dry off my hair and left for cutting someone else's hair. yes! She cut someone else's hair in my appointment time, which sucked!! Since she was gone for quite some time, I got time to have a closer look at what she had done so far. I found this huge gap in my hair around my neck on left side which did not exist on right side. I was so upset..!! When she came back, I told her about the gap and I think after a few mins she realized her mistake.. Nonetheless, she kept cutting my hair and after taking off most of my hair length, it was nothing close to what it looked like in pictures I showed earlier. I had to stop her from cutting my hair anymore and have her call someone else for second opinion. She then called Josh who very quickly realized what a mess she had made. but even after taking opinion from Josh, she cut my hair horribly.. My hair is uneven from all sides. It looks like a grown out pixie.. I hate my haircut and it is FAR from anything close to what I wanted. I feel I could do a better job than her in cutting my hair.

On top of that they charged me 60$ for the haircut.. So unprofessional.. No sense of customer service or satisfaction whatsoever..
Regarding Natasha, I doubt if she knows how to give layers or rather cut short hair. I can not comment on any other stylist since I didn't experience their work (don't even want to any more). but please do not got to Natasha for short haircuts unless you want a complete disaster.!!</Text>

Amazing beach! Beautiful! Surfers to watch. Long Beach you can walk or run. Dogs are allowed but are suppose to be kept on leash. Bathrooms in the parking lot. Big parking lot. Pretty popular spot.</Text>

Beautiful area and *MUCH* cooler than even 10 miles inland (85 deg F vs. 116 deg F).  Saw Sea Otters playing/fishing in the bay, and the view across and around the bay is gorgeous.<//text>

Great views, but no dogs allowed, even on leash.  If you have a dog, head north of the campground about 3 miles north from here for a spectacular off leash beach.</Text>

<Review>Beautiful beach to picnic, surf, chill, or go for a swim. The waves are sometimes sneaky and rogue waves often come up high so don't sit too close to the surf if you cant move all your gear in a jiffy.

Highly recommend picking up some seafood at Giovanni's and eat on the beach. Watch out for pesky gulls that will snatch your food at every opportunity.

If you don't mind going for a short walk, highly recommend checking out Cairn Park on the other side of the rock and keep your eyes peeled for groups of otters floating in the bay.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlNhtoOEeFaZua4IvPy6-3cYyflnoOuABSEjoL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMyywuK_SCAfvElPvrFTdYrBdgq2NNa1-kJSUJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI8XTAp4ix1vOfobBYiYPOv3txWZmgEWY-jqJE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2UeWDbBxT8t2p-VWvagcBtL9W-PAdN7ImwK-O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXVFYGiSC_Nq2nkYwPTqded7X_WkD5Apsd1dRV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWlCMJaWoVl-zJq7jIkzuCRu1xuGHthmOqZThC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNU0WehVgYcXACfXAtadG2qx_M3oKiaJ2JokK0Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDT5TehK-XMcdjnK7mf5cKmqYjCBCsEQs0GxXV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFfzXCT9JeqoLVqqknRPucSzlfbzt5PdT40yw4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Name>

We had a really delicious brunch here! The Poached Asparagus is my favorite but the Eggs Blackstone is good too. It also comes with a glass of champagne! They happened to run out of potatoes so we got bacon instead (score!) and also they gave a little cake to my mom for her birthday. The service was great and the food was even better!

They always serve you hot bread and a plate of minced garlic in olive oil, which is delicous. I've also had dinner here before and had a great experience. Their pumpkin ravioli is so good!< /text>

NOT impressed with cleanliness of the OWNER who makes ALL cold appetizers, salads and desserts! only used a glove to clean, so her hands didn't get gunk on them! open cans were on the counter directly in front of us. they should really look at what the customer sees when they sit at the counter! won't return, we are both grossed-out< /review>< resp>

<date>1405546091932< /date><Review>This place is incredible. Food is delicious. Service is impeccable. Went once and was impressed. Went a second time about a month later and was blown away when Juan addressed me by name. He recalled it from the one time I was there a month previously. Juan treated us like old friends and was on the spot with everything we needed. I've eaten at countless restaurants near and far. This level of service and hospitality is very hard to find. The food menu, for honest and delicious authentic Italian cuisine, is incredibly reasonable in price.

This place has vaulted to the top of my favorite Italian eateries. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808fe9bd25494aff:0xc38c42b5773150cc<//Gmap_id>< Response>

The Calamari steak is the best I've ever had and the vegetables that come with it are always fresh and tasty.  Indoor and outdoor seating available.

<Review>From the warm and friendly welcome at the front door to the "Thank you for coming!" good-bye from our server Juan, my family and I had a most wonderful dining experience at Fontina.  It is always a good feeling to leave a restaurant wanting to return soon to try several other items on the menu.  All five of us from three generations feel that way and are looking forward to the next time.  We had appetizers that were fresh and not overcooked.  Everyone ordered a different entrée and all of them were superb!  Of course that called for desserts and they did not disappoint.  The wait staff were attentive to our needs and engaging.  The entire evening brought back memories of fine dining in Rome where there is mouth-watering food and conviviality.</Review>< Pictures>

They topped it off with roasted pine nuts and that sent the dish over the top! Delicious will definitely+ be going back. The wine paring they suggested was a delicious - an imported white Pigno Grisio. Will be back again soon! Thanks!</Text><Name>Lynn Benson< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Usually like this place, might need to rethink it. Service was really slow took about 50 minutes to get our food. While the food was fresh and hot it was over cooked and not seasoned correctly. Really unfortunate experience this time round.</Text>

Ordinary - overpriced restaurant. Lamb was over cooked, pasta was tasteless, wines on the menu were  not available. Service was ordinary too.

Bruschetta was the only palatable item we ordered.< /Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Name>Susanne Halstead</Name><text>Went to Fontina on a Friday night. The place was crowded, but they were able to accommodate us on a small two person table.
The ambiance is set for upscale dining, and the menu reflects that ambition. The food however, does not even remotely live up to the expectation set. We had the calamari appetizer, the filet mignon with shrimp and the seafood risotto. All food was very poorly exdcuted. It is obvious that whoever is responsible for the recipes has never been to Italy. The seafood risotto had a safran rice base and then was smothered by a seafood mix in a tomato based sauce. It seems that it would be the exact mix that goes into their seafood pasta. The filet was missing flavor, the meat was tough, the shrimp were overcooked. To top it all of, the mashed potatoes were clearly from a bag, at $28 the plate I expect not to be served convenience food. Overall, the kitchen lacks skill and takes too many shortcuts.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Food was great. Unfortunately no options to eat indoors and it was a very windy day. We also got there late in the day and they had sold out of a couple items we would have liked to order. We'll be more prepared next time because we're definitely coming back. Best BBQ food in the area!<//review></record></dataset><record>

Delicious food, everything is on point. Ribs are soft and tender, tri tip is mouth watering and sides are hot full of flavor.<//text>

Great BBQ the worker suggested I change my order from ribs and chicken to ribs and brisket. I'm glad It listened. The brisket was Soo delicious and not to Smoky. It was the best I've had.</text>

< Review>
Had the 3 rib plate with baked beans as our side, brisket sandwich and a corn bread.  Rib meat fell off the rib!  So juicy and delicious.  A good bbq sauce.  The brisket sandwich was absolutely delicious!  Enjoyed every bite.  Came with pickles and onion, but not overwhelmed with onion - just enough slices to enhance flavor.  The baked beans were perfect.  Cornbread was delicate and absolutely scrumptious.  So why the 4 out of 5 stars... the frowns - not sure if it was a racial thing or maybe the guy was having a bad day but I didn't appreciate the frowning stares.<//Review>

<review>Found myself around the corner from Slick Fork and gave it a try. Ordered a chicken plate, tri-tip sandwich, pulled pork sandwiches, side of corn bread, coleslaw and mac n cheese. SlickFork did not disappoint! The crew at the window was chill, and the easy going kind of fun professionalism that befits a BBQ joint. Clean tables, modern feel, EXCELLENT FLAVOR. I can't say that enough...... EXCELLENT FLAVOR.

I ordered takeaway and salivated for the 20 minute drive home as the various aromas filled my car. 20 minutes of imagination  can really kill a meal if you're taking all the smells in and the reality doesn't live up to the a vivid imagination.  But this..... oh.. the meat just melted  on the tongue. Perfect flavor blend, just enough sweet, just enough spice and neatly balanced against the raw onion and pickle on the pulled pork. By far the best pulled pork I've had on the west coast. Corn bread was the right size portion, filling without the dryness. The slaw was a nice punch of crisp color and texture to complete my meal. Just that good.

As for the tri-tip, chicken and mac n cheese... all I heard was chewing and intermittent sighs of pleasure between bites. A good sign from an otherwise chatty crew.

In all, definitely 5 stars. The kind of place you make sure to bring out of town family and friends  to. I'm pretty sure their menu is available online. Be sure to come and order early in the day before they sell out... this is a meal you don't want to miss!<//review><Response>None<//Response><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

THE BEST BBQ IN TOWN! Ribs, Tri-Tip and Brisket are finger licking good! The mac-n-cheese is the BEST, I said THE BEST! Baked beans delicious,  cornbread ON POINT, cowboy corn and potato salad are Ok,  not the best but OK. I recommend this place! The staff are nice and helpful, the portions are very generous. It's been two Saturdays in a row that we've came here since I heard about this place! Stop reading and go order now!!</Text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>I’m from Texas and this is the one of the best bbq places I have been to in California. I got the brisket sandwich, beans, Mac and cheese, and potato salad. The sides where amazing and the sandwich was great but it had a cow smell and Idk what it is about California a lot of meats I have out here smell like I’m biting right into a cow. Other then that the service was great and I would definitely come back.<//Text>< response>

Delicious corn bread and meats.. the mack and cheese had no flavor though. The bread on the tri tip is horrible quality bread. Broke apart quickly and got mushy sort of like dollar hamburger buns.<//text>

<Text>After coming here a couple of times this last visit wasn't the same! I've tried the brisket, sides and tri-tip of which the tri-tip and brisket are good but the sides aren't that good and that's why I went with 4 stars. In addition this last visit the brisket was extremely dry and tasted odd. It seems that they're not too consistent. The staff is ok and at times seem to be mad or something.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

This little eatery gets 5 stars from me! The ribs tasted just like it should, not too salty and not too bland. Straight fall off the bone goodness! This place is a must of you love barbecued meats.<//review>

It was ok but not Texas bbq good... We go often to Texas to visit my wife's family. Slickfork has Great service, ok food but for the claim of being Texas bbq I expect a lot more in flavor compared to what I've had in Texas (popular places to small bbq joints in South and Central Texas). Brisket was a little overcooked and fell apart while holding it, pork was spot on cooking wise, ribs were a little over cooked. Mac and cheese had little flavor. Overall lacking in flavor big time. I'm not much of a sauce person so good bbq to me shouldn't need sauce. And this needed sauce.  Yet to find anywhere in California that matches TX bbq or memphis style bbq. So I dont see why restaurants label themselves Texas style. Its California style plain and simple and there is nothing wrong with that.<//Text>

Looking for a place to have lunch  happen to notice  The slick fork  with many Customer coming and going so it must be good, our first time and the owners treated us like VIPs suggesting  the Sampler Platter  It was more than enough I have eaten at many barbecues throughout the bay area and I would have to say this place is probably the best I’ve had !
great  family business very Friendly<//review>

This place has some of the best BBQ I have ate.  The brisket is amazing!  It is outside eating or take out only but that doesn't matter when the food is outstanding.  Prices are good and food is great.  The only thing I would change is I wish they had water available, I don't like drinking sodas and I hate paying for bottled water.<//text>

<Text>I've only had their tri tip and bbq beef sandwiches and I tried their beans one time.  They give you very generous servings and the meat is very tender, but for me the amount of pepper they put into their bbq sauce is way to much for my palate.  I feel it would be much better without so much pepper added to their sauce.  Their beans that I tried once were a big disappointment to me as well.  They could easily make their sides much tastier by using different recipes than the ones they currently use.  I would gladly help them out to come up with better side recipes if they would like some help.  I do believe their sides could become very popular as well with some tweaks here and their.<//Text>< Pics>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>Tri tip was delicious on a brioche bun!  Super tender and smoky.  My sandwich had so much meat I had to take half of it off so I could get my mouth around it to take a bite.  Service was quick and terrific as well.  Bradley has such a sweet demeanor.  This place sells out quickly so preorder the day before to make sure  you get what you want.  Mac and cheese was a bit too cheesy for my taste and the noodles were not al dente but all the other sides were delicous as well.  The cowboy corn is rich and spicy so I could have ordered less but lucky me lots of leftovers due to the generous portions.  A new family favorite!</Review>< gmap_id>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Hughsons well kept secret. This place has some great bbq . They offer family packs from small to big. Sandwiches and sides. My favorites has to be their brisket/brisket sandwich , Tri tip, ribs,mac n cheese and potato salad. And you have to try their cornbread,its amazing. Also be aware they only open Friday to Sunday from 11am untill they sell out of food. Highly suggest you call before you make the drive.</Text>< resp>

My gf and I have been wanting to come and try this place for awhile. We came a little after they opened today. She got a tri tip sandwich. I got a brisket sandwich. OH MY!  They were extremely delicious! Plenty of meat on each sandwich.  Then grab some of there awesome bbq sauce to add to it or dip your sandwich in. I also tried there potato salad. While I prefer some mustard in mine (not sure if there was any in it). It was still good and fresh tasting.  Next time we come here, I'll be trying there ribs.  People just need to keep in mind that it is a straight up bbq place. Therefore, once they sell out. Thats it for the day.<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I just moved to Sacramento and needed my braces to be looked at because it wasn't working out for me. I decided to come here and just a get a consult but I ended up loving the place and area. Everyone is so friendly and especially the lady in the front with red hair is super nice! Yasmin and Dr Tran are both wonderful people! They showed me what my teeth were gonna look like after and how its moves with Invisalign and I couldn't be more happier !! I highly recommend coming here.</Text>< Pictures>

My son broke a bracket and we were able to get an appointment same day to fix the problem.  It didn't take long to fix and no one made me feel like it was my fault. I'm very grateful for their service.</Text>

I just went in to this office for a consultation on braces and I had a very positive first experience here. I was able to schedule this consultation last minute today and did not have to wait long to be seen. I especially liked working with the treatment coordinator Yasmin!  She answered all of my questions and was very personable, making me feel good about the process for getting my braces! I am excited to start this process and I am feeling positive for my future with this office! Thank you! 🙂<//review>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>It was my daughters first time there to get a consult for braces and Yasmin I believe that’s her name was fantastic I can see why they put her to be the one to talk to people before I left there I was like ohhhhh yeah y’all can take my money LOL no but really her customer service was through the roof she explained everything well and made sure nothing was left out thank you also Dr Tran was awesome as well he came and met us and explained everything just as well as Yasmin. So thank you Dr Tran and Yasmin for your help I’m excited to have my daughter get her teeth taken care of with you guys!!!!

PS. The over all team was awesome not just these two you will definitely be in great hands when you chose Premier Orthodontics< /Review>< rate>

My Experience at Premier Orthodontics has been amazing to say the least.
From financing with Yazmin (she is very professional and friendly) to front desk with Kim (she has always greeted me with a smile) all the way to the back with Dr Tran and Olga P. They have both made me feel very comfortable with my treatments. Nielly, you have amazing staff. I highly recommend this Orthodontics office. Thank you all for going above and beyond to making me feel comfortable.
When I went in for a consult, I was very nervous. Now I go in feeling very excited for my treatments. Thank you!<//review>

Yasmin Gonzalez is the absolute best! She assisted me with signing the contract for my daughter's braces and was extremely helpful. I needed some help after signing the contract and Yasmin responded quickly and made sure we were taken care of. She is simply the best. Thank you Yasmin!!! Premier Ortho - Natomas<//review>

<Review>This is our first time with Premier Orthodontics and all I can say is "WOW!".  I took in both my daughters for a consultation, Yazmin with financing was amazing to say the least.  She went over every little detail from the different types of braces they offer, to which would work best for which girl and even the breakdown of the cost.  She had lots and lots of patience with me and my questions.  Today we got one daughter down and when our 2nd daughter is ready, we will be returning!< /Review><name>DHARSY YOUNCE< /name><user_id>111775995581830571057< /user_id>< time>

<Text>We took our daughter in to get braces and ended up getting Invisalign. So far, it’s been a wonderful experience! Yasmin gave us a tour of the office, was very warm and welcoming, and answered all of our questions patiently and professionally. She made my daughter comfortable immediately and was very kind and caring. She is also very knowledgeable about the services offered and was able to answer all questions in detail. Honestly, this has been the best experience that we’ve ever had at a dentist/Orthodonics office. The office is clean, comfortable, and bright. Everyone has been very professional and friendly. The office staff seems very organized and responsive. The orthodontist was friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. I recommend Premier Orthodontics in Natomas to anyone looking at getting braces or Invisalign.</Text><Gmap_id>0x809ad63b6023b2db:0x830ff050d27c202b< /Gmap_id>< Pics>

<Text>Terrible communication, scheduled the appointment to remove my braces and when I drove all the way into town (4hour drive) they told me they need to schedule an appointment to remove it and they can’t do it today. They say one thing and mean another. I would also get a different doctor nearly everytime and then the new doctor would say “who did that to your teeth” when referring to the ortho work they did. Wasted every dollar spent here< /Text>< Name>

<Text>The service here is great! They are super friendly and welcoming. I especially love the costumer service from the Treatment Coordinator, Yasmin. She is super friendly and she is very quick to answer all my questions and concerns. She makes me feel very comfortable and more relax in getting my braces done. I recommend going to her if you want your braces done and have questions you need answers to.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x809ad63b6023b2db:0x830ff050d27c202b<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Let me begin by saying because of New Management (Miguel) with  his professionalism and attention to deatail, I am definitely happy to say that this establishment deserves a Five Star rating!! With a leadership like that with unequivocal Customer Service you just can't lose.

Previously it was unorganized.  However, I would encourage you to come back and meet the Staff and welcome a yourself to a whole new experience!! They are super friendly and the wait time is not long! Stop by and say see them! You won't be disappointed neither will your New Smile!! Thanks again guys!!! 😉</Text>

Horrible place. Would have given them 0....Never liked it. Came for my appointments several times, but they had my retainers are at another office. Had to wait two hours so someone would go to Howe office to bring them to Truxel office. Staff scheduled appointments to howe office , but never mentioned about that location, so I came to my usual Truxel office. Called Howe office right away, but was told that I cant come in 20 min late because that would be too late and need to reschedule it (not to mention that I wait for my appointment at least an hour every time) Scheduling is rediculous...impossible to get appointment.  Nobody ever calls in ahead of appointment to verify.  New doctor told me he would not be able to close the gap between my teeth because  there is nothing he can do about it. Are you kidding me??? That's why I came to this office 3 years ago, and now when I wear retainers 12 hours, gap doesn't close completely,  and he assured me that he has same thing and I am way luckier than him because I can see this gap (so can everyone) and floss it 😱😱 really???? I paid so much money to get this service??????😡😡😡😡 find a better clinic with better professional staff...< /Text>

Love this place. My son just had his braces off and we picked up his retainer. They are great.

My son was a challenge but they worked with him. They kept him on his path and he ended up with a great smile.

I wanted to also mention two people who don't get a lot of credit but deserve it. Taylor at the front desk is amazing. Great customer service. Always friendly and smiling. Even with my difficult scheduling, she worked with me and made me feel that they cared about getting us an appointment that worked. She is a tremendous asset.

Last, but definitely not least, is Jessica. She is simply fabulous. She keeps the place running, dealt with any concerns I had, and was always smiling and laughing. She knows how to treat customers and is great at her job.

I have been to a lot of professional offices in my life. If more of them had someone like Taylor and Jessica, they would be run a lot better!<//Review>

The people who run premier don't care about you. So when you go in for your consultation don't be surprised when they push the more expensive option (invisalign) at you. I also asked if i could see what the oral surgeon would cost as it would be part of my treatment but they thought it would be funny to just ghost me on the referral for to one until i signed a contract with them.< /Review>

Horrible customer service. I had my braces done here 3 years ago. On my last appointment I was told to come back in about 1 year to check my retainer. I wanted to make an appointment the same day but they said they couldn't schedule so far in advance and that someone would call me to schedule an appointment. I never received a call or email and it slipped out of my mind even though I continue to wear my retainer every night. I called to make an appointment and they inform me it's $75 fee to simply adjust my retainer because it has been over 2 years. I never received a call or an email to schedule an appointment and I was never informed of this 2 year policy.
P.S. I was never impressed with their service. A couple times the staff worked on my braces they forgot to close the brackets. One of the girls there was particularly rough and I was very unhappy each time she worked on my teeth. Should have done my teeth elsewhere.</review>

Update: they just transitioned from image to premiere image so they may have changed for the better, who knows, but get a second opinion elsewhere. I went here a few years ago, I wish I went for a second opinion but thought if children's choice dental recommended it for my daughter, then it should be fine.  What they don't tell you: retainers for life!  I've asked others who had brace work or on their kids and they never heard of this.  If I had known I definitely would have gone elsewhere.When I went the office staff was ok, it takes awhile to check in and check out.  Oh forget the reward system they have it doesn't work, because apparently you need to let them know each time that your child is wearing the image shirt to input the credit.  And they won't give you credit when you tell them that your kid has worn it each time.
They lack communication in regards to making sure the plan is still set or you won't to move forward with it.  Billing department also is not efficient as it's a part time worker.  It's also sad when the billing person in charge was clueless.  They billed me for something that should have came with the program, but claimed it was for a prior visit, ok then why didn't you call before I set up the program for lifetime retainers???  Because the day i set it up, it says it covers teh same day visit, yet they charged me and said it was for a previous visit, sure.  Anyhow told them to refund me the lifetime plan because it's all bs. I want nothing to do with them.
Also, they rotate their orthodentist, that's also why i went elsewhere with pediatrics too, children's dentist around the office also rotate dentists.
The only nice thing about them is they are very patient and kind to kids while they work on their teeth.</Review>

<review>Im very upset at the management, the doctor is fine but trying to get someone to call you back, dont count on it. Youll have to visit the office for that. Made an appoinment for my daughter, they asked for my insurance and than booked my childs appointment. Two months later I go to the appoinment and the consultant says sorry we dont take your insurance anymore...than she has the nerve to say I called you yesterday to cancel the appointment....helllooooo you shouda called me two months ago, and a real professional orthodontist office would have made an exception for my daughter since they already made her appointment .</review>< pics>

Very frustrating experience here from start to finish. They were very fast to get my to sign paperwork for invisalign, but proceeded to need multiple castings of teeth because they were not right. My very last appointment (16 months later) I happen to be running a little behind. When I showed up they said I could not be seen, and could only schedule me 2 months out. So sitting with finished teeth, brackets stuck on, and having to wear disgusting last tray that was meant for 1 week...but now wearing for 2 months! Terrible service.</text>

<review>Took my girls here for a consult and both need braces. One nice thing about the office is the staff is pretty nice, but with the experience we had they deserve one star. We were told that our insurance would cover a few grand of the cost leaving us to be responsible for over 6 grand for two kids. We were told by Robin that regardless of what option we chose ( braces or Invisalign) it was all the same price. I get braces are not cheap but this just didn’t seem right. The coordinator Robin was pretty pushy to get us to start the treatment plan that day, with so much to discuss we opted to hold off and make an appt for a later date. After checking with my insurance they informed me that my out of pocket cost was half of what they told me. Contacted the office back and spoke to Robin where I was told that there was a difference in price with the Invisalign and actual braces. We were lied to and I’m 😡 how is this great customer service? Our initial visit were told regardless if we got braces or Invisalign it was all the same price and her act words were “it’s the same price across the board” and for that Image orthodontic I’m out. I will gladly take my business elsewhere that we aren’t going to be lied too and overcharged by thousands of dollars.< /review>< Pictures>

Horrible service I came in three weeks ago to have my forcers removed, the guy that worked on taking them out was very harsh and didn’t place any numbing cream or nothing just, try and pull out the crown that was attached to my tooth as a support for the forcers. I was in tears however they saw my gums where really swollen and still insistent on having them removed immediately. It ended up coming off with some of my gums attached to the crown very painfull experience. (I wouldn’t recommend for future patients to get forcers in).</text>

<time>1562217992189< /time><rate>4< /rate><Review>My first visit to this neighborhood gathering spot was a pleasant experience. I was part of a small group of sketchers that was allowed to meet here to draw anything in and around the quaint establishment including the cozy bar, the tanks that are used to brew craft beer on site and the patio seating area. During my group’s visit a soccer game was playing on the large-screen television and a good number of patrons were enthusiastically discussing the match. Judging from the presence of two well-behaved dogs, it is a pet-friendly place.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaAhOJF3-GOdRFD2Rv2kr3dzjfhNoAMZzHfZo8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2srFIjLvveUMbaF5hk1sfJdH8bjJqNHBrFUmi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmQ3pqxsipcB57SC5GF26nnUYZBRwvBMNz1Kc0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeVMxhOEDNIyleqklpgUpGIsULA9Revoc---SM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEhN7ut23p6iLTpPmAQwV30oaHPeyZHn5H2nUm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyRH4sIC7MaM-rqxE-e7Z_wzRyWDLVe9mw34ku=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x8085792ff9864f33:0x1d5789cd1b700e99<//gmap_id></record>

<review>Dog and kid friendly small brewer.  They usually have 6 or 7 beers on tap and outdoor seating is pretty easy to come by.  Beer is good and with its proximity to the Hotsy Totsy taco truck you are going to have a good time.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<text>Cozy and local. Rotating taps of craft brews for all tastes. Seats about 20 inside and a large outdoor patio can accommodate 50+ more.

There's a small kid's play area, and a popcorn machine to grab a free bowl to snack on at your table.

No kitchen on site, but sometimes there's food carts that show up in the evenings to give you a good meal. I'll be back for sure! 🍻< /text><Name>Mike Warren</Name>< pictures>

Very chill local brewpub with a variety of tasty beers on tap and friendly locals.  Cozy indoor seating and a great outdoor patio.  There was a very friendly man serving 3 kinds of delicious ramen on the patio while I was there.   They have different food vendors there most days.  Nice neighborhood spot!< /Text>

The place was small but super friendly and chill.  They was both outdoor and indoor seating options, and it's pet friendly.  I did try a couple beers and they were OK, but nothing stood out for me.  I'd come back here if in the area, but I'm not sure I'd seek it out for a beer.<//text>

<text>Sweet local brewery, good people, pretty good beer which I think will only get better over time. Tried the ESB and Porter, both solid.

Outdoor seating is a nice touch, right outside the Brew room. You can smell it while you drink. That's fresh! However, ain't no ocean in view.< /text>< Pics>

It's a tiny little place off of San Pablo Avenue very new and still quite clean as if it had just finished been built it's quite cramped inside although the outside is very nicely laid out and designed the beers are quite good and I think will develop a good reputation they have other things around if you're not a Beer Drinker and the food trucks come here frequently keep an eye on this place I think it's going to be a neighborhood popular destination congratulations to the owners on getting it done< /Review>

Great tap room where all the brews are unique, changing and true craft beers.  Every beer I tried was outstanding and gave me a new huh bar for that type of beer.</review>

I tried a couple different beers and both are very good.  The pair working know their beers very well and were spot on with their descriptions.   We will go back.</Review>

WOW, this place is seriously the best Chinese food I've had in a very long time. We have gotten takeout several times during COVID, and the quality and quantity of the food is incredible. Everything here is good, and we have ordered more than half their menu! All our friends we recommended this place to has loved everything.

We were on our way to walk down San Jose to find a place for lunch!
We noticed that Noodle talk was open!!! We saw they added some new dish in the menu, all looked delicious.

The owners and staff greeted us with smiles and were so friendly!! Inside is very clean too! Ellen was our waitress and was so lovely and offered so many yummy options. We started with the Cabbage Stir Fry and Hunan Style Spicy Organic Chicken with Bone. Of course, my favorite Beef Stew Noodle Soup. So yummy!

This is the staple of Asian Fusion meal and a must eat!!

Go go go!</Text>

Fried fish fillet with black pepper was excellent for dine-in. It was crispy and juicy inside. My husband loved braised pork with dry green beans and veg. dish dry string beans.It tasted like what I used to get at home. Not overly seasoned but well flavored. Glad to have dinner here.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7N6-5xN0dpqZG26zN4x8f-O87Ph3g5Re7jYOE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPR0AxGgKx4Si3R7364eEIrj4kM6L4I4zX5Mv_P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuEYJQbWKBNPb5u0-xD2KdOkJOLI2G4IXfEKW7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>{'time': 1617591951904, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving your review for our business.

Great customer service, easy to place order! Does a great job during pandemic. Sizzling squid was a little pricing, but it is worth!!! They use fresh and high quality squid. My daughter's favorite one was chicken wing with New Orleans sauce. We also ordered sweet and sour boneless chicken with pineapple which was awesome. I've never had such great tasty chicken. Enjoyed an incredible dinner! Came back again，met their new photographer and got new pics.< /Review>

<Text>It’s a great place to have some tasty food during quarantine. The Home Made Beef Shank was my favorite. It was seasoned well and easy to chew. The BBQ Whole Fish with Cauliflower was inconceivable. You can image how tasty the fish is, it was crispy, spicy (you can choose the level of spicy)and extraordinary when you mixed the fish with their homemade sauce. My husband is a big fun of Beef Tendon Noodle Soup. He added extra tendon on the side all the time. The noodles are perfectly cooked just he liked.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_yop74jEMAOsuYpAdZDMTCyk3OEzOyogEiOWF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO39V4MD-weOQkqBcfDP64cui4z8kYgF_AYOAST=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3FUqd6DNXv2snyyaAPkmiRRWcAWtdAO9IZT7e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

Noodle Talk San Jose is my favorite Chinese restaurant so far in the San jose area. Their food is very authentic and fresh. I love their BBQ Whole fish and the spicy Chicken. The tofu and noodles are very good. The dinning area is so clean and pretty. Even takeout orders still taste good.< /Review>

<review>Overpriced bland soup, and poor cuts of beef. Wouldn't mind if it was priced like the other place across the street, but $16 for beef stew of this level isn't worth it.< /review>< user_id>

I ordered A4 the tendon noodle soup and it was delicious! I walked in to place the order (I generally try to call in first but wasn't able to this time) on a Friday during the middle of dinner. I asked how long it would take and they said five minutes. Although I saw a bunch of other takeout orders ready, mine was ready in the time estimated. Will definitely return!< /review>

I’m glad to be one of the lucky customers who was able to come in for their soft opening. I especially like the huge picture wall that is to the right of the main entrance. What a unusual decoration style. It reminds me of the region south of the Yangtze. I enjoy this familiar Chinese style atmosphere very much. Of course, I also loved their delicious food and great service. The sticky rice dessert, steamed pumpkin, chicken soup, and steam pork...are all my favorites. Great restaurant indeed, and I will come back here for sure.<//Text>

Fantastic noodles spot! Great service, good selection of items. Again, the meat quality seems to be the best here.  The spicy beef shank noodle soup is the No.1 choice if you are a spicy food lover.< /Text>

Overpriced bland soup, and poor cuts of beef. Wouldn't mind if it was priced like the other place across the street, but $16 for beef stew of this level isn't worth it.</Text>

<text>This is my favorite restaurant Noodle talk. They just reopened on Jue 12,2020 due to COVID-19 . The inside is so pretty. I like their elegant, classic and modern Chinese design. The space is very open and big. The food is so good. Very authentic HuNan taste. I love their beef stir fry with green chili. I love all the noodle soup here. The service is very fast and friendly. It is so close to my office, I will come back very often.(PS, They have so many new dishes recently)< /text>< Date>

the owner always try to persuade me add more dishes that i don’t need. And they don’t allow me to use credit card under 20 dollars which is super inconvenient. When I refused her suggestion of order more dishes, her attitude became bad.</Text>

This is in addition to the other Fu Niu Tang franchise. the one simply serve the steamed crusine and noodles. Its kinda combined choices between Noodle Talk in Sunnyvale and Los Altos. It has yummy spicy hunan noodle and also other cookiy dishes like hunan steamed fish, icy spicy sticks, steamed egg fish, steamed pork belly etc.<//review>

<review>This is my favorite restaurant Noodle talk. They just reopened on Jue 12,2020 due to COVID-19 . The inside is so pretty. I like their elegant, classic and modern Chinese design. The space is very open and big. The food is so good. Very authentic HuNan taste. I love their beef stir fry with green chili. I love all the noodle soup here. The service is very fast and friendly. It is so close to my office, I will come back very often.(PS, They have so many new dishes recently)< /review>< pics>

<review>I just ordered a spicy beef noodles through doordash, with extra spicy beef. It came with extra beef tendon. And my name is god dame mis-spelled. This is a over-charging (~$35 lamb rack), cash-only, extremely poorly managed restraunt with a five-star chef. I have to come because the food is authenic, but the management is the worst, ever.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>Ordered the sour bean noodles and tendon salad. Noodles were decent but the tendon salad is off. Used the waiting list from yelp, yelp says arrive by a certain time but when I arrive before the given time, they said they already called by name. They sat us any way. I asked for chili and the guys came back 5 mins later with straws.

Lastly the price in the menu is off by $1.00. The bill will actually be $1.00 for each dish.<//Text><Name>DJ MK< /Name><GmapID>0x808fcd71c92ea751:0xb66cacb83cf67743< /GmapID><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

One star for the worst service ever.

I came to this place at a Wednesday noon. It was full. One waiter asked me to join a waiting list on a computer and I did. Five minutes later I got a message saying that my table was ready, when I found that two groups of people who joined the list after me had already been seated. I asked the waiter why I wasn’t seated and he said I wasn’t there. I said it’s not true as I’d been waiting in the restaurant all the time. Then he pointed at a empty table and told me to sit there. I was going to do so but a guy who just came out of restroom sit there. I was already unhappy but the waiter simply left without saying anything. I got so angry and left the restaurant.

I’m Chinese but I feel sorry for this Chinese restaurant. Their food might be good, but they don’t know how to serve people. They provide really bad service with bad attitude but they still are bold enough to ask for a tip.

Avoid this place.< /Review>

The first thing you notice would be the different decor style. A very Chinese look. Nice touch! We only tried the noodles the first time we were there. It's good but not exceptionally so. I think we'll go back again.</Text>

Noodle is over boiled. Very soft. Service is slow and not professional. Not worth the price at all. If you want good Hunan noodle, go to Sunnyvale.< /Review>

<Review>Sorry but my dish had no flavor pork rib something, small portion a lot of rice and over price  for the size of the portion. Remember was pork. The other bad thing was the servers, two who assisted me one has minum English to explaining the dish or menu and was chewing gum the second one cero English.
If you like to  target just your commuity please add a sing  with Sorry we do not speaking English.
And the last the don't  accept American Express card.
For my is a hello and good buy in the same day. I don't think I like to coming back to this restaurant.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN621wtdUtdhFglS-y1T1nInktw3lVPkoKwPs__=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<review>Very terrible service, especially when you order to-go. I ordered to add vegetable ($2) to my noodle, and whole to-go order took around 30min to be ready, and when I got back home, I didn't see the vegetable added. It was still charged though.

Very terrible service, very terrible attitude when answering questions.</review>< Pics>

<userid>111625945927304512404<//userid><review>(Translated by Google) Fu Niu Tang's shop in San Jose has a variety of rice noodles and stir-fries. Very authentic Hunan taste. As a Changde native, I am very happy to find my favorite hometown taste in the United States. Grilled fish, sixtieth birthday, Laotan chili fried chicken, and salted egg yolk pumpkin are all favorites. I recently bought their bacon, full of smoky flavor, and it is invincible. I hope that the epidemic will end soon and I can come here for gatherings with my family.

福牛堂位于San Jose的店有各种米粉和炒菜。非常地道的湖南味道。做为常德人，很开心在美国找到了自己爱吃的家乡味道。烤鱼，花甲，老坛辣椒炒土鸡，咸蛋黄南瓜都是最爱。最近买了他们家的腊肉，满满的烟熏味道，好吃无敌。 希望疫情快点结束，我可以和家人来这聚会。</review>< Name>

<Review>(Translated by Google) My favorite Hunan restaurant. The production is great and the environment is great. Currently it can only be taken out, but the taste is still good. Grilled fish, chicken, and duck blood vermicelli soup are all recent favorites. Also thank them for their donations to the community. During the epidemic, Fu Niu Tang donated a large amount of lunch boxes to front-line staff and representatives of outstanding Chinese companies.

我最爱的湖南餐厅。出品很棒 环境很棒。目前只可以外卖， 但是味道还是不错。 烤鱼，土鸡，鸭血粉丝汤都是最近的喜爱。 也感谢他们对社区的捐赠。疫情期间，夫牛堂捐出了大量的盒饭🍱给一线工作人员，华人优秀企业的代表。</Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Wild mountain pepper beef, burdock rice noodles are really delicious, authentic Hunan taste. Steamed vegetables feel refreshed, not greasy and healthy. Like shrimp steamed eggs, chopped pepper fillets. The cold dish is also very good and tastes very good. The environment is beautiful, the decoration is very elegant, and it is difficult to meet a nice and delicious restaurant in the Bay Area. I was so happy to find my own dining hall.

(Original)
野山椒牛肉，牛腩米粉真心好吃，地道的湖南味道。蒸菜感觉很清爽，不油腻，比较健康。喜欢虾仁蒸蛋，剁椒鱼片。凉菜也特别棒，味道很不错。环境真美，装修的非常典雅，在湾区很难遇到好看又好吃的餐厅。离我们公司步行的距离，真开心找到了自己的饭堂< /Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) The full-waiting Fu Niu Tang San Jose store has finally opened! Yesterday, I tasted it in the past. The store has a spacious and elegant environment, which has both Chinese classical charm and the original nature and simplicity. I highly recommend his steamed eggplant and cold peppers, and the crisp and savory syrup, so I can't stop.

满心期待的福牛堂San Jose店终于开业啦！昨天特意过去品尝了一下，店里环境宽敞优雅，既有中国古典风韵，还保持了原生态的自然质朴。强烈推荐他家的蒸茄子和烧辣椒冷盘，还有那又脆又绵的糖油糍粑，让我停不了口。</review>< Pics>

It turned out to be amazing. 1. Duck blood vermicelli soup, duck Zhen, oily tofu, so delicious. 2. Grilled fish. The taste is quite satisfactory, but not too spicy, as I like. 3. Braised pork belly with smoked bamboo shoots is also very special. 4. Beef noodles in golden soup, hot and sour, very appetizing. 5. Teppanyaki squid whiskers, healthy and delicious. A restaurant worth recommending.

这家店听说更新了很多新菜，我决定点几个菜试试。 竟然被惊艳到了。1. 鸭血粉丝汤， 鸭珍，油豆腐，好好吃呀。 2. 烤鱼。 味道中规中矩，但是不太辣，和我心意。 3. 烟笋焖五花肉，也是非常特别的味道。4. 金汤肥牛米粉，酸酸辣辣非常开胃。 5. 铁板鱿鱼须，健康又美味。很值得推荐的一家餐厅。</review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The third store in Fu Niu Tang, just opened for 1 month, the environment is very small and fresh, the table and chair mahogany is very comfortable. Favorite shrimp, steamed egg, golden soup, beef and rice noodles, fat sausage powder. The taste is very authentic and the produce is very fast. my favourite!

<pictures>None<//pictures><Time>1564287163915</Time><rate>4< /rate><Text>(Translated by Google) The taste of rice flour is basically the same as that of Sunnyvale branch. The degree of spicyness is lower than that of the customers. It is more acceptable to customers who are not very spicy. It tastes delicious and steamed dishes are good. The clerk has a good service attitude. The environment is noisy, if the music in the store is not too noisy, the selection of the Sunnyvale branch is very good~

(Original)
和Sunnyvale分店的米粉味道基本一致，辣度相比稍低一些，更能被不太能吃辣的顾客接受，味道好吃正宗，蒸菜也不错，店员服务态度好。就是环境比较嘈杂，如果店内音乐换成不太吵的就更好了，Sunnyvale分店的选曲就很不错~</Text><name>Jing Jiang< /name><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Otherwise, with the popularity here, if you want to eat, you may have to spend a lot of time to queue up for super delicious spicy food. The soup of group A is my personal favorite!

終於在昨天開門了！現在期盼有Uber eat 可以用啦！不然以這裡的人氣，想要吃到，可能要花很多時間排隊啊⋯⋯超級好吃的辣味食物。其中A組的湯更是我個人最愛的！<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

They have 3.5 servings of appetizers. Too expensive

<review>(Translated by Google) The taste is actually OK, a bit salty, but Hunan dishes are salty. Samsung is because of the price, three people eat more than 80 eaten powder, really feel that the price is not high, a tomato scrambled eggs 12 pieces. . . 😂😂

(Original)
味道其实还是可以的，有点偏咸，不过湖南菜都偏咸。三星是因为价格，三个人吃粉吃了80多，真心觉得性价比不高，一个番茄炒鸡蛋12块。。。😂😂</review>< Rating>

(Translated by Google) Very warm place, the screen of the Jiangnan water town, the hot peppers are refreshing and appetizing, the scallops are fresh and delicious, and the meat is cut into the mouth, so I can't help but eat a lot of pork, the taste of my hometown.

Sizeable wings with good sauces. Prices are a bit high but quality reflects that. Employees and management are always awesone.< /Review>

<text>Decent food and good service. The buffalo chicken fries were not the best I’ve ever tasted but weren’t too bad. Very clean place. Pretty quick service but nothing amazing about the place or the food which is why I give it 3 stars.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODoGxWE3UkniejlPBMSqcESTkknas861ocik0_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNER5WPFP4JF4_LqEZ_MDbxpZWqdWiN7hBznaO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJOBVMJsI_fP7iuGrmSggsJsu8rNtxwo9jsy6X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

I ordered $90 worth of food and none of it was edible. The wings were still raw and the tenders had the wrong sauce and even those weren't cooked thoroughly. Go somewhere else and save your money<//review>

I normally dont write bad reviews even if the food isnt good but wow i just had to this time. I ordered a 5 piece tenders with fries and they literally gave me about 2 tablespoons of sauce. The chicken wasnt even coated in any sauce, it was just what was pooled on the bottom of the box on top of the chicken being tough and dry. What they did give me plenty of was oil. It was 30% sauce and 70% oil. The fries were cold and soggy. Im very dissapointed as i used to love this place. It was probably just this one time but still not willing to take another chance.</text>

The food was exceptional. The family meal came with your wings and choice of wing sauce. Your able to switch up the flavors. It came with a basket of fries. You also get a choice of potato salad, macaroni salad, or baked beans. I just got another fry, which they weren't salted so they were plain and not enjoyable. The bread rolls were amazing and then I was given a cheesecake,  eating it now and of course cheesecake is to die for. Who DOESNT love a good slice of classic cheesecake. 😊<//Text>

Also the reception on the phone line is so cheap that it is difficult to communicate with them my order. So because of my two gripes about this place I’m going to give it three stars. If this place would buy some tortillas it would have been 5 stars. Get it together people.<//text>< Rate>

<Text>Wing empire is the best place ever,  especially the one thats on euclid and Logan. The manger his name is Carlos and he deserves his own store... Actually he deserves to be the nationwide mascot and representative because hes very professional and courteous. The rest of the staff is awesome as well< /Text>< Pics>

The wings were great the service was friendly, I ordered a family meal 25 wings everything was a great size with the exception of the sides and the Cole slaw was sour. I woulddefinitely go back for the wings but I would not go back and order any sides.<//review>

Never disappointed. Always great food and they aren’t stingy with any of the food or sauces. Chicken tenders are the best and they are huge! I used to work next to the location and always had them for lunch. Why? Because they don’t only just serve wings. Their Buffalo fries!! Chef kiss!</text>

This is my “Go To” for hardware like socket head cap screws, flat head cap screws, button head cap screws Etc. They also carry automotive fasteners and hardware. You know the plastic ones that always break when you try to remove them. They also carry the metal clips that are used on a lot of dash assemblies in different shapes and sizes. They carry some 3ft. Pieces of various bar stock, aluminum and carbon steel in a lot of different diameters. You can even get all of your laundry products there as well as kitchen and bathroom cleaning supplies!!< /text>

<time>1620233889554< /time><username>Mary Flores<//username><text>We purchased 14 bags of landscaping rock and asked for help loading them after paying for them. She said she would call for assistance and we waited and waited,  NO SHOW! I went inside to ask her again and she said again she had called! We are in our  70's and not too strong. It happened that a gardner was driving by and stopped to load the bags for us!!
This is the second time this has happened. We like shopping at Lowe's but their employees at times seem too busy to STOP AND HELP.<//text>< response>

Only reason it's 4 stars is Lowe's still needs to work on their app. The store itself was perfectly fine as it almost always is. No issues with getting what I ordered, fast and easy.< /review>

Building 3x3x3 exterior treated lumber planters is my new project and Lowe's had everything I need from the wood to the Kreg pocket hole jig with speciality screws. All of the above at a great price and with my Lowe's cc I get 5% off!</review>

Lowes had a great selection. I appreciate the help of the staff and the size of the store. It is laid out extremely well.
You can find a great selection of wood. Make sure to look at the lumber and not get crooked wood. Some wood is straight but not all pieces.
When buying concrete look at the bags. Some are broken from people running their cart into the bags on accident.
They have a great selection of nice wood. We used it to make some really fun stuff in our home.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Wide variety of just about anything and everything you could need but try to find somebody to help you? Thats  another story. I stood in the paint dept waiting for 20 + minutes as employees walked around avoiding another waiting customer, my friend and myself. I finally picked up the wall paging unit and announced over their P.A.for an employee to please come to the paint dept as customers have been waiting for 1/2 hour! They were not too happy, about that,and neither were we. The store was closing and no one ever came.
Not the 1st time on trying to get help there. It happens often, when you do get some help you get the feeling that you bothered them UNLESS YOU CAN FIND ANY OLDER EMPLOYEE, they are the ones that go out of their way and are happy to help.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80e9ad4e081c90b5:0x7db995f3fff41220</gmapID></record>

Only because I had an excellent Vet named Erik who was working in Lawn and garden. A very friendly and out going worker. Very  knowledgeable and pleasant when helping. The cashier Kristy was just as helpful and pleasant. Lowes should hire more people like these two. Way to go you two! Thank you<//Review>

One time I went in for storage boxes.  Needed help.  Found an employee in lamps area, and she said she would send someone.  After waiting almost 10 mins.  I called the store, told them I am in the store at the storage boxes and have been waiting for assistance for almost 10 mins.  She said, "your calling from inside?". I said yes and told her my story.  Help came within 2 mins</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>We purchased a couple expensive products from Lowe's in Ventura, CA.
The two gals that helped us was Melissa M. & Alondra M. in appliances and they both were so amazing , very helpful and they went step by step with everything till the very end. Till we walked out the door they made sure our purchase was 100% complete. They both deserve something extraordinary!
Very kind, considerate, and really showed interest in what they did.
Employee's of the year, both of them.
Thank you both!</Review>< Pictures>

< review>
Beware the price of appliances. Add the cost of the SERVICE PLAN into the cost. without the service plan @Lowe's wants nothing to do with you. My brand new @whirlpool dishwasher wouldn't finish it's first cycle. I called Whirlpool hoping it would be a easy fix however they needed to send a technician, who a week later didn't show up but called to say the code the machine gave would need parts that could be 4 to 6 weeks!! My call to Whirlpool  for repair was before the 30 days of delivery. The only question Lowe's was interested in was if I bought the service plan. Terrible customer service.<//review>

I live here! I'm in and out often and need this store in my life. I've learned never to need customer service. Couldn't get an employee to acknowledge you if you were on fire. As long as you know you are on your own it's a great place 10 x better than the other orange store! I'd give that place 0.<//Review>

<review>I went to lowes early Saturday, to buy washer I had picked out the night before. The washer was $200 OFF PRESIDENT SALE, and another $100 off if you apply and use their credit card, I did. I`m looking for the washer I wanted found it, took a picture, no one working the department yet so I go to the front checkout, pickup some roses go to check out tell employee what I need, it would be best if I come back after 8:15am, when the person starts their shift.
I come back around 10am after employee finishes up with helping other customer I show them the washer I'd like they check and don't  have it there....I ask any store close by has it? Oxnard has 2 so 20 minutes later I'm in Oxnard after waiting for others to be helped I tell the employee whats happen so far, she checks her inventory right there, says let me verify that we have it.  She returns and tells me they have one and its reserved. Unable to buy my new washer I went home fixed the old one, hose had came loose rubbing a hole in it cost $32 for a new hose.
Thank you lowes for saving me over $500 that day!!< /review><gmapID>0x80e9ad4e081c90b5:0x7db995f3fff41220</gmapID>< Rate>

<text>I had 2 problems with my experience. First was a lack of communication on the limitations on how much lumber they would cut for you. Second was a copy of a key I had made that didn’t work when I got home.

This is the closest Lowe’s to me at 30 minutes away & I personally choose to support Lowe’s over Home Depot if I have the choice.  After picking out all my lumber, I confirmed with a sales rep in the lumber yard that they do not charge for cuts. I was directed to the register to purchase everything first. After cashing out, I flagged a rep down to assist with the cuts to which I was told that per policy they could only do a maximum of 4 cuts (I needed probably 10). Despite multiple opportunities, nobody cared to tell me this until after I’ve spent the time picking stuff out & swiping my card. I can’t fit the lumber in my car, & I don’t have the tools to cut it myself otherwise I wouldn’t have been asking if they could do it. The sales rep allegedly asked the manager if they can make an exception but after a few minutes he came back & said they could not. So I turned around & returned everything.

My other purchase that same day was 2 copies of a house key. After getting home, neither of them worked. So after 1 hour total of driving & time spent picking stuff out that I just ended up having to return, I have literally nothing to show for it. Awesome trip.< /text>< Pics>

<review>I ordered a dishwasher on line from Ventura Lowes. Be aware that when 1 item is listed as available online, it is the display and is not for sale. This means the item is actually NOT in stock. Also, employee after employee will tell you NOT to order online. It is as if lowes.com is a separate entity. This was apparently the first problem. They have now changed delivery twice. Once by calling me and once via email.  I still do not have the dishwasher and can't tell if and when I will receive it. They are incredibly difficult to get on the phone and insist that you come to the store. If this was a COVID issue - fine. I get that. But please be honest with your customer dealings. Don't say you have it when you don't and take my money without providing what was purchased.< /review>< username>

<Text>I give Mark in the plumbing department 100 stars.  He was incredibly attentive, undistracted, professional and knowledgeable.  He was warm and charming and kind.  I would definitely return to this plumbing department if Mark is on duty.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80e9ad4e081c90b5:0x7db995f3fff41220</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Delivery was scheduled for Saturday between 3:30-7:30. Delivery was a no show. Went into the store the next morning (after trying to sort things out by phone only to be hung up on) and was told by the customer service representative that the item was in Northridge and couldn't be delivered and that there was nothing she could do. I asked for a manager. The manager says she's tried calling the Northridge store but they don't answer. What now Lowes? I'm still waiting for an update from the manager.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I come here a few days a week and every teammate is very well knowledgeable, professional and passionate about helping you , one teammate especially is Jacklyn she always greets you you the up most sincerity, and never lets you leave without you having peace of mind knowing that you got the right product, with the information to complete  your job or task , with the simplest of ease  and that to me is more than 5 stars !!</Text>

They pretty much have everything except a variety of wood types. No walnut, no maple, and a limited amount of oak and poplar. If you want pine, this is your place. Other than that, this place rocks.</Review>

Very disappointed,   went there to buy replacement screen door fabric, absolutely all the shelves were empty,  went to get 6 inch clay flower pots, again shelves totally bare. This seams to be a constant problem with Lowe's anymore.  It's not for lack of customers, just nothing on the shelf.</Review>

It was good. The bathroom's were actually open, if they had been closed, well I would not have been able to get what I needed. No restrooms is a very bad thing. Some people have a problem , and not helping that indevidual is not right. Say your from the out skirts of town and you need food or anything and you are having a personal problem, no place to go ! There for you must stay home. That's not right ! I'm very upset over this. But thank you Lowe's for the use of restrooms. It means a lot to all of us. Truly.</text>

I go to this Lowe's occasionally because it's the closest big chain hardware store. They have most of what you're expecting, but they don't rent or repair tools. Home Depot in Oxnard does if you need it. If you're on the west side of Ventura, check out G&S Hardware on Ventura Avenue.<//text>

< Review>
Where has all the helpful people gone there yes one guy out six people we asked for help even  customer service person i think it wss the manager but im not sure were reluctant to help us . What should have beena  thirty minute trip turned into over an hour passed around from one associate to another none wanting to help .  It makes you the customer feel bad for bothering them  the customer service ttold mre to go to the cashier to help us special order adoor then we got passed from one to another . Do they work there or are they there just to walk around doing i dont know what  . I went there again tonight and i walked by four or five associates did one ask if i needed help did one even look at ne and say hi nope not one ! I counted 8 zombies they call associates i have another name for them starts the zame way but different . Wake up people ypu are there to help the customer not just pass time till you can gp home and live in avirtual life<//Review>

Its a very large store and somehow I only end up finding exactly what I'm looking for about half the time.  The staff isn't bad, but when you ask where something is you often get a vague description of where it might be instead of offering to show you.  I go a lot because its close to my house, but I'd much rather go to home depot or ace hardware.< /Text>

< Review>
No one answers the phone. I placed a pre-paid online order for two items that were in stock (ample quantity) for same-day pickup. After waiting more than 24 hours and making multiple attempts to get an update, I still have not heard back.

Edit: Order was fulfilled but there is no curbside service. If you order online, expect to wait in a long customer service line to get your pre-paid items.<//Review>

<Review>Ordered a BBQ grill online and they delivered a wrong one. Tried to get in touch with the customer service and I was on an infinite automated menu loop when a representative failed to pick up the phone.

I had to unexpectedly rent a truck for a piece of furniture I bought that didn't fit my vehicle.

The staff was very courteous getting my rental request processed quickly. The same occurred when I returned the truck. The coworkers seemed to know each other well and got along which made my experience pleasurable and easy.<//Text>

This is the worst Lowes that I have ever visited.  Staff is non-existent and when you find one unfriendly and not helpful.  The order on-line system is a joke.  Eight hours and not ready as they have one person picking.  Home Depot is on top of this while Lowes Ventura provides lip service and not customer service.  Sad as this used to be a great store.< /text>

<review>Good place to get all your home improvement items you need. Good selection & they have a good floor plan. Only rated 3 stars because you will need to watch out. When you see a yellow new low price sticker, take a picture of it because the registers are not showing the new lower price. Make sure you take a picture of the low price sticker so they can adjust the price correctly at the register.</review><Time>1602372786971<//Time>< gmapID>

<Review>A wonderful store but had trouble near the back left of the building. A horrible smell protruded from a fellow shopper and it became unbearable. I had to rush from the store leaving my infant child in the cart behind. If anyone encounters a baby near the back left please return him to the local police station. Thank you.</Review></record>

Horrible place. Do not buy here. Curb pick up is a joke. I have a son with lung disease that is why i choose curb pick up. They never answered the phonem wIting outside for an hour. Finally had to go in tbe store. Workers there dont carw about you. Even pleading with tbem to bring my paid item outside for me because of health risk with covid. They said no. My email confirmation about curb pick up was sent to me. But they said they dont do that anymore. No one ever answrr the phone in this store.  Lowes in ventura is a shame. Health conpromise people are not important fir them. I guess Liwez is just for strong and healthy people.<//text>

Good place to get all your home improvement items you need. Good selection & they have a good floor plan. Only rated 3 stars because you will need to watch out. When you see a yellow new low price sticker, take a picture of it because the registers are not showing the new lower price. Make sure you take a picture of the low price sticker so they can adjust the price correctly at the register.</review>

If you are ordering something and thinking your delivery will go well and it's not going to happen to you..well think again because it will!  2 weeks delay in delivery because they put the floors on the "wrong type of truck" then instead of 48 boxes of floors we get 36 plus missing underlayment! Do yourself a favor and don't order from Lowe's!</text>

<text>I would give 4 stars because the lady really helped us; but they didn't have any of the freezers that was on display on sale. Her cumpter said the  Inventory was there but when she would go back for the ones we wanted she said nothing was back there so he ended up getting a freezer that cost way more which in the end for me I love, but my husband was a little upset but the customer service was great.<//text></record>

We find so much more here than the Home Depot in Goleta. It's massive in comparison as well as cleaner. There is an even better stocked Lowe's in Oxnard that an employee at the Ventura store told me to go to when I was looking for something. But normally, the Ventura store has what I need without having to drive farther. The traffic in the area is a bit daunting the first time you visit.</Text>

This store has by far the worst customer service. My one day project was delayed by 15 days due to their inability to track the order, dropping transfer calls, poor service in flooring department and Annie assistant manager never picking up.  They said the order would take up to 10 days from their main warehouse. After that 10th day, I started calling, somedays I would wait up to 30 mintues for them to pick up the phones and gave me the "its on it's way" answer. It took me 2 in store trips to speak to someone and ended up cancelling the order.</Review>

<text>Well organized place with helpful staff to assist.  I like the coordination between the website for Isle and Bin location of products.  There is always someone to greet you and help buttons in each department.  Lumber-wise, the products do need looked over for eyeballed for strait-ness.  However, generally you can find what you need and at a fair price.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>The local Lowe's has been coming up flat on service, inventory and products for me. Today I went in to buy wood bolts and waited 10 minutes before giving up on someone to help. They sent for someone to help too. They had 9 bolts and I needed 50. Bought the 9 bolts but will have to get the others somewhere else.

Then I went to buy a pneumatic nail gun. They had the one I wanted but the gentleman said they do not carry 3 1/2 inch nails. So again, off to another store.</Review>< Pics>

They always have what you need.  Management needs to give better training to cashier's, and inventory control.  Cahiers need to have a better process than yelling to the person next to them how to do something.  It's a time waster.  Some products were yards/meters away and not in the designated bins.  These items were moved some time ago but not updated.  The good news is everyone is very friendly and willing to help, 4 stars minus one for management.< /Text>

Went in on 1/16/20 to purchase a garbage disposal identical to the existing one and have it installed.  I was told not to buy it because the installer had to first do a $40 inspection to make sure I got the right one.  Installer came on 1/20, asked where was the disposal and signed waiver.  I called the Ventura store but no one in installtion would answer. I called the 1+800 number for clarification.  They tried calling the store but no one would answer.  I went to the store on 1/21 purchsed the disposal and cord.  I ended up having a clerk in the appliance department (no one in installation would help) complete the installation summary, paid $89 and was told that the installer would contact me to install on 1/23, nobody called.  The 1+800 customer service was finally able to have someone in installation call me and promise that installation would be done between 12 & 4 PM on 1/27.  Waited till 3:30 PM on 1/27, nobody called.  The store had me call the installer who told me that I was not on their schedule but would do the installation between 9 & 12 AM 1/28.  Installation was completed on 1/28.  I would not currently use this store's installation services for any appliances at this time.  Their installation dept. is just a Service Dept. with the key word Customer missing.</text>

Terrible experience!!  It first started off in the hardware department. I ask a male employee about a Problem my mother in law was having with her security door. I am a older female who know how to swing a hammer . I've never installed  or repaired a  security screen door so I was unfamiliar on how to repair it. When I asked the employee first thing he said was  ..  First you need to get YOUR HANDYMAN TO CHECK THE SCREWS THAT ATTACH TO THE DOOR FRAME. I LOOK ST THIS MAN AND SAID WELL.. I AM THE HANDYWOMAND !!. HE PROCEEDED to explain the entire repair job like I was   a child  . I was</Review>

Spent almost an hour at the Ventura store trying to get someone to cut me three pieces of plexiglass. The man work in the aisle said he did not cut plastic but would find someone who would. At this point I told him I would take my business somewhere else. Would’ve been a $300 sale, your clerk was unprofessional and would rather cut keys for other people.< /Review>

Generally find everything I need in stock, and the app is very accurate - I can check it first before heading there.  I've had great luck with everyone being very helpful and being able to answer my questions.  Prices are competitive to in over and other HI shops.  Love that I can take my dog in... he loves attention so it's great to take him for a trip and get some extra attention :)< /text>

Customer service at Lowe's is none existing at the Ventura store. Even one of the managers that leaves a message saying she'll call you back tomorrow as she is leaving work doesn't call back. They should just go to having employees stock the shelves at night and customers help themselves and use all self checkout. Don't even have employees during open hours cause that's what it feels like to me shopping there now. This review excludes the Garden department, where I have always received great service; especially Susie- she rocks!< /Text>

<Review>I have a hard time making myself go to this store ever since I went online to their website and had almost the worst experience ever. The store is OK I have gone there many many many times they always have what I want for more than I want to pay for it so I settle for what I need at OK price which they always have too. I think all these hardware stores get together to decide how much we can pay and then go up a dollar or 2 to watch us squirm.</Review>< Pics>

Made a purchase online through their website. I printed out a copy of my receipt has instructed and brought it with me. This receipt has a barcode on it. I felt certain everything they needed would be contained in that barcode. When I got to the store, nobody knew what to do with my receipt or how to find my items. It took them several minutes at the customer service desk to finally send me back to outdoor Garden where I came from to pick up my items. Outdoor Garden told me I needed to go into customer service. It seems quite odd that a company like Lowe's would have a website allowing me to purchase items informing me when they're available at my store location, charging me and giving me a receipt for my purchase while no one at the store location knows how to process any of this. One gentleman , Danny, was extremely helpful and pleasant. Better training on online procedures at the store level is definitely needed.< /text>

<rating>3</rating><Text>The hardware Personnel were awesome as always. 2 check out people, for 12 people checking out. An assistant manager then needed our checker to do some customer service work. He stopped the cashier for him to look up a previous order for a customer, and held us up another 4 or 5 minutes. Also, I have been on hold for more than 10 minutes at a time when calling to find out the availability of a product. If there were somebody closer, with the same products, I would be there first.</Text><time>1526996562090<//time></record>

<text>I'm afraid it fell into the  stereotypical home improvement place... where there where lots of people but no one interested in helping anyone. When you finally do find people they are busy or annoyed your bothering them. I waited about 15min to get anyone to help me, even had someone paged but the associate bearly glanced down the isle before moving on. I even tried to wave him down but he was moving too fast to even notice me. Least to say I was very frustrated by this point as my kids where losing their patients waiting. I finally just threw up my hands and moved on without the lamps I wanted. Very disappointed.</text>< pics>

It's Lowe's home improvement store what else can I say.  Miles and miles of product filled shelves and no help.   It is conveniently located in Ventura California.  Far more expensive than the home Depot in Oxnard.   The cashiers are very friendly.<//Text>

Customer service at Lowe's is none existing at the Ventura store. Even one of the managers that leaves a message saying she'll call you back tomorrow as she is leaving work doesn't call back. They should just go to having employees stock the shelves at night and customers help themselves and use all self checkout. Don't even have employees during open hours cause that's what it feels like to me shopping there now. This review excludes the Garden department, where I have always received great service; especially Susie- she rocks!< /text>

Electrical part 5+ but 50 year clear silicone caulk not much selection....also a word to the wise....stay clear of all GE caulk. I used that for years but recently it has failed to set and I have partial tubes. It seems like It Should be it does not. No more GE caulk....GE you need to reformulate and make a good caulk again< /Text>

I like Lowe's better than Home Depot but they are both terrible anymore when it comes to having 20 something registers with them all closed except 4 self serve registers with 1 broke, price check on the other and 20 people waiting for the other two. Ten workers standing around yet nobody takes the initiative to open without being told to do so.< /Review>

<review>I have had multiple bad experiences with this store. After Bringing the issues to the management the response I got was to wait for them to try to figure something out. After months, they finally figured out that I would get a refund for to help alleviate the issues I had. The Refund was less than 10% of what I had spent in the store over the time while remodeling my house. Even though the manager told me that she would be able to give me at least 10% of my purchases it I waited. Since waiting on them I have since accrued interest on my lowes card that I am now responsible for. I have always loved Lowes and used them to remodel multiple houses. These experiences have put a sour taste in my mouth about the store. The unfortunate thing is that they are the only option in my area, unless I want to drive 20 mins to Home Depot.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Went I Sunday am around 8:00 am. Wanted to see and learn about kitchen appliance packages. Terrible service. Asked the only guy in the dept for help and was basically told we were on our own to figure out what we wanted. He just leaned over the computer work station the whole,time we were there. Finally we left to find a place that had helpful employees.
Thank you for letting me share the truth.<//text>

This is the best Lowe's store there is their staff is so friendly especially at the customer service desk. They are always nice and upbeat and quick and courteous. Don't forget about their year plant guarantee. Also you can sign up for a my Lowes card and you don't even have to keep your receipt they will email them to you automatically..</text>

<text>It's clean and uncluttered unlike Home Depot. We found the gas stoves were on sale and the lady who helped us sold it to us for the store price, which is lower than the website price. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star rating is because of the one month wait for delivery.<//text><user_name>George Cabasug</user_name>< Gmap_id>

Only thing is you have to chase down customer service and there is one woman at customer service who never very helpful.< /text>

This is the best Lowe's store there is their staff is so friendly especially at the customer service desk. They are always nice and upbeat and quick and courteous. Don't forget about their year plant guarantee. Also you can sign up for a my Lowes card and you don't even have to keep your receipt they will email them to you automatically..</text>

Looking to kill fleas without toxins? Diatomaceous Earth is a natural remedy to Killing fleas in your home. Safe to put on your floor, carpets, and couches and safe for humans. Don't forget to go all the way to the walls where your vacuum maynot reach. Beats putting all those advertised Flea medicines on your pets and getting ZERO results, just enormous monies spent.</review>

<Review>Went today to get a few things. Asked 6, yes 6 employees where things were. No one knew. No one offered to help. Basically no one gave a shi*. Tried calling to speak with a manager and no one answers the phone. Awesome customer service... not.<//Review>< Pics>

Pulled up to the store, parking lot semi empty thinking service should be great not too many customers. Should be a pleasant experience which was not the case. Was greeted as I walk in, ask where the plumbing section was proceeded on my way get there needing assistance no one to be found. Came across a garden associate asked for assistance and said not my department but I'll get you someone. Asked an associate in paint got the same response. Walked towards lumber then the back aisle ended up back in plumbing still one to be found. This was My first shopping experience at Lowes. A store with no too many customers but yet can't get any service as well. Home Depot far from perfect but there at least I get some type of service.</Text>

They typically have what you need. Glad the social distancing is setup at the checkout and customer service counter now. I do find that it tends to be a little overcrowded at the entrance and exit points.< /Text>

Not bad, lots of parking, and believe it or not you could actually do your shopping without a jungle of families in your way. I know Lowe's wants shoppers?</Review>

<review>I gave it 5 stars because this is good as Lowe's gets compared to some of the other ones. They do try pretty hard but sometimes it just doesn't happen. Regardless going to a Lowe's in Ventura smokes going to a Lowe's in LA County any day.<//review>< pics>

<review>Terrible service over 4 visitis trying to complete one project!!!
Given the wrong information on availability of product, go to,pick up find out there is a 5 day
Special order, select another product, purchase, get to the job & it is not at all what I was told.
Return product, not given the option of cash/exchange, service rep just automically processes the $$ returned to my acct making it impossible for me to re-purchase another product for 3-5 days.
Return to store, discuss issues with manager Annie, who was very helpful, but then when I was ready to finalize the purchase, not one service rep would find the Manager, page the manager insisting on trying to help....WALKED OUT EXTREMELY disappointed with the lack of customer service, lack of product knowledge and resistance to locate management when requested.

<text>I don't know how this place stays in business. I buy one product from them almost every day. The shelf is regularly unstocked, and god forbid I inconvenience an employee to get one down from overstock. Typically 10 to 15 min. Later they'll huff and puff their way over, and Take another 10 minutes to get a latter. This results in me being late to my jobs, and having to calm down my customers. I've spoken to the manager, assistant manager, and a hand full of employees. No one cares. Corporate America at its finest. I'll be talking with Ace hardware on Monday about stocking the product I need.</text>< pictures>

<text>The paint department is horable customer service.  The guy couldn't match a simple color from the photo. JHON ignored me for 10 minutes then said I would have to pick something out of the swatches.  Even though I looked three times . I will not be coming back for the paint ever again.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>The last several visits to Lowe's have been a dissappointment for my husband. Two times now, they are out of the item he wanted to buy, and can't say when they will have it. They aren't specialty items he needs.
But today's visit was really surprising . My husband went to get some tape, they were out of the kind he wanted. I picked out some replacement slats for vertical blinds, and asked for an associate to cut them to size. She said that the machine they use to cut the blinds has not been hooked up since they rearranged the store. I asked when it would be hooked up, thought I could come back in a couple of days. She said the machine would not be ready until December 31st! That Lowe's is waiting for the electrician to come, and when he does, he will take care of all machines at one time.
Are you kidding me?! What horrible customer service, to rearrange the store without a better plan than this!<//Text><GmapID>0x80e9ad4e081c90b5:0x7db995f3fff41220< /GmapID>< user_id>

Their staff is somewhat knowledgable but often relying on other departments which know nothing of neoghboring departmemts to cover breaks for the one "professional" department staff. No one seems happy to work here except the ones in brown vests visiting from other Lowes for stocking purposes. Speaking of stock, always out of what you need and disorganized. Short cut 3/4 in copper tubing has been out of stock for a while. Save your time and go to Home Depot.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80e9ad4e081c90b5:0x7db995f3fff41220</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Manangment and customer service is TERRIBLE. They need some serious training or they should be replaced.
We ordered a door from them that we had to cancel after A MONTH because they screwed up so many times. Ended up in our favor. GO TO CAL WINDOWS AND DOOR in downtown Ventura, much better service, and selection.

Round 2: Ordered decking materials to be delivered Friday, after some confusion, they assured us Saturday, and now we won’t get them until Sunday.

IF YOU ARE ON A TIMELINE, DON’T USE THIS LOWES. This is our third project that they have delayed because of poor communication and disorganization. Thank god we don’t have a contractor involved.</review>

Self check out had half of the four registers not working, and the other two were CARD ONLY.  Who the heck came up with this idea that the cash paying customers would go extinct??    While the only two person-operated registers had lines that blocked the front walkway....way to go!!<//Review>

It saddens me that a store I used to get excited about going to,  now fills me with disappointment when I hear the name. Bought a shower door that someone returned and parts were missing.  Frame was cut. This happened twice in a row. Drove from Santa Barbara  to Ventura. Then with the second one There was no way I was driving all way back to Ventura again I'm on the clock time is money. So I asked them when they made a delivery could they just pick it up and take it and they wanted to charge me a $90 fee. So I had to call corporate in order to get the shower door picked up at no cost. Then I was in Ventura doing a plumbing job, I'm just a Fix-It person is not a plumber. So I needed a valve for a faucet and I wasnt sure which one. Waited a half hour and 3 people came and I knew more than they did..
Ok once I get, twice it happens. But three people, three trips. Three separate instances. I'm done giving them chances</Text>

Worst customer service I have ever experienced.  You could wander around in this place for hours, even days, looking like your lost, and you will never get a customer service agent to ask you if you need help. Been there, done that. They will walk right past you looking like they are busy or on a mission. Home Depot in Oxnard is no better. Go to either one only if you know what you want but don't expect to get any help.<//review>

<Review>Horrible. Took 40 minutes to get a salesperson. Then he proceeded to take the man first. I called salesperson on it and he called me a liar. Then he refused to serve me. Had to call a manager for help..another 20 minutes. Needless to say...I WILL NOT SHOP AT YOUR VENTURA STORE AGAIN!<//Review>< pics>

Horrible.  I ordered flooring and was told it would arrive within a week.  It's now 3 weeks later and nothing.  Every time I go to check the status I'm told it will be there on Friday. Just got off the phone and they said that the order is still not sent.  Can't move in to my first house cause I'm waiting on the flooring.  Horrible experience, will never use again.<//text>

Unfortunately there aren't many, if any, local hardware stores left around here any longer thanks to places like Lowe's. I hate going there and the only other option is Home Depot in Oxnard. Can't recommend either.</Text>< Pics>

<date>1501115768653<//date><rating>1</rating><text>Lowes has a 90-day refund policy for most of what they sell. We purchased custom window blinds through them. Lowes doesn't make custom blinds themselves, they job it out to 1 of 3 outside vendors, in our case, Bali. The Bali blinds are very poorly constructed and started to fall apart within 1 week of use. Unfortunately, this happened more than 90 days after we purchased them, because the room was being remodeled, and the blinds sat unwrapped in their boxes while the remodel was being finished. Lowes acknowledged the actual timing of use, and even acknowledged that the blinds were poorly constructed, but stuck to their policy anyway and offered not one penny of refund for a very expensive purchase that we're now stuck with. Much as I like Lowes for convenience & selection, I cannot shop there again or recommend them to anyone, especially not for anything custom-made from the flooring or wall covering depts.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

We do not regularly shop at Lowe's because it is normally not convenient, but last weekend we did shop there for items needed for our new home (after a very disappointing experience with a competitor) oh shall remain unnamed). On Sunday, my boyfriend left an item outside on a table where he had stopped for some lunch. He called and asked that it if anyone turned it in I could stop on my way back from LA, but we felt that it was a long-shot, since it was decorative. On June 26 at 5:15 PM I checked at Customer Service and talked to a very nice woman who was very sympathetic. The item had not been turned in and she called a manager to see what could be done for me.  The manager said I could just go get another one - a $25 item. I do not know her name nor the manager's but Lowe's has certainly earned our return business with their customer service. Thank you!</Text>

Horrible Lowe's. But I suspect its the same everywhere. Better buy extra of what you're working with! Because when you go back they will either be out,or restocked with a different/cheaper version of whatever it is!

Consistently BAD customer service at this store, and I am there at least once a week. If you can actually "capture" someone to help you...chances are they will have a terrible attitude or treat you like you are an unwelcome guest.</Text>

This Lowe’s is so understaffed it’s pathetic. I had to wait 15 minutes for someone from appliances to help me. Don’t go here if you have to be somewhere else on time!</Text>
