The location, decor, staff and room were perfect.  It felt like home after coming back working all day.  The room had ample space to separate out my work area from the rest of the living area.  The dishwasher, washer and dryer were an unexpected and welcome bonus!!< /text>

This is a great location for someone visiting UCLA. The hotel has great parking. The staff are very friendly. The facility is very clean and well maintained. The courtyard is beautiful. We were upgraded, and the suite was very nice, with plenty of space.<//review>

This is a hidden gem in Westbrook village. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, clean and located in the quiet area of LA, between Santa Monica and Beverly hills. The staff is incredible, we upgraded our room the same day, everyone from front desk to housekeeping was very friendly. They have a really nice rooftop with tables and seating area. They have a garage conveniently located. We will be coming back!</Review>

This place is so beautiful.
Amazing place to recover.
The nurses  all of the staff were very attentive, catering to your every wish.
They took great care if me till the very end of my stay.
I met the owner on my last day and she just as kind and helpful as her staff.
I love each and everyone of you.
Thank you is not enough but that is all I have.< /Review>

Absolutely fantastic place to stay. A hidden gem that is still building out it's property, so the best of yet to come.

Customer service: top notch. They know your name from the moment you walk in. Front the room service to the director, they respect and treat you like royalty.

Rooms: very clean. The European architecture is a welcome change from the typical modern-looking hotels. Very roomy, full kitchen, washer & dryer, and a fantastic bed.

Amenities: They are building up a restaurant, Continental breakfast, and more! They have a rooftop area with fresh fruit that you can pick! It was raining on our visit (but that didn't prevent us from enjoying it!), but this would be amazing during a sunny day.

I will absolutely stay here again and look forward to they growth as a company. A membership setup would be ideal.<//Text>

Very spacious rooms and suites, great concierge/front desk service, wonderful in-room amenities, fantastic location, central, surrounded by great restaurants, markets, and shops, and gorgeous rooftop views! A must go-to hotel for anyone visiting LA - I highly recommend.</Text></record>

This is probably one of the nicest hotels at which we have ever stayed.  We had an early-morning appointment about 1/2 a mile away and I thought it would be nice to splurge a little and not have to deal with Los Angeles freeway traffic early in the morning. So, we drove to L.A. the night before and stayed here.The hotel itself was amazing.  Check-in was a breeze and all of the staff were friendly and welcoming.  The hotel has its own parking structure with roll-up gates, so the car was quite secure.  I think they have the fastest elevator I have ever ridden.  We reserved the Premier Suite (wow).  It was like a small condo, with a dining area, a living room, and a kitchenette.  It is definitely set up for long-term guests.  There were two balconies; one overlooking the city street and restaurant scene with a view of the mountains to the northeast.  From the wood floors to the huge walk-in shower and walk-in closet, this place was amazing.  There was a Kurig coffee maker with an assortment of coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. The bed was very comfortable.  There was a huge flat screen TV with a full DirecTV lineup.  The room was quiet and the climate control worked well without keeping us up at night.There are lots of restaurants withing walking distance.  Shopping was pretty much closed down due to the over-hyped virus, but that wasn't the fault of the hotel.If you're going to Westwood, stay here!</text>

Also very quiet and within walking distance of lots of restaurants and Target, Trader Joe's.

The use of space is really impressive as they fit an entire kitchen, dishwasher, laundry in this place and it's all totally functional. Everything is really nice quality and comfortable. Tons of channels on TV.

Was disappointed that the first day I had no hot water for my shower and had to wash dirty dishes left in the dishwasher to have a cup of coffee.</Review>< Rate>

There are some recommendations on a couple of things but the staff really made our stay the most pleasurable. We stayed in the Work Loft (industrial style). Great space, but could use a couple of enhancements: not all light switches controlled items, no paper or writing utensil at the desk, phone service when in the living room / kitchen was very spotty (had to go to the window for best service), the closet upstairs was unfinished and had a lot of utilities exposed.. I honestly thought it was a door that wasn't supposed to be open but that is where the safe, iron and clothes hangers were. Also the front entrance was a bit hard to find. Other than that, good amenities, beautiful room-top terrace and incredible staff.  Troy was extremely helpful!<//text><resp>None< /resp>< Pictures>

Plaza La Reina is both a luxurious getaway and a most comforting stay when you are away from home. The staff is what has drawn us back time and again, as they are all accomodating, friendly, attentive to our needs. The folks (shout out to Troy, Taylor, and Philippe, and AJ) always went above and beyond in ensuring that we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay and consistently did so with genuine smiles. The hotel is immaculately clean, and we felt comfortable letting our toddler crawl in the room (which we've never done in other hotels). The room's kitchenette and washing machine/drier were convenient for us. The prime location is close to many local restaurants and other necessary places like Ralphs (grocery store) and Target. During a difficult time in our lives, the staff and our stay as a whole helped our family tremendously, and we'd recommend this location to anyone visiting Westwood.<//text>

<Review>This is a great place to stay if you want space and quiet with great restaurants and stores all around. It’s very unassuming from the outside with a very no frills lobby and although you don’t get a pool or fancy amenities it makes up for it by being able to get a full on apartment including washer/dryer, dishwasher and full on kitchen. Everything was super clean and I had a really relaxing time.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>From the moment we set foot inside,  the warm and friendly staff made us feel at home. Our family stayed for over a week, and by the time we left we felt like we were leaving behind family. We have returned again since our initial stay, and the staff couldn’t be more friendly and hospitable. This hotel is a hidden sanctuary within the bustle of LA. A tip of the cap to AJ and Troy who are always willing to go the extra mile for us. I enthusiastically recommend Plaza la Reina.</review></record></dataset><record>

Great place to stay. Best part is you are across CRAVINGS CAFE, next to iPic theaters. Great food, healthy and fantastic customer service. We enjoyed everyday their breakfast and lunch.

Awesome stay!!  The hotel is so cute and quiet. The bed and pillows super comfy. AND THE STAFF IS SO NICE! Customer service award! Really personalized service and attention that you don’t get at larger hotels. Love the vibe here. The rooftop terrace is amazing and relaxing. Will come back when I’m in the area for sure👍🏽<//text>

I stayed there once previously and mentioned that it would be very helpful to business people if the hotel could provide the means to scan and email documents. At my most recent stay, several months later, they had added this capacity. That is just one example of their desire to accommodate customers needs. Beautiful large, clean, modern rooms, complete with small “Kitchen “ area with coffee/tea maker, sink , dishes and glassware, refrigerator and dishwasher. For the quality of the rooms and hotel generally and  great Westwood location, by LA standards it is not expensive. As our daughter, her husband and newborn live in Westwood, we expect to be visiting from our home in Florida , every two to three months and will not stay anywhere else. We have travelled extensively both in the U.S. and internationally and this is one of the finest hotels we have experienced. You will not be disappointed.< /Text>

This place could not be more perfect. Exceptional customer service that exceeds resorts that literally charge 10 times the price. Very spacious suites that make you feel like you at at home in a Spanish/Italian-style Villa. Oh, I love this place SO much! Even the showering/bathing products are high end. The design of the suites uses high-quality woods, linens, curtains, bathroom tiling, and furniture. There is also a comprehensive supply of cooking utensils, pots, plates, etc.</text>

Not only was this hotel in the perfect neighborhood to walk and explore but its close to everything.  We only stayed on night but left our car there to walk around and see all of the sights.  Lovely staff and enjoyed the junior suite with the mini kitchen in it.  We will return..... and I recommend it to all....</review>

Everything thing about this hotel is wonderful.  The rooms are huge with really comfortable beds, a large separate living room and a small bar-style kitchen.  I wish we didn’t have to leave!  The hotel staff remembers your name and is great about giving recommendations.  Everything you need is within walking distance.  Even a Target and Whole Foods.</text>

Stayed here for one night on Oct. 9 for a business trip to UCLA, to which the hotel is very close.  The best way to describe my stay was as if I was visiting a boutique hotel in Europe.  The front desk and manager called me by name from the time I arrived, and were very available to give information about the room/hotel and the area.  The room was beautiful.  It included a kitchen set up, pretty much everything you'd need if you were there for an extended stay.  The bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was immaculate, beautiful and very functional.  I highly recommend Plaza La Reina.  The way that the building looks from the outside does not do the inside justice, but once inside I experienced one of the best hotel stays in recent memory.</Text>

Greeted by being berated by staff for using Orbitz to make reservation- I advised that Orbitz discounts was the only incentive discounts found  to be able to afford the hotel.  More directed to long term stay; falls short for get away weekend staycation- no onsite anything (no  jacuzzi, pool, Fitness, restaurant, bar).  Kitchen present but  no cook utensils, dryer  takes forever to dry  clothes since electric ( 2hours for cotton items),  Large junior suite room but no lounge around couch, just 2 rigid straight chairs, purchased premium room with terrace and disappointing to just get a French door peep out without  a  sit or stand zone, had to rearrange furniture for working desk, eat station and still be able to see TV.  Shower space very small despite a very large bathroom space.  no hair blowers.  Bottom line: pricey boutique hotel in Westwood that could have hit the mark for excellence but falls short to be worth the cost for the stay given so many nearby hotels that can hit the mark for same or lower rate and offer full hotel services.<//Review>

<Text>The reception said the hotel has no door keeper and he was with customers so not at his desk when we check-in. He said those with a very easy tone and not even an sign of apology so I believe it is very common for them to lock their customers outside their hotel in the middle of the night and this is the way they treat customers “feels like at home”

+more:

- Garage was locked as well as front door around 11PM. No one at front desk. If you decide to check-in late at night, don't choose this hotel.
- Called hotel at 11PM but no one answering.
- Only one robe in the room. I booked room with two people.
- One of the cups in the room was broken.
- Bath water is way too cold.

In short, it was a terrible experience.</Text><gmapID>0x80c2bc81c95c48f9:0x8341e978a4695b28< /gmapID>< rate>

Very pleased with staff - very friendly and helpful and went above and beyond my expectations (Troy was one of those representatives). The rooms are spacious and well furnished. Could have used some more light in shower area and a door hook. I had trouble with unlocking some of the gates with my keycard and the thermostat also didn't work as expected. However overall I am very pleased with the hotel and staff and would return in the future.<//text>

This is a somewhat secluded exceptional place to find care and tranquility inside Los Angeles. An exceptionally unique state of staying overnight.<//text>

Loved the Plaza La Reina. Put up several VIP guests there and the service was impeccable.  Rooms are huge and spotless. Location is ideal at the edge of Westwood - quiet but steps to everything.< /review>

<review>Parking is not free, no bar nor restaurant, but everything is literally within walking distance. As in you cross the street and have the choice of 5 restaurants! Target and Trader Joe's are 5 mins on foot. No kidding! A museum, all your favorite stores, bakeries, banks, salons, pubs and bars... can't believe I haven't stayed here before. My go to hotel from now on!</review>< pictures>

Fantastic place and a great find. Perfect for our family as we were looking for something with a little more space, that provided some home comforts whilst remaining close to everything. Plaza La Reina delivered on all fronts.<//text>

Beautiful boutique hotel close to UCLA. Unfortunately, there was a leak in the bathroom that they were never able to fix during our stay. They said it was condensation from the air conditioner, but it dripped all day and all night.Other than that, the accommodations were very nice.<//text>

Made reservations. Called front desk..I had an awful experience with an extremely rude front desk gentleman named Mathew who had a surprisingly terrible attitude. I WOULD BE EMBARRASSED IF he were to represent my hotel guests first interaction with a "well -rated" place. Cancelled. Always better out there.< /Text>

<Text>Very accomidating. The concierge was helpful and knowledgeable about local entertainment (I'm visiting from out of town). They have free passes to the local LA fitness, if you feel like working out on your trip, and the gym is pretty good! The room is well-organized and it has a kitchen, which not many hotel rooms do. The view from the room is also nice. There are a lot of places to go eat or shop within walking distance and the Westwood area is nice overall. I'd highly reccomend staying at this hotel if your business is in the area, or even if it's not so close!< /Text>< user>

The place seemed nice, the location is good. The staff in general were nice but the problem was the old woman with bleached hair, she was very unprofessional, rude and doesn't belong in that hotel. I have no idea how she was hired. Avoid that woman and your experience will be just fine.< /review>

<Review>I recently stayed at plaza la reina on Saturday the 28th. Had a terrible experience, the guests above us were banging on the floor and sounded as if they were running around from 11pm -2 am. We called the front desk multiple times to report the issue and ended up checking out of the hotel at 2 am and were promised that Troy the front desk person would report the issue to the manager for us to get a refund. We get a call today saying that because we stayed so late that there is a no proof we called in to the front desk. We drove from Santa Monica to San Diego at 2 am because we couldn’t sleep. Also we booked the hotel with a travel agency who told us they were dog friendly and multiple people working so us bring our small dog in the hotel. We even had someone come into our room to fix the beeeping dish washer and then the manager called to tell us that we had a dog in the room which is not allowed. All around this hotel is a joke and will never be staying there. Please save yourself the headache and book some where else. Nadia the manager is a joke and Troy can’t keep his word. Already reported to our bank who was notified when we left and will be getting a full refund. Honestly please beware of this hotel and avoid at all costs.

Unser Zimmer war sehr großzügig und ruhig. Ein Ausblick war nicht vorhanden, da die Fenster direkt zum daneben gelegenen Bürohochhaus gingen. Dies störte uns aber nicht, denn tagsüber waren wir sowieso unterwegs. Zum Frühstück sind wir einfach über die Straße zu Denny‘s. Überzeugt hat uns die zentrale Lage zwischen Hollywood und Santa Monica.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Cozy as living in a hacienda. Beautiful, personal little facility in Westwood. Very safe area, possibility to park in the underground car park. Very helpful and friendly reception. Clean, huge room, large spacious bathroom and everything was very clean. Washer and dryer are available in addition to a fully equipped kitchen. Toiletries from Etro. Housekeeping and cleaning only on request in the morning. Nearby is the Museum The Hammer, many cafes and pubs and UCLA. The Plaza la Reina is a good choice and highly recommended.

Gemütlich wie in einer Hacienda wohnen. Schöne, persönliche kleine Anlage in Westwood. Sehr sichere Gegend, Möglichkeit zu parken in der Tiefgarage. Sehr hilfsbereite und freundliche Rezeption. Sauberes, riesiges Zimmer, großes geräumiges Bad und alles sehr sauber. Waschmaschine und Trockner sind neben einer voll ausgestatteten Küche auch vorhanden. Pflegeprodukte von Etro. Housekeeping und Reinigung nur auf Anfrage am Morgen. In der Nähe befindet sich das Museum The Hammer, viele Cafés und Kneipen und die UCLA.

(Translated by Google) A great hotel I would recommend to families with a private car park and an elevator for the room along what passes on the risption Preferably have a Los Angeles car specifically what you can move from a non-car

Waller Park, Santa Maria's hidden treasure located near the Santa Maria golf course and the Airport off Broadway South.. it offers Frizby Golf several water ponds sitting areas (reservible pick-nick areas) with BBQ's... Several for large gatherings contact parks and recreation restrooms and huge play areas Kidd friendly playground equiped and ball diamonds ... T R E E S are free for the breathing !!! The coastal on shore breezes as well year round it's advisable to bring a sweater sweatshirt or light jacket it can get breezy and cool .. be kind to older folks ... Pathways to walk and all the birds & squirles to enjoy ... Weekdays are quieter for walks or wheel chair strols.<//review>

<Text>Bathroom wasn't clean, no place to hang your purse. The host was not trained properly, the food was pretty good. The chef had no personality and the waiter was too attentive in the beginning and then towards the end we could never find him. Overall the 2 stars are more because of the ambiance then anything else. That place needs to be cleaned.

This rating comes with love as this was a favorite spot of ours and I wish it to be again.< /Text>< UserId.>

Do not waste your money. The place has horrible ventilation. I understand that it is hibachi, but the entire room was smoke. After 40 minutes of waiting for sushi we found out the server never put it in. The sushi finally came with no discount. After waiting an hour a chef finally came to the table. The chef was great and had a lot of humor, but the food was very bland. The only thing I could taste was garlic salt. Once the bill came we found that they charge for rice. It wasn't even included. I absolutely love hibachi, but this place isn't worth the price you pay.<//review>

2 stars for the Hibachi chef. The owner Winnie was rude and rushing us. She threw our soup just light enough so it wouldn't spill. The floor was super sticky. The soda tasted like the filter on the fountain needed to be changed. Around the grill was old stuck and crusty food. The grill itself was clean. I'd go back for the food and show, but the restaurant needs a major upgrade in ownership and cleanliness. Next time I'll make the trek to Concord and go to Benihana. At this rate Winnie gives the Hikuni chain a bad name.</Review>

A lot of reviews have said that this place is not clean. However, I definitely did not experience this during my visit. Yes, it was very quiet. But the food was amazing and the portions were of good size. The server was very kind to a small child with us. The only problem I would point out is that they have no children’s menu. That said, there’s always side orders, which is what we did.<//Text>

Paid just under 20 for lunch buffet. Great atmosphere. Food was fresh & proper proportions, especially plain salmon nigri & special roll spicy salmon topped with crab.

Skip the salad, bland and boring iceberg lettuce.< /text>

<review>This restaurant used to be a fun, clean place to go.  Not any more!  We were seated at a Hibachi table.  I quickly noticed how DIRTY the table was!  While the cook was getting ready to prepare the food, he stuck his spatula in a crack in-between two pieces of stainless steel trim on the table. That crack hadn't been cleaned in a long time!  Everywhere you looked (i.e. the floors, the exposed piping, all the joints on the table) there was greasy filth.  One of the eggs the cook was spinning around (part of the show) broke prematurely on one of these filthy cracks....he didn't skip a beat as he proceeded to scape the egg from the filthy crack back into the fried rice!  GROSS!!  Stay away from here!  I had to give the place one star or it wouldn't post.< /review><resp>None<//resp>< rating>

This place used to be fantastic! I'm not sure what happened but it has really gone down hill. It's a great concept for a restaurant but you can tell they are cutting corners trying to save a few bucks. My server did a good job but never smiled and looked like he was dreading his job. The food was only mediocre and not worth the price. I hope they improve soon because I would really like to go back some day.<//text>

<date>1468045608828<//date><review>If I could rate 0 stars I would. So my chef, Peter, early on in the meal made me a target. He sprayed water in between my breasts and the sorts. I tried not to make a big deal because it was my roommates birthday dinner and I didn't want to ruin the dinner but it was wildly inappropriate. Once I thought the worst was over, Peter blew me away by trying to throw a piece of broccoli between my breasts and then asking me to "open my shirt". I felt very violated and spoke to the owner who replied that it was a joke and refused to reveal his last name. I am highly disgusted. This is my second bad experience here. Avoid this place at all costs. No class at all.< /review><rate>1</rate></record>

Went there for lunch. Credit  card machine was broken and wanted to write down credit card information and id information and use it later. I have spent over over $800 in the past 3 months and this bill was only $60. They tried to keep my credit card and would not hand it back until I threatened to call the cops. I asked them to put it on a manual cc slip and they did not have it. They have lost all credibility as a restaurant with me I will never recommend this to anyone.< /review>

The only reason i gave this one star was because of the chef. This place was the worst. Our waiter argued with me about ordering side salads and soup. Saying "they come with the meal." I explained that I was not ordering a meal. To which he continued to argue I could not order the appetizers. When he finally grasped the gravity of the situation he added the soup and salads to the Bill. The waiter then forgot to serve our appetizers and ignored us for the rest of our meal. When the bill came he argued that I didnt order appetizers; then he claimed he did not hear me order it. When I pointed it out on the bill he did a complete 180 with his attitude. Be aware they also tried to add an 8% gratuity on a bill for three people.</Review>

The ratio is really 50/50. I suppose you cannot ask for too much from an all you can eat sushi restaurant, but if you want consistent quality sushi I'd recommend elsewhere.< /Text><pics>None<//pics></record>

By far the best Japanese restaurant I've been to. The food was great as well as the service! The chefs make the food right in front of you and they make a show out of it to keep you entertained. And as a bonus, they leave you with large portions to take home with you.<//text>

Went for a family member's birthday ans was told that they dont do corkage by the host/bartender but then once we sat down and saw it was on their menu .Went up to ask and he tried to charge me twice the menu price. Not what i expected.
Then, the server was a little more worried about getting us out of there vs helping our experience in their place of business. But the chef was polite and kept the show going. Delicious food and well now i know why there is a hiring sign posted on the front door.< /text>

< Review>
we were frequent visitors to this place from its inception. The service was great,
the staff was attentive and the food was pretty good.  They have since instituted the
"all you can eat" theme and it has all gone to hell!
The service is horrible, and the communication is even worse. The turnover of the staff
is a direct reflection of the problems at Hikuni.  We dont eat there any more.
I have complained to the manager but its apparent that he doesn't care.
I am dumbfounded when i hear people rate this place as good. i suppose if you are conditioned for sub-par service and food this maybe your kind of place.
i wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemies!</Review>

Ate there in March 2018. Table had dried noodle stuck to it. Floor was sticky. Rice was hard....definitely not fresh! Sushi looked & tasted as though Thousand Island was poured over it. Yuk. Will not eat there again.</text>

Terrible! Stay away! Last weeks before new owners. Filthy, low quality fish, and poorly made rolls filled with horrid imitation krab plus lousy service. Hope the new owners will be better.</Review>

Use to love coming here but yesterday will be the last time. This place needs a complete overhaul. Filthy horrible smell of something like dirty bathrooms permeated the place  as soon as we walked in (and even as we were leaving), probably because they just opened and the cooking had not yet begun to hide the smell. Greasy chandeliers, dirty bathrooms, chipped old and worn out plates, unfriendly waiter.< /review>

First time I went with new owners and was not impressed. The quality of the sushi was worse than when it was hikuni. The service was slow and they have half the amount of suchi on the menu. Prices were also raised.< /review>

I like the way they cook in front of you with the whole entertainment show, flipping knives amd things and making flames, the whole routine is entertaining and fun. It would be great for a first date, the cooking show would be something to talk about and break the ice.<//Review>

<review>Bad service. Limited to 1 glass of water unless you find a water faucet to refill your glass. All you can eat sushi is a waiting game. Table has to share a pencil and menu which adds to the waiting for ever experience. So if you don't mind terrible service the food is usually good.< /review>< rate>

We put our names in for a reservation 2 days before we came in with a party of 9. When we arrived at the restraunt we were told by the hostess that we would have to wait 30 minutes to be seated because they "had a lot of reservations" that night. Waited 65 minutes to be seated, even tho we had the reservation.

We asked the manager why we were made to wait so long even though we had a reservation - he said that a reservation doesn't secure us a table, it just puts our name on the list to be seated. Absolutely ridiculous and was not disclosed to us at the time of reservation. When we told him we should have been told about this, he told us "go to BeniHana"

Not returning here ever again.<//Text>

If I could give this zero stars I would! Ate there for the first time last nite. DOn't waste your time or money! The place is filthy! We had a coupon book for buy one entree get the other $15 off!. Mysteriously it disappeared during our meal and when the waiter cleared up the extra plates. 3 witnesses and the hostess all verified they saw us with the coupon book. Waiter was belligerent and said he was going to call the police when we politely asked if he took it by mistake. Asked for manager. No help at all. No coupon no discount. Worst experience ever and the soup was horrible, rice sticky. Hibachi? Go elsewhere where you can enjoy your meal.< /Text>

Food was unbelievably terrible and Waitress was undeniably rude!!! I would give a zero rating if there was one. The restaurant give a bad reputation to Japanese cuisine. No wonder there were only about five customers total for the whole restaurant during lunch rush hours.< /text>

Teppan style cooking. The chef was very entertaining. Food was cooked as ordered. Fried rice... I'm spoiled by Benihana. I would recommend them.<//review>

She was yelling questions to the hostess across the room as we were ordering. "Did you tell these people that they could get a habatchi meal sitting in a booth?  She yelled. She then explained that they only have one cook now and that was simply impossible.
The food that was approved by the waitress was finally delivered. 3 out of 3 of our meals was discussing. We were starving so we all ate the one meal that look sort of ok.
Unfortunately the person in our party that ate a piece of the chicken teraki was violently ill all that night and next day.
A trip to the bathroom as we left showed an open door to the kitchen. No surprise...FILTHY!!!
Do not eat at this restaurant!!!</text>< pics>

A few years ago this place was amazing. Sushi was fantastic, the service was great, and they brought you you sushi in a timely manner. Now, however,  that has been totally turned around. The all you can eat sushi has become more expensive for less quality. Some servers piratically throw your glass of water on the table when you arrive and then never re-fill it for the remainder of the time your there. But the part that really gets me is the wait time on all you can eat Sushi. The past 5 or so times we've been there, one plate of sushi takes 40+ minutes to make. They also lose your order sometimes, and then when you ask the server why, they begin pointing figures at their co-workers (I even had the manager start pointing fingers at his own employees. Can't be the manager's fault, right?). Last time I was there, their excuse was "We don't have that product in stalk at the moment." which is perfectly fine. I understand. What I don't understand is why it took you 40 minutes to tell us that, and now we have to re-order and wait another 40 minutes. I don't want to sit here for 3 hours for only 3 plates of sushi. Sorry, but I will never go back.< /Text>

I am giving 4 stars because I love sushi, and this place delivers! Granted, we have been here many many times in the past, and the service is up and down? What's up with that?
Look, I've read a lot of reviews from others, and can see why communication can seem confusing at best. That said, I have seen a glimmer of hope with renewed staff, buy it appears that the bottom line is thier only concern. Maybe I'm wrong, and please stop me if I am, but the turn around here is like a roller coaster?
Maybe a little off track,but I am trying to address many pro's and con's.
For a while, my family and I went trekking for other sushi places in and out of the area, but as it stands, we ended up right back here....
Maybe I am a little more patient than others, and with that I look for an attempt by the servers trying to get it right. The ones that don't, get what's owed to them.
Look, it's not that difficult. Approach your customers with respect, and a smile. Drop by every few minutes, and you'd be surprised at how people (customers) react.
In closing, I would like the owners, or managerial staff to read these reviews every once in a while, that way when we return, and the service has pleased us, well - you get the idea.< /Review>

<name>Rebecca Poz< /name><Text>Well let me start off by saying the food was good....However, we ordered off the all you can eat menu...my boyfriend ordered 3 rolls and so did I...he finished 3/4 of his plate...and I only 1/4. When asked for a to go box, waiter said you can't take left over home...this was my first time in this Restaurant and let me tell you the last time. We pointed out to waiter that the menu didn't specify your not able to take home what is left on your plate...he said yes it does, but what it did say, is all you can eat is in dining and sushi bar section only. Waiter then reply's I will get manager, again we say show where it says that...waiter reply's "I don't care". Manager comes out and tells us this menu incorrect...I was shocked of how we were treated...we paid for our food and what was left should of been ours to do what ever we chose to do with it...so wasteful..when manager got the owner on the phone he yelled and argued that it was on the menu..What ever happened to customer service, where the customer is always right? They could of easily said "we apologize for the misunderstanding, let us take our food, "THAT WE PAID FOR" and simply said keep it in mind for the next time we visit...</Text>< response>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Went here for the first time for my 56th birthday with my family. Called ahead for preferred waiting list. Seated within 5 minutes of arriving.Opted for the the Habachi dinner. Enjoyed everything about the dining experience. The food was great. Very reasonable prices, ample portions, and timely service. The Chef was very skilled and funny. Excellent job by him. Our waiter was attentive, professional, and friendly. He seemed genuinely to enjoy serving us. After our meal, three of the staff brought a green tea ice cream dessert with a birthday candle and spoons so we could all share. I think it was the Tempura ice cream. The dessert was excellent and not a morsel went to waste. They also enthusiastically sang happy birthday. Nice touch ! Was our experience an anomaly? I sure hope not. We will certainly be returning again and I'm telling my friends about it. Glad we decided to go here instead of the plain old steakhouse. Thank you Hikuni for one of the best birthday meals I've ever had!  :-)</review>< Pictures>

The sushi is good- not great, but for people on a budget, it's a great way to get your sushi on without breaking the bank.
I am gluten intolerant,  and they are really helpful and concientiously when preparing our sushi plates.<//text>

BARF! I don't normally write reviews, but this restaurant inspired me. I took my girlfriend out for a Valentine's dinner. We wanted a place close to the Summerfield Cinemas so we could catch a romantic movie afterward. This was the most un-romantic experience I could have imagined. The service was about as thoughtful as cowboys herding cattle. The chefs are charismatic and funny until you see them repeating the same humor to the next table, and the next, and the next and then it dawns on you that they're unhappily puppeting the same script over and over. Then (and this is my biggest pet peeve), they leave you sitting there waiting for your check forever as if you're a captive - only able to leave until they decided you can. Lard, MSG and low-grade steak set my insides into serious upset and rumbling. The indigestion was audible throughout the entire movie theater. Holding in nuclear gas eruptions during a romantic movie? OMG it was awful. When it was all done, it came to a $100 dinner. Save yourself the awful experience and avoid this restaurant.<//Review>

<text>The waiters and waitress' are great, but the way things work at the restaurant is atrociously sad. I have only eaten their sushi and so I know nothing about the hibachi/steakhouse. It's "all you can eat" or "eat all you can" sushi based on what they say, but to me it is ALL YOU CAN EAT RICE. If I wanted to eat rice as the majority of my meal I would have gone home to eat and pay a fraction of my bill. I don't recommend sitting at the bar because their tempura chips have spilled on my food before. The chefs take their time making their sushi and seem like young inexperienced chefs due to how all the fish is pre-cut. My girlfriend and I ate our order in less than ten minutes and the quality of the fish was as if it was purchased at Costco. We waited nearly an hour for just some sashimi and 2 rolls. They try to serve everything all at once so it makes you get full much faster than usual because the more there is to see the lower your appetite. The girl next to us got their order before we did and she came in ten minutes later after we got seated. I have had a better experience at both inexpensive and expensive sushi restaurants and this in my opinion was the "third time's the charm" experience. Third time I went there and the last time I will go there. DON'T ORDER THE NIGIRI because the amount of rice they put is size of three gumballs. So basically for the price of 16.50 USD you can have all you can eat rice with small of amounts of fish purchased from Costco that could possibly take nearly an hour to make. At least the waiters were apologetic about it. Didn't really see much sympathy from the managers though. You are better off going to In-N-Out. It's not sushi but their quality is much better and you don't wait for a long time.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x8084462ad774d76f:0x7a1538b401f87d47</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

My Dryer stopped working.   Thought it was the belt and called Michael at Repair Best.  He responded to my call right away,  set up appt for the next day! He was on time and courteous.  He fixed my Dryer in less than an hour,  it was the belt Thank Goodness!  He had a new one in his truck.   He didn't try to upsell me or overcharge.   His price was actually lower than I'd seen online for Dryer belt repair.  I'm very happy to now have someone to call for appliance repair in the future.  Thank you Michael!</Text>

<Text>We've now used RepairBest Appliance Repair twice. Each time it was very quick, easy and efficient to set up an appointment with them. Each time we were helped by Michael who showed up on time as promised. Not only was he polite and friendly, he was very efficient and diagnosed the issue with our washer appliance. I would not hesitate to have Michael come back and work on any of my appliances which include stove, oven, dishwasher, refrigerator, washer and dryer. It's not always easy to find someone you can trust. I've even told my neighbors about them.
Hope you don't have an appliance repair need, but if you do call them first.</Text>< pictures>

<text>I highly recommend Michael. I received a call back within minutes after initially calling, got an appointment very quickly.  Michael repaired my leaking Sub Zero refrigerator quickly and at a fair price which he quoted prior to the work.
Michael also did a great job on our Viking oven and LG dryer (he had the dryer part already to go).
Good price, great service and a friendly knowledgeable tech.  Now that I know Michael, I can't imagine anybody better.
Thank you, Michael!<//text><resp>{'time': 1614708232639, 'text': 'Thanks'}< /resp>< rate>

Our dryer had not been working well for several months—temp not hot enough, or no heat at all. I’d called another repair shop and, although very professional, I didn’t think they’d spent enough time trying to diagnose the problem.  They recommended buying a new machine.

I saw some very stellar reviews of Michael’s business on a Google search and decided to try him.  I’m glad I did.  His first of two visits was spent trying to source the problem.  He spent about an hour and felt sure he knew what was causing our issues—a failing gas valve.  He ordered a new valve immediately and, once installed (second visit), the dryer worked perfectly.

Michael was super-thorough and very professional.  He spent a lot of time thinking the problem out and saved us having to purchase another dryer.  His charges were very reasonable.

I recommend him whole heartedly.

Thanks Michael!< /Text>

My tenants called me on a Wednesday morning complaining that the washing machine wasn’t functioning properly.  I called Michael at RepairBest and he came out (on time) the very next day.  He took apart the machine and quickly diagnosed the problem.  He sent me pictures and explained exactly what was going on.  We discussed the various options and ultimately decided that it would make more sense to replace the machine than to repair it.  He left without asking for payment for his time or advice.  Michael was very professional and left a positive impression on my tenants.  Posting this review is the best way I can repay his kindness.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<review>When I called for they to come and look at my dryer. I was told the repairman would be at my house in 30 minutes. He came little faster than 30 minutes. I told him the dryer was making a noise and it was shaking. I told he it made loud pop noise before. He thought it was the bearing or belt. When he opened the dryer it was not that but fan in the dryer. He said he look in his van to see if he had a fan that would fit. It not he would need to order it, luckily he had one. He quoted me a price and I said yes. He had to dismantle th dryer to get the fan out. He had to cut it out with little power tool. It was a lot of work when he got done. He did not change the price that he quoted me on. From the time I call to time he finish all in two and half hours. Thank you<//review>< pictures>

Our commercial refrigerator (Frigidaire) was not cooling properly.  George arrived on time, was polite, and was incredibly professional.  Offered a diagnosis of the issue (which required a part be ordered), took a small deposit, and returned the next business day to complete the job efficiently.  Confident with his with his work, I asked him to take a look at the GE fridge we keep in our pantry.  It was leaking (seemingly from the freezer compartment into the refrigerator compartment).  George diagnosed the issue.  He had the part on hand in his truck, efficiently made the repair, and voila!  In an age where it is rare when people take pride in their work and are happy to take advantage of consumers, what a pleasure it is to find gentlemen’s who are skilled and take pride in their excellence, but are equally committed to providing exceptional customer service.  Looking forward to sharing info about this business with friends and family.  They will definitely be our family’s go-to appliance repair service team. -Kevin< /text>

<review>My LG washing machine would not drain.  I called LG for advice and repair references, but It was late in the day and LG was closed.  I looked online and called a few local repair shops and selected RepairBest Appliance Repair by luck.  Michael was professional and scheduled a visit for the next day.  Michael arrived on time the next day with his colleague.  They immediately went to work and in no time found the defective pump.  They had the pump assembly on-hand and replaced it.  I was promptly back to washing clothes in less than 24 hours.  It has been almost two weeks and everything is working fine.

Great work Michael!  Good value!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><user>115413977106112401758<//user>< gmapID>

<Text>Dead refrigerator is a bad thing.  Michael arrived on time (about 30 minutes after I called!).  He had the part and had us up and running in about 20 minutes, for a fair and reasonable rate.  We’ve used him before (washer, dryer, dw) and will use him again!< /Text></record>

Charged 100 dollars to put on two washing machine knobs. Broke down two weeks later. Solved the problem by stuffing plastic bags into knob. I have to pay to get the machine fixed ultimately.< /review>

<Response>{'time': 1614711263071, 'text': "Dear Matthew I suggested that you order these knobs for your dryer yourself, you didn't want to do it. I spent my time looking for those knobs and installed. After installation, I showed that everything works fine, but after two weeks I do not know what you did with them.

I think that everything will be fine with them.\n\n$ 20 was the handle for your dryer and $ 80 is my time I think it's not much because other companies charge $ 80 just to come.\n\nDid you take the time to write negative reviews instead of ordering the handles for your dryer yourself and there would be no problem.\n\nThanks for your unfair review and wasted time."}<//Response>< gmapID>

I originally contacted RepairBest Appliance to fix my refrigerator as the freezer was working fine but the fridge part was only cool.  MIchael came out and he not only did not fix the problem but a new one was created.  The night of the day that he came to my house, an extremely high pitch squeal woke my family up in the middle of the night (think the sound of a cat being tortured) and now my appliance sounds like it's breathing on a ventilator.  I called Michael back and on the following day, he arrived and said I was in need a control adaptive timer that is no longer being made.  He said he would look for a replacement part and get back to me in a couple days.  After texting him several times, he finally responded with simply "Not yet" .  No indication of whether he was actively looking for the part or suggesting an alternative solution.  Bottom line...my refrigerator is not fixed and I am looking for another repairman to finish the work that Michael obviously couldn't.  Stay away from this guy and his company!</review>

<text>Our washer was leaking water from the bottom, even without washing anything we spotted good amount of water coming out, my wife had put a towel there and overnight it was completely drenched. I then proceed to shut off the water valve and that did the trick so I know this is beyond my knowledge and quickly search for a pro to fix it.

I called Mikael because of the stellar reviews that he has on Google and Yelp! If you go to his website from Google's link you'll find a link to his Yelp it has 200+ 4.5 star reviews, if you know online reviews, they are brutal even if you have 90% customer satisfaction, so with those numbers I didn't hesitate to call and he picked up and said he would come the next day between 1-3pm.

He showed up on time and within 5 minutes of talking to me he gave me his diagnose of what the potential issue would be. He then opened up the washer and it is exactly as he described and he happened to have the parts as well so we were able to get back to our normal lives as we've got 3 kids and we wash things religiously during covid and home schooling!

He also help us replace the dryer vent tubing as it has a rip on it without charging us. You can tell he is proud of his work and these are the professionals you want to working for you.

I have only written a handful of reviews ever and you can just tell Mikael cares and he knows his stuff with 16 years of experience so I highly recommend him for any appliance repair, he is also very fair on price, we're so glad to have found him and know we can count on him in the future, thank you Mikael!<//text>< Pics>

This company is absolutely the best! There have been a few times that I was desperate to have an appliance repaired and they came right away! Other times that I’ve use them for different old appliances that I have they came and fixed them when other companies told me that I would have to get rid of them! Michael is very sweet and caring. Their prices are  very competitive and reasonable ♥️ Thank goodness I put them in my contacts!< /text>

Michael was very helpful and knowledgeable and fixed our Kenmore oven for a fair price. I feel better working with a local company who came out next day, rather than Sears which tried to sell me a monthly warranty. Sears call out fee does not go toward repair either.</review>

For only $15 extra their tech was at my door. Yep, you heard  me, they send techs out to repair all sorts of apple devices.
Within an hour my iphone 6 was as good as new.
Very professional and fast service.
Will be definitely contacting this cellphone and computer repair company for my future repairs.</Review>< Pics>

The repair will pay for itself as my fridge wasn't closing all the way, causing a big spike in energy costs keeping the contents cool. Only negative was they were Yankee fans, but actually the nicest Yankee fans I've met.< /review>< Pics>

Our experience with Repairbest Appliance Service was great. We had a problem with our Sub Zero fridge and scheduled an appointment with this company. Technician named Mikael arrived on time, diagnosed and repaired the problem with our refrigerator quickly and the charge for his service was very reasonable too. Great service and professional honest people!

My Bosh dishwasher was not working properly for couple of weeks. I called Repairbest Appliance Service and was able to schedule an appointment at the time which was convenient for me. Mikael, the technician, was very nice and informative. He quickly diagnosed the issue and ordered the parts. He came back the next day and fixed my dishwasher which is working like new again. Thank you Mikael for providing an excellent service! I will highly recommend this company and make sure you ask for Mikael to do the service.< /review>

<text>I called on a Monday afternoon, and got a service appointment for the following day, no problem. Good news already! The technician that showed up was professional, quick, and competent. The ice maker was broken on the Bosch fridge, he anticipated what the problem was going to be and had the part with him already. He was very polite and explained what was wrong, what he fixed and that we should have ice in a few short hours. We do! I'd say five stars all around!

I would recommend Repairbest to anyone. I called them this afternoon with broken, non-cooling Kitchen aid side by side refrigerator. Lady on the phone was very helpful and tolerant while I was calling around and trying to find someone to be at my home. Eventually I had same day appointment and tech happened to have the right part in his truck. That was a nice surprise!
Hour later had my refrigerator cooling and working like it never got broken.
Thank you repairbest. I will be definitely using your services again.<//text>

Did what was required, came in time, took it apart like nobody's  business.  Even showed me how things operate and how to put it back together. i have learned something new and interaction with a tech was nothing but the pleasure. Got my appliance fixed and happy!

It's been very hard to find a quality appliance repair company in Pasadena. I've contacted various services around the city, before choosing RepairBest Appliance Repair. Last week our air conditioner went out in when the temperatures hit over 90 degrees and this company was able to dispatch a technician to our door within 3 hours. I spoke with a customer service representative named Anna who immediately took down all the needed information and assured me that the problem will be promptly fixed. This company has struck a cord with me in particular because it is a family business and they make you feel like your problem is their own. I've never felt this type of commitment and dedication to serve the customer with any of the local service companies. Highly recommend RepairBest Appliance Repair, especially if you live in the Pasadena area.< /text>

Needed emergency help with my Sub Zero refrigerator last weekend. Had numerous guests coming  over for  bbq. Tried to call few companies but, most of them were not available for service.. Than i called to Repairbest appliance company . What a surprise it was when Anna  pleasantly answered the phone and offered the same day appointment. It was a Saturday of 4th of July, afternoon . Oscar  stopped by within an hour from the time i set appointment up. He diagnosed my unit, replaced the  thermostat  and left us with a working refrigerator. We are very thankful for such a quality service. 5 star it is!< /Text>

<Text>Oscar is the man! Came on the same day , right on time after we called to Repairbest appliance repair company in Pasadena  and made  appointment for our Samsung  side by side refrigerator.  It was beeping none stop the whole weekend , giving up some kind  of error code ,it was  driving us crazy.  He was very quick in his diagnostic. He definitely knew what he was doing.  The problem was the door and robber seal system going around it, it would let cold air escape,causing the error beeping, he replaced the rubber seal strip around the door and we finally get to enjoy a quite. Thank you Repairbest appliance  for such an amazing technicians. Keep it up!<//Text><Rate>5</Rate>< Time>

<review>Had my Macbook pro repaired with this company.
I spilled a coffee on the keyboard, ugh, typical i know.
Panicked ,called in , had Anna set the same day appointment up, Daniel arrived on time , it took 10 min for him to diagnose it and 30 min for repair and my device was as good as new.
Couldn't be more happier , the price was definitely right , much lower than most of the iphone, ipad , Macbook shops out there.
I used their mobile services ,that was awesome !
Will definitely use their services again.

FALSE ADVERTISEMENT
Their ad says "free service call" but they actually charge $39. If you choose to have them do the repairs they credit the $39 towards the repair cost. Sneaky and misleading.<//review>

Pleasantly surprised  by this company.
I have always used the same guy for my appliances and other problems but, he wasn't available at a time. Did some research and found (Callforfix/ Repairbest)
and gave this company a shot. I am glad i did , Denis was at my door within an hour, at that point my fridge was defrosted and all my groceries was getting ruined. He puled my fridge found a freon leakage, sealed the problem and i had my fridge getting cold again after 24 hours.
Got some warranty on his job and never felt so satisfied about a local company such as Repairbest Appliance Repair
Thank you guys.</Review>

Awesome company!
Right  before big B-day gathering our Amana bottom freezer refrigerator was over freezing everything in there. We just did our grocery's for over $200 , fresh organic veggies and fruits won't last long , couldn't imagine the worst case scenario than that.
First we called to our  repairman whom we used for years but , he wasn't around and we start calling to local companies , the fastest service we have been offered  was by  Repairbest , they sent tech  named Vadim out the same day.
After diagnosing it  , and find out that  thermostat needs to be replaced. He checked the stock  and told us that he will be back in 3 hours and guess what , he was back on time  and replaced the part and left us with perfectly working fridge.
Couldn't be happier .
Thank you Vadim and Repairbest!
Will definitely call again.</Text>

<Review>Spectrum is the new kid on the block in terms of cell phones and moving to them was nothing short of a nightmare.

First, it is important to know that Spectrum is now allowing customers to “BYOD” – bring your own device. However, they only allow certain iPhones on the BYOD plan. Since my iPhone 7Plus was tethered to the carrier, I knew my device would be exempted and I would need to either buy a device from Spectrum or purchase from the Apple Store. So, I stopped into the local Spectrum in Hemet to ask some questions. I quickly found out that Hemet Spectrum is not yet equipped to provide cell service and are referring customers to the Moreno Valley location. They did provide what information they were able and even called the Moreno Valley store to ensure they could answer some basic questions. They did confirm that any of the new iPhones could be brought over to Spectrum.

I drove 45-min to the closest Apple Store (Temecula) to purchase the new iPhone XR. That excursion took about 5 hours between the purchase, transfer of data, and drive. This does not include the hours spent since iCloud did not transfer over any of my app username or passwords (I’ll save that for Apple’s review).

It took me about a week to make it to the Moreno Valley Spectrum (a 45-min drive) to get the phone connected, a regretful delay. When I showed up on Monday morning, I was told that over the weekend, Spectrum was no longer able to provide service for iPhone XR, XS or XS Max. What!? I returned home disappointed and perturbed.

I had to return the phone to Temecula and the Apple store was gracious in allowing the return. I tried to google a phone number to make a simple call to Spectrum in Moreno Valley, simply to determine if they had the iPhone XR 128G in stock as I was now without my iPhone. Apparently, the store does not accept customer calls and no one at the main Spectrum number knew how to reach them. Customer Service wanted me to order the phone and have it shipped, which was not what I was wanting.

Next day, I returned to Moreno Valley Spectrum to see if they had any phones in stock. Turns out they did, but not the color I wanted – but hey, I had already spent so much time driving back and forth, I wasn’t going to let color stand between me and my new phone. Black it is.

From there, it was a breeze. The new phone was set up easily and quickly. The phone purchase and even the startup of my son’s iPhone X (BYOD) was no hassle at all.

Now for the reason Spectrum received 3 stars after all the hassle of changing my phone and about 10 hours of hassle (drive time, purchasing/returning phones, research/investigation, etc.). Christian was great and knew his stuff when transferring over the phones but the real star is Norvella S.

Norvella is amazing! She is the one who made this whole process bearable. I may have given up transferring my phone to Spectrum had it not been for her (& some cost savings from Verizon). The first time I showed up to Moreno Valley Spectrum, Norella was the one who assisted me. She was kind, friendly, smiled, made eye contact, laughed and made a connection with me as a customer. She apologized for the inconvenience and gave me a card with her name, promising that if I returned, I could present the card and skip the line.

When I returned to the store today, Norvella was helping another person but when she looked up, she immediately recognized me and smiled. She allowed me to skip the long line and got right down to business. Norvella is the ultimate customer service representative that any business would want. Because I am a manager myself, I stopped on my way out to ask for her manager to tell him what a great employee he has in Norvella.

Incidentally, the manager told me that he is opening a store in Menifee (yay! – closer to Hemet) and that Norvella will be working there. So, if you move your cell phone to Spectrum, look for Norvella at the Menifee store starting May 2019.</Review>< time>

Literally one person working the counter. I just had a conversation with a group of ppl all saying they’re cutting the cord.. if not to simply never have to come back here again... it’s worse than the dmv. I swear I’ve been here for 20 mins and they’ve called one number.
The only positive was some poor woman finally gave up and gave me her number... it’s 26</review>

<text>Due to Covid19 you must stand away from the counter about 4 feet and staff stands an additional 4 ft away from you. Privacy is non existent. Wearing a mask is ok but its difficult to hear the employee. It's just a lousy customer service atmosphere. The employee wore her mask under her nose and I told her it should be covering her nose to be useful. Spectrum prices are outrageous. Hello. We are in a pandemic. No one is working but Spectrum is making tons of money. I'm canceling as soon as the kids move out. Spectrum is a greedy monopoly imo. Shame on them.</text>< GmapID>

<Text>This place is updated, but their workers need to be fired. Most of them are young adults who were less than helpful as if they had no clue what job they applied for. And the older women /supervisors were just as clueless. I called spectrum and had wayyy better service. Also, the spectrum stores in riverside or Menifee are absolutely better.

Nice location and helpful people... but you will wait forever.  Which is weird because there are so many employees standing around.  You would think they would be working thru the line a little faster. This location has a little kiosk to pay your bill... but I don't see many people using it. I guess they rather wait in line.< /Review>

This place always has the longest waiting times ever . There’s more than 11 customers waiting to be attentive during and there’s only two employees helping out. There’s obviously more than two employees here that aren’t doing their job. I saw more than three other female employees coming in and out of doors who see all the people in their lobby waiting to be helped and go back in their rooms to lock themselves up or just stand in front of a computer but not helping the customers. This place has the WORST customer service and wait times!</review>

<Review>The rude welcoming of what seems to be a bouncer at a dive bar to yell at you to sign in is very unprofessional from such a big corporation as Spectrum.  It is a shame that as the company expands into different services their customer service gets worse by the minute. I immediately turned around when i saw a homeless person asleep in one of the benches inside the waiting area. Avoid this place at all cost. Save you the Headache and try to deal with Spectrum online or through the mail.</Review>< GmapID>

Went to this location on 2/28/19 to pay the bill. The wait was long as usual so I saw a pay kiosk machine and decided to pay at the kiosk the bill was $160.90 and I paid $170.00
Because the machine said it don't give change I paid over. The machine verified the account,address, and phone number as soon as it took my money it prints out this ticket showing the amount owed and that they payment was cash but don't show the amount. I take the ticket to the counter and the nice gentlemen told me it was because I am Spectrum Riverside not Moreno Valley. Then I was told once the store closes at 8pm
They can open the machine and verify the transaction and that they will call later that night. 48 hours later still no call or credit.
DONT USE THE KIOSK IF YOU DON'T LIVE
IN MORENO VALLEY.......<//text>

I was in shock. I have been a customer of spectrum for quite some time now. Before spectrum it was time Warner. I'm wondering why didn't I receive some type of mailer or flyer notifying me of cell services that they now offer. I just switched from sprint to AT&T and would have given them my business. Other than that they have been great to me....<//Review>< GmapID>

Trash switching back to Direct TV better service more channels and cost less. Their internet sucks. Paying 150 and literally only got 7 channels I actually watch everything else is locked. I was promised I could pick 15 premium channels and what do you know I didn't get them. I'm gonna cancel and switch back to Direct TV. Spectrum is just trash!!!!!!!!!!<//Review>

Horrible customer service , waiting list of about 16 people,  they have 2 employees working with 1 customer at a time the  “manager” is just walking around on her phone, instead of being a manager and jumping in and helping her team that is behind and not just helping the team but how about for customer service purposes as that’s why I assum you are a manager.... there is other employees walking around and no one is doing anything to help customers out quicker. It’s ridiculous this place is ran horribly. Been waiting 30min to drop off some equipment.< /text>

Totally ridiculous!!!!!  The payment kiosk has been down for well over a month and the reps have no idea when it will be operational again.  Was told it was some sort of software issue.  I understand why the people I talk to decide to cut the cord and not deal with Spectrum.  The wait time is horrible and there are several employees holding idle personal conversations while the customers wait.  The company need to look into providing a better customer experience.  Low-customer effort is the key to maintaining customers.< /Review>

I asked to cancel my service. I had to. One rep tells me I have $80 something to pay to restore my service and she told me no other increase will occur. And I asked that specifically because I was going to need a few days to get the money. So, I take the time to come up with the money. Then I try to pay today. Then they tell me I have to pay $187.00. The supervisor tells me there is NOTHING she can do. She even told me Corporate would not help. I tried to explain that I was misinformed, but she still said she could do nothing. I felt SPECTRUM was UNFAIR. I only needed them to tell me they were going to keep increasing.  I wish there was someone else to go to. Or another service. I don't like how I even got PUSHED into SPECTRUM when I had Time Warner first. What should I do next?<//Text>

Been with this company for a year honestly all I could afford as a student now that I could spend a little more I am leaving this company it has slow speeds for an outrages price my contract or deal was up so they bumped up my bill from 53-72 wanted to see if any deals would be offered by the customer service rep said I was moving service and they said to drop off equipment and you will receive your bill when you do. Surprised they didn't value me at all went to another company  within 5 minutes got twice as fast internet for the same 53 dollars and cool extra features. Called back day of to drop off equipment the store rep tryed offering me a great deal 219 for 5 lines of family cellphone plan  internet TV.... Sadly to say didn't take it was in contract with new company which they said they would pay off. so next time I wish the 1800# would have been as helpful would have stayed with this company for that but to late. Thanks spectrum store, try better next time1800# cancellation representative</Review>

It was exceptionally busy. We signed in and then ask to sit with a gentleman at his table. I asked him how long he had been waiting and he said 1 hour and 47 minutes. We decided to leave. It has never been anywhere near that busy any other time I had been there. Had I of known I would have made an appointment.<//Text>

I had seven cable boxes connected called them to add wifi they came and connected the wifi but disconnected 5 boxes they had my order all scrood up then they were charging me for gold packet and silver packet at the same time for i dont know how many months and when i told them about it they said i was reimburse for that and my bill was never went down it even went up more there just a bunch of liers you do have to keep an eye on your bill and question every charge but even if you do they will give you the run around and make you believe they took care of it when they didn't and still keep charging you hoping they can rip you off a little longer before you catch it again😠< /review>< pics>

The service is awful, they offer a great  deal, but it isn't true. I had to cancel it, and they didn't inform me the process I went to return the equipment and I found out that they didn't cancel it although I paid in full the day I call to cancel. Think twice before you get the service.<//Text>

Maybe schedule a few more employees during the later part of the Day on Thursday and Friday,  because that's when people get paid looking to pay their bill, iust to cut down wait time<//Text>

The amount of money I pay doesn't equal to the quality of service nor the time it takes to speak with someone. Very poor customer service and I will be take my money else where! ✌🏿<//Review>

Went and waited in line for almost 20 minutes as employees had good time not helping people, only to find out they could not help and had to call the call center. What is point of having a store rhat can not help its customers.<//Text>

<review>Ohhhh the many things that I can say about this place. We all hate Time Warner Cable mainly because they rip us off, have disruptions in service, and fail to innovate. The United States which is one of the most advanced industrialized nations in the world has slow average internet speeds mainly because of greedy companies like Time Warner who are collecting cash but are not upgrading the infrastructure necessary to have faster connections.</review></record>

<Text>There are 8 computers at the counters, meaning, the ability to have 8 service reps helping customers. Instead, they have 2 or 3 sloths moving very slowly. I was the 6th person in line and it took almost an hour just to pick up a modem. This place is worse than the DMV in terms of wait time.<//Text>< rate>

Time Warner was bought out by Spectrum. I cannot  begin to say  how dissapointed I am with the new customer service. Their customer service is ridiculous no surprise they make minimum wage. They treat their customers terribly. Let's just say I never stated to cancel my Time Warner account yet , their customer service took the freedom  to do such. However,  this area is being monopolized by companies. So irratating as their employees are ill prepared to deal with customers.  Moreover, their actual store lacks professionalism and empathy.  Their customer service  reps who make minimum wage power trip on their consumers. Totally  unacceptable!  Hoping for better management ASAP!!!<//text>

Lousy service. I did everything online to avoid the lines and wait.  I got there and still had to wait for an hour while employees kept going in and out of the doors but only had 1 or 2 employees servicing customers. I counted atleast 9 or 10 different employees but only 2 at most in front while about 12 people waiting to be helped .Sad service<//review>

<Text>I'm typically not one to post reviews at all, but I couldn't let this one go....Customer service here is "ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!!".  I was a Charter/Spectrum customer in the past before the merger, and was quite satisfied with them before.  However as you can see with several other reviews posted here, the service now is extremely poor!!  Ordered internet service over a week ago, and still no one has bothered to show up to install it....despite being lied to on multiple occasions by multiple people, who seemingly don't know how to do their jobs.  If I could give negative 5 stars, I would.  Do yourself a favor, and find another provider!!  They're the WORST!!!<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Worse phone customer service EVER! I spoke with some dude in India for 40 minutes and his name was "Harris Parker". But my point is that he wouldn't let me cancel my order. I asked him 4 times to "please cancel my order" and became agitated. Told him I'd rather walk in my local office and he got MAD! I explained I couldn't understand his accent and preferred someone here in the states. Then he exclaimed that he's "based off" Florida. I asked him "you're in Florida? " he said "Sir, our corporate headquarters are based off Florida". JUST DRIVE TO THE LOCAL OFFICE!< /Review>

Spectrum are frauds and have submitted a charge to all of my creditors even after I disputed these charges with a collection company they use called IC System Inc several months ago explaining that I had not stayed at that location for years prior to the charges and my dispute went unnoticed. The charges has now affected my credit I am discusted with this company.</Text>

So far, I am not impressed.  We moved our service from Frontier.  When the modem/router no longer worked (after 2.5 months), I had purchased one to use for the internet, however, I still needed a landline modem.  I went to this store to pick one up and return the defective device.  They coded it wrong.  So in the meantime, no service, had to wait for someone to show up.</Text>

The worst service I’ve ever had in my entire life. DO NOT GET SPECTRUM. They frequently shut down for “maintenance” and their customer service is absolutely terrible. First time I tried to call to set up appointment for internet installment and the woman left me on hold for 30 mins. By time she actually got back me she told me that their call center had shut down for the night and that she’d call me the next day for more information on my account/appointment. Needless to say she never did. Eventually I did get the installment done and it’s been the worst decision of my life. Videos never load, my ping for games is terrible, and sometimes my internet cuts out completely. Don’t give this company anymore business.< /text>

<review>The service guy was helpful and knowledgeable.  Yes the line takes a little time but it is worth the wait to talk to a local human.  And if they staff more people than they would just rase their fees, so all in all for what's it us there for it works.  If your in a hurry there is a automat kios to do simple things or do like the rest pay online.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I was skeptical about their service, but got an internet package and the service is good, no lag and calling for service is adequate.</Text>

Their Is always a line and some of the associates are jerks. I think They do it bc They think They can. I understand some ppl owe money their but they act like the customer owes it to them personally . I don't like most of the associates that work the morning. Most of them seem like they woke up on the wrong side of the bed.</text>

One of the WORST store I had ever been to in my life. People getting kicked left and right and treating people like animals as I arrived people were waiting in front of the store confused on why the door is locked 15 minutes prior to closing. I get some strange weird person behind the door stating the the doors automatically lock at 5, I look at my watch and its 4:52pm so I showed them the phone and it was 4:53pm and I was like sir it's still 8 minutes left and he said no the doors are locked and they can't open the doors then 6 minutes later as I was on phone with time warner and I was more confused and now feeling abused or kicked. I had no choice but to take this to the highest level of complaints and I can't watch people getting kicked or spitted on by this store or security or manager who ever is not caring for time warner customers but instead they are treating us or the customers like Sheep's. People don't know how to go file complaint or feedback so based on what I seen when I first arrive they this store should have more negative feedbacks if people knew how to access feedbacks websites or systems to make this store a true quality store rather then a place where Sheeps site outside for hours< /text>

There service has gone down hill, my service has been pixelated for months, then this month they send me a bill $30.00 higher then normal and tell me my promotion price has ended.
There service wasn't worth what I was paying, I'm sure as he'll not paying more for it.<//text>

for what they charge for service & equipment as many customer as they have
their cost to service clients compared to their gain they should be able to at the very very least hire more customer service personnel it is very sad that only the smallest percentage of humanity notice this kind of things, sad very sad !!!!< /Text>

(Translated by Google) L e n t o s !!! It is not possible that they have 2 people attending and add that when they finish with a client they start to look at the cell phone looking for a way to take more time, more than 40 minutes waiting and that I only had 5 people in front of me, I understand that I did not They are waiting only for me but faster they have 16 people inside the premises.

(Original)
L e n t o s !!! No es posible que tengan 2 personas atendiendo y agregale que cuando terminan con un cliente se ponen a ver el celular buscando la manera de tardar mas tiempo, mas de 40min esperando y eso que solo tenia a 5 personas enfrente de mi, entiendo que no me estan esperando solo a mi pero mas rapides tienen a 16 gentes dentro del local.</review>

(Translated by Google) If I could give it a half star I would, I came to return a team 5 minutes before closing and they wouldn't let me in. Not to mention that the security officer didn't even make an attempt to ask the staff since they were signaling from inside the office not to let me in ... Absolutely lousy customer service.

(Original)
Si pudiera darle media estrella lo hiciera, llegué para devolver un equipo 5 minutos antes de cerrar y no me dejaron entrar. Sin mencionar que el oficial de seguridad ni siquiera hizo el intento de preguntar al personal visto que desde dentro de la oficina le hacían señas de que no me dejaran pasar... Pésimos en atención al cliente definitivamente.< /review>

Not to mention, he was hacking up a lung the entire drive - we’re in the middle of a global pandemic, sir. Aside from that, he was falling asleep at the wheel and veering off the road. The drivers lack of regard for our safety was appalling. You’re better off using Uber, or walking.<//text>< Pics>

<text>Cabs are clean the drivers are nice but the make receptionists when you call for a cab very unprofessional, they put you on hold multiple times , for 10 and 20 mins out of time , they have poor communication, instead of giving you the real estimated time of arrival they give you the shortest time to make it sound good . They had me waiting over an hour for me to keep calling back the the man on the phone kept telling me 20mins I don’t really care about the wait just let me know that I will be waiting that long so that way it gives me the option to continue to wait or find another alternative for transportation at that moment ... again the cabs are clean and the drivers are polite but the Male receptionists are unprofessional... thank you for your services..< /text>< GmapID>

<review>When I called they said they would be there in 20 minutes I called after waiting 30 minutes and asked how long it was going to be the very rude unprofessional Middle Eastern boy who answered the phone told me it was going to be 20-30 minutes so that’s an hour needless to say I got an Uber and 1 hr 26 minutes later this person called saying they had arrived 🤡🤬💩👎🏻 DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY</review>< Pictures>

He shockingly thought it was ok to drive 80 mph down residential streets, text and drive, and go through numerous stop signs. By the way, mr. Taxi driver why was it $80 to go a total of 4 miles? I was fearful for my life, and thought I would never see my campus again. Next time, my friends and I will be using uber, or walking.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>New to Fairfield, Can. & I have to say these cab drivers who drive for this Company is the most RUDEST divers I've encounter ever!!!! ( MORE THAN ONCE) Just because I say I'm NEW to Fairfield, doesn't mean I don't know the basic way on the streets, & the drivers feel to drive fast as hell, won't allow you to notice they're taking long routes for a higher fair... (SMH)
Then when you comment on it .... They want you out their cab & start talking rude to you!!! All I can say is UBER'S GOING MY WAY!!!!!! LBVS....< /text>< pics>

< Review>
I did not call company for pick up my tenant did   when they came to pick her up and her things . Right in front car 108 employee started to urinate in front of my house. I caught him with pants down stopped him and asked him what is thinking . He got embarrassed and said sorry this was all in front of the person he picked up. My tenant was embarrassed by this whole thing especially when there's a public bathroom to use on site. I had called left many messages to have manager call me back and no calls back and when I called to leave my many calls the dispatcher just said that he's busy.</Review>

<Review>Was at the er last night at 2 in the morn and waited for a taxi home, driver turned off radio because i was close to walk home from the hospital at 345 am, waited over hr and a half to finally have another one pick me up.  Ya it might have been a short ride but i was in the hospital and im not walking alone at 3 something in the morn cause the driver wants to be a duschbag.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80851440005aec41:0x5e21a9d56ba1d814</gmap_id>< user>

<review>Called for a cab and was told it would be 20-25 minutes wait time. 30 minutes went by and I called back and the dispatcher informed me that she had never sent a driver for me but that she would "get one right over". 20 minutes later a cab finally arrived.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Sunday evening October 9 2016 I called for a cab at 7:56pm was told 25-30 minutes and when 8:36pm came around and still no cab I started calling the number in which there was no answer, finally at almost 10:30pm someone finally answered, and I asked why the cab never showed up and was told that I was on some do not pick up list, now for the life of me I still cannot figure out why even after asking, then she said did you skip out on paying, I said never would I do that and asked who could I talk to about it and she gave me the main office number and I waited until Monday morning and called a few times with no answer again I left 2 voicemails then remembered it was a holiday so I waited to call today Tuesday October 11 2016 only to once again get the voicemail. I am very mad at the poor customer service this company has and will be making a report to the BBB.....

I rarely post comments, but this is the worst cab company ever.  I had booked a cab about one month ago and confirmed the pickup the day before to the airport.  Only about 1 hour before pickup, the company called me and said “We don’t pick up in Vacaville” and canceled my ride.< /text>

My daughter had a traumatic experience at another swim place close by and was terrified of any body of water. I brought her to Swim Labs and to Coach Josh for their adaptive swim lessons. She is nonverbal and autistic so learning new skills is hard. We are several lessons in and she loves the water again. Bath time just became WAY easier. Love this place?< /text>

<Review>We initially had a good experience but now that their business is picking up due to things opening the teachers keep on changing. One teacher in particular, Rich, is extremely pushy and assertive to the little ones. I’ve seen multiple kids cry and be pulled out of his class because of his behavior. My child is frustrated with the changing of teachers, which seems to be common and unannounced nowadays. Another downside is that there are 3 lap pools, so kids don’t get the full experience. There are simultaneous private and full classes in the same tiny pool which is very crowded for a tint space. It’s just not working out for us anymore and we will be looking at other options in the area.</Review>< pics>

My older girls love swim labs and the instructors to help with their stroke ability. Watching them on the monitors is very fun and helpful.  My 2 yr old did not like water other than the bath tub. Swim labs was very patient with him adjusting and we recently went on vacation to Maui and he was very comfortable in the pool and waded in the ocean with us! He loves his swim lessons now!  Everyone at swim labs is very personable and kind.<//text>

I cannot recommend swim labs enough! Our experience with the parent tot class for our 2 year old has been wonderful. We are currently on vacation in Maui and I credit our lessons at Swim Labs for our sons confidence and excitement in the water. Grateful for their instruction that is helping him work towards swimming and water safety. We love the facilities, so clean and new and the swim tanks are fabulous as they are warm, clean, and not overwhelming for a small child. Every staff member is helpful and welcoming.< /Review>

<Review>Friendly staff, clean facility and knowledgeable coaches!  The coaches and technology at SwimLabs are amazing. My son tried the team prep and liked it so much that he asked for more sessions. Having the visual to go with the coaches feedback/instructions really helped my son to understand what he needs to work on.  It is unique and helpful for him to watch himself swim and discuss his form/strokes with the coaches.  My son really enjoys it.  We’re impressed!< /Review><userid>100266545495389319145</userid><rate>5</rate></record>

<Text>The instructors are knowledgeable and their advice was great! Our son understood what he was told and made huge improvement in the short time he was in the water. Being able to see a split screen of of our son next to an Olympic swimmer was really cool. I love the entire idea of this business! We will definitely be back.</Text>< name>

< review>
My 3 yr old has been taking lessons with Josh for 1 month and half.  We have tried other swim schools but usually its a setting where multiple lessons are taking place in a large pool. Because my son is so easily distracted, swim lab is a great fit for him, since the pools are separated if there are other lessons taking place.

The instructor has done an excellent job building rapport with my son. He loves and enjoys coming to Swim Labs.

The place is super clean and my younger son has a clean place to hang out and play with toys while i observe my older son learning to swim from their large television screens.

I recommend this place for quality instruction and great place for learning.</review>

Very friendly & professional staff. Facility is clean & bright. Video swim session with Mikaela was very helpful in improving our daughter's stroke. Darin is our daughter's competitive swim coach and very passionate about swimming technique. Great experience! We highly recommend SwimLabs for any age and ability!<//Review>

This place has been great!!
I think many of the teachers are professional swim coaches and that affects the feel of the whole lesson!
Parent area is clean and nice and the glass you watch behind is very close to where kids swim which is nice.
They have a system where your kid advances through classes as skills grow and kids love it! So you come weekly and watch Thier skills grow!
Love it here
My kids are obsessed with this place!!< /Review>

The facility is very clean and tidy which is a plus.  All of the coaches are awesome.  They’re very knowledgeable, patient and give my son helpful feedback.  My son is 9 and swims on a year round competitive team.  Jaden has taken lessons here on different occasions.  He taken lessons to keep up his technique while he took a break during the winter months.  He also took a drop in lesson right before a swim meet to help with his butterfly stroke.  Overall, as long as he is happy to swim at Swimlabs we will always be a repeat client.</text>< rating>

< Review>
My son has been club swimming for 5 years.  He's hard to coach.  He thought he was doing things correctly.  I took him to swim labs one time for an hour with coach Darrin 10 days ago, today he dropped 27 seconds from his 200 free time, 8 seconds from his 200 free and FINALLY finished a 100 Fly without a DQ  at the Matt Casto Memorial meet.
The visual aspect of being able to see himself and finally understand what he needed to change was transformation.

And if the reply from SL looks odd, it's based on the first review from when my 9 year old elite swimmer went.  I was happy with that experience but today's experience is on a whole other level.  I can't recommend this experience highly enough.< /Review>

My son tried the lessons for a month and found the experience very helpful in correcting forms.  So we kept him going with lessons and our daughter decided to join in also.  I highly recommend Swim Labs for kids wanting to fine tune swimming techniques!< /Text>

My son has made great progress in learning freestyle in just a few weeks. His coach has done a great job helping him to focus and grow in his skills. The facility is awesome and the staff is all incredible. Blessed to be here!</review>

My 13 year old son is on a year round competitive swim team. He needed some extra help with his strokes so we decided to give Swimlabs in El Dorado Hills a try. The state of the art (spotlessly clean!) Facility is simply amazing. The high tech equipment is Olympic level and our instructors, Darin and Brian were top notch.The staff is also so friendly and welcoming. We are so happy with my son's results, time shaved off all his strokes and would highly recommend Swimlabs to any level of swimmer.</review>

Art & Science meet in the pool to help shape a swimmer's technique. Highly recommend to share with your swimmer because technique helps pave the way for improved speed!<//text>

A pandemic tragedy that they had to close the Pacific Ave. store in downtown Santa Cruz. So happy that the Capitola store is still open! They have fun classes here. Lots of great art supplies for kids and crafters. Books galore. Always the perfect place to find a gift. And also the classic supplies for your artist needs. Buy local and stop by the next time you are on 41st Ave.< /Review>

<review>I could spend all day in this store exploring. There is so much to discover and be inspired by. Great pen collection from gels to calligraphy to simple but beautiful ballpoints. Excellent selection of spray cans and tube paints. Extensive kids section for little creative minds. Super helpful non-invasive staff and enough things reasonably priced make this location a winning art supply store.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808e156b8e4ce36f:0xad4cbaf89049066a<//gmap_id></record>

Every yr. buy I ekonomic check register.   A necessary item at beginning of the yr.  palace always has.  This yr. no registers of any kind.  Clerk say we can special order.   Sez discontinued.  Go to Amazon,  every model is available.  The point being , in January, your buyer needs to be on top of this.</Text>

<text>PLEASE exercise caution when visiting, one of the team members tested positive for the coronavirus and the shop’s leads have done nothing to prevent another worker/customer from contaminating the public. At of the time of this post, no news has been sent out to the team, and there are no plans in place to decontaminate. STAY AWAY AND ORDER ANY AND ALL SUPPLIES ELSEWHERE IF POSSIBLE!

Edit as of Monday 12/21: The owners of the shop contacted the manager to keep the results under wraps. AVOID THIS SHOP LIKE THE PLAGUE, absolutely disgusting that they claim to be for the community.</text><Gmap_id>0x808e156b8e4ce36f:0xad4cbaf89049066a< /Gmap_id>< response>

<Review>Disorganized store with limited selection, and the staff don't have the resources needed to help inform customers.

I really want to support local businesses like this, and I sympathize with them being hit by the pandemic, but if they've got items on the shelves with no information and no price tags, how can they expect sales!?

Specifically, I'm talking about the framing supplies: they've got a ton of frames but the uncut mat boards all have no price information or details about the features on those particular boards, and they don't even have the equipment needed to do custom framing. They have like three mat cutters for sale but only a couple of the accessories and nothing for dust control or the common tools needed for taping.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Palace is a local go to place. It has stuff that you just can't find anywhere else. It has arts and crafts supplies, but much more. It also has unique children's toys and I can even get tax forms in the quantity I need there without having to buy 50 of them. I recently needed some foam core board and it was the only place locally that has it.</Review>< Pictures>

The store will racially profile you and follow you around the store by the way you look It don’t matter if you got money in your pocket but if you look suspicious they’ll follow you in store. And it’s every time I go.< /review>

I visited this location because I saw an art class advertised on their website that I wanted to sign up for. They didn't have a sign up sheet for the specific class I wanted and neither cashier or a supervisor knew anything about the class. I wanted to leave my phone number to be contacted with info another time, but, cashier just asked me to come in tomorrow and see if someone else knew about it... ooooohkay.
Other than that, I like the variety of things they have at Palace; I just wish the store was a bit more organized. I spend a lot of time wandering, and it's mainly because I can't find stuff! Staff is friendly enough, just wish there was a bit more information easily available.</review>

<Resp>None</Resp><user_name>Tessa Shabram</user_name><pics>None< /pics><text>Palace has a great selection of art supplies like the other reviews say, but today I had a terrible experience shopping there. I had a reusable shopping bag with me full of things I had just purchased at Urban Outfitters down the road for a friend's birthday present. As I was browsing the pens I was being uncomfortably hovered by three different employees. Then one of them comes up to me with a basket and asks me to please put my things that I would like to purchase in the basket instead of my reusable bag. I kindly explained to him that the items in my bag are not from here but a previous purchase. He says that he saw me reaching into my purse a lot on the camera and insists I use the basket, and I inform him that I was just checking my phone. I informed him that I did have a return in my bag with the receipt, and he made me give it to him then to hold on to until I was finished shopping. He quickly came back and kept hovering, asking if I wanted recommendations and I informed him that I was just browsing. He didn't leave and just awkwardly stood there hovering, and made me feel very uncomfortable. At that point I just wanted to get out of there because I felt wrongly accused of shop lifting so I went to buy my pen and make my returns. He passive aggressively asked me why I was making these returns so soon and why I didn't want them anymore. I proceeded to tell him the reason and he just cut me off rudely and asked for my credit card and ID. He called "customer service" up to the front and handed her my ID to make a copy in the back. He then asked me to fill out a form with my name and phone number. I asked him if this was normal for a return and he said yes. I have never been to a place that photo copies your ID for making a simple return with the receipt. I told him "It seems like you think I'm stealing, I'm not stealing anything and I feel really uncomfortable." and all he says is "I'm sorry you feel that way." They must have a thief problem at their store or something because I felt very violated and do not like that they have a copy of my ID. Passive aggressive, rude employees. Terrible experience, never going back there. I was just trying to do my part by using a reusable bag.< /text><date>1488343125973</date>< gmapID>

< Review>
A short while ago me and my 13yr old son walked in to Palace art's. My son's been saving his allowance for a couple month's so he can go in to Palace and be able to buy himself whatever he wants, he saved almost $100👍 As soon as we walked in the store 2 employees came around us trying to look busy but NEVER said hello or can "I help you?" Every time we moved or walked a little so did the employees.
No! We were not there to steal or cause any mayhem. We were there to shop.
My son felt scrutinized, so he walked out.
THANK YOU LOVELY EMPLOYEES👍👍👍 GREAT JOB!<//Review>

<Text>There’s an incredibly rude “manager” who works here who harassed my partner and I  for returning and exchanging brand new paints that I received for my birthday. When we went to choose new paints, he followed us and muttered incredibly rude things in response to us conversing about what colors I should get instead. It was such an uncomfortable experience I do not feel safe coming back to this location with such a disrespectful person managing the store.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><userid>110760149935931980974< /userid></record>

Great selection of paint and supplies, I drive about 45 minutes to an hour to get things here because I can't get them anywhere else and one is twice the price. Staff is friendly and the store is well kept.<//Text>

<review>A long-standing Santa Cruz institution - my go-to place for all things art & office for over 30 years! Palace really has a decent selection of basic art and office supplies with typically mid- to high-quality offerings at decent prices. Not as extensive in the art area as Lenz, and not as extensive in office supplies as the major big-box chain stores, but I think the buyers at Palace really do a good job in selecting products.< /review>< pics>

<text>They have a huge selection of art, school, and office supplies of all types, and are very friendly and helpful. If you look in the Good Times weekly you can usually find a $5 off coupon, or you can subscribe to their mailing list and get them that way. Cards, wrapping paper, umbrellas, household items, gifts, etc., you will just find all kinds of things here.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

< review>
I was just shopping at my favorite arts supply with my friend and we were looking at some nice squishy toys and pins. Then, this big ol gay guy with nice nails came up to us and assumed that we were going to steal, along with telling us "our backpacks should stay on our backs." We had no intention of stealing and he said that to us in a deadpan, rude voice which slightly offended me. He did not kindly talk to us. Additionally, we were looking at soft paintbrushes and gently playing with them. We do understand that that wasn't the best idea, but he told us not to in the same deadpan, rude voice, telling us "the cheap paintbrushes are over there, and we shouldn't be touching them." This made me feel like he thought we were poor, telling us that the paintbrushes were too expensive for us, probably based on our looks and age. I have had pleasant experiences in the past with this man, but definitely not today. I will take my artistic abilites elsewhere.</review>

Toaa was experienced and focused and I felt like I learned more about art during the session then I have going to any museum! The workshop was long enough to learn the basic techniques of oils and really experiment with painting. The depth of instruction really made it worthwhile and I was so happy with how my painting turned out! I not only learned how to paint something step-by-step but had the freedom to express myself and develop my own unique style. I was inspired to keep painting, which is what it's all about.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808e156b8e4ce36f:0xad4cbaf89049066a<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>They can be a bit pricey for things like notebooks and pens (better off going to target for that), but for art supplies paints, brushes and what have you, you're not going to beat their selections and their price is decent on that sort of stuff. They have some cliche touristy stuff at the front of the store, but I still like to look through that stuff.</Text>< Pictures>

Worst customer service I have ever encountered. The employees are rude and suspicious of anyone with a purse or bag. Management should train them on payment methods...most people carry their wallets in purses, pockets or bags. Totally unprofessional. Bypass this store.<//Text>

<review>ON the30th of Dec
I purchased  a small
Sketch book/ got the wrong one so I took it back to exchange for the one I should  have got in the first place.
Took too long and had to fill out a return from.
The thing is I was just exchanging  the article
for one of equal value.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

ONLY FOR WEBSITE
Their website is basically useless for looking for stuff
I looked up clay and it said 0 results, an art store should be able to tell you what they stock.<//Text>

Not a bad store but they don't carry very good craft wire. Most of the brands and items are geared toward students, not necessarily artists.<//Text>

My wife, son and I LOVE using Oak Valley Plaza Dental. The DR, hygienist and staff are all AMAZING. They are kind, courteous and extremely thorough with their work. They even send out a quick text message reminding us of our appointments. This family is extremely happy with their service and will continue to use them for years to come.< /Text>

I am very pleased with Dr. Zaw. His office is very efficient.  I phoned and was able to get an appointment the next afternoon. He saw me without delay, listened to my explanation of the problem,  and took immediate steps to resolve it. He is a great dentist.<//text>

By far the best dental experience I've had.  Walking in, the office was pristine.  There is a air of happy throughout.  You know when you walk into a business and their employees are happy, they are being taken care of and truly enjoy their jobs.  Everyone that I spoke to was kind and accommodating.  The dentist that worked on  me was gentle and thorough.  This office is great, if you are a little dentist shy this is the place to go.</Text>

< Review>
I had a dental emergency
Dr Saw's office contact me right away.
I was seen the same day.
The office is nice and clean
Everyone is very courteous and friendly.
Dr. Saw was very proffesional and friendly
I usually get very nervous when i go to the dentist but everyone from reception to his assisstants and especially Dr. Saw made feel comfortable.
Excellent service in my opinion.<//Review>

Professional, clean, and taking covid precautions seriously. Always a good experience here, which is hard considering it’s the dentist. If you’re looking for a dentist in the area, this is the one to try.</review>

Oak Valley Plaza Dental has been our team for about eight years now. They are awesome!! The hygienists are all fantastic, friendly, clean and organized. Dr. Zaw never tries to "upsell," but gives good, practical advice and referrals. Our son has special needs and was terrified at first to even open his mouth. Thanks to terrific, sweet and patient hygienists he now gets through a whole appointment, x-rays, cleaning and all. Great office!</review>

Yesterday was the first time I had been to OVPD. Needless to say, I’ll be a patient there for quite some time. Very clean, very professional and very friendly. The hygienists and dentists are very informative and knowledgeable. I mistakenly gave them the wrong insurance and called back today to give them the proper insurance and without hesitation they took care of everything. Including reimbursing me for what I paid initially. Definitely recommend this establishment for anyone looking for a permanent “home” for their dental hygiene.< /Text>

Always a pleasant experience with their courteous, proficient & professional care & attention to patient needs, queries & concerns.  They provide estimates of insurance vs out-of- pocket costs upon request prior to performing the needed procedures  - a plus to ensure options & decisions are well thought & carried out.</Review>

All I want is a cleaning, checkup and let me know if there's a problem.  Well I lucked out when I found Oak Valley Plaza Dental. Dr. Zaw is great and to the point and I can't say enough about his GREAT support staff their amazing! Look no future.

<Review>I’ve been going here for many years as well as my daughters and my husband too and it’s always a great experience. The staff is extremely caring, from the moment I walk in the door, all the way to the wonderful lady that cleans my teeth. She is so friendly and understanding and personable!!! The dental assistants are friendly and professional. Dr. Zaw (dentist) is friendly and professional, explains things as he goes etc... I have very sensitive teeth and they are always willing to numb me again and never make me feel bad for asking for it!!! I can go on forever about how wonderful they are lol but I’ll stop at they are AMAZING in every way😊<//Review><Name>Carol Snyder</Name><Rating>5<//Rating>< response>

Kelly is wonderful. Careful, steady care for me.  Lots of years of going to the dentist, but I now have the best mouth care ever.</Review>

Oak Valley Plaza Dental is a great place to go, especially if you have ever been embarrassed about your teeth.  They made me feel comfortable and did not make me feel bad about the work I needed.  The staff are awesome and it is very easy to get a appointment right away.</text>

I hadn’t been to the dentist in a long time. They make me nervous because of an emergency dental procedure I needed years ago. So my daughter goes to Oak Valley Dental and pushed me to go. I finally did and they were very kind and patient. I told them I had anxiety about being there so they told me to tell them at any time and they’d stop and give me a moment. My exam and cleaning was done by Michelle. She’s a kind sweetheart. Her kindness and concern for my wellbeing and fear was very reassuring and put me at ease. I need a little more work done and she and the Dr put me at ease for what we need to have done. The whole staff from the front desk, to the hygienists and doctor were great! I’m glad I went</text>

< Review>
I have had a fear of dental work my whole life. This dentist and staff went above and beyond to make me comfortable. I would have been sedated just for cleaning and with Dr. Zaw, I have been thru a crown and root canal with NO medication at all. I've been a patient for years now as well as all my family and coworkers. I highly recommend!</Review>

Dr. Zaw has done several crowns for me.  It's Important to have a nice smile! I am no longer shy to smile and I am so grateful that I can smile naturally.  Oak Valley Plaza Dental has changed my life and increased my confidence.  I love getting compliments on my smile now.  Dr. Zaw and staff made my dental experience painless and comfortable.  I will continue to use this dental practice and all it has to provide.</text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I really enjoyed my checkup and cleaning with Dr Zaw and staff. I come here on my way to the outlets for my cleanings . It's very conveniently located off the freeway. The staff are friendly and sweet . I loved that I could have a cup of keurig coffee before my cleaning . I took  a bottle to go after . These little classy touches make me happy to know that dr Zaw and staff think about the comfort of their patients. I highly recommend him and that's why I drive all the way from Orange County to see him twice a year . Great patient care .< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

It is a very small Middle Eastern market, but pretty good stocked with merchandisers. Employees are freindly and helpful. Prices are average to good.< /Text>

The Persian style bread they bake there it the best I have had anywhere! I usually get plain thick white and plain thin white, but they have other options. The family who runs this place are great, especially the mom...she is very helpful and sweet :) Highly recommended!!!!

P.S. I'm sorry I don't have better pictures...it's probably because I'm too exited about eating the bread to think about taking pictures! Haha!</review>< pics>

They make their own bread, offer limited produce, spices, frozen foods, yogurt with garlic, pickles, condiments, sweets, nuts & seeds, cheeses,  etc

I would definitely recommend this store.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

New owners
Very friendly , great service
Though I've been going there for many many many years
Will miss the kind gentleman. I wish them only the best , they worked very hard
The bread tasted a bit different , the dolmas in a can had different labels, I'll have to keep trying new things. I wish the new owners the best.< /Review>

I live in Livermore and was passing through Concord and I decided to stop here to check it out for later times. The store is not huge but they have almost everything you need and maybe even more. The gentleman behind the counter and the ladies were all super friendly and really helpful. I ended up buying some cold cuts and the gentleman even gave me plastic containers to store the meat in. I highly recommend this place and I will definitely shop here again.< /text>

Overpriced. People are nice. But I couldn't believe my eyes everything was %10-15 more expensive than other Iranian markets in town despite the fact that their location is the cheapest. The only unique thing is that they bake bread. So, great if you look for freshly baked flat bread.< /Text>

Great selection and very friendly staff. They have several types of sangak...Delicious! Their prices are a bit high compared to markets I've shopped at in LA, but I guess that's to be expected since in this area they are basically a specialty shop.</review>

The staff was pleasant, but I got there at shift change and had to wait about 10 minutes. No big deal. The only downer was there is no place for dogs to potty. There is a park several blocks East.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Places is crazy loud. I guess the owners dont care who hangs out inside their parking lot. If you're expecting to get good night rest I don't recommend this place. No ice. Hot tub was broken. I changed rooms but was charged the same.</Review>

Surprisingly well maintained and updated. Clean and well-maintained the grounds are landscape well and the rooms are clean and nicely done. I travel from time to time and I am flagging this to come back to. Out of the hotels that I've stayed at this year this will be the only one that I will come back to.</review>

I like this very much even tho it's very active 24/7 and a whole lot goes on here but everyone seems to mind their own. Staff is always kind and meeting to your needs. They are always willing n trying to meet your needs. I am very comfortable. They could kinda make the rooms be nore cozy and welcoming tho.< /review>

Okay let me start off by saying I’ve never really been in this area but it was not what I expected at all, the location was horrible. There were a bunch of lady of the nights who stayed in the hotel I was staying in, there was also drug dealings going on. It was a mess. The room itself stunk of cigarettes and then when I washed my hands the water wasn’t going away and when I look a roach of a blunt came up to the surface. It was just not a good experience such a sketchy place. The other thing is I don’t understand why they’re charging 100$ a night in a place where you feel unsafe<//review>

Staff was friendly and rooms are nice especially for that part of town and compared to other rooms in same area.

Overall, no complaints...nice room, good service, good company... I will definitely book here next time I need a room in this area.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>I debated giving 2 stars or 3 stars for several reasons. There was a lot of activity at the motel.  Couldn't tell if they were guests or just coming in off the street. The saving grace was that the room was clean and neat and it did contain everything I needed, ample towels, wash clothes etc.  Go for the price which is rarely beaten but plan on putting up with a cast of characters roaming the grounds/parking lot.< /text>< gmapID>

HORRENDOUS

I stayed in the room for maybe 4 hours. I cut my overnight stay short as the bed had cigarette burns in the sheets, graffiti on the wall and oh yea, roaches in the room. As I began to eat my dinner I noticed a HUGE roach crawling along the wall. After closing up my food, protecting it from contamination/infestation, I noticed several smaller ones on the floor. At that point, I decided that this es not the place to stay. I went to tell the front desk who said they could not do anything to refund my money. I showed him the video and pictures capturing the infestation. He said talk to the manager.

I left at that point.

During my stay, the security of the property is poorly maintained. I witnessed several potential drug addicts, transients and what appeared to be non patrons doing as they pleased in the parking lot.< /text>

ROACHES, yes people don’t leave your bags and clothes laying around. It was clean and people in the service desk window was friendly. But this owner really needs to look into this problem, and reconsider the high pricing for this hotel. The prices are higher in the weekend bc people show up with their hookers to check out a room. So This is definitely NOT a family friendly motel.< /review>

The motel is located in a rough neighborhood with lots of street workers and constant questionable activity everywhere, but the motel itself is nice because it was remodeled 3 months ago.  The room interiors are all freshly painted with new floors, fixtures, etc.  Probably the cleanest motel in the vicinity.< /review>

Room smelled, sheets and comforter stained. No support on the bed for back or neck.  Pillows were flat!   The staff were pleasant is the only good thing I can say about the place.  Neighborhood was not the worse I have been in but it was run down and you could tell a dilapidated neighborhood.<//Text>

< review>
This is a no frills hotel with bullet proof glass between you and the front desk clerk. The room was clean, though it wreaked of cigarettes despite being a no smoking room. The hotel's location is in a neighborhood where being aware of your surroundings is a must. Don't expect an amazing resort experience - just a clean, spartan room in an older property. It's exactly what you are paying for.<//review>

Terrible experience. From the bad customer service- down to the hairs in the towels. I've stayed at many Motel 6 hotels.

This location is by far the worst experience I've had w/ Motel 6! Super disappointed..<//text>< pictures>

The rooms were very nice and spacious with plenty of lighting for reading, doing puzzles,etc...
Exterior, also had plenty of lighting for security reasons.
The balcony was cleaned frequently.
No swimming pool.
Access onto the property needs to be addressed so that patrons can enter and exit without incident.
Otherwise, excellent place in an undesirable neighborhood.< /Text>

So when I turned on the heater all of the heat escaped out of the room from underneath the door.

<Review>At my arrival, the desk clerk was not in the office. Juan came in and tried to take of guests. He didn't seem to know what was going on. (Very bad) When I was checking in, the card reader wasn't working. I had to go to a bank and get cash. (Very bad) Nothing  good to say about this motel.

The cost of the one bedroom was around $70 which was great. Everything look amazing 😍. I wanted to live there. The pressure of the shower was hard but not too hard. The water temp stayed consistent. THE BED!!! 😍😍😍 It was soft and it big. It came with 4 PILLOWS!!! We ended getting the smoking room sadly because the others where all booked. But even then the smell of cigarettes wasn't that strong. There was cable, a mini fridge (with nothing in it), and an easy to use AC.</text>

I would recommend spend an extra $20.00 get a better place. Lacking of basics, like no irons. No hair dryer. No coffee maker. No shampoo only a small bar of soap. Bed was ok but sheets had hairs on it.<//Text>< Rating>

< Review>
The room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. We slept well. The only unsatisfactory part was my room not having a microwave as it was suppose to, and when I asked for a room with a microwave or one to be brought into room, I was told by employee at front desk no to both fixes to get microwave. Unfortunately, the food I had purchased went to waste. as they required multiple steps of microwaving per the recipe. So, I asked for the front desk once again to compromise and accommodate a late check out as compensation and was told no again.</Review>

<text>Our room was infested with bees. There were bees all over the floor, on the walls, in the bathroom - everywhere we looked we found dead and living insects. The front desk staff informed us that they would "look into it" and offered no form of compensation or reimbursement. One member of our group was allergic and getting stung could have resulted in a trip to the hospital. I will never stay at a Motel 6 again and would recommend that nobody ever stay in this disgusting hotel.</text>< Pics>

The great plus was there were NO signs of bedbugs!!!</Text><Rating>5</Rating>< pics>

Room had roaches, and when I came in the morning before work to extend my stay with a reservation the worker said I could not pay for the room with cash for 2 hrs. That caused me to have to check out by 11 am and I had to go to work. My work break is at noon, 20 miles away. this all started at 7:15 am. So my dogs are in the room I arrive 12:20 or so and try to pay to extend my stay. I cannot said the worker in office. Although I had a reservation. Because I was late on the check out. They already had contacted animal control too. So the management sucks there and I would not return.. I do like the San Bernardino south location. But downtown sucks.,< /text>

The walls were paper thin, could hear EVERYTHING! From the person in the next room conversation, someone knocking a few doors away, etc. There was a few late night "business women" walking in the parking lot. I wouldnt have paid what I did just for 1 night. I could have spent 10.00 more and went to a 5☆, but I had no choice since the last hotel was not family friendly.</review>< name>

<Text>For a motel 6 and for just needing a place to sleep this place is not bad. Room was fairly clean, hardwood floors and looked decent enough. There wasn't any shampoo in the room. Parking was free for all, so be aware if you're back late it might be tough to get parking especially after an event. Anyway, recommend for just a bed. Real close to NOS center.<//Text>< pictures>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>As of July 2017, this is a pretty new Motel 6; at least, the interior is new.

It was nice not to have ash trays in the room, finally! There was a very slight tobacco odor, though. It was not bad, but there were two cigarette burns on the tub. Some people just don't obey the rules!

Many of the bright-white towels had some type of mark on them. I suppose it is really hard to get stains out of white towels. They were grey and another had bright red fingernail polish on it.

The pool was not finished; but, I suppose it will be, soon.

There is a security guard during the day; but, they really need one at night to keep the locals from roaming through the parking lot. One guy was collecting cans at 4:30 in the morning. I do not begrudge him his living, but I don't like having to watch my car at that time. (I wish the motel had a recycling bin, too.)

On the plus side, I do like the new recessed lighting; it's very nice and contemporary!

The front desk people were very nice, letting us check in early. Thank you!< /Text>< Pics>

They try harder. In a run-down neighborhood, this is a safe haven with fully fenced parking, spotless, spacious, fresh smelling room, with frig & microwave. Grounds cleaned daily. A cut above the usual Motel 6 experience in southern California.</Review>

Honestly it was comfortable stay , I’ve stayed here multiple times and it has been a great experience for me . Nice rooms with a mini fridge in the room  wooden floors and flat screen TVs , the bed was comfortable and the room was very clean , the front desk guy (Luis) is very friendly and very professional, they have free coffee in the morning and also have a microwave in the lobby . Overall stay 10/10<//Review>

We stayed here on our trip toward Vegas, it was late at night and we needed to find something fast. It was very sketchy, people walking all around the motel, I didn't feel safe leaving anything in my car. The staff was nice, The room was clean and my daughter liked the little folding design they did with the towels on the bathroom tub.<//review>

Motel 6 clearly isn't a ritzy or elegant place to stay but it's affordable, clean and i've never seen a bug or had bites from them! Which I did get staying at a high end luxury hotel in the Los Angeles area!< /Text>

If you're on a budget or trying to ball on a budget(going VIP to your event) I'd say stay here. The rooms are clean, the staff are friendly and it was only 7 min away from the nos center. This is my go to motel whenever I'm going to a rave around the area. Pretty quite neighborhood and it's next to a greyhound and also in & out.</Review>

Super clean, and spacious. Sink was outside of bathroom (toilet and tub/shower), which I didnt mind. We picked a non smoking room, and as soon as we entered room was really stuffy and had faint smells of smoke. Could have been due to the room next door, since that one was not non smoking. Rooms have thin walls, and you can hear showers running from upstairs rooms, as well as medium loud noises from next door rooms. All in all, I would definitely stay here again as room was cheap, clean, and in a good location<//text>

The room itself was pretty decent but the area that it's in is more than a little shady. We stayed here to go to a show at the Glen Helen Pavilion and outside our window we saw multiple prostitutes and a number of drug deals. The hotel served it's purpose but I don't think I'll be staying here again.< /Text>

Neg.-The bedspread had burns and housekeeping could clean better because hair was left in the bathroom. The room needed to be aired out but I had Fabreeze.The housekeeping needs to be more respectful when dealing with the public.< /Review>< user_name>

The room was clean and the beds were nice. Only real complaint i have is the remote was ether dead or broken and we couldn't get the front desk to answer the phone or door. The pool is drained it's the middle of summer they should have that fixed. The area around the motel isn't the best. If you stay there at night stay inside or drive your car don't walk around.</Review>

The house keeping were a bit rude and we're on their phone and told me to wait after asking me if I needed anything.  The bedding were stained and pillows still had some guests hair on it .  There's no late check out  and there are homeless people that knock on your room door to ask for money or to sell you random things.. only good experience was meeting my friend . Hopefully motel 6 can correct some of these problems  now that they took over the building . I been to some great motel 6 and always recommend them but until then this hotel I will wait a while before coming back< /text>< Pics>

This stay has been one of the best at motel 6. I've stayed at all 3 of the locations here in San Bernardino. This one (San Bernardino downtown) being the best: front desk being amazing great house keeping. And very well kept modern rooms.< /Text>

Just a room with a shower and bed. Didn't even provide shampoo. Someone had a dog going crazy at night in another room. There were homeless people sitting on the ground right in front of the front office. Loud music could be heard around 2am, and then someone was screaming bloody murder at about 4am. You can find much better for $78.<//Review>

<Text>We stayed at this location because it was close to the Glen Helen Amphitheater where we were attending Hard Summer. Not going to lie it felt pretty ghetto when we first pulled up there were a lot of bums out front wanting money my girlfriend was even offered crack for the WiFi password. We got to the room and I was actually impressed it was nice inside just the cigarette smell was pretty bad. The security guard was also nice made sure that we were taken care of all and all it wasn't a bad trip.<//Text>< Pics>

This place is awful! Construction started at 6am when I went to the front desk to speak with a manager a gentleman started arguing with me! I would never stay here again! Very rude and unprofessional! Bad customer service perhaps you may benefit from some staff training..<//Text>

Refrigerator doesn't work and they don't have a microwave. When I stayed here last month these things weren't a problem. The guy in the front keeps promising to bring in a new fridge but hasn't after about 4 says. I'm leaving today. My food went bad btw. And the house keepers keep walking in on me and my kids without knocking first and they're very rude!< /text>

Staff was nice and the room was ok. Terrible neighborhood, there was quite a bit of unwelcoming activity going on in the lot and rooms. Not worth $120 for one night at all. Pretty much didn't feel safe leaving the room.</Text>

The room was basically clean when we arrived but as the weekend went on we noticed various things that were not up to what I feel are Motel 6 standards. The staff although were friendly and took care our needs when we asked.< /review>

Upon arrival the entire front part of motel smelled like weed.  The neighborhood is very ghetto but the motel does have security - at least cars were safe.  The staff was very helpful. It was a very hot day and no water in the pool.  The restroom had mildew on ceiling.  However, the room was very modern and clean.  So for a 1 night stay it served it purpose.</Review>< Pics>

Had to stay there for a couple of weeks with my family when we were having an issue with our house because it was the most livable affordable motel in SB. The rooms are very nice. I believe they were recently renovated. They have a fridge and microwave. Lots of storage space. The managers always helped with whatever you needed. I would rate 5 if it wasn't for the location its in. There's always homeless people trying to sell you something that's complete junk or trying to squat in the walkway or on the steps. The gas station across the street is obviously a drug deal spot. They make it known clear as day. Always a lot of commotion outside at night.</review>

Handicapped room: No seat in the shower, shower handrails not secure, no soap shelf, no handheld sprayer.
Toilet: no paper roll on wall -- paper sitting on back of toilet.
Room: no place to hang clothes; feet turned black from walking on hard floor; TV buzzing, missing channels, no channel list, nothing standard.
Other: Bulletproof glass in lobby made me feel like it was in a war zone; staff dressed sloppy & slow to perform check in; pool drained empty.
This is a FRANCHISE, not a corporate property. It is SO bad it doesn't deserve to have the M6 brand on it.</Review>

The room was clean, but the pool was out of service. The location of this hotel is in a bad part of town. Lots of homeless and sketchy looking people. Would have given less stars but i Gave 3 stars because the room was very clean. Only thing was that bothered me about the room is that you could tell that it had been smoked in. You can tell they tried to get the smell out but it still had a slight smoky smell. overall my experience was ok. The room was great but the rest of the facility and the area is very run down.< /review>

When the hotel clerk is behind safety glass you have to wonder how safe are you?!!!  The pool was empty, no landscaping, no parking for registering, and interesting neighborhood.  I had a reservation or I would have kept driving.  When the WiFi did not stay connected I was told to open my door and stand there.  What???  Ah, no.

The room was very large with a large king size bed.  It looked new and clean inside.  Who ever cleans the room did a nice job and even folded the towels in an ornate way to add extra charm.

Even though this place tells you to park in the marked handicap spaces while registering for your room, don't do it.  If you get caught parking there with out a handicap placard you can get fined $250.

Interesting experience.  Sooo glad I had a dog.<//text>

I had called in advance for early checkin of 2pm, had reservations for a no smoking bedroom with refrigerator for about $75.00 a night. I was approved the early check in. Upon arrival at 3pm I was told my $$ was incorrect and they tried to up my nightly rate to $150 a night and told me no refrigerator was available, I argued as I had a reservation, I called customer care line waited for 20 minutes prior to hanging up, with no help. Finally got in room and refrigerator was provided but rusted, TV didnt work and room was not up to my living standards, as a new hotel how can it be in this much disarray.
I contacted Rudy at the front desk but nothing was done, it was uncomfortable to see prostitutes in the area and the hotel cleanliness this way. What honest hotel tries to double the price upon arrival?? We were there for a weekend getaway that turned out not to be to pleasant and very disappointing to the MOTEL 6 brand, again no answer when calling the customer service line and no assistance from local staff to fix TV, rusted refrigerator or cleanliness of the room.< /text>

Hi the hotel is brand new and still under construction. The lobby isn't finished and guests are not allowed to enter the construction site so it was a little confusing at check in.

I had reserved a non-smoking room and when I arrived in my room there were ash trays everywhere. I was exhausted and didn't have the energy to figure out the lobby, and pack up and move all of my things.

Additionally, when I attempter to call the front dest the phone in my room was not working.</Review>

<review>This is going to be long and I apologize. If you only plan to spend two or three nights then this is a good place for you. If you are looking for a homey kind of room and planning for a longer stay you might need to look elsewhere. But please keep in mind this is a budget motel. Even with the negatives I would give this location three and a half stars.

My wife and I had to rent a motel room for several days while waiting for our new residence to be ready.
We chose Motel Six because it was pet friendly for our little dog. This Motel Six is not in the best area, with working girls around and doing what working girls do. However within the motel area we did feel secure. The room we stayed in was a very large corner room, over 200 square feet. The rooms have been recently remodeled and now they don't exactly shout "Welcome." Hospital sterile is not a good look, seriously.

The only things that break up the monotonous  walls are the window, an air conditioner, and a nice sized flat screen TV. There were no wall mounted lamps next to the large king size bed, not even the mandatory tacky artwork on the walls. The ceiling lighting is in keeping with the room design, recessed, white, and sterile, as if the designers didn't know they make flourescent light bulbs that duplicate the warm welcome feeling of the incandescent ones. In fact I even brought one of my own lamps from home.

The clothes hanging rack is miniscule, just two small posts protruding from the wall with not enough room between them to allow the hangers not to overlap each other. If you have more than eight items of clothing to hang I am afraid you are out of luck. Below that are three small shelves, the only places in this very large room to put folding clothes. Both of these will be an issue for any guy who has a wife or a girlfriend.

This leads to the lack of surfaces. There is a half table mounted to the wall along with two Spartan Ikea type chairs. The bathroom sink area didn't need to have such a small surface area, as to one side there was a fifteen inch empty space between it and the adjacent wall. Again remember the wives and girlfriends. There is no dresser or chest of drawers as is found in most motel rooms to store your clothes, thus there is no top surface on which to set anything either. In summary it is as if Motel 6 did the remodel on the cheap with no thought toward the convenience and comfort of its customers, especially leaving out wives and girlfriends.

That is too bad, since the staff there is great. I had no problems with the rudeness of the housekeeping staff of which other reviewers have mentioned. And if I did I wouldn't hold it against them. They are working at a hard minimum wage job, often with no tips for their good service. And the office staff are all very nice people, always willing to help with a friendly smile and that is a huge plus for travelers. I just wish that in this case at least Motel Six was on par with its employees.
PS: On the plus side Motel Six provides in room mini refrigerators. 😁😁😁< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>Absolute worst motel 6 I have ever stayed at. There were towels that had dirt on them still. The floor had drops of blood and it’s ridiculous how there is no non smoking rooms. My asthma flared up because of the absolutely obnoxious amount of smoke smell that was lingering in the room. Also the beds blanket had cigarette holes and it was an off putting brown color. In a lot of way health inspection or some county body should be called on this motel. It was absolutely disgusting. Also the service was rude and even asking a simple question the front desk gave short demeaning answers.<//Text></record>

This has been, by far, the worst motel experience we have ever had. The other guests would blast their music from their cars until 4 am and the management never said one word to them. They just shrugged their shoulders. It is worth the extra money to stay somewhere else. We will never stay here again.< /Text>

<review>Things my friends and I saw in my 8 hours at this motel:
-Some guy just staring at us intensely as we pulled in from the second floor
- 2 separate groups of tweakers going into 2 separate rooms for about 10 mins to get drugs
- A (probably) prostitute across the street going from car to car just trying her luck
- A guard goose outside someone's house
- A security guard at the nearby In N Out asking a man to leave who was being loud and then just giving up on that when the man refused to leave
Room was mostly clean except for the graffiti on the mirror which they at least attempted to remove. Most of this is San Bernadino's fault, not Motel 6's.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I would give this extra five stars because the room was clean, fresh paint, new bed, nice mini refrigerator, the floor was mop. Check-in 3:30pm Check-out 11:00am free WiFi. The front desk person wasn't friendly.</Review>

Hotel is located in a bad neighborhood lots of homeless and prostitutes roaming around property at night. Their were people playing loud muisic in the rooms and smoking marijuna. My non smoking room smelled of smoke and had ashtrays in it. The bedding was not clean their were hairs and other debris in the sheets and lipstick on pillowcase.</Text>

Place to stay that's it, people outside all night, prostitution all around the hotel but the staff didn't really care, probably making money off of it too.

< Review>
Very rude racist owners, they theated to run over our familys dog if they seen it outside our room. Me my kids and my husband had a two bed room and they would only give us one room key, they would always jump outside to watch us anytime we walked outside the room. This motel is in a very run down part of San Bernadino and there is a handful of bad things happening in the streets, we are from Ontario and we didn't come to cause trouble but they treated us like inmates and made anything easy difficult. Do not get a room there.</Review>

been here before and the managers/service people are on it! even the polite lot attendant guy was nice enough to direct me on parking because im a newer driver and struggle to back into spots. there was a deveoping mold spot in th bathroom but im assuming they working on it since it was patched recently. clean, smells nice, and feels safe (although sometimes there are strange fellows across the street, they never bother the motel!) and definitely will reccomend, and go again!</Review>

Frig didnt work tv channel sucked and no pool 😢 kept getting up didnt feel to safe here , staff friendly room ok but towel rack was broken and mold over shower head but bed was very comfortable ,  facility guy was in fixing towel rack and left plaster all over the floor and counter I just walked into the room and he didnt even ask if it was my room major red flag . Even for the price I would of choose another place . It would of been better if the pool was up and running .</review>

Room was dirty,  had to ask for a cleaning which they did so badly  the dirt around the doors,  beds,  & on the night stand as well as the top of the AC had to be pointed out for cleaning.
- not to mention the roaches.

Not only was this property in poor condition, but the neighborhood was not safe.  Employeees were asleep behind the glass barriers.  This was the worst place I have ever stayed in.  We rented two rooms and one room only had one light working - the other room the bathroom light was broken.  No-one answered our calls to fix it to the front office.<//Review>

<text>First off the area is very sketchy. Lot of people hanging around. The receptionist are like in some panic room type office behind bullet proof glass.I thought I was at a bank for a moment. Lots of people looking out their windows like if they are waiting for something, or someone. The rooms are ok , but I did get some bug bites. I have sensitive skin so they appeared shortly after I laid in bed. Half used roll of toilet paper upon arrival. Let's just say this isn't one of their better kept locations.</text>< user_id>

There was very obvious dirt all over my bed sheets and drool stains all over the pillows. The water from the sink comes out white and chalky, I honestly can't even give this disgusting place a star for their customer service. Everything about this motel is disgusting< /Review><rate>1< /rate></record></dataset><record>

I called ahead and was told a price less than $100 and when I got there the lady at the window was extremely rude and when I asked the price she charged $40 above the original quote. The area is sketchy. And the staff seems angry. Stay elsewhere.< /Text>

Everything was OK
The only 2 things I will say is the location of the place I stayed at was in the hood of San Bernardino (no fault to owner) but there was no free coffee in the morning.<//text>

The mini fridge wasn't plugged in. The phone line wasn't fully seated in the phone jack; I had to push on it to make a call. I had lint and hair on the back of my shirt after sleeping on the bed.< /Text>
