I went with family for the first time ever around the holidays, and everyone loved their dish, including the kids (they have kids menu). It's a nice place, it felt and looked clean, with beautiful decor, enough outdoor seating. The service was great and so was the food. After lunch we had some good coffee and they served it in the cutest mugs. I will be definitely coming back and try more dishes!</text>

We had three different people trying to help and we still got forgotten. 45 min wait for food and not crowded at all. Maybe some confusion. No big deal. The mucho mango margarita was so good. The regular margarita was perfect but we got it to go because someone forgot about us. No real apology. Sad because the chefs and bartender were great< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Best Mexican food in Modesto. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars  is because  almost every time I go there and get an order to go., When I get home  something is missing. I usually order a lot of food to take out  and its  pretty hard to take everything out of the bag and check it.  I guess ill have to start doing that tho. Got home last week and my refried beans wasn't in the bag.  tonight   i asked for extra salsa   got home   No extra salsa  But they gave me extra jalapenos.  Nice people tho. Very friendly service. They just seem to keep forgetting what I ordered.<//text>

I was pleasantly surprised with my visit here. The outdoor dining is very inviting not just a tent in a parking lot. Now to the food everything had such a great quality and attention to detail. Their corn tortillas are made in house! If you are lucky enough to go on the weekend their Birria is 🔥! I'm definitely going to be back soon!<//Text>

<text>They overcharged for 49 dollars and I tipped. I called back to talk to a manager and I got the waitress. She explained that because I don't have a receipt they can't look up my information. This is a lie. You have to keep records for tax purposes. She said she would give me the owner's number. She waited 3 minutes and said she couldn't find it. Then 5 minutes later she told me she can't give out the owner's number. She told me to come down and show my receipts. How can I show receipts for something I didn't purchase? They charged my card without me knowing and refuse to give it back.  The waitress told me you can come down here and see the owner but he is never here. Save your receipts because this place will rip you off.</text><user_id>105888878628621372251</user_id>< Name>

The service was ok, we had steak fajitas for 2, price on menu was $26 we were charged $29 told was because of higher meat prices.  No effort to let us know ahead of time.  The vegies were cooked to perfection, the steak was a little tuff.  The fly population was a little out of hand but we expected some not quite so many.  An A+ for making the place look nice.< /Text>

< Review>
This is not an order-at-the-counter taqueria - it’s a beautifully decorated, served-by-a-waitress, family-owned newly-opened gem featuring unique Mexican food from a specific area of that country. The Enchiladas Mexicanas that the wonderful server recommended was unique and one of the most delicious meals I’ve ever had - from any restaurant. What a pleasant surprise - highly recommended.</Review>

Overall our experience was great! As soon as we walked in I noticed the beautiful art on every wall. I ordered Camarones A La Diabla and my boyfriend ordered Chilaquiles, They were Delicious! We will be back for more 😌</review>

<review>Went in first day and 3 days later it was ok  ...
You need to put plastic banner out front every morning.
Breakfast burritos
Chorizo egg
Bacon egg
Veggie burrito
For like around 6.75
with all the medical offices around you would do good .
Then put regular restaurant sign at lunch time.</review>< pics>

<Review>I had the fish and chips it was excellent the fish was cod and it was very flaky and tasty. I also love the steak fries. Our server was very nice. It was our first time out in a Restaurant in a year. They social distance and wear masks. We felt very safe eating here.</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Me and my buddy came here for a beer while in town.
Waitresses passed by us and never took our drinks for 20 minutes. Then we moved to the bar, and sat down.  2 girls sat down at a table and they went to serve them instead so at this point we bounced.
If this is a business you treat new customers nicely, I got the "locals only" vibe. And that is motorcycle riders it seems.</text>< Pics>

Excellent!  Met up with my Employer and he bought me two beers.  Talked about a possible raise in the near future, but thanks to the epidemic that's not going to happen anytime soon, but it felt good being back to work again, and being outside, and the 55 Yard line has great service!</Text>

The last time we were there there was a weird albeit decent singer (my wife is much better)  was doing karaoke but coming up to each table.  I was like am I supposed to tip her?  How do I get her to go away.  Other then that...perfect night.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Probably deserves 3.5 stars.  Old school sports bar.  We had hot dogs, fries and tater tots, and all were very good. Staff was friendly and attentive - although they forgot to put in our order so it took close to an hour. But they were very apologetic and they gave us complimentary tots.  Between the music and TVs, very loud - it is, after all, a sports bar. They have a couple of pool tables and arcade games.  Not sure it's ideal for watching a game you're really into - more for casual viewing.  I was surprised at how limited the beer selection was though.  Overall, pretty decent place, nice staff, good enough food.< /Text>

Ask servers for specials before ordering "happy hour" deals.  These DO NOT start at 4pm. Bartenders were also confused when I showed this list when asking about a higher than expected bill.< /text>

Definitely nice little place to be for someone's birthday. My boyfriend was invited for his birthday. The place was packed. There was security but even then it was way too many people. The bathrooms were a disaster. They were tiny and uncomfortable to sit in. 2 toilets for the many drunken women.

Well, I'll ba going back. They have pool tables. Sold!< /review>

< Review>
This place allows it's employees to get trashed and harass customers. Not only was the employee completely wasted, but he was in a fist fight with another customer out front and they band the customer who was only defending themselves! Then this drunken employee proceeded to put his hands on me after screaming in my face and spitting on me! All because I had my skateboard. Completely inappropriate behavior! This is not the first time this employee has done this either. I was told by several SCARED coworkers that he puts his hands on customers and woman all the time but they can't say anything because he's higher up. This place is white trash! Maybe their employees should drink less and do their job. Sad that the cops had to be called because he couldn't keep his hands to himself.<//Review>

Went there just trying to find good chill places to eat and watch football.  Walked in and the atmosphere and people were amazing.  The staff was courteous and really attentive bringing drinks and food as quickly as possible, and the food was delicious.  I can easily see myself becoming a regular there for the time I'm in San Marcos.  Great place!!!< /text>

Sucks.  I got 3 beers on happy hour.  Supposed to only be 12 bucks but then I looked at my bank statement and they charged me 2 times for 10 dollars.  My first time going with my sister and brother in law sucked worse.  No service.  Seems like a whites only atmosphere.  I've only came here 3 times and every time I do It sucks.  The lady bar tender was nice and that was the only person who was.  But then again I was over charged.  Over all place seems shady and service is bad.  But If you a older white male this is the place to be<//review>

Good place to have a drink. However, I believe they need more bartenders to help all those people waiting for drinks on Saturday's. Also, bartenders should pay more attention to those who have been  waiting there longer to get their drink.<//Text>

<date>1597967768031< /date><rate>4<//rate><Text>Edit- My last post was a couple years ago, went back today (8/20/Rona). First time back since my dad passed, and Rona/heatwave makes life hard for everyone. Very attentive service and amazing spread on the menu (Rona has halved menus at some places). Only lack of star was that the quality of food went down just SLIGHTLY, but the staff was very considerate of my high maintenence and worked with me. Effective fans considering the heat, and love any wireless jukebox. Will absolutely go again.

OG Post- Very cool vibe. Neat building and food was better than most sports bars. Don't tell your friends- I don't need to compete with a crowd.< /Text>< pics>

My favorite place to enjoy a game and have a drink.  You cant beat the service as all of the bartenders and servers are the best around.  A true hometown bar experience.<//review>

This place use to be good.  I had a discrepancy on my bill and they wouldn't even help me out, they just said it is what it is.  This place sucks they're going to charge you way more than that you should be charged.  It used to be such a fun place to hang out at.< /review>

The 55 Yard Line is the best sports bar in San Marcos! They have 24 Flat Screen TV's with every game on that you would want to watch. I love their Lunch Special! Where else can you get a craft burger and seasoned fries for $8.95? This place is awesome!<//Review>

The waitress was a joke, unfriendly and mostly rude/mean. Thankfully she drank 3 beers at the bar. After that she was friendly. Total bogus that she charged everyone in my group, there were 5 of us, we each had to go to the bar for everything, she tipped herself and we had NO choice. Since we paid individually she got a free $8 - $10 from everyone!!! So for doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, well to be fair, she did get drunk, she went home with $50 to $60 dollars in UN-earned tips!! Will never return!! I tell everyone Do NOT go unless you want to be robbed. Idc that it was $10, I served myself.< /Text>

I used to love coming here and getting the loaded tots and having a couple of brews. I like to bring my own hot sauce and had done it over ten times but an overzealous doorman told me I couldn't. You have lost my business 55!</Review>

This place was super crowded and noisey every time I've been in there. If your looking for that type of atmosphere, than this place is for you. But don't expect more than that. Food isn't so hot, and the service sucks. Only thing that is good about it is the pool tables, if you can ever get a game in.< /Review>

< Review>
Only reason I give 2 stars is because the majority of the staff is great and the food is good. OK beer selection and great TVs. However, if the owner sucks then it ruins the experience. He is blatantly, stubbornly and shockingly more concerned with making his own enjoyment and preferences priority over his customers. If this was a first time offense I would usually assume it's just a fluke since the staff is so good and I hate writing bad reviews, but this is my third bad experience with Jim personally. Maybe instead of being concerned with informing me how much money he spent on the fight, he should have tried a little harder to change just one of the 20+ TVs away from the pre fight fights and to the 4th quarter of Clippers game 7. Again not a first time offense with TV arrangements and arrogance on his part sadly. Finally learned my lesson, won't be taking our business there again. Thanks!<//Review>

So many tvs your head will spin. Good local beers, foods good. Sticks & zukes need breading, not batter. Just sayin.

Staff was super-friendly, & great.

<text>The 55 Yard line is a Chargers bar, but as a born & bred local that also means were not that passionate about them. We welcome everyone, even that one Raiders fan. You will always see Denver fans. As a city of transplants we understand that and respect is returned.

It can get packed, SRO, but with the chargers being especially disappointing it’s less so. Having a BWW right next door doesn’t help business either, so this really does become a locals only hang out.

They offer more local and craft beers than more widely popular restaurant/bars like The Draft and the food is solid offering Artichoke Dip, cheese filled pretzels. Solid fries and onion rings. Prices on beers (craft are 6-7) while the domestics are a buck or two cheaper. They offer most beers in a pint or 23 oz. Burgers are good, better than most places.

Service is good at the bar and seated because they have staffing running through all areas pretty steady you usually don’t have to flag anyone down. I steer clear of cocktails involving more than 3 ingredients.  Stick to beer. Glassware is clean and surprisingly new, generally places that push a lot of beer tend to not update their glassware as often as they should. Jim the owner is a good dude, always here working.

Outdoor patio is really only where smokers hang out and some TV’s have a few second delay, you can tell the upgrades and renovations were done in stages as many of the TV’s don’t match. Pool outsideThis place is dead outside of football and basketball season. Summertime Sadness.</text>< Rate>

<Text>Doorman refused to let me in. Seemed very homophobic and our refusal of entry felt very much like a targeted action. He made us embarrassed in front of multiple people as he yelled at us to 'stand single file' while he let others whisp in before us. He then checked our ID'd with flashlights and denied me entry? It was the most bizarre and humiliating experience in my life.< /Text>< date>

<date>1616305357496< /date><text>A tranquil, beautiful, and large park located in the north Davis. There‘s two playground for kids, lots of open area and walking paths. Grass and trees are well-maintained. It’s a great place for walking, jogging, picnic, playing, or just taking a nap. What I love the most is the middle pond surrounded by reed. You can easily find different kinds of birds there: Canada goose, red-winged blackbird, American coot, and red-shouldered hawk. Parking lot is not that busy even on the weekend.</text><gmapID>0x808529c5a7f79a09:0xda3003c0482d5370</gmapID>< rating>

<text>The park feels bigger than expected, and the pond decks feel cozy and a bit secluded. The soccer field is large and has a comfortable feel to it, surrounded by trees. Two playgrounds on either side. Lovely choice for a running game, day with the family, or sweetheart picnic. I brought my book and relaxed - perfect setting for it.</text><Gmap_id>0x808529c5a7f79a09:0xda3003c0482d5370<//Gmap_id><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

One of the nicest parks in Davis.  Well cared for grass. There is a soccer field here where sports teams can practice and hold tournaments. The pond is a great spot to watch both local and migratory birds.<//review>

<Text>This is a very large and beautiful park. The nature trail is cool. Please watch put for frogs as a young nature person is warning is. 😉 There is a huge soccer field. There is a shaded picnic area. Nearby is a very fun play structure for the kids. A nice wide bike/walking path takes you to the rest rooms. Along the way you pass by the big pond. There I a lot of room to run around and play. Definitely, stay out of the pond. And be gentle if you find a frog. Another great Davis park.</Text>< pictures>

I think the bagels are great, but I'm not a New Yorker. They do often run out of some varieties so you may need to get there early to get what you want.</text>

< Review>
Wandered through this park a few days ago and it was quite cute and pleasant. It has a decent trail and a quaint pond in the middle of it. The park connects to many parts of the neighborhood, and seems like the perfect way to sneak in an after work bike ride. It's well lit and has a good deal of wild life. It has some good peace of mind to it and is in the middle of the suburbs. From an outsider's perspective it's a very decent neighborhood park.<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Expansive green area with a multitude of outdoor uses. Two playgrounds, multiple soccer fields, walking paths, contemplative dirt pathways, and even a pond surrounded by reeds and a diversity of amphibians and birds.
While the lone bathroom makes sense the lack of additional drinking fountains is a little odd.< /review>< pictures>

Beautiful park in the green belt system which is the only redeeming quality I can perceive of in a terribly boring town aside from voting yes on every education tax put before the citizens, the latter of which I'm a benefactor of.<//review>

Very clean, very peaceful, and lots of people with their puppies/doggies. Very California-esque, haha. I'm from Las Vegas and the parks over there and nowhere near as big and beautiful as this.</review>

<Review>I love this park.  Last summer I broke my foot and had a knee walker to roll around on the greenbelt.  I would walk 2-4  miles everyday.  I realized how bad the greenbelts in Davis are for people that need assistance and/or use wheeled devices. Bicycles as well. The asphalt has big cracks, and bumps made by tree roots.  I almost fell down several times during my walks with wheels.  I think it is tricky using a wheeled device if you don't pay close attention to the terrain.  A level stretch of cement is located North of Sandpiper, Covell Drainage Channel that runs about 3 blocks. Can be accessed on Sandpiper Drive on the East end at the curve.  It would be great for all if our greenbelt paths could be made with cement.</Review>< user>

Two large soccer fields very well maintain fields.
If soccer fields are not in use great place to play Frisbee or just kicking the ball around, nice place to picnic and lay around in the grass.
There is also a walk way around the pond area.<//Text>

I went there about three weeks ago. I was there about the time they said it would be ready. I waited an additional 20 minutes for which they apologized and said they would make it up by giving me the next pizza free. I thought, sure. Fast forward to 4/19. I called in the order for two pizzas and advise them that I was told to just mention that I had a free pizza coming to me.

After speaking with Hanna, it was confirmed and got two pizzas for $20. Needless to say I took tipped them well for their efforts. This is a business with integrity, and a business that truly values their customers. I won’t go anywhere else for my Round Table Pizza!< /Review>

I went their for the Buffet Lunch
(M-F 11am to 2pm) and they had only 2 well picked over regular size multi- flavored pizza's slices and a mediocre salad bar prepared for the entire buffet! Chopped iceberg lettuce was not fresh  and looked like it had gone past it's expiration date!
About 15 minutes into lunch,(I arrived at 12nn), they brought out 2 more multi- topped regular sized! No labels to describe the toppings and each tray had multiple varieties baked on the same single crust! Very sad to see this happening to a once great franchise!<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7sSV8pAX6lf45e3Ok-1jYW_pE82OcGcR1fjZm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x809ade25c6b52a27:0x57b9363498ca38a3< /gmapID></record>

We drive past a couple Round Tables to go here. I usually love their pizza and have gone here for years. They have been extra busy lately and burned the pizza two times in a row. Hope its not three strikes and your out. If they burn it again we will find another pizza place.<//text>

I finally got a messed up pizza! This has been my go to spot for a year. Not 1 messed up until last week. I can't stand pizza that's so thin in the center I can put my finger through it. I tried rolling up a piece to make a Calzone type thing. It didn't work. There was more crust on the edge than there was pizza. I called and said something. They said they would send me another pizza. The 2nd pizza was a little better. At least my finger didn't go straight through the slice. The driver asked to see the old pizza. I held up a slice and showed him how thin it was. He stood there with a straight face telling me that's how a pizza is supposed to be. I asked him politely to tell his manager that this is the reason I move on. There are many pizza places out there. If I can make it better at home why would I go back?< /text>

< review>
For the record, I've been eating at various Round Table Pizza restaurants since I was a young. It's my favorite local area pizza chain.
And this particular shop is one that I used to frequent back in the nineties when I had friends that worked there. So I have a pretty good idea of what to expect.
That being said, I really only have one complaint...
If you can't cook the pizza properly (make sure the dough is fully cooked) then maybe Monday Appreciation day should no longer exist.
I get that it's a promotion that fills the joint and that customers, like my wife, really appreciate because of the savings; but I've started to ignore the savings and save my stomach.
Last night was the first time in a while that we've been to this restaurant.
(Del's pizza up the street makes a great Garlic pizza and it's fully cooked, but expensive).
I won't be back again on a Monday as the problem still exists.
The Pizzas are fine on other days. But Mondays are a no go.< /review>

I have had the ocasion to order from this location many times, the people are very rude, refuse to take valid coupons that have their store address on it just because they were having trouble with the code. I have recieved my orse wrong, but excepted it anyway so the driver wouldn't have to go back, you would think that they would show they appreciate it on their end, but not here. I ordered and paid for soda to be delivered w my pizza, what they failed to mention is they changed the size.<//review>

Good pizza. Quoted time for pick up is pretty accurate as this location is generally busy. Coupons often in mailers and specials listed online. I recommend online ordering.<//review>

Pizza was hot and delicious with super fresh ingredients.  Kids got personal pizzas. Great pizzeria  atmosphere with games for kids and TVs for sports, tucked in a cute shopping center.</review>

<text>I have lived in the area for 13 years and I have consistently enjoyed eating here. Every Monday they get super swamped because large and extra large pizzas are half off. Every once in a while they might get something wrong but that's really unlikely. Amd they're always willing to fix any order no questions asked.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Ordered two medium pizzas that were different, to be delivered.  I live alone so I only opened one of the boxes. Next day opened the second box and order was wrong. Their "policy" unknown to me, was that you are supposed to open both boxes the same day. Not helpful in any way to rectify a simple matter.< /review>

A very warm and small Round Table. Good customer service,  but pizza wasn't as good as normal. Very crowded because of Monday's 50% off any large or extra large pizza..Toss up.</review>

First I will start with a positive. Pizza is great and up to par with where it should be. My reasoning for this review is to hopefully make one small change that makes a difference to people's opinion of a restaurant. We're paying good money for pizza and I think the level of customer service should be set highter than other places.

My small suggestion to you is that recently we bought a pizza and 2 liter and while picking up the pizza we wanted 1 ranch side for the pizza. We had already paid for the pizza and didn't have the change to purchase it. So therefor we went without. So either A) include 1 ranch for free and additional should be charge or B) While ringing up the customer you should train your staff to ask so that you can charge the customer up front. The main problem isn't the fee it's how it was handled. But, I do still think 1 ranch isn't asking too much when you're spending good money on pizza.

Just an idea. Hope you decide to improve that one small problem. If I visit again and it changes I will gladly raise the 3 star review.

Thanks so much. Enjoy.</Text>

I give this place a -5 review. This place is a complete joke. You want to make false accusations about your best customers then go ahead. Not only have you lost my respect...you lost my business! Negative reviews travel ten times faster than positive ones! Before you accuse customers of giving you fake money, you better have your facts straight.< /review>

<review>This is the best Round Table usually.  Recently I ordered a medium supreme which left me disappointed.  The edges were burnt and had large bubbles which meant no toppings.  This time the pizza was a real let down.  Skimpy toppings almost no olives or onions . Think I'll take a break from here. Hopefully next time I order the pizza will be as it normally is . Couldn't even enjoy the leftovers,  too burnt.</review>< pics>

He only had 3 pizza up and only one was half pepperoni. Can not eat any other pizza due to allergies. We asked the owner to do another pepperoni due to allergies, he refused due to there were only 3 people in his establishment, then advised me I should have ordered my own pizza, if I needed something special. I  did not know pepperoni is considered a special pizza. I had 3 slices of a small pepperoni pizza. I asked for my money back on my meal only, owner refused... unsure where the customer service is, but it is not here.</Review><Name>Deborah Richardson< /Name>< GmapID>

Went there for the lunch buffet. The pizza looked like it had been sitting out for an hour. When I asked when they were going to put fresh pizzas out, I was told, "Not until the others are gone." Will never go there again<//review>

<Text>I've ordered at least 25 pizza's from this location.  It is Monday and the large and x-large pizzas are half off so it's incredible busy. I have an issue with an Italian Garlic pizza having so much garlic on it that it actually burns your mouth when you eat it. I called the restaurant and someone claiming to own the place(Mark) told me he personally weighed the garlic, and it is exactly like all the other 20 I've ordered over the last year.  He actually argued with me on the phone over this.  I just wanted a new one made and finally said he would, but someone that defensive, willing to argue with a customer scares me, and I would not want any food made by him.  He gave the impression that he would do something to the replacement.  He lost my business I guess customers aren't that important.< /Text>< gmapID>

<Review>I have ordered from here several times and this time I have to say was the worst. Placed the order at722pm, the guy on the phone took my order then said it would be about 50-55 minutes. My response was "wow really"?
Then he just repeated himself and ended the call. After about hour and ten minutes I call back to find out where the pizza is and had a girl answer who asked me several questions before she could find my order?? When she finally found it she insisted that the guy I placed the order with told me it would be 60-65 minites. I hung up with only receiving a discount on my order which is the coupon I always use. As I write this review it is now 843pm and the pizza has still not arrived. The worst customer service.
And to add I am a whole 10 minutes from their location.....

Update pizza finally arrived at 855pm was luke warm and vastly under cooked. We called them asked for a new pizza to be sent they told us it would be another hour before it got here. We asked if the driver come back and get the pizza and gives our money back. She said it would be another 45 minutes before they could do that. After about ten minutes of being on the phone with a very disrespectful female employee we offered to bring the pizza back and get our money to go and get dinner else where....it should not take one and a half hours to get a pizza from a place only ten minute down the road....

will never order from here again.
Subpar pizza for the price and terrible service✌️😑👎🏻🍕< /Review><user_id>107468878501301823653< /user_id>< GmapID>

<text>Ordered a pizza for delivery not long ago and it was delivered cold and yes, i knew it was overpriced. Ordered a pizza tonight and before  the order was finalized , was disconnected. There are so many choices today along the Sunrise Blvd. Corridor i don't need to rely on people who don't care about their jobs while paying a premium  price for cold mediocre food.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

They messed up my order 3 out of the last 10 times I've been there. Bad batting average, if you ask me.  They also messed up a previous customer's order & tried to sell it to me at a discount, before I even went in to pick up my already messed up order.<//text>

It's a really nice community, very friendly. I have always been attending this church ever since I was a child. I'm surprised this church doesn't have a website. In my opinion, they really need a website that can: answer FAQ, Hours of the Mass, Weddings, Baptism, First communions, Funerals, Quinces, and be able to make appointment with the priests or anybody working for the church.</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dcb7203f036847:0x177900ea3ec36c23< /GmapID></record>

i love god and everything, and i love going to mass but this church has bad people when they give the bread, this one guy tried to pick a fight with me all because i was smiling. He even went as far as grabbing my shirt and yelling in my ear to stop doing that he Told me " This is not place to smile". being my self i smiled more them he grabbed my shirt even more. Me knowing i was in a safe place i still got attacked by one of there people.< /Text>

I grew up in this church since I was a baby and I can honestly say it is the most amazing church I've been to. Its an honor going to mass every Sunday I love my church . I've seen many people come and go but the church is still standing . 💜</Review>

<text>The website has wrong times, 1130 is a Spanish sermon.

When I showed up some very helpful ppl let me know English sermons are at 930 and 430

Attendee the 430 but turns out to be both Spanish and English. From what I could understand seems like it's dominantly done in Spanish and few parts are done in English.

Instead of having a version in English then Spanish the speaker would say most in Spanish and say a little part of his sermon in english.

Will come to 930 sermon hoping for a sermon in english</text>< username>

It is very well distributed and serves in several languages. It has a source within it that makes it special because it is not common.

< review>
(Translated by Google) I got married in this church almost 16 years ago, it's sad to call on the phone and no one answers your call. A recorder is your answer when calling. Perhaps there are no more human beings on the other side of the line. I wonder what it is about the lives of those people calling trying to find a response that at that moment is decisive for the direction of their lives.
But he could not contact the pastor for lack of human beings to answer his call.
God willing this does not happen in all churches.

(Original)
Me case en esta iglesia hace casi 16 años, es triste llamar por telefono y que nadie atienda tu llamada. Una grabadora  es tu respuesta al llamar. Acaso ya no hay seres humanos del otro lado de la linea. Me pregunto que es de la vida de aquellas personas llaman tratando de encontrar una repuesta que en ese momento es determinante para el rumbo de sus vidas.
Pero no pudo contactar al pastor por falta de seres humanos que contestaran a su llamada.
Dios quiera que esto no pase en todas las iglesias.</review>

<Review>The tacos are good and the price is right. Depending on who is at the register you might even get service with a smile. The red salsa is almost hot enough.< /Review>< gmapID>

I celebrated my graduation last night in this great restaurant. I am glad to say that we passed a terrific evening and the venue was absolutely the reason for that happy gathering. The team  participated in a graceful way, the meals were tasty and my guests were very  glad. We shall absolutely come back again for more joyful events. Thank you very much.<//review>

We were looking for a no-chain coffee shop for breakfast. We found Dos Hermanos. It exceeded our expectations. My breakfast burrito was eggxcelent and they were accommodating to my daughter's vegan diet. She ordered the burrito in a bowl. Our order took about 20 minutes but everything was fresh and yummy. The wait was totally worth it. Also, there's a sign telling you about the wait which I think is really useful. The person at the register was helpful and cordial.< /Review>

GREAT FOOD!! My favorite thing from their menu is the hard shell tacos with avocado but my family always ends up buying 20 or more of the little soft tacos. Friendly service and not a bad wait time for your food!</Review>

I love their friendly staff and all their food tastes fresh.  I'm a regular here, because of that. When I place my order over the phone they don't even ask for my name anymore, because they recognize whos ordering, but it's like that for others as well.  They make you feel at home. You have got to love a place like that. 💖 I see a lot of regulars there, i'm not the only one.</text>

<text>We were traveling and our two year old daughter needed to use the restroom. We asked politely, were denied, purchased a bean burrito so our daughter could use the restroom, and left. Bathroom was DISGUSTING. Burrito was cold, and beans dried out and stale with no cheese. Do not stop here, just move right on through.</text><UserId.>112458135376651793251<//UserId.>< resp>

<Response>None</Response><Text>In the continuing effort to locate, taste and report on the breakfast burritos of the county, I bring Dos Hermanos Breakfast burritos. What fun, A nice drive to San Miguel to test another burrito. The place is busy, I mean busy, 20 minutes for a burrito. There are locals, to go orders, soldiers from Camp Roberts, and us! Popular, or the best place in town.. Well that is for each individual to decide. I had the chili verde breakfast burrito and my son had the bacon burrito. We were both very pleased with the content, size, preparation and flavors. I will be returning and bringing friends, relatives and others to this place to test the menu further. The staff are working their tails off as they serve both the in house and to go orders and are oh so polite and pleasant as they work. I will be back. Thank you Dos Hermanos! And I love the murals and the colorful decor, both inside and out! If you are on the freeway, pull off and enjoy a burrito, or call in an order and enjoy it in the park just up the street, either way it is a good stop.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Time>

<gmap_id>0x80eccd9b5f644adb:0x19474e7ef4201cef< /gmap_id><text>We first discovered this restaurant while driving down to SoCal on our way to Arizona, a couple of years ago (our home is in the East Bay Area near SF). Wanting just a snack, I chose a couple of chili verde tacos. MMMMMM; my mouth came alive with the wonderful flavor! From that trip onward, we make sure to stop whenever possible (almost any trip down or back up the 101), to get our chili verde fix. The combo plate is especially satisfying, which includes high quality refried beans and Mexican rice, along with tortillas. I'm honestly not sure I've ever had better chili verde, which is one of my go-to Mexican favorites. I hear people talk about the tamales and burritos, too, which I'm sure I'll try at some point.< /text><Name>Kurt Robinson<//Name>< Rate>

First  time here and first Mexican restaurant that doesn't offers chips and salsa.. we wait for our food half an hour,  and they mess up with our order so my mother in law,  had to wait even longer, by the time we go our order we did not had any drinks, and i was almost done with my food..  "it take them half an hours to serve our food and there was not one else here..."<//Review>

Good burritos,  disappointed,  I tried calling to place a order as soon as they open for a burrito, and they never answer the phone, I went there and ask the girl there if they dont like answering the phone, she stated to me , they dont answe until later. Why have a phone if you dont answer.  It makes it easier for people that go to work to order ahead of time.</Text>

<review>All I can say is WOW!! I love chili verde, have tried it all over Monterey and San Luis Obispo Counties and this restaurant has the best! Everything we ordered was great! They are very friendly and aim to please! I am so impressed I ordered chili verde to serve at my family's reunion! Can't wait for that!<//review>< pictures>

DO NOT go there to pick something up without calling in your order first.  You will sit there for 30-45 min while they make all the pick up orders while you sit there waiting.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) In the scorching heat we arrived here and ate very well. Very friendly staff - and everything is fresh, so no fast food in the strict sense. WC is also available and provided with a combination lock, the combination of which is experienced by the staff. We would return here.

In glühender Hitze sind wir hier eingekehrt und haben sehr gut gegessen. Sehr freundliche Mitarbeiter - und alles wird frisch zubereitet, also kein Fastfood im engeren Sinne. WC ist auch vorhanden und mit einem Zahlenschloss versehen, dessen Kombination man beim Personal erfährt. Wir würden hier wieder einkehren.<//text>

<review>Very professional. Got me in quickly once I expressed concern about my dog. All test results came back quickly. They were great with follow up even down to ordering my dogs food. Happy dog is a healthy dog!</review>< Pics>

I have taken Midnight there twice now, once for his annual medical check-up and shots, and just a few days ago for another issue he had.  I appreciate that I can get him in there pretty fast.  They are local to where I live, and I appreciate that, as he does, also.  I would recommend this vet and their practice.<//text>

<Text>My daughter and I have adopted several rabbits over the last few year and when we've needed help Dr. Gueniat and her staff have been there for us. Monday afternoon one of our rabbits was bitten by his cousin and MAMC made time for us to be seen. Not only did they take us without an appointment, they cared for our rabbit, and were able to do so in a timely manner. Furthermore, the Dr took time to chat with us, especially my daughter, about rabbit and the care he'd need after the visit. While I hope we never have more rabbit emergencies, I know that if we do where we will go: Monrovia Animal Medical Center.</Text><user_id>105674948729891163965< /user_id>< response>

They didnt have any available appointments for that day but gave her a few numbers to call for immediate service as they were concerned for the piggie.  After reaching out and finding that not too many people service guining pigs or had availalbe appointments we called back and took the earliest appointment which was a Friday morning.  We called upon arrival, a nurse came out to get our information and take duck back.  Then the doctor came out to give us the feedback.  She really wanted to assure us that nothing would gaurantee if the piggie lived or not but gave us detail instructions on what to do when we went home.  I am happy to say that Duck is doing well now.  He is eating and gaining weight again.  I am so happy that we found this vet.  The price wasn't expensive for us and they take care credit.< /Text>< pictures>

Fallows COVID-19 guidelines, humans wait in their cars while the pets are examined and treated in the medical center. Staff wears masks while practicing social distancing. My experience on 12/29/2020, the vet contacted me by phone to give a report on my pet. The service and respect is still exceptional.<//text>

<rate>1</rate><text>I took my dog in for an infection he got in his paw. The lady at the front desk was pretty nice but my main problem was with the Dr. Gueniat who was VERY rude. I had a payment issue and she was very degrading and made it seem like I couldn't afford the service even when I tried to suggest a solution. She started to mention that she had an emergency and needed to leave and even started sharing the details of her emergency which I thought was just flat out unprofessional. I understand that in an emergency people get frantic but the way she went about it was really RUDE. Not only that but for being in a rush she shaved off a patch of my dogs paw for absolutely no reason. This is the FIRST and LAST time I come to this vet!</text>< GmapID>

Also...the new client discount was a nice surprise....made cost very  reasonable for elderly lady on fixed income. Thank you so much!!☺<//Review>< date>

This is a great veterinary hospital with a terrific veterinarian.  I cannot say how much I appreciate Dr. G and her staff for the way they have cared for my dogs over the last 2 years.  I even use them for boarding when I travel – they have a very nice boarding facility and the dogs get good care and attention while I am away.  I know I have nothing to worry about when Monrovia Animal Medical Center is there for us.</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><username>Nikkie Moon< /username><Review>We have trusted Dr G and her team to care for all of our furry family members for many many years now (approximately 10 years).  Dr. G is an incredible clinician.  Honestly, the care she provides us and our animals with, exceeds many human physicians!  She is so intelligent, knowledgable, reasonable, caring, and kind! We had seen other vets before and always felt like they were trying to make money off of us by ordering unnecessary tests or procedures..... not Dr. G and her staff! They are not the cheapest or biggest practice but they are by far the best quality care team i have ever seen! They really are a wonderful team at Monrovia Animal Medical Center! Dr. Gueniat is truly the most exceptional veterinarian I have ever met.  I am an ICU nurse and she explains  every detail and every lab so that i can fully understand what is going on with any of my pets.  They are all amazing.  Jennifer, Nshan and Kiars are also incredible!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I am so fortunate to have found this practice. Dr Gueniat is a expert in treating animals. This is the very first vet I have been to that didn't make me feel that I needed to have multiple costly test done to diagnose and treat a simple problem.
She was very focused on my German shepards symptoms and simply used what is just common sense with her years of experience to treat her. Wow! Her staff was so gentle with my Shepard too. Aware that a dog her age has painful hip problems. I was grateful over there concern for how she was having to deal with this pain everyday as well. Dr G provided some pain relief that made her feel so much better than I had seen in a long time.
Thank you Dr. G and staff we will be clients forever.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<text>The best veterinarian in California and maybe the World! I had taken my cat to 3 other vets and none of them could diagnosed my cat's illness until stepping foot in this clinic. Dr. Gueniat was very professional and caring, she specially took her time to analyze my cat's problem deeply instead of doing a battery of expensive tests. Please go to her because she is reliable, honest, caring, and with many years of experience. If you had enough of bad vets who only care to make money then it's time for you to visit the Monrovia Animal Medical Center.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><user_id>116723560581173766204</user_id>< username>

Dr. Gueniat and the rest of the staff at this clinic were very helpful when I took in my guinea pig Rufus for a check up. The nurse was gentle with my pet and made sure he was comfortable and not scared for when the doctor came in to check on him. Doc was very informative on what I need to keep my guinea pig healthy. I'm very glad to know I have a reliable vet on hand for Rufus.< /Text>

Dr.Gueniat and the staff of Monrovia Animal Hospital are very professional,courteous, and very compassionate to the needs of animals and owners.
They are totally dedicated to all animals needs and the facility is excellent meeting all needs, including boarding your pets.
My Dog is high maintenance and Dr. G & her staff are amazing with him and they have taught me so much about animal behavior. I highly recommend Dr. Guerniat and her staff.< /text>

<review>I am writing this review because I see all the negative reviews and I am shocked!  Dr Gueniat is an extremely caring, knowledgeable veterinarian.  People have complained about her manner and her need to get paid for her services.  First of all, her manner.  Dr. Gueniat is European.  She has a different style or "bed side" manner because of her culture but she is NOT cold and uncaring.  She has had a deep love for animals since childhood.  Once you understand her manner you realize this.  I see complaints about her requiring payment for her services.  HELLO!  She is a highly trained professional and small business owner.  She is not in the business of giving free advice.  I don't understand people who expect to get something for nothing.  My family has lived in Monrovia for 24 years and we have been to several local vets for our animal care over the years.  We have been to VCA Santa Anita and Dr Domotor's Animal House.  We started going to Dr. Gueniat's Medical Center because we found those places to be too big and uncaring and they seemed to be only really concerned about the money.  I do not see the advantage in going to a large veterinarian that is full of barking dogs and people and runs you through like an assembly line.  The Animal Medical Center is small and friendly and Dr. Gueniat is an excellent vet that will give your pet the care it deserves.  She is well worth her fees!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

My parents used to go here and one day I decided to go there for my puppy, I asked a few questions about simple puppy care tips and she gave me very dim replies, pushing me to pay an office visit of $60 for her"professional time." She really made it seem as if she didnt care about us unless we paid. Believe me tho, once we payed a "discounted price" she opened as if all she cared about was my dog. Loaded me up with hundreds of dollars worth of things that my dog really didnt need. I also got quoted a  dog spay (which they will NOT hand out unless u pay for it). $700 for my dog was the quote.That was their "low end". Also forget negotiating what your dog needs or doesntn need. Shell make you fell like your the worst person for not paying herf ridiculous bill. Forget it, i went elsewhere, asked my questions,got replies,got a spay estimate, all WITHOUT an exam. Of course i stood switched over! I even got my parents to switch over, they get the same service but with a kinder attitude and a lower bill. The place is always dead when you visit the place too. Ive gone there billions of times with my parents. Talk to the receptinists too, faces always change, no one ever works there longer than two years. Something is wrong here and Itll cost you to find out!!
PS Dont offer me an "open and personalized communication" like the last gal. Having know you, that means "come on in but payme $60 first". It takes a lot to become a veterinarian in these states, but school isnt all of it. What all the reviews are pointing at is this: You really dont have what it takes to be a vet.There is alot of heart and personality that goes into it and you simply dont have that. One day you will be closed down and maybe youll see. Harsh, but thats business.<//Review>

I have been taking my cats to Monrovia Animal Medical Center for many years.  "Dr. G" and the staff are great.  Dr. G was very comforting when I had to put my beloved Patches to sleep.  I was not expecting the bad news, and, although I was very upset, she gently persuaded me to do what needed to be done.  Right afterward, Patches' brother Wynerino was diagnosed with hyperthyroid and I thought I would lose him too.  Dr. G discussed all the options and referred me to AVMI in Tustin for treatment, and they were wonderful.  Dr. G monitored the treatment with AVMI, lets me ask questions by email regarding follow-up care (e.g., Wynerino's lack of appetite), and is handling the check-ups.  We still have a way to go, but so far so good.  I highly recommend Monrovia Animal Medical Center and sincerely thank Dr. G for getting my sweethearts through a very difficult time.</Text>

Dont get your dryers here, they wont work and they will tell you that your house is the problem when the dryer they gave you is bunk. Their mechanic tested and even said it was broken then got mad when we were correct that it was broken.< /Review>

Great place. Knowledgeable staff for DIYers. Was 90% there fixing an old gas range and Seth got me over the finish line. Shelley was an excellent marketer. If you have rentals, flip houses, or just looking to replace your older appliances with something in good working order at a good price, this is the spot.< /text>

<Text>So I called this place and talked to whom I’m guessing is the owner and was told I could bring my like new stove I just bought into this place and do a trade and possibly cash exchange for my electric stove for a gas stove. Mind you this stove is pretty much spotless super clean and I was willing to also pay whatever difference in cash. The guy I believe his name is micheal! Doesn’t even come out to look at the stove in the back of my truck stands there peaked out the window and says “yea we’re not buying that stove”! Proceeds to tell me they will pretty much take the stove off my hands so they can profit from this like brand new stove and I could buy a brand new stove from them! I’ve never dealt with people so unprofessional like these people I do not recommend them wasted my time after telling me that yes it can be exchanged!<//Text><rate>1</rate><gmapID>0x8083277a00102661:0xe3072c9ca18db621</gmapID></record>

Freezer works great, but fridge side won't cool.  I spent three hours troubleshooting my "Broken" fridge, to be sure I called Appliance Resale because for $60 they will diagnose or repair the fridge. So their "Experienced" tech comes to Diagnose my refrigerator. He walks in, looks for the manual to the fridge, can't find it. Asks me what the problem is, I say the Diffuser Is my guess. He looks at it, tests nothing and says Yep, it's the diffuser and calls me later for a $112 quote, Plus labor, Plus the $60 fee. I've been troubleshooting for years, and I can't "Diagnose" without testing, troubleshooting, using a Voltmeter etc.  Call Northern Valley Appliance, or Tri-County Appliance...cause Appliance Resale Sucks!!!!!!!</review>

This company is first class, although I feel the range I purchased should have been checked out better before they sold it, they stood behind it all the way. First the oven igniter was not working so Nathan came out and replaced it. While he was there he noticed that the top burner igniter was also not working like it should so he ordered it and came out the next day and replaced it as well. He did all that at our house under warranty at no cost to us. I will definitely use and refer this company in the future.</text>

<text>I don't have a problem with the owners but our apartments have provided 2 washers both of which have broken and the delivery guy is HORRIBLE.

<text>Johnny from Maintanence was amazing! We needed help when we moved and he was super helpful.
Few weeks later our place needed a few more touches and he came back and fix everything. He is very professional and kind.
Everyone here is amazing! If you are  looking for the best place to live look NO farther, Park 12 is your place.< /text>< Pictures>

As a vendor, I've partnered with Park 12 to host events for residents. The complex is located just outside the Gaslamp hub, and feels very safe and secure with electronic keys required to enter the building. The grounds are well manicured and the community event spaces are decorated with modern furniture and designs. Many also have incredible skyline views.

I've worked with Gabrielle to host on-site events for residents and she, as well as other Park 12 employees are always polite, professional and easy to work with. Gabrielle greets residents warmly, and accommodates each guest's unique needs. I've partnered with other luxury apartment buildings to host events and this location is my favorite!<//review>

<Text>Just moved in and already in love! Great community, amenities and view of downtown and the water. Sunsets are my fav! The only thing I would recommend is opening more amenities up to be more aligned with the city and state. 4 ppl in the gym at 1 time is too strict.<//Text><Rate>5< /Rate><time>1620267955958<//time><Gmap_id>0x80d9535c913e73b3:0x2cb20fed6f4bf68< /Gmap_id>< user>

Park 12 is a wonderful, bright and clean place to live. All the other residents I’ve encountered so far are happy and friendly.
I’ve lived in a few other “luxury” apartment complexes in San Diego, where the units are lovely, but management was a nightmare to deal with. So looking for my next home, knowing management can make or break a resident’s experience, I placed high priority on the attitude and helpfulness of the staff I encountered. My expectations were surpassed on all accounts—my leasing agent Valentino made the signing process so much easier and stayed in constant contact with me to make sure everything was on target for my move-in. I couldn’t imagine a more seamless move-in day: the leasing office staff that day helped me an hour earlier than opening so that I could make my appointment with the BigBox storage company. Using the loading dock conveniently located next to a reserved elevator just for move-ins shows that Park 12 thought of everything for their residents. Common areas are always clean. The security guards that I always see walk around are super friendly and make me feel safe in the building. The surrounding area is lovely with lots of shops and restaurants, and right next to a trolley stop. Thanks Park12, I am so happy here!< /Review>

I stepped into this cute coffee shop in the beautiful Park 12 Collection complex. The cappuccino was made to perfection and the barista was exceptional. There were Park 12 Collection residents attending a yoga class. The Park 12 Collection is located near
The pedestrian bridge in the heart of downtown San Diego and adjacent to
The baseball field. The entire experience was beautifully picturesque.<//Text>

<Review>Have lived at Park 12 since Jan 2019.  Love the building and the staff is great.  Very professional and helpful.  Johnny in Engineering really helped me out recently with an issue with my dryer.  The issue had been happening for quite some time as it was hard to diagnose.  Johnny went the extra mile to figure it out and we were able to get it resolved.  So nice to have it working properly.  Would really recommend this building to anyone wanting to live in a great downtown environment with great views and really cool amenities.

Super cool mixology Zoom call tonight that Gabrielle arranged.  P12 has gone a great job of setting up events for residents to participate in during Covid.  Nicolas from Angels Envy gave a really fun and informative presentation.  Was really nice to attend.  :)</Review><resp>{'time': 1613500190184, 'text': "Steven Tobey, thanks for your praise and kind comments about our team.

<Review>The apartment itself is lovely! The amenities are amazing and the staff is extremely nice. However we had a hard time with the move in process. We didn’t receive a move in letter until 2 days before move in, even though we should have received it 2 weeks earlier when we signed the lease. Didn’t get mail keys at first and when we did, they didn’t tell us our box number. Also after sending our renters insurance proof via email, we were still charged extra for renters insurance. All of this was fixable, but it was really inconvenient for us to have to continue to bug the staff about this. We love this apartment and love being here, but the move in process was rough.<//Review><user>110668021477796528155<//user><user_name>Elizabeth Raines< /user_name>< gmapID>

An awesome place to call home!

We've been here about 2 months, and so far I have found nothing negative about this place. The views of Petco Park, Point Loma and the Pacific Ocean from our higher floor are absolutely stunning.

The appliances are brand new and top-notch, and the geek in me just loves the fact that I was able to choose which fiber internet provider I wanted - AT&T or Cox. Both offer full gig speeds up and down here at the building. Throw in the eight CAT6 network drops that are located throughout the apartment and you have a home network that is pretty much the envy of any tech person - which is who they are probably targeting.

The central A/C works great. The floor to ceiling windows in the living room and bedroom are very nice. There’s nothing quite like waking up and looking at Petco Park or watching a Navy ship return to port.

Parking is provided via the gated underground garage.  First space is free, unlike other downtown apartments that charge over $100 per month for your first parking spot. Parking spaces are wide, which is probably a good thing, as there are a lot of high end cars in the garage.  The proximity of the Gaslamp Quarter is just icing on the cake.

I almost forgot to mention the staff.  They are wonderful.

What's not to love :)

UPDATE - 11 May

I still give this place 5 stars. All of the amenities are now up and running. No issues with the homeless like some other reviewers have stated. Area around Park 12 is MUCH better than the rest of East Village - It’s all part of living downtown.

I will definitely renew my lease :)<//review>< name>

<text>I am a new resident to Park 12 and I was very hesitant with becoming a renter again after being a homeowner for over 12 years.  But, I was seeking a change in scenery and very much so wanted to experience living in Downtown San Diego again with my son.  I am a native San Diegan and I had toured several apartment buildings over several weeks and finally came across Park 12.  Being that we are currently in the midst of a pandemic my expectations were high as it relates to safety and customer service.  First impressions are extremely important to me and I was throughly impressed with the Leasing Office when I was greeted by Valentino Ward.  Of course he made sure we were masked and provided us with hand sanitizer to ensure our safety as we toured.  He was so personable, kind, and an attentive listener because I had a mental picture of exactly what I wanted my apartment to look like.  He was very patient with me as it took a few tries to find the perfect spot for my son and I.  I can say without any reservations that he helped me find exactly what I was looking for!  His level of customer service is exemplary and he evens takes the time to check in with us periodically to see how we are doing.  I am a very happy tenant at Park 12 and would recommend taking a tour if you are interested in experiencing what Downtown San Diego has to offer.< /text>< rating>

Worst experience of my life.

I reached out to park 12 asking for a certain type of apartment and they showed something to my satisfaction, i told them that i only visit here in America for school and I don’t have all the documents needed according to their website and the sales people told me they will check what they can do, a day after i got a call and they said if i provide a certain document i will be approved, i paid $550 for screening and applications fee and everything looked fine.
After waiting about 3 weeks, sleeping in hotels and waiting for my new apartment they called and said that there was a mistake and the corporate won’t approve my application without all the documents.
I was frustrated because i couldn’t provide those and i said it from the beginning, now i had to lose $50 for the cost of screening or what ever and i was fine with that. The remaining $500 should be sent to me through mail and guess what, it’s been 30 days and I haven’t received anything back. When i call they say it can take up to 90 days, when i ask for tracking number there is none, i offered to pay from my own pocket for over night shipping or a shipping with a tracking number and they won’t even allow me that giving me a ridiculous excuses.

That’s unbelievable and frustrating how a company which is that big act.<//Text>

I loved living there.  I relocated from Chicago and moved in a year ago.   I had to move again for work related reasons but was sad to leave.

My first day I had a problem with my movers and was both stressed and in a very bad mood.  I was not very nice to Gabrielle.    Not only did she  remain calm and professional, but she also calmed me down.  The rest of my move and year went great!

I also loved  the events that Gabrielle organized.  I was able to attend many both pre Covid and during the Covid restrictions.  I  appreciate  that they were able to do virtual  events and socially distanced events.  During a crazy time and being new to San Diego,  it gave  me a real sense of community and the ability to meet  neighbors.

I will miss the location of the property.  Even without live baseball, I loved being so close to Petco.
The building and neighborhood  has a great vibe.  I am going to miss it.  Hopefully,  I will be able to return.  I highly recommend  the building!
Thank you Gabrielle  and the Team for a great year in San Diego!!!< /Text>

I've been moving around the downtown area of San Diego for a bit now. A lot of apartments have "amenities," but nothing can hold a candle to Park 12. No gimmicks either, all well thought out,  well maintained and will definitely make life easier for you. All of the staff make me feel at home, Rachael and Gabrielle welcome me with a hello and ask me how my day has been every time i walk through the front door. I heard so many great things prior to moving in and it definitely lives up the hype!< /Text>

<Review>Would not recommend. It was a huge waste of money for me to live in this building The details in the building are not taken care of... Dirty elevators trash in the hallway that stays for 7 days or more... I've watched out of curiosity how long it would take the building maintenance to notice it. Over priced.

It was a huge waste of money And there's so many comparable high rise properties nearby for $700 less per month. Research and find one with a lower price point. Or if I was going to pay this amount of money I should have moved to Little Italy.< /Review><Rating>1<//Rating>< userid>

Would not recommend. It was a huge waste of money for me to live in this building The details in the building are not taken care of... Dirty elevators trash in the hallway that stays for 7 days or more... I've watched out of curiosity how long it would take the building maintenance to notice it. Over priced. And the true address for this building (and entrance into the parking garages is from Imperial avenue) is on Imperial Avenue. This is the end of East Village where there's tons of homeless near the trolley and bus station and St Vincent de Paul.

<Date>1567718229825< /Date><rating>1< /rating><review>I hope this review will help anyone who is thinking of renting here. I was an employee of Park 12 who has been here since the property opened and worked here until a few weeks ago. I was not fired and I am not a disgruntled employee. I am giving an honest unbiased review so I hope you take this for what it's worth.
The property itself is beautiful and I loved the residents here so much.  Unfortunately, over the last few months, the management team that is in place here has run Park 12 into the ground. They have absolutely no idea what they are doing and it is definitely starting to show. The leasing agents who are there do the best they can with minimal support from management. When the City building opened, management moved over there in an effort to completely wall themselves off from residents and staff. Any emails to management from staff members or residents go unanswered and if they do decide to respond they will only address what they feel like. Residents and staff are rarely told the truth (examples: parking: there is NO guest parking and information on amenities changes all the time).
I've been in this industry for almost 30 years and I've never seen a management team behave is such an unprofessional way. The biggest problem at Park 12 is the Leasing Manager . Rude and unprofessional and lacking any customer service skills, you can see why there are numerous negative reviews just about her on this very website. I'm shocked at how paying residents and their guests are treated and it's just disgraceful.
Management will lie to your face just to avoid telling you the truth. The amenities are nice but are not controlled or kept impeccably clean.The game room is a disaster with things always broken, and the pet park is a smelly disgusting mess.
Do yourself a favor and look at another property if you want to reside in the East Village. There are so many other options out there where you will be appreciated and respected. For the rents they are charging, it's not worth it, so I would suggest you look elsewhere. The residents and staff here at Park 12 DESERVE a better management team then what is in place here right now. It's a shame, because the property is nice, but when you have such an insufferable and incompetent management team, it makes living here as a resident a huge challenge. I hope this review helps you!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Beautifully designed building! The building is next to the Petco Park where San Diego Pedro plays their home games.  I heard a famous baseball player lives there.  The complex is so huge that it has multiple buildings by different names like a campus.<//Review>

As a business owner, you quickly realize that your environment reflects your work.. Park 12 makes living in downtown San Diego an absolute dream! My girlfriend and I love utilizing the Business Connect (professional work area), the beautiful gym, and the delicious Starbucks coffee machine. If you're looking for a living space that reflects creativity and the beauties of SoCal, I'd highly recommend experiencing Park 12 in person!< /Review>

<text>Living here has not been an enjoyable experience - I'm looking forward to my lease ending. I have been renting apartments for 15 years and I've never had an experience like this. If you are looking at a place to live at Park 12, I hope my review helps you ask the right questions so that you do not end up in my situation.

The only good thing about this place are the amenities, but even those (like the movie room and game room) always have issues. The staff (except for Kisa-she's awesome) is horrible at customer service and proper communication. For example: No one notified us ahead of time that Lyric was moving into the floor above us and re-doing those units to rent out as a hotel service. Because the Harbor and City buildings are made of sticks, it was incredibly loud and disruptive and vibrated our entire unit for weeks. Furthermore, now that the unit above us is a hotel service, there are people that are in and out and not aware of how their noises are affecting the people below them. Another example: The property insists on playing loud music in the courtyard and I have 2 speakers in front of my balcony - working from home is tough. I feel like I can't get peace and quiet in my own home and I have to always have the tv on to drown out the sounds. I have complained multiple times and Kisa was the only one who was helpful, but the music came back (with a vengeance) and remained on last night and played ALL NIGHT. WHY?! I try calling Greystar to discuss my issues and it is impossible to get anyone on the phone - the recording sends you to an "operator" that just is a voicemail and no one returns your call.< /text>< Resp>

***Customer Service at its finest...Thank you Mei-Lee***

As a military member I lived and visited countless places around the world. READ THIS CAREFULLY... I have never experienced the level of customer service provided by the leasing professional Ms. Mei-Lee Raya. She truly went above and beyond to ensure that was able to experience all that Park 12 had to offer unlike none other. She took descriptive videos, measurements, late phone calls and much more to ensure that I was making the most educated and informed decision, as I was attempting to lease a unit from 3,000 miles away. These words do not do her enough justice or appreciation. She has made this moving experience flawless and I love the new community that I am apart of. This will only improve exponentially once all the amenities are finished. The location is perfect. She along with the Park 12community  have my strongest recommendation of where you should live in you are in the renting market. Spend your money here I promise that you will not regret it.< /text>

<Review>Future Tenants BEWARE. There is a 3 million dollar renovation currently underway at Park 12. The building is only 2 years old and already a water main pipe burst on the 30th floor. All elevators were closed for 2 days and continue to have issues since. This forced me to climb up and down over 25 flights of stairs multiple times a day. What about the residents with physical disabilities? My parents were one of those people being trapped in my own apartment forced to spend the night without medication.

It has been over 2 weeks now and you have constant construction going on in the hallways. There is water damage on practically every floor. Moving crews and contractors pack the rarely available elevators with their equipment. You have to wait a life time just to be packed in like sardines.

I don't blame onsite management but at the corporate level they are dropping the ball. No type of compensation is being offered. I have other tenants passing out law firm business cards for people that want someone to help them break their lease.

For how much I pay to live here it's not worth this headache. I would expect this from Pinnacle but not Park 12. That's saying something.

Go to Shift or Alexan.< /Review>< Pictures>

Terrible experience had things stolen 3 times within a “secured” garage and management did nothing to help. You need to put cameras in the garage! It’s nearly impossible to reach someone by phone. You get the run around for days and no one knows what’s going on.<//Review>

I got a tour of this place last Sunday. Perhaps, I had much higher expectations but this is just a normal place with below average service and maintenance. Aside from a very poor showing experience by the sales person, there were some very noticeable issues with the place. The price is too high compared to what the place is. I noticed dog poop in non-pet areas during the tour. There was also ashes of burnt things in some corners of the building. We visited several floors and there was a very strong smell of garbage on every floor which was confirmed by the tour person as well. The place is too far from any of the highways with less of a 5 exception. Obviously, Park 12 is right next to Petco Park, so there will be a delay getting in and out of the building with a car. And they seem to be very disorganized with their appointments too. Some of the apartments we were toured were poorly laid out with a lot of wasted space. Some views of apartments were spectacular. They do have pools, a gym and a business center but that's nearly any building in downtown now; nothing special about that. Overall, it is really hard to justify paying that high of a price for such poorly maintained place.<//review>

< Review>
Just giving my honest opinion, I hope no one rents from this place. It is very beautiful and has great amenities, but that is about it, for the size and extra cost of small things you pay for and if you want to park your vehicle in a certain area, as well as them not having professional consistent staff, I would not suggest anyone to live here. I do not live here myself but I am frequently about 3 times a week with a client and all i hear is bad things as well as witness things and unprofessional behavior from previous staff. And that also goes for security they have as well, I have seen several guys who seem to not care about there job, and also and older guy who just seems very creepy and he barley ever specks. Also for the holidays they sent out an email saying the residence cant even have a wreath on the door and door mat and also had a time frame of like the first week on January to have there Christmas trees and decor removed. No one pays for your living space but you and for them to say the owners or whoever had a complaint about certain things that is not fair for the tenants because they are the ones living here and shouldn't be told what they can and can not do with there space, as long as things arent being damaged. Also the homeless people who sleep right across the street are a huge problem and cause quit a distraction and does not make it comfortable to even walk around outside sometimes and         very disturbing to some. But overall looks dont make a property and this place will not make you feel at home and after visiting so often I wouldnt want   possible tenants to be unhappy.< /Review>

The worst apartment and management. We moved in back in 2018 and amenities were promised but were extremely late on opening. And by late, I mean months late. Management is slow to respond to emails and phone calls. They are a complete joke when it comes to moving out. We are moving halfway across the country and they would not allow our UPack ReloCube to sit in the loading/unloading dock for the weekend for us to move out, even though I emailed them regarding this weeks before the move. They suggested we use a UHaul and move our things into that and then pack it into our cube at a different location.
Definitely will not live in this building again. The views are nice but not worth the $3000/month price tag for a 1bd 1 bath.</Review>

<text>I was super excited to move in but I couldn't be more disappointed. The building has been open for 6 months now, and the only ammenaties that they've managed to open are the dog park and the gym (which is pretty basic, yet still took them 5 months after opening to complete). If you're really thinking about moving here, you should sign a 12 month lease somewhere else, and when that lease is up they might actually have something else open. The only construction that seems to be making any real progress are the other units that they want to open in order to collect more rent. Don't be fooled when they try to tell you that all the ammenaties will be open soon because they've been telling that same lie to everyone, and every month they have some new excuse as to why nothing is done yet.< /text>< Pics>

If you are reading this review, you're probably considering Park 12 The Collection as your next home. This is my second Greystar apartment, so I was already quite familiar with the quality of a Greystar property. The amenities at Park 12 are stellar. The leasing staff and management are professional, just, and knowledgeable. The common areas are clean, fragrant, and maintained. There are professional grade grills throughout the property for outdoor gatherings with friends and family. A state-of-the-art business center with reliable WIFI, study rooms, and a conference room. To say I am euphoric with my new apartment is an understatement; many thanks to the staff and Greystar for your allegiance to excellence and quality. I am proud to call Park 12 The Collection my home.</review>

<review>JUST MOVED IN and couldn't be happier with apartment, complex and staff! Specifically, Mei who has walked me through the leasing process from the beginning and could not have been more helpful, responsive and kind! The rest of the staff and the security team are equally amazing! Eric in the office, stepped in to help me with questions regarding my apartment when Mei was on a tour and was so very nice. You can really depend on everyone here.  I couldn't be happier and can't wait for the additional amenities and shops to open! Highly recommend Park 12!<//review>< pictures>

STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PROPERTY! SCAM ALERT! Where do I even begin. I moved into Park 12 in October of 2017, I was lured in by their 1 month of free rent, and the fact the building was almost new with no one living in it. As a business owner in downtown and in La Jolla, I wanted something near my business downtown. The building is located in downtown but is right near a large unsafe and unclean homeless district. When I moved in I was promised by the leasing agents and management that the amenities would be ready by end of November. One of the most important amenities being the gym. Since the gym wasn't ready, and factoring in my rent was as high as it was quoted was due to the building offering such nice amenities, I had expected the gym be ready to avoid having to pay for a near by membership. The Gym just recently opened, and after 4 months of paying close to $85/ month for a gym nearby.

IT GETS WORSE!
When I moved in, I talked to leasing about my concerns of being a young woman living downtown alone, and how I needed to have 2 access fobs. I needed one for my dog walker, emergency (given I have some health concerns). They told me they would not issue me any sort of fob after me asking for it several times. They did PROMISE that if I ever needed anyone to come in or there was an emergency that there was 24/7 access into the building and into my unit by security. This was a BIG FAT LIE!

Just about a month ago, when I was coming home after a birthday party, I had my small wallet stolen when I was out, came home and asked for security to let me up to my home. They advised me they couldn't let me into my unit and that they did not have a master key to the units. After 6 hours of waiting in the lobby, and having to sleep in the lobby, a maintenance guy who apparently lived in the building came down and let us up at 6am in the morning. After calling the police, management and working with security all night trying to get to my sick dog (who suffers from separation anxiety) and to be able to sleep in the home I pay a premium for, no one had the key! I had lost sleep and a day of work costing me 1000's of dollars, and a trip to the doctor from a small seizure I had suffered from stress and embarrassment from other residents seeing me laying down in the lobby! Talk about mortifying! Especially after I had asked them to issue me another emergency fob for me to leave in my business or vehicle.

It GETS worse! Even after this incident and emailing management not once penny of severance was offered! They did give me another fob, which they referred to as a "limited access" fob. Shortly after, I had my assistant bring a rent check in February, the building claims they can't locate the check, and threatens me with legal fees because the check being late caused my rent to be delayed.

This Place is a mess! It needs new management. The manager Jessica has no clue what she is doing and has no business as a manager at this high rise. She has treated me with disrespect and did not reach out to me when I was locked out from my house, not even so much as to apologize.

The principal here is DO NOT waste your money giving it to this building. You will be very unhappy and feel like you are a walking $ sign than a valued resident.

On the lighter side, Eric and Mei - Lee are very nice, and would make great management.<//text>

<Text>If you want to pay top dollar for a luxury experience and be treated as a second class citizen then look no further than PARK 12. I have been a resident here since they opened, there were no amenities until very recently but I knew that going in. In the 10 months I’ve lived here I have been traveling for 3 of those months and I actually had to break my lease because of a career move, I bought myself out of the contract and paid all the fees no questions asked, after all I did sign a contract. I had had some not so nice encounters with the leasing manager Amanda Penir but I have been too busy to care enough to write a review, however this weekend was the last straw. I never used the amenities I pay top dollar to have, so I invited some of my friends to the game room to say my goodbyes, Amanda was on duty that day and she sent the security guard to kick my friends and I out of the game room, we were only eating and talking, a group of 8 people including me. When I went to speak to her she said I would have to rent a space if I wanted to have more than 2 guests in the common areas and that I could rent one of the clubhouses for $150 an hour. I had no idea this was the case, I’ve lived in other high end luxury buildings and never have I had issues as long as you are respectful and clean after yourself. I offered to pay the $150 to which she responded “well, do you a check on you?” No, Amanda I don’t walk around with blank checks on my back pocket. I asked to stay in the game room and pay the $150, I had ordered some food and we were already set up, she said no, that I had to move my things or “you can take your friends to your apartment”, thanks Amanda! I didn’t know I had the option of using my apartment. I was so embarrassed I had to ask my friends to leave and on top of it all Amanda sent the security guard to hover around us while we cleaned up, I felt like a criminal, I wasn’t doing anything wrong, I was using the amenities I pay for and never get to use. Amanda’s demeanor and attitude leaves a lot to be desired, she was rude to my guests, she was rude to me and I believe she is in the wrong business. When you are in the hospitality/customer service you have to be pleasant, you have to be nice, no matter what. She could have been more understanding and offered me options, there are always exceptions to the rules, I have been in customer service for 18 years, 8 of those I have been in management positions serving to high end luxury clients. I have lived in other luxury buildings in San Diego and New York City and never have I ever been treated like I was treated by Amanda. On another instance I was having trouble with the media room, I couldn’t connect my laptop to the TV. I went to the front to ask for help, Amanda didn’t even get up from her office, she looked at me and said “just press the button on the wall” I know that if anyone else would have been there instead of her they would have walked me to the room and helped me. That same day I asked her about the wifi because apparently COX bough the lines and you can only have wifi in the common areas with your account. I was never told this when I moved so I moved my ATT&T service with me, I asked if I could get temporary access to the building wifi so I could watch GOT in the media room and she said “you can watch it in your apartment” , again, thanks Amanda! I had no idea I could watch TV in my very own home. I am beyond done with this place and so happy to be moving out. I am filing a formal complaint and already got in touch with the corporate offices in Charleston, South Carolina.< /Text><Rating>1< /Rating><gmap_id>0x80d9535c913e73b3:0x2cb20fed6f4bf68<//gmap_id></record>

< review>
So over priced!!!! The location is in a bad area where the trolley and busses drop off bums.. I've done a tour and none of the apartments have windows unless you have a patio.... which you need to run your AC for air!? Huh.... this is SD the weather is perfect. No need to run my electric bill when it's nice outside 80% of the year...

Look at all the fake reviewers on yelp that have 0 reviews and 0 friends on yelp that are new.... FAKE!!! Beware!!!!! They reported my comment to try to take it down since they know they are putting up the fake reviews.</review>

Apartments are beautiful. But for luxury apartments the customer service sure is lacking. It took 4 tries in order to finally contact a leasing agent. And the leasing agent was a gentleman that was very uninformative and a little rude. Also, I know its not his fault however I find it odd I can't receive any pricing information unless I go into the office. I've worked in property management and have never heard of anything like that. I just feel like a building such as this should have better service and not have someone on the phone that sounds miserable being there.</text>

<name>Rebecca Asnicar<//name><review>I have been living here for about four years now which was pretty good up up until now other than issues with upstairs neighbors that the management does nothing about.  In addition to this I got my lease renewal and here we are in the pandemic which they raised my rent 150 dollars.  When I tried to discuss this issue just got a response back stating that there is no negotiation on the lease.  Really nice management company they only care about the money and now I am paying for the building of the newer phase.  The maintenance people are good.  Another issue is that since they have changed to conservice for water my bill has doubled and they don't do anything about it.  Management here sucks</review>< Pictures>

<text>Great apartment community. It feels like a luxurious resort. Their amenities are super luxurious. Rooms are very spacious. Been staying here for more than 2 years now and the experience has nothing but great since day 1. They have a great gym and its free for the residents. They have 4-5 pool area and it not very crowded except for weekends. The community is at walkable distance from many stores . Its next to I15 so that saves a lot of travelling time. Regal Edward theatre is right around the corner.

Some of the stores within walkable distance are Best Buy, H Mart, Smart & Final, Home Depot, Jamba Juice, Starbucks, CVS , Fedex, Ups, Ross, Ulta Beauty, Old Navy, Barnes & Novel to name a few. They also have dedicated play area for children which include a train ride & Carousel. They have Bowling alley & Table Tennis. You can also use the Barbecue near the pool (First cone first serve basis). Leasing office staff is very friendly & Most of the maintenance issues are resolved within 24-48 hrs. Would highly recommend this place.<//text>< UserId.>

<Date>1619563470201</Date><Rate>2</Rate><text>Interior and amenities are all very nice, unfortunately my only problems with the management team. Showed up for a 2:30 self-guided tour and stood outside for nearly 30 minutes while the person I scheduled with scramble to find some units I could go look at because they had apparently rented out the unit I was supposed to see in the two hours since I had made the appointment. I can totally understand people being a bit behind and flustered or small mistakes BUT one of the houses they gave me the key to was CURRENTLY OCCUPIED by a tenant who was HOME and had NO IDEA why I was there with the key to their house.
Make your own decisions, but I've heard way too many horror stories about nice places being ruined by messy management.<//text>< Pics>

PHASE 3 : The Villas at CMV
Casa Mira View labels itself "LUXURY apartments" while the amenities are unique and plentiful. Daily life at CVM the Villas is far from luxury.

THE GOOD:
Maintenance is prompt and polite. We have had appliance issues in our brand new unit, and maintenance has been quick, effective, and professional. Cleaning crew works hard in attempt to maintain community, they are nice people. Leasing office staff is friendly. Location is convenient to the freeway and shopping.

THE BAD:
Parking: There are not enough spaces for the number of units in community. While you will receive your single or double assigned spaces according to the number of bedrooms in unit, there are only 20 overflow spaces (in a complex of 200 units) if you have a second vehicle in a 1 bedroom unit, you will not have anywhere to park your vehicle. There are 21 "guests" spaces (which are used by residence, not guests, that have not registered their vehicles). This means that 10% of the Villas are able to have a single guest at any given time, which you can imagine is a challenge during holidays. After 4pm there is zero parking outside of assigned space, and half of the 200 units are not occupied so you can anticipate it will only get worse. The leasing office will recommend parking in the overflow of the other phases or parking on the street which is 2 city blocks away from your unit. We often must carry groceries 15 minutes from phase 2 garage to our apartment (LUXURY).

Unit Noise: I have never lived in an apartment with so little noise insulation between units. We literally hear every step, every cabinet close, movie watched and child scream from our neighbor. The "Luxury vinyl plank flooring"  in all units seems nice until you realize that without extra sound insulating material it is a nightmare (OMG SO LUXURY).

Freeway: Being next to a freeway and a "park-and-ride" lot, you will hear every siren, car meet, and general freeway noise at every moment. This property has not installed a sound wall, but a iron fence which does nothing to provide privacy or noise control to the community. The view of the "park-and -ride" lot provides residents an opportunity to see abandoned furniture and trash through their living room window (SMELL THAT LUXURY).

Animal waste: Pet feces and urine is throughout the community. Although there are pet stations in the Villas, there is urine and feces on the floor, on the pillars every day. The cleaning crew is fantastic and cleans it daily, but without enforcement by property, the sight and smell of animal waste is constant (VERY LUXURY woof woof).

Package theft: There are package lockers in the mail room which seems like a great amenity, but because the lockers are shared by all 3 phases they are often full. This results in packages being left in piles on the floor of the mail room or at your front, where in my experience will likely be stolen. Ive had 4 packages stolen, one I caught in the act, while living at the Villas (NOW THATS LUXURY).

The solution to each of these negatives by management is to use curtesy patrol. But it is not the tenants responsibility to repeatedly report ongoing issues that are known and unaddressed by property management. Additionally reporting to curtesy patrol is a pacifier that finds no resolve.</Review>

< Review>
Worse Place to live, too much highway noise. Don't fall for the move in offers. If you are a light sleeper and want a peaceful sleep go for a different apartment. Horrible place and people in the leasing office will be of no use they cant help you in any aspect. They mostly will be cheating you and make you to sign longer term lease with out showing the apartment. The reason they say is, "the apartment you want to see is currently not cleared by the maintenance. we will show the replica." If you are somewhat in a hurry to rent the apartment they will take good advantage of you.

If you want to feel what I say. when you enter the community instead of stopping the car at the leasing office come straight to end and stay outside the car for five minutes. I bet you will feel like jumping into the car and escape from there. These are not luxury apartments, they are just below average.

Bachelors don’t take the apartment at all, just in case if you get married, you won’t get to add your wife to the lease. They won’t let you to make any ethical changes to the lease agreement. May me they don’t let you buy a pet also. I didn’t see such an unfriendly leasing community any where else.

Don't believe the reply's to this review by the apartment people. They are useless. Property managers cant help you in any issues. They are just good actors. I did received call after the review got posted but its just extra waste of time. They will just provide a shoulder to cry and then will dump you like before.

If you want a peaceful life, many options are out there.<//Review>

Mediocre at best, since the amenities are slowly opening back due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From the outside, this place looks like very “luxurious”. But that’s not the case once you’ve been here for a year or so.

Parking garage is a nightmare, basically free for all. Motorcycles revving their engines and driving through setting off car alarms (this happens frequently with loud cars too and always in the morning...) management really can’t do anything about it so I’ve gotten used to it, even the “Police” who sit on their phones seem to not even care.

Security is a joke too, I had filed a report about my car being broken into and nothing has been done, a year later. All they care about is money at this point.

Cleaning staff are very friendly and hard working, sucks to see “management” isn’t the same.</Review>

I have been living here just shy of two months and wanted to wait before giving this review. Similar to other tenants, the noise level at this property is the worst of the other properties I had lived in.

We live here with the upstairs neighbors and they are constantly walking loudly and stomping during the community's quiet hours. I had made numerous complaints by calling security, submitting tickets to their property management website, and even relaying this over to the managers on site.

Even though the managers were nice and seeming apologetic, but they seem to give me the same run-around like with other tenants (keep calling security for them to document the noise and send them video recordings and we will remind the neighbor about noise levels). My honest opinion about that procedure is it simply does not work since if the noise is coming from the back of the apartment, then how are security able to verify the noise just from standing in the hallway?

In addition, the parking structure of this property is not safe especially when most drivers are speeding at corners. Putting parking garage mirrors on all floors will make it a lot safer for drivers to see other drivers.

It is most likely that management cheap out on the noise insulation when they were building this property, but I wish they would make it more of an effect to resolve the issue rather than just playing the waiting game.</text>

My two main problems are noisy neighbors and the majority of the amenities including the gym are almost always closed. It is unfortunate that rent seems to factor in the amenities but then all of the amenities are constantly closed. Regular staff is not helpful and maintenance staff is incompetent.

We lived in Casa Mira for 2 years and overall enjoyed it. For it being our first apartment in California and organizing rental from NC we were blessed that Alessa went above and beyond in helping us. Alessa is the absolute best. We decided to move because we thrive on sunlight. These apartments are not designed to have fresh sunlight. You have to have lamps/lights on all day. Other factors were the extreme speeding in the parking lot and really loud neighbors above us. It was nice being close to a shopping area that you can walk to and being close to 15.<//Text>

Any slight move from above living neighbor, you can hear rattling noise (I feel like all wood in the roof is not well nailed down, its always give cracking noise). This situation I just explained is with good neighbors. Assume that you have crazy people (High likely possible) above you apt, you have signed a lease for 1 year of  vacation next to train track.

<review>Our overall experience here was okay. The surrounding area is great (especially for families), the office staff were alright, and the amenities were really nice. We had no issues with move in/move out processes.

The things that finally grew old were: The upstairs neighbors were extremely loud and there is almost nothing you can do about it. If we complained, they would intentionally stomp or yell all night. We were told to record them, but later told that the only recordings that mattered were the ones made by the courtesy patrol from the hallway. The parking garage is not secure and people race through it. The office staff seemed nice, but frequently forgot I lived there when I would go try to pick up packages or call and would question my residency even when given my apartment number (i.e. are you on the lease? what apartment again, I can't find you). Maintenance requests were handled quickly, but if they entered when you were not home, they would sometimes forget to let you know they had come. When we signed our first year lease, we were told Phase 2 was pet free. Upon moving in, we noticed our upstairs neighbors had a (huge) dog that barked all day/night and maybe 10 neighbors in our 'cove' had dogs that barked *constantly*. Our upstairs neighbors would also sometimes groom their dog and throw clumps of hair over their balcony wall. We wouldn't have had an issue with it if we weren't told 'This phase is pet free'.

After some searching, we were able to find an apartment closer to downtown WITH secure parking and a park view for about the same price we were paying for our cove view.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1592861907808, 'text': 'Dear Jennifer,\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the negative experience you have had at our community.\n\nWe are glad to hear that your move-in and move-out experience at our community went smoothly.

First, when my family moved in, it was the week of Thanksgiving. The staff who we signed with told us that we can move in the day before Thanksgiving. Later, when we went to go drop things off before the move in, they inform us that we are not allowed to move in that day since they are going to be closed. They then proceed to convince us to move in earlier and pay the prorated rent for those days that we CANNOT occupy the space for. Also, they just BARGE into your house with minimal information. Our next door neighbor had their fire sprinklers go off, so they barged into our house "to check for the water leaks." They came into our unit soaked, leaving water pools on our carpet EVERYWHERE and they DO NOT RESPECT your household AT ALL. My family takes our shoes off in the unit, but they came in with their soaked shoes without even asking if it's okay for them to come in with shoes on. Then we get no update, no follow up on the next door. Lastly, their customer service sucks and they don't know how to work promptly. Our A/C in our unit lets out warm air (so much for having air conditioning) and when brought up, they had to have two different people to come out to "check it out". They told us that they are going to quickly check one thing and come back and left the A/C on. They did not return for an hour. We wasted our electricity keeping our A/C that lets out warm air on. They finally return just to tell us that they can't do anything about it and it's going to take another week for ANOTHER guy to come out. They don't update you with ANYTHING. We still do not know if we are going to get our A/C fixed, when it's going to get fixed, etc. I called to ask them what was going on and I got hung up on. This place is absolutely TRASH. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD PLACE, THEN THIS IS NOT IT FOR YOU. DO NOT GET MESMERIZED BY THE EXTERIOR AND SUPER EXTRA AMENITIES.<//Review>< userid>

CMV is like living at a resort!  My experience has been nothing less than exceptional. I made contact with the leasing office through the website, and was called as soon as they opened in the morning. My needs were discussed, and the agent gave me some options that would work based on my desired move-in date. I selected the unit I wanted, did the paperwork over the web, and drove down 6 days later to a well-appointed apartment home ready for me to move in! The grounds are maintained constantly--much like an upscale resort, the maintenance crews are cleaning and fixing constantly. The amenities are top-notch! The pools, the rooftop deck, the bowling alley and game room are all wonderful! My top is to make sure you get a unit that faces away from the freeway. I have been told by a resident who overlooks the freeway that you cannot hear it with the windows closed, but this is San Diego! You want to get fresh air and have your windows open! You also want to be able to sit out on your spacious balcony and enjoy it. You will not enjoy it with the freeway noise.< /text>

This apartments are joke.UNLESS YOU JUST WANT TO RENT A PLACE AND NOT LIVE IN THERE THIS PLACE IS FOR YOU.The build quality of the apartments are horrible in a first place. But it does not stop there, good luck to you if you want to use the facilities or noise complain as other reviewers mentioning it as well.We have a very noisy neighbor that does not understand that someone is living below them so they just jump up and down. THE FUN PART IS THAT MANAGEMENT KEEPS TELLING US TO CALL SECURITY OR RECORD THE NOISE AND STILL NOTHING HAPPENS FOR OVER A YEAR. Bottom line is that don't fall into the fancy words that the management tell you, they don't care about your or the quality of the living in this place, the only thing that they care is MONEY.</Review>

The place is too big and dense and the layout confusing. But i do have a thing for urban development and the place is kinda cool too, in other ways. Perhaps imagine the whole place as one tower laid out similar to a hotel downtown.

By the following Monday morning, I got a call from the property manager - Elsa who was extremely nice, apologetic for the situation, and resolved the issue immediately. Everyone makes mistakes, CMV corrected theirs about as efficiently as possible and I give them full credit for that. I appreciate their efforts and will say that this is a great place to live.

Not at all happy with the billing setup of Casa Mira View. I am trying to set up online auto pay so that you guys can be guaranteed you'll be payed on time in the full amount and you couldn't make it more difficult. I was told I have to wait 45 days to get a utility bill in order to locate my account number to activate auto pay? Are you kidding? I am a full fledged resident who has already paid thousands of dollars in rent/security deposit and you don't have an account number for me and have to wait for a utility bill to come through for me to locate it? It's the 21st century. If you want your money, you need to figure this out. I am paying too much to be inconvenienced like this.

The place itself is beautiful and I have had no problems with the staff. But this is too important of a misfire on your administrative side to give more than two stars. Figure it out.</Text>< Pictures>

<time>1583732224671</time><rate>1< /rate><text>I lived there for 15 months and give a 1 because of the extremely poor experience I had with the management at Casa Mira View. I was told lies many times by multiple people at the office. Before I signed the contract, the leasing office manager, Ernest, and multiple people including Elisa and Sara told me that Phase 2 apartments are pet free. That was a total LIE. There are dogs all over Phase 2 and 1. You hear them bark day and night. The management also lied to me once saying that the box I had ordered was not delivered at their office and when I insisted that I had the delivery notification then they gave me the box. Do NOT TRUST what they tell you before you sign the contract. Make sure you get everything in writing, before you sign. They also told me I could add my partner to the lease after I move in, but when I went to add his name they refused to do it. Also, the apartments are TOO DARK. There is literally No Natural Light. Even in a sunny day you will have to have all lights on. You can never keep your windows open since building are in front of each other and neighbors have direct view into your apartment. If you have an expensive car, you want to stay away. I observed 3 times when tires were stolen from BMWs and a Mercedes and the cars were sitting on rocks. The maintenance people are nice. Amenities and pool area are nice and clean. You also hear the highway noise which is super annoying. I DO NOT Recommend this place.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Brandon C. has been vital for our cross-country move. He was very thorough through the entire proces-- from the application, to picking a unit, to the actual move-in date. He was responsive, courteous, and overall a great asset to your team! If there are any rewards or recognition, he is well deserving of it.
Thank you, Brandon!

CMV is everything we've hoped for in a place. Especially if you have kids. The only downside is the amenity closures bcoz if covid, but can't wait to fully experience the rest of it. We love our new HOME.< /Review><Time>1595317614985<//Time>< rating>

Pain Points:
Adding/Removing someone from a lease is a nightmare and for no reason. The company is ridiculous in this area.
Dealing with the leasing office can be frustrating, and i think that mostly stems from the fact that the leasing office is a rotating door of who works there. The company shuffles people around to different complexes it owns, leaving me feeling like im never dealing with someone who actually understands what is going on.

That's it. That's all i have for negative issues. Otherwise, living here has been the best thing ever. The space is incredible, maintenance is AMAZING. Fast, efficient, nice ALWAYS. Never a bad experience. You are going to be hard-pressed to find a better living situation for the price.

It's a gorgeous place and we feel safe living here. All of the workers here are super attentive, caring, and extremely kind. I plan on moving to the VIP building. I cannot wait until the building is ready for my family and I to move into. I love our locations since there are a bunch of stores and restaurants nearby.

A very loud alarm has been going off in the hallway of our building almost EVERY day. This alarm has been going off for 2 months and management has yet to fix the issue! I have to call almost every day to have maintenance come and temporarily turn off the alarm. Property management keeps saying “we’re working on the issue”..: yeah right it does not take 2 months to fix a faulty alarm. Don’t move here. You can hear the alarm from inside the apartment even with all the windows and doors closed.</Text>

The only apartment complex in the middle of a pandemic that raises their tenants rent amount.   Truly this place is all about their $$ and bottom line.   Take notice of their review scores.   This place is ridiculous and obviously cares very little for it's  tenants during a national crisis.   RENTERS BEWARE!< /Text>

I can’t wait for my lease to be done here so I can move out . I don’t even know where to start with what’s wrong . When we moved it our dishwasher and refrigerator was broken and took about 8 service calls to get them to actually fix it. People smoke everywhere and they claim this is a smoke free place . People are loud and they never do anything about it. They sold us on living here by saying all of the amenities were included in our rent and when everything started with Covid-19 they shut everything down (even though everything was basically shut down for months before for “maintenance” lol what a joke !) I asked them if they would lower rent since everything is closed and they sent me back an email basically saying the amenities were a privilege and not a right and they would not be helping us out. They haven’t even said anything about Covid-19 . This place is a joke. Also beware of the broken elevator, you better start practicing walking up 5 flights of stairs before you move in. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT ANYTHING BUT MONEY . THEY DONT EVEN RESPOND TO ME WHEN I HAVE AN ISSUE .< /Review>

It is our goal to restore the amenities to normal hours as soon as we can. We will be sure to keep you informed on a re-opening date.\n\nWe would like to invite you to please call our leasing office so we may address these issues and concerns to determine the proper solution.

Security always drives around and checks on people walking around the complex. My family and I love living here because we feel safe, cared for, and the amenities are wonderful. I go to the gym a lot and I always see female workers going in the restrooms cleaning. We're going to extend our lease because we literally have everything we need here and more. Thank you to all of the staff, office workers, and the maintenance team for always taking care of us and the rest of the residence here. People who write negative and bad reviews are a bit dramatic. We've always received assistance when we've asked for it. Thanks Casa Mira View! :)</Review><name>Liliana Ghukasyan< /name>< Date>

<Review>Moved here about a month ago and lovin it so far! The maintenance staff is great, helpful, friendly, timely and gets the job done! Amenities are awesome and love the gym. Only complaint; the garage is awful. People drive WAY TOO FAST, there are no cameras to monitor drivers and traffic goes in all directions. Almost had three head on collisions due to drivers speeding and coming around corners all kinds a wreck less. For what we pay, there should be a better system implemented. Only way to reprimand those drivers is if you get their license plate. I ain’t about to turn around and follow them to their spot. Other than the garage, no complaints. 👌🏽</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>My wife and I have lived here going on 2 years now.  All in all we think this is a wonderful place to live. Management has always been very helpful with any concerns we bring to their attention.

The speeding in the garage has sometimes been an issue but that's of no fault of management.

While I do miss the amenities such as the bowling alley etc ..I totally understand, out of the abundance of caution, why they must be close.

My only gripe (if you want to call it that) is the very 'thin walls' especially if you have noisy neighbours living above you as we do.. You can definitely hear every footstep and every door slamming shut.

But again, this is a beautiful community.  Management always prompt to help you.

i hate writing reviews especially bad reviews.... but i don't have any option but to give 1 star (0 star if google allows it)..... only because of the management people in leasing office......we (me and my wife) recently moved to this apartment (just a month ago)...... we booked this apartment online as we moved from Oregon..... But since we moved in, we have been constantly hearing the people living upstairs stamping a lot almost every day.   So we called the leasing office and asked for their help. They asked me to call the dispatch. we called dispatch several times. Dispatch lodged the complaint and contacted the people living upstair. but after few days of silence, we started to hear again the stamping noise which is really frustrating.....after that the dispatch people told us to contact back again the leasing office so that they can talk to the people directly..... when i called the leasing office, they told me to record a noise video and send to them...... i mailed them the noise video and even my wife personally went to the leasing office to show them...... The manager told us that they will intervene and will talk to these people living upstairs. But frankly nothing has been done and we still hear the same noise throughout the day...... even now i can hear the noise while writing this review..... not sure when these leasing office people will help us....... i have lived in many apartments but never experienced this kind of management. Hopefully they will do something.</Text>

<rating>1< /rating><review>Pros: Appealing to the eye, nice amenities, apartment size is decent for the area.

Cons: Loss of sleep. Car alarms consistently go off from cars with loud exhausts and neighbors that blast music all night, the pools are constantly closed and there is no security in the parking garage or hallways. Anyone can walk up to your front door or car.

This community is nice for the area. However, I would consider having somewhere you can stay on occasion to get more than 4 hours of sleep at night.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I was considering living here having just moved from Austin, Texas to San Diego, CA.  I have looked everywhere for places to live in the Mira Mesa area since my work is located here.  When I went onto Casa Mira View's website, I was happily amazed by the amount of amenities they have available for children and since I have a 2 1/2 year old grandson, I decided this was the place I wanted to live. Just before I started to complete the online application, I decided to come and look at the reviews for Casa Mira View.  I was completely disgusted by the reviews, both on Google and on Yelp, & how there are consistent complaints for the SAME issues for over a year now since they practically opened.  There are constant responses from Management apologizing over and over; however, the issues, however big, still remain.  THAT is a major concern for a new development requiring greater than $2k/month for a simple 1 BR apartment.  And, when you read the same complaints over and over from several different current and past residents, it's obvious these issues are very real and they haven't done a damn thing to fix them.  As someone who has been in the service industry for more than 20 years, I find this utterly depressing and despicable.  I'm very happy there are reviews to read because had I not read them, I would be utterly miserable and breaking a lease that would gravely affect my credit even though they are the culprits.  Thank you for all of the fair warnings, reviewers.  Management, get off you A*S and make these changes.  Stop apologizing and FIX THE PROBLEMS!  This is unacceptable for a new community.  Unbelievable...You should be ashamed.</text>< Pictures>

EDIT: After speaking with the property, they have promptly addressed this issue and I have changed my rating due to this.  Below is my original post with 2 stars.

Outdoor gym should have limited hours.  It's inconsiderate to let people exercise right outside your bedroom at 6 am until 10 pm (and yes, people do this).  Very noisy, and personal trainers take their clients out there to exercise at 6 am and talk loudly/use loud equipment (especially the ropes).< /Review>

<Review>I’ll give the Casa Mira View three stars cause of the size of my unit it’s nice size apartment, management is not bad like some have said. But let’s talk about what I don’t like first the walls are paper thin no instillation cold even with the heat on, the apartments are stacked one on top of another and you can here it all from your neighbors. I’m just walking like normal living my life not doing jumping jacks and the people below me has complained about the Noise but that’s another story. The parking structure is terrible people drive like crazy through there I hate the parking structure, once I move from here a parking structures is going to be a non starter. It is pet friendly so that’s cool but I’m not to happy with this apartment complex, unfortunately I might have to sign a new lease cause I don’t have enough time to look for something else. ⭐️⭐️⭐️< /Review>< Pics>

<review>I would give 0 star if the system allows me. Worst apartment management ever! List of failures:

1. Crazy people driving loudly at midnight in parking structure, triggering other cars alarm and it will go on for half an hour. Reported multiple times but no one takes action.
2. Package delivered to leasing office it too hard to get. They open at 9:30am and close at 5pm. You need to either late for work or leave early to get the package. Sooo inconvenience.
3. No reservation for elevator while moving in and out. Triple the time to move up and down. Security trying to talk some BS about the policy not helping the movers
4. Stupid fees for cleaning and other items

This list can go on and on. Main point is, no one cares about tenants well being. Management people just follow their rules trying not to make mistake and put on fake smile. Awful experience. Don't get fooled by their pools and gym. At end of the day, it's people you are living with. Not to mention neighbors will laugh loudly at 2am or let their dogs bark for half an hour...<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1562102089676, 'text': 'Dear Tiancheng T.,\nThank you for your feedback.

<Review>Parking garage is awful and they WON'T do anything about it! Been living here not even two months yet and have complained about the lack of security in the parking lot and how they take no action to help. Almost got into 3 head on collisions in the lot due to people driving recklessly and paying no mind to children or others walking in the parking lot. Wrote a review about this a while ago and got an automated reply not addressing a DAMN thing about it! I was even stalked in the parking lot and complained about it and they did absolutely nothing! The tickets they write aren't even tickets, pointless. The parking lot has been a complaint about CMV since this place opened and still, they do nothing.
Other than that, its a nice place to live and amenities are great. Kompact is great and so helpful and so is one of the lead maintenance men, Josue. If it weren't for them, not sure I'd have more positive things to say.< /Review><user_name>Christina Bray</user_name>< Rate>

This really is a nice place to live. The staff has been nice, pleasant and professional during my encounters.  The location is awesome  in relation to other places that I frequent.  The worst part about living here is that people seem to have no filters or concerns for other neighbors.  The noise from above and below has been somewhat of a nightmare. In most cases from sun up to sun down or when ever they feel like doing their thins. Warnings and security seems to not work or carry zero weight. If you're looking for a beautiful place to live, this is the place for you. If you're looking for peace, to sleep in on your days off, to go to bed early, have a nice quiet night with friends or a date over, watch TV, ect... ,  you may not find that here.   I think that there should be more general announcements concerning these issues.  Nothing is perfect, but we all should make an effort to be respectful of others.</Text>

This is not an apartment complex you should view, stay away. Living here is a huge health risk due to terrible sanitation, lack of disposal and diseased pet facilities. To make things worse the lack of support from Garden Community staff is undeniably poor. Below are the facts, with pictures to back them up!

There is no dog park. Instead pet trash facilities are allowed to overflow for days at a time. There is some fake turf on the top floor parking lot, but it is a breeding ground for diseases with fecal matter not cleaned up by irresponsible owners.

Residents constantly leave large furniture (couches, beds, tables, chairs, dressers) blocking entrance to the trash room, and often leave bags of trash on the floor instead of placing down the garbage chute, which leads to rotten smells throughout. This has been allowed to go on for years.

The elevators often break and remain out of use for weeks at a time, so you’ll get plenty fit taking the stairs all the time.

The office hours are only 9:30am to 5:00pm, meaning if you want to collect a package or make any inquiry you’ll have to do so only during your workday. The office (plus gym & amenities) also close frequently for staff training, any holiday or any random reason, which seems to occur almost every week.

You will hear all of your neighbors and their animals (yapping dogs, squawking parrots etc) . This community is also made up of some inconsiderate people that will have balcony parties until early hours, which echoes and reverberates around the unique courtyard design (between every building here). You hear everything.

The parking structure is guaranteed to drive every resident crazy, as everyone I speak too has expressed. There is no system, it’s a multidirectional, narrow free-for-all, laden with over 25 speed bumps to ruin your car’s suspension and have you spend hundreds extra on new tires, not to mention the extra fuel consumption in such elaborate maneuvers. The speed limit is 5 mph (which means it takes over 9 minutes to get from the entrance to the top, so prepare to waste a lot of time in here). Also, most cars have dents, scratches and damage as very few residents here respect anyone’s vehicles and seemingly cannot drive. Truly terrible.

Moving in and out is disastrous as there are no service elevators, and while you’re told you can reserve one, this never is allowed. If you’re crazy enough to live here, it will take you an entire week to move in.

Expect to have to take time off work throughout the year, so the maintenance team can conduct random assessments and upgrades to your home. I had to take a total of 8 days vacation last year just to make sure I could be home for them to inspect my sprinklers (it took 20 minutes) and change the locks (an hour). I asked for a rent reduction or even waived pet rent for that month and was met with rude staff telling me “No way”.

The bowling lanes are frequently out of service, the pools are regularly closed for maintenance and when they are open the ‘relaxing’ hot tub is overrun by several small children (Yes, even until 10pm).

Some (not all) of the pet owners in this complex have no idea how to train their animals, so there is dog urine and fecal matter staining the hallways and aggressive dogs running around, some off leash. I was told by my neighbor that in 2018 one dog killed another in a vicious attack!

The annual increase in rent this year (2019) is 8%. That is an insane increase in what is a competitive market (which typically raises rates 1-3% annually).

If you’re looking to rent I would highly recommended nearby SoFi Westview or SoFi Highlands, and also Sorrento Terrace not far away. Anything and anywhere but this poorly operated, dangerous and extremely rude complex. Stay away!</Text>< Pics>

I had been living in that place from year 2014-2016, moving from the left wing building to the right wing building but I'm glad I got out of that place.

Here's what you need to know before signing the lease.
1. Your deposit will not be refund, whatsoever. It doesn't matter how good you clean up the place, they will charge literally everything from carpet, paint, cleaning, etc. and if you don't clean, they will charge you extra.
If you have to move out before the contract leasing ended, not even you don't get deposit back, you also have to pay extra for moving out early.

2. If you move to another building, or another room, you have to pay the extra charges for not moving out on time, even your new room is not ready to move in (not your fault) but you still have to pay.

3. Realistically, you will live in the community of cholos, gang, drug dealers, car racers, low income section 8 checks receiver, shooting in the parking lots. You would wonder,  how could this thing happen? You've paid  SKY ROCKET rent!? This place will be full of surprise.

4. If you stay in 2 beds room or 3 bed room, you will accommodate only 1 lot of parking spot. If you have more than 2 cars, you have to wish yourself a luck to park in guest spot or on the street ( way outside of the gate ).

5. Your neighbors will be so loud, especially the one on top of you. Thanks to thin wall and sub-leasing people next to you since the rent is too high. The benefit of thin wall, you will hear everything next door talks or listen to music. This place allow dogs, so enjoy the howls in the middle of the night since most ppl keeps their dog outside at the patio.

6. Your swimming pool will filled up with all kinds of people. If you like " melting pot racial ", you definitely enjoy this place ( not the classy one like Vegas but you'll get the idea).

7. Gym is free, but you will see a lot of people from outside, get in and out. They will occupy all equipments and weights, the only way you get to exercise is, getting a membership at LA fitness or 24 hours fitness somewhere else.</Review>

Amazing apartment complex. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I love this place because of the beautiful grounds and amenities that are provided to the tenants. I especially love the bowling alley along with the sense of belonging this complex creates to welcome every resident and feel like you're part of a great community. If you're new to the area or looking for a new place to live this should definitely be one of your first stops!</text>

<Review>Looks good from outside, but terrible when living inside. Here are some reasons:
1-outrageous lease terms; you can never end your lease early by paying a fine,  you cannot transfer it to someone else. so If you need to move out early for a reason, you must first move out and keep paying rent until they find a new tenant with a new rate. Good luck with that since they always have many vacant units.
2-expensive; My 1 bedroom apartment is one of the most expensive in the area, yet rent is being raised by another 4% for the next year. Still many low income people live here, maybe through affordable housing benefits, so it is not a luxury complex neither.
3-noisy: loud cars with modified exhaust in the parking, and they trigger other cars alarm all the time. it wakes us up as early as 5am. (management could easily do something about it). Not to mention your neighbors sound system or pets. Highway and boulevard noise;  It's a mess.
4-slow and dumb elevators;  huge parking structure; just getting to the ground level on foot or by car is a hassle.
5-pet free phase 2 is not really pet free.

Overall it is a crowded high density complex, and overpriced, yet  management is most arrogant I have seen.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< Review>
We're to start, first off I lived here in the new building phase 2 for over a year and dealt with issues a few months after moving in. They had a loud noise from inside our bedroom wall with the pipes and that literally never got fixed. Constant them ripping our wall open and leaving it open and never fixed. We paid $1900 a month for constant issues. Then there so called customer service manager alondra is the worst customer service manager I've ever dealt with in my life. She literally did absolute nothing to help us out or even cared to try all she would do was say sorry and nothing I can do to help us, like seriously we pay that much money and your telling me we have to deal with issues in our apartment since you can't have it built right the first time. And then our lease came up for renewal and we had the option to renew or go month to month. So we chose month to month to figure out what we wanted to do. Then out of nowhere for no reason we get a letter saying we have to move out and wouldn't give us a reason as to why. Worse place ever. Do yourself a favor and live anywhere else but here. I wish I could leave pictures that I've taken and the emails they sent me showing them doing nothing at all. And even the recording of the sound I showed them proving it wasn't a lie. Feel free anyone to reach me and I can show you myself so you don't make the mistake I did by living here.<//Review>

I am a current resident at Casa Mira View. Some reasons why i rated this place 1 star is because the pool is always closed and is rarely open. Every time it reopens, there is nothing changed and so it is a big mystery about what they are doing. Like come on, if your gonna keep the pool close about everyday you got to at least lower the rent for everyone who lives here because like who would want to pay lots of money for a closed pool. Even though there are other pools, it never gets sun. The playground that is being built will definitely get no sun because it is blocked by a building and a freeway wall and that leads to no sun. Also, the playground seems a bit small for about hundreds of children that live in these apartments. Something good about this place is that the mail room smells delightful. I hope in the future the pool will be open more often and there will be lots of playgrounds.<//text>

Zero Stars should be an option. This place is a dump! only built in the last year and it’s already falling apart. It smells like garbage everywhere you go. The leasing staff are lazy and incompetent. PLEASE!! don’t waste your money here. This kind of inner city / third world living doesn’t belong in San Diego. you could make a mortgage payment for what they overcharge in rent. Oh...and add an extra 20 minutes to your commute just for getting in and out of the overcrowded parking structure.< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>So far I like everything about Casa Mira View. My apartment is nice and spacious, no neighbors noise...well...I live in the fifth floor so that helps.The facilities are amazing. I guess that is their selling point but I really appreciate some events that they provide, like next week there will be some live music in the club house.
In relation to services; I had to call maintenance a few times and they responded really quick. I was impressed.  I read some reviews complaining about the people who work in the leasing office. I  experienced none. Before renting my apartment I went there several times to look at my options and everyone I dealt with were really nice and professional. Three days before moving I had a change of mind and asked to change apartments. I no longer wanted the one closer to he freeway. I thought they would give me a hard time for the last minute change, but no, they were very accommodating and didn't' make me feel bad at all. I give 5 starts to the apartment complex as well as to Daniel and Christina from the leasing office<//Text>< userid>

<review>I will give only ZERO star. Please DONT rent this apartment. Below are the reasons, read it carefully..
1. This management is cheating the people. Sucks all our penny..
2. There is NO LEASE BREAKAGE at all..
3. Incase of move out before lease expiry, renters has to pay all the remaining lease term till their lease completion...
4. If you decided to move out after lease term, at-least be prepared to have 1 month rent for cleaning charge.
5. During lease signing, at-least need to sign 30 to 40 pages in 100 pages document. So many hidden charges during final move out.

Hope my review helps some people.<//review><Time>1549688975138< /Time>< pictures>

<Review>Our first year was great living here. Unfortunately, since we re-leased in August, the community has not been the same. The staff seems to be more concerned will filling vacancies than leasing to decent people. Our down stairs neighbors play really loud music until 2am and then start again at 7am. Closing our windows only amplifies the sound. My bedroom floor vibrates from how loud the base is. We have complained on several occasions but no one does anything about it. The leasing office will tell you to call the curtesy patrol. This patrol may stop by and our neighbor may stop but it will start up again around with in an hour. We have been through this exercise at least 6 times and since there are no consequences, the message to everyone exposed to the excessively loud music, is to just put up with it. Our apartment is in the U-shape portion with our windows facing more neighbors. People will just leave their dogs in the patio to bark all day. There is a turn around lane in the middle of the U-shape which people use to move in and just park. Parked cars will also blast music. Closing your windows, does help with sound attenuation.
In short, the community may seem nice and it does have lots of amenities but if you have a problem with your neighbors, don't expect any help from the employees here.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1512670620927, 'text': 'Dear Tamara,  Thank you for providing us with your feedback.

I have had one of the best experience living in Casa Mira View. Personally, I haven’t had one problem living in casa mira. I met good people who are still my friends now, it’s dog friendly for the most part (some neighbors don’t like dogs), and they have really nice amenities. Don’t sleep on their gym! It’s one of the best gyms I’ve been to that isn’t a paid membership kind of gym. Also the people in the leasing office are amazing. I remember moving in, they helped me through the process and moving out, they were even better. I could not move out by the move out date, not only were they understanding but they were so cool about extending the lease a couple of days until I had everything set. If I wanted to stay in an apartment I would’ve renewed the lease. I would 100% recommend casa mira to friends and family.<//Text>

I know it is long but please read the full review. WORST complex we have ever lived in. I am not one to leave reviews or read them because I like to judge for myself, but I most certainly will leave one for this complex with a list:

1. Leasing agents are nasty. If they do not understand what you are talking about or are confused they give you attitude and the property manager is no better. I had a leasing agent almost cause an actual verbal argument with me in the office because she could understand what I was talking about with an ESA and got frustrated to the point of taking it out on me.

2. Speaking of ESA's, they are fully aware that people falsify Service Dogs, ESA's, AND that people don't register their dogs and 99.9% of these dogs are on the "restricted/aggressive" breed list. We moved in with one dog, paid the $500 pet deposit and $50 pet rent every month. We asked the leasing agent at the time if we got another dog would we pay another deposit or just an extra pet rent, she told us just another pet rent that's all since we already paid the initial deposit. We then called a few months ago (before getting our second dog) to clarify that was still in fact the rule and the agent replied correct. We went to register our new dog at the complex and was denied because we would not pay the extra $500 since that was not stated to us, ALSO NOT IN OUR LEASE!!!! It states in our lease that a deposit of $500 will be made and additional $50 per month per dog following. NOWHERE in the lease does it state that there is an extra $500 deposit. We spoke to the assistant property manager and property manager, which they couldn't assure us enough that this was the policy and "we understand where the confusion is because its not in your lease, but you won't find an apartment here with more than one dog without a $1,000 deposit". We argued back and forth, considering their staff wasn't trained on the proper procedures as well which left us sitting ducks. I replied to the property manager,  "that's fine, I'll just register him as an ESA like everyone else does here". The property manager KNOWING IM FALSIFYING THE ESA willing said, "okay would you like the paperwork to fill that out?".

3. All these "rules" they put in your lease and CONSTANTLY send out emails about ARE NEVER ENFORCED. We have called NUMEROUS times about people with one apartment spot just rotating their cars with the permit spot next to them every couple days, or week/weeks, and guess what? NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE ABOUT IT. Also almost gone ran over a few times in the parking lot from aggressive drivers and people speeding, and guess where the "security guards" are? Sitting in their golf cart somewhere on their damn phones. And don't even think about approaching any of them, I barely got spoken back to by two different guards with just nasty nasty attitudes.

4. Speaking of them constantly sending emails about rules, they're constantly making "new rules" or adding little bits onto the ones you signed on your lease. It's literally like a prison living here, there are restrictions on EVERYTHING. Considering we're paying $2,000 a month for a one bedroom we shouldn't have to feel like a dog in a cage. Sure, the amenities are nice and the apartments are nice but they are NOT WORTH IT.

5. When we first moved in also, our washer broke twice. On top of the fact that our carpets weren't changed or cleaned. We had the Kirby vacuum guy come by the day we moved in to test the vacuum on the carpets, the bag was FILLED with dirt and hair. You could literally see the color difference in the carpet from where he vacuumed to where he didn't. So I would really like to see them try to charge us for it when we leave.

6. Final thought, if you are considering renting from here. DO NOT DO IT. Go somewhere else!!! Go somewhere with less restrictions and hopefully better people in the office. If I had the time to bring them to court for the ESA incident with trying to make us pay an extra deposit and it not being in our lease, I WOULD IN A HEART BEAT.< /text>

We moved in late December and we love it here. Like every apartment, they have their ups and downs, but honestly there are much more ups here than what I have experienced with the numerous apartments we've lived in previously. First off, you get some outdoor space as the balconies are HUGE which is a big plus for me. Maintenance is great, very professional. The staff is pretty good, I've even met with the director, Wendy, and she is AWESOME and is very down to earth and helpful. The size of our apartment is HUGE compared to what we were able to find in the area for our price point, although the rent seems high, they are actually very reasonable considering the square footage you get. Yes the speed bumps are annoying as all get out, but people DO speed in the parking garage like they are on the freakin' freeway! The only other real con is my neighbors upstairs are likely running a gym or something because they are the loudest neighbors I've ever had in my life, but that's not the apartment's fault. We plan on living here until we are ready to buy a place and we'll be sure to miss living here with all of its amazing amenities (although the sooner we can get some community grills on the property, the better ;-)). Also, I did want to add that the place is seriously energy efficient; the utilities are REALLY low. I lived in a place half the size of this place and the electricity bill was higher there than what I pay here, and I am not afraid to use the A/C; the water is about the same as the place I lived in previously that was half the size, still great.<//text>

<Text>The apartments are very nice & so are the amenities, but my husband and I will not be signing the lease when this one is up. When you finally have a day off to relax on a holiday all the amenities are shut down and you can't use them. It's very irritating, we pay to be able to use them and then when we have a day and time to use them, we can't because everything is closed. The speed bumps are great, but they are all in random spots. None are in the turns when going up the parking deck or coming down and I can't tell you the amount of times I've almost been hit around the turns because people going so fast and not caring. Again, the place is very nice and the staff is friendly but I don't pay to not get to use the amenities on days that I can finally sit and relax with my husband.</Text></record></dataset><record>

There are speed bumps every 10 feet because your neighbors will try to drive 50 mph in the garage. If you do go the speed limit you will have someone tailgating you so close you will think you are towing their car. In addition to that having tandem parking is horrible, you always have to coordinate on who is parking where.

The rental office staff are good and I never had an issue with them or timeliness.</text>< Pics>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>At first I thought the place was great. The amenities are a big selling point.

However, I've found the leasing staff to be completely incompetent in the past 6 months. When I first signed the lease with my roommates, I told them I would be bringing my emotional support animal. They had me sign a paper regarding the ESA policies prior to moving in. I had all the documentation signed and turned into them a month before the lease began and thought that was that. Well, 5 months in they start saying that they need me to sign it again. So I do and send it to them. Then, they claim I didn't send it and are starting to threaten a lease violation. Turns out they had lost the email. My own copy of the email, which I forwarded to them, showed very clearly I had sent them the file the day that they had asked. Then, months later, they claim the paperwork STILL wasn't complete. Why? Because I had listed my previous address from A MONTH BEFORE THE LEASE as my address when I had turned in the paperwork prior to move in. They wanted the address I would move into once I started the lease. Why they didn't tell me that 8 months prior when I initially turned in the paperwork is beyond me.

There was also the incident where I was being cyberstalked, harassed, and threatened to the point where I no longer felt safe living at the apartment. I went to the leasing office and explained the situation. Despite the threat to my safety, they said there was no way they could release me from the lease, even if I found a replacement. To make matters worse, the leasing office shared this private information with one of my roommates via email when she mistakenly sent a follow-up email to her instead of me.

I wasn't going to continue living in a place where I felt my safety was in jeopardy, so my roommates agreed to handle rent and I moved out. I told the leasing office I was no longer living there and asked for them to note it in the file and also to stop contacting me regarding the apartment, given I was no longer living there. Since I was the one who mainly interacted with the leasing office when initially getting the apartment for my group, the leasing office often used me as the primary contact and wanted me to pass information along to my roommates. The leasing office said they still had to contact me, since I was on the lease, but that they would note to contact me last.

That didn't happen. Got an email addressed solely to me from the leasing office asking if I still wanted additional parking spaces for the apartment. Why would I care about additional parking spaces for an apartment I don't even live at?

I don't normally write reviews on Google, but the complete disorganization and incompetency of the leasing office these past 8 months drove me to this point. It's not that hard to actually check paperwork or keep track of it. It's not that hard to contact the correct individual on the lease in regards to their personal situations. It's not that hard to read the apartment file and see that I'm no longer the primary contact on the lease. I'm so done with this place and can't wait for my lease to be over so I will never have to deal with this organization again.

That being said, the maintenance staff is prompt and nice. Apartments themselves are nice and spacious. Good insulation in terms of heat and sound. Again, the amenities are great. However, parking. Parking is a b. You only get one car per bedroom you rent. So, if you're sharing a 1 bedroom with someone, only one of you get a parking spot. If you're sharing a 2 bedroom, you only get two parking spots. Parking without an assigned spot is impossible. Guest spots are constantly filled by guests or residents without enough parking spaces. So if you want to host someone at your new swanky apartment, maybe bring them to the hot tub...don't bother. They'll drive to you only to not be able to find a guest spot on the garage. Street parking isn't easy either and it can be a long walk.

If you're willing to pay their pricetag, do yourself a favor and get a nicer place somewhere nearby.</Review>< name>

< Review>
I am a current resident at Casa Mira View. I moved in in December of 2017. Since I moved in with my wife and 3 yr old daughter we have had nothing but problems.  About two weeks after moving in, my wife and I went on a trip for the weekend.  When we came home Sunday evening our downstairs neighbor started banging on our floor. She then came and knocked on our door and started to yell and threaten to call the police and security on my wife and I for the noise. Stating that since we moved in it sounded like a train.  Since that night it has been nothing but complaint after complaint. We got a puppy and it weighs roughly 15 lbs. We get daily complaints about noise simply because my daughter and my puppy play in our apartment.  The daily harrassment has resulted in the leasing office calling us to inform us "that we need to be mindful of the noise and that we really need to keep it down." Shy of locking my child and puppy to the floor there really isn't anything else that can be done.  Am I supposed to tell my daughter that she has to sit still and cannot play in our apartment? Am I supposed to pin my 6 month old puppy to the ground so he doesn't run around and play in our apartment? The apartment complex has made my wife and I feel like we are being singled out and harrassed because our apartment isn't dead silent and the downstairs neighbor doesn't like it.  We don't complain about the stomping from upstairs at all hours of the day. We don't complain about the barking in the courtyard at 2am. We don't do these things because we understand that we live in an apartment complex and there is going to be noise at random times.  I was on deployment when my wife was apartment hunting.  She fell in love with Casa Mira View. It took just over a month for us both to no longer want to live at Casa Mira View. It has been nothing but downhill since we moved in. Unless you plan on sitting still not making a sound the entire time you are in your apartment or just aren't going to be staying in your apartment I DO NOT recommend Casa Mira View to ANYONE. It truly isn't worth the hassle and stress and unhappiness or the money. Do not move in here. Please for your own sanity do not.<//Review>

I personally had experienced nothing but good and kindness from the leasing office so far. Everyone who I worked with for my issues and concerns helped me quite a bit in a very responsive way! The ladies to great you at the front desk at the leasing office are very friendly and nice. Very warm. I have absolutely no complaints, and certainly no shallow complaints such as the bumps in the parking lot structure going to the fifth floor type a thing...

You don't like the bumps get an apartment on the first floor.. It is your decision, nobody made you sign it. When signing a lease, make sure to do your own walk-around and think-about on all possible future issues you might have with the new place BEFORE signing.

I am coming from LA. And reading these comments here about Casa Mira View make me laugh. If you are coming from LA and live in a similar complex over there, you would have so much more complaints- TRUST ME. Someone here said "regulations." Every new condo apartments complex of such size anywhere else outside of SD will have regulations, and issues here and there, especially when it goes under construction as they lease. It's just the way it is. People expect to be handed everything on a silver plate because they pay the rent therefore they're obligated. For the most part, they are right.. but majority of the time when it pertains to these shallow comments here - they are certainly not.

I have only been living here for 4-5 months now but I'll tell you what, no complaints on my part.

So far so good.

< Review>
Stay away from this apartment complex for the following reasons:
1)	Management: Oh manager! manager do not even know how to write the management word correctly, I bet manager burly have high school diploma! This person does not know ANYTHING ABOUT MANAGEMENT! literally can not manage 5 people, so do not expect this person to manage this huge apartment complex!
2)	LEASING OFFICE WORKING HOURS IS FROM 10 TO 4! So, if you are working during week days, and you have an issue and need to talk to them, you will not be able to go to leasing office. Phone call? Good luck! They do not give a sh…t to phone calls from residences.
3)	I am leaving in the brand-new apartment and ants are everywhere!!!! Leasing office did not give a sh…t to this issue and I had to pay it myself. So be ready, you must pay for any issues yourself.
4)	OMG. Parking!! This is the most difunctional parking I have ever seen in my life!!
5)	Please respect yourself and stay away from complex and dysfunctional management.<//Review>

The apartments and amenities are nice and all but the office seriously does not care about their residents. Its ridiculously noisy and the "courtesy patrol" is basically useless. My upstairs neighbors are extremely loud at all hours and all the office told me was that if I put in enough complaints, I can move into a different apartment BUT I would have to go through the whole leasing process AGAIN! Including paying deposits and all. What kind of service is that!? Other people arent following lease rules yet I am the one that has to be inconvenienced? They should really implement fees for disruptive behavior but they just dont want to deal with it. I understand there is normal noise from apartment living but when its constant stomping starting at 5am even on weekends, enough to make the lamps rattle, then it's a problem. Its total bull for the amount of money I pay here. I dont plan on renewing my lease and do not recommend this place to anyone that wants to live in peace<//review>

I was told Today after the fact that Casa Mira View has a “planned” water outage from 9-5pm. Apparently this is something they can do at random and does not have anything to do with the City. When I called they were unhelpful in explaining why this was going on and couldn’t care less. I have children and they don’t bother to let families know.</Text>

How can such a nice community hire such horrible staff members? They don't know how to fix a problem, much less do their job, and are rude (maybe even racist) especially to people who are non-native English speakers. Anytime there is a problem, the manager ignores our concern and says to email the customer service department, who have yet to give me a reply. REMEMBER: They CAN kick you out whenever they want. It's apparently a part of the lease agreement. There are a lot of empty spaces in the apartments and I can see why.
It's a really nice place to live but the service and regulations are horrible.
I wouldn't recommend this place to people who are trying to live a nice, quiet life.
They have the potential to be a 5 star community but their greed ruins that.</text>

Been looking to move in for a while now. Finally made the move back to San Diego and here I am! Although the speed bumps are a bit much, I completely understand what their purpose is. With a sue happy state like California, a business needs to protect not only its residents, but also itself. The amenities outweigh the speed bump complaint. I did hear there is a basketball court in the works, not sure I'll still be here but I hope so :) the area is perfect! Right off of the freeway and close to a ton of places. So, 5 stars from me! Can't wait to see how much better Casa Mira View gets over the next few years.</text>

It makes it really hard for our newborn to get any sleep.

<Text>After lived here for a while I realized that this was not as good as it seems at the beginning.  First of all, the management is really bad, after you sign the lease, solving anything including a simple fix would take weeks to months.  The manager Tami, never replies/calls me although she asked me to send her an email about my problem.  The construction quality also not good as far as I can tell.   Holes everywhere,  if I can attach pictures, I will show you the huge centipede I found from the bathroom.  After six months living in here, I can still smell formaldehyde (I am a chemist) releasing from my kitchen and all the walls. Really bad choice on my part.</Text>< pictures>

You will never see your deposit again! 5 previous leases and i always got my deposit back. Here,they took my deposit & asked for hundreds more, they will find the smallest and slightest issue for a vendor to fix it. The concept of expected wear and tear is completely lost on them, they will get the apartment back to brand new on your dime. Do your own professional cleaning (carpet, tub, fridge, etc) and make time for a walk through. Even then am sure they will find something. Once you move out your file is moved to "coorporate" who only respond via email...wonder why! Miserable end, i am advising all i know to stay far away< /review>

Loud Loud Loud!

Before we moved in we thought the highway was going to be very loud and uncomfortable. Once we moved in we realized it's not the highway we need to worry about it's the street by the entrance to the complex. Loud cars and motorcycles set car alarms offfff along the property line and the complex cannot do anything about it. It seems like something always wakes us up at night. We are 8 months into our 12 month lease and we cannot wait to move, we pay way tooooo much for this.<//Text>

<text>The customer service at CMV is unbelievably bad. Negligent would be a more appropriate term. I wanted to share my latest Casa Mira View customer service complaint with you. Trust me when I say this story is just one of many in the 15 months that I've lived here. Had a small gas grill fire on 5/29/17 (Memorial Day). No structural damages and sprinklers immediately kicked in. Both the Fire Dept and CMV maintenance crew told me that a good power wash and painting would resolve the issue. Lease expired on 7/31/17. Paid a $99 fee in order to roll lease over to month-to-month status. Informed that apartment passed mandatory inspection. Submitted 30 day notice on 8/24/17. Given the verbal ok to move. Served an eviction notice on 9/8/17 for a $3,000 balcony repair fee that nobody had mentioned to me before this point. Also, told that my 30 day notice to move was voided and I would be responsible for paying rent until the $3,000 fee was paid. To find out that you are being charged $3,000 for a fire that occurred 4 months ago is horrible. Not to mention, finding out in the form of an eviction notice on the same day that your new condo closes. I hope this story helps you understand what type of customer service to expect from CMV. Do your homework before moving here. Sadly, stories like mine are all too common around here</text>< date>

I was one of the first people who moved into the new phase of the complex. We had a 1 bedroom on the third floor. Initially we were very happy with our choice, the amenities were great and it was quiet.
Fast forward 6 months, and we constantly would wake up in the middle of sleep due to people upstairs running around or noise coming from neighbors. The building was full and busy and noisy.
In addition to this, the quality of the material used was not the best, so the maintenance had to repeatedly come in to fix clogged pipes and appliance issues. To be honest I did not expect things to fails so fast on a brand new apartment.
We moved out at the end of our one year lease and my expectation was to get most of our deposit back. Me and my wife were barely home so, the house was in perfect condition.
To my astonishment, I was charged to kitchen flooring replacement!!. They told me they found  a scratch. I am attaching the picture they sent me.
On top of this. I paid for the electricity they used. I did not stop my SDGE service after moving out. The SDGE website said if I cancel the service, they have to pay to restart it. I also thought, the cleaning crew would need power so I waited for them to take over. Well, surprise they didn't.
I asked them to pay for SDGE bill for the period after my move out date. Their response:
This is not our problem, this is between you and SDGE, it does not concern us
I am planning to pursue this in small claims court. To me Garden communities is competing with Irvine company and the customer service difference between the two is night and day.</Review><user>100457700049520009717<//user>< Name>

<username>william</username><Pics>None< /Pics><text>Casa Mira View doesn't have good securities, There is atleast 1 robbery per month, Im talking people braking into cars people stealing cars and the most common and unfortunate is when people are just able to easily just drive off with motorcycles right next to a security room that they have someone in sleeping every night. Casa Mira View is just wasting there money on securities to just direct traffic in the mornings, that's all i see them doing. The only way they try to stop all this is by calling the police department so they can rent one of their cars to use is as a dummy which is pretty stupid if you ask me and another waste of money option. If you are really considering to have a lease with these apt think twice or atleast tell the manager to make their security slugs to start walking around by actually touching sensors like other apt have that are waaaaaaay cheaper than these. Casa Mira View is not a smart way to go! Dont waste your money!</text>< resp>

I would like to give 5 stars however there are few things I don't like.
1- Speed bumps : They are awful if you are planning baby don't ever rent apartment on 5th floor. Your wife will  give early birth because of 20+ bumps all way up to 5th floor from  entrance.
2- Solar Panels:There are solar panels on 5th floor no matter how frequent you wash your car it always messes up because of water spilling on your car with dust from solar panels.

Amenities are awesome, Gym is great. Leasing staff is very helpful (not all of them)  Lady at reception desk is so kind and helpful.
Overall, it is really fun living in Casa Mira View.<//Review>

I have been asked by maintenance guy to comment on his work  so I give a guy 5 stars because he deserves it. I dont think there is anything wrong with asking that as long as you do your job right. His name is Jorge Ramirez, by the way. He tried his best to take care of whatever maintenance items we had (we had a long list after moving into apartment that someone was living in before us for a year or so.  Good job Jorge! I think all the guys in maintenance team are really taking care of requests properly (had been living in this community for almost 4 years now and never had any problems with them in terms of timeliness, accommodating your schedule and quality of work and other things of that sort).
Giving three stars to the community as a whole due to them seem unable to take care of following things:
--smoke-free status - they are unable to enforce it as smoking folks seem to find ways to smoke in the parking area, in their apartments (i suppose by tampering with smoke detectors), on balconies and patios hiding behind poles etc., so actually fumes make their way into non-smoker's homes and common areas;
--pet-free section (phase II) - is not a pet-free at all as folks are finding ways to have pets (mostly dogs) on the pretexts of those being companion (often times multiple) dogs. Not sure why they don't put those tenants into pet-friendly quarters at time of signing lease. I dont think anyone of them is paying high pet-rent either. I would like to have a little kitty, but it is $50 per month plus deposit, yeah, guess dont have that much of love left in me...;
--breaking the lease - they changed terms and now there is no flat-rate penalty provision left in there, so depending on the market you can get stuck paying high rent for the remainder of term if no one wants the unit, be cautious.
-- water/trash payment organization is not lenient for latency and charging $5 late fee, although they do not provide ebill service that can be paid in automated way and amount is changing based on usage so you have to be sure you follow up on each bill manually  for payment clearing before due date.

Probably i missed something else important here, will add if remember later.

Thank you for reading...<//review>

Looks good, but it's a ghetto!
The rent prices are close to unrealistic, though most people shrug it off to the many amenities they offer for curb appeal which are RARELY in working order, and when they are they're a shitshow of unsupervised children jumping, splashing, and eating in the hottub...etc.  For what they charge for rentals they fail to mention that half the property is low-income housing, so you'll be paying to neighbour with that.
The "smoke-free facility" is a joke - the place is littered with cigarette butts and I don't go a day without seeing and/or smelling someone smoking, mainly the staff/security, which explains why they're never at their stations -
Parking is an additional charge, but it's pointless because our parking stall is taken ALL THE TIME and Casa Mira staff/security do NOTHING about it.  They won't even allow you to have the illegally parked car towed from your PAID stall. They suggest you street park until your stall is open.
This is the only rental I've ever been in that passes their renter responsibilities off on the tenants, ie fresh paint and carpet cleaning between tenants.  This is without proof of wear and tear, this is standard contract, on top of your mandatory monthly fee for renters insurance.
And though they claim they provide maintenance, in 6 months and five service calls (for the same two issues) we've NEVER seen it.
We're on our way out, and from what we've read, we don't expect to see our deposit (despite leaving the apt in immaculate condition) we're just praying they don't try to scam us out of a couple hundred dollars worth of charges like they have other renters.< /Text>

Dog urine and feces in the hallway, stairwell, sidewalks, and washed down on our porch from the apartment above is a normal occurrence.  Garden communities property management doesn't respond to issues.

We moved into the new phase 2 building and have had numerous issues in the first 8 months of our lease. There have been issues with pets, my wife an myself are allergic to dogs and our neighbors above and on either side have dogs, though it is a pet free building. When we have had issues like our upstairs neighbors washing their dogs waste down off of their patio onto ours (multiple cases) we have filed complaints with the staff through the correct channels and have received no response/feedback/action from a dozen calls, emails, and in person conversations.

The atrocious service is the first part of my negative view of living here. The other aspects are the fellow residents, ridiculous driving within the parking structures and really annoying loud bass-heavy music late at night/early-morning.

Along with issues with both electrical-wiring aspects, the drier exhaust pipe, and plumbing under the sink. All three of which have had failures which need to be fixed, even though the unit we are living in only opened to the public for renting 12 months before we moved in.<//review>

I am livng here from past 2 years and I was 1 of the first tenants here. We loved the place for all this time and now its going from bad to worst. I am still a tenant

This is an apartment which has multi level parking, that means that you park your car in the same floor as your apartment. We need to go round and round to get to your level. Now thats not the present problem.

From past 1 year, they have been adding speed breakers and I agree that its a good thing. But How many do you expect. about 16 when driving from 4th floor to main road. 5th floor people have must worst situation.

The other bad thing is everytime we come home, we need to park in our place which is a pain. 16 bumps 1 way + stop signs.

1 more bad thing is that the bump are not straight, they are at an angle so that the car cant jump thru them which is again a pain

Help your self by not choosing this apartment. I am out of this asap. I will go and talk to the leasing office

I hope this helps< /Text>

The apartment very nice and clean we really love to stay , but our rent went up close $ 300 in less than 3 months after our lease expired , we couldn’t afford the high rent  so we decide to move out and look for another place, we never experienced that kind of rate increase anywhere else except in Casa Mira view.<//Text>
<Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1452639035037, 'text': 'Hello Naser,\n\nWe truly appreciate you submitting a review for Casa Mira View and we are very happy that you liked your apartment home. We are sorry to hear though that you were unable to continue to call our community your home.  In regards to the rent increase, it sounds like you had converted over to a month-to-month lease rate. Month-to-month leases are usually at an increased rate. Normally, if you sign a 1-year lease, your annual lease rate will be less. We would appreciate the opportunity to discuss another lease term at Casa Mira View with you, or at one of our sister communities. Please let us know and we can set up a time for you to speak with one of our on-site managers. Again, thank you for taking the time to submit this review, and know that we appreciated your valued residency and you calling Casa Mira View home.'}<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dbf91b33aa963b:0xc5db99380cb34ee7< /Gmap_id></record>

(Translated by Google) Very expensive and not everything is wow! The parking is horrible, small spaces for cars, dirty parking. The apartments are nice and the pool and gym part are nice, but they say that good service and I have not had that experience, my door was locked to enter the apartment and security did not act quickly!

Muy caro y no todo es wow! El estacionamiento es horrible, espacios pequeños para los carros, el estacionamiento sucio.

I usually do not purchase meat or poultry here but today I did. Today I spent $ 45 worth of "ranchera preparada"and it was all low quality. The meat was so hard I was not able to have a bite. When I ordered the meat it looked decent because they put the good meat on top of it, to deceit, they make customers believe that they are getting good quality when they in reality they do not appreciate their customers.In fact the meat looked like it was hammered to make it soft but still was bad. Definately not buying meat from them anymore. Thank you for reading.<//text>

<text>Got chicken and green chili tamales, I was greatly surprised how good they were.  They are not big , however great flavor.  There plain white corn tamales are delicious.  Cheese and green chili tamales are also great.  Oh my gosh they have the best store bought champurrado I have ever tasted.  I usually make it, however this year I made some and it went quickly.  Since I did not make tamales and bought at Northgate, decided to try Chsmpurado.  All my family commented how good it was, just like homemade.< /text>< pictures>

Good location and parking. They have all the essentials needed to make some good Mexican food. This location is a bit unorganized and they have fewer selection on items compared to other Northgates.</Text>

Right now, due to the very hard situation we are encountering that wherever we go there is not enough food, I would like to say that Northgate has been by far the best supermarket where you can find basic food and healthy food as well. Of course we have to make sure to take what we need and not over do it, we need to keep in mind that other families are in need as well. I give it a 5 start because everyone was very professional and under the circumstances they had great customer service.< /Review>

Today I went to their meat department to purchase a few items, they had what I needed but the stale date was January 30, when I asked one of the employees behind the meat counter if he could check if they had more in the back, he went to the meat department manager to ask him, the meat department manager took the expired item to the back and came back to give it to me and said it was a new one but all he did was re-tag it with a new expiration date. I immediately called him out on it and he said it wasn't. I then lifted the new tag in front of him and the old expired tag was under. When I asked him why he would do something like that, he stated that the item was still good and that's what they did. I looked over the meat counter and he had multiple of the same items re-tagged. I spoked with the store manager and he acted like he didn't know what was going on. He ran to the meat department and started taking pictures of the re-tagged items. This place deserves a visit from the health department or whom ever handles this kind of things.

Is that what they normally do with all their expired products???

I think I should call them. I'm sure their camera footage will prove what I'm stating.<//text>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Northgate Gonzalez Market has been one of my favorite until recently. I have had recent experiences where I am not provided with the expected courtesy that is given to customers in most businesses. During busy times only a couple of registers are open. I have been told to switch lines just when I'm about to place my groceries. I also tried to speaking to the manager, Susana in this case, and was treated extremely rude.<//review>< Time>

Went in during my lunch break to grab a red bull and a sweet bread then waited in the express 10 items or less lane for my entire 30 minute break!!
Cashier was charging me $30+ for the 3 items and had to get store manager involved bc cashier  was adamant that the total was correct.
Not shopping here anymore.</Text>

I believe that this is a great place to buy food. It has a good Latino vibe. The product is of great value. There are plenty of veggies to choose from at what I think is a good price. Further from that the people who go shopping for food there are friendly locals. The staff are great speaking both English and Spanish. There is plenty of parking space although this market does get full fast.  So come on by and buy from our friendly neighborhood market.</Review>

I love coming to this store but this is the 2nd time that I order chicken from the meat department and by the next day when I want to cook it - it stinks!

It has an awful smell - that I don't even want to put it on my car to go return it.</Text>

Like that they have food prepared this is hot food. The tamales are okay and the soup is the best 5 to 7 different types of soups. Hot food from carnitas, enchiladas, beans, rice and so on. It's like a nice little Buffet but charge by the pound for the hot food. Seafood from one person to four in packages.<//Review>

Great market; it has a home made style food deli; aguas frescas, tamales, and fruit salads. There's a Mexican bakery store selling Pan de Muertos 😀 unfortunately;  the store and cashier aisles are too narrow.< /Text>

<Text>I’ve been coming here for a long time but honestly their check out line are long and the not 2 cashiers usually. I’ve been going to other local markets because they keep up their demand of the area. This location is particular has bad parking spots. But their selections are great.< /Text>< Pictures>

I love this market. The meats are always fresh and the staff is usually knowledgeable and polite. I have purchased some of their cooked foods as well which are really great. The only one thing I'm not a fan of is there fish ceviche, I find that the fish is cut in such huge chunks that the lemon and other flavors do not penetrate as well as might be expected the end result is a little too raw and fishy for my taste. Of course that is just my preference. The shrimp and octopus ceviche however is delicious. As are their tripitas and guacamole.< /Review>

Worst experience, they just look at you instead of helping you. You ask them for help and they turn the other way around and walk away from you and when they finally answer you they answer back with a negative  acttidue. I had higher expectations for them but the department next to cosina totally fail on making the guest happy, giving a good customer service and on everything. Food was alright but rather go waste my money somewhere where they’ll treat me right instead of making me feel some type of way instead of helping me. Wouldn’t recommend!<//Review>

<Text>Is convinient and near me
Downside is that wen me or my family buy poultry and meat some times is bad goin to green nasty
And wen there is a lot of people they dont open more register

I SAW A BIG FAT RAT! About 2mths ago, I went in for some good bolillo, right after work.   I saw a Big Rat limping from one side to the other of an aisle. I immediately told an employee and I heard and saw as she was telling her manager. I didnt take anything. IM NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS NORTHGATE.<//Review>

I just bought a coctel de camaron here and im  so disappointed because when you look at it in the shelf it looks like its filled with shrimp but when you open it and eat the few shrimps thats on the top of it all the cup is filled with tomato juice and pico de gallo it costs 6.99 and its not worthy at all beware of this scam and do not buy this coctel de camaron, its more suitable to be call coctel de pico de gallo!!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The simple truth, The Ranchera Carme And The Beef Ribs Does Not Serve From This Store, Yesterday February 28 We Went To Buy Carme To Roast And Nooooo, So I went, the well dried meat without flavor, my $ 140 of meat to the garbage. People Who Bring Everything Into The Butcher Shop With Very Ugly Attitude Will Never Go Back To A Marketa Gonzales.

(Original)

Las Personas Que Trajan En La Carnicería Todo Con Atitud Bien Feo , Nunca Volvere A Una Marketa Gonzales .< /review>

(Translated by Google) You know, I bought something at the butcher's but they didn't put a price on a package and the cashier told me to fix it, I tell her, I don't send someone, she says I don't know anyone, it's fine, I don't take the priceless one when I finish paying She tells me that I already have someone who will want it and the same person who was packing it sent it back when she was there from the beginning, this cashier feels like she owns the store.

(Original)
Sabes compre algo en la carniceria pero a un paquete no le pusieron el precio y me  dice la cajera  baya que se lo arreglen  le digo yo no manda a alguien dice no tango a nadie esta bien no me llebo el que no tiene precio terminando de pagar me dice ya tengo alguien lo va querer y  la misma persona que estaba enpacando la mando  cuando desde el prinsipio estaba all esta cajera se siente  muy propietaria de la tienda no quise hablar con su  supervisora para decirle que Tongan personal mas amables</review>

(Translated by Google) In this particular store I do not like it because the employees are unkind, I feel that if the owner or the Manager demanded that his employees greet and be more attentive I would go back to a store where the staff takes good care of you, I think it would be a excellent store, a few years ago they had many promotions and not to mention Mexican food, promotions are needed to resume their beginnings, when you are going to send a remittance the ladies who are sitting there in a bad way serve you I think they should pay more attention

(Original)
En esta tienda en particular no me gusta por que los empleados son poco amables, siento que si el dueño o el Mánager exigiera que sus empleados saludarán y estuvieran más atentos y o regresa a una tienda da donde el personal te atiende bien, creo que sería una tienda excelente, hace algunos años tenían muchas promociones y no se diga de la comida Mexicana, Hacen falta promociones retomar sus inicios, cuando vas a mandar una remesa las señoritas que están ahí sentadas de mal modo te atienden creo que deberían de poner más atencion</text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Before it was fine but now everything is very bad starting with the prices everything is very expensive, or the owner should think about what we are going through right now and help even a little bit in the prices, apart from the ridiculous lines that are made to enter, one line to go to the butcher and another to buy the rest. What is that.

(Original)
Antes estaba bien pero ahora todo está muy mal empezando con los precios todo está muy caro, los o el dueño debería pensar en lo que ahorita estamos pasando y ayudar aunque sea un poquito en los precios, aparte las ridículas líneas que se hacen para entrar, una línea para ir a la carnicería y otra para comprar lo demás.

(Translated by Google) I like this place, it has what I need, prepared food, freshly baked bread, food products from my country, kindness and cleanliness. What they need to give them 5 to crash is that they will try the food before selling it because sometimes it does not taste good.
