My friend wanted a fried chicken sandwich and we found Dave's on a Sunday night. I love the menu options and the number of heat levels there are. I got a medium and my friend got a hot tender and extra hot sandwich. The  chicken was really good with the medium having a decent amount of heat to it. There was a short line at the time we went which was much longer when we were leaving but it was definitely worth.< /Text>

<Review>One of the most delicious sushi experiences we've ever had. Nestled in between pubs & bike tour shops on Hyde St, this place is a little hidden gem. If we're ever in SF again, we'll definitely visit Grandeho's again!</Review><username>Autumn Bradshaw</username>< user>

A long-time neighborhood gem, Grandeho's is one of those rare places where the food, personal service and ambiance all stand out... Nothing fancy, but the quality of the food always brings us back.  Featuring a variety of Asian food such as fresh sushi, seafood, noodles, etc.  The owner is a local resident and it's obvious this restaurant is a part of her family, and the hospitality always shines through.  Prices are a little on the high side, but the quality of the food is worth it.< /text>

I had the basic California roll (I'm not big in sushi) and shrimp tempura. It was delish, but the customer service is what earned the 5 stars!</Review>

Fantastic sushi restaurant, vast menu, so many options, just too much to choose from. The combo dishes and rainbow rolls give you lots of fish to try. Grab a seat at the bar and watch your dinner carefully prepared in front of you.<//Text>

First time here. I've been searching for decent sushi in the area for over a year, and finally I find it. Honestly the best sushi in the city. Great service as well. I had a bento box with salmon skin roll (amazing) and salted mackerel (even better) and veggie egg rolls, also sublime.<//Review>

Great selection of Japanese comfort food. The ambiance was cozy and it was full of amazing artwork. We got bento boxes so we could fill up for touring, they were packed with many yummy and authentic Japanese favorites at reasonable prices.</Review>

A true gem in the Wharf district of San Francisco.

My wife and I love to find small local places to dine when we travel, and the hotel concierge suggested this unassuming eatery for "really good sushi".   Grandeho's Kamekyo did not disappoint.  It's not cheap, but the rolls were fresh and service was prompt. Everything we wanted from a casual night out.

There are "hipper" places, and if that's your thing, you might be disappointed.  That's definitely not my thing, though, and it was an easy 2 block walk from our hotel located almost on top of Fisherman's Wharf.

It's worth noting that they do NOT participate in Monterrey Bay Aquarium's "seafood watch" program, so you can get some fish there that are on the "avoid" list.  This is probably no surprise to folks who know about the relationship of the Japanese to Pacific Ocean fishing, but if that's not a problem for you, it was an amazing evening.  If it *is* a problem for you, you can always take the SeaFood Watch app with you and refrain from ordering those items.

Overall, we had a wonderful evening of fresh fish.  I highly recommend a visit if you are in the area and in search of great sushi.<//review>

I don't like they abuse of the customer trust. The final bill includes the tip, which is 18%.
There is a sign at the entrance with low size showing you they will charge the tips. Obviously you will read it (if you have very good vision and you focus to these area) when you finish.
Plates are good but prices are high. And, as I said previously, you will get a big surprise when the ticket comes to your table.
I'm sure I'll never come back here.</text>

<text>This place is a find.  A well-rounded menu that happened to have fatty tuna on special when I went.  Wide selection that makes me want to come back for a lot more. Not far from the tourist trap nearby but the locals dine there.  Catch that classic San Francisco vibe with cable cars going by the door and a glimpse of the Golden Gate Bridge just down the street.< /text><Response>None< /Response>< date>

After a long day of driving from San Diego, we ended up here. It was absolutely delicious, probably the freshest sushi ive ever had. We had the rainbow plate, oven baked salmon rolls, miso soup, and some local beer. It was soo good. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Small place but I like the cozier environment. Highly recommend!</text>

Ordered the Seattle roll (baked salmon and avocado). I found the roll to be a little dry, and there was barely any avocado. I was also  asked to pay in cash. I would likely go back but for something different.<//Review>

The Philadelphia roll is one of the best I’ve had in a while. Overall it was Ana amazing experience. Next time I am in San Francisco I will definitely be returning.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>Well presented restaurant, with helpful friendly service. Prices seemed to be a bit higher than we generally pay around town, but given the location, that's to be expected. On top of the pricing was a fixed 18% gratuity for all parties, regardless of size. Serving sizes were generous, including the rolls. They were well prepared for, and extremely accommodating with young kids, which was a delightful and much appreciated surprise!<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>Superfresh sushi made in a delicate way. A bit pricy though but 5 stars for that. But I sat at the bar and I had to hear the sound of 3 different tv screens with different channels (the one at the dinning room, the one at the bar, and the one the cook had one). Not a pleasant experience. The manager should take that into account.<//Text>< userid>

Fish was all very fresh, with nice size portions and attention was prompt.  My wife and I had our youngest child with us and they took good care of him too.

Prices are what you would expect to pay for this area, and the quality justifies the cost.

This place is among the top 5 sushi place I've been to.  The interior is completely Japanese and the service was great.

I sat at the bar and watched the chef sculpt each piece of fish with great care and put thought into aligning every element that was presented.  The place is on the spendy side, so come when you really want to indulge!</Text>

<Review>Probably one of the best sushi restaurants you can find outside of Japan; for that reason, expect a wait! The fish taste very fresh and well chosen. The Uni, was the only item of our choices which could have been better. The Tempora is phenomenal and the Miso Soups (both regular and with mushroom) were delicious.</Review>< Pics>

<resp>None</resp><date>1535332714654<//date><Text>Only okay quality sushi. Prices were a little expensive. We ordered 4 different rolls, the cherry bomb, spider roll, Seattle roll and chef's special roll. The raw fish quality was only so so. Chef's special was a mish mash of raw fish and vegetables garnished with some deep fried vermicelli. Looked kind of like a grade school art project. The flavors were not complimentary.

The restaurant is very interestingly decorated, to say the least. Korean, Japanese, Chinese accents with year round Christmas decor.< /Text><Rate>3< /Rate>< user_id>

The food is a little bit pricey but the cooks and waitresses are so nice and the food is so good that it doesn't even matter because it's so worth it. I would definitely recommend the stop for anyone who's comfortable spending a little bit of cash.</Review>

Nice selection of options to choose from for the bento box, and it came with - salad which was tasty and had fresh fruit bits, white rice and two smaller sides (top left in bento box photo). Prices are a bit expensive, but that's SF for you. Service was great, and staff super friendly.< /review>< Pics>

Nice, chill place to have dinner with friends. The prices are a bit high, but they give you huge portions. The food is yummy and filling.  Service is not bad; somewhat slow, but they are friendly. Interesting decor, mixed of Christmas deco and random art pieces.</text>

The only thing that made me dock a star is their practice of including gratuity for all party sizes and unusually high prices for what you're getting<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808580e13cd891e9:0x8ef2442c19df560c</GmapID></record>

We found this local family owned restaurant by accident at the end of a long day around the city & were pleasantly surprised. Servers were so kind to us and our kids even though I always cringe when taking the 2 year old to any public place. They were helpful and the sushi was excellent! We ordered Won Ton’s & Bento Box for the kids and the Rainbow, Cable Car (amazing!), Dynamite, and Cali roll for the family. All was delivered in appropriate timing giving us time to eat each course and help the kids eat. Atmosphere was great and lots of locals showed up as well so you know it’s a known place considering all the options around town. Prices were very reasonable unlike many of the touristy spots in the area that gouge you for sub par meals and experiences.< /review>

I would categorise this restaurant: "fusion" rather than Japanese.
I ordered teriyaki salmon, it felt like American salmon steak and gyoza was similar to a Korean styled dumpling.
The impression was interesting, however taste was great!<//Review>

Conclusion: Japanese sushi restaurant with a little Chinese flavor.
I was just suspecting it is owned by Chinese when I saw those Chinese calligraphy on the wall, then I saw the cabbage(or Chinese cabbage) on top of ramen, I was 100% sure😑... a little overpriced, tasted Okay though.</Text>

Stayed 2 nights in San Francisco and decided to try this place out on our first night , we liked it so much we came back the 2nd night . They are so incredibly welcoming , the food is so fresh, tried catering to our picky son , and on top of it they have us "on the house* appetizers, soup and salad. Wonderful, food , atmosphere and  people. Please try this place out , I can't say enough good things about it .< /Review>

<Text>Only did a little Salmon sashimi this time because we were craving ramen.... which was DELICIOUS.  We got the spicy one with extra noodles and couldn't finish, though we kept trying because it was just so tasty. And everyone was sooooo friendly.  Only beer and wine served though, which was sad for this liquor enthusiast :)< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<text>When we went, whoever makes half of the advertised specialty drinks was not there, so we could not order them.  We didn't find this out until after we were seated.  Also, they forgot to put the meat in our ramen, and when they brought it out later to fix the issue, the meat was cold.  Finally, the food was just average.  Nothing really to write home about.  We didn't like the taste, but the quality was still okay.  All these things together, though, make it 2/5.<//text>< time>

Good fresh sushi, but the menu prices are a little steep for what you get, likely cause of the location. Menu prices arent the same as the ones posted online, it's a few dollars more per item.< /text>

If you're looking for authentic Japanese sushi this isn't the place, but I was still pleasantly surprised to find it pretty good.<//review>

Casual mom-and-pop sushi place with friendly service and fresh fish. The wife and I ordered Sushi Boat A ($60), which was the perfect amount of sushi for the both of us. Fresh, good quality fish, and the boat had a great mix of rolls v. sushi v. sashimi. They also brought out a few small complimentary side dishes for us (kimchi, bean sprouts, cucumber, etc.) while the sushi was being prepared, which was a welcome surprise. We came at 2PM on a Tuesday and there was only one other table occupied, which made for a nice quiet, peaceful meal. Will come back here next time I'm in the Fisherman's Wharf area!</Review>

The staff at Grandeho's Kamekyo is very kind and attentive. The prices are fair and the food is fresh!
I stopped in to eat dinner on my own and the restaurant wasn't particularly busy but they just started working on a large order for a big party. The server got me started on soup, communicated that it may be a few minutes for my entree, but quickly fulfilled my nigiri order even though the sushi chef was very busy.
The salmon nigiri is a larger portion of salmon than I've been used to and the scallops were amazingly fresh.
I definitely plan to make this a regular stop!</Text>

<text>Exceptional sushi experience! We ordered a couple of rolls, sushi, and the chef special sashimi platter. Sushi Chef David did not disappoint. The quality of the sashimi was perfect.  We even received a few surprise bonus pieces.  We will definitely return and refer friends.< /text>< pics>

<Review>Wow, I was just in the area and felt like some comforts of Japanese cuisine, walked in and sat at the bar for an amazing omakase (chefs choice) from chef Tran, who displayed a beautiful spread of sashimi and nigiri that tantalized my taste buds. The lovely servers made sure my beer and sake needs were met to the utmost.

All around a 5 Star Japanese cusine experience.

I recommend this hidden gem to any and everyone from this meal on!

The sushi was fine: nothing special. The red snapper was awful. Overcooked, rubbery, barely palatable. The worst part was the waitress insisted that was how it was supposed be since it was pan fried and refused to adjust our bill in any way. Disappointing.</Review>

<Text>he sushi was good.
not the best, but good.

the service was lacking.

they raped us on gratuity.

$48 bill = $10 gratuity added in.
total bill= $58

$15 bill = $5 gratuity
total bill = $20

won't go back.

<Review>We got 2 rolls of sushi--the Cherry Blossom Roll (salmon, cucumber, avocado and tuna) and the Bay Roll (scallop, crab meat, wasabi sauce, salmon and lemon). Both were delicious! I took off the lemon rinds that were on mine but it didn't take away any of the lemon flavor. I loooved the sushi! The chicken teriyaki was good. The tofu teriyaki was, according to my mom, "excellent," and she doesn't use that word to describe food often. My parents also ordered the tofu soup, which they said was good, but we were so full at that point that they could only eat one bite!

My family absolutely loved this restaurant, we ended up going twice! We felt very taken care of and well attended to. We celebrated our parents' anniversary the second time we went and they gave us a super cute fruit plate with little cubes of oranges and a really amazing duck made out of an apple! This place is wonderful and we highly recommend it.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808580e13cd891e9:0x8ef2442c19df560c<//Gmap_id></record>

I can't say anything about the food, because we left the restaurant after over 10 minutes waiting for the waitress. She just showed us with the finger where we have to sit. We were one of three tables in the restaurant, so it was no reason to let wait us so long.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Two of them went in with the thought of simply cooking meals, but it was nice to see Korean songs coming out. All the sushi is very soft and the staff is really friendly :)

두명이서 간단하게 끼니를 떼울 생각으로 들어갔는데, 한국 노래가 흘러나오고 있어서 반가웠습니다. 모든 스시가 굉장히 부드러우며 직원은 정말 친절합니다 :)< /text>

(Translated by Google) I thought I was going to a Korean restaurant and I went to the store and the kimchi that I ate was delicious. I made spicy tofu with spicy but it wasn't spicy at all, but it wasn't traditional Korean food.

여행 중 한식 생각나서 찾아보다 가게 됐는데 직접 담근 김치가 맛있었어요 순두부를 스파이시로 시켰지만 전혀 맵지 않았고 전통 한식맛은 아니지만 재료가 신선하고 많이 들어있어서 좋았어요 회덮밥도 맛있었구요 직원분도 친절하셨어요< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Great food & service! Must go if you’re in this area.
It's run by Koreans, so they give you kimchi as a side dish and salmon kimbap as an additional service. The sashimi is also fresh and very friendly. I will have to stop by the next time I come.

한국사람이 운영하는 곳이라 김치 밑반찬 섭스로 주시고 연어김밥도 추가서비스로 주시네요. 회도 신선하고 굉장히 친절합니다. 다음에 오게되면 또 들러야 겠네요.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It is a treasure spot that I found while trying to find a restaurant, but I was closed on Sunday because I was so hungry that I was closed on Sunday. I know you're Korean, and you gave me more rice and it was kind and nice. It is also delicious. I was the one who didn't know why I came to the United States to find Korean food, but I was really impressed because I ate rice after eating only flour. Please flourish ~ ^^

원래 맛집 찾으러 가려다 일요일 휴무인거 알고 허탈한 마음으로 배가 너무 고파서 숙소 근처로 알아보다가 발견한 보물같은 곳입니다. 한국인인거 아시고 밥도 더 많이 주시고 넘 친절하고 좋았어요. 맛도 있구요. 미국까지 와서 한국음식 왜 찾는지 모르겠는 1인이 저였는데 느끼한거랑 밀가루만 먹다가 쌀을 먹으니 정말 감동이였습니다. 번성하세요~^^<//Review>

Very good oriental store . Found everything I needed including my favorite Indonesian Rendang spice mix and Nasi Goreng too. They have a variety of products from a multitude of different asian countries including fresh produce every Thursday night- all at really affordable prices and excellent customer service with a smile and sincere appreciation for your business. I was really impressed and I went shopping there three days in the row. Keep up the good work. 😊🙏</Review>

Great selection of Asian ingredients. Fresh groceries come in Thursday evenings around 5:30pm but it gets busy during this time. If you need something, you can request it and the owner will have it for you within a week.< /Text>

<Text>The person who is asking what service you need is not wearing a mask and either the owner and his son, They seem very arrogant and if you don’t want to risk your health  DONT COME HERE!!!

I also red this review  which is very accurate !

My rating has nothing to do with service but nowadays protection is far more important. Nobody working there had face covers. I had mine and I thought only the person asking what service I needed was the only one without it but as I went inside to pay I notice that nobody had mask. I asked the owner and he told me it was too hot to wear a mask.<//Text>< Rate>

<date>1620869787844< /date><Rate>1</Rate><Text>I should have read the recent reviews before coming here. The only reason I brought my car here is because I didn’t want my new car to get scratched by the huge revolting rolls in express car washes. Out of 12 employees that I saw, only two of them were wearing masks. And they didn’t use any forms of safety to sit inside the car. I say this because in other places, where they are safe, they put a sterilized plastic on the seat and surfaces that they will be touching. Also, they used the same cloth (that was already dirty) for all of my car.
If I could give it zero stars I would.< /Text>< Pics>

Hi its summer time, I walked in twice and explained my car came out of wash and wasn't touched for over 30 minutes.
Water and soap stains all over the car.
Totally unprofessional,  I Will Not Recommend.
$20.00 for dirty wash, unacceptable service<//review>

I guess they don’t know what is “car wash” mean in English(no wonder they are all Mexican). I bought my car and asked for $27 service and it came out as $33(so they charged 20% tax, maybe in Mexico is 20%). They spent 5 minutes for exterior drive through wash(the machine is soooo old and basically can’t wash your car at all). After that, you wait for 25 minutes for a person to take your car. Of course he washed 5 minutes, you are ready to give tip and ready to go! Check the pictures for their definition for “car wash.” Such a fun place! Lol...</review>

Brought it back 2 days later and did not want to take any responsibility for it. I decided to give them another try and brought my mother's car for an oil change and car wash. I kept noticing that her car was leaking oil. Took it back to them and they said I had nothing to do with the work they've done. Never using their services again!</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Rate>2</Rate><Review>The price for a hand carwash is acceptable. However, the waiting area is very uncomfortable and lacks shade. Aside from my comfort as a customer, I find the employees being in the sun all day fairly concerning. The person at the register is not friendly at all. It's like they're doing me a favor by taking my money. Also, when I was about to leave, the manager or owner held my keys like I was some sort of thief. He didn't give them until he confirmed at the register even though I had shown him the receipt. Talk about rude!
I'm only giving two stars because the car was clean, but it still had a few smudges on the windshield.<//Review>< pics>

I like that they’re open a bit later than the other car wash facilities in the area (which close around 5pm before anyone is off work and I guess don’t like money). However, a 4 year old could have done a better job. My car is not clean at all. Complete waste of money.< /Text>

<review>This is the best car wash around. If you get your seats shampooed ask them to suck up as much water as they can. I have been coming here for 8 years. I pass up another hand car wash on the way. I will see you guys soon.

Thanks for your quality service.<//review>< Pictures>

They were NOT wearing mask and the person that give you the receipt didnt care to wear one so I have to leave since  I am not risking my health  ;)  In times like this is very irresponsible not to wear masks particularly when you are entering other people's cars.<//Review>

I’d say 3 out of 5, due to the fact that my car was very clean when it got it again, although they didn’t clean/take out any of the trash in my car, they left the miscellaneous plastic fast food cups in the doors still, super tacky. Any other car wash knows that’s trash, and it’s their job to clean it out.<//text>

Terrible experience. STAY AWAY from this place. Paid $150 for a FULL inside detailed and polished the exterior and my seats still have the same stains and scratched the paint.  Spoke to whom I was told it's the person I  charge and his only answer was : Nothing to discuss, we will do it again.  Guess what. Brought it back and they said my car was polished the first time and there was nothing else to do.  Don't waste your money with this people.  They just lost 4 clients today.<//Text>

It seems it's the common practice for all car washes. Word of advice, don't waste your time and bring your car to be washed to this place when there is rain forecast. It would've been nice for the owners to put a sign that says that the car wash is closed when it rains. The sign says that it opens on Mondays at 8 am which is false advertising.< /review>< response>

<resp>None<//resp><text>Update: Sadly, after my initial review they raised their prices and now even the Early Bird Special is not so special.  The Early Bird is the same price as a regular priced wash at other car washes.  Their regular price is now more than other car washes in the area.  Very disappointing.

They do a fantastic job.  I always go for the Early Bird Special it's cheaper than any other car wash in the area even with a coupon.<//text><rating>3< /rating><date>1540377709342< /date><Name>Joann Spinelli<//Name><user_id>116427959475292546928<//user_id>< Pics>

<Text>Very bad service. The person that vaccumed my car did a horrible job there was dirt everywhere. I paid $16 and I expect to get my moneys worth. He just swiped the vaccum once on each side of the car and didnt even take 5 minutes. Crapy job and crapy wash. Dont go here. Save your money.<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The worst thing in car wash they treat cars badly, they don't clean them well, especially an old man who, because he is older and their family, does not care that the car is badly dried and badly cleaned. The worst thing, the boy who gives you the tickets for the service you want is super arrogant and rude, when I told him that it was badly dried he told me that this was the express wash only for out of $ 12.99 that as I paid little that was the work, for pay that better I wash it in one of $ 5 And the vacuumes free since not even at that price they pass the vacuum
the first time and the last I do not recommend the worst there is in north hollywood

(Original)
Lo peor que hay en car wash tratan mal los carros, no los limpian bien, en especial un señor ya grande que por ser mayor y familia de ellos no le llaman la atención que esta mal secado el carro y mal limpio. Lo peor el muchacho que te da los tickets del servicio que quieres es super arrogante y mal educado, cuando le dije que estaba mal secado  me dijo que asi era el lavado express solo por fuera de $12.99 que como pague poco ese era el trabajo, para pagar eso mejor lo lavo en uno de $5 Y el vacuumes gratis ya que ni xon ese precio pasan la vacuum
la primera vez y la ultima no se los recomiendo lo peor que hay en north hollywood< /Review>

I visited this studio while traveling on business in San Francisco. The front desk was incredibly responsive with getting me set up for class and the studio has a nice layout compared to some others, which don’t allow enough space to move. They provide towels, which is a plus and not often found at other studios. But the BEST thing about this studio is Quinton. He was an incredible coach. Very patient when offering corrections and motivating each person to push past limits. What a gem!  I hope to be back soon.<//text>

< Review>
My first class was an awesome experience. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Jessica made me feel like no question was silly and helped me understand the theory behind the heart rate monitor. Coach Rio was very helpful and kind! I was worried because I am post-op for a hip surgery about 6 1/2 months ago. I got a really good workout in without hurting myself or my hip. I also was able to get the correct form so I work my muscles and reduce stress to my injured side. The class dynamic was also awesome - some of it was individual work and at the end there was a team activity.

I’ve been to another two clases now. Coach Q was very supportive and made sure that I modified any activities that were bothering my hip. He also explained how to use the rower step by step, and the numbers you see on the screen. Now I feel confident to use any of the machines in the studio.

I highly recommend you go to the introductory class! You don’t be disappointed!!< /Review>

<Review>The workouts are amazing and challenging, but what really makes this place great is the staff. They are on top of things, but they are incredibly great to interact with and I consider some of them my friends. The community  of people that workout here are also amazing. Its always a friendly place and people are encouraging and supportive.</Review></record></dataset><record>

It's so motivating to track your numbers and try to beat your record each day. Instead of being competitive with one another, I love that you only need to be competitive with yourself. The teachers are so motivating and the front desk staff is so friendly. I'm addicted!< /review>

<Review>Interesting class that focuses on quickly shifting heart rate by having you alternate between comfortable walking pace and intense periods of exertion. Feasible for all fitness levels since you set your own 'base pace'. Rating three stars because I am not at all into the heart rate chest straps you are instructed to wear as they cause significant discomfort when running. Also, note that not designed for after class showers or lingering: small narrow waiting area + only two showers.</Review>< Pics>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>Small fitness studio with guided group classes/workouts, boot camp-style. Depending on time of day, you can get from a few people to a crowded room (I believe 24 is the max, which is a lot of people for its small space).

Coaches are friendly and the heart rate monitor workout helps you keep track of your goals and target. I feel that sometimes some of the coaches try to push people to go farther/faster/heavier than they should, but of course you're not forced into it.

Nice premium fitness studio, not for the light of wallet. Similar concept/style in many ways to Barry's Fitness (which is literally across the street from them); except, I like the space at Orangetheory better, because you can see outdoors and it's not a dark, enclosed windowless tunnel like the Barry's across the street.

Overall a really good workout with good facilities and friendly coaches. Really needs more bathrooms/showers (they only have 2 each), but they literally have no more space.< /review>< pics>

Terrible service inside, overcharged for basic food and drink items. No price tags, lots of "hidden" fees that the cashier justifies and then immediately runs out of English to continue the conversation. Do not buy anything, even gas. Shell station is worth the extra 10cents and the Flyers up the road is a better deal and friendlier service. Absolutely horrible experience here, avoid like the plague.< /review>

So kind! And 40 cents cheaper than all the rest of the gas stations in town. Owner was kind and noticed we were tourists and asked about our trip! So nice!
Only negative is the restroom is kinda sketch, but it also looked like it wasn't a customer toilet. So don't know if he just took pitty on us lol
Did do a random charge though<//Review>

<text>Wow wow wow. Had a great time. The ride had a few changes and they were nice additions.  It's time for a Universal Studios Hollywood visit. We had a fantastic time and can not wait to go again.  It was not overcrowded and I actually rode EVERY RIDE.  Yes, EVERY ride. Also went to all shows that were open and I was only there from 9-5. Great time. Can't wait to return!!!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bfa80ded01e7:0x8570895ba0ac8137< /Gmap_id></record>

Ok... I must admit I miss the Jurassic Park doors opening when you start the ride... and Predator cove upgrade is fun with bushes shaking but still lacking a suspenseful element... but I must admit the additions to the dark part of the ride are spot on phenomenal.  You get a glimpse at Blue! And a huge Dino fight before the drop... The updates and lighting are simply awesome.  Kudos Universal! Now if you could just double the length of the ride... 😆.<//text>

The ride has been updated during the pandemic lockdown and it I'd AWESOME!  Everything is so realistic.  Even my 6 year old super dinosaur fan loved this ride so much that she wanted to keep going onnit again and again.  The staff does an excellent job at covid precautions.  Warning....you will definitely get wet! Lol</review>

For 6 boats from the express queue, there is one of the usual, this is a real mockery.  I understand that you want to make money by selling express tickets, but you need to somehow find a compromise: for example, one boat is loaded from the express queue, the other from the usual one, otherwise I see no reason to buy and come to this park with ordinary tickets.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

When my favorite ride Jurassic Park was closing and was being replaced by Jurassic World, I had mix feelings. I loved Jurassic World  and I liked Fallen Kingdom but I didn't want change! 10 months later, I was expecting the ride to be ruined by screens and it would end up like Fast and Furious Supercharged. Fortunately, I was wrong. This is everything I wanted for a Jurassic themed ride. Sure there are screens but they only use it for absolute necessary. It's nice seeing the old anamitronics, as well as seeing new ones too. Especially the indominus Rex. It looks straight out of Jurassic World and steals the show. I have little to no problems with this ride.

Tho, they need to bring back Dilophosaurus for Jurassic World 3. #bringbackthedilophosaurus</text>

<Text>One of the best drops around. Absolutely reffifying. Rest of the ride is filler but still fun. Worth the 90 minute wait? Probably not. But on a hot day very nice wet zone stuff. Take single rider line if you are not option for pictures. Fastest way in.< /Text>< date>

A great ride that I'd recommend to nearly anyone.

Although the wait times are one of the longest within the park, at least Universal tried to keep you entertained with widescreen screens that tell you fun facts, give "interviews" to Jurassic world employees, and more. It was quite a while before I noticed the loop restarted, so plenty of new content to stare at.

The ride itself is pretty neat, and the "big" drop wasn't horrible at all (although the only restraint is one lap bar for the row, so only the person with the biggest legs will be completely secured)

There are lockers to store items in, but at the rather high cost of five dollars, so just wear your bags backwards and hang on to your smaller items. They'll be fine.</text>

<Text>I've been riding Jurassic Park for years but they just leveled up in 2019 and they did good...

The theme is still the same as you're on a boat tour through Jurassic Park  and things go sideways with dinosaurs getting loose.  The dinosaurs movement is much more realistic and less robotic throughout the ride. When your boat starts going vertical to the big drop section, instead of a 'water treatment area' you're heading into 'T-Rex Kingdom'. They added a predator cove in this area as well.
Right before the big drop you come across a FULL Bodied T-Rex fighting it out with another dinosaur.  Before the upgrade, it was just a T-Rex head terrorizing you before you dropped down.  This is much more scary and awesomely realistic.  Well done.

***SPOILER ALERT: I'm about to review the new aquarium section.  If you want to be surprised, stop reading here. =)

At the beginning of the tour, you enter the aquarium observatory.  You come across these massive screens that show case the aquarium and they are awesomely realistic.  You find yourself staring into them as your tour boat peacefully coasts through.  When the massive Mosasaurus appears, it chomps down a shark and aggressively swims around the 'tank'  Then it charges the observation glass at full speed cracking the window and which point water blasts down on the boat.  Choreographed perfectly and it definitely took me by surprise.

It was super popular before the upgrade and even more so.  We waited 20 minutes with the express pass and it was a 3 hour wait via the general admission line.  However you get there, this new Jurassic Tour ride is a definite must see.  Enjoy!< /Text>< pics>

<text>Universal Studios splash mountain. Long , I mean Long wait. The ride is done well, there just isn't much to it. Like all the other rides, the entertainment is on the screens. It was fun, but for a a couple tiny drops and a single big drop it's not worth the wait. You will get a little wet.< /text><user_id>112022103718861809216</user_id>< Pics>

<Review>The ride is average, but be warned.

You don't have the express pass. You'll be waiting in line over 2 hours on the weekend.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) For me one of the best rides in the park. It's fun and you get a little wet too. You can discover a lot. Unfortunately you have to queue there for a long time!

(Translated by Google) It's a fair, a park that you can enjoy all day, you don't get bored, there are always things to look at. It's the first time I've gone and I loved it. I recommend it.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Excellent game. The remodeling was much better, more active and more daring. Dinosaurs are more similar and really scare you as you go. If you can get wet but not enough to use waterproof. The rows sometimes last up to 3 hours so you have to check the application.

(Original)
Excelente juego. Quedó mucho mejor la remodelación, más activa y más atrevida. Están más parecidos los dinosaurios y realmente te sacan un susto conforme avanzas. Si te puedes llegar a mojar pero no tanto como para usar impermeable. Las filas a veces duran hasta 3 horas así que hay que checar la aplicación.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Time>1624080443597</Time><name>Bobby Trav</name><Review>Saw Dr. Hatch as I found his office initially for a second opinion. Glad I did. He spent considerable time with me going over the options available and I did not feel rushed at all. He saved most of my tooth in question and it was totally painless which I did not fully expect. Saw hygienist Emily for a checkup and cleaning as well and she was super kind, gentle, thorough and gave me detailed information on my teeth along with preventative measures to help keep them in great shape. Went back again with my wife and daughter and had another positive visit with their dental needs. The staff in the office were friendly and accommodating. Dr. Hatch provided me with options another did not. That was important to me. The Rock & Roll music decor was an added bonus and unique to see!</Review>< rating>

<review>Great cleaning/ check up. Everyone was masked, temps taken, hand sanitizer everywhere. Monica did a great job cleaning my teeth and having Dr Hatch check everything over. Quick - in and out in less than an hour and time for lunch! Thanks for all you all do, great seeing everyone.

Oh, and I always love the music you play when I'm there!

Thank you again, Lisa.< /review></record>

<review>I would give zero stars but I CAN'T!! Don't ever go to this dental office! They are not accommodating to your needs at all! Not only did I pay more than $2k for them to fix my crown and Dr. Gupta did a horrible job that it broke in less than a year!! I asked them to fix it and they wanted to charge me another $2k to fix it!!

Today I rushed to my appt and my daughter's appt for A SIMPLE CLEANING, we got there a little passed their grace period of 15 mins...at 17 mins and they turned us away!!! Really 2 mins passed! Their office is all show and NO SUBSTANCE! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!! DON'T GO TO THIS OFFICE! THEY ARE HORRIBLE!!<//review><Rate>1</Rate><date>1622159019190</date>< user_id>

Recently moved to Scripps Ranch and needed a dentist closer than the one I'd been going to for 40 years. I was so pleased with the comprehensive, preventative approach to keeping my teeth healthy. The people are VERY helpful, professional and pleasant. I am delighted to have found my new dentist so close to my new home!< /review>

Our family is new to Scripps Rock Dental and ironically, the day after my teenager had his first cleaning there, he fell while running and cracked off a good bit of his front two teeth. Scripps Rock Dental was amazing! They got us in right away the next morning and got him all fixed up with a beautiful new smile just in time for him to leave for college. If I could give them 10 stars, I would!<//review>

Terrific, personalized customer service.  They go all out to maximize your insurance.  The hygienists are real pros, and the "Rock Dock" (Dr. Tony Hatcher) goes into as much depth as you desire to explain any additional work recommended.  and the three Dentists are all superb.  Can't say enough good things!!<//Review>

I've been a patient at Scripps Rock Dental for few years now. I have had the best experience with dental hygienists Brooke and Monica, and Dr. Gupta. They are friendly, thorough, and have great bedside manner. I hope to continue being their patient as long as my insurance allows it!< /Review>

<Text>I am a new patient because I wanted a dental office in Scripps Ranch and Scripps Rock came highly recommended. From my first phone contact, they were friendly, helpful and professional. The office is lovely with amazing equipment and my hygienist (Diane) was excellent, going over my full health and dental history. And then I met Dr. Hatch who also went over everything and explained our plan. I highly recommend this office.<//Text>< Pics>

Terrific staff and great dentist. State-of-the-art equipment, trust-worthy recommendations for any work needed, and excellent hygienists. Finding a good dentist is unusually difficult so Scripps Rock Dental is a hidden gem. They also offer a care plan which is better than most dental insurance plans out there.< /Review>

<review>I have a huge mouth full of veneers! AND..they tend to pop off. I had been to Dr. Gupta a few years back as she bonded my missing veneer. She is not my regular dentist, as I have a regular dentist...that I am done with...as he did not call me back to get my 2 cosmetic veneers bonded ASAP..over the last few days. Dr. Gupta looked after me yesterday. My veneers are old and I want a dentist I can trust to do cosmetic stuff. Dr. Gupta...was amazing...I am super claustrophobic...and she taught me how to wiggle my toes so I did not freak out!! I am in the market for a new dentist to re-do all my top veneers. I will contact her after this virus ends and we are back to some sense of normalcy!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>If you’re looking for a dentist in the Scripps Ranch and surrounding area, one who has your best interest at heart both physically and financially, look no more. Scripps Rock Dental, with the latest state-of-the-art equipment and Dr. Hatch at the helm, is the only place to go. His office is warm and inviting with your choice of coffees, music and videos. The office staff is friendly and efficient, ensuring that you are greeted and seen at the scheduled time..…. no waiting. The office is always decorated with the latest holiday theme, and between holidays you can enjoy Dr. Hatch’s collection of guitars and coffee table books of a great era. This is a dental office that you look forward to going to, and when returning for a visit it feels like going “home” again. Dr. Hatch is always upbeat, friendly and personally takes the time to patiently listen and understand his patients, addressing their concerns and discussing a treatment plan. No pressure. I have never seen him less than cheerful and always ready to welcome a new challenge. He is involved in the community and supports the local youth sports groups and causes. My family and I are happy that we have found a friendly and efficient dental office so close to home that we can trust and depend on for top notch dental care. Try them……I’m confident you will not be disappointed.</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbf99fc0235f15:0x56cd1d286f6a76bb< /Gmap_id></record>

I really appreciated my cleaning today by Diana, she's so thorough & professional!  I had my impression done for my retainer...Jenna made it so simple. I was impressed. Thank you!</Text>< user>

<time>1564460643807<//time><text>I hate the dentist, that being said I needed a lot of work done. I had recommendations from several friends. Many recommended Scripps Rock Dental. I have it a try and I was amazed. The employees really cared about their patients. They worked out a schedule for the work I needed to get done and had prices for everything up front. They looked over my coverage so my benefits were maximized and my out-of-pocket was minimized. They made my crown in house while I waited. The fit was perfect. I felt they really cared about me and my health. After the first visit I no longer had the dread about visiting the dentist that I had before.

Their location is just off the 15 freeway and Scripps Poway Parkway. They are very easy to get to.

Tip: There is a frozen yogurt shop in the same parking lot so you can get a cold treat after getting some work done! 8-)< /text>< rate>

The staff is always incredibly friendly, they're very punctual with appointments, and it's always great to be able to watch Netflix while getting a cleaning. Additionally, I love that they take up-close pictures of your teeth and show you where issues are so you don't just have to take their word for it. Top notch place!</text>

<review>They are super nice and go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable the whole time you are there. I have fibromyalgia and medication doesn't work well on me, but they always make sure I am completely comfortable before they start anything. I would definitely recommend them if you are scared to go. They will make you feel very comfortable.< /review>< response>

<Text>Let's preface this review mentioning the most difficult search for an available walk-in this morning... ...it was extreme.
Saving my morning with an available walk-in was just the start. From the receptionists to everyone behind the scenes, service was ABSOLUTELY LEGIT. Waiting for my dentist was not awkward since the hygienist was personable, down to earth, and made me feel relaxed. Also, my dentist is definitely easy to talk to and I really appreciate how much time he took to thoroughly examine and treat me!
Providing informative options while making me feel like a human being (instead of just another customer) are the cherries on top of this visit! Moving to California from Florida has some stinky challenges, but thankfully Scripps Rock Dental keeps my oral issues FRESH!
Also, the ambiance is the best, with a rock theme showcasing out of sight decor and a refreshments cafe that spoils you just right! Thanks you guys! I am looking forward to taking better care of my smile with you all!<//Text>< pictures>

It's my first time here and noticed all the staff are very courteous and I felt very welcome. The offices are clean and professional. In addition, I want to thank the entire staff for the outstanding attention and customer service. Specially thanks to Emily for doing a great job cleaning my teeth and Dr. Russell for dental recommendation. Highly recommend to everyone to try Scripps Rock Dental.<//Text>

Every time I go to Scripps Rock Dental. They make me feel like family. They are very professional and personable at the same time. The dental work is top notch and they have great follow-up. I have never had a better dentist in all my years. I have worked with 2 of the three dentists and all their assistants and could not ask for better treatment or more friendly people. Dr. Russell and Enza make a great team and do excellent crowns. Lesly and Jessica are awesome receptionist always friendly and attentive.</Review>

Diana was great and the "new patient" cleaning and exam was exceptional - very thorough and explanatory. Super comfortable, great music, even Netflix if you want, with the most personable and professional dentistry staff I've experienced in years. SO glad I found Scripps Rock Dental - they rock!< /Text>

Having been afraid of dentist's for over fifty years it is a welcome blessing to be in the presence of the people who work with Dr Hatch. When I come there I feel safe, comfortable, and relaxed.< /Text>< Pics>

I called Scripps Rock Dental for an emergency appointment and they fit me in within one hour! The staff is extremely nice and accommodating. Check in process was easy, Dr. Hatch was super careful and made sure I felt 100 % comfortable. After the x-rays and exam, he explained the problem and suggested a treatment plan. I would highly recommend Dr. Hatch and his staff.</text>

I have been seeing Dr. Tony Hatch for about two years now.  There is no one I would trust more with my dentistry needs.  He is incredibly thorough and very detailed oriented.  The work he has done for me is the best I have received in many, many years of seeing a variety of different dentists.  He is very personable and extremely easy to talk to.  He explains things in a way that I can understand. I think he and his staff are absolutely outstanding and highly recommend Scripps Rock Dental to anyone looking for a dentist.< /review>

@ScrippsRockDental you will always get excellent dental care. I love my dentist! The entire staff is friendly!  I have been going to them for the last couple of years. I have had cleanings and dental work and have received excellent dental care. I recommend them to anyone that is looking for a dentist that goes above and beyond.
Dr. Hatch, Dr. Gupta and Dr. Russell
Thanks For Everything

This is my dentist for a few years now. I trust all the three dentists there as well as the rest of the crew. Yesterday I had my regular check up and deep cleaning. Monica was my dental hygienist this time and she took care of my teeth just like she would do to her own teeth. She was so efficient that she almost put me to sleep; it was more like a gum massage therapy!  I feel so lucky to have found this dentist and they are in my neighbourhood!</review>

I traveled from NY with a few referrals from local friends and I’m so happy I did. In one day I got a smile I could be proud of. Dr.Hatch was patient and caring. He had the help of his assistant Enza who pays much attention to detail and was always concerned about my comfort. I later saw Monica who was my hygienist. I’ve never had a cleaning so through but gentle. I highly recommend this office!< /review>

<gmapID>0x80dbf99fc0235f15:0x56cd1d286f6a76bb<//gmapID><review>These people are great and they do really good work. My hygienist is very detailed and she really genuinely enjoys her work (both the job itself, and the people-aspect; she is very grounded and a great conversationalist). She articulates everything she's doing and is responsive to the slightest movements. She gave me a mouth rinse numbing agent so my guns wouldn't be as sensitive. The doctor also came in for an exam checkup and followed up on previous treatments, which was nice.

From 10 months ago: This was this best and most comfortable dental appointment I've ever experienced- the booking, forms, waiting room, staff, consultations with hygienist, doctor, and insurance/billing, cutting edge technology, screen sharing of work in real time, ambiance (decor, music, furniture)...

I'm actually looking forward to going back!</review><Response>None</Response><username>Sunshine Vekas< /username>< Date>

Dr. Hatch always exceeds my expectations. I had some minor bonding work done and it matched perfectly to my existing tooth. I'm not sure he was able to do it in record time, but it was done with perfection. He is one of the best dentist in San Diego. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have the perfect teeth that I have today. I also love the hometown feel of this dentist office. The staff is awesome!</Review>

Diana is a rock star! She is the best hygienist that my teeth have ever met. Truly she is the Queen of (dental) Clean! I thoroughly enjoyed our pleasant conversation and her deep cleaning of my teeth. As a mom of young kids, I'm used to taking care of everything for everyone but this morning I felt like I was well taken care of by very nice and professional people. Thanks, Scripps Rock Dental. See you in six months!<//review>

< review>
I've been on the road for 23 yrs and hardly ever have the time to see my regular dentist. Finding Scripps Rock Dental here in San Diego was quite fortuitous.  In the past, I've experienced varying levels of pain, with multiple dentists in various States. Since I've needed a deep periodontal cleaning for some time,  I made an initial appointment at Scripps Rock and was pleasantly surprised how professional and caring the staff could be. Brooke is a veritable Journeyman Anesthetic Artist - the Jackson Pollock of numbing: a layered approach with a gifted touch. It was the first time in over 12 years whereby I felt better after visiting the dentist than before I arrived.  Well done, Scripps Rock, well done.</review>

<Review>Enza has been helpful and friendly in helping me figure out my way around my Clear Correct teeth alignment trays (similar to Invisalign). She is gentle with the equipment while working in my mouth and encouraging of my progress. Dr. Gupta is very skilled and adept at assessing my teeth, making a treatment plan, and then executing the treatment plan. She communicates well and always lets me know about the next few steps of my treatment. She is very good at improving her patients' smiles.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I had my first visit to this practice a couple of weeks ago and it was a top shelf experience from beginning to end. The entire process leading up to the appointment (scheduling, patient information intake, insurance verification, etc.) was done quickly, professionally and pleasantly. During my visit, the front office was very nice, my hygienist was excellent and the dentist made me feel like I was in very good hands. I recommend them highly and will be using them as my regular dental office from here forward. Thanks Scripps Rock!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

My teeth cleaning experience was pleasant and informative that I had with Diana. I'm ready for my next six month appointment.
I love this office and all the people that work there. They are the best at what they do. They are all very friendly but also very professional. They always fully explain everything to me at the end of each visit. I highly recommend them to everyone.

I have to update my review because Scripps Rock Dental is the BEST.  I love everyone that works here. They are the most friendly, professional, and caring group of people. There are three Dentists that work in the office and I’ve used all three over the years I have been coming to this office. They all are super qualified in the lasted techniques and equipment.
The Dental Assistants, Enza and Jenna are great. They put you right at ease and are very concerned with your comfort.
It is always a pleasure dealing with Jackie after my dental work. She is such a sweet kind person. She takes her time explaining all options with you concerning your dental work and insurance concerns.</text>

Casey - who performed most of the work (cleaning) did superb job as did Jessica (reception). Highly recommend this dental office for cleaning - have to wait and see how other work there goes - but if it's anything like my visit today - it should be great!</Review>< pictures>

<review>had another great visit for a cleaning. I have dentist "anxiety" since being a child and everyone I have worked with at Scripps Rock Dental have been amazing and very friendly and gentle, but still getting the job done. I wanted to find a dental place when I moved to California and was very afraid that I wouldn't find a dentist office I could feel comfortable with and extend my annual cleaning to 2 year/3year cleanings...this wasn't the case. To any of you out there with "dental anxiety/fear" I 100% recommend this office. Great staff and looking forward to coming back for my next visit.< /review>< pics>

<text>We all came in the same day and the staff was consistently kind, quick, and skilled. Our sons first dentist appointment and he felt very comfortable. My wife and I both agreed after that their staff exude happiness and you can tell they are treated well by their employer. We've found a new dental home.<//text><rating>5</rating>< user>

I've been going to Dr. Hatch and his staff since he was just starting in the business.  I also have the experience of having been to many other dentists over the decades.  Simply stated, he is the best.  That rating is a combination of of the quality of their services, their staff and the office environment.  Parking and access are easy too.  All I can ask is - - - keep it up!</review>

But everyone in the office was so sweet and compassionate and really talked me through the process. You can really tell that everyone on staff - from the receptionists to the assistants to the billing staff - has an awareness of the procedures and a genuine care for their patients. My dentist, Dr. Gupta, is so fun a sweet. I love that I was able to go through 6 fillings in the past 3 weeks and all I had to worry about was what I wanted to watch on Netflix. Thank you to everyone there!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Scripps Rock Dental is number one in my book. The facility and equipment is state of the art. Dr. Hatch is professional and compassionate as well as personable. He is not afraid to refer his patient out when he encounters an issue in which he does not specialize. The staff is very knowledgeable and approachable as well. From the time you walk in until you leave, the service is almost spa like. The results obtained with Dr Hatch have been spectacular and I would highly recommend this practice<//text>

Weeks later, the cyst in my gums did not go away. It grew. They mis-diagnosed the problem. To their defense, they did refund my money, but I think they could’ve done better than only a refund. I think they could’ve also compensated for my time, the hassle, and medical risk of a mis-diagnosis. They should have known to refer me to an oral surgeon sooner rather than later, instead of a root canal specialist. In the wasted months, the cyst grew and I may wind up losing more than one tooth because of it.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>Scripps Rock Dental has THE ABSOLUTE BEST Dental Hygenist I have ever had~her name is Emily, and she is a consummate professional. Emily is very gentle, and she always cares how her patients feel while she is cleaning their teeth. I always look forward to my appointments with her because it is a great experience. If you are looking for a new dental office with a Dental Hygenist who is "top notch," go to Scripps Rock Dental.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Name>

<Text>My first visit to Scripps Rock Dental was such a refreshing experience. The staff was very friendly, and as someone who usually finds dental visits to be unpleasant, they made me feel at ease. I felt I was in good hands and was not uncomfortable at all. I was also well informed with the state of my teeth and any payment(s)/treatment(s) needed. I would definitely recommend this practice to my friends and family!<//Text><Rate>5</Rate>< time>

Praise and gratitude to Scripps Rock Dental for their professionalism and gentle care. I can't recommend them highly enough. From the front desk check in to Brooke and Dr. Russell, my anxiety of dental care is diminished. Thank you for providing an excellent dental experience.</Review>

Great staff! In my years of going to Scripps Rock Dental they've always been professional and as on top of things as you can get. They've got a great system for reminding you of your appointments and if you've got a company dental plan they make it I don't have to make any contact with your dental insurance provider. They even work things out with them so I pay as little out of pocket as possible. The place is always clean and welcoming. You can tell they take the customer experience very seriously. Will continue to have my teeth worked on at Scripps Rock for as long as I can.<//Review>

<Review>I recently was fitted for a nightguard and had a cleaning. All hands were superb! My hygienist was Diana and she did a great job. She was quick, too! The nightguard impressions were done by Enza, who was also fast and excellent. And of course, Jackie at the checkout is always upbeat and efficient. It almost makes me enjoy going to the dentist!! Seriously, the folks here are great.<//Review><Rating>5< /Rating><Time>1552598917473</Time><username>Thomas Wing< /username>< response>

<Text>After months of being in pain, my molar abscessed. Yikes! I was referred to Scripps Rock Dental and, from the first phone call, found help and relief. The front office is warm, skilled and friendly. Dr. Heather Russell patiently explained what needed to take place and listened carefully as I shared my concerns. She skillfully removed the tooth and prepped me for an implant. I'm so very grateful for Dr. Russell's expertise!! Thank you a million times for seeing me so quickly and helping me on the road to recovery.  I'll be back with my family!< /Text>< Name>

<review>I've never had this great of an experience on a dental office !  This place is the best !  Diana is awesome !

4th visit...
Diana was very attentive, courteous and friendly during my 2pm appointment. Asked how was my family doing and something personal that she remembers (from all the patients she treated, Im surprise she even remembers). She performed the cleaning thoroughly and didn't knick my gums (usually after lunch some hygienists gets sleepy and accidentally cut my gums). This would be my 4th cleaning and I'm always satisfied with her work.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dbf99fc0235f15:0x56cd1d286f6a76bb< /GmapID></record>

I never thought I would be excited to see the dentist. This place is great! I'm a techie so for me to say I'm impressed by the technology at this office means a lot. They have televisions on the ceiling so you can watch Netflix while they're working on you. They also have digital x-rays and cameras to take individual pictures of your teeth. You can manage your account online and you also get email reminders for appointments. Dr. Russell was very nice and gave me a comprehensive analysis of the overall state of my teeth and replaced an old filling that was starting to break down. I am happy I came here and I highly recommend Scripps Rock Dental.< /review>

Who would ever think to write a review on a dentist?    Well, due to the fact that every member of my family and my sisters family have all had the privilege of having outstanding dental cleanings, and phenomenal dental work by Dr. Hatch and his staff, I feel compelled to do so.

We have 4 grown kids and not one of them grumble about going to the dentist.  Hmmmmmm..... Could it be that great rock and roll music they play (and Dr. Hatch even sings when he works) or is it the calm talent they all have?

I say a little bit of both...   The family agrees that Scripps Rock Dental.... "ROCKS"!

Dr. Gupta was so helpful with my son when he broke his tooth at a basketball game.....she said come on in, I will work late!   fantastic!

Now me,   ... well years ago I decided that  the numbing shot called Novocaine was overrated, and when I first went to see Dr. Hatch I pleaded with him to allow me to do   my fillings and crowns without the numbing.   He said ..."Ok".  The reality..... It takes a lot of patience to be patient with a patient like me!   He has the skill to calmly do the work, any of you that aren't into the fat face syndrome after the dentist, I would highly recommend  giving it a try!

We will continue to refer anyone that asks.... We did move away from scripps and continue to drive back...they are all just that good!

Oh,   Natalie and Kate and Catherine are fantastic at handling all the insurance details too!  Plus they are always so friendly!

Thanks to all at Scripps Rock!< /text>

Since retiring, I wanted a dentist closer to home so took advantage of the first-time client promotion at Scripps Rock Dental.  I was so impressed with their attentiveness and professionalism, in addition to making me feel completely welcomed.  The staff is excellent (Hygenist Rebecca was very informative and took good care of me).  I was impressed with Dr. Hatch's credentials and photos of his work. I'll be returning for a crown in a week.  Really pleased to have found such a quality dental office so close to home!</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Very kind and gentle staff. you can tell they are very well trained in both dentistry and customer service. Dr Hatch makes the experience less torturous than most of my other dental procedures lol and by that I mean they make sure you're comfortable and let you watch tv, Netflix, listen to music, etc to distract you if you're deathly afraid of the dentist like I am. He's also very nice and funny and the assistants are very helpful. the whole place is cool with a rock and roll type theme which you see right when you enter the lobby. large selection of coffees and teas while you wait of you're early and the receptionists could not be more sweet and helpful. I haven't had the pleasure of working with Dr. Gupta yet but im sure she's just as great as Dr. Hatch. I'll never go to another dentist again as long as Scripps rock dental is in business :)<//Review>< pics>

Amanda Winter is very thorough and extremely knowledgeable about the refinancing process. She provided sound advice to get us the best rate and closing costs for our situation.  It was a quick and smooth process.  Amanda is a valuable asset to Finance of America Mortgage! I would highly recommend Amanda to anyone who is either refinancing or purchasing a new home.<//Review>

I would text them my random questions that would pop up and they got back to me instantly, every single time. We will definitely be using Finance of America for our second home! :)</text>

Michelle is an absolute professional.  Not only does she know the ins and outs of the mortgage business, she really cares about her clients and helps them make decisions that are in their best interests.  She is extremely detailed and follows thru on what needs to happen in a timely manner.  This is our second time working with her and we won’t hesitate to work with her again.</Review>

We just closed on a refinance and John Ussery made the entire experience easy. He kept us updated throughout the process, and he responded to every email almost immediately. John was the broker on our original loan and we did not hesitate to contact him again when it was time to refinance. He is a great communicator and I highly recommend working with him.< /Review>

New home buyer ignorance and intimidation? He nailed it. First refi? Refi for my 90yr old parents? 2nd refi? He was patient and kind and informative and knowledgeable and efficient each and every time. He gives me the information and helps me make informed decisions.

Lyle Innocent is the best lender to work with.  We have been dealing with lenders for 40 years and Lyle is by far the most efficient and realistic agent we have dealt with.  We knew where we were in the process at every step.<//text>

<review>Stacey is exceptional at what she does and it’s the reason she’s been doing it for a while now. I constantly hear from my clients about how other lenders easily declined them service and turn them away, or advised them not to buy In today’s market. But Stacey, and her amazing team, has not once turned any of my clients away. Her process of having everyone apply, providing guidance and a plan of action, and then following up and nurturing them to where they need to be is extremely efficient.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>John made my home buying experience as stress free as possible. I always felt like I was well informed to make my decisions. He was always readily available to answer any questions of mine as well. Also, he was able to close my loan quickly to get us in! I appreciate all his time and patience with me and my family. Thank you for a great experience!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Amazingly easy experience, Lyle is the man. Shaved hundreds off my mortgage and didn't try to push cash out or anybody the other options available. Some people will complain about having to provide too many documents this and prove that... You are financing hundreds of thousands of dollars...shut up and do it. Great company, great people, thanks for everything.</Text>

Rusty is about the relationship versus just the transaction.  His care and attention to detail exceeds my client's expectations as well as mine.  Rusty takes the time to review our clients plan and future goals.  He is always in communication with all the steps along the way.  Rusty is the BEST!!!<//Text>

Amanda and her team did an amazing job with getting my approval and funding during the height of the quarantine. Despite the obstacles that they had to overcome due to other companies being short-staffed or closed I never worried whether or not my purchase was going to go through.  Again, thanks a lot to Amanda and Finance of America for a great experience!<//text>

Rusty is the best! He has not only served many of my real estate clients with the utmost knowledge and professionalism, but I have personally used him for my own home loan to experience first hand his diligent service. And his assistant, Fran, is the kindest most wonderful communicator too. My team and I look forward to a continued relationship with this group!<//Text>

John Ussery sets the bar high for all other mortgage advisors to try and climb over. Most can only wish to be as exceptional as he is. He is a genuine professional who has a strong knowledge of the lending marketplace at any given time. He is a good communicator and he works hard, day in and day out -- all the way to the finish line, and it shows. It is a pleasure to have John Ussery involved in any of my real estate transactions.< /Review>

<text>I've worked with Shannon twice now - first for my original home loan, and then for my re-fi. Her customer service is EXCELLENT and UNBEATABLE. She usually answers my phone calls (once even when she was vacation overseas), and if she doesn't answer, she calls back and/or responds within hours.  I really liked the weekly automated emails that let me know exactly where I am in the loan process, and documentation needed. HIGHLY RECOMMEND her and her awesome team!<//text><username>Joel Bueno<//username><response>None< /response>< pictures>

Worked with Erica Leonard as our Mortgage Advisor for the purchase of our first home and completely lucked out. Erica clearly communicated and did a great job at keeping things as simple as they needed to be to ensure we knew what was going on. There was never a point where my wife and I didn’t know where things were at or what the next steps would be. If any additional documentation was needed, Erica let us know immediately. 10/10 would recommend Erica.< /Text>

Working with John is truly a blessing he explained every step of the way so I knew what to expect "no surprises" , returned calls immediately no matter if after hours or weekend if he could not answer txt right away. He managed to push my loan through in 25 days even with these crazy times we are going through "Carona Virus" there were several obstacles he helped us maneuver through and managed to make our desired closing date "my birthday. John and his staff are truly ROCKSTARS !!!!!< /Text>

Eric and his team are true professionals ! The loan process was smooth and as effortless, as it could be. I would highly recommend Erik and Finance of America Mortgage. We are in our forever home and Erik and his team were a Giant part. If we have finance needs in the future you can be sure Erik will get the call !</text>

I worked with Michelle at Finance of America Mortgage and all I can say is that Michelle was able to help me become a first time home buyer even with my chapter 13. The process took a little longer because of my chapter 13 but at the end it was worth it. I highly recommend the services of Michelle at finance of america mortgage.< /review>

No surprises (except closing faster and cheaper than expected)! 21 day close on a conventional, competitive rate, answered all my questions, SUPER easy process. He even personally called the title company to call them on the carpet for dragging their feet! Great service!
He's so good, that's why we've bought through him TWICE! Thank you Michael and Dawn!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Samantha and her team are truly the best! She is so friendly and helpful and was never bothered by all of my crazy questions during the process of buying our first home. She made everything easy. Her team was friendly and efficient and would highly recommend to anyone buying a home.< /Text>

I was closing out my loan and I had to close later than schedule because of my wire transfer not coming in on time as of 02/01/2019.  So, I was already stressed out.  On 02/04/2019, I receive a phone call from Heather Peralta stating that I never submitted docs for the bank that I was trying to pull my funds from.  However, I submitted the bank account activity in 12/2018.  Heather admitted in her e-mail that she assumed that I was going to use my Chase account because I had enough funds.  But, the thing is I had more funds in my other account.  So, now, I had to drop everything to close on 02/04/2019.  I was faxing documents to Heather like crazy, even into my lunch break!  Heather didn't even know that I had two accounts from the bank that I was trying to pull my funds.  One account was closed.  She didn't even know that and was asking for statement on the closed account when there was another account that was opened.  I had to tell her that!  She just asked for all the documents even the ones that I already submitted.  When I told her that I already submitted that she responded in her e-mail, "Okay, maybe we don't need that."  She was asking for documents that I submitted in 03/2018 and 09/2018 in 12/2018!  It was terrible working with her!
So, I contacted the cooperate office and Kathy Semon responded.  She said she was going to do an investigation.  She e-mailed me saying that she was concluding that I closed on 02/04/2019 because my wire transfer did not come in on time.   However, I did not make a statement that I closed on 02/04/2019 because of Heather.  I was talking about Heather being unorganized that she caused me more unnecessary stress.  Secondly, granted that my wire transfer came in late, however, had I not dropped everything and jump on it to fax everything over to Heather, I would not have been able to close even on 02/04/2019.  Lastly, why does my wire transfer coming in late have anything to do with Heather not being on top of her job and asking for documents that I submitted nine months ago?  I believe had Semon done her investigation properly, she should have known that Heather only received the docs on 02/04/2019 which continued into my lunch break.  How does Heather not being able to provide proper customer service because she was not on top of her job have anything to do with my wire transfer not coming in on time?  I would never want to work with Fiance of America Mortgage again.</text>

The ladies here are super nice.  Always have a smile and have awesome customer service.  I like the atmosphere.  Since the last time I was there, there is much improvement on the organization and cleanliness of the place.  Will definitely recommend if you need plates, cups and cutlery in bulk.  They have all kind of restaurant items. Overall it's a nice place to shop.</Review>

The best answer I can give whenever people ask me what the heck CC&C is I always answer, "It's the poor man's Costco." This is an overly-simplified answer, of course. CC&C is much more than that; it's also a restaurant/party supply store as well. Here's my Top 6 list of favorite things at CC&C:

1) They have the most extensive collection of Torani syrup (they also sell the pumps, too!) that I've ever seen; including quite a few sugar-free varities. If Torani makes it, they have it!

2) Great selection & prices on charcoal briquettes. They have the standard Kingsford, and also carry huge bags of Mesquite charcoal.

3) Their restaurant/kitchen supply area is fantastic. The have everything you could want and then some. From basics like cutting boards and tongs to HUGE stock pots that you could simmer a small hippo in!

4) Nice selection of Mexican and Asian candies and treats. My favorites are the "Yan Yan" and the "Hello Panda" cookies.

5) Nice selection of hot sauces, dried chiles and spices. As someone who likes to add a little "taste" in their cooking, this place is the cure.

6) Great selection of party supplies at terrific prices; they have just about everything you could need to throw a children's party, fiesta or luau.

There's much more than what I've listed above, but you'll just have to go in for yourself and see. Couple all of the above with friendly customer service and you've got a hidden shopping gem in the heart of Ghetto Glen.</text>

I've gone to this place about three times now in the daytime and it's been closed with bars around the windows and doors. Not sure if it's a temporary closure or a permanent closure but as of now this place is closed

5/25/21 - Update !  - There is a sign in the window indicating they will be reopening in the future, but there's no ETA provided.</review>

Idk if it's the ice cream or the rude customer service but something wasnt like I remebered. The 3 children working here were to busy asking "anything else". No smiles or anything. I'll definitely be taking my ice cream cravings somewhere else next time.< /text>

<text>Walked in the store, had one person in front of us. They finished and both employees walked away from us, for 5 minutes we didnt get service standing in the store empty. Someone else walked in and straight to the counter to get a obviously pre ordered cake and walked out with his items. We left due to lack of acknowledgement we were even patrons in the establishment.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

The parking is free, but tricky. Very tight spaces and low maneuverability. The ice cream offerings are standard Baskin Robbins.< /Review>

<Text>I ordered online with my account. They make it easy to find popular choices from their menu or to customize and create your own pizza the way you want. It is ready quickly and then put into a large holding oven that is secured by a PIN, which they send you your code so you can walk into the store and get your order. I got a thin crust with the toppings I wanted, a 6 piece of buffalo wings, and an order of crazy bread. Everything was good and hot. The prices are reasonable. Thanks Little Caesars! 😃</Text><Resp>None</Resp>< user_id>

Little ceasar pizza one of the better fast food pizza parlors. I prefer it over domino's or pizza hut because the dough tastes better. I am also old school all I want is cheese and theirs is not greasy. Also their square pie (deep dish) reminds me of Sicilian style from back on the east coast. This site does have the pizza portal so your pie stay hot till you pick it up. I only gave 3 stars because of location especially at night it is not the best place to be. Otherwise I would give it  5 stars for the food is good, fast service and the staff friendly.</text>

Just wish they had a door that opened automatically. Either u open it urself and tip ur pizza over or someone opens it for u which not many do. And area looks dirty, many hobos standing around bugging people for money. I can only imagine how dirty the inside must be.< /Text>

<review>They have poor health standards during the quarantine. There is a sign in their lobby that says something like, "Only three people can be in the lobby at a time." There were more than three people in the lobby most of the time while I was outside their building, waiting for my turn to step inside. Even after I asked an employee if it is allowed for more than 3 people to be in the lobby, they said no, and continued to let more than 3 people in the lobby. They also have a sign that says something like, "No mask, no service." They served people without masks on. One employee also did not wear their mask over their nose, and that is not the correct way to wear the mask. This place is dangerous.< /review>< Pictures>

Staff is awesome at this location! Pizza is ALWAYS HOT and DELICIOUS!! Crazy Bread ALWAYS AMAZING! Thank you for the great job !!
**Quick note for Management** Every employee I have encountered here has been extremely polite and helpful. I wanted to specifically point out the fact that the staff always appears in control, they seem to communicate very well with one another and each member is doing SOMEthing .. meaning no one is just standing around... a MILLION KUDOS to you guys!</Review>

<Review>Ordered on a sunday through their app, for pick up. 2 pepperoni,  1 Hawaiian,  1 deep dish, 1 wings, Italian bread and crazy bread. I was out the door and in my car pretty quick and to make sure, I double checked my ordered and realized they forgot my wings, I went in with receipt and ready to show them the back of my car where the food was if they needed to verify I indeed did not have them. She looked at receipt asked me what kind and found them no problem. 👍</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dcd650240ed8cd:0x34bf0d1b5aeb0a9f<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I won't complain about the crowd. They make something that can generously be called pizza, and sell it cheap. That means they'll be busy around dinner time. What I will complain about us that my online order placed over two hours ahead was over fifteen minutes late.<//Text>< pics>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>This place is fine. I mean, it's Little Caesars. It's fast-food pizza and if you expect anything more than that then you should rethink your life choices. If you're in a hurry and need pizza fast, this is your place. Their pizza is perfectly fine and tasty. Their non-regular items, like the bacon deep-dish, are actually really good. I wish they would have them year-round.

I just tried their Hawaiian pizza for the first time because usually I just get a hot-n-ready pepperoni, and I really liked that too. I think it actually think it can rival some of the other major chains as well.

Don't be afraid to mix it up sometimes.

The only reason to avoid this particular location would be because it is a transient hub and 9 times out of 10 you're guaranteed to be asked for changed by some dudes just hanging out outside.< /text>< Pictures>

Horrible costumer service.  11/8/19 around 4:30pm I called to place my order and the way she answer the phone was really unprofessional. “What do you want to order”??? Really! She told me it would take .20 minutes for my food to be ready. I got there and still had to wait more time cause my order wasn’t ready. Food is good it’s just the service they need more training or at least management on site.< /text>

When you just want a taste of pizza, it's an okay place. Ordered on line used the quick pick up using scanner and out the door in a jif. The strip mall is run down with homeless lying outside sleeping.<//Text>

<text>Always decent,  but never a wow.  Good pizza for the price.  Often a wait for anything special including hawaiian.  Always a good fall back pizza place, but never a favorite.  Like that there's garlic butter sauce too.<//text>< pictures>

<userid>118008357106100701785</userid><review>Nothing special here. Strictly average in all aspects. What prevents a higher score is their location. Homeless are EVERYWHERE at this complex. It is not uncommon to watch a drug deal going down outside while you are getting your pizza.  If you have the nerve to order anything except a quick and ready pizza, you may very well find yourself waiting a very long time. A staff here at 10 to give much more priority to the quick and ready pizzas then they do any special orders. I have never had a special order pizza here that I had to wait any less than 45 minutes. It is for these reasons that I can give this place no more than two stars.</review><name>J M Atchley<//name><rating>2<//rating>< pictures>

They put me on hold on the phone for 15 minutes and Once I went in and saw it was not packed, is when I had a problem with it. And they still made me wait 15 minutes for my order. Not a good place to call when you want your order ready to pick it up.<//text>

It's on State College in a run down strip mall.  It's the fast food equivalent for pizza.

< review>
It isnt those you choose topping like most family owned shops when you want atrichoke, it isnt the advertised perfection like others offer with cheese stuffed or what not. However bang for the buck is 5 stars to me! Id wait 45 minutes for a delivery from others or 20 minutes wait instore from other places. For the price its good and i would rather pay the same price then have to cook it myself for less taste! Keep rockin it! Marketing is marketing and has nothing to do with the people doing the job! I posted this due to the negatives ive seen. If its that bad then why did you come back? Support to middle man making the stuff we to lazy to make ourselfs! Thank you guys and gals, you the working force to our joy!</review>

<text>Crust bubbles all over that are not covered with cheese. For once I would like to get a cheese pizza that looks like their picture does instead of one that has half the cheese and crust bubbles all over with no cheese on them. It happens a lot and I get almost every weekend but moving on to a new pizza place, tired of half the cheese and dry crust bubbles every time. I have a pic if you want to see it. Why don't you make them to look like the picture nice and cheesy and no crust bubbles.<//text>< Pics>
