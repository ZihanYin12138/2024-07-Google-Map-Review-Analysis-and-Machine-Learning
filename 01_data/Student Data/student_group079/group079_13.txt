This restaurant is the one I like best. I eat in many restaurants but to this restaurant I go the most. The crew is very friendly and the cooking they serve is so tasty. I never miss an opportunity to have a nice dinner in this place. Highly recommended.</review>

They skimp on the Turkey meat..and 8 out of 10 times the bread is stale
They used to take pride in their product,but now just rush you out and the sand which makers are usually in a bad mood. Togo’s used to be the best sandwich in town..not anymore</review>

<review>TOGO’S makes delicious food; this location is touch and go. Their new system is efficient when Brandon is on the register, but otherwise quite ineffective. The staff seem to struggle with following health codes with hair dangling, unclean clothing, and untucked shirts. However, the restaurant is exceptionally clean and spacious—as far as TOGO’S goes.  TODAY:  The receipt on my order said “12: 02p,” but I didn’t receive my salad until 12:22p. I watched the manager make my salad. He is a taller gentleman, so every time he reached for an item I watched his untucked shirt fall and rest in my salad. I mentioned this sanitation issue while he made my salad and then specifically told him that I watched his shirt go in my food multiple times. He asked if I wanted him to remake the salad, but because I waited so long for the salad I told him “I would prefer if you just tucked in your shirt, so you’re not dipping your shirt in everyone else’s food.” He rolled his eyes and resumed making other people’s food with his shirt flopping into sandwiches and salads. I recognize the generic response will be “see you next time,” but I honestly don’t know if I’m going to return to this location.<//review><Rate>2</Rate>< GmapID>

My friends, Togo's is a long-established restaurant sandwich chain that has been around for quite a while now. However, it never gets old and I am consistently impressed by how they can deliver a fantastic sandwich experience time in and out over and over again. It seems to me that they rarely ever waiver from the quality of their sandwich and the formula that they have landed upon in terms of quality of meat, amount of veggies, size of bread etc is in an age old proven composition that never fails to satisfy. Treat yourself to a Togo's sandwich and I'm sure he'll return for more.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><review>I give this place a solid 5. Customer service was absolutely great. I was in line and each customer was being addressed as smoothly as possible. When my turn came up, I was greeted with a smile and my sandwich was briskly made. The manager handled everything with ease and great care. The sandwich tasted excellent. And they have one of those new automated soda machines which is a great plus. Employess seemed like they were attentive and enjoyed the work. My experience was so good I even came back a second time just to absorb the atmosphere of the shop. All I bought was a drink and a brownie but it was well worth the visit. I am definitely planning on going back, forget Subway.< /review>< pictures>

I am very unhappy with the service and product I received today.
I asked for a simple request for my sub,  and instead I was given a look by the woman making my sub as if I was wasting her time.
Once I received my sub I left. I should have looked at the sandwich before leaving the store .  LOOK AT YOUR SANDWICH BEFORE LEAVING.  So that they can fix any mistakes before you leave.

I'm leaving this nasty review along with complaining to management in the morning. If you can avoid this Togo's location please do so. You will save yourself money and time.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< UserId.>

This place used to be good until they changed their ordering process. Now you have to order everything at once on a machine that hyperly prints out orders to the sandwich workers before you've even finished choosing your toppings. I won't be going to Togos again despite over a decade of patronage.< /Review>

<review>I recieved an email for free birthday togos sandwich and was pretty stoked. This is another hit or miss place for me though and this last time was a miss for me. I ordered a chiken salad sandwich and was surprised when I got home to find that my sandwich had more bread than salad. 3 stars are for the mediocre customer service, mind you this was on a monday afternoon not busy at all. and for the free meal deserves my rating of 3 stars. the fact that there was hardly any chiken salad and mainly bread made me deduct two stars. Im just thankful that even though the sandwich was meager, it was still free. Cause had I paid, well that would be another story lol</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>If you're looking for customer service you're in the right place, Marlene was such a great help. I came in with a needle tension problem that two other shops couldn't help me figure out. I was prepared to look into buying a new sewing machine or been charged for replacement parts. Marlene sat me down and educated me on what was causing the issue and how to prevent it in the future. I really wish I could have paid her for her time and service, but she wouldn't accept. Next time I need supplies of any kind, I will continue to shop here.< /review><name>Michelle Galich<//name><resp>None</resp><Rating>5<//Rating><user_id>101696216658972859937</user_id>< gmap_id>

<Review>Finally upgraded and got the Industrial sewing machine! Highly Recommend this place for all of your sewing and embroidery needs. Many new and used machines to choose from. I found joseph to be very helpful and willing to help me with my questions and lack of knowledge. I also found many useful tutorials on the website. Happy with the purchase of my first Juki and glad this is the place I got it from. I’ll be back for more! Good Customer service goes a long way!<//Review>< pictures>

We were looking for a sewing machine for my daughters bday. We actually tried to order one from back east as that’s all I could find. The place was dragging their feet on charging me. I called back two days in a row and still nothing. I just wanted the receipt to put in a bday card. After 3 days with no charge I canceled and found this place. Joseph was really nice and knowledgeable. Spent some time on the phone with me explaining options and why. I ended up buying the machine from them over the phone. I knew we wouldn’t have it in time but he knew I just wanted the receipt. He went above and beyond and sent us these photos. My daughter noticed the card with her name on it! It went so much further than just a receipt and some internet pics. A1 customer service! Would highly recommend<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Talk about OG customer service!  I came in to have an old sewing machine serviced and it cost me $63.  Joseph, the mechanic, called me up and asked me what I wanted to sew with, essentially setting it up so it could sew denim.  He was honest, saying it would work and it might be a bit much for the machine to handle but to take it easy while sewing such material, as it required more torque and a slower rate to sew denim.  I was promptly  called up a few days latter to pickup the machine. I picked it up, took it home and didn't bother to ask how to thread the bobbin or the needle, thinking I could figure it out.  Steven, his Joseph's brother was there and was very kind when I picked it up.  However, what floored me was when I came back several days latter with my sewing machine.  It was Monday or Tuesday, Joseph and the other employees were swamped with phone calls and customers.  He asked me what I needed and I told him I didn't know how to thread the bobbin.  "Bring it in and take it back here," he said.  Ten or 15 minutes later he happily sat down with me and showed me how to thread the bobbin by explaining how to set the tension on the thread and screw.  Without flinching or a sign of frustration his explanation was great and the best you could ask for as a newbie to sewing machines.  Thanks Joseph and ABC Sewing!  Stay cool and local!.</text>< Pics>

Awesome! Joseph was so friendly and helpful. He took time out of his busy day to walk me through what I was doing wrong on my entry level brother sewing machine, and explained the basics of the inter workings. He even set my machine up and grabbed scrap material to give me a basic tutorial. I highly recommend this establishment. I like it so much, I'm signing up for their classes.<//Review>

He quickly located some Juki parts that I needed and got them ordered. Then he went on a hunt for some hard to find needles for an old Adler, and hunt he did and was able to locate again what I needed. I am very pleased. Steve's follow ups were thorough and fast. His website and ordering system are state of the art too. If ever I am in need of sewing supplies I know who to call. Thank you for your superior service!< /review><gmap_id>0x80c2c7df478814eb:0x316fec9a577a5f7<//gmap_id><rate>5<//rate>< name>

My husband bought me a Juki ( for leather work...and I don't know how to sew really) and the helpful technicians and Joseph made sure I knew how to do all the basic stuff on my machine...right down to the right needles and thread for what I do...btw ..I didn't even buy the machine from them, but will upgrade from them in the future!

Isaac is awesome. He repaired my car the day and time we agreed, then my daughter's car finding out that the problem was something completely different. He ordered an expensive part yet he told us it was something minor and gave us the refund of the part. Rare for a mechanic to be this honest. He is the best. I recommend this place to anyone plus his wife and daughter are so sweet and polite with the customers. Overall service and staff are beyond my expectations.<//Review>

I came in hopeful and confident that the reviews on google were right about  this place, instead it was a complete letdown. I was told my car would be in good hands so I left and walked to the nearest restaurant to give the mechanic some time to check my car. 3 1/2 hours later I come back  and nothing has been done. As soon as the mechanic sees me, thats  when he started calling for the parts that I had initially told him was what my car needed. He told me he would call me the next day as soon as the parts came, instead I called him to check on any updates and he said he would call me once they arrived. He never did call me after telling  me that he would do everything possible to get the bolts, because thats all it was, 2 missing bolts. What a letdown  and waste of my time.< /Review>

Excelent service. Quick to respond and follow up. Clearly explained and broke down cost for me and provided me options. Great customer service.

Sidenote: love that they offer discount when paying cash, avoided $5 fee. He gave me heads up before when I first brought in car. also did me favor of staying open a little extra for me so I could have time to pick up car.</review>

<review>brought my car to install a resonator and exhaust, my existing exhaust piping is 3 inches,  base on the work they performed looks like they didn't have 3 inches pipe available so they reduce the en to 2.5 inches. but they did not mention anything about it to me until i too my car for service to another shop and they were able to see the bad work done on my car.
i'm so disappointed about them and glad that my car didn't break.
please don't trust this business.</review>< name>

First time went there with my 2,kids. They ask you a lot of questions. First name, last name, phone number, full address, and many more. I wasn’t comfortable with with all those questions. They insist to get all those answers.
They did a terrible haircut.
I am still browsing to find a great barber shop.<//Review>

Service is good, but got a coupon from Great Clips and after the hair cut while paying system had some issues and didn't honored the coupon. Not only to me it happened to lot of other customers. Please fix the error.< /review>

<Text>COVID restrictions in place but still able to get a good haircut. Now I don't get any extravagant haircut so if you need something advanced, I cant speak to that but if you need a quick trim then this is your place. Also cheap, dont have to pay $60+.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I started coming here when it opened last year and enjoyed the service at first - rarely a line, good hair cuts that didn't take too long. In the past year, however, I've had very mediocre experiences. I come about every two months and each time it has been someone I've never seen before (lots of turnover I assume). The experience differs greatly. Sometimes it's fine. Sometimes it's really bad. I got a bad haircut once and had to come back the next day and explain to another employee that I just wanted it fixed. She did fix it for free and I was happy, I came back two months later as I had promised. A couple days ago, I came in for my haircut and got another (new, I assume) employee. She seems very reluctant and worked slowly, like she had never cut hair before. My confidence in her waned as time went on. I have short hair and just needed a high fade, something that should be very simple. The haircut too 45 minutes - way too long for a simple haircut. One side wasn't faded, I asked her to fade it and she just cut that side higher than the other. I can notice the difference in the mirror easily. While it's not the end of the world, I can't believe I paid $20 for a bad haircut. I don't think I'm coming back.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>I went to this place today to trim my hair. I told the old Asian lady to just cut straight with the amount I showed with my fingers. After I took off my glasses, she started chopping my hair unevenly! I looked horrible. The Asian old lady cut my hair very unevenly from the back without even asking me, while I told her very clearly not to cut the hairs that are mid of the skull! Just cut the hair that are hanging on the shoulders! When I told her my concern she started argument! Manager was nice and tried her best to fix my hair. Unfortunately she couldn't fix much as the old fart already ruined my hair by cutting the hair too short! I will not go back there again. After I showed my hair to my family, my husband and kids decided to never go back there again.This place might be ok for kids and men's hair cut but if you are a woman please don't go here unless u want to look like a scarecrow!!! I seem two Asian ladies working here and both had problem with the customers. Both don't know how to cut the hair evenly! Avoid this place. Worst experience here. If you are by chance here, ask the black lady who is the manager to cut your hair. She is the only person who knows how to do the job. Both the Asian women does awful job. I saw the other Asian lady cut a boys hair while one side had more hair than the other side of the head! That young Asian lady can't even cut a kids hair properly!< /Review>< Rate>

<Text>Great haircut. My hair is a pain as I need mine scissor cut and she spent the time and did an awesome job!!!!!!!< /Text></record></dataset><record>
< text>
I took my 8 yr old son here for hair cut. I noticed  tools they used were not clean and had lot of hair on them, I was hesitant to ask to clean because of my shy personality. I only wished for safe haircut. When we walked out, I noticed this cut on left ear and felt deeply hurt. Went back into store and I vent out my feelings though I am conflict avoiding person since this happened to my kid. The lady said sorry and helped with bandaid. But that’s not the point, I wanted to have hair cut for my kid in safe setting but the result was quite opposite. I will not forget or hesitate to check their tools before they use it on me or my kids for cleanliness and also gently remind them to do haircut carefully. Today I’m very disappointed and not feeling good.< /text>

<review>I gone to this newly opened shop and had terrible experience having bad haircut.
These people don’t know how to cut hair. Very poor service. They even don’t have anyone on the front counter and two different people ask same information to the client. Very unorganized and total chaotic place. Check in process is mess.
Will NEVER go again.< /review>< Pics>

Stay away from this place.  They love to waste your time.  I will never go back to this place again.  Even though you wait patiently for 1 hour and my turn, somebody can come in after you and they will take that person.

Called  Great Clips at the front and she told me I didn't need to make an appointment and to just show up. I got there ,she taken details ,my name shown on screen as 4th member and thoight check-in is done, After 1 hour , excited it's my turn but suddenly 2 guys came up and they taken that person. Again my turn went to 3rd place.When I asked they said online check-in. They should have inform me beofre itself about the process

When I asked ,they said don't know about check- in process. Better inform any walk-in customers that online check-in should be done,other othe u would end up waiting for hours.

Also train the employees about  check-in

<text>Oliver's is expensive but the international isle is on point. They have Mars candy bars in the british section. The one thing they need to get is hot lime relish for the Indian cuisine. Patak to be exact. Other than that I enjoy my visits there. On a sad note I was disheartened by noticing that some of the businesses had closed. My heart goes out to them.< /text><gmap_id>0x80843de326781e09:0xec74c9e7359975ca< /gmap_id>< Resp>

Windsor, in general, offers a pleasant shopping and dining experience that is predictable, unpretentious, and affordable. Bell Village  close to the Green, Interstate 101, and trails for biking and walking provides Groceries, gifts and services and different levels of dining.<//review>

My car was hit while parked and my boyfriend and I looked around a few shops and none convinced us until we came across Caliber Collision.  Their work was amazing and my car came out looking great. The paint job matched. Thank you Caliber Collision for making my car look amazing again.  If you're in need of a shop this one is the ONE !!!!< /review>

< Review>
My Honda was damaged on two different occasions when run into while parked on the street. Both times I had it repaired at Caliber Collision on 17th Street in Costa Mesa. (2nd time last week). On both occasions I was extremely pleased with their friendly helpful demeanor and their expert repairs of my car. I was especially pleased with their General Manager Tzoc Ortiz as he carefully explained the damage and the needed repairs...and it all made for a very easy process for me...they even drove my car home at no added expense. I HIGHLY recommended them. You too will be delighted with their service.< /Review>

<review>I'm normally very skeptic of any car repair shop because of their upsell tactics.
Jorge Barajas and Tizoc Ortiz at Caliber Collision were amazing, they explained the process for every service I wanted. I felt they were extremely honest, which is hard to find these days. I would recommend bring your car to Jorge and Tizco at Caliber Collision for all your automotive repairs.< /review><gmapID>0x80dd207015e8cea9:0x5816963a0b4201d8< /gmapID></record>

<Text>If you are looking for a reliable, honestly run auto body shop, look no further. Tizok and his crew are hardworking and make you feel like you are one of the family. I don’t know about you but I want to be taken care of like I’m family rather than just be another number. They are willing to work towards the best option for their customers. I ended up paying out of pocket, which was little more than what I would have had to pay for my deductible, on top of increased rates.
The actual process of getting my car fixed was just as painless. One day to swing by and match the paints so they could prep the pre-ordered parts, and another to install. Easy peasy. They even spot treated a couple of parking lot door dings for me! (Upon my request) Don’t just assume they are going to read your mind and do it.

Bottom line is, if you want a stellar experience, quality of people and workmanship: COME ON DOWN.</Text>< user>

Really good experience from start to end! One little bump at the end when we received the automated text that the car was ready and after we returned the rental car the next morning and were on the way to pick up the car We got a call that it wasn’t ready until later afternoon. Very inconvenient for us and totally avoidable.< /Text>

This is the 3rd time that I have brought a vehicle to this location.  Each and every time, work has been completed within the timeframe and budget of the original estimate.  The staff, both on the phone and in the front office greeted my husband and me warmly and got us quickly transferred to or into the office of the people that we needed to talk to, or see to get our needs met.  The manager Tizoc Ortiz is highly knowledgeable about all aspects of the work that was done on our vehicles, which was refreshing compared to other body shops.  When the last and final look at your vehicle is completed by someone who can spot the smallest of details, it is very reassuring.  I highly recommend anyone bring their car to this location.< /review>

Took my Audi A4 to fix all dents including roof dents before returning my Audi at end of lease. They said they fixed all dents and scratches, so I wouldn’t get charged by Audi for returning my car with scratches and dents. Returned my car to Audi dealership on 4/26 . Audi financial called me and said there was still damage to my roof and other dents,and I had to pay Audi $1500 for dents and scratches they found. Calliber collisions charged me 2k to fix the roof and other dents, but obviously they didn’t. I wasted 2k at Calliber collision.i still would have been charged $1500 even if I didn’t take it to caliber collision< /Review>

Absolutely the best body shop I have been to! (I've had my share of accidents) The customer service was awesome. From the moment I called for directions to my scheduled drop off day. It was just smooth. Really felt like they cared and wanted to take the stress off of me. They even arranged a rental for me. What was really nice is that the rental did take a little longer than expected (maybe 15 minutes, no biggy) but they offered to take me to the rental office themselves in their shuttle van. I was actually ok just waiting in their customer lobby drinking their fancy coffee, chatting away with Raul, Jillian and Joey! Great crew, you can just tell everyone is happy and enjoys what they do. I was intimidated at first to be honest, when I pulled up all I saw were really nice vehicles, Porsche's, Rovers, Audi's... I was like, they won't work on my little Ford... But nope, they took good care of her and kept me updated throughout the repair! Needless to say...They have a customer for life, because I know I will be back for something! LOL! Oh and my car came out pretty good and they offer a lifetime warranty! Awesome!<//Review>

I am so happy that Gamer’s Path has reopened in Manteca. The new owners are friendly and knowledgeable. Great collection of dice! We are really looking forward to some of the events they are talking about hosting in the near future.< /Review>

Place was run by a guy who has questionable integrity. We bought the rest of his Magic Inventory and he purposely left out all of his good cards and lied about the value of his stock. Luke seemed like a nice guy but when it came to honest business dealings, he is obviously a shifty person. Makes sense why the place closed down.</Review>

Also, there's no gate-keeping here. Whether you're new to a game or a seasoned veteran, you can count on the folks here to be helpful and inviting. That goes for the staff and the customers.</text>< pics>

It's a great place if your looking for Magic the Gathering cards and accessories. The owner is really nice and very helpful with everything you need to help make decks. Not to mention all the board games and D&D merchandise that are sold pretty good prices. I highly recommend trying it out!<//review>

Its a nice little store, plenty of  board games and other gaming stuff. Kind of a weak Warhammer selection.. although they do have the full line of Citadel paints and even one or two you cant find anymore (at least last time I was there) I only paint so this store isn't as tailored to me as others, but in any case, if you're a gamer its a great place.< /Review>

Really great space to play any game. We used the private room for our RPG and the price was super reasonable. All the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. We also used the free tables for board games. We will be visiting again!</text>

Decent selection of materials, gaming tables, and a private room. Love the maps on the walls. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable, prices are reasonable. Overall a good place to shop and hang out with other gamers.</Text>

<Review>It's a wonderful place to play Magic: The Gathering. The owner runs all events, and creates a very welcoming environment. It's not as competitive of an environment as other stores, but the payout is always impressive across the board.<//Review>< pics>

<text>I'm so happy to have a friendly local game shop. Good selection of the card and board games, and RPGs which is what interests me, along with the miniatures etc. They host tournaments and weekly RPG games too. I always enjoy dropping in.</text>< Pictures>

Yep......You can never go wrong at Gamer's Path. We have returned time and time again. We had to order a few rare items, but it saved trying to chase it down.</review>

<Review>Walked in for the first time and immediately felt like I was welcomed. I spoke to the (I assume owner) and he was incredibly helpful and talked with me for about 30 minutes to answer all of my random noob questions. I am always worried about going into a gaming or comics store for the first time because all too often the clerks are condescending and a lot like the comic store owner in the Simpsons. Not here and I'm very grateful for that.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>I have been going to car doctor for about 20 years, now.  Way back then, I realized, their foremost concern is safety.  If your ride isn't safe, neither are you!  This last time, my O2 sensor was causing the check engine light to go on.  I was a gearhead growing up, and they are aware of this.  When I called, Chris first advised me on some service I myself could do, with the hope we could address this in a more cost efficient manner.  When that didn't work, I took my van in and with more diagnostic work, they were able to take care of my issue quickly and pretty economically.
My job takes me all over CA and beyond.  I need my van to be reliable so that I can go on the road in a moments notice.  Car Doctor gives me the peace of mind to get on the road and return safely.  In the end, isn't that what we all want?< /review>< Name>

After all, you drive your car nearly every day. And, of course, it is a huge investment. The fear of "crooked mechanics" is often based upon personal experience and personal pain.

However, the good reviews of The Car Doctor are very accurate. The people working on your vehicle will treat it with the same care and love as they would their own.

I wholeheartedly recommend The Car Doctor! After two separate experiences at their location, I'm convinced that they are honest and accurate. I'm not alone: I listened to others while I was waiting to drop off or pick up my vehicles. They treated my two Ford SUVs with the same care for which they treated some premium and luxury vehicles that they were working on.

Like many people, I've had some bad experiences with mechanics. I've experienced what happens when you take your car to a dealership and  the mechanics suddenly find different things that are "wrong" -- expensive things that still don't fix the car.

The guys at The Car Doctor are not like that. They quickly determined what was wrong. They quickly fixed it and for less than what the dealerships charge.

It almost sounds disingenuous for someone to say that they "trust" a mechanic. However, I actually trust the guys at The Car Doctor. If you're looking for a mechanic that you can entrust your vehicle with, then I wholeheartedly suggest these guys!

LOCATION: They are located in Palo Alto on San Antonio Road near the intersection with Middlefield.<//text><user_name>Chris M<//user_name><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxnyU0mQ3ZsNJ7QxuIgnG07oO1eJbbdL6_Tn5f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_0BVm700Fk0_e3aOFDfcdkKTjgCEgISGYHRWX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAmdwe8QGPrRag54ZV4VJ_4f0gjQ7CPhbAhuuW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures></record>

I got a car after starting to work in the Bay Area.  I remember the first 3-4 years when I wandered around different dealerships and auto-repair shops recommended by my friends.  They may/may not have done a good job, may/may not be good value, but I am not sure if any of them really had my best interest at heart.

It is different with the Car Doctor.  They take care of your car, and they also take care of your wallet.  They've told me that some of the rickety-ness on my 8 y/o Corolla is not safety threatening so don't worry ; they've told me to delay changing brakes/tires because it is still safe to go for another 5000-7000 miles based on my usage pattern; then when the time came, they actually told me that Costco happens to have a great Michelin tire deal at that time and I should go there.

So when they say something "is" required, I listen.  For instance they probably recommend oil change slightly more frequently than what's advised for synthetic oil.  But that is because they want my CRV to go 500k miles. (apparently that is very doable) (and for any lingering doubters, there's barely any profit margin for oil change)

It has been about 7 years since my first visit.  I've moved from Mountain View, to Santa Clara, and now to East San Jose, but I continue to make the trek (ok, drive) to the Car Doctors every 6-9 months, for both my car and my wife's car, to have them maintain it.

As I gain my years in adult life, I found out that finding someone who has both good skills AND a good heart is an exceeding rarity.  I would wholeheartedly say that the Car Doctor is one of these rare finds, and they deserve every star on their Yelp (and now Google) review.</text>

They truly want to help those like me that don't want to know about the mechanics of a car. Also not condescending to me.

They commend a bit more premium but it's more than worth it for the quality of work. I also appreciate the fact that they advise you on what should be fixed and the right time to fix it. Some cases they advise not to based on the age and the value of the car.< /Review><userid>113504167155529300887< /userid>< Pics>

<review>In need of a car check-up? The Car Doctor will treat your car right!

We recently started bringing both our cars (2003 Chevy Malibu with 215k miles and a 2010 BMW 135i with 81k miles) and we're impressed off the bat with their friendly and open employees. Coming from Larry's (miss them so badly), we felt right at home. They know which things are dire fixes and which things can wait in case your wallet is strapped.

Definitely talk to Dave if you can! He's super chill and really nice with tons of great car knowledge.< /review>< pictures>

<text>Gary and Chris at the Car Doctor are top notch and some of the absolute nicest people! I took my car there in need of an oil change but knowing it needed a good look over. (It's an old car that I'm trying to just keep alive.) They were prompt with getting back to me (a HUGE pet peeve of past mechanics, never calling when they say they will), and really thoughtful about they way they provided information about the work that needed to be done today and things that I could put off a little, to help with my budget. This is huge in that I never want to spend an arm and leg if my car is just going to die, but they were able to help me make an informed smart decision for where I am.

I feel that they are absolutely trust-worthy, one of the most affordable mechanics I've been to in a LONG time, and really all around good guys who care about their customers. I'm thankful I found them and looking forward to taking our other family car to them now too. Thanks Chris and Gary!<//text>< pics>

I find the Car Doctor to be a super ethical business. They are always prompt and thorough in the work they perform.  If they think I can get the work done better and/or cheaper somewhere else (ie the car dealer),  they will direct me there. I do not know very many businesses that will give you this kind of advice. I recommend Dave Hanson as a service writer. I followed him from a previous garage that went out of business. Highly recommended all around!</Text>

<text>These two brothers seemingly offered to be helpful when we took our car to them, but then scammed us shamelessly. Our red BMW was fine, it just had a small transmission problem, until they damaged it beyond repair, then offered to buy it. They said they’d encountered new problems with the car, many more things were wrong. We drove it in, could not drive it out. They then said only they would be able to put it to any use, that we should sell it to them for 500 USD. We lost money on that car but there’s no way we’d let them keep it. Hope this helps prevent harm to someone in the future.</text>< pics>

Knowledgeable and reliable care for your car. I took my old and dying car there they put DOA on the receipt didn't charge me and said it's time to get a new car. I took my new car in they did the oil change checked everything out and said there is nothing wrong with this car. It is so wonderful to have honest mechanics< /Text>

I have taken my car here twice and been really satisfied. They are very kind and welcoming, always remember your name and car. They let me know I had an issue that didn't need fixing right away, but would eventually need to be replaced. I was able to save up and come back on my own terms. I would highly recommend this business!!</review>

<text>This place and the owners are AMAZING. There's a reason why you see nothing but nearly all 5 star ratings. They're more than fair - they actually care. When a dealership gave me an egregious quote to fix a car with less than 30,000 miles on it Gary and Chris were amazing to me and made sure I really knew what was going on and gave me honest quotes and advice. I will NEVER take a car somewhere else as long as I'm anywhere near the entire Bay Area and beyond.

Do not recommend.  I have had only one experience here, and seeing the other reviews, maybe my experience was unique.  Went in with a detached sensor on my brake pads.  Without really explaining what they were doing, they replaced all my brakes and  my rotors....waaayyy too much money later, this was completely necessary and not well communicated.  Upon picking my car up, the mechanic proceeded to tell me I should replace the entire shock system on my car to prevent the cupping of the tires and I should do it very soon.  He was trying to sell me some advanced, very expensive system.  Well I went to another mechanic and he simply said I just need to rotate the tires more frequently to prevent the cupping and he fixed it up in tiny fraction of the cost of what this place was trying to sell me.  I felt completely taken advantage of at this place.  Will not be going back.</text>

They had two of the top ten mechanics out of 10,000 who signed up for testing. People drove a thousand miles to get their annual checkup at that shop. Never had a day of trouble with that car. Nothing but maintenance. Was I sorry when I graduated and moved.

Now, I've found Chris and Gary and I have peace of mind again. They will walk you out to the car and show you the problem. They are friendly, report what is happening, and  explain future work and estimated costs. They send reminders to keep you on track, give tips on top vs. second priority car care, offer alternatives, discuss advantages of manufacturer's recommendations vs. other options, stay on top of the latest products. They will send you to lower cost, high quality competitors for services they don't offer.

I got a 6-9 month heads up when I needed a $1400 leak on the timing belt.  Set up a savings plan for the bill. It was painless.

I've got my fingers crossed; the car is moving into it's twelfth year but so far, nothing but maintenance. (Oil leaks are routine for old Subarus)

Tip: if you are thinking about buying a car, contact Gary and Chris. They know cars and engines right down to the year.

It's the most transparent comprehensive service I've ever received. You know your options and consequences.

I don't know what I'll do if I move.  Unless it's back to Ithaca.

Hail Chris and Gary. Live long and prosper.</text>< Time>

Gary and Chris are always upfront and never push unnecessary repairs - they're super meticulous, great at what they do and are looking to save you money and fix your car in the best possible way all the time.
I've had oil changes done at their shop for the last few years as well as other major work (timing belt, brakes, shocks) on my high mileage '01 XTerra and my experience has always been amazing.< /review>< response>

Hands down the best shop I've ever had my car serviced. Not only are they proficient mechanics, but also incredibly customer-focused.

The prices are reasonable, the workmanship is excellent, and they're always accommodating. In my first trip there, here was my experience:

After assessing my 90k '97 Sentra, Chris addressed a number of issues that were necessary to make it California drivable after a trip from Ohio (exhaust, smog, etc.) He gave me his quote and one from his exhaust specialist (a different business). The specialist's was lower, so he did the repairs through that shop.

He discovered a number of other issues, including failing continuous velocity joints, which would have cost more to repair than the car was worth. Chris's recommendation: "Drive it into the ground and sell it for scrap. Put the scrap money towards a new car."

I've had a decent bit of work here and refer all my friends. I've been going to them for over a year, and won't go anywhere else.< /Review>

<Review>I've been taking my 2007 Prius to The Car Doctor for over 70,000 miles and my car is still running great.  The last few auto shops (including the Toyota Dealership) did a terrible job on my car before I started using The Car Doctor, as if they didn't really have much experience working with hybrids.  I've had them do my brakes and struts replacements, very quick and very reasonably priced.  Chris and Gary stand behind their work and even if I could find a place that was cheaper, I wouldn't be able to match the quality of the work by a long shot.  They get the job done fast and right the first time.  As a pretty cool bonus, they keep an electronic record of all your service work online so you can check your service record anytime you want.  Another nice bonus is that they have an Enterprise car rental just around the corner (walking distance) in case you ever need to leave your car at the shop.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

My roommate recommended The Car Doctor to me when I moved up to the area, and I couldn't be happier. They've been saving me a bundle (especially on the expensive repairs), and they're always straight with me about what is critical and what I can ignore. Unlike the guys at my car's dealership, Gary and Chris actually care about *the truth* about what my needs actually are, and they aren't just out to make a quick buck--and that is no doubt why their business is successful. I will definitely be using them again in the future!< /Text>

Great guys and did an awesome (and fast) job on my 1999 Toyota Landcruiser. Even talked me out of som more expensive repairs that they thought they could have done but wasn't really justified given the age of the car. Highly recommend.< /text>

<review>Summary: Friendly service, great price, and took in my truck on a busy schedule.

Great experience with Gary.

My Ford F150 started stalling during idle. Couldn't even go a mile reliably. I called The Car Doctor and asked for an appointment ASAP, but was told they were booked for at least two weeks. They asked me to explain my problem, and then put Gary on the phone. Gary took time to try to fix my problem over the phone (for free), and when he couldn't he gave me a great deal and offered to at least diagnose the problem that very same day and said the fee could be spent toward servicing it whenever my appointment could come up.

I brought it in the next day and told Gary exactly what happened, and it turns out I didn't really tell him all the truck's problems. It didn't seem like a quick fix anymore, but he still looked at it right away anyway. Later he gives me a call and  goes over everything that he's done and plans to do. I appreciated his effort to make sure there was no grey area of what he was doing to my truck. Gary had my truck fixed the following morning. I even made the mistake of not giving him my alarm fob so my truck was stuck in his repair bay for several hours. Even still, the job ended up costing less than expected.

Gary seemed very close and friendly with all the customers that he interacted with. As he walked me to my truck a car pulled up and waited there next to us as Gary and I chatted for at least 10 minutes. As I left, the guy in the car asked Gary for advice on an oil change. Gary gave it to him and the guy said "thanks" and drove off. Most likely the guy was working for Gary, because I was way too impressed by his friendliness. =)<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Text>...which is the only reason they still get a 4.

I called ahead and made an oil change appointment, told them what model my car was - it requires a more expensive, different-than-normal filter - and when I got there they didn't have the filter, several days later.  I was on my lunchbreak, had to wait extra time while they ordered the part from Sunnyvale, but was discounted for my wasted time as well as apologized to for the inconvenience.

They've never messed up on anything for me before, and I've heard enough Jiffy Lube horror stories that I'll keep going here rather than some huge chain, but... stay on top of it please, guys.< /Text><gmap_id>0x808fba0c4d1ddc57:0x44b11ca34840e3f3</gmap_id>< user_name>

After 20+ years of CPR training this is hands down the best I have ever experienced. The EMT that led the class was very knowledgeable and made the class fun. As an RN I actually learned a few new things. I love the laid back environment and would definitely use them in the future.</Review>

BEST CPR class I’ve ever had. The instructor Miguel is super helpful, professional and efficient. They provide useful tips and help with memorization. Coming out of the class feeling I’m equipped with knowledge and confidence to actually save someone in need. I would recommend this class to everyone I know.< /text>

I took the class for work but Miguel did a great job of explaining how this class is relevant for everyone regardless of needing it for work. He did an amazing job not only teaching CPR but what is happening in the body and how CPR works. He was very professional and knowledgeable. I have taken numerous CPR training courses and this one was hands down the best I have ever attended. Highly recommend!< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Wonderful instructor, very motivating and informative. I found it great to learn because it was very hands on following all the protective guidelines to participants in order to prevent the spread of disease as well. All questions were answered clearly and there were realistic scenarios to learn from in the videos! It was easy working with the class instructor, while using up to date equipment with gloves and face masks and sanitizers. I would recommend for healthcare providers & professionally licensed businesses, in addition to personal training for day to day activities. It is important to know what to do in the case of emergency situations that might rise to the level of first aide, assistance with choking, & Cardiopulmonary resuscitation being needed.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

These guys are professional and do a great job teaching the material. They also did a great job despite Covid19. Everything was sterilized multiple times during the class and they had good work arounds for things that couldn't be sterilized properly. Lots of space between attendees too. And you get your card right there at the end of the class! Thanks 😊<//review>

<Review>I can't recommend Professional CPR enough. I learned so much from the CPR class taught by Rick. He is extremely experienced, took the time to ask and answer tons of questions, gave real life examples and really wanted to make sure we would feel confident in an emergency situation. I am sending my husband and babysitter here and also recommending to all the parents I know and anyone who needs to take CPR for work. Thank you guys for this great service!! Also I wanted to add I felt super safe as far as COVID goes and they are taking all the necessary precautions, so don't wait!<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>This was my first time taking a BLS class through Professional CPR and definitely won’t be the last! My instructor was Kassidy, she was very thorough and explained each step in detail. The class was very informative and I feel like I retained what I learned quickly which is great. Thank you!!</text>< pics>

The class was very informative and straight to the point to where it did not take up too much time.  We finished in 3.5 hours, and the instructor was good about taking into account that almost everyone had taken the same CPR class before, so it was more of a review than a full-on introductory course. I would attend again</Text>

I took my BSL / CPR /AED class yesterday .
I was very impressed with our instructor
Jeremy . He displayed excellent and accurate
and current knowledge as a course instructor, with hands on professional experience. He was
positive and up beat in leading the class.He gave us individual attention as needed and answered all our questions.
This is the first time I went to Professional CPR Sacramento.  I have used another group for 15 yrs., to recieve and keep all my RN required certifications and renewals.  I commuted 45minutes to take this course.  It was well worth it. I  highly recommend Pro CPR Sacramento.<//text>

<Time>1591030459924<//Time><text>Instructor and training course was very thorough. This is the most informative CPR/AED/Basic First Aid course I have taken. I am a fly fishing guide and I took the class in order to obtain my USGC Captain's license and this met the federal requirements for those obtaining a USGC license. Highly recommend Professional CPR to anyone from a parent to a professional in the outdoor industry. You don't have to be a professional to potentially save a life, you just need the proper training and education. At Professional CPR, you'll find just that!< /text>< Resp>

Very well run class. Like others have mentioned, it is not only about learning how to do to CPR but what is happening in the person’s body when you do and the importance of it. Would recommend to anyone!< /Text>

Amazing experience needed this class for my job. Went to American Red Cross and did not have a good experience. I immediately looked online and this business was the first link. I called and immediately was scheduled for a class that evening. The instructor was friendly, knowledgeable and patient which allowed my experience to be fun. Will definitely return when I need to recertify.<//Text>

Miguel was our instructor and he did an amazing job! He made the class interesting, answered all of our questions, and gave feedback when we were practicing our skills. He also did a wonderful job explaining the "why" behind everything we were doing and-though I've taken CPR courses before-this was the first time it hit me how truly important knowing CPR is. Thanks for the great class!< /Text>

The staff was wonderful. They had a lot of knowledge about what they were teaching. They explained things in detail and had a ton of useful information not only do I need but everyone out there should know. I've been to CPR classes before but this class by far has given me more insight on what to do in case of emergency. Thank you so much for coming and teaching us what you have. You guys rock!!!<//Review>

My experience with this class was not only extremely educational but also very real and practical. I’ve done classes before and this one by far was the best. No beating around the bush and personal interactions with the whole class. Our instructor gave value to why CPR was important and gave us all the information and practical application skills to carry out into the real world.<//Review>

I have been taking CPR classes every two years since 2002.  I can honestly say this was the best class I have taken.  Well done.  Presentation was well done, instructor was clear, knowledgeable and not boring.< /Review>

This class was great, better than some other classes I have taken prior to this one. The instructor was very good and covered everything and told stories along the way. At the end of the class I left feeling confident in what I had just learned and ready to apply it to any situation if need be.</review>

<Text>It is a great feeling knowing that I now have the knowledge to help someone in need. This was a quick, but very thorough class. Denae was a knowledgeable instructor who explained things clearly and in a way that everyone could understand. I am very glad that I chose Professional CPR to learn CPR and basic first aid for my teaching credential!< /Text><Response>None</Response><Rating>5</Rating>< user_name>

Lots of time for questions, good practice session and I’m confident in the skills I learned there. I highly recommend Professional CPR for First Aid/CPR Training.<//review>

The CPR/ BLS instructor actually came to our work place and I have to say this has being the most beneficial and pleasant experience so far. I was well informed and the course was enjoyable over all. Learned valuable lessons that will stay with me for a long time. TY Jeremy Shuman. You are the best.<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Miguel taught a fantastic course. Right up front we were provided with an outline of what to expect for the day & length of time we were likely going to be there. His delivery of content was easy to understand, easy to follow, & the demonstrations were easy to remember. The fact that this company focuses on giving you the important information you need to remember, and not all the other stuff, is a great approach. There was no test but everyone had to perform their learnings to prove the information was retained. Highly recommended, very easy to stay focused and engaged the entire time and I believe I learned more in this class, with their approach, than previous CPR classes (which had tests). Well done, guys!!!< /Text>< pictures>

I initially took a CPR course with another company about a month ago, but after finding out it wasn’t enough training for my field requirements, I took this class because I needed my certificate to reflect BLS training. I honestly learned so much more about helping someone in need than I ever have before ( and I’ve maintained CPR training for over twelve years).. EXCELLENT COURSE, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<//review>

<text>I recently took a Professional CPR class at my local CalFit and absolutely loved it!
The instructor was awesome and knew what he was talking about.

I loved the layout of the class because it got straight to the main points; what CPR is, and why do we do it.
I love how it was simply broken down without all the extra information, that other classes have, that can lead to much confusion.

I’m speaking from first hand experience because being in the medical field you are constantly updating your CPR training to better help your patients.

I will definitely be taking this course again when I need to update in 2 years.<//text>< resp>

Great CPR/AED + First Aid class. Distilled down to the key points and explaining why CPR is needed. Great balance of lecture and hands on practice. Miguel was a great instructor: clear, comprehensive, encouraged questions and answered then thoroughly. I will certainly return every two years for my foster parent requirements and recommend Professional CPR to others.< /review>

My second recertification with Pro CPR. I think it really makes a difference having first responders running these classes. They regularly deliver CPR in emergency situations and their real-world experience (happy ending or otherwise) gets handed down to the students. I have found these classes to be MUCH more informative than the ones I took with Red Cross. That said, we could have used one more "hands-on" skill run-through and done with one less story of the instructor's on-the-job experiences. Try to schedule your class with an instructor who is an EMT or Para-Medic.</Review>

<Text>Instructor Dennis was fun and kept the class engaged. He provided all the materials you need including snacks and coffee. You also do not need your book so don’t make the mistake of buying one, since he will not let you return it even if it is still sealed and/or if you have one. Otherwise, wasn’t too bad of a class.<//Text>< GmapID>

This was a perfect refresher course. It fit my schedule, didn’t take up my whole day and was still very informative. The instructor did a great job of covering the information, supervising the hands-on portion and making sure we were performing correctly, and fielding our questions without dragging it out. Thank you for providing a quality training program<//Review>

<time>1551223642177< /time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Quick and to the point! I took a class specifically for healthcare professionals so there wasn't a lot of need to cover the basics of how the body works and how CPR acts on it. We went over a bunch of scenarios and situations, providing modifications for assessment, diverse bodies, and settings other than the hospital. The instructor was kind and focused and even the equipment we were working with was really helpful for giving feedback on speed and depth of compressions.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I would absolutely recommend going here for any class. Sarah was my instructor and she really sweet and informative. She made the class fun and answered any questions the class may have had. They also have snacks and drinks which I thought was really nice especially for those late classes. Overall really great experience and would definitely come back.</Text>

Great class! The instructor was very helpful in answering questions and giving clear and understanding answers. He made the class much more enjoyable and made everyone feel comfortable. Lots of laughs going around which helped the atmosphere to be friendly and not so boring so no one was dreading being in the class. I will definitely be going back here when it is time to renew!</Review>

There was the perfect amount of hands on training and the PowerPoint and videos were direct and of good quality. The instructor was knowledgeable and made the learning environment enjoyable.

First of all, I recently got offered a job and needed to get my certification ASAP.  As luck would have it, I was able to attend the following day.  The instructor, Miguel, was not only knowledgeable, but he made the class interesting.  Everything he taught, simple yet effective.  But most importantly, retainable.  I highly recommend taking a class through this company.  Their equipment as well as the instructions are fresh and pleasant to do.< /review>

First time taking a CPR renewal with Professional CPR in Stockton. Steve was an amazing instructor. He was very knowledgable and kept the class well engaged. He shared many of his experiences during his career and gave us different types of scenarios we may one day encounter. Thank you for a great cpr class.<//Review>

Overall, great experience. Kevin was very straight forward as he went through the details. He went over each point to ensure each student fully understood the material. Kevin made sure everyone was on the same page before moving on and kept it enticing enough for you to want more. It was pretty quick and I feel quite confident in potentially saving someone’s life. Looking forward to renewing my certification with Professional CPR when the time comes, maybe then I’ll take the First Aid class as well.
Great job Kevin, I won’t say ‘adequate.’<//text>

<Text>My instructor was beyond excellent, he gave me real life application to the skills taught in class. Not only did I leave class feeling completely confident I could give high quality cpr, I understood why cpr works and how to adapt to different body types and situations. I’ve been to countless cpr classes and this Instructor has simply blown them out of the water.</Text><Response>None<//Response>< Pics>

Our instructor Miguel was very clear, professional and entertaining all at the same time. I genuinely feel like I have what it takes to do CPR in an emergency situation after taking this class, especially with the hands-on training.< /Text>

Very nice facility.  Right when you walk in you are greeted and ushered to the break room where they serve coffee, tea and assorted snacks.  Then the instructor starts with a fun video of what not to do that had us a laughing.  It was a nice change from the usual doom and gloom.  He explained everything so fluidly and answered any questions we all had in ways it made us all able to put the techniques in to perspective.  I will be coming back here for recertification in two years for sure< /Review>

I really enjoyed the CPR/AED/First Aid class this time.  Miguel was a dynamic instructor that made the class interesting and fun.  The hands-on practice was very valuable.  The instructions were clear and concise, and very easy to follow.  I definitely recommend Professional CPR!<//Review>

Jake is a very informative teacher. He kept the class on track & at a steady pace. I've taken this class with other sites & its either to fast or too slow.  The information delivered was very easy to understand.  I'll be renewing with Professional CPR when my two years are up.  Great job!!<//Review>

I really appreciate that classes are offered after 530pm. If gives time to those who work late to even get over and get a class.
Thank you<//review>< rate>

<Text>I had a great time taking my BLS training with Professional CPR @ this location! Jessica & Rick we’re both welcoming, and made the experience fun and straight to the point! Jessica had great experience doing CPR and was very knowledgeable. She made sure we were confident with our skills by the time we finished the class.
They even provided snacks and water in their break room!

Would deff recommend!!</Text>< pictures>

All of the instructors were very professional and made a 6 hour class feel fun! The staff Billy, Joe, Jeremy & Malin were very approachable and willing to answer any questions as many times as the class needed. They encouraged interaction with each and every one of them, and also made sure that they catered to everyone's learning style.  Overall would recommend to anyone who has never taken a CPR class , or who just needs to refresh. (:<//review>

Miguel was awesome, very informative and knowledgeable and made learning something that most feel can be complicated, quite simple! The hands on aspect of the class was probably my favorite since I tend to learn and retain better when I am able to learn hands on!!! And I left the CPR/First Aid class WITH my certification! No waiting for weeks for it to come in the mail!!! Woohoo!!! Bravo Professional CPR and Miguel, fantastic job today!! (May 19, 2018)</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

I loved the CPR class in Modesto! It was very informative and I learned a lot! Matt was an awesome instructor to have and he knew how to make the class fun at the same time as we were learning. I will definitely come back to renew my CPR once it expires again... thank you for being so kind with me and teaching me so much in such a short amount of time!</review>

<Review>This class was amazing! Professional yet had a relaxed vibe which made learning easy and actully fun. Ryan is an awesome teacher. He is great at explaining, showing, answering questions and was really easy to hear and understand. So happy to be certified and confident that I can help save lives 💜 5 stars all the way. The class didn't take up much of my time and didn't break the bank. (Time and money are important to me) 😜</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

I took the 3 hour class for CPR, AED, & First Aid certification with Rick. I needed the class because I am a care giver for a 7 year old with cerebral palsy. The class was very informative and easy to follow. I now feel confident that I will be able to administer care in an emergency situation. Rick was also very helpful. He answered all of my questions that related specifically to my situation with a young girl who is wheelchair bound and has limited muscle movement. It didn’t feel like 3 hours at all because of how important and useful the information was. I highly recommend this class to everyone, especially those who provide care for the physically disable of all ages.</review>

Best BLS class I've had! Highly highly HIGHLY recommend to everyone!!! Stephen Kihlthau was an awesome instructor with a great sense of humor, fun teaching style (He started off witha clip from the show, The , very helpful, knowledgeable and professional. Snacks, water, coffee and tea was provided, hands-on skills training, PowerPoint, class participation and class interaction was a plus! I was pretty skeptical taking a BLS class elsewhere besides Red Cross, but I was very pleased with the experience! Will come back for renewal in the future!< /Review>

When you leave you feel like hey I think I will really remember  this and want to use what we learned. I spoke to a few people in the class yesterday and they felt the exact same way, as being an EMT she instilled in us that we DO make a difference an just how important it is to do what you know because a person only has 6 minutes an when your doing your part it stops the clock. Very interesting an important stuff we learned from her. I have been to 4 CPR classes in my life time and this one with Sarah was by far the the very BEST!!!!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

They were able to answer all of our questions and made learning process entertaining. We in education call that edutainment. Thanks guys, great job.</review></record></dataset><record>

This was by far the best CPR class I have ever taken! Short and to the point. The instructors were fun and extremely informational. I will definitely be back for my next certification. Thank you! :)<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>I attended one of the Adult and Child CPR/AED and First Aid classes with ProCPR and it was the perfect, small classroom setting that I was looking for! Denae was my instructor and made sure to keep the 4 hour class as short, but informative as possible. There were only 8 students in my class, which went from about 6:30 to 10:30, but the amount of students made it really comfortable to ask questions and not be afraid to practice on the dummy. Overall, the class was incredibly thorough when it came to CPR and AED, but the First Aid portion was a little rushed through. Seeing as you can watch basic first aid videos online, I didn’t mind sticking to the most important parts of First Aid. The classroom was incredibly clean, nice, and there was a selection of snacks and coffee. I would definitely recommend ProCPR to anyone who needs to take a CPR or First Aid class and wants a comfortable, small class with very hands on instructors.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I dragged my feet to this training.  Once there, I was incredibly impressed with the usefulness of the information, and thoroughly embraced the idea that being equipped to help could be essential to saving a life (or helping someone in need).  Thanks, guys.  Excellent work.<//Text>

I am so thankful to have taken pediatric cpr and first aide at this location. Rick was very kind and he made this experience fun and extremely informational. Hopefully i will never need to do cpr or first aide however after taking the class, I feel so much more comfortable about using techniques that i learned in his class.I would absolutely recommend taking cpr and first aide with Rick. Thank you, Rick!</Review>

I will remember what I need to do in choking or respiratory arrest.  I think the training can be improved by a bit more team work on the part of the presenters. Though they did set up the dummies  and AED machines while the presentation was going on.  Worth the time spent.</review>< Pics>

This was my fourth CPR class that I have taken in the past fifteen years. I usually leave class feeling overwhelmed and with dread that I'll ever have to perform CPR. But this class was different, the instructor was personable, relatable, funny, and patient. He explained real life scenarios and explained what we can do to help in a very realistic way. I received hands on experience and I can honestly say I would feel comfortable implementing the skills I learned in a real life situation. Thanks so much for the knowledge and confidence to maybe save a life one day!<//Text>

The instructors explained the importance of us being the first responders to assist in possibly saving lives or helping others that are injured and getting past the fears of just being a bystander.  They made us feel comfortable with the whole CPR/AED/First Aid process.  Overall, I enjoyed learning about the AED and re-learning the CPR process with the updates!!</text>< userid>

This class is literally a life saver!!! I am glad I took this class. Chris was a great teacher and kept the class light and fun. He did a great job teaches us the "why" to CPR. I hope more people take this class and use what they learned when it is needed.</Review>

I liked the class but what I didn’t like was how on the site it makes you think if it’s your first time that you have to buy the manual. In the class that I took we didn’t even open ours so it’s a rip off. 20$ for a book i didn’t even open? No thanks.<//Text>

My instructor was Jake and he had great knowledge of the topic at hand and was really engaging and fun. This was my first enjoyable class that I have been to throughout my career. It was the cheapest class I could find on the internet, but the best as far as material they presented.The professionalism started immediately when I called regarding the book and Erin willingly and efficiently answered all of the questions I had. I would highly recommend taking Professional CPR because you will not regret it. I will be taking classes with these guys until I retire.

This was absolutely worst training I have ever gone through. There was no hands on training at all. Just the same information repeated over and over again. If you want real training then I highly suggest that you go through the Red Cross.</Text>

This is the 6th or 7th time I've taken BLS for healthcare providers, and this class was by far the best I've had. The instructor Denae, assessed the experience level of the students. She kept the class interesting for those of us who've taken it multiple times, but simple and concise for the first timers. The  equipment and CPR dummies were all high quality, the facility clean and pleasant and there were even refreshments provided. I would highly recommend Professional CPR.< /Review>

<text>Just finished completing this course for work and we had a great time learning about the CPR and First Aid. Our instructor Jonas was very knowledgeable in the matter and made the class enjoyable and comfortable enough to use these skills effectively if the situation was to arise. I highly recommend the course to everyone, you never know when it’ll come in handy.<//text>< Pictures>

I took a course and it was really informative and fun. The instructor was pretty funny and he made sure that everyone understood.  We did CPR and used the AED on mannequins we was good kind of a hands on experience. I had tooken a course a couple years back and it was nothing like this. Would highly recommend this class.</Text>

The class is well organised, clearly presented and does not overload your brain with too many details. Instead, we were able to practise the methods and really memorise them! Our instructor, Miguel, was awesome -- great sense of humour, easy to understand and very knowledgeable. This might be the first time I actually enjoyed my CPR/First Aid class. :-D<//text>< pics>

Highly recommended to become educated on CPR, the Heimlich Maneuver and basic first aid that could make the difference of saving a life. Rick was a friendly and knowledgeable teacher that encouraged participants to get outside of their comfort zone while in the classroom to be most prepared to take control should an emergency situation call for a Good Samaritan.< /review>

I enjoyed the hands-on experience of learning the proper way to do CPR. The instructors made sure we were given many opportunities to show what we have learned by giving us time to reflect and respond. I’ve learned a lot and I really found the training helpful.<//Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>This was easily the best CPR class I've ever done.

I've done numerous CPR classes and this surpassed them all by far.

Jack DeWees and Ryan Romero were excellent!

It was a great mix of humor and information. I've been CPR certified for over a decade and I learned quite a few useful things from Jack that I've never heard.

It was very fast paced, which I enjoyed. But it was still easy to follow and retain.

Nice work guys.<//text>< user_id>

The CPR class gave me the chance to learn about why and when CPR needs to be used.  Experience is the best teacher, and I was able to first-hand perform CPR. Now if I ever find myself in a dangerous situation, I will be able to perform CPR safely and effectively.< /Text>

<Text>Excellent class!
I have taken BLS and CPR courses my whole life and this place was by far the best experience I've had. It was reasonably priced and very convenient. I signed up online and the classroom was clean and professional. Our instructor, Tyson was a firefighter and he explained everything thoroughly and answered everyones questions. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking. Thanks!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>I enjoyed presentation yesterday in stockton @ Bank America Annex. I think time frame was too long. They should do a refresher course not to long. Maybe for people that are new to district or haven’t done cpr in years should do the class for six hours. Loved hands on. To many breaks.  A lil unorganized. A gentleman that attended  the class kept interrupting. I get he was a firefighter and gave some valuable information but the presenters were there to present not him. Sorry<//text>< pictures>

Loved this place! Our instructor Jack made the while class laugh but at the same time made the information learnable and relatable.  Place was a little hard to find at first but once I found it they made me welcome and comfortable. The classrom was organized and clean and they also had coffee.  Clean bathrooms too!  If your looking for a good place to take a CPR class then I highly recommend Professional CPR in Gold River!<//review>

<Date>1513277626401<//Date><Text>This place offers the best CPR courses in the Sac region. I took my recertification for the BLS for Healthcare Providers course here on 12/14/17. The instructor, Jake, was really engaging and presented the guidelines for CPR very clearly. The set-up of the course is in a powerpoint and demo method. I left the place feeling like I learned a lot of good information that I can apply to the real setting.

My instructor was Jake. His teachings were straight forward and cut to the chase! He was very professional and knew what he was talking about. When it was time to practice on the mannequins, adult and infant, again Jake was very clear with instructions. I highly recommend ANYONE who is looking to be Certified to take classes here!
