Delicious coffee! The Aloha White Mocha is great! The banana syrup isn't noticeable at all and adds a ridiculous flavor. Highly recommended.<//text>

The coffee here is great, the prices are even better.
My only complaint is within the first sentence of me talking to the "Barista" she informs me she has COVID.

Ok, thanks for letting me know!</Text>

This barista may had told you she HAD covid (past tense), but she did not have it at the time.

My favorite coffee shack. Love this place! Good quality coffee and friendly staff. I wish it stayed open a little later but it definitely dies down after 12pm. Great coconut and vanilla lattes, you can taste the shaka coffee beans. The acai bowls are awesome too,  I'm obsessed with this place.  They also have a punch card it's great!!<//text>

The coffee drinks and acai bowls are great, but deducted one star for their requirement that you wear a mask when going through the drive thru.
Out in the open air, sitting in your car, about 6ft from the person inside....that's really quite absurd to require that. 👎<//Review>

Their website says they close @ 2pm got there @12:32 and the girl working said she couldn’t help me because they close @12:30!!???
Like really?! 2 mins!!
They have no social media, their hours aren’t updated, this makes it very inconvenient for people that don’t live around the area driving out of their way to come here because the coffee is good. But costumer service not so much.</Text>

The fresh taste of the berries and the peanut butter just sets it off, topped with bananas and strawberries 😁. My brother loves their coffee and said it's got great flavor. Check this place our for great service and a  quick healthy snack or drink, it won't let you down.<//text>< pics>

We love this place! We have 3 Starbucks in our neighborhood to choose from but we choose this place, hands down. Great coffee/espresso and wonderful service from people who really know our names.</text>

Love this little drive thru coffee place. Coffee is very good and baristas are friendly and fast. They also have pastries, oatmeal, breakfast burritos and smoothies.</Review>

Little stand in a parking lot.  Definitely doesn't seem to live up to its hype or price tags.  Got a POG smoothie and was not impressed.  Smoothie tasted artificially sweet.  Just made with ocean spray juices and a lot of ice. Contemplated getting an acai bowl but decided against it after my disappointment with the smoothie.  Also read the reviews for the small bowl and knew I made the right decision!<//text>
<pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1513701259138, 'text': 'Aloha Bertha,\nWe are sorry that you had such a horrible experience at SHAKA Coffee. We did want to address your comments, though.\n1.    Thank you for mentioning our “hype”—we are proud of our 4.5 star rating on Yelp (133 reviews) https://www.yelp.com/biz/shaka-coffee-mesa-san-diego-2 and Google--one of the highest rated coffee shops in San Diego County! It’s unfortunate, however, that you skimmed past all our good reviews to concentrate on a single bad review (see #4).\n2.    Regarding our prices, they are lower than Starbucks on EVERY item although our costs are much higher (it costs a lot to ship Hawaiian coffee to the mainland!). We also use only the best ingredients in all our menu items, adding to our cost—Ghirardelli Chocolate, Monin syrups, Sambazon Acai, fresh fruit, etc.\n3.    We use 100% fruit puree w/ NO SUGAR ADDED in our smoothies. We do put OJ (not ocean spray) in our POG smoothie (because that’s how you make ‘em!), in addition to 100% guava and 100% passion fruit puree (neither are ocean spray).\n4.    Regarding your slamming of our Acai bowl...admittedly, you never ordered or tasted our acai bowl, but you read a bad review on it, so told everyone how bad it was. With that logic, you should have raved about how delicious it was because our good reviews outnumber the bad reviews at least 10-1 (while you were at it, you should have said how bad our breakfast burrito was, too—we got a bad review on that one in 2009 lmao).\nAnyway, we hope to impress you on your next visit!\nMahalo!'}< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dc0075c3e1978f:0xa93e503550a1a231</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Mr. mailo is a fair and honest man. Last week I had repairs and he very graciously took the job when all other places nearby said they were busy and didn’t even offer a card.
He finished the job quickly and at a reasonable price. I can’t think of one complaint visiting a mechanic. The man is very fair and will not exaggerate or take advantage of a situation. His word is his bond<//Text>

<Text>Mailo is a customer at the restaurant I work at down the street.. Los Molcajetes Restaurant.. so I decided to take my car to him. My car needed a whole new engine. It got swapped out in a week and any questions I have regarding the car he answers them. It was affordable and very professional work. No mickey mouse job. He is also a very honest mechanic. I will be back.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIz2BZvN3nEY11MYL9WnnIFtm25YrEIUxpoIDT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOA3PnQdhcnxxStqXTyAPRxsP8sbRwnSAFGqVjv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Text>The best service I've ever had in my life! If you need to fix your car you need to read this! Mailo is not only a great mechanic he is also one of the best human beings you will ever meet. My brother and I were headed from Phoenix to San Diego to visit family. A couple miles outside of Fontana, CA our serpentine belt, bearing, and bracket broke and our car overheated. It was Friday night past 8:30 pm and every mechanic we called around town wasn't picking up. Mailo answered our call, it was his wife's birthday and his shop was closed but he told us he would be happy to help us . We had our car towed to his shop and he drove down to his garage after hours to assure us that he could fix the car and everything would be ok. The next morning (Saturday) the part to fix our car arrived but the part company sent the wrong part. Mailo called all over and drove to other part stores to try and find us the part we needed. Nobody had what we needed to fix our car. It was Saturday and Mailo said the soonest anyone could get us the part would be the following Tuesday. Mailo didn't want us to miss spending time with our family so he had his son drive six hours through traffic to the only dealership that had the parts we needed. I was so blown away with how far Mailo and his team were going to help us out. While we were waiting for the parts to arrive Mailo took us out   with him and his wife to their favorite Mexican restaurant. He introduced us to his friends and the owner of the restaurant. Mailo paid for our meal and treated us like we were apart of his family. A couple hours later the part arrived and he had our car fixed very quickly, he could have charged us as much he wanted at that point and I would have gladly paid him. He gave us our bill and it was so reasonable for all the hassle he had to go through to help us. He is the best and most honest mechanic I've ever seen in my life! Mailo personally text us the next morning to check up on us and make sure the car and everything was running good. Mailo is a man of faith and is as good as they come, I would gladly drive an extra hundred miles to have Mailo look at my car the next time it needs work. I cannot say enough good things about Mailo's auto repair and his team. Thanks again Mailo!    - Ben Magnuson<//Text>< pictures>

Had a good experience with the staff here. They are friendly and very reasonable price. Needed a new engine and the price was amazing flat rate to put in my car no added fees. We are on a time crunch cause we are heading out of town and he said if he doesn’t have my car fixed by then he will give me a rental car for free so we don’t miss our trip. Definitely recommend<//text>

<review>Awesome people! They will not choke you out for your money- they charge you by the exact price and they're honest mechanics. It's a shame not every mechanic is honest about what's really wrong with the car. I'm so thankful the men who operate this place are unlike the corrupt society that unfortunately exists today. Would recommend to anyone :)<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>Incredibly amazing people. Very friendly and honest. It’s a very family oriented place, they greet you like a family member not just a customer. They offer low prices and will sometimes even go lower. They help you out to the fullest. Whatever you need, they’ll help. Need help with payments, or parts, or wanting to buy a car off of them, or whatever, they’ll help. They also sometimes offer food haha. They make sure everything is taken care of before you leave. They helped us out so much and we even bought a car off of them for a low price. Highly recommended 🏆< /Text><userid>109594325034276485700<//userid>< resp>

<Review>The best we have ever come across.  Honest, reliable.  Fast and dependable repairs.  Our truck broke down right off of the highway  6pm.
Called Mailo's and they took us in right away.  Needed a new water pump and thermostat.  One hour later we were ready to go.  No price gouging as usually happens in emergencies.  This is the place to go for any repairs.  Far better that over-priced auto repair chains.
Thank you once again.<//Review>< pictures>

The service is prompt and mechanics very informative. Although it may be difficult to cater to everyone's needs, patience is  not necessarily required  in this business. I was in & out with a friendly welcome and a efficiently repaired vehicle. THANK YOU M.A.P!   YOU ROCK THE I.E.<//Text>

<Date>1568837447802< /Date><Rate>1< /Rate><review>Worst experience I have ever had. If I could I would give this place no stars. I took my 1995 Toyota Tacoma there to have the fuel pump fixed and even after we told him we were sure it is the fuel pump he said he would run some tests first to be sure, which was fine at first, but it took him four (4) days for him to call me and tell me that he was sure the problem was definitely the fuel pump. Then it took him another day and half (1 1/2) to fix it. Once I finally got my truck back I realized the gas meter wasn't working anymore, it was showing empty even though the truck had half a tank before I took it to him. I went to fill the tank and it still showed empty. I told him about the gas meter showing empty and he told me he would need to order the sending unit because he noticed it was stuck at half tank when I took it to him. I explained that it wasn't stuck, I had filled the truck up not long ago and it was at half tank when I took it to his shop. He tried to brush it of and acted as if the sending unit did not work before I took it to him although it had been working fine and he told me he wouldn't be able to look at my truck to try to fix his mistake for another three (3) days. He charged me a total of three hundred and fifty dollars ($350) to change the fuel pump and he didn't even change the whole thing. Of course, I'm not sure where he ordered the part or how much the part vs the labor costed because they wouldn't give me a straight answer to my questions. His brother, Victor, would just tell me that Mailo is a very just and trustworthy person and that all the people in his neighborhood go to his shop and that he always provides good service for them. Victor also started talking about the rating he receives becuase all the people they know give them good reviews. Victor also tried to charge me an extra fifty dollars ($50) for an "official" receipt. He said it would be the taxes I would have to pay for the receipt, of course I'm not sure how true that is or how it actually works for the receipt, but that was my experience. Horrible, Mailo seemed nice, but the experience was the worst I've ever had.</review>< Pics>

I'm very grateful for this place. My car broke and they towed my car in. Very polite and professional. Being that I'm a women I'm always scarred of being taken advantage of when it comes to cars. They made me feel welcomed and safe. They took there time and explained everything to me. Highly recommend<//Text>

<username>Daniel Farias<//username><Time>1559823297081</Time><rating>5< /rating><review>So thankful that Mailo was able to help me out when I was in dire need of it. The radiator on my 99 Blazer busted and it was near 5 pm on Saturday. I didn't have another car to go buy a radiator and install it myself, I needed my car the next day. After searching through Yelp for a local and reliable shop, Mailo's shop came up 1st. I gave Mailo's a call and despite being scheduled to close in less than 2 hours, I was told to bring my car in.

As soon as I arrived Mailo and his crew began working on my car. Minutes later Mailo was on his way to pick up a new radiator (with a lifetime warranty). At 6:15 pm I was driving out, what an incredible job. Almost every shop I searched for was closed at 5pm, and I am truly grateful that Mailo took the time to help me out. If I ever need anymore work done, this will be the only place I go to.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

My mom had her car repaired here and he is very honest with you and will get you going. I brought my wife's car to him for an Air-Conditioning issue, another mechanic told me I would have to replace the whole AC-unit out. That will cost me over $10,000, he diagnosed the problem and advised me I only had to repair one of AC Lines. The repair work was less than $180 dollars, that was very reasonable for the work.
Like I said before he is an honest mechanic, he been in business for 32yrs and I know there are others who have been in business for more than that. But if you need a second opinion go to him, I'm glad I did.......< /review>

Mailo and his brother Victor are the best!! Late Saturday evening after they were closed, I called and Mailo was already at home but Victor was still at the shop. Mailo called him to let him know that I was on my way! Victor scanned my ABS system, showed me what it read, and cleared the codes for me!! He said they do not charge for scans, but after all of that I would not feel right not paying him something. 100% recommended great guys!!<//review>

Not good work, very rude and unprofessional. Also he overcharged me and he didn't even fix what he said he would. His son was also very rude to my girlfriend. He also had no urgency on fixing my car. Worst service ever.< /text>

Do your research ahead of time to look for a facility that will take your pets during an emergency situation. Do not go here. They know if they are open, chances are you will take your beloved pets to them and will provide their staff an opportunity to charge you procedure that they do not perform. I am so regretful that I took my boy here during his last moment to be with a bunch of crooks.<//Review>

Dr. Kramer, Dr. Black and Emily are absolute miracle workers. There is no doubt in my mind that my dog, Finnegan wouldn’t have survived if he went to any other emergency vet. They treated him with compassion and gave him as much love (if not more) as I would have. I’m so thankful for them and the entire AIMSS team. If you want the absolute best care for your animal, don’t go anywhere else. 5+++ stars.<//Review>

<review>If you want your beloved pet die due to negligence and at the same time receive a CPR charge of $1030 that the medical staff agreed not to do and did not do, then bring your pet here. Our 16-year old was having a cardiac arrest. Five minutes later Dr. Leah Kramer came out and asked if we wanted them to perform CPR. We asked for their opinion. Dr. Leah Kramer recommend  against it because she found a large tumor in his throat that completely blocked his airway. We followed their recommendation and painfully told them not to perform the CPR. We asked if we could be with him during his last moments. They said we could not due to Covid protocols. Two minutes later, we were informed of his passing.
We spent 15 minutes with our boy in the private room then did the financial check out. After paying, we found out the charge was close to $1,500 which included the CPR charge of $1,030. My wife asked the receptionist to refund the CPR charge since it was not performed. She said she could not do it because the payment was being processed by a third party. She told us to wait for a day or two for the processing to complete then would refund the $1,030 to us. My wife asked for the treating doctor's name and was told her name was Leah Kramer. At that time Dr. Kramer passed by and told my wife: "I will make sure the refund will be processed."
A week later, my wife called and talked to the receptionist. The receptionist said she does not recall any refund conversation. My wife asked if she could talk to Dr. Kramer. The receptionist said Dr. Kramer no longer works here. We now have to contact our credit card company for their help.
What happened was witnessed by many. We know through disputes or small-claim legal process that we will get our refund back. My only question is: Why does AIMSS operate like this?
My advice to all pet owners and lovers out there is to do your research ahead of time to look for an emergency facility other than AIMSS for your beloved pets. It's hard to find one during this pandemic time. This AIMSS hospital knows that and they intend to open their facility to take advantage of your animal-love situation.
We are very regretful that we put my boy in their hands during his last moment. We are truly sorry our love.< /review>< Pics>

<date>1620590586354<//date><rating>1< /rating><Text>This place is a scam! My dog wasn’t feeling well, and they kept her overnight. The next day they suggested surgery for a price FAR more than we anticipated. We didn’t have to look far before we found a place to do the same thing for a fraction of the cost. They were fine with us taking her to our other vet, but days later were charged for our overnight stay the same amount as the entire surgery at the other place. They charged my wife’s scratch account without an invoice provided  or anything. We had to inquire if there was a mistake because this price can’t be right.  They took advantage of us in a venerable place.<//Text>< pics>

I called to inquire about emergency services and was disappointed by the lack of help from the person that answered. We chose to go to a different hospital for out cat's emergency as a result.

I told the person that answered the phone (after a long wait) that my cat has a medical emergency and she rudely asked "well what is it."

I told her the issue and that based on what I saw online it's supposed to be checked on immediately to ensure no further damage occurs.

The person condescendingly responded "oh so you just heard that online."

The obvious implication was that I was overreacting based on "rumors" online.

But that's the point of calling a hospital!

If I wasn't concerned based on my research we would not have called the hospital to find out how to bring our cat in for immediate treatment.

If it's not a big deal and I shouldn't worry about it, how am I supposed to know that? I am not the vet, you are!

This was a very disappointing experience in a time of distress for my cat and me.

We took our cat to another hospital and they were able to run tests immediately to determine the cause of the issue and get it resolved. They were just as concerned as I was about the condition because of their knowledge of what the condition could imply similar to what I had read online.

AIMSS should focus on helping patients determine whether something is truly an emergency or not instead of belittling their patients for being concerned about medical emergencies. We are not vets, you are.< /text>

This is an overall good place. My dog was having a lot of pain and this is the only place that accepts walk in appointments. They were very thorough with his examination and even though I was not able to be in there with him it is very reassuring that we have a place to go for emergencies. The vet was very responsive and has followed up a lot. The only bad thing is that they do sometimes have communication issues That can be very frustrating. Its understandable given that they provide services for a lot of animals so they are bound to be scattered sometimes but I get how some owners would get very upset. I didn't get the update that i was supposed to when my dog had to stay overnight. I had to call them at 12:00 am after not knowing much  and when he was ready to get picked up they told me to call them at 4:00. When I did they told me not to call that they would call me and that they had no update on my dog, I think they mistook the dog I was referring too as well. The person on the phone clearly just wanted to hang up on me which I found very funny because they called me back 15 min after saying that he was ready to get picked up. They are probably just dealing with a lot but I think the overall care is good and its the only option for 24 hr care.<//Text>

Won't ever take my dog here again!

Doctor Mackenzie said it was just the toe nail, she sent a firm to fill out and we signed it and she billed us $350 for it. Went to pick her up and they amputated the whole toe without our consent and tried to bill is another $650.

She lied and said she did try to call us, when we said she didn't, she back tracked and said well it was an emergency.

We were disputing both the missing toe and the additional $650. She quickly said " I guess I won't make any money then" and reduced the bill to $300.

We said the nurse didn't give us the medication when we picked her up and to remove the medication from the bill.

She removed $50 from the $300 then added a $100 "miscellaneous" charge making the $300...$350.

Fair warning...Vindictive and shady!<//text>

This is our puppy’s 2nd visit to this ER. The first time was from an infected bite wound from another puppy during play and the experience was good at their old location. However, we took our 7lb puppy to this ER for treatment of a potential poisoning last night, but rather than test immediately, the staff was incapable of subduing said small lethargic dog and had to sedate him 4 times to get a cone on him...at which point what he had consumed had possibly already passed since 7+ hours had passed since we initially arrived at their office. The discharge instructions and follow up instructions were MOSTLY paragraphs of complaints about his behavior and how he should be taken to a behaviorist with only a short line pertaining to the actual reason we took him to the ER. Our puppy hasn’t had complaints the last time we visited here nor from his normal vet so it’s possible this behavior was due to his sick state or how he was handled in this ER. It would be absurd taking your human kid to the ER and having a doctor give you discharge papers with just behavioral complaints about the kid (while he’s sick and drugged) and how to treat those behavior problems so he behaves better in the ER instead of actual information relevant to his illness. I don’t see why this is acceptable discharge instructions from a pet ER. Our puppy was clearly traumatized from the experience as well and is still recovering.</Text>

Dr. Kate and staff took care of me/my dog’s crisis immediately. I was in a panic and I was not at my best; they were calm, professional and caring.
Dr. Kate and staff: thank you for keeping my Rascal safe, thank you for your quick diagnosis and treatment. Thank you for being there.
I am telling my friends and neighbors that you are my first call if I ever find my four-legged friend in crisis again.
Thank you</Review>

<text>AIMSS is horribly understaffed and frantic (with technicians and front desk doing the best that they can) and you will not be able to get anyone on the phone for hours if you bring your pet to be seen. The owner of this vet hospital needs to staff properly. They had one veterinarian there the night I went to handle all cases - emergency and critical.

Horrifyingly, that vet decided that she would put my dog under, without my consent, to treat. She placed a muzzle on him (wound was on his snout) and put him under without giving me a call to discuss whether he, a senior dog, reacted well to sedation or had ever had a bad experience. Their team claimed there was consent because the medication was on the invoice that I agreed to pay (as costing $0.00). My dog does not react well to sedation or reverse sedation and he has been ill for 3 days since seeing the vet at AIMSS. They will not treat your animal well - their lack of communication with owners does not allow for best practice (or even standard practice) veterinary medicine to happen here.</text>< Pictures>

Terrible communication about what was going on inside and incredibly slow. Waited 1.5 hours outside and then another 2 while my dog was inside only to find out she had only had basic exam by that point. The vet I talked to was super lovely and knowledgeable but overall a very upsetting experience due to poor communication and incredibly slow wait times. When I decided not to go through with the recommended treatment (seemed like overkill), it also took a while and confusing calls to get my dog back.</Review>

The only silver lining here is Dr. Kramer who treated my dog Sophie very kindly and made sure that she was comfortable crossing over the rainbow bridge.  The horrible part is I paid for my pets remains to be mailed to me.  The hospital charged me $500 which was fully paid last October.  It's been 2 months and I STILL have not received my pet's remains.  I call and follow-up every week and they keep saying they will call back but THEY NEVER DID.  Plus their receptionist has ZERO customer service skills. VERY UNRESPONSIVE, VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.</Text>

Not emergency place. Got there middle of night and told shift too busy with severe problems. Day vets don’t come til 9am weekdays (told 7am). Waited in car as told per Covid. Called twice to check. 12+ hours nobody could see me. My dog was vomiting many times and diarrhea all day so I’d consider it emergency. They are understaffed. Drive to a hospital not a place with ONE vet. I went to SPCA 3 blocks away and was seen immediately. Pancreatitis, bloody diarrhea, and blocked intestines. He would have died waiting here.< /text>

I discovered at 1AM that my hatchling ball python had managed to dislodge athletic tape in his enclosure that I was using to hold the thermostat probe in place (dumb move on my part using tape; I took all of it out immediately and now use aquarium-safe silicone sealant). He got it stuck to his scales, and it wouldn't come off even with a warm bath. I was scared it might prevent him from excreting, and decided to see a vet.

To my knowledge, AIMSS doesn't normally see reptiles but when I called the receptionist was very polite and professional, and they offered to see him anyways. They were very prompt, got it off quickly, and didn't overcharge me at all.

I can't speak for anyone else's experience, but if mine is a standard example then I would fully expect the negative reviews here have more to do with the pet owners than AIMSS. This is a solid, professional clinic of highly trained experts.

I fully endorse AIMSS and would happily go back if needed!<//text>

<text>I've used this emergency clinic (and some of their specialty services) several times over the years always with good results and professional, competent service, but I had a really bad experience here yesterday. I don't want to single out any one person as it seems more like an institutional problem.

I brought in my older dog who was coughing and breathing more than 60 times/minute. They took him in as an emergency, but then things really slowed down. I didn't hear from the doctor for over an hour, and then only to tell me that he needed xrays and blood work. Of course he did, he was very sick! Then another 2 hour wait to tell me the xrays and blood work were done and was told the xray showed a tumor and maybe heart failure but the doctor wanted an outside radiologist to make a more expert interpretation and this was being asked for STAT. Another 3 1/2 hour wait to be told that the radiologist says he has pneumonia, no tumor, no heart failure. By now he's been there for more than 7 hours. By the time they discharge him at 8 hours, he had not received any medications or any fluids, although the doctor says she gave him a bowl of water at some point.

When I expressed my unhappiness that he had not received any treatment and the STAT read on the xray took 3 1/2 hours, the doctor agreed to give him his first dose of ORAL antibiotics rather than having me give it to him at home. If he has such a severe pneumonia that it looks like a tumor on xray shouldn't he be getting IV antibiotics and fluids?

Every conversation I had with the doctor was pleasant and I felt she really cared about my dog and was trying her best to get him taken care of. So where was the problem? It seemed to me that the clinic was extremely understaffed, at least from what I could see of the front desk and the very few nurses or techs who were doing intake. We were there mid day (11am-7pm) on a Saturday, which I would think would be an important staffing period for the only emergency vet in the city. Also, when I got my dog home, he had to pee for a very long time, and was incredibly thirsty which made me think he hadn't been taken out or given much water during his 8 hours there. The discharge nurse even told me his labs looked like he was dehydrated! So why no fluids?

One other bit of weirdness: when I got to the clinic there were several large puddles of blood and blood splattered all along the sidewalk in front of the door. Despite watching multiple staff members coming in and out of the door and literally stepping over the puddles, nobody cleaned up the blood for hours! That gave me the feeling that they just don't really care and don't have much enthusiasm for their work environment or respect for their customers. It's sad. Management needs to read all of these one star reviews and get their act together.</text>< response>

Our regular vet didn't have the ability to diagnose or help our dog. We called around looking for someone who could help our dog right away and had the capability and equipment to diagnose and treat him. AIMSS was the only true emergency pet hospital with the ability to help our pet right away. We called and told them what was happening and they were ready to take him right away - this is truly rare as we called so many places. They gave our pet excellent care and were able to find out what was wrong and came up with a plan for care. They communicated what was happening throughout and gave us answers and options and addressed our worries and concerns. I can't speak more highly of their care and expertise. I will forever be grateful for the care and attention they showed our dog and the sensitivity to us wanting excellent care for our pet and to know what was happening a critical moment. Dr. Kramer & Dr. Kelly were amazing.< /Review>

<user>117250586525147747219</user><text>I have gone to AIMSS for two separate situations for my dog and both times I've been happy with the service. The most recent, in an emergency situation, I was very happy with the staff, their responsiveness and empathy to me and my pet. All of the staff I spoke to clearly cared about their patients and honestly, me. I was stressed out and got a little snappy with the staff, they never snapped back at me even though I probably deserved it, but only worked to make me feel reassured and said that they're there for me as well as my dog. It was rare to hear this, and I was impressed.< /text><Rate>5< /Rate><user_name>Sheena Heikkila<//user_name>< GmapID>

I came here as my pup got her toe caught in the escalator. We came on a Saturday evening and didnt hear back from a Vet until midnight where they first said they needed my pup to stay over night to get stitches. Turns out they changed their mind the next morning and had a change of plans where we needed to wait another night for a surgeon since it was a serious wound. Why couldnt they determine this initially? The vet made it seem like it would be best for my pup to stay another night rather than have her come home where she is more comfortable. I was not going to pay a night in the ER nor have her be stuck there cold and sad so I took her home with meds and took her to another reliable Vet. Beware!< /text>

The vets and staff here are the best! My dog suffered for over a year with multiple misdiagnosis from other vets in the city. They immediately found the issue. He is now healthy and living his best life. Many thanks!</text>

<Review>I had my first experience at this hospital this morning.  Due to the pandemic, I obviously could not go inside which is pretty traumatic when your baby is broken but clearly appropriate for the situation.  My husband called so they knew we were on our way.  We called again when we got to their parking lot and the nurse came out swiftly and intercepted my baby boy.  I was called again by the front staff to authorize a payments for the test(s) they suggested.  I was called by the doctor and she had explained everything that was happening and was very informative, in addition, she also handled my anxiety (which for me is pretty unheard of).  I was again called to authorize the payment of his exam.  I did not feel price gouged at all.  Incredibly reasonably priced, in fact, even less then I've paid elsewhere in past.  The nurse came back out to bring me my boy and was totally compassionate and empathetic as well as very knowledgeable.  I always forget to ask a doctor one thing or another and it was so refreshing to be able to ask the nurse when she came back out and to get solid answers.  Thank you so much AIMS for taking care of my little, fluffy, scared and confused boy this morning!!!   I am eternally grateful!  It's also such a relief to know that if we have another emergency, I know exactly where to go.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you.</Review>< Response>

<rating>5</rating><text>I went here with my cat Atlas when I had nowhere else to go. He had a partial intestine obstruction, and let me tell you, I was a wreck after a previous vet refused to even show me the test results, and told me he'd pass it on his own.

When he didn't get better, I panicked and went to aimss. Everyone there genuinely cared for Atlas. I was seen within 45 minutes, and received an update almost immediately after check in with plans for an xray. Then, the doctor herself called in and gave me a complete run down of what happened, and how he was feeling, and what to do. Of course, he needed surgery, and I was devastated. The entire team there reassured me that we were both going to be taken care of, both physically and financially. I've never felt more secure and trusting in such a terrifying moment, and my fur baby was well taken care of.

The surgery was done well into the evening, and even though it ended around midnight, the doctor herself still called me to give me an update and really reassure me that he would be okay. I'm still waiting to discharge him when he's recovered, but this is the first time in over a week where I feel calm, and I feel like Atlas is being loved and cared for.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x8085875dcb39861f:0x8b40d8bbee60ad51<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Her pup had a terrible accident on his paw as he ran down the outside stairs, his nail got caught on our wooden step and 80 percent of his front claw ripped off.  Mom's vet was closed and Animal Internal Medicine was open so we went! Super professional on the phone, excellent curb side service is being offered and they we're able to see us as soon as possible. We waited about 2 hours total the first time. We had to do a follow-up where we just called in to see the workload and also waited about 2 hours.

Honestly, great service! Brilliant Vets and staff all working together to help all our fur babies! So happy we found a gem in the city that is truly making a difference.

Truly they made a horrible experience bearable.

<review>Truly a place that cares! Took our 15 yr old beagle to 3 other vets before this one and they finally gave us candid advice. They were honest and upfront and aren't money-making machines like the others. We unfortunately had to put our dog down and they were super accommodating. Unlike the other vets (given Corona), they let us come into the room and be with him during his last moments. Definitely will be coming back with our other dogs. Dr. Katharine Andres is professional and gentle, highly recommend!</review>< user>

Poor poor poor communication!!!! We had the same experience as a number of people who left detailed reviews. After taking our cat there at 3.30pm, we end up having to pick her up at 9.30 pm to drive her to another emergency vet. I can only imagine how difficult their job is, but I felt as though the people we talked with seemed to have a hard time understanding that we are worried family members who are left out in the dark with no way of knowing what was or was not being done to furry daughter.<//Text>

<text>I know that the reviews on AIMSS are all over the map because I looked them myself before taking my dog here for an eye infection, but my experience was ultimately just fine.

My dog developed an eye infection on a Sunday so most vets were closed. On Monday morning I started calling around, but because of COVID vets are impacted and either didn't have any availability same-day or weren't taking new patients. I learned that AIMSS is essentially an Urgent Care type of place and that I could get him in to see a doctor same-day with the knowledge that that type of service would cost $120. My dog's eye infection was bad enough by that Monday morning to warrant seeing a doctor that day and I thought the cost was reasonable.

When I arrived I did find it difficult to see the place (it's behind a big tree) and also difficult to see their parking lot, which is immediately adjacent to their building - between them and the auto body shop next door. I will say that the staff they have answering general phone calls are pretty blunt and uncaring. When I didn't see the parking lot and parked just beyond the auto body shop I called and they asked me to park in the parking lot. When I parked in the parking lot and called they asked me to take my dog to the front door. All of that didn't generate a lot of confidence, but at that point I was there and took the risk.

From then on I'd say that I was happy with the service I received. I got a phone call within 40 minutes of the handover asking a few more questions about my dog's symptoms before the doctor saw him. A reasonable amount of time later I got a call from the doctor herself with a diagnosis. Then a call from a tech with discharge instructions. They handed my dog back to me within 2 hours of me dropping him off, maybe even 1.5 hours. The techs and the doctor were much nicer on the phone and explained everything thoroughly.

Overall I'm happy with the experience. If I were to ask them to make one change it would be to train their general office staff (who answer general phone calls) on being a bit warmer and empathetic with the customers and potential customers who call in.<//text>< Pics>

<review>I will never go there anymore and I don't recommend anyone go there. All they want is money. Charging 700 dollars just for eye and the doctor was soooooo unprofessional. I sat in the car for 2hours at least just to waiting for my pet. And they refused to save the pet and give the pet any treatment or medicine, just because you don't wanna do the PCR. They are like forcing you to do all the treatment and all the diagnoses which is unnecessary and waste of money. Please don't go there anymore. AWFUL EXPERIENCE AND THEY ARE REFUSING TO SAVING PETS AND REFUSING GIVE PATIENTS MEDICINE AND TREATMENT TO SAVE THEIR PETS. Don’t go it and it is horrible.< /review>< pics>

We brought our sick kitten here and ran into a huge amount of communications issues with the team there. Everyone we spoke with either gave us different answered about what to expect or left out important details. We now feel like we were swindled out of $600 because we were given half truths about what was needed and when we could expect results. We realize now we paid for tests that we won’t get results for until it’s too late.  Ask A LOT of questions if you go.

I wish we read other similar reviews before taking him here.< /text>

<text>They were responsive, understanding, and caring. My cat went in looking as sick as I have ever seen him, and came out in a few hours, perhaps not yet healthy, but getting better, and we know what the problem is and have a path forward. They gave me an appointment quickly even in the times of Covid-19. The only thing that knocks them down to four stars was that I was there far longer than expected because of an emergency. That, in and of itself, wasn't the issue, emergencies should come first. What knocks off the star is that no one kept me informed that was going on and I couldn't tell what was happening from my car in the parking lot (because of the pandemic). "We'll call you in half an hour" turned into a several hour wait without warning or explanation until I called them after a couple hours.<//text>< pics>

If you love your pet, please take them somewhere else.

I wish I would have read the reviews before coming here. My dog had an elevated heart rate and was at risk of cardiac arrest and so I felt it too late to take him out of here and somewhere else. I had a hard time understanding whether these people wanted to take care of my dog or wanted to extract as much cash from me as possible.

If I could write a script or how to take advantage of somebody to get the most money out of someone in an emergency situation, the doc here followed it to the letter.

My dog is alive, but did not receive treatment beyond the expensive tests they were running for nearly five hours after getting here while having a heart rate of 250 beats per minute.

The staff has an alarming lack of empathy, and the communication is broken at best. Ambiguity with which this week and the oh so upfront palpable 'give me all your money' attitude is upsetting to say the least.

They took advantage of me in an emotionally vulnerable state. While I was waiting in my car to see what would happen I contacted a friend of mine who also had an unfortunate run in with this place.

Update: I brought my dog in for a follow-up appointment this morning to have an ultrasound. The nurse not only thought I was dropping off a cat, but she did not change the expression on her face once, hardly bent down, did not invite my dog inside, but just started dragging him by the neck to take him inside to give him the ultrasound. This behavior is completely deplorable. I immediately regret that I brought him back here instead of getting a lawyer to get some of my money back.

I give 2 stars because my dog is alive. The doctor seems to know what she is talking about, although her salesmanship is her stronger skill.</Review>

<Text>I have add to go into AIMSS a few times recently. Including when my pup most likely got into a toxic plant and then when he had an outsize reaction to a medicine for worms. The staff and doctors are kind and competent. It is too bad that with COVID I could not go in with my dog but they call during the exam and I would certainly feel confident taking him there again.</Text><Time>1602460300849<//Time><Resp>None< /Resp><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

The ONLY 24 hours emergency vet left in San Francisco-  will you wait, yes but not only are they professional but they are basically saving the lives of animals while no other vet in the city is open.  10 stars for being available for all our pets that don't get sick on a 9-5 schedule.< /review>

This was the only emergency pet hospital open in SF on Sunday evening when we needed to take my puppy that apparently ingested drugs off the streets of San Francisco to emergency. To say the least, we were extremely scared. He’s less than one years old miniature Pomeranian. After waiting 1.5 hrs, I called to check in as they said they would treat him right away. Each person I spoke to communicated a different thing to me that was not adding up - including the admin, nurse, and even the doctor. I asked simple questions like: when are you going to treat my dog it’s been 1.5 hrs already and I’ve now been told it’ll be another 1hr+ now, why is there such a lack of communication, what does “he’s stable” mean, when do you think you’ll be able to treat him I’m very concerned that he’s not comfortable waiting for treatment there, etc. The nurse diminished my concern repeatedly by saying my dog was not a priority compared to the other cases and attempting to teach me about what triage means as if relevant to my concern. Then, she gave me an ultimatum that if I didn’t want to wait or wasn’t happy with the service I could take my dog elsewhere - as if I had a choice and this wasn’t an emergency situation. She said “so what’ll it be? You want us to treat your dog or not?” Again, still wasn’t clear on how or when they were going to treat my puppy. How does it help to provide general answers with no specific info or process to concerned dog owners that adore their pets and cannot speak for themselves?

This is late at night, of course during COVID so we also can’t be with our little one, and we are sitting in our car out front waiting this whole time. There is obvious frustration that will arise and again, there was a total miscommunication between staff. After a little over 2.5 hrs of waiting, the doctor then called saying they finally treated our dog and then proceeded to threatened me that if I wanted to come back to ever receive service there that I have to be respectful. I explained to her pretty calmly that I felt the nurse was being incredibly insensitive and wasn’t speaking to me respectfully and that honestly I hope not to come back again because this was an emergency situation where this was the only emergency open and all I wanted was to understand when and how my dog would be treated because I love my dog. Then, in our dogs discharge documents, the doctor who was apparently extremely busy and couldn’t treat my dog for 2.5+ hrs, had the time to write a very disrespectful and long note personally attacking me calling me a “trantruming child.” FYI  “trantruming” is not a word - it’s a misspelling, “Doctor.” And, thanks for obviously taking your stress out on your already stressed our clients who are paying a ridiculous premium to get emergency care for their innocent animals. It’s incredibly unprofessional to put a personal attack in the discharge documents for my dog which should outline how I care for him after treatment! How could you feel ok doing such a thing as a Doctor even after already threatening your client on the phone?

I cried in the car holding my dog that was passed out in my arms after the whole situation. I couldn’t believe how this emergency situation to help my puppy became such an intense personal attack on me.< /text>

< Review>
Took my older dog in very sick late at night, as they were the only one in the area not at capacity. They are more expensive than others (private practice). Unfortunately, they're horrible. The doctor told us what she thought was wrong and had him admitted for aspiration pneumonia and another issue. She explained what they needed to do and why. I agreed but asked they wait on the ultrasound. She agreed. She told us that we were going to be contacted between 8 and 10 the next morning by the doctor for an update and results of some blood work, then again around 6 in the evening and that we can call anytime, as many times as we want to, just to check on him. No problem. Sounds great. Signed paperwork virtually. Since we weren't allowed inside because of COVID-19. I'm all for their protective procedures. The other lady who takes care of the front desk stuff was supposed to send me paperwork to sign without the ultrasound on it. Nothing. Then came morning.

8am. No call. 10am. No call. I call to check and they say the doctors have a couple of critical patients and haven't made rounds on current patients yet. Ok. Call at 12. Get attitude and the same excuse. Call at 2. Get more attitude and the same excuse. Call at 3:30 and get even more attitude and the same excuse. Now I'm wondering if they're even treating him and I start questioning them about if they're even treating him and what the hell is going on. I talk to the nurse and told her what I was told by the night doctor before leaving. Then she starts to argue with me because she says that's not how they do things and that no news is good news and I just have to trust them. I've never even been there before so how can I when I was told one thing and they can't even have a doctor call me after him being there for 14 hours with no communication. Then I was told they're not sure why she said that but that's not how they work. I told her that they need to 'school' the overnight doctor about the procedure. She said she can't do that but she can teach or advise her. I told her its the same thing, she said its not. 🤦‍♀️ The last straw of excuses was when she said something and I told her 'so what. Is this because he isn't a regular patient there and the others are?' She got quiet for a moment and then said 'let me see if I can get the doctor on the phone.' Then the doctor came on, gave me some information, answered my questions, and then proceeded to tell me that the ultrasound I asked them to hold off on wouldn't have given them any information about his condition because it doesn't tell you what they needed to know. I'm thinking ok, so you tried to get me to agree to a $600 ultrasound that would have done me no good to find out anything related to my dogs condition.  I had enough. The doc agreed to see if he will eat and, if so. He will go home and see his primary for follow up xrays and that she would send the records to his regular vet immediately. I picked him up that evening and called his vet the next day. Of course, no one sent the records. My vets office had to call over to ask for them. I was supposed to receive a call the next morning to talk about a hefty refund of what I was charged for but they didn't do (he was ok to come home earlier than they said he would be). Never got a call from anyone. I'm going to check my credit card statement to make sure that they issued the promised refund. If they did, cool. If they didn't, they'll be receiving another call from me, except I won't be so patient this time.

Needless to say, I will never take my dogs there again, nor will I recommend them to anyone. Be wary of this veterinary practice.</Review>

This was the only emergency pet hospital open in SF on Sunday evening when we needed to take my puppy that apparently ingested drugs off the streets of San Francisco to emergency. To say the least, we were extremely scared. He’s less than one years old miniature Pomeranian. After waiting 1.5 hrs, I called to check in as they said they would treat him right away.

They helped my sick cat in the middle of the night, the vet was really helpful and empathetic. It's a bit expensive to have a sick cat and they were considerate of costs too and there were no surprises.

Update: my sick cat got an extra seven months of life because of the medical help she got from the wonderful vet at AIMSS. Our cat was in really good shape, humor and spirit and brought us a lot of joy between leaving the hospital and her recent passing away. Due to covid she spent almost that whole time with me everyday, and I really appreciate it and I know she did too. Our vet also helped our cat to be comfortable for her final hours while the tests determined she couldn't realistically recover, letting us say goodbye. It's hard to run this place during Covid but they are making it work and that had a big impact on us. I was happy to see all the other animals going home while we were there.</review>

AIMS(doctors and nurses), listened to my explanations of my dogs changed behavior and pain. Dogs exhibit strange behavior when in pain only obvious to their owners that something is very wrong. They asked questions and were kind and thorough.

They did multiple tests, blood work, ultra sound and X Ray, over 24 hours, not giving up until they found a diagnosis. I was right and they were right, they found a serious injury in my dog’s spine. They kept me posted on each test while I waited anxiously at home. My dog is now on bed rest with medications to keep him comfortable and heal him.

I arrived at AIMS a few hours after having taken my pet to a different emergency service(SPCA on Fillmore). The previous hospital had been dismissive of my dog’s pain. They explained away and dismissed my reasoning of something being seriously wrong with my dog. The contrast in the hospitals is shocking to me.

Competent doctors, nurses and staff who listen, are kind and put the animals health first. They are also responsive and answer questions over the phone.

AIMS, thank you for taking care of my best friend.<//Text>

THEY ARE PROFESSIONAL SCAMMERS
Only 1 star because they’re 24/7

To make a long story short my dog sprained his ankle took him in they tried charging me 1500 I said no they said 480 JUST FOR X-RAY and pain meds. Doc says rest him for a week. Next morning after got an email saying he need surgery. For small fracture I tried calling but no answer. Did my own research and it’s a barely a thin line he’ll recover from In 2 weeks.< /Review>

I came here as a walk in and was treated very poorly. I left as soon as the mean lady in the front was disrespectful and unprofessional.

Also a customer outside told me they were really impolite and over charged her for thousands extra.

My sick kittens deserve decent treatment. I can’t be assured that mean people will provide that to them.<//Review>

<review>Cruel. Cold. Incompetent.

All of these added up to the absolute worst, most painful experience of my life, this May of 2020.

Cruel:

I was referred to AIMMS by my regular vet, SF SPCA (because of them referring me here I will no longer use them either). My dog was in pulmonary distress, and AIMMS admitted her. For two days she stayed there, and being in the middle of the pandemic I couldn’t even visit her (this I understood, it just made everything worse).

Two days later she was sent home, with four different medications to be administered at different times every day. Upon my arrival home I was greeted with the paid receipt in my email: Over $8,000. Yes. EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS. As long as she was feeling better, I didn’t care about the money. She is my soulmate, and you cannot put a price on that. I was determined to faithfully administer her medicine, making sure the remainder of her beautiful life was safe and comfortable.

Unfortunately, back at home it was abundantly clear that my little girl was still in distress. She was shaking, lethargic and unable to hold her bladder. I called AIMMS again and they advised me to bring her back immediately.

After waiting, forever it seemed, outside to receive the vet’s phone call from just inside the office, I was told there were a few things they could do, including adding more medications, running a urinalysis, etc. By then I HAD to ask if there was really any point to this. The vet hemmed, hawed and provided no real helpful information.

Without going into the painful details, after numerous calls to family and friends, I had to make the impossible decision to say goodbye, and put my best little friend to sleep. I have never cried more, and I do to this day. What made it worse is knowing that she had been put through hell for the last two days. WHY did they do this when it was clear she was not going to make it? Hence, DOWNRIGHT CRUEL.

Cold:

I was allowed in for the euthanasia procedure. It was in a cold room, with an equally cold female vet. I was crying so hard I could barely stand, holding my little girl and saying goodbye. When it was time, I was given no explanation of what to expect, other than “she’s going to get sleepy.” She DIDN’T get sleepy. Instead, she simply collapsed on the cold steel table, at which point the vet simply said, “She’s gone.” She then began a matter-of-fact discussion with the friend I had called to be with me on how much more “humane” we are to our pets than to each other. I had to scream, “SHUT UP, PLEASE!!!” while I held on to my girl's lifeless body, erupting in convulsive tears. My girl was indeed gone. I was inconsolable. The vet was just COLD.

Incompetent:

I was told to call the following week to tell them what was to be inscribed on my girl’s urn after her cremation. I called, told them, and had them read it back to me to make sure I got it right. Two weeks later, I retrieved the urn. I fell apart all over again. After many moments, crying in the car with my friend who brought me, I opened the cardboard box to see the actual wooden urn, only to realize they had MISSPELLED the inscription! Talk about insult to injury. Talk about shear INCOMPETENCE.

And, in fact, the close friend who brought me to pick up her remains admitted to me later that he had an equally horrible experience there resulting in his cat being put to sleep. He didn’t tell me at the time because he knew how devastated I was.

In closing, I can only say beware. Just drive by this place and you’ll witness what a dump it is from the exterior. You can be assured that the interior is just as bad. The staff is neither caring nor compassionate. My little pup died a horrible death at the hands of these people, and she should not have had to go through the hell they put her through.

And, to add even more pain, upon arriving back home, without my little girl, there was yet another paid receipt awaiting me. I couldn’t even look at it. I just trashed it.

This veterinarian DOES NOT deserve your business. PLEASE AVOID!< /review>< user_id>

<text>We came in with our dog which was obviously in pain, he was examined and sent home with no resolution (we paid hundreds of dollars for that), apparently he wasn’t thoroughly examined... when we got home we figured the pain was coming from his mouth, called back and asked if his mouth was examined (it wasn’t). He stayed over the night at the hospital and we called the next morning to see how he’s doing - no response. The veterinarian called before starting the surgery in his mouth, we asked questions and she was very rude and angry and eventually slammed the phone on us. After the surgery no one called to see how he’s doing. Would never recommend this place neither for humans nor pets. We paid so much for really abusive service :(< /text>< pics>

Where to begin...
I paid $500+ for an x-ray because I believed my dog had a broken leg. Then, they tell me to see a specialist. Basically paid $500+ for them to tell me what is pretty obvious. I could've gone to a specialist directly rather than having to pay the extra $500+. My dog was limping, I did not need an x-ray to tell it was broken. This establishment is greedy and unconcerned about the well being of my pet. I heard my dog screaming on the phone and when I asked if it was my dog, the nurse said, yes, I am so sorry you had to hear that. 20mins later I get another phone call saying that it wasn't my dog that was screaming, it was actually someone else's. Obviously a lie. Furthermore, the staff is so rude. Like other reviews, the staff are just disgusting people. I call for my dog's x-ray several times because I wanted to send it to spca, in order to get an estimate on the surgery. I had to call them 4 times to finally get it. Lets not forget that on the fourth time I called, the staff just hung up on me before I got the chance to ask when I would get the images. Sending a scan of an x-ray should take 5mins. The staff and vet are so incompetent, it hurts my brain to think that this establishment is still running. Finally, I get a call that my dog will be ready soon and that they would call me when I can pick up my dog. I ended up checking back at midnight to ask if my dog is ready. They said she was ready a long time ago. I didn't want to start an argument with the staff so I sucked it up and drove down there to pick up my dog. I got there at 12:30am. I finally got my dog at 1:30am. I waited in my car for an hour, even though they said she was ready to be picked up. The staff and doctor at this establishment are genuinely dumb. I have nothing good to say about this place.<//Text>

Wonderful staff! I thought my only Chihuahua child was choking and ran over to the pet hospital on a Saturday night (they are open 24/7). The staff took him back right away had him tested and treated quickly. They understood, as his mother, I was a anxious and scared my little guy wasn't going to make it... And they took the time to explain everything multiple times without judgement to make sure I understood the severity of his condition and treatment plan. He had a xray, blood and stool tests, and was seen home with medication and treatment plan. They gave me all the instructions in writing and we're happy to keep my Chihuahuas primary care informed. They called me three times to check on him...and with the treatment provided, my little guy is back to his tail wagging self! My Aunt was shocked when I told her I paid $1000...but if it was her child... I don't think she would have been so shocked. Thank you for all that you did! Chaos is doing great!</review>

I'm really frustrated with the experience they have provided. First, they are extremely expensive and have a huge mark up for emergency room services which is understandable but they move with 0 urgency. I came in for an emergency room visit on Thursday night and had 2 panels done for my dog. Come Monday I have heard nothing from them, I call them and they tell me one of the panels still hadn't been completed but the other was finished but no one called to give me the results. She said she would try to get a vet to speak with me and never heard back again. I have to call again the following day on Tuesday because they still didn't bother reaching out to me over the phone or even a simple email telling me the results of the completed panels.

I would never come back to this hospital again if possible.</Review>

<review>Came in for my hamster’s emergency. She was bleeding. We waited outside in the cold for over an hour and watched as nurses took in other people or went home. We asked about the situation twice and they said they wouldn’t allow us in (due to Covid-19) and that a nurse will take care of us once she finished a medication. Waited another half hour and nothing. No further communication. Some other people were taken care of right as they arrived though! Terrible service and they don’t have small animal specialists.< /review>< Rate>

Dr. Williamson and staff at AIMSS saved/extended my cat's life. Kitty may be down to 2-3 lives, but still kicking and having a good quality life. Thanks all!< /Review>

<text>I went here for years under different ownership and appreciated them.
I knew their current reputation before I went, but my dog was dying at 1:30 am. I had no choice. I had to give her a chance. They took my dog, gave me a CPR release form to sign. The front desk would not let me talk to the doctor before I signed the form. Two minutes later they confirmed that my dog was dead and charged me $1k.
They technically did everything right, but I felt scammed. Their attempts at condolence felt like insult.
Unfortunately, choices of ER Vets in San Francisco are very limited.< /text>< Response>

<name>Emily Risk</name>< review>
I am grateful for the excellent service my sweet kitty boy has received over the years we have been going to AIMSS. He was a real tough guy who made the most out of his nine lives.  I feel the care he received was always appropriate and the providers were consistently kind, super knowledgeable honest and clear (even in the middle of the night). I took him to a primary veterinarian until he was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy after which I only felt comfortable taking him to AIMSS.
One night after getting a clot in his paw  (super painful) I took him in and Dr Williamson diagnosed him in about 2 seconds and gave me the facts about blood clots in cats. He was a lucky one and she saved his life again. The first save was when I brought him in because he was breathing with his mouth open, not normal for cats. I feel la debt of gratitude as we got more quality time with our sweet boy.
Is it expensive? Yes, but that is what emergency care cost. I never felt any procedure was unnecessary or that I was not informed about the cost or that I had no choice.  Dr Black worked getting me set up with an outside pharmacy, and Dr Williamson suggested GoodRx to obtain better prices on medications; both excellent recommendations that made a significant difference in medication expenses.
Do you have to wait? Sometimes...just like the ER for humans. But I found that they do a great job of triaging the animals. So if you have to wait, be patient it just means they are working on saving a life.  In the non emergency times when I had to wait for Cookie to be seen, I was happy to wait because Cookie could wait, he was alive and living a good life, a life he would not be living if it was not for the amazingly qualified and compassionate people at AIMSS. As far as how things went at the end of Cookies stay on the planet... well, true to form the folks at AIMSS handled me, my family and the sweetest cat in the world with the utmost care. That is never easy for anyone. So,  if your furry friend needs emergency care don't hesitate, go to AIMSS.<//review>

Very helpful to read MULTIPLE reviews that coincide with my experience.
As I wait for a broken down bill from AIMSS and SPCA (completely different experience in same scenario) still waits for the Xrays of my now dead dog that AIMSS took and did not send when requested at time of emergency.
I could work on telling my full story or I could just tell you te things that I experienced with them and that I see mentioned again and again in other reviews.
- don’t care about your pet, just the money
-don’t move fast in time of emergency
- no compassion
- no manner from most staff. Some are ok.
- contradictory information
- waiting for a breakdown of my payment
- have not replied emails
I’ll probably come back and update this review accordingly when they get back, if they do.</text>

As others have said, the people in this "hospital" lack compassion and are generally unhelpful unless you're there to give them more money. The doctors themselves seem to be knowledgable enough, and have decent bedside manner for the few minutes they deign to grace you with - but everyone else is *terrible.*

- We are fairly certain that two of the vet techs we saw were stoned. They spoke slowly, gave us contradictory information, and had glazed over eyes.

- The night we went, there was simply no one in the lobby / waiting room... for 30 minutes. We asked if anyone was present (they don't have a bell or anything), but eventually had to call their number to get someone in the back to come forward.

- After the fact, we had questions about the treatment plan & medicine that they gave our 16 week old puppy, so we called to get clarification / express some concerns. We were essentially dismissed by the phone operator, and told to call our primary vet. The fact that we weren't able to talk to anyone in the hospital about the medicines recommended the night of, and then ALSO weren't able to call for clarification - is, frankly, unacceptable.

It's a shame that they are currently the only 24 hour pet care in the city proper (SPCA is no longer 24/7), but even so - I would highly recommend that you drive the extra 10 minutes to BluePearl in Daly City if your pet needs immediate attention.</text>

They cared for my insanely complex Japanese chin who had glaucoma, gme, seizures and heart failure. Dr. Black was an angel to me and my dog. I will forever be grateful for their care, empathy and amazing medical expertise. This is a few years overdue but I had to share.<//text>

We love the care our 2 dogs receive here. The staff are always very friendly and transparent and they understand that we want what is best for our pets without going broke in the process. If you are wondering whether you should take your pet to the emergency vet, or if you are trying to decide between here and somewhere else, just know that I have had nothing but positive experiences here. There's even a dedicated parking lot to the left of the bldg.<//Text>

<review>Cannot recommend.  Grossly overcharged.  No examination, though charged $100.00 for exam just because walked through door. Plus they wanted payment right when I was falling apart due to my beloved family member being euthanized in the next room. And I was incorrectly charged on bill. Within a day the carrier I left with them because the tech asked what I was going to do with it was gone. They do appear concerned and caring on surface, but actions speak louder than than words.  And I had to wait a long time for my pet to be seen, and 5 calls asking about overcharges were not returned though they promised to call back that day. If my animal hadn't been suffering and could have waited a day, I would have been charged $155.00 for what I was incorrectly charged $492.00 for.  The pain was tripled by that and the way I was treated. To me it reeked of practiced ripping off of older, grieving 'parents' of beloved animals.</review>< resp>

<text>the vet tech who came to my assistance when i came in with my nearly expired cat was very rude and showed no signs of compassion.

the assistants who gave me my dead cat in the box i asked for were little better, expressing insincere condolences.

i've had two experiences with this place and both were less-than-stellar.

i'd give a half-star or no-star review if i could.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x8085875dcb39861f:0x8b40d8bbee60ad51<//Gmap_id></record>

Nice front staff and convenient 24 hours clinic with bonus parking lot. However right now I'm not very happy, have a sick dog and vet said ultrasound needed, conveniently a radiologist has already been called. But when estimate given, they charge is for emergency radiologist. Then when questioned they say the radiologist has only been called for our dog. In the meantime I'm sitting on the most uncomfortable bench in the world and the oblivious tech keeps going in and out of the examination room. Not leaving a great impression at this point.<//Text>

This place is great and I am happy they are here. They took wonderful care of my dog. My only problem is that we were told we could pick him up at 10:00 when we called at 7:00am. We double checked as parking is tough and we're told that our dog was still wobbled and they would keep him, call back at noon. NO MENTION OF EXTRA CHARGES. We called at noon and again we're told, we will keep him awhile longer call back at 4:00. AGAIN, NO MENTION OF EXTRA CHARGES! We thought all was good as we had paid $1100.00 the night before. When we finally were able to get our dog as we just went there at 4:30, we were presented with another 500.00 bill. We were home and could have kept an eye on him. This is very poor business practices. I complained 2 weeks ago and was told I would be called back. Today I spoke with Kara and was told I would be called back. Stay tuned.<//text>

<Text>DO NOT BRING YOUR PET HERE!

<user>117970936371684481313</user><user_name>COURTNEY JAMES< /user_name><date>1567786668901<//date><Rate>2</Rate><review>This is an edited version of the letter sent to AIMSS (edit due to character usage not content)
I have always thought that Veterinarians helped animals communicate with their owners. You are the conduit that helps us help our furbabies. You notice all the subtle nuances of an animal and are able to translate those nuances into needs for the owner. Communication and follow up, in any business is paramount, but is essential when you are dealing with the life and health of a living creature. In a lot of ways surgery is the easy part, it’s all the aftercare that takes place at home that is vital for full recovery.
Our experience at your clinic comes with mixed review. While I feel that Dr. Willianson, Dr. Black, and Dr. Neilson are extremely competent and wickedly smart and your clinic is comprised of kind, compassionate staff, I feel that there has been a serious lack of communication and follow up.
On the rare moments you have had the time to speak with me, you’ve explained the boom of business you’ve been experiencing due to the other emergency vets in the Bay Area cutting their hours and how overwhelming it has been for your clinic. I saw this boom as I sat in your waiting room from August 9th - 13th. It is a revolving door. From admission to Discharge (4 days) I saw a vet twice.
When I told a staff member about my experience of only seeing a vet twice during our 4 day stay. Her response at that time was “oh, the standard of care is for the vet to call owners twice a day when a pet is hospitalized.”
In a 3 week time period I have sent 3 emails and made 5 phone calls to the clinic seeking advice for the care of my dog (med questions, activity restrictions, etc).  In total, I have received one return phone call from Dr. Black and zero response to the emails. ***There are several intances where I reached out for help and no one ever followed up, but due to character limit, I am unable to include them***
After my 2 week follow up appointment I was doing some exercises with Bisquit when I noticed  a lot of creaking and popping in her joint. I immediately called the vet to ask if Dr Neilson had made any comment about this in her notes. The receptionist sent me the progress note that Dr Neilson had written.  After I read the progress note, I still had questions, so I responded to the email twice asking for clarification. These emails were never responded to.
I pose these questions, if I was a concerned parent calling in about creaking and popping in a joint of a surgical site, shouldn’t the vet be made aware of that and if that vet was made aware of me calling that day, wouldn’t that vet want to call me to follow up? This is the after care I am referring too. When an animal is admitted to the veterinary hospital for an emergency their care does not stop at discharge.
It is unfortunate that your clinic is experiencing growing pains. It is unfortunate that your clients are not receiving the aftercare that they need and deserve. Follow up care is vital for full recovery. Being there to support us parents so we can support our animals is fundamental to the Vet-Pet-Owner relationship. Will Rogers said…”The best doctor in the world is the veterinarian. He can't ask his patients what is the matter-he's got to just know.” I trusted you to be my dog’s voice. I trusted you to be there to answer my questions so I could support Bisquit to the best of my ability. I needed your help. Your clinic has let down not only me, but most importantly my dog. Please, every day in every second, while you practice, remember the Veterinarian's Oath that you took.
I hope this review will promote some changes in your clinic so other animals and their owners can receive exceptional care that they deserve. Have you ever thought about a Care Coordinator? Someone who is dedicated to solely following up with patients. I know you can’t cap you admissions per day, but surely there has to be a way to provide emergent care while providing the proper follow up and support that each patient needs.<//review>< pictures>

Thank God for this place,  and that they actually have some off street parking!  Haven't always had pleasant experience with reception staff but the vets have been great!  It's a blessing to have 24/7 emergency care available! They're more expensive than a regular vet but they do accept CareCredit which really helps. I was able to get instant approval and they were very helpful with my application process.  Overall nice folks!< /Text>

<Review>This great, women-owned clinic has been my vet for 5 years. Everyone knows our name, and our animals' quirks. Dr Black and Dr Williamson create great relationships with my cats and have been keen to research new, holistic ways to support my rescue Sphynx. I love that they discuss treatment options and never push for things that don't seem absolutely necessary. Nights vets have talked me though simple ways to monitor a sick animal's breathing, and calmed me down over the phone. Techs are sweet and competent, and front desk staff knowledgeable. Super grateful for this clinic! And if you have to wait, it's next to one of the city's best bakeries.<//Review></record>

Incredibly Expensive
My 15 year old dog had a diabetic episode while we were out of town. Our dog sitter brought her to AIM and told them she was diabetic and that she had a seizure.
I spoke by phone to the vet on duty and explained that this had happened before and please do what you can but do not perform any unnecessary procedures such as x-rays.
She was there approximately 8 hours before she had to be euthanized.
The bill was over $4,000, including charges for x-rays. I paid the bill but a few days later requested a detailed explanation of the charges. I sent two follow-up requests but still have not received a response.
My dog had a previous diabetic emergency and we took her to VCA where she had to stay for 48 hours. The bill was approximately the same as it was for 8 hours at AIM. So, beware. If you have time to choose an emergency vet, AIM is outrageously expensive!</Text>

I would not recommend using this veterinarian unless you absolutely must. Communication and bedside manner were all quite poor. Prices are astronomical for overnight stays, and over all experience left me feeling uninformed and without control.< /Text>

<Review>my dog, take a flying leap of a 20 foot wall, luckily he did not break his leg. However when I went in to the vet I sat in a room for 2 hours after paying 700 dollar deposit and all I got was a dog with a bandage on his foot, un empathetic staff and doctor. The doctor came in told me I would need surgery after I refused said that my dog would be fine with a bandage on his foot. I will not recommend them nor will I ever return.<//Review>< name>

<Name>Suzanne Dee< /Name><Review>It is comforting to have this hospital so close by. I have been in need of their services 3 times in my 24 years in San Francisco. Each time they gave my pet compassionate, competent care. The most recent visit was due to our terrier experiencing sudden onset ataxia and vomiting soon after a walk. The doctor immediately suspected that she had ingested marijuana, which was confirmed by urine test. Apparently, it is very common for dogs to be exposed in or near parks. Luckily, she is recovering. I can't thank the staff enough for taking such good care of our dog!</Review>< Date>

Nice facility with friendly staff, provided excellent care for my cat.  I felt they were a bit too eager to get us to agree right off the bat to a broad (and expensive) array of tests instead of starting with the most urgent tests and going from there. Nonetheless I would go back if my cat had another urgent health issue.< /Text>

<review>Took my dog here for a limp leg and leg swelling. They qouted me $3000-4000. It was an emergency since he had a high fever. He had a small knick to his tail at this time and a rash from chewing on it. They wrapped it and mainly treated the leg. The following day i visit my dog, about 3 inches of his tail was wrapped and his leg was supposedly more swollen from the knee tap. They gave me a knew quote that day, adding extra day and services for the knee. I had no choice because my dogs life might have been in danger. I agreed. And was supposed to leave him 3 days now. I called Saturday night to see how he was doing. They said he was recovering but now recommended ANOTHER day. I couldnt afford another thousand+ for another day when my bill was over $5000.... i said ill take him Sunday. They said ok and when i got there, the bill was a few dollars more than what they said in the morning. I asked why it wasnt the $5043 they had originally told me was my total and instead it was $5061 now. At this point, a few dollars mattered.  After waiting 2 hours to get my dog, I noticed his entire tail was wrapped vs the 3 inches from Friday. They only left about 2 inches from the base of his tail.  I didnt think much of it and they said we needed to come back Monday for followup appointment and another bandage change for my dogs tail. They told me my dogs tail was healing every time I talked to them. I didn't go back on Monday because they charge over $55 for just bandage and some other stuff so it would have cost me $100+. On Tuesday, I removed the bandages myself. My dog was crying as i was removing it. I was wondering why he was in so much pain. When o finally got the right bandage off, i saw that the tip of his tail was BLACK, SHRIVELED AND DEAD! Exactly the 3 inches that was covered on that Friday when i went to visit him. I didnt trust them so I never went back to them. I went to SPCA for their opinion and they said his tail needed to be amputated.... now my pitbull does not have a tail and had suffered about a month with a cone around his head...... i wouldn't trust this vet with your pet... all they want is money. I will definitely be pressing charges for them killing me dogs tail... whoever wrappes it was not a professional and wrapped it way too tight BOTH times! Luckily I took it off on Tuesday before the whole tail died.....< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

This place is interesting. Efficient, but horrible bedside manner. I was very tired today and sick so I was slightly out of it but, they should treat the pets owner with more respect. Especially if clients  are dropping a substantial amount of cash on the pet there. Not sure if I will go back for her ultrasound based on my experience.</Text>

Avoid at all cost. The staff at AIMSS is terrible at what they do and even worse at communication. Their catch line is "We're concerned about your pets health we should run some more tests just to be safe."

I had to admit my dog to AIMSS after hours on a Sunday and didn't know what to do but say OK to every procedure. The catheter they had inside my dog slipped out the second day, and they charged me for an x-ray because the vet couldn't remember how long the catheter was and wanted to make sure nothing was left inside.

That being said I had the stitches removed earlier this week and there was one poking out of my dog's skin, and it looked like it swelling up, so I called them last night to ask them if the sutures are dissolvable or not. The guy who picked up the phone told me that he can't help me right now because he has other CLIENTS that need help.---- Let me get one thing straight my pet is not your client my pet is a patient! He might not need attention ASAP, but regardless of the situation, there is a proper way to communicate with worried pet owners.
I asked him if he could give me a time frame so I could give him a callback and he told me he doesn't know when the nurse or the doctor will be free. I politely thanked him and gave him a call 2 hours later asking the same question which is to check his surgery report and tell me if the stitches are dissolvable or not. This time he decided to hang up on me. I'm not going to bother you guys by explaining the # of times I had to call them. Long story short 4.5 hrs later I was able to get the surgery report emailed so that I could go to another Vet and find out if my dog's stitches are dissolvable or not.

They don't care about your pet. They will take advantage of you in your most vulnerable state, misguide you and stop communicating if you're not reaching for a credit card. Their practices are unethical and should really be fined for taking advantage of people.<//Text>

My dog was hit by a car and had run off ( I thought to go die some place) afterwards . I didn't see her for 2 1/2 days and she was returned to me the following Monday. I took her here to make sure she was ok when I got her back it was Memorial Day. They told me it would be $95. To see her , don't get me wrong I love my dog and she is more then just a dog to me, she is my companion and my service animal. But I have no money if it wasn't for the fact I have a very good friend I would be entirely homeless. But I had the insurance info of the woman who had hit my dog and drug her under her vehical for 100 feet and ran her over. Yet this did not make any difference. They did however refer me to the SPCA animal hospital in Filmore and Jackson of which my experience will be posted later.</text>

0 stars!!!

My dog (9 weeks) broke his leg coming down some stairs. I quickly rushed him to the hospital where they were able to see him right away.

We met with Jill Williamson and she was able to locate the fracture pretty quickly.

--This is where things got bad--

She told us that we had to do surgery. We asked for other options and she said we could splint, but no surgeon or doctor would *ever* recommend it. She heavily pushed us towards surgery. (After seeing the final price tag, I understand why)

It cost $3,000 + the $500 to find the fracture.

We felt she pushed us into surgery and that we had to go with that option because she told us to

While the dog was getting surgery, we called around to other vets to get a second opinion. Every other vet said you could pursue either option and they both had their relative strengths and weaknesses.

When we approached her about this, she told us we were being difficult and more or less kicked us out of the hospital....

AFTER GIVING US ANOTHER BILL FOR $800.

Jill Williamson has TERRIBLE bed side manner. Completely rude, more or less yelled at us, said" we were difficult from the moment we walked in" and was completely degrading in our conversation with her. She didn't help us come to terms with the fact our 9 week year old puppy just went through surgery and we we were second guessing the surgery.</Review>

And while it was not the outcome we had hoped for and fought for, we could not have asked for a more peaceful, and supportive transition. I work in human medicine, and have myself unfortunately  transitioned someone else's loved one from critical care to comfort care. The care he received was solid, Dr. Black fought hard for us while keeping us  informed throughout the process. AIMSS also allowed us space and peace even in their very busy treatment area. It was a very painful day but we knew that we did right by our beloved dog. We offered him the best care and a peaceful transition with us by his side. We feel that AIMSS fought as hard as we could with solid science and also empathy all throughout.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<review>The late night female Doctor wanted to hold onto my dog past what was needed and incur me more costs, it felt like a tug of war dealing with her. I brought my pet in a night for toxic poisening and when I called in the AM in hopes I could take him out in the afternoon she insisted I wait until she came back on duty at 7pm, very obnoxious, but they did a good job treating my dog</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x8085875dcb39861f:0x8b40d8bbee60ad51<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Always there when you need them since nothing bad ever happens to your pet when your regular vet is open.  Many serious emergencies can't be handled by your regular vet.  My only complaint is they don't always allow owners in the back.< /Text>

<Review>the car was filthy inside and out and due to covid we had to disinfect the interior as best we can ourselves before we dove off. We had to downgrade because our rental wasn't available but I wasn't expecting the vehicle to be in such unsanitary conditions. I definitely think that is something that should not be overlooked due to covid!< /Review><name>Nedra kennedy</name><userid>100006852391793430658<//userid><rating>1< /rating>< Pics>

Your prices are a little high n because I didn't have time to fill the tank like I thought I would, you charged me $76.00 for gas at $9.99 a gallon-over twice the actual cost! That is a complete RIP off n I expect you to do something about it as a credit or I will start publishing that ridiculous cost in online reviews.<//Text>

<text>There was one employee on staff. Two people were ahead of me, but the employee worked really hard to process every one quickly, so the wait was not long.  When I returned the car, the attendant called me by name as I was getting out of the car and was very friendly and had me checked out in minutes.

<text>Update 2/26/2021:
This rental place have definitely shown improvement since my comment a few weeks ago. When I arrived every week after this incident, staff has been very on top of my reservation when I arrive and let's me know what to expect when I return. Check in has been easy and straight forward. I really appreciate the hard work you all do there! Thank you!!!

This used to be my favorite car rental location out of all the airports in Los Angeles but this place has completely ran down. Checking in there was no organization, customers not wearing masks, and they guy disappeared for over 8 minutes. Checking the rental car back in, no one was there to scan the car, ask questions and greet, or to give me a receipt. I had to go inside and try to ask someone what was going on, to just have the guy just dismiss me and say find it in your email.  Very disorganized.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1611425184171, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear that you are not happy with your rental experience.

Was told they had no SUVs and that I had to wait for one to be cleaned. Waited half an hour and was given a dirty Jeep Compass. Avis' commitment to cleanliness (especially during a global pandemic) is obviously a bunch of BS. I spoke with staff member "Kevin Khou" who simply said "we don't have any other cars" and put in no extra effort to find a resolution to the problem. He told me I could wait longer and he could have the car cleaned "again." The whole ordeal already took 1+ hours and I wasn't about to wait longer. As an Avis Preferred Plus member, I should be able to get in a car and get out within a matter of minutes... but apparently not at this location. Lazy and lackluster customer service. Don't rent from this place.

UPDATE: I emailed them at the address provided (as instructed), and the “email address could not be found.”< /review>< Pics>

< review>
Rental was ok, and the inside counter customer service was pleasant, but the outside customer service, when returning the car, was inadequate. As I stood in the car return area, waiting for assistance, the employees did not greet me or ask if I needed assistance. One employee looked at me, then walked right pass me without a word. I had to stop her from ignoring my presence in order to get rental return instructions. *An important note to Avis... The average customer values customer service when they're spending their money with any company. Investing is customer service professionalism is crucial. Though I may choose not to use Avis again, your future customers deserve more from you.< /review>

Easy check out.   Good choice of vehicles.  Easy Drop off.  Appreciated the ease of the entire transaction.  However at drop off the employee was not wearing a face covering and this made me extremely uncomfortable.  There was no plexiglass shield to create separation between the two of us.</Review>

I originally had a reservation with Hertz for a  trip to Lake Arrowhead and they canceled it last minute. I walked over to the rental office where all the companies were and Kevin at Avis was the only one reprrsentative who greeted me. Kevin and PJ the manager helped me and my family get a small suv for our trip. They saved our trip. I am forever grateful.< /review>

<review>Funny story, I'd ended up at Avis TOTALLY 'by accident', & through a bit of confusion: my 'original deal' was with Enterprise(& after 25 YEARS of being a loyal customer, too?!? gee, THANKS, E/guys! SMH, lol) actually, but they had THOROUGHLY messed me up, JUST 'in time' for the NEW YEARS EVE PARTY= left me with NO car, & at a place CLOSED altogether, 2hr before I had to be AT my family's place for the party, nice, huh!?!

Not only did Avis(at the LB Airport) stepped up & positively RESCUED MY, no OUR ENTIRE holiDAY by finding me a great car, at a pretty good price/deal, too, with *NO RESERVATIONS* (DID I mentinon:*NEW YEARS EVE, & AIRPORT*? LOL), in UNDER 10MINUTES - 5min of which I'd spent explaining what had happened earlier: because of the counter set up, I THOUGHT that Todd was actually part of Enterprise, lol AND Todd was an absolute pleasure to deal with, not to mention listen to: that vioce, WOW!? LOL But then when my only card got canceled from under me, due to some fraudulent activity by an unknown 3rd party, DAY of the return,  & on a SATURDAY evening, too? These guys, & Tood, went way, way, WAY 'out of their way' to accommodate ME, when they would have been well within their rights(& nowdays a LOT of places/people do or would have)to have been absolute harda..butts about it, instead!?! Avis got a new fan in ME. Thanks, guys!< /review>< Pics>

Worst experience ever! Even tried contacting customer service to be told a manager would call me back in 24hrs.  Still waiting for that call and it’s been 2 days.  Did not received car we rented.  Advised Avis ahead of time our flight leaves a little over 24hrs of time of rental.  Employee stated he would make a note in account to not get charged an extra day.  That never happened and he even got the time received car wrong and said we have for 2.5hrs longer then we did.  Horrible horrible horrible!!!!!<//Review>

The service was fast but the car was dirty and had missing buttons on the stereo. It was hard to see out if the windows with incoming traffic because they were dirty. Not worth the price. Also, the gas tank wasn't even full< /Review>

There were two tires that required air several times throughout the 500 mile trip both on the drivers side of the vehicle  We drove across the desert in places without anytype of service available.    There was peanuts and other food particles on the floor.  Trash in the center console.    In theses days with all the Covid precautions a clean vacuumed car should be provided and road worthy    I will never use Avis from Long Beach Airport again</Review>

I waited 1 and a 1/2 hours to get the rental car. There was only one employee at the counter. Remund at the counter was very kind and apologetic,  but this is a company issue and the customers are paying the price. There was a lady who had to attend a funeral and she was so upset she was yelling profanities out of frustration making everyone uncomfortable.  This was not how I wanted to start my short vacation.<//text>

Everything went so smoothly both check in and drop off. No fuzz over anything it makes our day so easy everytime rental with Avis always have 5 stars experience car, service and location of course pricing as well. Highly recommend. We rent suv category originally supposed to be Rav4 but we got 2019 Nissan pathfinder instead it was full size SUV with 700 miles on the dashboard the car itself super nice and clean So much fun to drive.< /review>

<Review>So had went to the LB airport to rent a car from Hertz. They want over $640 for three days hen I get there and no cars are available. I went to two other rental places here at the airport all out of cars then my last chance was AVIS. They hooked me up and for a fantastic price. I was helped at the desk by Todd. He was so kind and so efficient!! He rented me a great SUV for a great price and did it in no time! I was so  impressed with Avis and especially Todd. I will definitely rent my cars from Avis!! I will also tell my friends about the great service and prices at Avis. I’m a happy customer!! Thx Avis. 👍🏽😊<//Review>< pics>

Super clean, low mileage, richly equipped cars, always as expected or even exceeding expectations. The Avis app is nice and logical, with great features, I always use the Avis app before picking up my cars.<//Text>

Rented a Jeep here.  The pick up process for getting he vehicle took less than 10 minutes and I was able to get to my Jeep and drive to the passenger pickup terminal before my wife was able to get our bags from baggage claim.  Excellent experience!  Will use Avis again.<//review>

I prepaid  for my rental and needed to return it two days early and Was told I could not get any money back. You are able to get two additional days of rental from the vehicle I returned, so you will not be losing money only providing very poor customer service< /Review>

<Review>Through out our 60 miles we experienced the car on the freeway having difficulty switching lane and putting out lives in danger. We brought it to the attention when we'd returned and the gentleman treated us as he could care less for our safety.  I called the the customer service and received the same treatment.  Horrible customer Service.  And im in three business of helping people.  No compassion at all.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Exceptional customer service from Jummond. He was so friendly and attentive and the process of renting a car was quick and smooth. Deducting one point since the car interior wasn’t too clean (avis could’ve done a better job wiping the dashboard and the car seats) but the car drove smoothly. Other than the minor issue, I would recommend !</review>

Would I rent from them again? Yes I would! They were so much help and kind! We actually were lined up to get a prepaid car at Budget (do not recommend them at all at least at this location, you can read that review on their site) but Avis help us out in a very tight spot! And we are grateful to have them! We got an upgrade to small suv (Mitsubishi outlander) with my family of four!  No trouble and the guys working the desk that day were great and so was the check in very easy. Sign up to be a preferred member and you get an upgrade. It cost you nothing but about 10 min of your time! Prepay also gives you a discount! First time we have used them and when we go back to lgb airport we will use them again!</review>

Never rent from Avis Car Rental Company at Long Beach Airport!!!! They overcharged me for five entire rent-days because they were unable to locate not only the keys that were dropped in their own designated key drop receptacle, but they were also unable to locate the car which was parked in their own designated return-car parking space!

It was like jumping through fiery hoops to get my money back.  Then, to top it off, they charged me another $22.15 for gas! I filled the tank myself literally minutes before I returned it, and now I am jumping through another set of fiery hoops to get THAT money back.

This amounts to straight up THIEVERY! It’s a pity that Avis is so cash-flow negative that it has to resort to stealing from its customers.  It’s either that or they have the most incompetent employees on the planet.  I have a hard time believing anyone can be that incompetent.

If you like your hard earned money, never rent from Avis Car Rental Company at Long Beach Airport, California. They will attempt steal your money, then when caught, they will make it as if it were an act of Congress to get it back.< /Text>

I made the BIG goof of reserving my car at SNA not LGB, You were short on cars but the person who helped my managed to find me a car at a rate that fit my budget, saving me a trip to SNA to pickup a car. Many thanks.</Review>

Poor customer service, so disappointing. Reserved a  car for the day, two days in advance. Upon arrival, I was told I couldn't give me the car I reserved because their POS couldn't process my VISA card which uses a virtual banking system. My reservation was cancelled and I was told the funds would be credited back to my account within 3-5 business days. I called on the 9th business day and they said I was given incorrect information and that it takes 10 business day and that if I did not receive my funds the following day, I would have to call so they could file a report. It's now been 12 business days and I have not gotten my funds back and, haven't gotten any information from the company. I'm extremely disappointed in the quality of service I have received from this company and do not intend to support this business further. Funny, they can process my card to reserve a car yet, cannot process it to pay for the rental and still have not refunded my reservation charges.<//review>

Love this location! Cross the street and there you are. Very quick from desk to car. Reserved a Chevy Cruz or similar for an excellent price. They were short on cars and would we mind using a Chevy Tahoe.......Uh, no we don't mind that at all. So comfortable. Drop off was also very easy. Will be our go to for car rental whilst in Cali.</review>

The staff were very friendly and helpful.  I was in and out with no issues.  They even upgraded my car at no extra charge.  I was able to return my car with a staff member in the parking lot quickly.  A great place to rent a car right across from the Long Beach Airport.</Review>

BEWARE: Trust me employee scam your rentals agreement to get bonuses for  walk up rates at a discount from your previous registration they will tell you insurance is thrown in I fell for it my reservation was for 150.00 for 2 days and he told me he had a better walk up rate insurance..Didn't sign anything extended car longer total bill for 13 days 1150 added all 3 insurances to the tune of 580 contacted customer service they past me off to billing said they would take 15 percent off I was livid they said they had  a signature that shows on the agreement  aka initials I didn't sign a damn thing because employee said he threw it in with the walk up rate when I left he had enough time to intial to add to my bill ,. Asian man down in Long Beach rental off is the one , because they get bonuses for selling it< /text>

When I arrived I was informed the car I reserved was unavailable and that only a smaller vehicle was available.  The employees were matter-of-fact and unapologetic.  None of the other rental agencies at the airport had the vehicle I had requested from Avis.  Being on vacation with my family I had to take what was available, but I couldn't even get a discounted rate on the vehicle for the trouble.  It seem like when they know you don't have any options they aren't even concerned about doing the right thing and helping the customer out.  The agents at the other agencies were very helpful and tried to located a comparable vehicle at another nearby
branch--that is more than what Avis did.

After contacting Avis Customer service they stated they would refund me $120.05, but they only refunded me $53.  Now I have to contact them again.</review>

Vehicle selection was poor. Was provided a vehicle that was clearly in an accident and was dirty inside with wrappers from candy and other food. Steering wheel was sticky. Front bumper had damage and was marked by Avis, and somehow still released to me as a rental.<//review>

Great staff there - friendly and helpful. When we showed up to pick up our car from Budget and they said "Sorry, we don't have any cars", the folks over at the Avis counter did everything they could to find us a car and get us on our way. You know you're getting AMAZING service when the guy that works the counter goes out and actually CLEANS a car for you so that there's one you can drive away with.<//text>

I've rented several vehicles from this location and have always been pleased!  Their level of customer service is unmatched by any other rental company or facility I've used.  Jummond and the rest of the team have been very pleasant to rent from.  They have a great fleet of cars and keep them well maintained.  I'm looking forward to my upcoming rentals.< /text>

Actually it was Hertz rental car. I picked up from LGB Airport. All rental car agencies are in one location.I reserved a SUV. They didn't have what I reserved. So they offered me a minivan. Wth!!! If I reserve a vehicle 3 or 4 days in advance, you should have what I reserved. You can't floss in a minivan. Maybe a tricked out minivan. But not a regular minivan. Then I was offered a Impala. Ok cool that's better. But I had to pay extra because an Impala was a premium car. What??!!!! Then why did you offer it. I ain't paying extra. I want my SUV. I don't want a minivan. But I'll gladly take that Impala. But I'm not paying extra. I could've argued. But I let it go. Didn't want to seem like an angry large black man. 😉 So, I just settled for the minivan. Hertz you dropped the ball. I should give you one star. But the price was right.😁< /Review>

<Review>Excellent
Rental

I received excellent service from the employee, the return was very easy and quick, The car was a Arcadia; lots of room and the performance was excellent.  I would recommend this car for comfort and ease of driving, when taking a long trip.  Every  other rental car company did not have this vehicle available, or an alternate Mini Van.

Thank You</Review></record></dataset><record>

I just returned from California where I rented an AVIS car at LGB. It's always a great experience; easy arrival, convenient AVIS location, the cars are a few steps away and they are always clean and ready. The return is equally easy in and easy out. And, AVIS employees the best people at the counter and in the lot. Thank you AVIS</Review>

It's a short walk from the terminal to the car rental. No shuttle bus needed.  The car was ready to go,  in great condition, and exactly what I had reserved.  The workers at LGB were very friendly and did not try to con me into paying for extras like I've experienced elsewhere.< /review>

No shuttle bus. I received more car than I expected, which was a pleasent suprise. The car was spotlessly clean. There was no wait to return the car and, again, it was a short walk back to the terminal.

The bad: There are multiple rental car agencies sharing a mobile temporary office, so even as a Avis Preferred member there was a short wait in a line in a very crowded office.

Overall: I would recommend this Avis location.< /text>< Pictures>

My husband took the car for one day. Dropped off the keys later that day. They sent us 4300 dollars bill a month later saying that we never returned that car. We talked on the phone with pretty much everyone over there, but they still keep sending us bills. Completely unprofessional . They need to get their stuff together</review>

<date>1519187691676</date><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>When returning our vehicle we were waved into the parking bay by an Avis staff member who promptly disappeared during the 5 mins it took us to remove our suitcases and clear out the car. We spent 15 mins looking for her to no avail. There were no other Avis staff present. With a flight to catch we had no option but to leave the car keys on the Avis podium but it meant that thru no fault of our own we  could not "sign off" on the vehicle to prove that there was no vehicle damage present when returning the car. Imagine our shock, anger and disappointment to receive a letter from Avis NINE weeks later saying we were being billed $184 for "glass damage"!!!  We certainly do not recall any "glass damage". I have rented from Avis on several occasions in various states and countries but this time will be our last. Our Amex car insurance protection will re-imburse us the $184 so it's actually not about the money - it's about feeling mistreated and being  the brunt of a shady business practice. Goodbye Avis.< /Text>< pics>

I fly into LGB (Long Beach)  from PDX (Portland, OR) 20-25 times a year. EVERY TIME I use Avis. The staff are tremendous and always go out of their way to make sure  I am well taken care of. Being a Preferred Member, the staff always greet me by name and  reflect a true sample of happiness to see me.  I am never just a customer, I am a welcomed friend.
Great cars, newest models. and always a great price. When You rent from a vehicle, at LGB, rent from the best. Avis< /text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>I left expensive personal items and was in a rush to board my plane. Every one I traveled with confirmed those items were in the vehicle prior to returning it.

When I reached out to avis store employees they were no help. 1st they said they'd check the car immediately, but the car had been moved to different location and noone noticed the missing items in the passenger seat as well as the console beneath the AC/Heat guages.

The follow up calls were from personal cell phone numbers and not from registered avis locations. This is shady and completely unprofessional! Do a better job of hiring honest people. As long as I have a choice, I will never rent through avis again.</text><GmapID>0x80dd323b01c6b0c5:0xf65f224fed39eecd</GmapID></record>

<review>You might have to wake the guy up behind the counter.  Also there is no express monitor.  Some cars do not have the transponder no idea to figure out which do.< /review>< Rating>

I had Enterprise reservation. No one was at the counter when I arrived. Shawn offered to match the price. I saved $70 with Avis discount. Thanks to Shawn (
I might spell his name wrong)< /Text>

My family and I made a reservation to get an SUV big enough to accommodate 7 of us. We asked to get a car that could cross the border, as we are going on a small vaca to Ensenada. We booked a suburban and paid for Mexican liability insurance and other fees because we were obviously going to Mexico. Once I arrived to pick up the car at their Long Beach airport location the manager said I couldn't take this vehicle across the border. Since we had booked directly with their 800 line I asked him to call his customer service and confirm our reservation. He refused to call stating he knew his policies. I used my cell phone to call their customer service line and was again assured we were ok to rent and take the car to Baja. The Long Beach manager still refused to speak with their own customer service dept, even while I had them on speaker!!! To make an already long story short, there wasn't one person at Avis in Long Beach that would help me or take a second to double check their policies with their corporate office. It would've been nice of them to take an ounce of interest and attempt to provide good customer service. I was at this place for about 2 hours going back and forth with the manager, Brian Fish and their customer service line. To add insult to injury my phone died so I had to take a taxi back home that cost me $60 not to mention the $29 Uber bill to the airport. DO NOT RENT A CAR FROM AVIS AT THE LONG BEACH AIRPORT. RUDE RUDE RUDE!!!

BTW... ended up getting a minivan at half the price of Avis = )

Really tasty food. Not super spicy but the sauce at the bottom of the dish will get you plenty of heat. Sadly there is no outdoor dining available, so we had to order takeout. They are open for indoor dining though.< /text>

The 3 items I consistently order are toothpick lamb, popcorn chicken cartilage, and the lion fish (sweet and sour).  The french fries presentation of the fish meat is perfect for toddlers. Don't worry about over-ordering because leftovers are still tasty.  For non-spicy eaters, order yogurt to help with the burn.</review>

Highly recommend this place. I know there are a lot of options in thus area, but Chengdu Taste is a gem. The Broil fish spot with green pepper is a total must try! I've never to any place where they use the kinds of peppers and spices they do here.</review>

Spice level manageable and tasty.
Enjoyed the garlic eggplant and spicy beef dishes.
The spicy fish soup had great fish but flavor was lacking. Spice level ok.
Cumin lamb great.
Grilled pork was great too.

Well packed for pick up. Would order again. Would also like to go eat there when it’s safe to do so.<//text>

<text>A nice little eatery. Food is good, but like all places does the price and services worth the food? I say it's the middle of the road. We all strive to look for cheap and good eats. This place may not break your bank but if you're looking for decent and spicy food, then this place will hit some marks for you. Otherwise,  there are similar eats like this one.</text></record>

The place is clean and tidy.  The design of the restaurant is simple but classy.
The owner is honest and friendly businessman.
The dishes basically chilli hot and   tasty as ingredients are fresh.
The services are good and appropriate.
The price is value for money.<//text>

What about the food? Who cares about the food when one is insulted?

And yes, I also speak fluent Mandarin.   I worked in China 7 years ago. This Chinese woman  In the rowland heights store is too arrogant for her job.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

The boiled fish has a lot of bean sprouts as a warning. The building is on the uni boil side. The parking lot is on the busy side but if you are willing to park at the end of the aisle you should be fine.< /Text>

Great place for authentic! Sauteed vegetables are done perfectly. Have the fish with green pepper sauce... it'll change your life.< /review>

<review>Good Szechuan style restaurant and decent food options. There are some non spicy dishes as well even if you don't enjoy spicy food. I prefer Szechuan impression but this place is pretty good too.< /review>< Rating>

<text>I went with my dad and stepmom there today for dinner, since they already ate earlier, so I only ordered 1 dish for myself, the waitress actually made fun of me for that, which made me super uncomfortable :(. After I paid the bill, I was drinking tea and having a conversation with my dad, a different waitress came by rudely interrupted us and telling us "there's other people waiting"...  That was probably the worst experience I ever had from eating out, hope one day they will realize people don't just come here for the food, Services are the key factor. Definitely will not return.< /text><Date>1446274379638</Date>< user>

<text>Went in for food to go. 2 orders. 40 minutes later there was only one order up and a bunch of excuses why the other one would be up later. The original time for completion was 15 minutes. Worst service. Worst excuses. And rude hostess; name xi xi(sp.?) I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. Wouldn't have given it one star but I couldn't post this.<//text><username>donald beau<//username>< response>

If your like authentic Sichuan flavor, this is it. The expert use of hot chili pepper and the use of Sichuan pepper makes the dishes fiery and tasty, just delicious.< /text>

<rating>2<//rating><user>107792938913764496259< /user><review>I got to try out when everyone is hype about this place. I was impressed with menu.  Simple, short  with pics
Why do I give 2 stars.. here why
1. Overall foods are too salty, even the foods  are spicy.
2. Services are bad. They will not check up on you, unless wave with them if they look at your way
3. Table is way too small for those big pots or dishes.
4. I had stried fry a choy veggie since most of dishes doesn't have veggies. We had to sent back because it was too salty. 2nd time is less salty
5. Chicken with green peppers. Mild. . All I could taste is salt n numb herb. Watch put for broken bones in pot.
6. Combo chili pepper. (Intestine,  spam, pig blood, beef tripe, bean sprouts)  Mild. This taste better than green peppers and less salty.< /review>< pictures>

I don't get this place. I don't understand the hype. The flavors were lacking overall. Twice cooked pork is my favorite dish ever but I couldn't really finish my plate here. I felt nauseous afterwards.<//review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Poor service, food and menu do not match, looking for her reaction and said that the picture is for reference only, deceiving customer spending. No squid! The waiter still blames us for not watching! Everyone can take a photo of the Rolling Stone Catfish and see if there are any squid! And the picture is much different! Can not bear to look!

(Original)
差劲的服务，食物与菜单不符，找她反应还说图片只供参考，欺骗客户消费。没有鱿鱼！服务员还怪我们不会看！大家来可以点滚石鱿鱼拍照片看看有没有鱿鱼！和图片更是差别太大！不忍直视！<//Text><Rating>1<//Rating>< pics>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Compared to other American Sichuan restaurants, the authentic Sichuan cuisine has a heavier taste and is closer to the domestic taste.

The dishes of other Sichuan restaurants are neither spicy nor salty.

Takeaway food delivery is very fast and the attitude is also very good, highly recommended!

(Original)
更正宗的川菜，相对其他美国的川菜馆来说，这家店口味比较重，更接近于国内的口味，非常适合年轻人。

别的川菜店的菜吃起来既不辣也不咸.

<rating>2<//rating><Text>(Translated by Google) I used to be a favorite restaurant. I don't know if I changed my chef. I don't know how to do it now. The dishes are not fragrant, not spicy, not numb, no taste, no taste, just eat a mouthful of oil and order a boiled water. Cow, beef marinated with alkali is too smashed, there is no taste of a little meat, bean sprouts have a taste of beans, you end up with no knife-boiled pepper, you put some pepper noodles, you can't add some pepper oil, you can A chicken, the practice should be similar to the mouth chicken, but in the end you sprinkle peanuts, sprinkle a whole peanut, too disappointed!

以前是我最爱的一家饭店，不知是否是换厨师了，现今做的不如以前，菜做的不香，不辣，不麻，没滋没味，就吃一满嘴油，点了个水煮牛，牛肉用碱腌制的太糜烂了，一点肉的口感都没有，豆芽一股豆腥味儿，你最后就是没有刀口椒，你放点花椒面儿，实在不行加点花椒油也行，点了个鸡，做法应该跟口水鸡相似，但是最后你撒点花生碎，撒的是一整把花生上来的，太失望了！< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The taste of the dishes is okay, the stars are pressed wrong, maybe a half star... The service is terrible... The dishes are not cheap, and there are so many people. Is it because of the name? I am very unhappy to serve this sample paper in a country where tips are needed...

菜的味道还可以，星星按错了，可能三星半吧……服务极差……菜不便宜，人还挺多难道就是为了名字来的？我很不开心在一个需要给小费的国家里服务是这个样纸的……</Text>< name>

<user_name>Kevin C<//user_name><date>1506718105726<//date><rating>1</rating><text>(Translated by Google) 1. dining environment 0 point!

No spaces between tables!
That's just about the length of a pencil. Plus Chinese people just like to talk loud in public, I feel like im in a overcrowded schools cafeteria !!!

Rude waiters!
I understand it can be busy, but that's not the reason to be impatient and rude to the customers!

Unclean table and tableware
table was oily and tableware was not very clean, when i ask them to change the tableware, the waiter give me angry look ?! really ?!
dining environment
Very bad
The distance between the tables is very close. You can completely hear the gossip of the next table. In addition, the people in the line are also staring at you for every move, and our Chinese people like to speak loudly in public, no matter if there is no one next to them. The whole meal process is just two words! Uncomfortable!

Waiter has a bad attitude
Although I understand that you are very busy, oh, so you can ignore the guests love? Then look impatiently? I paid to eat to see my face?

The dishes are not washed
Once I saw a ghost on the tableware, like a small piece of oil, right? Forget it anyway, such things are common in Chinese restaurants, but when I politely asked the waiter to change it, the goods gave me an uncomfortable look and went back without saying anything. . . Really speechless

2. food
to be fair, the food at this place was actually pretty good.
only a little bit too salt for me.
It's fair to say that although the service is terrible, the food is good. There are just a few dishes that are really salty ... I'm very heavy-mouthed and I feel salty ...

3. Value for money
fair price, for the tasty food.
The price is cheap, and it is worth the taste of the food.

用餐环境
非常糟糕
桌子间距离很近 你可以完全听到隔壁桌说的八卦。另外排队的人也在旁边盯着你吃饭一举一动，加上我们国人就是喜欢在公共场合大声说话，根本不管旁边又没人。整个用餐过程就两个字！ 难受！

服务员态度不好
虽然理解你们是很忙，哦，所以你们就可以对客人爱答不理？然后不耐烦的给人脸色看？我花钱吃饭是来看脸色的咯？

餐具没有洗干净
有一次看见餐具上沾了个不知道什么鬼东西 像是一小块油迹吧？ 算了 反正中餐馆这种事情也是常有， 但是当我客气的要求服务员换一下的时候，这货给我一个不爽的眼神 话也不说就拿着东西回去。。。实在很无语

2. food

公平的说 虽然服务糟糕透顶 但是食物还是不错的. 只是有几个菜真的真的很咸....我算是很重口的 吃着都觉得咸了...

点了一个牛肉什么的菜，可是我母亲觉得有点咸。随口和服务员说了一下，结果店方直接重新换了一份。服务非常周到。</Text>< pictures>

<rating>1</rating><Text>(Translated by Google) The food is not even that good, and plus worst service ever. The server here is rude, stereotypical, and very judgmental. I went to eat with my sister today, we were being ignored because of our appearances. When I first sat down I ordered BoBo Chicken (one of my favorite), and after like 5 minuets I put in three more orders. When the rest of my order came out the BoBo Chicken was still not out. Then I asked one of the server, who seems to be the food handler, he said I didn't put in that order. I was like “Okay? I put in that order the moment I came in” I mean that's the only reason I went there for. Then we asked for water, and the server looked very irritated and annoyed, and that's like the first request we ever made since we came in. How irritating can we be? From start to finish no one came to our table asking how we were doing, if we needed anything, blah blah blah. The only person that came by was the one who handled our food, and when we raised our hand to ask for wa ter. When we were ready for the check and some box for the left over food, the server just brought some containers and bags to have us box it up ourselves. This is just straight up rude.
They think we look like some middle / high schooler who could n’t afford to eat or give good tips. Well with the type of service and attitude they provide, I ’m doubtful they will get any good tips.
The service here is terrible! The waiter's attitude was very bad. An attitude of being impatient and bored when talking to guests. I went to dinner with my sister and ordered the bowl chicken first. After looking at the menu, I ordered three other dishes. It stands to reason that the bowl chicken should be the first one, but the other three dishes have all come up and the bowl chicken has not been served. Later, I asked the barman who served me, he said we didn't order. I said it was impossible for me to order as soon as I came in, and he ordered a copy for me. No one came from ordering to eating to ask how we were eating or what we needed. Even packing made us pack our own, and gave us a box and a bag. It takes half a day for the bill to come over and collect the bill. I think they are a bit dog-eyed, and I think my sister and I are two little fart kids who have no money to eat, let alone give a tip. It's strange to have tips like their service attitude.

这里的服务太糟糕了！服务员态度非常恶劣，一副爱吃不吃的态度。 跟客人讲话就一脸的不耐烦、厌烦的一种态度。我跟我妹去吃饭，先点了钵钵鸡。后来看完菜单又点了其他三道菜。按理说钵钵鸡应该是第一个上的，可是其他三道菜都上来了钵钵鸡还没上。后来我问了那个给我上菜的男服务员，他说我们没有点。我说不可能我一进来就点了，然后他就帮我点了一份。 从点完菜到吃完都没有一个人过来问我们吃的怎么样了，或者是需要些什么。就连打包都让我们自己打包，给了我们一下盒子和袋子。买单还要等半天才过来取账单。我觉得他们有点狗眼看人低的样子，觉得我跟我妹就是两个小屁孩儿根本没钱吃饭更别说给好小费了。 像他们这种服务态度有小费才怪呢。</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
The service is always horrible. The girls that work here will walk past you 5xs when you’re clearly standing next to the fitting room with clothes in hand to try on. I’ve brought my daughter in a few times for back to school shopping in the last month and not one person has asked if we needed help finding anything, not even a hello when you walk in. They’re all extremely cold and unfriendly. This is the last time I come in, I’m so tired of having to break up the conversation to ask for a fitting room and then get a dumb stare in return and wait another 5 minutes for them to walk over and rudely open the door.</Review>

Absolutely adorable friendly spot, our usual local hang out. I LOVE that the crosswalks on all 4 corners around it is now rainbow colored. Hell yeah! More color is much better 🌈.
I am so proud of Long Beach! They think Hollywood, West Hollywood is pofressive, but let me tell you, they got nothing on our LBC, cause we are Hollywood by the sea! Huge progressive crowds here, youthful, inclusive, LGBTQ friendly and supportive, multicultural, fun, sweet, people oriented. Pride 🌈 is huuuuge here, parade goes for miles, and much less % of narrow minded souls.
And this spot, is a staple in the LBC. I am not gay, but I have been here many times, and always had a blast, I love the ppl of Long Beach 👉 they love to have fun and are very engaging and friendly. Come down to here one time, and you will know what I mean.
Engaging staff, great prices, party crowds going for days. Not a dull moment, even when empty, just a great vibe!!!< /Text>

<Review>Mostly  female,  but all kinds of people overall.  One  person bought several pizzas for the  entire bar to share.  I don't know if that happens a lot,  but it was very cool!
Nice vibe, neighborhood  bar, mostly  woman-oriented, but open & accepting of all. The demographics  changed at least a couple of  times  in the times I was there, in terms of age, gender, race etc. If I lived nearby, I'd probably  come here often.</Review><response>None<//response><pics>None< /pics>< Gmap_id>

Decent bar. Chill place. Not too crowded. They have pool tables and a jukebox to play modern tunes. Nothing special.< /review>

Cozy, super LGBT friendly. Bartender was so helpful and made you feel like you are at a home local bar. Great music! The volume of the music was perfect for talking and no need to scream at each other.<//Text>

Terry the bartender is amazing hes always super attentive unless of course it's a busy night it'll take a while to get a drink but usually their stiff/cheap drinks are worth the wait. Well drinks are like 3 dollhairs on Wednesdays (normally $5 other days) if you like to shoot pool there's also free pool on wed. Music is customer selected via a modern jukebox thing only downside to that is some people have weird taste in music but pretty decent crowd most of the time. The restrooms do smell kinda funky  there so I just always hold my breath when I go but other than that sweet water is a pretty good time.</text>

This place can range from quite to a bit noisy. Mostly a locals kinda place with pool tables. Plenty of different alcohols to choose from and a decent bottled beer selections with a few beers on tap. The bartenders are nice and friendly and for you gals there is a restroom for you too just ask the bartender for the key. The men's restroom is not private lol.<//text>

<Review>Very friendly bar staff. The woman who helped me was super nice when I didn't realize that they were cash only, and had to run home and pay her in quarters! Another bartender took the time to chat with us for a few minutes. Good dive bar.< /Review><time>1478626952919</time>< Rating>

I live close I'll be frequenting this establishment.  Nice crowd, varied crowd.  LGTB friendly, but I have noticed lots of groups of younger kids (20s) come here pretty often.  Come on down!< /Review>< Pictures>

Love this place for what it is but the only thing is that they have like 10 oz beer mugs for draft.😕 Idk if thats a happy hr thing or if its their standard. With that being said id say its probably better ordering a mixed drink. Other than that, great place!</review>

<Review>Wow talk about an unfriendly place. It took forever to get a drink from the bartender. So after 10 minutes Andy went and asked her to come serve me. I then still wait as she checks on everyone and then opens me a Budweiser and ask for 3 dollars. I did not ask for a bud. I wasn't even asked what i wanted. I guess i look like a bud man. I said i am sorry i did not want a Budweiser. I then  order a Corona bud light and vodka drink for my friends. I guess the total is 12. I get 8 dollars back a smerk and thank you. I can totally understand why the bar is so empty. I know i will never return. Bartenders should learn you are working cause you bring in customers. If you bave no customers no reason to have bartenders. If you are looking for an afternoon drink on a Wednesday i would say go somewhere else. Lots of choices.</Review><Name>Ron Littlejohn<//Name><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

I had a terrible experience at Sweetwater . The bartender, Stephen,  couldn't get our drink orders right and  after the third correction he threw my change at my face.  This bar was a decent spot before they hired a tired, angry and deeply bitter man. This place gets one star because, after all,  they serve alcohol.<//Text>

< review>
We walk by here and my kids always insist on stopping in.  Sure enough the kid in everyone comes out when you step foot into this place.  Everyone opens up, folks smile at each other, there is conversation as we all dabble in the puzzles and quirky toys.  The staff is always so friendly and informative.  I've bought some great souvenirs for friends and toys for kids.  Stop in..even if you don't buy anything...leave that boring sidewalk where no one acknowledges each other and meet the warm hearts of your community in this toy shop!<//review>

<review>LOTS of toys, games, gidgets and gadgets. Fun to check out even if you don't intend to buy anything. Plenty of gift options and they have board games. We checked it out during a stroll one day and decided to purchase Scrabble. Great service too!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Awesome toys! Real toys! I love this sweet little gem of a store. Something for every child and prices are fair. The woman who was there was so kind and helpful. She really loves what she does. Thanks sis, for showing me this great place.<//Review>

<review>This place is great for unique gift ideas! The owner is very nice, outgoing and informative.  If you a tired of cheap plastic disposable toys for kids then this is the place to be. They also have fun gifts for adults. I have my eye on one their giant wind chimes that make the most beautiful sound.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Such a wonderful place.  Being in the store brought back memories of the toys that I actually appreciated. Toys that last forever make you think when you use them. It's a great place to go shopping for your child,  for niece or nephew, baby shower, as well as for yourself.</review>

I have ordered from them 3 times, all months apart from each other. The employees do not know what they are doing. They are unwilling to help and blatantly ignore customers. One of them was counting the money for 15 minutes and when someone finally got her attention, she said she was clocking out and someone else can help him. A good number of them were also not wearing their masks up to their nose. Overall, the staff in this location are very unprofessional and do not know anything that they are doing.</text>< time>

I love wingstop. They have they good and bad days and what I mean about that is sometimes wing be so prefect make you wanna go back for more and then other times it be overcooked, dry, no sauce. But being I went 1hr before they closed it's pretty good. I got lemon pepper all flats< /Review>

< Review>
It was so busy last night and I had a big order that kept me waiting even longer for my food ( 50 piece and 2 sides). All that waiting and they forgot my side orders! Too late to call , I called this morning and to my surprise Alex took care of my missing side orders. I am amazed at how he handled my situation- because i also understand i have no "actual" proof that this, but who calls for a missing $8 for 10 wings who really got them?  Anyways, I'm glad the manger handled the situation at hand the way he did and for this I will remain a wing stop customer. Thank you for making this right Alex,, I was sadly prepared to be ripped off - but you made sure that was not the case. I hope you ended up having a better day than me!< /Review>

<text>Great this place closes at midnight, but not munchie friendly since their dine in lobby gets shut down before 11. Would of been well worth hitting up the AC. For a comfortable dine in experience.< /text>< pictures>

<text>Horrible Service at this Wing Stop! I'm all for kids having jobs but they have to care . I placed an online order that stated extra well fries with extra fry seasoning and this is what was given to me(See Photo). I then called up to the restaurant after I placed the online order to specifically ask for extra crispy fries. I actually felt it was done intentionally. The Women states fries are only cooked for a minute and a half which doesn't make sense if there is an extra well done option.
I should no better because the last time I was at this Wing Stop  FF Police Department had to enter the Restaurant with weapons drawn to pull out a group of kids (who happen to be related to a couple of the workers) accused of theft/ robbery.</text><Date>1568869776899<//Date><gmapID>0x80851423dd18fab5:0x231b5aaabf01cd1<//gmapID><name>Anthony Williams< /name>< resp>

<Review>Bad service. Was helped by Erika, I said hello, she says nothing  looks at me with a blank stare. I tell her my order, only thing she said was "thats it" after tell her my order. I look at her in the eye and say "thank you, have a good day" she looks at me for 2 seconds IN THE EYES and just turn around and walked away. It was a very rude and uninviting experience and won't be coming here with my co workers for lunch again. If you are working customer service, you need to at least greet your customer or find another job because she looked like she didn't want to be there.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFaLUCMD69eJlA9j5EHnZkfSPTdFS1VCcTW2wT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

<review>I'll admit I was a little skeptical about wait times due to some of the reviews, especially since my family was looking for a quick pit stop off I80. I made an online order about 15 minutes away on a Thursday night, and the website said the order would take 18-23 minutes. After showing up to the restaurant, where 3 groups were already eating, we quickly paid, and the cashier said it would be just a few minutes. We went to the bathroom, got our drinks, and got our food a little over 5 minutes after arriving. Very reasonable! The cashier also offered us some extra sauce. The wings were hot and delicious! Overall quick, pleasant experience, and the employees were very nice.<//review><user>106567896136167478038< /user><username>Jenna Fontaine< /username><Pictures>None</Pictures><GmapID>0x80851423dd18fab5:0x231b5aaabf01cd1<//GmapID></record>

<Text>Had a little birthday celebration dinner here with friends over the years. The place is decently maintained and the staff are super friendly and even sang a surprise happy birthday for my friend! The chicken was not too salty or dry, and the vegetable sticks tasted fresh and sweet! Love going there for the spicy sauces.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>I came on here to update my review since businesses can improve over time. A few months back I wrote a one star rating for absolutely terrible service. Where is my review Google? I will re-iterate my experience. I ordered an hour an advance, I walked in, and I stood in line with everyone else. They completely ignored me, helped others, and people who ordered their food after I came in were served their food. For me, they just told me it's not ready. When it was ready, why did they not let me know when they let other customers know? Why was I not served like everyone else? Did I smell?  My wife, waiting in the car, was furious. I actually wrote my review while waiting in the store. Is this an experience people don't deserve to know? Look at other reviews, they also mention the horrible speed. Google, don't you ever suppress my attempt at enlightening my locals again. I will keep a record of "this" one at the least.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>The wings are cooked when ordered, so everything is hot. If getting the lemon pepper ask for a extra bag because that butter bath tastes good it'll come through the bag after leaving.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Whenever I come to this particular WingStop location the customer service is always good, they update you on your order if it takes a long time, and they ALWAYS get my order CORRECT which I absolutely love. That is one of the most important things I look for in any restaurant establishment. Do they CONSISTENTLY get my order correct? And the answer to that for this WingStop location is YES! The employees in the kitchen area always look organized, communicate well, and know what they're doing. Well done WingStop Fairfield team. Keep up the good work.</Text>

Funny thing is I go here more often than I'd like to admit.

Recently my Wife ordered online and as usual we received a message saying the food was ready.  Once I arrived at the Wing Stop as usual the food wasn't really ready.

Typically they just tell me that it'll be another 10 minutes and I pay but this time it wasn't just another 10 minutes.  Instead, I found myself waiting for about an hour.

I'm a patient man and I was already out to pick up the food so I didn't really feel like heading somewhere else at 10 at night.

After seeing me wait for some time a guy, one of the employees, comes up to me and asks if I'm waiting on something and I replied with the name on the order.  After reviewing what happened he went back and realized my order wasn't made or close to being made yet.

After figuring out that my order wasn't ready he apologized more than he ever needed to and asked me if there was anything else I'd like.  I asked for maybe another thing of bleu cheese and that was it.  He happily obliged and after about 15 additional minutes all was supposedly right with the world.

Finally I get home and begin unpacking the all the wings n such and once I open the package containing my order I realized they forgot to put the original hot sauce on the wings.

Regardless, I still ate the wings as I was hungry and didn't feel like addressing the problem immediately.

Not sure what's going on lately but it's just been one fumbled order after the other. Usually missing veggie sticks or fries but  I think I'm simply going to just hold off on Wing Stop until either the staff becomes properly trained, quit or fired.  I hate to say it that way but that's just the way it is.

Overall!!!

Usually love the wings amongst everything else on the menu.

The staff could use a chin up because they're typically borderline rude but I look past it.

The staff could use some development with their abilities to multitask, take food orders and overall customer service.  Oh and double check their finished orders for accuracy.

Other than that, I probably won't be dropping by any time relatively soon.  I'll give it a good 6 months or so to see if anything has changed.<//text>

Went last night and was charged almost $20 for a large meal. 10pc (asked for wings only, 2 times and got mixed with only 3 wings), veggie sticks and drink for $17.42 and wasn't asked for a dipping sauce. Went back in to get sauce and charged an additional $1.29. Absolutely unacceptable!!!< /Text>

Ordered a 6 piece boneless wing and whoever is working decided to pick the tiniest little crumbs and counted them as wings. One didn’t even have meat in it and 3 were the size of a gum ball. How worthless do you have to be for this bs.< /Review>

I got parmesan garlic wings and they were incredibly dry. I don't know what they used for the flavor but it was horrible. They don't compare at all to the parmesan garlic wings at Buffalo Wild Wings.<//Review>

It's OK, if you don't mind waiting.  WAY too slow. They can't handle a rush. They really need to learn better customer service as well. Employees at register are always apologizing for slow service. Call in ahead, then add 30 minutes to whatever time they say your order will be ready. Superbowl Sunday? Forget it if you want to eat.<//text>

<Name>Gabrielle La Compte</Name><text>This is one of the slowest joints ever.  Which is super surprising considering all they'd doing to deepfrying some chicken wings and tossing them in sauce.  I've worked in the food industry for 10 years and NEVER have I worked anywhere so slow and they STILL manage to get your order wrong.  Given, I ordered online this time too because last time, I kid you not I waited in line for an HOUR.  I'm gonna point fingers at poor management because generally, they'd be on your tail for such work.  When I went in today, the girl at the register was actively arguing with another off duty employee, she kept apologizing to me for it but would just go back to arguing with her and once the girl off duty left, she continued to talk about it with another lady she worked with.  All the while, letting her annoyance out on me.  I don't care about your petty workplace drama but these ladies need to figure out how to be professional.  I will do longer be doing business with wing stop.  Guys, Buffalo Wild Wings is right around the corner, I recommend going on over to them if you want your food made right and people who know how to be professional.<//text>< Rating>

Beyond horrible customer service We got there after are order was supposed to be ready we ended up waiting for over 30 more mins then watched as person after person was givin there fresh cooked food everyone elses names were called for 25 mins next time the employees shouldn’t be chatting it up about how long they have been in a relationship and check to make sure there customers get there food and are completely satisfied< /review>

Service is great, and though food takes about 10 minutes, food is still very tasty and waiting 10 minutes isn't bad.</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Yesterday I went to eat here, I wait 15 to 20 minutes which is normal as long as my food is fresh, I am not going to make any comments online about how bad oh well it is a fast food restaurant because 15 years of my life have worked in them but, that they get to the point where I give them back the food because it was super cold and old .. they reheated the 5 lemon and pepper and the atomic including my parents .. I no longer told them anything I ate them and left there .. unfortunately there no longer return I made me super nasty .. I hope and when they return the food they make it fresh, they do not overheat it because people like me who have worked in the environment, know how to differentiate between fresh chickens and us chickens overheated ..

(Original)
Ayer fui a comer aqui, espero 15 a 20 minutos lo que es normal siempre y cuando mi comida estuviera fresca, no soy de hacer ningun comentario online sobre lo malo oh bueno que es un restaursnte de comida rápida por que 15 años de mi vida trabaje en ellos pero, que lleguen al punto al cual yo les devuelvo la comida por que estaba super fria y vieja.. me recalentaron los 5 lemon and pepper y los atomic incluyendo mis papás.. ya no les dije nada me los comi y sali de ahi.. lamentablemente ahi ya no regreso yo se me hizo super nasty.. espero y cuando les regresen la comida la hagan frezca no la recalienten por que personas como yo que han trabajado en el ambiente, sabe diferenciar entre unos pollos frescos y nos pollos recalentados..</review>< Pictures>

Very nice people. Offering is American comfort food like corndogs, burgers, etc. Everything feels like it's from a can or store-bought and cooked, which you know you like if you're reading this. Promotes Trump-is-still-my-president conspiracy, so if you're uncomfortable with that stay away, and if you like that, then visit. No masks anywhere.<//Text>

Stopped after fishing at Davis Lake. Have eaten here many times.. We ordered a couple of burgers, fries and shakes. Nice people, friendly service and great burgers. If you're passing through make sure you stop for a cone, shake or burger. 🍔🙂</Text>

Looked around town and decided this was a good place to est.

I had a chicago dog and She had a shrimp basket.  We both had Rootbeer floats made with soft serve..

Not super cheap but not unreasonable
the food was very good and of  plenty of quantity.

We will stop there again.< /text>

Great little place to stop and cool off but don’t bring a large crowd as they couldn’t handle the order. Other then that the treats were yummy.< /Review>

I went to Portola Frosty last summer and got a really good burger it was the pa burger. The next time I went I ordered the same thing and got something different.  And it wasn’t good. So I didn’t go back. I went there the other day and ordered the pa  burger. Again it was really good. I went back today and got something different once again it was terrible flavorless and just awful so I took it back. I gave them $12 I got $10.75 back. So chances are I will not be back if you can only get good food half the time. If I wanted to eat food that was not good I would go to the Greyeagle frosty.< /Text>

I spent almost 5 years of my life in this town as a kid growing up and had to move in back down to so-cal when my grandpa died. It's been 23years but I finally got to go back and visit. I didn't realize how much I missed the place.</Review>

Roadside grill with great selection of classic burgers/hotdog/fries and shakes. Everything is made to order, so it can take some time. There are picnic tables in the grass area adjacent to the parking, but be warned - No Dogs allowed in the picnic area.< /Review>

Good stuff. You know, for a typical frosty burger, this is the best.  Good foods, right on the road so easy in n out. Also, just as an interest thing, there's a cute little wood carved bears and such place right in the parking lot.< /Text>

We stoped in to get an Sunday ice cream 🍦 on our way outta town. This place has the best ice cream in town!! It was really busy for a Sunday too, and a little slow because they make everything fresh so it takes a little longer.<//Text>

Their food is just ok + burgers would be a lot better if they used fresh 80/20 ground beef instead of frozen patties - ditto on the fries - cut fresh from fresh potatoes instead of using frozen fries,  BUT they have the ABSOLUTE BEST SOFT SERVE ICE CREAM AND MILK SHAKES!!!!</text>

Friendly service and a convenient spot to stop when coming off the mountain. Typical drive in fare, but reasonably priced, good portions, and hits the spot. My kids didn't complain. Picnic tables in shaded areas to eat.</Review>

<Text>Very sad, sign said closed at 7pm. Closed its doors at 6:40 won't serve Anybody food, because  They're TIRED. The older lady said to go back to Reno and eat at McDonald's and slammed their glass window on me. We will not be back! We use to come every year. The kids looked forward to milkshakes and Burgers

Good fresh lemonade, good fries. But overpriced for stadium food. Service was a little rude and off putting. Overall food is dank but service is rank.< /review>

<text>Styrofoam and plastic straws galore. That being said, the structure and theme ring a nostalgic note. I had grilled cheese, curly fries and a mint chocolate shake. Our group was seeking this out after a wonderful hike. Grilled cheese was fine. Basic cheese and stuff but grilled well with the bread. Curly fries were seasoned and definitely from the bag. Again, nostalgia. Shake had some real chocolate bits but the density was disappointing. Overall, I probably won't come back there. lso, something my friends caught. There was an older woman with blonde hair that came out of the back and seemed to be berating the younger girls inside. Again, this was the friends that were in better view than I. Let's get away from styrofoam and single use straws but keep the nostalgia.<//text><user_id>112755739404018647242< /user_id><Time>1531702604810< /Time><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmapID>0x809c145d7a5dfe21:0xf378f5ebc1b298d0<//gmapID>< resp>

I came back to return my burger. I told them these burgers are raw and I can't eat raw meat and she said you don't have to be rude. If you do go here it will cost you over $20 for two people to eat two burgers and one small fry without drinks. Make sure to order whatever it is well done or you will get a raw Burger!</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
UPDATED: The owner of the Portola Frosty contacted me. She was very apologetic, and explained what had happened was while she was out of town, another person had bought supplies for the restaurant, and purchased a different product.

Because they were working with a different product than usual, they did not realize the cook time was to be so different.

They have since replaced their stock with the usual product and measures have been taken to ensure the purchase of the right product in the future.

She told me that she would be going over some more training with the employees, to make sure they respond appropriately to situations in the future.

She also offered to buy My partner and I dinner at the Log Cabin when they open.

The environmental health department did do an inspection and helped put me in touch with the owner.
The Frosty passed the inspection fine, and the environmental health department assured me they believe the Portola Frosty is not in the habit of serving raw food to people, that this was a one time oversight. (After discovering the source of the issue, I agree)

I feel the environmental health department and the owner did respond appropriately to the situation overall, and hope the kiddo will learn to have better pride in her customer service skills in the future.

Original post:

My first choice was not to put this on social media, but my lack of ability to get ahold of anyone to talk to has changed my mind about writing this review.

I should not have to work so hard to talk to someone who will handle this with an appropriate amount of care.

This weekend the Portola Frosty served me RAW CHICKEN, very raw. It was burned on the outside and raw like sushi on the inside.

I ordered to go, and noticed when I got home. I really just wanted to call them and let them know. However, they would not answer the phone (they would pick it up and then hang up immediately), and there was no answering machine picking up for them, so I decided to go back to the Frosty and tell them. Being concerned they may serve others undercooked food also.

When I approached the window with my bag of raw chicken, the kiddo that came to help me, only said “I am sorry, I understand...” And kept repeating “I understand” whenever I finished a sentence. She was not rude to me, and I was not rude to her.

If I was complaining about getting tomatoes when we didn’t order them or the wrong flavor of ice cream, I could understand her shutting me down rather than addressing my complaint (still bad customer service but she’s a kid, hopefully she will learn better eventually).

RAW CHICKEN is something that should get much more of a response than “I understand”. It is a hazard, and is potentially very dangerous.

She did not attempt to take my name, she did not promise me that it would never happen again, she did not offer to get her supervisor, or look at the chicken, she didn’t even offer me a refund.

Her lack of concern about the situation leaves me to believe that this will not be addressed, leaving potential for this to happen to others.

Please use caution when consuming food from this establishment, they do not take the best care with safe food handling, and their customer service lacking genuine concern for a minimum quality of product control.

The food is always awesome, price is right, but the wait time is ridiculous. I ordered 1 burger in the drive thru 35 minutes ago and I'm still waiting for it after watching an employee show up, walk in, get a burger and leave, and 2 drive thru customers that came after me get their food.</text>

Highly recommend, for my is the best Pizza in San Diego, we just try the cheese pizza, thanks to my kids, but is really good !

This is also a brewery in San Diego and they have a very good beer, the one that I love is Shark Bite brown ale!! Awesome!

The staff were really friendly!!

<Text>The food was fabulous here. The pizza tasted grest, the beer was fresh, the pretzels were huge and the side salads were very large. The staff was extremely friendly and the business was very clean and spaced everyone apart from each other. We absolutely loved this place and will visit it when we return to California!<//Text>< pictures>

I give the food five stars but the lame service gets three.
The blonde has now kept me waiting for my food twice. I order, hang out and enjoy a beverage and they are to call me when food is ready to go...nope, not her. She never even checked. Had to get some of the food redone since it sat so long..</Review>

Excellent beer selection, whether you prefer a lighter beer,  IPA’s or stouts they’ll have it here. My wife and I ordered a pepperoni pizza with an imperial stout and coffee Porter. Pizza was decent but I would come back for the beer and outstanding service. Great brewery and really close to Ocean bean which is another plus.<//review>

Amazing pizza and beer! Good COVID safety. Love that they turned the parking lot into outdoor seating. We always travel with a dog and it's been hard to find seating outside in the past.</text>

<Text>This place was recommended by a friend who used to live in the area. It truly was a "religious experience"! This place ranks up in the top 3 pizza joints I've ever been to in the world. Their beer is also fantastic. Prices are incredibly reasonable; I got 2 small deluxe pizzas, a pint, 2 sodas, a salad, and a pint of house made ice cream for 45 bucks. Can't beat that!<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcrwma208EeupPEpSbC6U2xAvN7JWQ_uwQKnl-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_KjM1ZMTze5uHrccETrQMjqo1ZWZ1uyc2DcrG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

It’s a family-owned restaurant, with friendly service and homestyle cooking, Their pizzas are quite popular at dinner, but In my opinion, they outshine at breakfast. Also, the waiters are very helpful and attentive. The prices are very reasonable too. We will come back and recommend to all of my relatives!< /Text>

The food is always made fresh. I've never had a bad meal here. They keep the most amazing beers on tap. A great atmosphere to bring your family or watch the game. The service is proper. What else do you need?</Text>

<Review>We went on a Thursday night in April 2021 at 7:30pm and it was over an hour to receive a pizza. We waited in a line for 15 minutes just to get to the “place order here” sign. This line was sort of socially distanced but not really bc the line went out the door and ppl were crowding inside to not be out in the cold.

The place WAS PACKED with customers. It looked pre-pandemic in here. If you’re not scared of Covid, this is the place for you.<//Review>< Resp>

Excellent pizza! Restaurant was partially full. When we ordered, the cashier was very friendly and very attentive to our indecision about what to order. Very Helpful. The food was very good, fresh and hot and we got our food quickly. Thank you guys for the outstanding service!< /Text>

The food was okay. Pizza was very soppy and soggy, but not in a bad way. Just not my style. There’s a LOT of cheese. The specials are cool and there’s a great beer selection (that I unfortunately didn’t get to try). Very cool atmosphere and decor, somehow very flexible and good for both families and friends/bar hopping. I’d come back but maybe get a different meal haha. The salad was great, pizza not my style.</Review>

<Name>Ashleigh MacDonald< /Name><Review>Wow. This is an awesome brewery pizza joint. It is so busy. Lots of craft beer options. Many pizza options too. Extra tasty pizza with lots of toppings. Many seating option, including high tables, picnic tables and outdoor bars. Cool but busy atmosphere. Child friendly at early hours. Quite loud in the late evenings as everyone is having fun. Wheelchair friendly yet only seating at ends of tables available.< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< user>

Awesome place I love it here. Even though it's always hard to find a parking spot.  Great staff, customer service and excellent pizzas. So many choices of pizza and beer.  My favorite imperial stout Santa Little Helper with the Simpson on my mind. Nice chilled environment great to hang with friends too. Mini arcade there as well and clean bathroom.  Come for a sunset and swing in here.</text>

Beer selection is great. Pizza is ok, kinda doughy for my taste, I prefer a crispier crust so I’d order a pizza well done next time. They have outside seating for you to drink a beer while you wait for your togo order.</review>

<text>The beer is some of the best in San Diego, which is a high compliment in this beer town. The pizza is also really good. There are a lot of pizzas, including several veggie options. You can also get it normal or thin crust style. The service is friendly. It's counter service, not table service, which feels especially good in these covid times. They are also doing a good job with safety protocols, keeping people distant, limiting the number of people, etc. That means you might have a wait during busy times, but well worth the wait!< /text>< pics>

I was finally around the area and had a chance to try pizza port in Ocean Beach. We called ahead to avoid the crowd and the wait for the food. Got the all meet and the Roma, both were delicious. The service was good although they get real busy so expect to wait and may be ignored. They currently have all dining in the patio and in their parking lot.  So parking in the area is a little tough and you're probably going to need to look for street parking. Overall the food was very good.<//Review>

Excellent Pizza Port Ocean Beach with interesting combos.  Fresh garlic with the garlic bread.  They have cheap PBRs too.  We came right after work on a weeknight, so there was plenty of space.  Will try again!<//Text>

<Text>Great taps. The food looked really good. I was here on vacation up find Pliny the elder. I would come back for sure. It seems like it'd be a fun place to hang out. Bench tables to sit at. Enough of a family atmosphere. Definitely give it a try.< /Text><date>1568597891298</date><userid>109324671510610769627<//userid></record></dataset><record>

Pizza Port Ocean Beach is an amazing spot with some of the best pizza and the best brews that you will find in Ocean Beach. Make sure to stop by every day before 3 for that lunch special. 🍕🍕<//text>

<review>This is the Pizza Port Ocean Beach around. The tomatoes on top aren't overly tart, it's perfect. Plus the cornmeal crust ensures that it won't come out soggy. Must try.</review>< pictures>

Stopped here on the last day of our trip and it was delicious.  Too bad we hadn't found it earlier as I am sure we would have eaten there more then once. The pizza was hot and fresh with a crispy crust. Staff was polite and helpful.</Review>

Yummy pizza in a relaxed (& bustling) atmosphere! I loved the simple cheese pizza and my family loved the huge selection of craft beer! A great spot to be able to sit and enjoy pizza while being able to grab our own drinks and enjoy one another’s company.</review>

The service is super fast and friendly! We got the veggie basket and large pizza. The dough was really good although the pizza was alright nothing to write home about. They definitely had good variety of beer, pizza and other appetizers.< /Text>

Really great atmosphere here.  Beer is good to great.  Pizza is good to great.  You can't go wrong either way. Do a flight, then settle on a full pour of beer.  As for the pizza, do what you like.</Text>

The service is always also stellar.  Cannot say enough about the team down here in Ocean Beach today.

Good pizza place.  I ordered wings and the clam and shrimp pizza, both were really good.  Service was great.  Dog friendly (they even provided a bowl and bottled water for the dog).  They have turned their parking lot into out door seating to accommodate the required social distancing, it works really well.<//Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>So the beer here is obviously a must and they have great prices on flights so you should totally get those.

Some of the pizzas are great and others are not though. I’ve found that if I specialize my pizza it’s way better. A plain pepperoni or cheese isn’t all that great but if you double the cheese it’s awesome! The buffalo chicken is probably the best one- it’s awesome all by itself.

Really cool atmosphere and definitely a place you can bring big groups of people because they have super large picnic style tables.

dog friendly.< /text>< pictures>

Burma Superstar has good food and a nice atmosphere. But the wait is just not worth it when there are other great Burmese places within walking distance. If you don't mind waiting, this is a good experience, but Mandalay on California has just as good if not better food, and is a short walk away, without nearly as much wait.< /Review>

Was on a family vacation to San Diego and needed a good pizza stop. This place is really good. Nice thick crust, plenty of toppings, and saved really well too. Kept it in our AirBnb for a few days and was yummy each day.</review>

Huge variety of beer on tap. Best pizza in San Diego, specially the one with artichoke and pepperoni. Opens till late night, so it’s a really good choice to go after a long day walking around the city.< /Review>

We were visiting from Chicago and thoroughly enjoyed the three pizzas we tried. The ingredients were fresh, and the pizza was flavorful. The environment seemed very fun and vibrant--we took our pizza to go, so we didn't try any of the beer, but the list was extensive. The most interesting pizza we had was the San Clemente. We also had the Bacon Cheeseburger and Garlic Veggie. I would be happy to eat any of these pizzas again!</text>

My friends and I started day drinking at just 30 minutes past noon. Our friend hit it hard and passed out and we thought pizza could save him, and while he didn’t wake up, this pizza certainly saved us. We were pleasantly surprised as this was our first time eating here, and we were genuinely impressed by the service, quality of food, and how fast we got it. 10/10.</review>

There is plenty of seating inside and although it was a bit crowded, my group of 6 found a place to sit.

Delicious pizza and suds! We beat the Sunday crowd by getting there at 5pm. It was busy by 6pm, but the food came out quick enough for us, but appetizers helped. There's a food only line on the right. Food and brew line to the left. Ask for samples of their brews.
Pizza was nice and doughy, but not thick like pan pizza, not too thin either. Loads of toppings!!!
The Carlsbad was outstanding... hope you like artichoke, pesto and feta😉. BBQ cheeseburger had meatballs, not ground beef, I liked it more than I thought I would. I was expecting weird, but the meatballs made it seem more traditional.
Wings were baked, not bready. (The way i like it)
We got the veggie basket as a side, it was ideal for a family of 4 or two really hungry people.
For you beer bodies, they offer cans, growlers, and 6 packs to go.
There's a small parking lot adjacent and there's a pay to park across the street. If you want free parking, plan on street parking and walking a block or two.< /Text>

Pizza was excellent. Beer was awesome. The lines were quite long, and with 15 or 20 people in line together inside to order it was confusing how safe that could be. Not the fault of Pizza Port, just an observation.  I'd still go back though!< /text>

Chaotic fun pizza place that is very family-friendly. Long family style tables that are congenial to meeting people. It was pretty crowded when I was there which was why I said it was chaotic but we still got our pizza in a very reasonable amount of time. Huge beer selection. Pizza was good.< /text>

<username>Holly Richardson<//username><resp>None</resp><Review>Killer pizza! This place does not disappoint. Dropped in with a group of college friends who were staying in Ocean Beach.

Pizza Port has a very chilled, laid-back vibe. We were quickly able to find a long table that accommodated our group. Note, that the tables are shared, so don't be afraid to chat up your neighbor.

Pizza took about 35 mins to bake, and we enjoyed few rounds of beer while waiting, along with the jalapeno poppers (highly recommend!). We tried the Garlic Veggie Pizza w/ traditional crust. Super fresh veggies and gooey cheese.

We will defiantly be back on our next trip to SD!<//Review><user_id>113259853121332864859</user_id>< GmapID>

Yummy. The food never disapoints. We got two small pizzas,  wings and a veggie basket along with Swamis beer.  Everything was cooked exactly how we had hoped. We love taking pizza port to the cliffs to enjoy a mini picnic. The carlsbad is my favorite pizza.  Very different with the pesto, sun dried tomato, chicken, artichokes and feta cheese. The flavor bursts in your mouth. Every bite seems to have a slightly different flavor. When you get all the components on one piece...WOW.  My boyfriend prefers a more classic meaty pizza. The sausage was delicious.<//text>

THEY FINALLY HAVE VEGAN CHEESE!!! Now I can enjoy a full pizza with all my friends. Thank you!

Always good pizza, good beer selection, and now a vegan- and allergen-friendly selection for those who don't eat dairy.< /review>

A staple amongst the many amazing breweries in San Diego. Really enjoyed some of the beers and the laid back ambiance. Was also very pumped to find Pliny the Elder on tap. Great service as well, highly recommended.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I have been a fan of Pizza Port for many years. They keep the menu simple with pizza, salad, breadsticks, mozzarella sticks, and buffalo chicken wings and craft beer and soda and iced tea. I love all their food and they have lunch specials, like two slices and a drink or a slice, salad, and a beverage (non-alcoholic), and a couple other options. You can substitute a beer for an additional charge. They have the proper social distancing protocols on keeping your mask on when you are not seated at your table. You have to ask for napkins, utensils, parmesan cheese, or red pepper flakes.
The service is friendly and helpful. I fully recommend this Pizza Port in Ocean Beach, San Diego.
The toughest part about the Ocean Beach (OB) location is parking is scarce. Especially with the social distancing protocols in place, they took over the small 7 parking spot lot for outdoor dining.</review>< pics>

One of the older pizza port locations. This family friendly restaurant is always loud and full of energy, but this create that ambiance. Outstanding beer selection which includes pizza port beers as well as local breweries and collaborations. Good specials on beers they want to move. Pizza is pretty good too!< /text>

Love this place!  The pizza is really good.  The crust is fluffy and perfect.  The atmosphere is very relaxed.  You go to the counter to order your pizza and beer, grab a seat and relax.  They have their own beer which is great and also have a rotating selection of other brews as well.<//text>

< review>
The beer buddies were super good with our beers. The price in the area can't be beat. If you get the $3 pints and a small pizza and some beer buddies it's a perfect meal for two. This is a favorite for us for date night! Love their chronic ale, easily my favorite.
----------------Editted a few months later-----------------

Edit: From five to three stars for super rude staff. First I tried to order slices and the bartender told me they weren't doing slices so I ordered two small pizzas. Before my order came up I watched several people order and pick up individual slices. So I then had two small pizzas and needed some to-go boxes. They normally have them sitting out to help yourself. They didn't have any available so I requested two boxes from the staff. The busser said to me "two boxes? Why do you need two boxes?" I explained I had two pizzas but he retorted with "uh huh." I allowed my -well over 21- boyfriend to sample my beer (he didn't want one but wanted to try it) and we had the busser inform us that he couldn't taste my drink without getting ID'ed by the bartender and then said if he saw it again he would "have to bounce us". Asking for an ID would have sufficed. He absolutely did not need to treat us like we were breaking the law. This is a brewery, you have to assume people will sample each other's drinks. It's not accepted to threaten to remove someone from the property over it without requesting an ID first.

I don't know if they were recently hit with a fine or what but this behavior is a little wild. This place has been a favorite of ours for years and the entire atmosphere totally flipped. I hope that this trend doesn't continue because it makes it extremely uncomfortable to dine and relax.< /review>

<Text>Pizza Port is an awesome hangout spot with delicious pizza (lots of custom options) & beers/ales/ciders. It can get pretty crowded at times & the seating is far more casual than most other places you'd go, but it's perfect for group hangouts. I love the ambiance.<//Text>< pictures>

Local OB pizza spot. It has a great beer selection as well as pizza! It gets packed in pretty good so I'd suggest going early.<//Text>

<Review>Good beer, pizza and vibes. Don't remember what beer I ordered but it was a blonde ale and it was good. Ordered a San Francisco pizza and enjoyed. This was my son and I's first stop once we landed on his first visit to San Diego.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWv9x8Pesl1-W1xaDBMJbvp8nqpXxk7MNwzgpV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

<review>Awesome beer selection in an informal setting, with very good pizzas to line the stomach. My favourite beer place with food in OB, perhaps in all of San Diego.

Pizza port is great. The pizza is next level good. The crust in fluffy and thick. There are plenty of creative pizzas you can order or you can make your own. The apps are delicious, grab some beer buddies! Speaking of beer, they brew their own amazing beer in house. Try some!<//Text>

I love this place! Great gluten free pizza. Food and fun for the whole family. Great location walking, biking, skateboarding distance from anywhere in OB. Parking gets cramped so if you don't have to drive, leave the car at home.< /review>

Pizza Port's OB location is a staple for every one of my visits to the area. It captures the spirit of the area so well - surf, beer, and a loose and casual feel. Just a little off the main drag, it's within easy reach for tired surfers and rubbernecks alike, and makes a fine choice when Hodad's is running a line around the corner.

First, I've really only had the pizza. And it's good, competing with NY Slice style pizza around San Diego (East Coasters might turn their nose up at the place, FWIW.) I've also sampled the kale salad which was inappropriately healthy given the settings. The real treat here is the beer, which is always diverse, experimental, affordable, and delicious. Pizza Port's social media game has been overshadowed by newer players, but the brewing and taste is still on point, and matches supremely with the pizza available.

Head in during the lunch special and get away with two slices and a beer for less than $10, then get back to the beach with your newly acquired gut. Or return to the main street and go shopping, if you can resist the temptation to nap.<//review>

<rating>2<//rating><Text>WARNING: Do NOT place orders via ChowNow.

I've been a regular at the OB and Solana Beach Pizza Port locations since childhood.

Yesterday, I placed an order online for pickup at the OB Pizza Port via ChowNow.  I arrived 15 minutes after receiving the notification that the food was ready.  Due to an error between the shop and ChowNow, my order was never received so I waited for it to be prepared (outside, standing on the curb due to COVID restrictions) after being quoted 15 minutes.  30 minutes later, I checked on the progress and was informed that I had been made the incorrect pizza and that they would finish the one I ordered in 10 minutes.  One hour after I initially arrived to pick up my food, I finally received what I ordered.

The women who served me were very kind and offered the incorrectly-made pizza for free in addition to what I ordered, which I really appreciated.  Unfortunately, because I had to wait an hour to receive my order, my girlfriend missed a seminar she needed to attend.  Going forward, I unfortunately won't be providing my business to the OB location.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Wow! Almost passed it up because we generally don't like crowded places.. So glad we didn't! We will probably return everytime we come out to San Diego. We got the twice baked wings and Monterey pizza and were definitely not disappointed! Not to mention the amazing beer they have. 😍🍺<//Text>

The pizza was well done, not overly greasy like some can be and had a tasty crust.  We also ordered a salad which was decent.

We then had pizza slices, which were huge, the biggest I have ever seen and needed 2 plates for each one. Not only were the slices big, they were so so good.
Ideal place for a pizza lunch.<//Text>

<text>Pizza port. Are u kidding me right now pizza port is ridiculously delicious. Nothing less than 5 stars. I'd give 10 if I could. Grew up on the pizza port in Solana beach. The best pizza in San Diego. Must try have and love. And enjoy. Again And again:)< /text><username>Kami Pentelute< /username><resp>None</resp>< rating>

< review>
I've become a port fan over the year. A single slice vs a fresh pie is the reason for 1 less star. The pies come out a little thicker compared to a slice. I've never understood why they are different. They have the best prices for beer, slice and salad. If you haven't been give it a try.< /review>

<text>Great atmosphere for all ages! Plenty of beer choices on tap, and the pizza is delicious. A lot of seating inside and there is a patio outside. You'll find families with toddlers to younger couples having a great time. Definitely worth a visit when you're in OB!< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Pizza Port is an awesome communal lively food and beer garden that I would be happy to frequent if I lived in the area. Instead I'll just frequent it every time I come to town. The pizza is wonderful the beer is flavorful and strong and the environment is very very welcoming.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBtagkIHx3d21Udhy2oFj20nVgfaOU0gfViZat=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

People should know that pizza port has great pizza, buy the slice or whole and great beer. They always have lunch a lunch special you get pizza and a salad and soda for $6 something and if you don't want the soda  you can get a beer for $1 off or try there beer specials usually have a $3 beer special and a $4 beer special. We were there today and had the lunch special and a great IPA for a great price. I recommend you check them out. Can't go wrong.<//Review>

<username>Marco Naranche< /username><text>Awesome representation of the super chill Ocean Beach vibe. Great pizza, even better beer, and there is always a place to sit, even when it’s busy (which it almost always is). If you enjoy either, I highly recommend you make the trip. You won’t be disappointed. If you are, you clearly don’t keep it real.<//text>< userid>

It was okay. I was disappointed because I took my kids here SPECIFICALLY to have some of their house-made root beer and when I ordered it, was told that the machine was broken. Oddly enough, that was the same story I got when I visited the Solana Beach location a couple of years ago. Regardless, if they're not going to offer an item, I think that the menu board should note that it's not available. Also, I ordered the lunch special and when I told the clerk what type of pizza I wanted, she replied that the only options were cheese, pepperoni, or the pizza of the day. The menu board says "any slice pizza" - again, if it's only certain types of pizza that are available with the special, then the menu should note that, not say "Any." I ordered the pizza of the day and it was yummy. It was hot and fresh, and the servings were large. The orders came out in a reasonable amount of time. If you're not a regular, it's a little unclear what you're supposed to do after you're finished eating - bus your own table? Leave it there? Some signage would help with that too. All in all, it was an ok experience. I wouldn't drive out of my way to go there again (like I did this time) and circle the block again & again looking for parking, but if I was already in the area, I'd eat there.<//Text>

<review>I am going to give this place at 4 stars because the service is amazing and the pizza is really good. They have a lot of very interesting combinations and their vegetarian options particularly good. The beer is really good too.The only downside is the seating and how loud it can get nside the actual restaurant. Other than that, yeah definitely worth the trip.< /review>< username>

Pizza is good. Beer selection is great. Lunch deal is best in town. Only draw back is it gets a little noisy and beer quantity restrictions prevent you from buying a round for friends. You all have to get up and get in line.<//Text>

I like this location a lot, and visit every time I'm in San Diego. The beers & pizza always satisfy, and the beach-side town casual vibe works. I would just note that my last visit was more like a scene from Chuck E Cheese, so choose your day & time of day accordingly!< /Text>

Just like the other Pizza Ports, this place has an amazing and delicious selection of beer and pizza.  The Carlsbad is our favorite.  If you're meeting anyone here, make sure your arrive a little early...  The parking can be a bit difficult at times.< /text>

Always a great place to visit when near the beach. The pizzas are ALWAYS delicious and their regularly changing choice of local brews is great for any taste. For the folks looking for a non alcoholic choice, they have an outstanding root beer on tap.< /Text>

We enjoy coming here for the fun vibes! It's a fun family friendly pizza place with several rows of long picnic tables and a large (wonderful) beer selection. Super laid back and can get crowded especially on weekends but they do have pizza by the slice lunch specials which is nice and usually quick.<//Review>

Too many superlatives about their beers and pizza. Super fun place, totally kid-friendly but gets jam-packed, yet well worth the search for a seat. Feel free to ask folks to share their table. Oh, and get the wings and request them twice-baked. you won't be disappointed</Review>

<review>Kinda disappointed.  I love their chronic amber ale but not impressed with the pizza or apps.   Too much cheese on pizza.  We got Hawaiian but maybe should have stuck with traditional pizza.   Awesome shirts for purchase & arcade.< /review>< pics>

One of my favorite places in San Diego! Amazing (and always changing) beer selection! Delicious and fresh pizza! They also have vegan options (if that’s your thing). BBQ Chicken pizza is dank and I’ve never been disappointed with their beer selection. I go here regularly. Every time I am in OB, I make it a point to stop by Pizza Port!</Review>

Less than impressed. Packed, seating was first come first serve and they only sold slices after a certain time of the day.< /Review>

<Text>Came here on a Tuesday night after hittin up a couple bars (one was a saloon type bar and the other a bbq spot). Got 3 huge slices of pizza for 8.50 which could have added up to almost a whole pizza. Its very hard for me to find a delicuous pizza spot that me and my GF like but this place was great. Delicious pizza.<//Text>< pics>

Their beer selection was good and a number of their own beers are quite good. One of the cashiers was kinda short and rude but the place was busy so maybe he was having a hard night. Definitely nothing special to make me come back here and wasn't worth finding parking for.< /text>< username>

<review>Fantastic, absolutely fantastic! So many delicious pizza options and a beer menu that goes on for days, what more could you ask for?

Went here for the first time for dinner with a group of co-workers. Ordered the Pizza Lahaina, Pizza Laguna, and Pizza San Clemente (love the pizzas named after California beaches). Each pizza was more scrumptious than the next! I never would have believed that a pizza with black bean sauce as its base could be so good but it was a revelation. My favorite was the Lahaina, but I'm one of those people who likes pineapple on a pizza with Canadian bacon.

Great, laid-back atmosphere at this place. The next time I'm in San Diego, Pizza Port will be on the short-list of places to go!< /review>< Pictures>

<text>Beer, beer, and more beer.   And by the way they have pizza too! We went here For a birthday celebration. We ordered about five pizzas which were all gourmet ranging from a vegetarian option to a garlic and meat combination.  There were games for the kids to play while we socialized with the adults. Super fun vibe and very good food. They had so many different kinds of beer available that it was mind blowing.  The food was out within 15 minutes of ordering it, the beer was cold, and the staff was on point. We will definitely be back</text><user_id>113234674907496415823</user_id>< resp>

Sone of the best IPAs in town, especially when its wet hop season. If your hungry order the pizza. The San Francisco pizza is my personal favorite and pairs nicely with a dank pizza port IPA.< /Review>

Always good beer and good pizza at Pizza Port! I had only been to the San Clemente location before but OB's flights were cheaper and had some really great options. We loved the Flyin' Hawaiian. The pizza had lots of seasoning on it, which I enjoyed< /Review>

What a drag. If they cleaned it up, wiped down the area regularly os whatever it takes, it would make this location 5 stars. Amazing brewery, delicious comfort food, good atmosphere, no pretentious attitudes, just a great and legendary local treasure.<//text>< Pictures>

Two things, the pizza was delicious! The customer service was trash! If you want some ranch dressing with your pizza then expect attitude from the guy at the counter. The attitude was uncalled for and very humiliating. The pizza was so good that I reluctantly (because of the fear of getting attitudes) went twice in one week. You probably can't go wrong with any pizza on the menu.<//Text>

<Text>The best Pizza Port location. It can get packed, but there is a good flow to the place, so it's never a problem. The pizza is one of the best in San Diego. My favorite is the veggie with added grilled chicken. Recently tried a specialty sausage and jalapeno that was impressive as well. The selection of beers never disappoints. Especially when they bring out the specialty casks, which often is around Beer Week or during their Anniversary, etc. Highly recommend. One of the best spots to grab a drink and bite in OB.</Text>< Date>

Pizza Port is never NOT a good choice for food. Unless you hate fun. Then it's a terrible place 😂< /review>

<Review>We loved this place! Our lyft driver was telling us how great it was before we even walked in the door, so they obviously have a following. They have tons of pizza options in addition to simple build-your-own and their traditional crust option really filling, almost like a colorado mountain pie style pizza. They also have a huge beer selection. The vibe is very casual and fun; we came in at like 9:30pm during a baseball game and on one side of us we had a big family with young kids watching the TVs and on the other side a big group of rowdy young guys who were playing a drinking game. Definitely a place for everyone!<//Review>< resp>

Finding parking can be difficult at times but the pizza is definitely still worth a try. Admittedly, my jaw did kind of get tired from biting down on the crust. Also, the music can be very loud so prepare for that. Otherwise, will gladly bring a friend to show them this place!</Text>

<text>Pizza is unique, they really have their own exquisite pizza bread. Now.lets be honest allnpizzas carry the same condiments but what truly gives a pizza its unique flavor is the bread and its sauce.< /text>< UserId.>

A consistent family favorite.  "California" style pizza is always delicious.

Excellent craft brew selection from lager to ale to IPA to Porter - all good.  Try the non-alcohol brewed root beer.  It all hits the spot.</text>

<Text>This is hands down the best pizza in San Diego. They have they best pizza creations I've ever seen, and the best part is that they're all delicious.
In addition to making great pizza, they have a giant board with a wide variety of beers, some even brewed in house. They serve almost every type of beer. One glass per ID tho.</Text>< pictures>

The pizza is really good (with some unconventional but tasty toppings - e.g. butternut squash) and the beer selection is excellent, but it took about 50 minutes to get ours after ordering with no notice it would take that long. Also the root beer was watery (the strong ale I got was sweeter). We arrived at 7pm Saturday evening. I would recommend going off main hours or when planning to wait a while (with some pitchers of whatever deal they have going). Under such conditions I might give 4 stars.<//Text>

If going with young children get there before 6:30. And bring dollars or coins for the super engaging and convenient game corner.  I love all the pizza. And the kale salad. And the root beer, which they will float for you if you ask. Parking is temperamental as expected for the area.</Review>

It's a relaxed place with long benches that are first come first serve. The pizza is awesome. And the beer is great too!

Great deal for lunch:  2 slices and a beer.  Great location.  Great staff.  Especially the guy calling out orders that were ready.  He, and the beer, earn 5 stars alone.  Then add great pizza.<//Text>

< Review>
Great for a crowd. Went for a birthday party with a group of six. We ordered individually and ordered too much food. Medium pies are quite large. They offer many different preset pizza options along with a create your own. We had the Mac and Cheese bites to start and they were good. Lots of video games and entertainment for the kids. Also a craft brewery on the premise. Very laid back experience. Order at the window and they call out your name to pick up the order. The announcer took some liberties with his announcements and created some smiles. Would go back with a crowd. Would not go by myself.<//Review>

I love their "wings" night on thursday's!  At 49 cents each it's a good deal, but it's only for "Dine In"  I would go early because it gets very busy and very crowded.  They are a very popular spot!  They're wings are great (though I've only tried a few different ones.)  I love their pizzas and the selection.  They can come up with some unusual combinations, but they're fun to try!  I hear (through people I go with and family members) that their beers are fantastic!  Great selection and reasonably priced.  I would recommend Pizza Port, but if you don't like crowds go on a week night (Monday or Tuesday) or during the week before 6pm.<//review>

A fun and lively place. It was hard to find seating due to how packed it was. The margherita pizza was not cut well so the pieces would tear when I tried to pull one out and the tots were quite mushy. Had a good time with my friends.<//Review>

My friends make fun of me for how much I love this Pizza Port. Honestly though, it never fails to be delicious and satisfying. The beer list always has the best, most fresh selection. The people who work the bar are the friendliest dang people and actually know their beer and don’t just fake like they know it. If I could go here every night of my life and not gain weight, I would. Around 6 is definitely family time, but go after 7:30 and there’s plenty of room for people. They always have good games and events on! I really can’t express how much I love Pizza Port.</text>

Pretty good casual spot for a pizza and beer! The guy behind the bar was super friendly and nice. I’d stick to the pizzas as we had some Mac and Cheese bites to start and they were underwhelming to say the least. Batter isn’t very good, crumbed would have made them wayyyy better and tastier. Be willing to share tables with others as they are beer hall type benches to sit on.<//Review>

Great food, exceptional beer - wish more restaurants carried it. Swami's IPA and their Chronic Amber are worth a trip for.</review>

<Text>I love the bressi ranch pizza. Pizza port has always been one of my favorite pizzas. The thick crust that is crunchy but soft, the sauce is fantastic. The different pizza styles are very well put together. There are great lunch speacials and the beer really sets the par for me.<//Text><userid>118281283168865235706< /userid>< Gmap_id>

Hands down my favorite pizza joint ever. Carlsbad location is great too, but to people watch & get that ocean air, this is the one. Delicious beer selection. My out of town guests always want to go here & good place for kids to chill with the family too. Or leave the rugrats with grandma & keep all the pizza to yourself. Better idea.<//review>

One of my favorite places to go. Great service, from nice people, beer selection can't be beat, and the pizza is delicious. When you go, get the cherry cider if its available. I dream of this cider....it is the BEST!</text>

The beer was good and they had a good selection. However, there were multiple flies buzzing around and a child having a meltdown that reduced the enjoyment of the visit.

They have unbeatable prices on select beers and you can also get pizza by the slice of you're not interested in splitting a pizza.<//Review>< UserId.>

<Text>Timing is everything coming here. A friend and I stopped by around 11 and it was quiet and calm. We got some food and drinks, but after about an hour kids were showing up. It is more family oriented so keep that in mind. Pizza and pretzels were nothing special, a little bland at times. But the garlic bread was delicious.</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80deaa3a261cd2e3:0x3e89464c53bf352< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Pizza port is relaxing place to have a good piece of pizza and a beer. They have many on draft,  And they change frequently. It's very close to the ocean and there's a large traffic for good people watching.< /Text>

Good pizza. Large selection. More expensive than most pizza restaurants. Really cool atmosphere. Very unique. Order your pizza at the counter and when it’s finished they will call you up to get your food. The wait varies on busyness. The seating is mostly long wooden indoor picnic tables, so during busy times, you have to be cool with sitting right next to strangers.</Review>

<text>Very tasty pizzas (the garlic veggie and bbq chicken are some of our favorites). The kale salad is surprisingly delicious. The mac n cheese bites were a bit of a let down, but the wings were good. They have a variety of beers on draft and occasionally a cider as well. It's a bit loud inside and the seating outside doesn't offer much of a view, but it's still a fun spot to check out and is very close to Ocean Beach. Parking nearby is a bit of a nightmare, but if your willing to pay or walk a few blocks you can easily find some.<//text>< pictures>

<text>The pizza is delicious, the crust is the best. We ate the veggie garlic, the large fed the four of us perfectly. Chased the pizza with a pitcher of chronic Amber. Parking was kinda tricky I ended up paying $10 for 2hr-6hr by gold's gym, seems like everywhere around Mission Bay you have to pay for parking.< /text>< gmapID>

We visited Pizza Port about 10pm on a weekend night to take a pizza pie home to-go. The prices for a small whole pie were surprisingly affordable at 8-11 dollars per pie. Sprinkled with a few dashes of red pepper flakes, we had ourselves a kickin’ late night dinner.

While waiting for the pizza, I had a chance to check out the restaurant/bar/dining/game area.  The place was filled with arcade games, pizza smells, and families. It was like an adult Chuck E. Cheese’s done in a good way.  They’ve also got a pretty good beer selection on tap. We’ll have to come back and have a pizza in house someday.</Review>

Great beer, great food! First time there. A bit crowded, but it was farmers market; I also figured that with it that crowded it must be decent food. I would definitely recommend it and would return for sure.<//review>

This place is awesome! It has the ocean beach feel with open seating, large pizza menu and an even bigger craft beer menu. Definitely check it out! Outdoor seating is also available if you have your dog with you.</Text>

I would give 5 stars for the beer and their bartenders, but baking section and their staff is very rude and gross. My pizza had a hair inside and the guy instead of apologizing was being rude. Ever since they have new staff in baking sections, their quality of service as well as pizza is going down!<//review>

<Text>I am not a huge beer drinker, but my friends like beer, so I understand the appeal of this place. The pizzas are pretty good, but I could see how they would be much better paired with a beer. :-) They have good specials, and have hot wings and cheese sticks, but they are nothing special. Friendly staff and a welcoming atmosphere- but this place gets busy, and has cafeteria style benches set up, so you have to try to find somewhere to sit quick if it is busy and large groups can be hard.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>Pizza is great and so is the beer. Great place for families. If you don't have a family however you might want to take your pizza elsewhere as it is very loud and chaotic inside the restaurant. Parking can be a very difficult so plan accordingly.<//Review>< Pictures>

Great pizza and beer! Gazillion selection of local and craft beer from the tap. Watch out for the long line, although line moves fairly fast for pizza order. There are separate and relatively much shorter line for beer, so order your pizza first. Family friendly environment.</review>

Seating isn't the best and it's probably best to call in an order to go. Our problem was that we have a one year old, and had no where to go with a baby seat. So it's probably best to grab and to if you have a child.

There is a HUGE beer selection! So if you're dining in, try making a check list to mark them off as you go. As for pizza, the pizza is better than average but nothing over the line.< /review>

Also ordered a Large Pizza to go,and it was regular crust,and we ordered Wheat. I  contacted Zack the GM,but after he asked for some information from me, he disappeared off the grid. Sadly , I will not return to Pizza Port after being brushed away by the GM.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Pricy for the quality of pizza. Very bland. Didn't try other items so I can't say for that. But pizza was whatever.
Way too crowded and super noisy. And you seat yourself. Some people will come and sit right next to you which I don't like and some will let their kids climb were you are eating (the seats are wooden park tables that are lined up next to each other in rows) . I think it's a place for those who don't have kids. Big selection of alcohol. Staff is really nice!< /text>

The lunch special is a great way to go, but for the life of me I can't figure out the how/why of the additional $2 charge to add a beer to the meal as this only gives you a $2 discount when you go to the beer counter to get your beer.  So I've paid the $2 add on for my pizza salad to get a beer then get a $2 discount?  Why not just pay full price for my beer and save a step.

Anyway, the pizza, salad, and beer really hit the spot and provided a great base to build on for a full day of brewery hopping!  Would definitely go back.<//text><Date>1470587551502<//Date></record></dataset><record>

We came here for lunch. We had the Meet Extreme Meat. It was packed with meat and very delicious. They also have a great selection of beer especially IPAs. There is plenty of seating indoor or outdoor. Pet friendly as many people brought their dogs.

We will definitely be coming here again when we are in the area.

We bought a six pack of El Camino which was a recent release in cans to go.<//review>

Unfortunately after today we will take our money to Newport Pizza and other establishments in our community. We asked to order a pitcher of beer and the snobby gentleman pouring beer said he would not serve that beer in a pittcher, witch is totally cool. Until he went about tulip glasses and head assuming we were beer experts. We were just looking for a good beer and good not to be reprimanding by a college kid for ordering beer "the wrong way". Bye Pizza Port we had a good run. It's sucks a few of you're employees don't take the Service Industry seriously and have ruined a good thing for hard working people from the neighborhood.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

You can't go wrong with pizza port. Plenty of great beer on tap, available by the pitcher. Picnic table style common seating inside the brewery/restaurant. Great pizzas to enjoy with some good friends (or even just by yourself with a pitcher of beer, I wouldn't judge you). What else could you want?<//review>

The pizza and beer selection are very good. Lots of topping choices for the pizzas and a good sized menu overall.
We went on a Thursday night and it was extremely crowded. A 10 minute wait in line just to order. The seating was full and we were crowded into the benches. There were kids running all over and very loud. Not a great experience but it's hard to blame the business for being busy.<//text>

<review>Pizza was really nice !! The perfect match pizza and beer. I   won't take a star from you guys and please you have to get a solution for those tables. They are cover in years of pizza oil. About the disposable dishes also you could have real dishes , I mean it's a restaurant after all and you have where to wash them. Again ! This is a place you should stop and get pizza with family or friends.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

The location really sells this place. It's close to the beach and near the heart of Ocean Beach town. The beer is alright by San Diego standards, and definitely priced fairly. I have not had food here, but my eyes were certainly jealous of pizzas passing by our table.<//Review>

Great pizza! They have an excellent craft beer selection as well. It's a popular place, so it is usually crowded. The wait time is not bad though.</Text>

I am so lucky to live close to Pizza Port!  All my friends wish that there is a Pizza Port in their neighborhood!!!   You can imagine how good the pizza is from the Pizza Port.  It is a little pricey, but is totally worth it!!!< /text>

The beer is phenomenal, both their own brews and the high quality offerings on the guest taps. The pizza is probably great...for San Diego. However, if you're from the Northeast, you won't be very impressed by the chewy, doughy, carb-bomb crust. Of course, if you need something to soak up the delicious beer, the pizza or the pizza bites are a good call. But again, this place is all about the beer. That's why you want to come here.< /Text>

Loud, enjoyable bar/pizza restaurant. They have a large, visible brewery. The pizza is delicious and the place is perfect for football with TVs all around the restaurant. They also have a miniature arcade for the kids. Unfortunately, there is often little parking.
That's the only con though!</text>

<Text>Pizza port makes my second favourite pies ever (sorry, but there's no taste like home). I love their Lahaina pizza. They also are one of the best breweries in OB. Flying Hawaiian is one of my favourite beers and I really wish they packaged it for retail so I could get it more often!</Text></record>

This spot has great pizza. I normally go there during lunch time. The line is not long to order your food nor is there a long wait time to receive your food.<//Review>

A tad on the crowded side, albeit for a reason. The food is great, the environment fun and they offer great beer. Parking, however, like everywhere in OB, sucks. Park a bit away and get a scooter.</Text>

The pizza can be a little pricey, but it's good. The beer is also good, especially their own brewed beer. And you can go with your dogs. It just gets packed on the patio that you can sit with your dogs. You also need to have your ID to get beer. If you are buying beer for a friend you need to bring their ID up with you when you are buying the beer.< /text>

The pizza is a little thick and saucy for my taste (I am more of NY pizza girl)  but the ingredients are always very fresh and yummy.  On weekend evenings are very crowded, but lunchtime is not that bad.  They have a good lunch special, a slice, and salad; both are HUGE. Big enough for sharing if you are not so hungry.  If you are in the area give it a try.  Very fun atmosphere!<//Review>< pics>

You can get better pizza from a Little Caesar's. Not impressed. Unbelievably bland. If they would use basil and garlic even a little bit they might salvage at least the pizza on the menu. The Mac n cheese bites were garbage. Thank God they give you ranch and marinara so I was able to stomach 2 pieces of pizza and 2 Mac n cheese bites. But that runs out real quick. I didn't even take my 3/4 of a pizza to go. From the wise words of my sister that is also a kindergarten teacher.... "Suck Less!"< /Text>

Always happy with this place. Sometimes it's hard to find a seat on the weekend nights, so be aware of that when coming with a group larger than 2/3. We love the pep/bacon pizza and their IPAS! Always bring our out of town friends when they visit.</text>

Once again, while looking for pizza we found this place and just the pictures of the food alone brought us into Pizza Port on a Saturday afternoon.  We came with our 3 children, and while I wouldn't necessarily call it a "family restaurant" I was comfortable with my two youngest being there because it's a loud, upbeat place where their noise levels would bother no one.
It took a few minutes to decide what we wanted, but we had an order of buffalo wings, which were dry rub and not super saucy, so they were good.  My littlest two each had slices of their favorite pizzas and the hubby and I each got a small, he had the San Clemente, and I the margherita pizza.  The individual slices were insane, they were bigger than the plates they were on.  The San Clemente has a black bean sauce, and it had this unique flavor that made me think I was eating somewhere between a taco and a pizza...it was quite good.  Then of course there was the Margherita pizza.  Not the best one I have ever had, but it was good and I would eat it again.   Truth be told though, I tasted the San Clemente first and it was so flavorful and yummy that maybe my tastebuds were a little screwy and the Margherita was just plain at that point.
We also enjoyed a Beer Float, something we'd discussed trying many many times, but had never actually come across.  We did at Pizza Port, and the options for beers in my float were amazing.  I went with a coffee porter and was pleasantly surprised.  Not gonna lie, I was skeptical, but I came out of this experience a fan.
This location is good for an afternoon slice and a cold beer or two.  Bringing the kids is totally fine, and going without them is totally fine too.
The atmosphere is laid back, the food is good, and the beer is cold.  What more could you ask for?< /review>

Great place for pizza slices and local brew.  The pricing on everything is well worth it, and every pizza that they make is very good.  Fresh toppings and a variety of different kinds of pies with interesting names.  A good place for 'za near the beach. Dog friendly too :)</text>

<text>The place is not bad, 2 slices and a soda or beer for $7, not bad though the pizza wasn't that great, it wouldn't be a place that I'd say "this is the place I'd like to go for a pizza".

<Text>The pizza and beer may or may not be great, but I will rate the place 1 star because they advertise slices and apparently do not sell them all day. I walked in around 7pm and waited in line as I saw slices priced on the menu board.  I ordered 2 slices and a beer.  I was told "we don't sell slices until 9pm".  I said you have to be kidding.  I was told "we don't sell slices after 3pm". It all worked out though as I went down a couple blocks and had an excellent burger, rings and a beer at a super friendly shop around the corner.  As far as this place goes... I will get my slices elsewhere.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Came here after hearing mixed reviews from friends, and it was alright. Plenty of beer options, friendly staff overall, but the pizza was ehh. Good size slices, but very thin and greasy. The long tables (like an elementary school cafeteria) could make for an awkward and uncomfortable meal if the people next to you are rude or loud, but it's OB so most people are chill.< /review><user_id>111213769146977228642</user_id>< GmapID>

It's kid friendly and has video game arcades too. The only thing I didn't like too much about it is the lack of seating available, but I guess that's what happens when you get great pizza and beer.

You basically order your pizza at the register and find a seat as fast as someone stands up. They will call your name over the loud speaker. No waiters here. Lots of fun. There is also another location (i think in Ocean Beach).<//Review><UserId.>111383592478796555412</UserId.></record>

<text>Pizza is very very good yet slightly overrated in comparison. Beer selection is all-time. Street side patio is a nice place to hang out outside and enjoy your grub. Inside seating feels like grade school cafeteria but it works out. Favorite part is the surf decor and overall vibe is just chilling.

Enjoyed a company party on the rooftop one time which was a unique and awesome experience. Very accommodating for groups.</text>< pictures>

Great pizza - super cheesey, with the toppings under the cheese! We had the Monterey pizza, which was excellent. Solid amount of toppings, and it stayed together really well.

Good selection of beers as well.

Seating is open, largely long picnic table-style seating indoors, and a patio outside. The patio closes about an hour earlier than the restaurant. It was crowded on a Wednesday night during Comic Con but we were still able to find a seat easily.< /review>

<text>From Wisconsin - HAD to check it out.  Great beer - wish I would've checked a bag so I could bring some home.  Definitely take an uber - you'll want to try multiple beers. Only took them until about the sixth round to stop asking me if I wanted to close my tab!<//text><name>Jamil Malik<//name><user>103096389836901983924<//user><Resp>None< /Resp>< Pictures>

You can't ever go wrong with a place that breaths drinks and makes awesome sauce in everything they ever do. Also the people who work and run this place are the bomb dot com.<//Review><pics>None< /pics></record>

Really great beer selection, with flight options of their own beers. Some more interesting beers along with the standard IPAs etc. Good atmosphere, friendly and laid back. Definitely a place you could take your kids for pizza while the adults enjoy some craft brews.</review>

Pizza port is a great brewery, and their pizza is good.   It used to be better but I think that once they started expanding it has been watered down a bit.   Their beers are great!< /text>

Absolutely love the pizza here! Would eat it every day if I could. Beer is fantastic as well. The only suggestion i would make is that the make the Eukarest Sinister Stout more often so I could bring more of it home!< /Text>

<review>5/5 for the beer and 3/5 for the pizza. Excellent beer selection in various types from light to dark and smooth to hoppy. Pizza is a tad doughy as should be cooked longer for some crisp.< /review>< pics>

Great pizza, lots of beer (and they were brewing while we were there).  Lots of people in the place with no A/C made it a tad bit warm, but still a fun atmosphere.  Parking is terrible, but there is a $5 lot just east of the restaurant.< /Text>

<Text>These guy have great pizza - but everyone knows that. Something that I love Pizza Port for is their amazing sour beer offerings. As a sour beer lover, I can't just go anywhere to get my fix but these guys deliver with a great selection. If you're not too keen on sour beer, don't worry - they've got a large A+ selection of beers.<//Text>< userid>

<text>Best pizza in town! Plus a great selection of mostly local and some imported brews. Shark bite ipa, Oatmeal beer, and even one with Pikachu on the logo are some of the ones I've tried recently, they're all great! Highly recommend! If you are trying to come around dinner time especially on the weekend, be prepared to fight for parking and seating. It's still worth 5 stars ^______^<//text>< pics>

<review>Great beers with a ton of different available styles. Had the margherita pizza and it was fantastic. The dough has a lot of great flavor and the toppings are super fresh.

Busy. VERY busy ... wasnt too impressed, although when I asked the hotel I'm staying at if they could lead me to a good pizza pie place, this was her opinion. . Took my 3 kids under age 6 and it just wasnt  what we were looking for. If your into craft beers of course this is your stop! Not a family oriented place for us.. very busy,packed and loud.</text>

This Pizza Port location has a a very "OB" vibe, as you might expect. A little beachy, a little bit hippie. Staff were super friendly. Gets packed on weekend nights, but still was able to find seating.<//Review>

<Text>Great spot but be prepared for a crowd and lots of kids.  The tables are pretty close together and it was a little difficult for me to transfer from my wheelchair to a bench seat but thats not the restaurants fault, it's the fault of the able-bodied family sitting at the only handicap accessible table. The employees are friendly and the pizza was stupid good. Great spot for a slice or a whole pie if you are in a group.  They do have a gluten free option for the crust but it's $3 more for those of you in need a GF option.  Plus they were advertising for a hemp beer that is brewed with hemp seeds, on the table that I think I will have to try out next time.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

You have to accept ahead of time that while being at pizza port, you are inevitably going to either bump into a another patron or staff member.  The place is small but from my most recent visits I've noticed that this is part of the charm (aside from the craft beer and hand made pizza) in that everytime I leave, I've made a new friend being dragged into the conversation of any adjacent groups.< /Text>

Beer + Pizza + Beach Town = Recipe for Nirvana ! Both the locations in Solana Beach and Ocean Beach are amazing - great selection of house and guest beers in a community style dining hall with great pizza and almost always great staff ... Never had a bad experience with these guys... Highly recommended!< /text>

<text>if i could leave negative one star review, i would. this place is horrible. food sucks, pizza sauce sucks, no subs or sandwiches, drink selection sucks. beer is superb tho. pizza port beer is very good. some employees there are very rude and disrespectful as well as some of the managers. but if you need a quick fix of overpriced poor quality pizza and beer to get a d.u.i. on the way home, go for it!!!!!!!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>Really good pizza, place was absolutely packed!!! The line for an alcoholic beverage was so long I didn't dare attempt, it was right after the Christmas parade so I'm sure it was much busier than usual.< /Review>< Pics>

Excellent Pizza and Craft Beer but it's more of an order up front then get your beer, find a seat, then wait for name to be called to get pizza. Still, pizza is bomb as are their Craft Beers!<//review>

<Review>This place is famous, so I decided to drive down and check it out. It was crowded and had so-so pizza. But good beer. Weird mix of families and hipsters. Not sure I'll seek it out specifically in the future, but if I'm in ob and craving pizza I'd probably go back.<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< rate>

The register lines are organized very weirdly. That is, they're generally disorganized. Meaning the already lethargic staff is further disadvantaged by confused customers waiting for service. The beer is great though!< /review>

It's hard to write anything bad about this place since it already has a winning combination of pizza and beer. Add a killer location (Ocean Beach) to the list, and you've got the recipe for a great afternoon or evening out.

If I were to say anything negative about the joint, is it's a bit crowded. Don't expect to come to Pizza Port and get a private table for two. All seating is community style, and the place is loud... so be in the mood to be social! And if you aren't, just have a pitcher of beer and you'll be adding to the noise level in no time :-)< /Text>

Great local hang out with their own beer unique to this location and guest taps.  All seating is family style and there are two lines for food but only one you can order beer from.< /text>

<text>Beer was good, pizza was great. Super busy. It is kind of annoying going with two people and one person saving a seat while the other orders food and then you switch out to finally get beer... Meh. Would rather go somewhere else next time but there was no problems with service or beer quality, so 4 stars.</text>< rate>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>BBQ Sliders, gormet personal pizza and kind beers all while hanging with good friends and watching some football. That is how to spend the end of October.

Also, a side note... I left my skateboard at the front after I ordered my beer. About 10 minutes later they called out over the loud speaker thay they had it behind the counter. I was super relieved as my daughter had juat done this herself a month earlier at a different place and she wasn't so lucky. This was my cruiser too. So, the wheels and trucks are basically brand new and the deck is unique as it is one I received after becoming a member of Skate for Change in 2012 a non-profit organization that gives back to their community.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

One of my favorite joints to grab a slice. Their garlic knots are heaven and the beer selection is pretty kick-ass as well. The service is always on point and this place gets hoppin' in the evenings. Grab a table, and your honey and hunker down for a piece o' pie and a brew.< /text>

This used to be the best pizza in OB but my last 2 visits were disappointing. The staff were not very attentive & the pizza crust was not great. I was there, both times, with 3 other people & we all had the same opinion. Next time I'm in the mood for pizza I'll be at pizza Port.</review>

<review>This place is terrible. It took them 50 minutes for a small pizza as I watched them serve a dozen people that came after me. I let them know at 30 minutes that I might have missed them calling my name (because they mumble into a microphone for literally a microsecond- your name instead of a number) so they get confused every time there’s a Mike or a Jen...  as a side note the men’s bathroom has one soap dispenser which is hella awkward when 2 people arrive at the dual sinks at the same time.... and I kid you not the hot water is boiling. Steam comes from it. The foods alright but you’re never gunna get it.< /review></record></dataset><record>

It's a laid back pizza joint near the beach.  It's basically exactly what you should expect.  It has a big beer menu, very good pizza and it's loud.  I will returning next time I'm in town.< /Review>

What's a regular beer. In my world, all beers are measured by pints or larger.< /review>< Pictures>

Just a really amazing pizza, wondering what time they close, just talking about it is making me want a slice or even a whole pie.  A must try.< /review>< pictures>

Terrific pizza and outstanding selection of brews on tap.  We were there during March Madness and the noise was a bit much but I think it was because of the games.< /review>

Really nice vibe here at PIzza Port. People are rough around the edges but overall pretty friendly. More often that not, every time I'm there, somehow another person's pizza slice ends up on my plate. It's strange but I don't fight it. Neither do the high number of dogs that can be found here during and after hours.

Also... they have big buck hunter. You're likely able to find many of the local 25 yr olds cocking shotguns and high-fiving while pounding wings on a wednesday night. Good vibes, although PP wing's have slowly slipped down hill like the arizona frat boys at nobes on a saturday.<//Text>

A hangout for locals for sure. Not very family friendly due to the 2 tvz with the Spike Channel on and 1000 ways to die was being shown at that time. Needless to say my elementary age kids were a bit shocked to see this show and we had to find a seat so they couldn't see those tv screens.< /text>< pics>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Didn't get a chance to try the beer but I am sure it is good based on reviews. I walked in and found a long line for a Beer and Food order counter. So I made my way to the bar where I asked the bartender if I could order just beer, and he said "sure" and took my beer order of two beers for me and my brother. He went to go grab the beers and was stopped by another employee. He then came back and informed us we had to wait in the long line to order anything. I have never seen such a complicated ordering setup just to get a beer at any other brewery.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>I give Pizza Port 5 stars for the beer and 4 stars for the food. However I have a lot of non-craft beer drinking friends that come here just for the food, so my standards might be high. To me the pizza is the perfect complement to their beer - doughy, cheesy and loaded with toppings. Their beers are very underrated compared to other breweries in San Diego, mostly because they make so many that aren't all world-class. But all of them are above average, priced fairly, and served fresh from the brewery in a casual family-friendly environment. Frequently Pizza Port creates some beers that really knock it out of the park (Santa's Little Helper, Mongo IPA, Bacon & Eggs Breakfast Coffee Porter, etc.) They have a generous amount of taps devoted to "guest brewery beers" including Russian River, Ballast Point, etc. Their homemade root beer is awesome, I recommend trying a float. Or try some of their "beer buddies" which is cooked pizza dough bites brushed with garlic butter.</Text>< Time>

< review>
The pizza is really just a vehicle to put out an extensive beer selection, but these sturdy brews are best reserved for beer connoisseurs, and are for those who like heavy-duty suds.  Zagat's 25 food rating is suspect, with pizza that only gets the job done; mediocrity for the undemanding.  If you want to go where the locals go though, and don't mind a lot of enebreated togetherness with them, it might be worth a try.  Not for kids at night.< /review>

Decent pizza, better beer.  I always love checking out all of the surfboards decorating the walls, but the awesome painting on the bottom of a longboard of OB from the jetty to the pier over by the beer taps takes the cake!  It can get busy at times, but always great place to take the groms for a good feed.<//review>

Good beer selection but I definitely don't plan on eating pizza in California again anytime soon.  It wasn't all that different from what you can get at a dominos.<//Review>

Came in with a group of friends for our last meal during our San Diego trip. Most of the group heard great things about Pizza Port, so it had to be a clear winner? Parking can be an issue with limited spots available, but luckily we found street parking about a block away.

The atmosphere of the restaurant looked fun and inviting. There were many flat screen TV's around the restaurant playing the football game. The seating reminded me of long park bench tables, big enough to fit large parties of 20 or 30. The craft beer bar is located on the left side of the restaurant while food is in the middle.

As far as food, Pizza Port offers premium gourmet pizzas. I originally wanted the Pizza SF but two friends had already ordered that, so I just randomly chose the featured month pizza, Teriyaki Chicken. It was just okay and I probably wouldn't get it again. The flavors didn't mesh well for me; carrots & broccoli inside a cheesy pizza. The pizza's are portioned generously, so if you're one person just go with the individual. There's also arcade games towards the back of the pizza restaurant. Pizza Port reminds me of an adult Shakey's. I will definitely come back but order the pizza I want regardless of who in the group gets it.</text>

Don’t be fooled by the name, Pizza Port is a great pizza place as well, but even if they didn’t have pizza at all, they would be a pretty great bar and brewery. The outside patio section under some palm trees is awesome on nice days. The inside is huge with lots of long tables and great for big gatherings or small get togethers alike. The beer menu is huge as the Pizza Port brewing empire has several facilities. There are probably close to 3 dozen beers on tap across the range from blonde ales to porters. There are of course multiple hop forward IPAs that go great on a hot day. Even the malty wheat and ales are pretty delicious. The inside is a good place to catch sports as well with many TVs. The pizza isn’t bad either. This is your place to go to grab a pint after some time in the sun on the beach for sure.</Text>

All pizza ports are rad! The pizza goes like this. Nice thick crust that is always cooked all the way through. Dankest toppings and specialty pies. They also have these things called Beer buddies, try them, they will change your life with their garlicy dankness. Insane beer as usual. Same crappy rude service though but that doesn't seem to stop me from coming back time after time. Dont think it stops many people...<//text>

I love the individual size pizzas, especially the garlic lover's one with wheat dough crust. Tastes wonderful and I dont feel guilty after I here! Only feel guily if i indulge in too many good beers and my buddies have to carry me out while i'm singing and laughing!!! ha ha fun place though really!<//text>

The food and beer may or may not be good, I was refused alcohol for having an out of state license so I left. The guy at the counter said "it could be fake, I don't know what Utah licenses look like." no joke. So steer clear if your from out of state.</Text>

< review>
This is the quintessential surfer/craft beer hangout.  I think I literally saw Jeff Spicoli (if you're not old enough to know who that is, forget it).

On a serious note, the only thing that is not awesome about this place is the parking situation, but then again what can you expect in OB and thank the flying spaghetti monster that there are no soul sucking multi-story parking garages ruining the vibe that is OB.

I haven't been to the other Pizza Ports yet, but this one was fantastic albeit packed to the gills.  As you probably already know there is a plethora of home brewed craft beers, as well as plenty of guest taps.  Heavy on the D/I/PAs, in fact when I was there I think they had 7 IPAs and  3 or 4 DIPAs.  The beer line and the pizza line are separate and there are virtually no vegetarian pizza options, unless you roll your own (which you can if you want).

If I lived in OB (I'm not sure how this is possible anymore with real estate prices the way they are) I'd be there several times a week.< /review>

<Text>I can't particularly say I LOVE their pizza but it's ok.  Their atmosphere is great and their beer even better. They brew their own beer and dozens of types!  All SUPER SUPER awesome!  It's a place for craft beer aficionados!  Their staff is always happy to be there and happy to serve you and I very rarely can complain about them.  The pizza is ok, they have great specialty ingredients and the larger the pizza the better the crust I think.  Don't get a small if you don't like a lot of dough more like a hand tossed pan pizza.  The large is good and the lunch slices even better!  In fact they have the best lunch deal in town!  An amazing garden salad that me and my bf share and HUGE slices of pizza and soda for 5$ and if you want a beer its a 1$ more for regular beer and 2$ for stronger beers.  They always have a unique slice of the day accompanied with the choice also of pepperoni or cheese everyday and the slice with the salad is perfect!  I ate this almost daily when I worked across the street!  They are fast and the lunch is good and soooooo cheap!! They also have great salads!  The port salad is one of my favs!  It's all veggies and has so much in it that is unique you'll never miss the meat!  Roasted red peppers, blue cheese, spring mix, marinated portobellos and more!  It's to die for!!!< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>We came here to hang out with friends, and this was a perfect spot. Great food, great beer selections, and great company!

We came here on a Sunday night, a night before Memorial day. It's been awhile, and I completely forgot how crazy busy it is in these Ocean Beach streets. We got luckily how easily we found a table fit for 8 people.  The place is always packed and  loud, however people are quite polite and respectful.

We tried out the honey beers, Carlsbad pizza, cajun bites, garlic bites and chicken wings.  The honey beers were a treat for me. I'm not much of a beer drinker, but the Honey beer is something I would keep ordering. It's light, tart, and a hint of honey for the after taste.  The carlsbad pizza intrigued me --with the mix of artichoke hearts, feta cheese, alfredo sauce and peppers. The pizza was a tasty creation. The saltiness and sweetness flavors worked well with the ingredients. Though, the chicken wings didn't impress me much. It was average. The cajun & garlic bites were ok. They were made in a pizza bread, and then cut into pieces, cajun ---with jalapenos & garlic -- stating the obvious, and put into a basket to share.

Whenever I'm in Ocean Beach, I'd be back here for the assortment of beers and pizza selections!<//Text>< Pictures>

Great pizza and salad, set up very authentic, very asked, so it's hard to find a place to sit and it takes a while to get your food, but it's worth it and you can spend the time watching different sports on the TVs all over the walls<//Review>

The beer is plentiful (lots of different beers and always fresh) they pour a lot of beer so no stale surprises.and the prices are very fare, pizza was quite good but expensive and the seating and noise left little to be desired, but I do recommend.< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I asked for only $ 20. The reason for the cheapness is that every Wednesday it's 45 cents a wing and a cheese stick. It's 45 cents from 5:00 until closing, so please try it. The wings are hard for small children, so it is better to try one wing first. I recommend flight beer rather than glass.

(Original)
これだけ頼んで20ドルです。安さの理由は、毎週水曜日は、ウイングとチーズスティックガ45セントだからです。5時から閉店まで45セントなので是非お試しください。ウイングは、小さお子様には、辛いと思いますので先ず1つ試食させた方が良いと思います。ビールは、グラスよりもフライトを僕は、オススメします。< /Text><time>1576250903450</time>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) The pizzas and the super excellent beers! We ordered wings but they are not nothing special although they are baked not fried. A lot of beer to choose from and several screens with sports. Beware, beer is ordered and collected individually by person with identification in hand. There are no waiters.

(Original)
Las pizzas y las cervezas super excelentes! Pedimos alitas pero no son nada del otro mundo aunque son horneadas no fritas. Muchisima variedad de cerveza para escoger y varias pantallas con deportes. Ojo, la cerveza se ordena y recoge individual por persona con identificación en mano. No hay meseros.< /Text>
