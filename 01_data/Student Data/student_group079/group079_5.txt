<username>Simon Makota</username><Review>BEWARE  DO NOT USE THIS  PLACE.....
So my partner  accidentally booked this place. we only saw, the review's  after...  stories of bed bugs, cockroaches, Unsecure  rooms and people living on-site  as  permanent residents  were plentiful. we thought  we would still give it a chance. Upon arriving  the town seemed pretty desolate, isolated and forgotten. felt like being in a time warp. However It had a certain charm.

All seemed well that's until we noticed  no additional latch or secondary  lock on the door. The window in the bath room was unsecure and faced a liquor store that was open most of the night.we had to improvise  further security measures. But even after  all that   we still gave it a chance.

But late at night, as we tried to sleep we noticed...  bed bugs on the  mattress and inaddition  my partner  found cockroaches  in the  bathroom crawling all over our toothbrushes 😡.It  being midnight we decided to sleep  in our  car rental.  How are places like these still  allowed to do business  on booking...?? poor tourist  being subjected to  third world like treatment. I never had this issue in india. Shame  on you booking.</Review><gmapID>0x80ce2371b9d6a98f:0x51ecbd7753d0db5e<//gmapID></record>

No heat, AC. hot water hit and miss. Mostly none. Bugs, Bugs, Bugs. Loud music with heavy bass 24/7
Original carpet. Musty smelling room. Roof leaks like a sift. This motel or whatever it is, should be demolished. A real dive.</Text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Room was dirty.  No pen & paper.  No instructions, rules or info about motel or surrounding area.  Office locked with written instructions on door telling how many times to ring the doorbell, depending on why you are there.  Greeted with an angry manager, yelling at me because I didn't wait long enough for him, before I began to walk away.  I had prepaid reservations or I would have kept on walking.  I relunctantly went back to the office to ask for a receipt, internet password and cleaning product.  I was greeted again by the angry manager that provided me with the password and a hand written receipt from a generic receipt book, without the motel name or info.  I was not surprised when he told me he had no cleaning products and no pen that I could use in my room.  I can't be sure, but I think most of the odd characters around there were living there.  There's plenty more I could complain about, but this should give one a good idea of my experience.  Maybe because it was one of those last minute deals.  I would not recommend this place.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

My eyes got weary and my head went light on the way to "Hotel California" and I had to find a place to stay.
Clean, comfortable and convenient describes this place. I met the coolest guy on the whole trip "I assume Tom by reading the reviews". Took my wife and infant in for the night rested up and kept a good memorable experience. Thanks guys, manager, cleaning staff and the pple staying there.
I couldn't have made it another minute on the road 5hat night and I called in, no rez and the guy put us up without the nickel and dime.
This was the only non corporate hotel on the whole trip from Cleveland to Bakersfield and I would choose it anytime for the next run!!!

Thanks guys EXCELLENT SERVICE!<//Text>

One u have to read hand written instruction for u to ring the bell of front office during the day. Then there is no inside lock on door.   Then after leaving air on for 4hrs the room was still hot and the manger  told me we could ck out tomm morning. The pool had no water in it and the worst there was mouse dropping on the floor in room where the mamger said it was bugs but they didnt move.  We ck out after 4hrs. Needs to be shut down. Older lady seen us with kids and ask if we had any weed. Not a place to stay unless u homeless</review>

More of a halfway house than a hotel. Rundown hotel in a depressing shell of a town that might have been many many years ago. Bed has to be at least 30 years old. Original carpeting (not a good thing) and unintended vintage tangerine colored bathtub. I slept with only a sheet and upon close investigation did not find any evidence of bedbugs. The comforter automatically goes on the floor. Wore shoes to bathroom. Did not use towels. Just ick all around. This motel has to be removed from listings. It seems to be a home for down on their luck locals and appears to be rented out by the hour.< /Text>

When I walked in there was fried chicken skin on my bed, no pillow cases on the pillow. Smelt like cigarettes. Worst hotel ever, not to mention the people from "hills have eyes" people running it.</text>

<text>I will never stay here again! The outside looks like a crackhead hotel. There is a pool with no water with a broken run downed fence. I opened the door to see an ok furnished room, but as I looked down a cocaroch ran passed me. The bathroom wasn't cleaned well, and there was old coffee still inside the maker. Grosss!!! I know this city isn't great or attractive at all, but when you have out of towners come at least have you're motels in decent shape, people dont stay here!< /text>< time>

< review>
(Translated by Google) we stayed here one night having made the stop from Los Angeles to the Grand Canyon. It's a cheap motel, it had all the features we were looking for, parking in front of the room, I could see the car from the window, clean, comfortable bed. Rarity for the area, the wooden palquet instead of the mouquet. Kit for making coffee and tea. Great

E' un motel economico , aveva tutte le caratteristiche che cercavamo, posteggio di fronte alla camera, potevo vedere l'auto dalla finestra, pulito, letto stra-comodo.

(Translated by Google) Terrible receptionist management.
We were attended by a man connected to an oxygen machine, without any education. He gave us two keys to different rooms both occupied. Imagine the surprise. The third key did not open the door. He did not apologize at any time.
The room was clean the part that looked but under the beds there was a lot of dirt.
The tub had live bugs.
The air conditioning a scandalous noise.
The mattress was stained like rust.
I am surprised that booking allows advertising to this type of establishments ....

(Original)
Pésima gestión de recepcionista.
Nos atendió un señor conectado a una máquina de oxígeno, sin ninguna educación. Nos dio dos llaves de habitaciones diferentes ambas ocupadas. Imaginen la sorpresa. La tercera llave no abría la puerta. No se disculpó en ningún momento.
La habitación estaba limpia la parte que se veía pero debajo de la camas había mucha suciedad.
La bañera tenía bichos vivos.
El aire acondicionado un ruido escandaloso.
El colchón estaba manchado como de óxido.
Me sorprende que booking permita anunciarse a este tipo de establecimientos....<//text>

Beer conveniently available inside to accommodate the lowlife grab-and-dashers.  Sales clerks in the store are guaranteed RUDE.  Nonservixe dogs come in with wayfaring owners and management doesn't even care!  If you ask a clerk for help, the act like they are doing you a HUGE favor. The pharmacy on the other end of this "oasis," ha!  SAME AFFECT.  It is painful because I live here to have to go in both placez, but they have a corner on the market.

Really beautiful place. Lots of neat souvenirs and niche shops around. Make sure to support the local small businesses when you visit, they need support and are well worth it.< /review>

Not happy with maps on my new phone.  It took me miles away going to a appointment.  Monday I was going to another appointment and the map was going downward instead of up so I could read it.  40 minutes late, I had to call for directions!!  I have only used it twice because this was first time at both locations.  I will practice on this phone but I was much happier with my old note 4.  I have a note 9!< /text>

<Review>The staff here is really nice and friendly, they are so helpful with any concerns or questions that arise, the assistant manager ed  is very knowledgeable of what he sells and how the devices work, I can tell the staff depend on him with many issues that arise when I was there for a bill payment many of the staff would call him or ask him for help for questions or device issues, and he was right there ready to answer any questions or concerns, and when he helped me he was very helpful and friendly with any questions or concern I had he had the answer to it right away with no hesitation, but I'm sure he's gotten the same question before!

Will come back for their expert service and friendly service!< /Review><user_name>Cassandra Cale< /user_name><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Rating>

Horrible serviice! Went to store to upgrade my phones. Was only notified of half of the fees they were charging me until i began asking questions. By the time I was advised of the "hidden fees" Aaron had already taken the screen protector from my current phone. I cancelled the purchased and left the store without having my screensaver replaced. Horrible experience!</Text>

< Review>
I went into a T-mobile retail store #2807 at 1313 w. 17th St Santa Ana, CA. I was helped by Bianca! She said let me see if you qualify for our services! I gave her my social security number! I didn't want to make the switch from Verizon to T-mobile! So I left the store! Bianca opened up 3 cell phone lines under my social security number and then cancelled them! I've received a bill for $133 and now a 2nd bill for $14! I didn't get much help from calling customer service! T-mobile hasn't done anything to help me! If this is how T-mobile trains their employees, I want nothing to do with T-mobile! Don't ever give your social security number to T-mobile! I thought T-mobile would do something to help me, but they don't care! Does that employee get more of a bonus for opening 3 cell phone lines? This is a bad way to try and get customers T-mobile! If Bianca didn't set up this fraudulent account, I probably would have switched to T-mobile!< /Review>

I came in to the store to get a phone replacement because my phone is no longer charging anyways the guy who helped me out is an ASS! He supposedly placed the order in for a replacement which I should have received this past Monday or Tuesday.  Wednesday came along and my phone wasn't here yet. So I decided to call tmobile at 611, the person who I spoke over the phone said that IDIOT never submitted and order. Do not go to this location! The staff is made up of incompetent asses!</text>

I had a bad experience at this location. Went in to get the BOGO for the edge 7, buy one get one. Should have received my  visa card with the full value of one of the phones in May. Never did! Jose was my seller, he sold both phones under different contracts, therefore I didn't qualify for the promo. Instead of excepting his error n fixing it. Him n his manager J or Jay ignored my complaint. They thought I was gonna forget abt $700! like  really! who will? They NEVER! return any of my calls, (like they said they would) with any intent of resolving his, their mistake. In the end I called corporate n they helped me with success! Always call corporate.<//text>

One of the worst T-Mobile center.  Please be careful when buying here because they will lie to you for sales.  It's the culture of the store instead of being an honest 3rd party dealer.  This store reminds me of the Wells Fargo opening multiple false accounts scandal or going to a car dealership.

I came in to buy the new Galaxy s7 edge with my girlfriend.  After grabbing the phone from the back, the associate that helped us started to tell us about the special deals that is "included in the price of the phone".  He showed us all the accessories that we can get and since they did not have screen protector and case in stock, he switched it out for a JBL Bluetooth speaker.  Throughout the whole process, I asked him multiple time is this going to cost any extra or is it free.  His answer was it is "included in the price of the phone".  We also wanted to pay off the phone right at the store but he insisted that in store you can only do EIP monthly payment plan.  THIS IS FALSE, YOU CAN PAY OFF ANY PHONES OR FEES ASSOCIATE WITH YOUR ACCOUNT IN STORE RIGHT AWAY.

We came home only to find out he put all the accessories item on T-Mobile EIP payment plans.  It appeared free because you pay 0 dollar upfront except for the tax but are still responsible for the full price monthly.  We came back to return the items right after finding out and even then a different associate that help us gave us an attitude and a rude look.  Not once did they offered an apology for lying to you.

My advice if you need to go to this T-Mobile store:

- TAKE NOTE OF TYPICAL SALES TACTICS. They will push and not clearly explain to you what is really going on with the transaction.  If you feel uncomfortable about the experience, decline and leave the store or call T-Mobile customer service right at the store and ask them about any questions that you have.

- READ EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU SIGN.  They purposely print your contract and receipt in small fine print by scaling 4 pages into one.  Other T-Mobile store either do 1 or 2 so it is readable.  The associate will then proceed to flip through everything and ask you to sign at the end.

- Go home and reread the contract again and check your account online to see if there is anything out of the ordinary.  There is a restocking fee for phones but all other items can be return for a full refund.</text>

<text>I came in for a cellspot wi-fi router. I have poor connection at home so this router will help me with my signal and allow me to use wi-fi calling.

Tony the manager refused to let me get one saying I didn't qualify for one. Their website clearly said I was eligible for one. He made one of the employees first say they didn't have anymore when they did.

Tony the manager came to interrupt screaming at me and my family that we don't qualify for one and they do have them. Someone was lying first saying they didn't then they did.

Tony then started saying I didn't qualify for it and that I didn't need it. He kept telling me the computer would say I didn't need it when I have 1 bar of signal at home. Apparently his magical computer knows what I need instead of me.

He refused to tell me so I called T-Mobile support on speaker. The nice lady helped me out telling me I was more than qualified for it and she apologized on speaker for Tony's actions. She waived the fee and mailed out the router I needed.

Do not come here until they fire tony. There was another old man getting abused by another rep trying to get a phone he didn't want.</text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Liars. I bought a note 8 and they tricked me into saying that I had a case and screen protector when the 2 were actually sold for almost $ 100. I was thinking of buying another cell but for lying I don't buy them from this store. Be careful to do the math on your calculator.

(Original)
Unos mentirosos. Compre un note 8 y me engañaron diciendo que benia con un case y protector de pantalla cuando en realidad eran vendidos los 2 por casi 100 dolares. Pensaba comprar otro cell pero por mentirme no les compro en este store. Tengan cuidado agan las cuentas en su calculadora.</text>

Sandwich was not bad BUT She doesn't allowed me to refill my Coke. She said "No refill at this time".  "What kind of time? When these rules have been changed?" I've paid for it a full price. These people so greedy that don't allow to fill a cup for thirsty customers. I've been eating at Subway "forever" but nobody and never verbally assault me like in this place. My advice don't go there. Save your money for a better place.<//review>

Went here the other day looking for a bite to eat and was overwhelmed by all the fancy burger choices that I just chose a plain cheeseburger. I mean if you are a burger joint, you've got to at least be able to make a good cheeseburger. (That's why i always get pad thai at a Thai restaurant) Anyhow the cheeseburger was pretty devastatingly good. Burger patty was cooked perfectly, medium rare and nice a juicy. PLenty of fresh lettuce, onions, and pickles included. The bun was nicely toasted giving it a slight crunch when biting into the burger.

Poor customer service. First the employee tried to rush my order and began assisting the next customer before I finished my order. After making additions to my order she sarcastically asked   "now is that all". Lastly she snached the cash out of my hand when I paid. It seemed like she was in a bad mood today. Felt uncomfortable and will not be visiting this location again!!< /Review>

I walked inside the Subway on Lomas Santa Fe Road and saw the place look empty except for an employee having a break at the bar stool.  I said hello to be friendly and waited patiently.  After five minutes, a man comes out that looks like the manager and I said hello.  He seemed to be on his way out.  A few seconds later two more girls come from the back of the room and one stopped to help me.  I greeted her with hello and how are you doing.  I ate the sandwich there an noticed that when customers enter the store a bell rings.  Also, the staff greeted the other customers and was at the counter.  Maybe, I came on a change of shifts about 3pm on a Saturday.</Text>

This is probably the best subway shop in the area for lunch. They are fast, even when the lines are long and make good sandwiches. The only reason for the loss of a star is no restroom nearby, not even in the plaza that it is in.<//Text>

This Subway is always reliable. Friendly service and a well made sandwich. Perfect for pre-work panic food</review>

< Review>
It was my first visit to Subway at 124 Loma Sante Fe, Ste.101. It was just a short walk from the Solana Beach Amtrack/Coaster and Breeze Transit Station.
This Subway Store is part of a small shopping complex however, it's easy to see from Old Highway 101, which parallels most of San Diego's  famed "North County" surfing beaches!
There were four of us in our party and we had just come from a day at the Del Mar Fair and we spotted the Subway from the train station's upper  street level.
What a neat looking little store. I hadn't been to any Subway Stores for over a year, as the food that I ordered at the last store in the inner city just didn't hit the spot.
This Subway was so cool; it was about 18:50 pm
and  we had their store all to ourselves. I ordered a 6" B.M.T. Sub and it 30 oz fountain coke; my
Italian B.M.T. was really awesome! I was really impressed, as I always watch how my sandwiches are made and I think that the guy who prepared it, added a couple extra pieces of ham to my sandwich. I also like them toasted, because it melts the cheese on my sub.
My friends ordered the Ft.Long Fave; a 12" ham sub, with chips and a couple of 30oz. fountain drinks too.
I'm primarily a vegetarian but, Subway touts it's sandwiches as healthy food and after our meal at
this Solana Beach Subway, I couldn't agree more!
Mine was simply delicious and I loved it; my friends felt the same way about their meals.
This Subway-it was early Sunday evening-was quite cozy.
The associates who worked there were most gracious and I honestly felt that they were there for us.
In fact, the whole senario is what had brought me back to Subway! If I owned a car, I'd surely be "a frequent flyer" and I drive all the way up to Solana  Beach, just there!
I don't care what the Subway commercials say and eventhough they are a "chain store,"
my customer service experiences aren't always the same, just because the store name is the same.
Anyhow, whenever I crave a good healthy sub sandwich, I'll now keep Subway on my mind as healthy alternative.
Some food for thought: Many Californian's are really cheap tippers and you can take that anyway you please; most of the associates who work at these stores make only Federal Minimum Wage and in some states, it's as low as $8.50 an hour, while here in California, for most, it starts at $11 an hour and is going up about a dollar a year until it reaches $15.
San Diego's living costs are amongst the highest in the nation, which is something for you to think about next time you dine out...
And don't forget to eat at Subway!</Review>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>I ordered online 90 mns before they closed. I rushed down there an hour later to pick up my two orders, and saw a subway employee in his car, and the restaurant was locked up and closed. I received an email that stated due to foreseen errors, we had to cancel your order. We have refunded the money we charged your card. Well, thats all good and well, BUT. your hours state you are open till 10pm. I had a 930pm pick up time for my order. The employee that was sitting in his car was laughing and talking on his phone with the music playing.  He saw me and drove out of there in a hurry. The time was 9:40 pm.
I cant respect a business who lies about their hours and will not even provide a reason why THEY cancelled my pickup order.</review><Name>Jenny Markgraf< /Name>< GmapID>

<Review>I drove to the place to get a sandwich as I didn't get lunch. I arrived at 9:32pm, the sign OPEN was on, lights were on in the restaurant  but the door was locked... so please change the hours to CLOSE at 9pm instead of 10pm so we don't drive to the location. Obviously it is not the first time it happens...< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Great sushi bar. The master chef is very polite, but busy. I have to say not as big as you get in Hawaii, but fresh and very artful. It is in the crowne plaza hotel so use their parking. The Sake is a decent selection. Enjoy...<//Review>

<Text>I stay at this hotel several times a year for work, so I almost always make it a point to eat here. The sushi rolls are absolutely some of the most delicious rolls I have come across. Service is always friendly and the food comes out pretty quickly.

The only reason I give it less than five stars is due to the prices. Again, I travel for work so I get a budget for food, so I am less conservative about buying pricey rolls that are not super filling. I would not, however, buy these rolls on my own dime, since I would spend a lot to still be hungry. This rainbow roll pictured here was $17.< /Text><rating>4< /rating>< UserId.>

<Review>Killer spot for a light but filling meal. Everything is perfect. High quality fish, perfect sticky rice that's nice and warm wrapped in a crisp nori wrap. 100% amazing! Love the high top bar too. We managed to eat there even with a stroller. Best to do on off hours-- like 3pm on a weekday.</Review>< Response>

The best sushi I have ever had. I live an hour away but the drive is worth it every single time. The ambiance is modern, service is quick & friendly, and the quality of sushi here makes local sushi places pale in comparison. If I could, I would give Yokoso Sushi Bar100 stars.<//text>

<Review>Really like the sushi here. Freshly made in front of you. Came during a weekday for lunch and there was no wait. Highly recommend the toro, though they do have 4,5, and 6 piece combos which you can get to try an assortment of rolls. Service was good and the place has a good atmosphere. Usually a quick in and out, makes for a good place to grab a quick, tasty bite.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Second visit, we got the to-go $20 box. Delicious! I'll definitely be back to get the to-go box again, since it was so convenient and cheap. Love it!

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>This is definitely a great way to experience sushi. They make each hand roll right in front of you just before you eat it. The nori is still crisp, the rice still warm. The combination of temperatures, textures, and flavors of the ingredients add a whole new level to the sushi experience. The hand rolls are delivered one at a time to prevent any roll from getting soggy or otherwise not as literally straight-off-the-line as possible.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

We like a lot going out. Last night we came to this magnificent place which we didn’t know before. We had a delightful time there with exceptional dishes and a courteous team and a talented  cuisine. We put this place in our phone list  and we will definitely go again very soon.  Highly recommended.</Review>

It's my first time coming to Tomomi and I am a true lover of Japanese food!  The booths are quite comfortable and I felt very exclusive with my party of 9! Bring all of your friends!  bring your spouse!!  The lighting is dim and relaxing!  enjoy a drink with some sushi after a long days work! The staff are friendly and the food is excellent! I get the chicken Teriyaki bowl.  I don't live in Alhambra but I look forward to great times to come!!!<//review>

Food is good but also expensive.  Parking in the area is terrible.  Deducting 2 stars for their dumb parking policy.  They only validate if you take food to go.  So basically they don't give a damn if you eat there so DONT BOTHER EATING THERE.  If you want good rolls feel free to try the other 20 or so sushi restaurants nearby< /Text>

<text>This place is awesome!!! We stood in line for less than 20 mins although when we got in I could see that the line got a lot bigger. It is worth the wait. The service at the bar is designed to go super fast. I ordered the 6 hand roll special (only $23), toro, yellowtail, lobster, scallop were among the hand rolls. The scallop hand roll was amazing I ended up getting 2 more!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>It's coming from the Sugarfish people, so of course you can expect top notch handroll! I got the 5 handrolls set and a Sapporo light. Note that 16% gratuity is automatically added on, which is not much imo. I'm always amazed by how affordable this place (and Sugarfish) is. Of course the toro was heaven sent. The yellow tail and scallop were my second favorite. All in all this place is a must if you love handrolls and fish!<//Text><time>1596694584335< /time>< userid>

Our family of four stopped by for some sushi rolls and loved everything we ordered.  We had Diablo roll, Hawaiian roll, spicy tuna roll, dynamite roll, and some tuna sashimi.  They were all very yummy.  The tuna quality was outstanding...fresh.  We will definitely go back.  Service was friendly and excellent.  The price was very reasonable for the quality we had.  Loved it< /review>

Tomomi is a great place in the Alhambra area for good sushi, abundant food and great prices!  My wife and sister in law like this place already!  We ordered 2 bento boxes and a chirashi bowl.  Needless to say, the service here is also great!</text>

Sushi was really good, service was friendly and pretty fast. The sushi bar opens into the hotel lobby, so kind of an odd location. Prices are high but not insane... this is sushi in LA at a nice hotel.< /text>

<Text>It's in the front lobby of the hotel and connected to a bar which you can buy drinks from either place. Not much privacy because as you sit closer to the bar area its loud and if you sit close to the lobby there is traffic. So pick your poison. Greeted instantly and seated promptly after. Even got to pick my seat. Waitress was very pleasant so no complaints there. So now about the main course. Alright so...if you are afraid to spend money do not come here. The trend now with "foodies" is they want the food cheap and they want alot of it. I wanted sushi and the closest one to walking distance from my hotel happened to be this one. Yes I too was skeptical of the reviews but no pun intended went with my gut. Whenever I try a new sushi spot they have to have either 1. Omakase or 2. A Sashimi style with at least 5 varieties of fish. This is a baseline I use to decide if eating here is worth it or not. I expect no fishy smell or taste. I also expect the most basic of fish like salmon to be buttery and creamy. Your hotate better be extremely delicate and slightly sweet. Any bluefin tuna (the major three) should be prepped with extreme diligence. Now for me I have had sushi from Japan, Hawaii, other California spots, and to the midwest. Yes this place is on the pricier side and I believe it's mostly to do with being in a hotel so honestly for me it was not half bad as to what I paid for. So yes the Sashimi variety passed with flying colors. Now it was onto a roll. There are two things I care about when it comes to rolls is proportion and taste. If you have too much rice...over it. If the fried ebi is hot, cold, soggy, or hard as a rock in the roll...nope. if you top heavy it with fish...negative. Nothing should overpower each other. Yes the roll was $19 dollars but the sushi chef (pretty sure they have not earned Itamae status) hit both proportion and taste just right with the exception of getting a little crazy with the sauce on the plate...which is fine because it looks pretty and you can choose to apply more or less on your bite. Another pet peeve of mine is timing. With sushi timing matters alot because the Sashimi or sushi should be just below room temperature. If it's cold you know they do not know how to prepare the sushi or trying to mask the taste of the fish. Also the sushi chef should be mindful of when you order, finish, and when to give your next plate. If you wait too long its poor service or the sushi may get too warm. If you are not done and get served your next plate your sushi will sit longer than it should. In this case they served it with perfect timing. Once I was done with my Sashimi I was served the roll.  Does it have a michelin  star, no but as a hotel lobby sushi spot that is pretty darn good for me gets my five stars.<//Text>< pics>

Food, staff and atmosphere were great. However, this deceptive practice of adding a 4% surcharge to your guest's bill under the guise of employee wage increase is shameful. Yes, pay your employees a living wage, but also raise your menu prices so that the menu price reflects accuratelywhat guests will pay. Shame on you!< /text>

<review>Have gotten takeout here several times over the last few years, but don't think I’ll go back, unfortunately. The staff are friendly and efficient, but when a miscommunication (an “albacore special” is both an appetizer and a roll) resulted in something I really didn’t want, I returned and should have insisted on a credit, but as someone who hates to complain in a restaurant I agreed to have them remake the order, including the shrimp tempura that came drizzled in eel sauce - there was no proper tempura sauce. Should have used GrubHub and ordered from a better restaurant.

If you don’t like wasabi, when you order the nigiri, tell them to not include it. It is in the nigiris by default and it doesn’t say so on the menu. Ruined all of my good sushi because i don’t like wasabi.< /Review>

Eh.. If you're looking for good sushi go elsewhere. I was hesitant since its in the lobby of a hotel, but we were staying down the road so we tried it anyway. I should have listened to my feelings. The miso soup was not good and Tasted like old water with some seasoning. The red dragon roll was pretty good and would have been 3 star by itself. But the other sushi and soup was not as good.<//text>

Get a real Los Angeles experience.  Back of the building, down industrial looking steps, past the eerily lit janitor's closet. yeah, that's it. Yokoso Sushi Bar.  Not a sushi bar. Izakaya; and it is phenomenal.  Fabulous sake bar, listen to the wait staff's suggestions.  They know whereof they speak. Must haves: euro edamame, cod, fluke Boccaccio, beef ribs. Make sure your wallet is ready, player!< /text>

<Review>The staff was nice, was hoping it'd be decent considering it was japanese run but I was severely disappointed with the food. The rice was so overcooked and over marinated with sushi vinegar it overpowered the taste of the fish (practically couldn't taste the fish at all really). And then the price is also quite laughable.

$40 for a beer and a sushi combo, which I wouldn't have minded if the rice was prepped properly. The grade of the fish was okay at best, I feel like I've had better at Gatten which is kind of sad. Place has potential but it's not living up to it< /Review><username>BTak 17< /username><GmapID>0x80c2b6d46a0ac677:0x2fab81d6170967ff<//GmapID><rate>2<//rate><response>None<//response><time>1449545496249<//time>< Pics>

Ordered 3 rolls, they spaced out the delivery across 40 mins. It tasted fine, though portions were tiny considering how much they charged. they didnt have enough soy sauce bottles for all the spots so I had to borrow from another guy.<//text>

<text>For the price I expected something much nicer. I spent $27 on a sushi platter that came with a single roll and 7 pieces of sushi. Not bad for a nice sushi meal, right?

It came out and I was immediately unimpressed with the presentation. Very plain and boring.

The nigiri had wasabi hidden between the rice and fish. I didn't notice until I received the full effect of wasabi to the roof of my mouth. The tuna wasn't fresh. The cuts were hacked. I've made better sushi myself (which isn't saying much). I won't be eating here again.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b6d46a0ac677:0x2fab81d6170967ff< /Gmap_id></record>

Just went to an amazing chakra clearing with sound healing, guided meditation, essential oils and custom selected crystals. The shop is adorable and I always find the right gift or special treat for myself. Check it out, the girls are super nice and helpful!</Review>

I love this shop! The atmosphere is positive and welcoming.  Idk what else to say except if you need to Smudge a space go in. If you need things for your craft go in. I've not had any negative experiences there.  Don't think it's possible to enter a public place and feel calm, relaxed, welcome. To feel positive especially in 2020. Then go visit. Until then BB!</text>

My daughter was walking home on her own from work and sparked a convo w/ a man about her style and  wearing different shoes. He gifted her a crystal. Little did he know the daily struggles and strength this grl has due to her rare disability and currently recovering from her 26th surgery but I feel that’s what attracted this very moment to happen. It was meant to be. My daughter and my heart was touched by a kind spirit that acknowledge my angel will be forever cherished in our thoughts and ❤️. I’m greatful for oside and beautiful people that surround my daughter. To hear her tell me about this moment made my eyes tear up. Thank you mystery man.                            From a mother who just loves her daughter soo very much.<//text>

<Review>I'm so excited to have found this place! An extremely helpful proprietor with a good selection of crystals. Loose herbs which are hard to find and she said she's always adding to her collection. I will definitely be back. She also supports a lot of local artists which is awesome.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1572998537733, 'text': 'Thank you so much!! 💜'}</resp>< gmap_id>

Fair warning the second you step in you'll want to buy everything! 💛 Elise is so damn sweet, helpful, and knowledgable as well as her other employees of course. It's definitely on my top favorite crystal shops ✨<//review>

Wonderful place! The environment is very colorful and it has a nice aurora to it. There are some many items and gorgeous stones.

This shop is so beautiful! Crystals, gorgeous gifts, dream catchers, everything my gypsy heart swoons for. I love my meditation pillow that I got that's big enough to sit in lotus. Everything is carefully selected, and/or handmade/locally made. Elise and the women who create and offer their incredible gifts are so heartfelt and talented. This will definitely be a go to place for me and my friends!< /Text>

The atmosphere is amazing and calming all at the same time. Elise, the owner is very helping and is very sweet. I purchased a gorgeous dream catcher for my son who is due any day. All the ladies in the shop went out of their way to ensure I had the perfect piece. Will definitely be going back for more pieces and gifts.<//Review>

<Text>Strolling through Artist Alley admiring the painted walls and small shops I came upon the open doors of "Gypsy Soul Dreaming" very inviting.
They definitely carry many lovely things that bring out that Gypsy soul in me. The girls inside were very kind and I felt very welcome as i wandered around admiring some of the very unique & pretty necklaces. I ended up buying a couple of lovely little things, a herbal spoon & my Gemini stone. But I will be heading back soon to get the necklace I was so drawn to, I think its calling me! :-) Love this store.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I was in town visiting from Maryland and was out with my hosts sightseeing.Stumbled across this store. I was in heaven! I've only been meditating with crystals for several months and have a nice assortment. My selenite and rose quartz found me here. Owner is very friendly and knowledgeable. Also found Poison incense,  which smells heavenly! My host is allergic to scents and  I'm anxious to smell it once I return home!!< /Review>

Gypsy Soul Dreaming has it all! I continue to stop by for their great quality and value of stones. To top it off, I am really stoked on their scented Sage and Palo Santo; their Palo Santo has last me for 4 months and still has half of it, I tend to smudge quite often. I really enjoy this shop and I guarantee your spirt would too.  Give them a visit, the staff are always helpful and great!</review>

<Review>I LOVE THIS PLACE. Elies is amazing. The vibe in the shop is so welcoming and warm. She is super knowledgeable and friendly. I want to start getting into crystals and she was so helpful and non judgmental. Her shop is so cute and u dont feel overwhelmed as you walk in if u dont really know what u doing yet.I will most definitely be going back.<//Review>< pics>

I naturally gravitated to this store and found everything I had been looking for. The Owner Elise had Good energy and was very knowledable with anything I had a question about. Everything was Unique and Original I loved being in that space! Unfortunantely I’m from the Eastcoast but I was happy to know she has an online shop aswell. I will be ordering from Gypsy Soul Dreaming for all my essentials from now on. I highly reccommend going here if you want to bring more positivity back into your life, they got what you need! Have a blessed one.< /text>

Love this place! The clerks are very knowledgeable and helpful and pretty quick when checking people out. Not to forget there prices are competitive yet very low. A definite favorite.< /Text>

Without a doubt the best smoke shop in the 209! When I need something from the shop I come all the way from the westside to south 9th. Even if I'm just walking by I step in for the hell of it! The store owner is the most honest man you'd ever wanna meet!! 10 stars and more to CITY SMOKE!!!!!</Review>

All of the employees are so knowledgeable and very friendly. I like to stop in even if I don’t have a planned purchase. I do wish parking was better so the businesses around them would not be so jealous of all the customers they get. Great place with great people and quality products.</review>

Hands down the best smoke shop in Modesto. Fiiiire deals on quality apparel, smoking related products, vape supplies, etc. That combined with the excellent customer service and a genuine care for the community makes this shop my preferred choice. You can tell immediately the store owner is honest with how he does business - something you can't find very often these days. While all stores work towards making a profit - very few care about what they provide to the community. This smoke shop is not only one of those select few, but without a doubt the best in the city.

Would give it 10 stars if I could.<//text>

They are always wonderful. Instead of going to smoke shop closer to home I get on bus/ car and go the distance. Good people</Review>

Not sure about the below comments.   Doesn't seem to care if customers can get into the limited parking.   Looks like a side business going on in the cars out front!   Trunks open,. Looking over the shoulder.    Ya know.      SHADY to say the least.   Well ya can't make rent if no one can park and spend $$.   But hey seems like a cool.place to hang.<//text>

Originally gave them one star due to my gel nails falling off within two hours ... but they went above and beyond to make sure I was happy again and basically gave me a redo for next time :) incredibly happier now with them<//Text>

I have visited Marlowe twice now and had a great experience both times! They've implemented new COVID protocols (temp check, questions at the door, etc.) and put in plastic partitions at the manicure stations, so I felt perfectly safe going in for both a mani and pedi. I first got the Marlowe Mani and had Aiden as my nail technician. He was really great! I'm really pleased with how my nails turned out (smooth, shiny with beautiful shaping and cuticle work!).

The interior of the salon is super chic and clean. The staff were all incredibly friendly and attentive. I didn't have to wait to get started upon arrival. I also really appreciate the ethical practices of this business. A living wage is SO essential, and the quality of the service matches the price in my opinion.

I got my first Marlowe Pedi today. It was divine! I had Thi as my technician. She was wonderful. She really took the time to attend to the little details. My feet were a mess before a went in since I'm a dancer: lots of dead skin and calluses. She was both gentle and thorough as she attended to the bottoms of my feet, cuticles and areas around the nails. My feet look and feel great now! She even put my flip flops back on my feet for me when it was time to check out so that I wouldn't accidentally mess up my toenails. So sweet! I'd highly recommend Marlowe if you're looking for some high quality pampering.< /review>

Overall good, with a great business model that makes the cost of the pedicure worth it.  Fair wages and working conditions.</Review><Response>None<//Response>< Rate>

My friend and I had a really great experience at Marlowe!  We did a gel manicure with complex nail art on two nails.  Miriam worked off a picture we brought in and exceeded our expectations for our sharks.

The picture was taken 11 days after our manicure and still looks as good as the day it was done, minus the growing part.  Definitely would come back again!</text>

It is very clean and all the employees were friendly.  I love my carefully manicured nails.  My technician took her time and paid close attention to the details, making sure to keep the brush going in the same vertical stokes with the metallic color I chose and the top coat.  I have never seen someone take that much care in making sure my nails looked perfect.  My only complaint is that there were no drying machines.  A very minor thing in the overall experience.  I definitely recommend this place.</text></record></dataset><record>

The Marlowe team always takes such good care of me. Excellent customer service, top-notch technicians, and a clean & safe environment make Marlowe a stand-out among nail salons. It also makes me feel good that they are paying their employees well. I'm so happy to support Marlowe!< /review>

<text>Super cute little nail salon but more importantly, clean! Lots of nail colors to choose from including non toxic options, which I love! My pedicure was very nicely done and involved a great massage, which is sometimes skimped in other salons. I’m new to the area but I think I found my go to nail place!

Marlowe never disappoints! Their salon is so cute and their staff has very keen eyes for detail and precision. Elle was very gentle on my feet and hands (other salons tend to cause bleeding when removing cuticle). On top of great customer service, I learned Marlowe was a fair labor company that prides itself on giving their employees benefits such as 401k and health insurance. Definitely will return.<//Text>

<Text>I have been going to Marlowe for the last 6 months or so and I've never looked back. They provide the best service — very friendly, always professional, incredibly clean, and have such impeccable technicians. Their pricing is higher than your usual nail salon, but the quality is unbeatable and they pay fair living wage and provide benefits to their employees (yes!). So glad you opened up in Berkeley!< /Text>< rating>

<text>I’m so grateful that Marlowe exists... it’s nearly impossible to find a clean and hygienic nail salon (most ppl don’t even know what to look for, sadly) and Marlowe fits the bill. No corners are cut and the quality is high. I’m also glad that Marlowe doesn’t over book itself, offers beverages, and is a relaxing (not stressful/chaotic experience).</text><Resp>None< /Resp>< rate>

I've become a regular here for almost a year and I've always received great service! I usually just get the Marlowe pedi. Their facilities are clean and staff are very friendly. I've had different staff perform my pedicures and they're pretty consistent, which is nice. And you can earn a free manicure after 10 salon services! :)</Text>

<Review>They give the best pedicures and manicures.  They take the time to take care of and listen to you.  This is my go to for pedicures.  It's not your run of the mill Nail Salon in that they don't take walk ins and if you have an appointment they take you on time and aren't rushing you out to take care of someone else.  You get what you pay for and I appreciate the good service.</Review>< pics>

<Review>I had a great experience at Marlowe. I had scheduled the first appointment of the day and when I arrived I was taken right in and offered a drink and given a chance to look at colors for a gel polish. After choosing my color the nail tech got to work. I was impressed with her attention to detail (her name was Ahn, I believe), she even took the time to fix a nail that I wouldn’t have even noticed wasn’t perfect, but she did. When I left my nails looked great and I scheduled a follow-up appointment. My appointment was about a week and a half ago and my nails still look great!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80857edcd0e92fbb:0x3d8af61132864ac4<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I absolutely love this nail salon!! I have rebooked after each appointment because I have loved my experience so much. The salon is really well decorated. They have both trashy magazines and news magazines. Nice staff and great color selection.  Check it out!!< /text>

<review>So expensive, not worth the money for the quality of the pedicure. It was nice to be offered water, but I noticed other customers were offered wine (?) and were receiving assistance in picking out a color. None of this was offered to me. My pedicurist used the flimsiest cheap nail file I’ve ever seen and cut a corner off one of my toenails which then made them uneven. She also used said nail file to remove my foot calluses...which is definitely not proper technique. I am upset that I paid $45 for one of the worst pedicures ever. To top it all off, the nail polish smudged after I sat for 15 minutes waiting for it to dry.< /review><gmapID>0x80857edcd0e92fbb:0x3d8af61132864ac4</gmapID><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

Clean and beautiful looking nail salon. They keep it simple and clean here. It's comforting to see a package of clean tools being opened before you. One of my biggest fears is a fungal infection from going to a salon so I've painted my own nails for many years. My partner booked me a manicure here for a special occasion. I brought my own nail color here, which is ZOYA brand and they have the basecoat and topcoat to match. They have a lot of ZOYA and OPI from what I can remember.

The staff is very friendly, welcoming. The place doesn't smell crazy like most nail salons since this place doesn't do acrylic or other heavier chemical processes. They don't have too many stations so I was asked to sit at the waiting area while my nails dried, which was fine. I think the music playing can get a bit overwhelming because it's high energy, but that's just me, I'm a quiet introverted person.

They have drying drops at the very end, which I've never used before. I was told to wait at least 1 hour for my manicure to dry before doing anything more intensive with my hands.

The person who worked on my nails was pretty quiet, but did a good job. I think I am just not used to my cuticles being cleaned up and pushed back so that is always a sensitive process for me. I did notice they felt dry the days afterwards, and a pit peely, so moisturizing the following days was a must.

I think the only criticism isn't heavy, but I do think I could have done a better job at the actual nail painting portion. There was some pooling at the cuticles. I thought at least a brush with acetone could be used to clean up the cuticles for a clean line, but maybe it has something to do with using new tools every time, so that's ok. I understand the nail professional needs to get through each client efficiently so they don't have all day to paint perfectly.

Overall a good experience. :)<//Review>

<Text>This first-timer just became a regular! The place was pristine and you can tell everything is clean and sanitized. Kate did my mani pedi and she was seriously amazing. My toes are beautiful! And when I told her I chew my nails but want to grow them out she too the time to do a few extra layers with the gel, which you know takes time. And not a single spot on cuticles bled or was even sore. Love this place and am already booked for the California Mani and Pedi next month! :D</Text>< Pictures>

Beautiful and clean salon. The products used are mostly organic and smell wonderful (some nail polishes aren't organic but the lotions and scrubs they use for mani / pedis are). I can't recommend this place enough. And the staff is very friendly and informative about products used.<//text>

Their pictures of their salon may be cute but I absolutely do not recommend booking here.

I called to make my wedding nail appointments here for myself, my mother and maid of honor. I spent over 30 minutes on the phone with their receptionist to book 3 simple appointments and they said they'd give me a call right back but instead, it took them over a day to call me back. Once I was called back, I was put on an 11 minute hold but wanted to be patient, as it was important to me to book with, what seemed, like a lovely place for me to get my nails done for my wedding.

When I finally did get a call back, I ended up booking my appointments. I was SO excited and incredibly relieved I found (what looked like) a beautiful place to get my wedding nails done. As expected, they took my credit card number down to hold the appointment.

Later on in the afternoon, I went to make a huge purchase for my wedding and embarrassingly, my card was declined because Marlowe had charged me over $100.00 without my permission. After calling them, they said they had no record of the transaction and weren't willing to do any research on their end. When I got my bank on the line to try to the remedy the situation, Rebecca (I'm assuming the manager at Marlowe) rudely hung up on both my bank and I. The representative at the bank was even shocked she would hang up on us like that.

Can't say if they do great nails or not but I surely can say they are way overpriced (which was going to be fine for my special day) for the terrible treatment I received from their management. Oh, and the fact they basically stole over $100.00 out of my bank account when I trusted them with my debit card number.

My Friday afternoon went from being exciting and leaving me feeling relieved about crossing something off of my very long wedding to do list to instead spending the afternoon on the phone with the bank and an incredibly rude woman.

Be wary when giving Marlowe any of your credit card numbers!< /text>

It’s a lovely location for a girls day or just by yourself to feel pampered in this beautifully designed location. The cute leather chairs support your back nicely while you soak for your pedicure. There are no massage chairs, which I would have thought they had, but some people don’t like them anyway.
There are no smells of polishes and acrylic that waft in the air. The staff was friendly and accommodating in every way offering water, tea or Proseco.
I’m glad the salon has a description about their staff compensation. They have employees that have 401k’s and health benefits. That makes sense and justifies the higher amount for services. Just like Warby Parker donates a pair of glasses for each pair you buy, you can be confident knowing you supported a salon staff member paying a little more than a regular nail shop price.  I felt very pampered.</Text>

Very disappointing experience. I have been looking for a nail salon like this in the East Bay for awhile and had high hopes for this new space. The salon is aesthetically beautiful and they did offer beverages when we arrived, but that is where the positives stop.

I had scheduled a mani/pedi combo for both me and my mother the day before we were flying out on our trip. I made the reservation the day prior IN person and initially, the receptionist seemed friendly/accommodating. She said she was able to get us in together for a manicure but our pedicures would be staggered, one after the other. I handed over my credit card and reserved our appointments.

We arrived to the appointment and told the receptionist that we were there for a mani/pedi. As we were picking out our colors she informs me that we are only booked for manicures, in an accusatory tone. I told her no, I most certainly booked both and we had had a discussion about how long the services would be with them staggered.

We are seated and the receptionist comes back over and says again that its not on the schedule and she isn't sure what happened, that it must have been booked on a different day, but they are fully booked and can only do our manicures. Meanwhile, she keeps going back to the front desk to speak to another woman with her back turned (the manager/owner) and relaying everything I am saying to her. This is only a few feet away, so I can hear everything. The owner/manager never once turned around to acknowledge me and never came over to apologize for their error. From what I could overhear, she had a very "oh well" attitude.

Our mani appt was at 2pm. Their best offer was to do a single pedicure at 6pm and acted as if they were bending over backwards for this to work. Mind you, there is only one other person in the salon, mid manicure when we had arrived. No - I have a baby and I can't wait around for four hours to get a pedicure, this was already an effort to get time away. I asked if I could just shorten my manicure and get a quick file/polish change on my toes. As a new mother herself (the owner was outside with her infant when we got there) this is something I would think would resonate with her.

I understand that mistakes happen. There are scheduling errors and they were fully booked on Saturday. I get that. However, I didn't appreciate being made to feel like this was my problem. There was no effort by the staff to apologize (genuinely), to make things right by owning their mistake and making a shortened appointment work or at least offer something for their shortcomings to say, "hey, we are sorry your experience wasn't as expected, we hope you give us another chance." As we were leaving the salon, the owner was outside fussing over the sandwich board sign and never once looked up and said anything.

I am stunned by how terrible their customer service was.

During our manicure, we also overheard the receptionist and owner again whispering back and forth in a negative/inappropriate way about one of staff members who was black. The tone in which we witnessed them speaking to her was awkward and condescending.

To add insult to injury, my manicure was worse than at most random salons I've been to. The paint job was uneven and the top coat didn't fully cover all of the color with obvious brush stroke outlines. The paint also started chipping within 24hrs and by day 3 the polish looked pretty battered.

A beautiful space doesn't equate to a classy experience. Such a shame. I most certainly will not be back.<//Review>

So I've never gotten a pedicure ever in my life but my wedding day was approching (it was Friday and i booked my appointment the day before) so i thought why not do something special for my self after months of stress, and like anyone new to this i was a bit shy about someone touching my feet (lol). Staff was friendly and made me feel very comfortable and my pedicure turned from a nervous momment to a very pleasent pampering experience. I was so relaxed I almost fell asleep 😱😱❤ will definitely come back and recommend my friends.</text>< pictures>

It's always fast and the barista's are always friendly and helpful. I usually always get the Iced Carmel Macchiato Nonfat or the Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso which I've come to absolutely LOVE!</Text>

<text>Dr. Dave and the nurses are very nice and professional. They take great care making sure to keep you comfortable. I had five stitches on my hand and Dr. Dave did a great job. Thank you!

Went back for a follow up. Dr. Carrie was really nice and helpful. She provided excellent advice. The nurses here are nice and friendly.< /text><Response>None< /Response>< pics>

<review>Check in was a breeze since I’m a returning patient. The young lady at the front was very professional and polite. I was able to wait in my vehicle while they called me in. Once I was in the physician was able to exam me and went out of his way to make sure the imaging center he was going to refer me to was in my insurance network. He asked the receptionist to fax in the form and also give me a hard copy. The whole process from the moment I checked in took 1 1/2. Not bad for a Monday evening at an Urgent Care if you ask me. 10/10 recommend.</review><pics>None</pics><user_name>Cynthia Coronado< /user_name><GmapID>0x80dd292c1814695d:0x305d0243cb09c798</GmapID>< Rate>

<Date>1620186639101</Date><rate>1</rate><Text>I have a mask exemption. I walked in without one on. Was admitted and taken through all the steps and then spoken to by the front desk girl at least 3 times. Then after I was all signed in she suddenly tells me, me and my 5 year old HAVE to wear masks in order to go to the back. I said very politely "I can't wear masks I'm sorry". She then became aggressive and told me well sorry but we can't see you without a mask on. I said "I can't wear a mask". She said "okay why? ", I said that's private". Then said, "okay so you're telling me your office is refusing me service because I can't wear a mask?"  She said yes. I said is your office manager here and she said well we have a sign on the door saying it's required. I replied, still calm and polite, "I'm sorry but I still can not wear a mask I don't think you understand, it's not that I just don't want to,  I can not. She was at this point trying to intimidate me into wearing one and I said why don't you go to the back and ask before I walk out of here and call back to ask about this. She walked away with a bad attitude and didn't return. They called about 3 people in before me and left us waiting for a long time. Mind you it's an urgent care unit. My 5 year old daughter had a serious emergency.

They finally called us in. The doctor was to the point and seemed annoyed. I thanked her for seeing us.  She heard me out, did the exam then left. When I tried to go get water she loudly told me we have to stay in the room because of the other patients.

Over all... people need to understand that some people literally can not wear a mask and should not be harassed, intimidated or treated differently for this fact.  Just because we are gay I mean black I mean can't wear a mask.< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dd292c1814695d:0x305d0243cb09c798< /gmap_id></record>

The facility is clean and tidy.  The doctors and nurses are very friendly, gentle, and patient.

I went in first thing early on Sunday morning and I was able to be seen, treated, and on my way home in less than 30 mins. I didn't feel like the doctors or nurses rushed to get me in and out.  They are just that efficient.  They took the time to listen to my concerns and they even asked clarifying questions to make sure they got all the information and details they needed to accurately diagnosis and treat me.

I highly recommend Cypress Urgent Care facility.<//Text>

Fast service with friendly staff. 🙌🏽 I was in and out of there in 20 mins. I didn’t catch any names, but the receptionist, the nurse and the doctor were all very kind and respectful. I got the help I needed in a timely manner, couldn’t have had a more pleasant visit. 👌🏽</review>

Drove 20+ miles for urgent care need, and it was a great choice. Other urgent care facilities nearby were rude and seemed to careless, but nurses and doctors here are different. Despite how busy the are, they took time to listen and diagnose. I would definitely come back again. Very thankful for their attention and great customer service.<//review>

I just took my mother here on two occasions for symptoms of bronchitis. Both times, the NP told her that an xray was not necessary and that what she had was a virus. So she sent her home with an inhaler. Come to find out? My mother had pneumonia and influenza A&B. Now due to her age? These things can be fatal.

I used to like this place because it was quick and the staff were very friendly. However, thanks to COVID? The service quality has gone to s***. Please do not go here especially with an elderly loved one.</Review>

Nurse Olga was super kind, wonderfully patient, & completely attentive towards my elderly mom and compassionate towards her and her injured foot!! She was tender, yet efficient, when wrapping up her foot with an ace bandage like a true Pro!! Took her mere seconds!!
And Dr Devaraj was just as impressive....kind, compassionate, and thorough!! We never felt rushed or dismissed. And he was the one who called me the next day to confirm his original diagnosis of no break😍, once the radiologist gave him the report, after asking me to call in to get the results. Wow, do Doctors do that? This doctor did!!
Couldn't have been more impressed or more pleased with our visit to Cypress Urgent Care!! It is now our Urgent Care of choice, after going to several others in the immediate area. Love this place and you will too!!👍
Thanks for taking such great care of my most treasured family member!!💖<//review>

So I got a dog bite above my eye. They took me in right away!!! I was impressed with EVERYONE. From the person working the front desk,to the technicians,nurses and the PA Dustin. I am very very happy with my care. They are all friendly and welcoming. Last place I wanted to be at BUT the care was above and beyond<//review>

My Wife is a retired RN, Ph.D and I'm a retired DSD, & Paramedic from Los Alamitos AFRC for over 30 years of service.  This is truly the best Urgent Care Center that I have ever experienced.  The medical staff and MD go above and beyond the call of duty. I will never go anywhere else for my emergency medical care in the future.<//text>

All of the staff was curteous. The check-in and out process was swift and organized. Juan was our nurse/medical assistant he was very caring and careful with my 9 year old daughter who had an ankle injury. They have xrays in house which made it very convenient. The PA was very thorough at explaining and discussing her diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.
I would use this urgent care again. :)<//review>

Even though, I told them I was in a car accident, was limping and had a clearly broken finger, I waited over 2 hours in a hospital gown in a cold room while the female PA continued to take COVID related patients ahead of me. I could hear all of the visits as they were on speaker. Some people wanted COVID clearances for work while others wanted prescriptions for coughs. Yet, I sat shivering in pain. Even though I heard the medical assistant kindly remind her a car accident patient was in a room, she kept taking COVID related patients ahead of me. Ultimately, I got dressed and spoke with the receptionist to let her know I had not been seen. The receptionist stated that the PA had patients outside in an alley to see first. I left to seek other medical care. This disregard for patients without COVID concerns was disappointing. This is definitely not an urgent care you want to go to if you do not have COVID.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I have always enjoyed going there. The staff is friendly (which is a must for me). The set-up is very good, during this pandemic. I have been going to this Urgent Care, for almost 6 years.<//Review>

Cypress Urgent Care has a lot of amenities. Much better than going to a hospital emergency room. I’ve had X-rays, IV fluids, and stitches here.<//Review>

Thank you for figuring out what is wrong. I am so glad my Dr referred me to your Urgent Care.

Will see you in my future when urgent care is needed.

I will refer friends, family & flight attendant's to your.

Thank you

<rating>5</rating><text>I had a great experience here. Me and my dad went together for our colds. The front desk and nurses were very friendly and helpful. We were both seen by doctor Handel. He is an awesome doctor. He was very patient, a great listener, and wonderful at explaining.  I love how good he took care of my dad he had nurses flush out his ear, took chest x Ray's, and most importantly he gave prescriptions! Have you ever been to a doctors office and left with no prescription, and a list full of unanswered questions?!  Well at this location that wont be the case. I'm sure you will leave feeling taken care of. I will definitely come back to this location.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd292c1814695d:0x305d0243cb09c798</Gmap_id></record>

Cypress Urgent Care is a bit out of the way for me rite now. However, I take the long trip by bus there because the staff and doctors are so pleasant and polite. I receive a thorough examination and the diagnosis is explained in a way that is that I can understand. I a.m treated with the utmost respect which makes going to the doctors a pleasant experience rather than a stressful one. To the doctors and staff, thank you for the wonderful way you treat your patients. I will continue to keep coming back. Thank you.</review>

The entire staff are very friendly and caring.  I was in and out very quickly.  Everything is automated and quick. They send in the prescription directly to the pharmacy.  I am very happy this urgent care is so close to my house and is open 7 days a week.</text>

20 minute wait on a Sunday morning.  Everyone seemed genuinely interested in providing care.  The doctor was in a real "problem solving" state of mind.   There is a refreshingly helpful vibe here.<//review>

Very professional and caring doctors. Appointments are available to book online which has worked great for me and my son who has been seen more recently there.< /Text>

<Text>It's difficult to say anything bad of places that help you with your health issues.  One day after new years, many family primary care physicians on holiday.   This poor place was topped to max, even the very helpful receptionist was sick.  Doing her best to help the sick.    Because of these reasons I'm giving them 3 stars.< /Text></record>

<review>The doctors and nurses are very kind. They were very attentive and thorough. I was a walk-in and the wait was not long at all. The front desk staff were very nice and checking in was easy. If I ever need to go to Urgent Care again, I would definitely go to Cypress Urgent Care.</review>< pictures>

WORST urgent care experience ever. This place is poorly run. I WAITED just shy of FOUR HOURS to be seen. I literally waited two hours in the lobby and then another hour and fifty five minutes in the exam room. When I was in the exam room my throat was swabbed for strep and no one came back for almost two hours. NO COMMUNICATION from anyone. When I was finally seen by a physician, he offered no apology for such a long wait, proceeded to ask me a few questions and told me that I tested negative for strep. He said that he doubted I had mono but would test me anyway. The medical assistant came back to test me for mono and made a joke. How funny these people have time for jokes but no time to take ten seconds to communicate with people about what to expect. The physician then told me I tested negative for mono and that I have a respiratory infection. He didn't even use a stethoscope to check my lungs or anything. The only thing he did was check my ears and look at my throat. I would call this INSUFFICIENT QUALITY OF CARE. I waited almost FOUR HOURS for the physician to give me an INCOMPLETE EXAM. The people working here could use some help in regards of building compassion and communication to the patients they are supposed to be HELPING. The physician could have been more thorough and could of at least been empathetic about the EXCESSIVE wait I had to experience.
ALSO, while I was waiting in the lobby, I watched the front desk tell incoming patients the wait will be over three hours when they close in two hours. It seems like they were trying to deter patients from signing in. It's clear the ladies at the front desk don't now what's going on as I could over hear their conversation about whether a patient was present or not. They were also repeatedly trying to call patients back who have walked out and left long ago and do not know who is next on the list and which patients are still here.
In addition, this place was dirty. The lobby chairs were all sunken in and ripped and trash all over the dirty floor. It looked as if the floor hadn't been mopped in a week. There were also roach traps in the bathroom and trash all over the bathroom floor.
This place seems poorly run, understaffed and employs incompetent staff, and unsanitary to boot. I would not recommend and urge others to avoid!</Text>

Most of the people that I’ve encountered here have been friendly, but most of them don’t have much phone etiquette. They’re not as pleasant over the phone when you call in to ask a question. I also don’t appreciate the fact that when a prescription is put in that they don’t Look for a 24 hour pharmacy when you go to urgent care later in the evening. I’ve been waiting for my prescription for two hours to find out that they sent it to a pharmacy that closed before I even went to urgent care. Now I am scrambling to find a 24 hour pharmacy so I can get an inhaler that I desperately needed tonight. Other than that, the wait times aren’t usually that bad for this urgent care.<//text>

My son had a hard fall and his hand swelled up. I took him to cypress urgent care was they found that he fractured his hand. The X-ray technician was amazing. He splinted my sons hand and forearm. My insurance then sent us to an orthopedic in Anaheim (not associated with this urgent care) and they were horrible with the X-rays and splinting. I went back to cypress for them to correct the orthopedics poor work. When it comes to being sick or having a broken bone or whatever it may be, they are amazing.< /Text>

<username>lisa stevenson</username><Time>1580548901548</Time><Rating>1</Rating><review>I went to Cypress Urgent on Friday morning because I had a terrible cough and sore throat. My ears were popping and cold sweats. When I went to Cypress Urgent Care December 2017 I had the exact same symptoms. Friday Handel PA advised me that I had a upper respiratory injection. Same diagnosis as December 2017. However Handel advised that this time I would not be given any antibiotics because antibiotics are being over prescribed and we need to preserve for the next generation. When I questioned why I was treated with antibiotics before at Cypress Urgent he said I was given incorrect information before. Said he could give me a note to take off work. I left and went to see my PCP and sent the information to the CDC that Cypress Urgent care is preserving the world’s antibiotics supply.</review>< pics>

The front office statf was very pleasant, efficient and friendly.  I was checked in, and as my paperwork had been filled out online, I was next in line.  I was called backin a timely manner and Selena was quite professional in her actions.  The doctor examined, cleaned and dressed my wound, and gave me a prescription for antibiotics.  Selena gave me a tetnaus shot as it had been awhile since my last one and she was very gentle.  She was most helpful and funny.< /review>

<Text>Over all good experience. I love the online check in process, you have the online waiting list, tells you how many people are ahead of you so you don’t have to just sit in the lobby the whole time, but you just have to get in early, like most places the later you go in the longer you’ll likely have to wait. Not to mention Dr. Handley is hot lol<//Text>< Rate>

<Text>i don't want to give any star. I am strongly recommend NOT to go that Urgent care .because all the doctor are none knowledgeable and not take care at all. in fact, I had in-grow  toe nail  they don't even have a equipment and didn't give  me any treatment but they told me to come back and recheck up. That for what ? they any thinking about money beside all the reception counter ladies are very very rude because I told them to get my money back but they told me "I'll call police". That why if you go and see that Urgent care you will regret end up unsatisfying like me.So that it strongly my recommendation.</Text><date>1563077125948<//date><pictures>None</pictures>< rate>

<Text>I love this urgent care not only did they save my life back in 2017 but they have always helped me with everything from getting sick to getting injured. What I really like about this place is although I go alot they dont judge me for going so much and help me. Also, dr handle is a really good dr. Always listens to me and helps me out when I cant get in with my primary dr or even my dentist. I will be forever grateful and continue to give them service as well as recommend people to them.

Went in for flu symptoms without an appointment and was seen promptly, treated respectfully, and given appropriate care and prescriptions. The nurse practitioner who saw me was pleasant, personable, and competent. My normal provider, Optimum Care, wouldn't even offer an appointment for more than a week since they were "all booked up."</text>

I was referred to this urgent care because its within my insurance network. For a second, i was literally sad on hearing the name CYPRESS URGENT CARE. It's a terrible place to be trust me!!

Can you be more FAST, EFFICIENT AND KIND PLEASE? 3 years and still no improvement in service? Always slow, front desk staff is very rude. No courteous words (please, thank you). They literally talk as if they they are ordering you around. Service is SLOW. Doctors are unproffessional and rude.

I love MEDPOST Urgent care. I wish they are within my network. Referring me to this Cypress urgent care is like a death sentence. Oh my God!!! They are a total waste of money, time and effort.</Text>

<Review>Ive had to come here a few times and the staff has always been nice and the wait time isn't horribly long. You can even call ahead and they're polite enough to give you an estimated wait time if you ask. (Wait time as of then, of course it can change if more people show up before you get there)<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Had a tiny piece of clear glass in bottom of my foot. Doc and I agreed best chance was to put a small slice at the entry point and flush with water. No way to know if he got it out til later when anesthesia wore off.  Well, great job Doc, that very sharp, distinct pain is not there when I  walk or stand on that one foot.
My primary doctor with my insurance probably would've had to set me somewhere to get the same thing done in twice or three times the amount of time. Thanks again.<//review>< Pics>

While the doctor and others who saw me were very good, I wanted to mention that Brandy, with whom I spoke on the phone and in person, was exceptionally accommodating. In addition to being very warm and personable, she went out of her way to check a sheet for a physical by letting me email it in to her before coming, and when I arrived she made sure that I got what I needed. Overall, I received great care.< /review>

<text>I was very impress with the doctor and staff at this facility. I had a deep puncher wound  that needed to have glass removed and cleaned out. The staff was very professional and caring. This facility is better then some other places I have been  to. It is a real urgent care facilities rather than other places that are more of a doctors office then an urgent care.< /text></record></dataset><record>

We took our son here it was closest Urgent care.  He had dislocated elbow, and he was in a lot of pain

Kari Hail nurse practitioner at UC
looked at it, she manipulated my son's arm and told us that  everything is ok it's back on the place and said it'd feel better in 15 minutes. And just I case she wants Xray. So they xrayed it. Said they couldn't see any breaks although there was a section they couldn't see properly which so they took another Xray it didn't show any breaks eater....
After our and more she told us that everything is good and my son still has fear and doesn't want to move hand. I told her that I know my son and he still in pain and I know I'm his mom. So she told me that She's a "doctor" and knows better!!!

After my husband talked to her she agreed try manipulation again. After that she gave as prescription and sent us home with crying baby. And told us to come in the morning if he will be in pain.

So eventually we came home with the possibility it had been dislocated but put back in place.
Kari Hail told us that he's just being protective and would wake in the morning having totally forgotten about it and would be fine.

He isn't. He woke up crying at night a lot and he didn't use his arm in the morning didn't want anything...

We called Urgent Care to ask what time we can come back? And guess what?!
Receptionist Joey asked wait on the line  so he can ask. After that he told us that Kari Hail advises go to ER. That she did everything she could what was Nothing!!! She did really nothing accept torching my baby and spending our time, money and energy.

Ended up taking him to another place back and saw a The doctor that had been in the profession, he took one look at him, manipulated his arm 'pop' (we all heard it) back in and immediately he lifted his arm to touch  some medical stuff on the wall...

Check review! Ask friends where to go if any issue.
Be healthy!<//Review>< Pics>

I've had to go a couple times. For kidney issues. The wait time was not bad. I was actually able to leave and come back. They held my spot. Staff was friendly. Liked the doctor had to go back. Due to lack of giving pain meds. Other then that. Good place to go if you want to skip the ER</text>

<Text>I called this location before I came in to see how long the wait would be. The lady tells me 2 hours. I uber down there and when I go to check in she tells me that the Dr on Duty is leaving at 3pm, it's now noon, when I get there. She says I can check in but it's going to be at least 3 hours and I'll have to leave and recheck in for the other doctor. This place needs to get their act together and not waste people's time!</Text>< Pics>

<text>Great doctor, reasonable waiting time and... incompetent receptionist who charged me full cost instead of co-payment!! After that it took significant effort to explain where they made a mistake. Now I have to wait more than 2 months to get a refund. In my opinion such errors should be corrected in the matter of days, not months so I submitted complaint to state board and BBB. Hopefully the receptionist will find a much more suitable job for her such as cleaning service.<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I went here with my daughter for a sports physical. The price was very reasonable. We got right in. The waiting room felt clean and orderly. The doctor found that she needed glasses during the exam. Something that had been missed at other physicals at other places in the past. We were so thankful.< /Text>

This place is terrible.  All they did was say my son was fine then sent us home. Then I got a bill in the mail and they will not allow me to pay through my HSA. Forcing me to write a check because they will not return any of my calls, no matter how many messages I left on the phone # that says to leave a message and someone will get back to me. I needed to pay it via my CC/HSA. This place is absolutely terrible and I hope I never have to go there again.< /Review>

With urgent care, you never know if you'll wait 2 hours or 20 minutes, so don't judge it by the wait.  I was very happy with the staff.  Juan especially tried his best to meet a specific need I had, and went above the call of duty.  The doctor listened to my concerns, and gave me medication I needed.  They don't like to prescribe much or give refills, as they want you to go to your primary care physician which is reasonable (imagine and addict going to multiple urgent cares in one week).  Anyway, I was very pleased.  Thanks Juan!!<//text>

<Text>I came in at 10am on sunday, I signed in and waited an hour then the girl at the front told me about this call back system where they text you minutes  before your appointment to come back so you don't have to wait. So at 12 they text me to come back my appointment  time is 12:30. It's now almost 2:30 and I'm still waiting there only 6 people in front of me when I first came in so in 4 hours this office was only able to see 6 patients?  Wow. I should have left but I'm to sick to drive around to different  urgent cares. I will never come back here again.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

0 STAR!!!
Please do not go to Cypress Urgent Care!!! Both the Receptionist and the Physician's assistant/Nurse was  unprofessional!! Horrible!! Rude!! and a Bully!!! Please read our experience!!

We rushed our 6 year old daughter after she accidentally had a candy that had peanut in it! When we walked in, the receptionist was on the phone, and the physician’s assistant was watching a game in the lobby. We stood there for a while, but none of them acknowledged us! And when I told her excuse me can my daughter please see a doctor! She was rude and kept on saying give me a second, give me second. When I again told her that it might be an emergency she’s having trouble breathing. This is her exact response “if it is an emergency then go to the ER, this is an urgent care! When I’m done with my phone then you will still need to fill out paper works before your daughter can see a doctor!”
The physician’s assistant was a bully and seemed to get irritated that his game was interrupted. He stood up and started yelling at us, saying I bet your daughter is fine! Then he slammed the door on us and took my daughter’s O2 count just for a split second. Yet when the doctor finally saw my daughter she immediately asked him to give her an epipen shot and told us to rush to the emergency room where she can be monitored.
We felt helpless, and extremely frustrated.<//review>

I called them before going there because I live about 30 minutes away, but they were the only ones open till 10pm and my 7 year old had two fingers extremely swollen from a fall off of her bike and needed to see if they were broken. We got there at about 8 pm and were told that they closed at 8 but there hours said Sunday open till 10pm! I questioned the rude smart ass behind the counter and asked her why she didn't say that to me when I spoke to her before I drove 30 minutes to get there and she of course lied and said "you didn't talk to me" and she was the one who I spoke to on the phone!!!! I will never go there again and am looking into filing a complaint against them...very unprofessional, making their own hours when for some of us, Urgent care is our only option sometimes!! If you have to lie to the public than you are in the wrong profession...shame on you</text>

I took my daughter in because her ears were hurting so bad she couldn't eat or drink without pain.I was also seen because I was still having issues after treatment from my doctor.We were in there for about 3 plus hours the NP we saw barely examined us and wrote me a perscription for cough medicine I did not need. Gave my daughter a script for a medicine she was allergic to and didn't correct it until halfway through the next day. So she h as d to suffer with the ear pain until that next night.<//Review>

<rate>1</rate><text>Very disappointed in the service this urgent care gives. Scheduling an appointment when they know the doctor wasn't gonna be in. The the blonde heavy set receptionist very rude when asked about when the doctor will be in next. The whole time all waiting rooms are full while the whole staff is huddled around the desk making jokes and laughing and a could careless attitude towards patients. Its unfortunate that these people get to work with people in need.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><userid>113574632175389765833</userid><gmapID>0x80dd292c1814695d:0x305d0243cb09c798<//gmapID><response>None< /response><date>1530672521990<//date></record>

<UserId.>115135008659713920219<//UserId.><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Absurd wait time. Took about an hour and a half even though there was one other person in the waiting room when we got there. The waiting room was very dirty and had weird looking stains on the chairs. We specifically had to ask about the results of the strep test. We were required to fill out paperwork and then the nurse asked all the exact same questions as soon as we got to the exam room. They did not send the prescription themselves but gave us a paper prescription that we had to take to the pharmacy. Then the doctor didn't properly fill out the prescription so it took another absurd amount of time because the pharmacy had to keep calling them back to get the doctor's name. wouldnt go back< /Text></record></dataset><record>

This clinic is listed as a site that accepts Ambi, but when we got there this morning, the nurse rudely informed us that they have not taken Ambi for 5 months. Maybe update your clinics information and have yourself taken off as an Ambi friendly clinic then? We wasted our time, something that we can not get back, and quite frankly is money. My wife was on crutches with a serious injury. It is a chore for her to move around. We had to take a handy van to and from the site, for absolutely no reason. Complete waste of a morning. A little effort to update information impertinent to your clinic could have prevented this.< /Text>

<Text>Very bad experience. I went in on 03/04/2015 the staff was EXTREMELY rude and  unprofessional. After 2 weeks I received a bill in the mail for $28 even though I paid the full amount before I left and when I called to ask about this the lady that answered was rude and unprofessional after she transferred me without even telling me I was being transferred they waived the $28 charge. The funny part is that I live in cypress and I was discussing this with my neighbor and he had worse experience than mine about a year ago. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I was just there and although their hours on Saturday are until 10:00pm in their website, they told me they were closing at 8:00pm. Since it was 7:50pm, I could not be seen! Unbelievable!!!!<//Review>

<Review>Tried to take my son here last night at 9:30pm.  Drove to Cypress from F.V. because it was a supposed to be the only UC open until 10p.  NOT!  Doors locked, lights dimmed and nobody there.   Even says on the doors they are open until 10pm.   lame!

< review>
We had a patient treated at Cypress Urgent Care.  They were pleased overall.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The wait time was less than 15 mins. The Doctor was thorough and assessed B.C.'s condition within a few mins.  We would recommend Cypress Urgent Care.

<Review>Worst urgent care I have ever been to.I had typical symptoms of flu , but they never performed basic swab test that confirms influenza.With a really bad flu season going, it should probably be a normal protocol.The doctor visited me for less than 5 minutes and was In a great hurry to exit.Extremely rude , unfriendly staff.< /Review>< pics>

{'time': 1546273824756, 'text': "Hi Sam - We looked at our records and absolutely did not have a five hour wait at anytime over the last several weeks - if ever at this clinic.  Cypress' staff is certainly caring and extremely competent so I feel like perhaps you wrote this review in error?  Maybe you were seen at a different urgent care?  We didn't have any Sam Gs in our patient database, either unfortunately.  Regardless, we wish you the best in health  and are here if you need us in the future!"}<//Response>
