Did it very quickly good customer service. Other places in town said I couldn’t use my own oil or it would only be 5$ off but they let me provide the oil and the filter for a reasonable price. Very satisfied with service will go here if I need other things for my car.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Just recently bought a car from a friend that had been a little neglected and had to bring it in for a slight overhaul. Ted spent about 15-20 minutes walking me through the recommended services, helping me to figure out what could wait a bit and what needed to be done immediately, and showing me how to do some basic maintenance to stretch out the car's life before coming back for the other services. I highly recommend this shop if you are looking for an honest mechanic who does great work!

<Name>Alex Ghafouri< /Name><Review>Davis Tire Pros is an exceptional shop. I own an extremely modded car and would only take my car to the best quality shops and owner Ted has done just that, provided an exceptional shop with amazing employees and technicians who know exactly what they are doing, and do what they do with a smile. Amazing service,, great prices, and just an absolutely wonderful shop to get most of your car and tire needs completed.< /Review><gmapID>0x80852977755438f5:0x316a2f3a3a58870a< /gmapID>< Pictures>

My car's engine light went on, so I took it in for a diagnostic. I was helped by Chris who was fantastic. By the end of the day, I knew what was wrong with the vehicle and the diagnostic was complimentary! I highly suggest a visit if you ever need their services. Nice employees and a good job done.<//review>

The only good thing about this place is that their oil change was about $50, pretty cheap compared to other places here in Davis. However, the guy told me I needed two patches in both my tires because there was nails in both of them. He was going to charge me $30 for each tire! I declined, and took it to Walmart in Woodland to have them check it. They did a thorough inspection of my tires and informed me one of them didn't even have a nail, and the other tires nail came right out; wasn't even puncturing the tire! I'm so disappointed with this place trying to lie and rip me off! Completely dishonest. Be aware of this place trying to scam you!!!< /text>

I've been going to this location for years. Once you buy tires from them they take care of you. They stand behind their work and their tires, in my experience more than the dealership. They have always been friendly and their work complete on time or even early.< /text>

Until today it was 5 stars.  I have 3 cars and always go to Davis tire pros. That all changed today. Today at 1700 I discovered a nail in my tire.  I called at 1710 asking if they could help. I do believe I get that service with purchase of new tires. The guy on the phone said , that since it would take 30 min or so they would not help. What happened to customer service? He said to call AAA assuming that I have AAA I guess. I am disappointed that nobody would stay 10 min late to help out. I know bigger box stores that go the extra mile,  I guess I should not expect the same from a local business.</Review>

Never going here again!
I've been here so many times explaining the same issue and knowing that I have to drive back and forth to LA and Oregon with my front end shimmying, I go in on Saturday an hour before they close, asking them to please take a look again, see if it's just an issue that can be fixed since I need to drive up to Oregon.
My car sat there, nobody looking at it for 45 minutes, meanwhile I could be at another place that will actually look at it and help me w my problem.
What I hate most is excuses and not caring about my safety on the road.
They just lost a good customer< /review>

Went in for tire rotation and oil change because they were having a sale for under $25. Not only did they not rotate my tires but they did not inform me that they would/could not change my tires because they were too worn out until after I called to complain about them not being rotated. When I went in for a following inspection, I was "offered" a fantastic deal on new tires (sarcasm fully intended). So they attempted to up sell me some tires for full price when they couldn't even perform the initial job that I paid them for. Are these guys serious? Scam artists! I was not offered anything for the terrible job and horrendous communication skills they have. Their manager did not even offer any sort of refund for the lack of work done on my vehicle.

I also have doubts about even getting the oil changed, seeing how the dipstick had brownish oil at the bottom. So it seems as though I paid $25 for them to do nothing except lift my car with their hydraulic lift and place it back down.

I did eventually get a full set of new tires from Costco. No hassle and no BS.

I would not recommend getting anything done from these guys. Chances are, you won't even get the work you paid for. Speedee is probably the best place for a quick oil change.

Have I recommended enough places to go besides this scummy company? Any place else is better. ANY PLACE ELSE!!!

(I had this work done in 2017, so maybe they replaced their entire staff and they are under new ownership since then. I would not recommend this place to anyone)< /Text>

<review>I've gotten my last 3 sets of tires here.  It's been good until I needed to take a tire off last night.  Apparently Davis tire torqued the lug bolts on so tightly that I wasn't able to remove the tire, leaving me stranded.  I had to get a breaker bar and an impact socket after fracturing two non-impact moly sockets.  This was definitely not torqued to spec. and I wouldn't bring another vehicle here.  I just hope that this didnt strip the lug nut studs because if I have to replace those, I'm going to be super pissed.</review>< userid>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Brought in my car specifically for the check engine light. They did a lot of work on the car (breaks ect.) however the light came back on shortly after so I brought it back in. They did not believe me when I told them my check engine light was on, to the point of suggesting I misstook it for the gas light. It mysteriously "turned off" every time I brought it in. After wasting my time bringing it in 3 times and them telling me the car was fine, and the light continuing to come back on they just told me to go to the toyota dealer. $1000 later turns out tire pros put the wrong sensor in.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>I love coming here for all my services; tire rotations, brake inspections, alignments and routine check ups. My dude Erann (sorry if spelled incorrectly) always takes care of me. They take care of their Veterans at Davis Tire Pros (;< /Review>< UserId.>

<review>JR was wonderful. He was extremely patient with my husband and I as we asked a million questions. I would highly recommend Lovesac, we absolutely love our new sofa, in fact we ordered enough pieces for 2 sofas. Thank you so much JR<//review>< pics>

The Sactional is really cozy and fun in different configurations but we are still waiting on two of the deep side covers. We are glad that we contacted Lovesac and asked them to send the pieces when they were available or we would still be waiting. We have wanted a Sactional for 3 years; we finally purchased  a  7 + 8 with two storage seats, two extra deep sides, a coffee table and two power hubs on 1/3/21 and it has taken over 3 months and it is still not complete. We sent a message asking about adding some cup holders and no one answered. We have mixed feelings. We love the couch but are disappointed in the timeline that it has taken to get to this point. We were quoted 4-6 weeks but probably would arrive in 3...still waiting but comfy.<//Text>

< Review>
This Sactional is unreal!! I’ve been dreaming about owning one for quite some time. The versatility, lifetime warranty, ease of assembly, and overall comfort is what my dreams are made of.

It arrived in 5 days after we placed our order! Much faster than expected.

The team at Roseville Love Sac were the nicest, most genuine people I’ve had the pleasure of encountering recently. They took their time making sure the arrangement would fit our living room layout and helped identify the right color for us as well.

I couldn’t be happier.</Review>

Great customer service, quick delivery! Lovesac wasn’t even in my thoughts for a new couch until I did more research. Lovesac offers a 60 day trial period, fabric is washable, there’s extra storage under some cushions, lots of fabric/color choices, and numerous amounts of ways to configure seats to meet your needs<//Review>

<Time>1607572256642< /Time><rate>2<//rate><Review>Came in looking for gift ideas for the holidays, and I had seen that my synchrony card works with lovesac so when I saw 72 months 0% I was like sweet! Talked to David about the product and he informed me about
the different foam options. I was told the 0% interest free financing was available for 72 months, OR you could save $100 per every $400 spent. So, I choose the financing route because who doesn’t want to spread it out at 0%? So, after choosing on a city size love sac that I could take home that day, I verified with David that it was 72 months and he said yes. I had already finalized the order at 72 months financing and was about to walk out the store when the coworker (who I am assuming was the manager, I never got her name) said ‘oh no, you can’t finance that at 72 months, only 24’. Feeling like I had no choice, I cancelled my order and was not able to take home a Lovesac. I gave a 2 star because I felt like I was mislead and now wishing I didn’t get go in and fall in love with it. If I was able to do it at the agreed terms I would have definitely given 5 star.<//Review>< Pics>

Told me cashier check would work the next day they told me they dont accept cashier checks, checks or cash. The unnecessary hoops i've had to jump through just to get furniture are god awful. The product is good, ive wanted it since i but im livid they wasted my time going back and forth to the bank  they wasted my money issuing the cashier check AND they had to tell me to buy credit gift cards and pay with that. SERIOUSLY.<//Text>

I thought I already wrote my experience, bottom line, I wish I was given the 10% discount that I was originally quoted and was printed out for me, When I returned 2 days later, it was not honored, I still purchased the sectional and am awaiting for it’s arrival< /review>

<text>Small show room but once you go in you realize they have a little bit of everything to get an idea for what you like! If you are thinking about ordering online I highly recommend going in first and talking with one of the friendly well educated staff they will help you make the best decisions without putting and pressure on you!

<review>Great products but terrible staff and service.

When I walked in I was ignore. The person that finally did help me, was nice, but didn't really know what she was doing and the payment system took 15 mins to work. I wasn't offered anything for the inconvenience. I even offered to pay cash but I was told paying cash would have taken longer. If my wife didn't really want the blanket, I would have walked out of the store without purchasing anything. My experience was so bad that I would rather purchase something online and have it mailed to me.

Additional staff training is a must.< /review>< Rating>

<Review>I bought lovesac at costco during one of there road shows.  I was told it would be received in about 6 weeks which was great for me. It came in about 10 days. 28 boxes later and working to get rid of my old furniture I finally brought in the boxes and assembled everything. One of the pillows was defective. I sent an email with pictures and the replacement  asking for a new pillow cover and a return label. After many unanswered emails I finally told them I would just return everything.  If there customer service is so bad on a simple thing like a pillow cover what can I expect for a warranty. They have the worst costomer service I've ever incountered.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I originally bought a SuparSac around 17 years ago.  I was in high school then and thought this was so much better than a old bean bag chair.  The LoveSac followed me all thougthout my college years and even into my boyfriends apartment, when we moved in with each other back in 2011.  Our first house was small but the SuparSac made a great addition.  Then when we bought our forever home back in 2014, the SuperSac just didn’t have a place.  So I vacuumed sealed it and put it away in storage, until just this past year, 2018, we finally had a spot for it.  Fast forward to our most recent purchase, a Sactional.  We had been looking and getting quotes and reconfiguring the lay out of this Sactional for the past 3 1/2 years! Then finally went in about 3 weeks ago and found the perfect layout and covers for our newly enclosed garage/ Family Room conversion.  But still wasn’t 100 percent sure about making this purchase, as you all know they can be a little pricey, but the absolute Best thing is, it can be taken apart and laid out differently depending on what you need it to do, PLUS added bonus is that the covers actually come off the cushions to be thrown into the washer! So if you have kids, this is the couch for you!

So I would say that if you are contemplating on making a purchase at LoveSac, go ahead! Weigh your options and reconfigure and find a sales person that is will to work with you and be patient! The staff at our local LoveSac store in Roseville, CA were amazing! Sandy was so awesome that she even personally called us a couple of days before the big sale for Free Covers, they had on 4/20! So that pushed us over the egde of finally making the purchase of the Sactional!!!!!!

All I can say is, its well worth it! If my LoveSac SuperSac can with stand all the “abuse” from teenagers, college parties, moving, children, a dog....... over the past 17 years.... I cannot wait till this Sactional lasts until I’m retired!!</Review>

We just made our second purchase from Roseville Galleria. This completed our set. (For Now anyway)
We live some 100 miles from Roseville, but it was suggested by a friend that we visit this store. We did, and made our first purchase that day. We were met by Lois the sales person.
When we decided to make an additional purchase we were sure to contact LOIS. She made us feel at home, was very personable, yet professional at all times. She made sure to follow up regularly and assure our satisfaction as well as adviseing on the shipment, etc.
I can't say enough about  her as it is rather unusual to obtain that kind of service in these times.
Now, of course, we are also just as satisfied with our Lovsac couches. Have recommended them to many friends as well as directing them to contact Lois.
The product is everything that is advertised and then some.

Thanks again to Roseville Galleria store, Lois and Lovsac.

<Review>I took my son here over the weekend (Saturday & Sunday). First visit, I was in and out withing 45 minutes. Follow up visit, I was there for about 2 hrs. Despite the long wait the second time, I still believe they deserve the full 5 stars. If they can get you out right away they will, they were just busy the second time around and its understandable. Their office is super clean. They were super friendly and professional. My son HATES going to any doctors office but they made my visit easier and were very understanding.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Traveling through town, walked in 10 minutes prior to closing time. Receptionist made me feel welcome from the start and not guilty for walking in right before they close. Did not know what to expect first time being here. Marisol was extremely polite and professional. It felt as if I was dealing with the staff that know me at my primary provider’s office back home. I was seen promptly. PA Shawn was very welcoming and communicative as well. Explained alternative options for treatment in detail. After being in pain for several days, it was such a relief to find this place and the awesome staff. Will definitely return when having health issues in the area. Thank you y’all.< /Review>< Pics>

RUDELY ACCELERATED OUT THE DOOR 🦶 !
I previously went here for Covid Testing and they accepted my insurance, Well today I went in after having a fall on pavement while walking I had to use a wheelchair because my entire right leg and foot was in too much pain 🤕 to walk on.

I gave them my insurance card to verify as I was filling out the form but they said they no longer take my insurance. So they said I needed to call my insurance company to find a preferred provider. While on the phone with my insurance company sitting in the waiting room one of the receptionist just literally wheeled me outside kicking🦶 me out rudely.

The room was not full and I was not being loud or anything just trying to figure out which urgent care center will take my insurance. Bear in mind the heat today is at a record high of 105 degrees 😓.

I don't appreciate how I was treated like a number and stranger being kicked out like that.

I am kind person but this type of ignorance and rude patient treatment is uncalled for!

I don't recommend going here if they are going to treat people like that!

This organization needs to train there staff better and treat people with respect and dignity!< /text>

Came in for stitches and the provider Linda Hudson did such an amazing job, this urgent care was clean and the staff was so welcoming from the front office all the way to the girl in the back I think her name was Jessica and she was the Sweetest person I’ve ever come in contact with in a medical office setting. I’ve never had stitches done before and Linda walked me through the whole process and answered any questions or concerns I had, she didn’t make me feel bad for being nervous. So happy with my outcome< /Text>

I came in here before and was impressed by the polite and pleasant medical staff.  They were professional yet compassionate to each and every patient that came in.  I gave them 4 stars before only because I had to wait 4 hours.  This time around, I was curious to see if they were still polite and pleasant. Lo and behold, yes they were.  Smiling and gentle people.  The doctor was great!  Asked you questions,  answered your questions, and really seemed interested in what you had to say.< /Text>

Professional. Courteous. Respectful. Timely.  This is all you can ask for in an Urgent Care.  Had an ear infection and had to keep asking them to repeat their questions to me and no one ever lost patience with me, the staff all treated me with respect and dignity.  Great service, great location. I will be going back when I need to. Thanks< /text>

The ladies at the front desk were very helpful and caring, it was also an hour before closing, which can mean sometimes people are in a hurry to close up. Not the case here!!

<review>My experience was excellent. Staff is very friendly and positive. Once paperwork was summited, my wait  was less than 30 minutes that includes that paperwork. I was a walk in as well,  I had no appointment. I had been to this facility once before and chose to again this time because the staff is very efficient and thorough. Bubbly personalities. In this time of COVID, staff is risking their health for us but all remain positive. Thank all of you for what you are doing to help us.

This place really is accelerated! Love how fast I got checked in and was out. The staff was friendly. Was seen by a doctor, she forgot to introduce herself. Although the visit was quick, she made the visit seem like I was an important patient. I didn’t once feel discriminated because of my insurance, medi-cal. I was treated fairly.

Only reason why I gave this a four star rating is the cleanliness of the bathroom inside the rooms. I didn’t go to the lobby bathroom. The bathroom inside the, I don’t know what you call the area—where u go back and they see you, that bathroom over there had poop stains on the toilet. Clean once you walk in. It does need attention to detail as in scrubbing the toilet itself clean.

Would definitely go back and highly recommend this place! Thank you for taking care of me. Oh, and be careful. They make u sign a waiver form in case of mal practice 😮<//Text>

<review>I showed up feeling very unwell.
Even as a new patient they were able to get me in with in 30-45 mins. The nurse knew exactly what was wrong and sent me straight to the ER.
If it had not been for her I would be a lot worse off.
Highly recommend</review></record>

The wait was very long because I was a walk-in without an appointment. The staff were very friendly and accommodating throughout the process. Everyone was moving quickly but never ignored anyone that came in. They were very apologetic about the wait time as if it were their fault. I was really impressed and thankful that they went above and beyond to see me.<//Text>

<text>They should change name from accelerated to deceleraated bcz they what say they don't stand .  went for covid testing  firstly report was so late went to cvs they did test with quest report came negative same test  also seamless. Biggest thing they will say is they can't email or give report unless patient comes himself or sign form no other lab so they make portal I have written to cdc is it right to.call patient who is might not be well or suppose  has covid to come collect I mean that is like they are making it  spread, every other labs say stay isolate untill results come waiting for cdc to respond . Cvs Walgreen are free they will charge you which is ok but atleast deliver accelerated , front desk and staff are polite and try to do job but calling patient to collect was strange</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I visited the center yesterday for COVID testing.
The wait was long. As soon as I got in. I met the amazing, energetic, caring and competent staff.
They made sound decisions of x ray, rapid testing and diagnosed pneumonia.
I like the fact the x ray was available on site. Great job to the doctor and the support staff. Thank you</text>

The staff was friendly and attentive. I got there about 5 minutes before closing. They welcomed me in and took care of my issue. I still had to wait but not too long. They had a busy night. Hopefully I won’t have to visit again but if I need urgent care, this is where I’ll go for treatment.< /review>

<review>Came in around 11 for stitches and they told us fill paper work then tell us they are going to lunch for 40mins came back after those 40 mins and was told another 20 and not it's 1:40 still haven't been seen if I was told in the beginning they are going to lunch I would of went somewhere else. But my fault I guess.

Still waiting to get seen they lost my insurance card. 2:00pm would NEVER go here again.

Currently 1:15pm and still not have been called. If you are here for a COVID test, they are getting those patients in and out quick. But if your here for anything else good luck getting seen within the hour of your appointment.<//Review>< Pictures>

They said I couldn't be seen by a doctor without my insurance information going through their system. So I called my insurance the next day since it was to late while i was in their office. I was assured that any medical personnel could run my insurance with the insurance card I provided. I was referred to this place by my optometrist who insisted that I go if I felt like I needed immediate care. I am an African American who grow up down the street from this office. I will never go again.< /text>

<review>The service was awesome, the wait for no appointment was a little long for a covid test, but the lobby was pretty full. When checking in with the receptionist,  they should take a cell number and let people know they can wait in their cars and they will receive a text and call when it's their turn. Lots of people were not properly distanced and too many people in a small area. It seemed like People wanted to wait in their cars, but was afraid to miss their turn. Please make the proper changes. Thank you for the great service and being on the front lines to help people in these trying times.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1609267993591, 'text': 'Earning your trust as an urgent care provider is truly an honor.

<Review>Accelerated Urgent Care got me in the same day and although I didn't have an appointment, they were extremely busy with appointments and walk ins and I was a new patient; I was out within 2 hours - from New patient registration forms, seeing the doctor, testing, waiting for test results and leaving.  I've waited longer just to be seen at some urgent cares.
The front office staff, nurses and doctors were very friendly and efficient.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone who needs an urgent care.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1609267958999, 'text': 'Earning your trust as an urgent care provider is truly an honor.

I had an appointment for 2:45 & did not get called until about 4:00. Was surprised it took so long with an appointment. Once called in the people were great. Especially the doctor we spoke to who answered a lot of our questions. Very helpful.< /Text>

Was at Accelerated  in Fresno on 12/2/20 and was  being tested for covid.  Once I  made it into the exam room all 3 off the assistants or nurses or whatever they were all had gloved & gowns BUT NO MASKS. AND they were all within  3 ft. of me doing the test & blood draw. These girls are dealing  with other patients  who potentially  could have  it & they were in my face without  a mask. I left very disturbed!!<//review>

<rating>4<//rating><text>Overall good experience. I didn’t have appointment so it took a few hours to get through the whole process. The only concern I had was I only saw them wipe seats one time the whole wait, there were people in and out of those chairs. But luckily you can wait in your car and someone will actually call your phone to come in. So I’d say go with a full phone charge. They take insurance for the rapid test, you might end up with a copay depending on the insurance. They’ll also give you proof of your results too. I feel bad for those workers though, so just be a decent human being when you’re there!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1607723268619, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback.

I went in and within 20 minutes I was being seen, as soon as my vitals were taken I was taken to the room where I was going to been seen, the PA was in to check me out very soon after, as for the PA, he was great his name was Sean O’Connor and if you go to accelerated urgent care then you will be very lucky to be seen by him. In all honesty this was the best experience I have ever had in any medical clinic, or any medical facility period! The nurses were very friendly I went around 8:30 and they close at 9, even after a long day they still provided me with outstanding service!</Review>< Pics>

As instructed we arrived 15 minutes early and she went in to the waiting room. After completing the paperwork she had to wait 45 minutes to complete the test. They advertise that they offer “concierge level service” this place is a treadmill to churn out COVID-19 test so they can bill insurance companies. They’re follow-up in horrendous. While trying to get the results she was put on hold twice and waited 30-minutes until the system automatically disconnected. You’ll be lucky if someone answers the phone at all. Now we are trying to get the test results that her employer is wanting proof of the positive test results to justify her absence. What a mess, runaround and hassle. Email that are promised aren’t sent. Staff is short and truss with us.

These folks want a 3 day referal before they will see you... What a joke is urgent care that needs a referal

* Update my mom tripped and thought she broke her leg wanted to get an x-ray. To rule out a fracture. I called and they said we have to have a referral and will take 3 days. I said can I just pay you cash to do the x-ray. The gal said we do not accept cash pay customers that is against the law.

1 of 2 things is going on here the staff is undertrained or wake up america If cash is no longer being accepted at more and more places we are in for a real different america.<//review>

I went to another place the same day, and was diagnosed with a torn acl,  displaced fracture in my tibia, and a torn meniscus. The people were not kind, and rushed me out.

I spoke with someone on Friday November 20th telling the girl I needed a letter for my employer that I was unable to receive the flu shot when I was seen in their clinic on 11/14/2020 because I was sick. She put me on hold and we got disconnected and she even called me back on my personal phone to tell me that she would have a letter for me to come pick up. I came on Monday 11/23/2020 and there was no note to be found they had me waiting almost an hour and this provider Linda Hudson who I didn’t even see the day I came in said she could not give me such note. She was so rude and a straight witch. I will never come to this urgent care ever again. I don’t know why I was lied to and given the run around but this is so unprofessional. Horrible customer service. One lady had an appt at 10:30 for her and her family and it was already going on 1pm and she still had not been called back.</review>

Everyone was so friendly and caring. They apologized to everyone about the wait times even though they had no control over it. It is obvious they are working way passed their end times, i am sure for a long time. They made sure to clean the waiting room and marked chairs so there would be distance between everyone. Maricela was especially wonderful.< /Text>

<review>I was refer by my Healthcare Premera BCBA and I made an appointment with them for a rapid covid testing. The lady at the desk was nice and respectful when I walked up to the counter. Had to sign some paper work and then waited 30-40min to get tested and received the results within 10 min. The workers here were nice and respectful and everyone that worked here had a great personality & attitude. I really felt welcome as a first timer being here. I will come again here next time if anything and thankyou for you guys great customer service and keep doing good.

Unprofessional and the wait time is insane. Please consider new hires that actually know what they are doing and not just pass other walk-ins that didn’t arrive before you! Please do something about this! These are people that should’ve gone through school and professional training. It’s so hard to get through a phone call. Customer service skills suck. I can do a much better job! I’m glad I can please and serve my community at my job at my location. It’s how it should be period.<//Review>

The only reason I came here was because I could get covid testing done without a referral or symptoms. Other than that, never again. The medical assistant taking people's vitals wasn't friendly at all. There was no social distancing. Thank God for masks and the option to go sit in my car. The person who checked me in at the front told me results take 3-7 days. Then the medical assistant in the back told me 5-7 days. And finally the actual physician told me 3-5 days. Here I am on day 7 and have heard nothing. Can they PLEASE get on the same page? Luckily my employer is patient and understands the situation.< /Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>I went here for COVID testing and was utterly appalled at how little they seemed to care about safety measures. The way they are running this place - during a pandemic with cases on the rise in Fresno county - is frankly unacceptable.

Walking in, I heard a group of about 15 people mingling outside talking about how one of their coworkers had tested positive for the virus, and so they were all getting tested. They were not wearing masks. If even one of them had it, I would bet that by now, all of them do. And they could have infected the many people walking in, because they were positioned right by the door. The workers allowed this to happen.

Inside the waiting room, there were no social distancing measures being practiced whatsoever as people sat packed together side-by-side. There was a note reminding people to wash the pens, but not once did I see that happen. There was not one bottle of hand sanitizer in the lobby; at least not available for patients to use. They did not regularly wipe down the armrests and seats.

In my SIX HOURS of waiting in the parking lot for a test (I did not feel safe waiting inside) I did not even once see anybody wipe down the door handle. It was a pull door, meaning every person that went in and out had to touch it. Equally horrifying, I watched three nurses walk out of the front door without wearing a mask.

Irrespective of their disregard for safety, they were consistently dishonest. I got to Accelerated Urgent Care at around 11 AM, when they told me it would be a two-hour wait. They kept amending the time until finally letting me go back six hours later at 5:30 PM. I understand the wait. What I do not understand is the dishonesty. They should have been honest with me upfront, and I could have gone home for a few hours before coming back. If they tell you that the wait will only be two hours DO NOT BELIEVE THEM.

If I didn't have the virus before I went into this place, I might now. I would not be surprised if the place is in violation of current Health Department regulations. They failed to follow the simple guidelines of wiping down door handles and requiring patients to wear masks.

EDIT: In response to the response below from the owner - I called the number you gave me down below and it was not the Customer Service Department, it was the general phone, and they did not actually want to hear my feedback.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

< Review>
This is the worst urgent care in Fresno. I had to get a Covid test per my doctors request a couple weeks ago and the receptionist told me I didn’t have insurance which isn’t correct. I called my insurance and they sent them a fax verifying it was valid. My husband is under my federal insurance and had gone in to test for Covid in July, he had no issues at all. Covid testing is covered with valid insurance. Today I check my bank account and 279.00 was withdrawn by this urgent care. I had to call my insurance company to let them know what had happened. The representative called them and they had to refund my money. Terrible place! Beware!< /Review>

The receptionist was really helpful but the services sucked.  I was there from 8 am to 1130 am and still wasn't able to checked in.  So I asked for my documents and left.  There were also some people that left before me.</Review>

<review>I went for Covid testing.  Was told it would be a 2 hour wait.  It turned into 6 hours.  That still was okay.  But the safety measures were nonexistent.  There was no social distancing.  We sat elbow to elbow in the witing room.  Some people went outside, but there was no seating outside.  Also 102 degrees outside. No disinfecting of doors or chairs or the front counter that everyone leaned on. The service itself was good .  They were thorough and friendly.  Would like to go back in an emergency, but please work on your sanitary  measures.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1593458403962, 'text': 'Holly, at Accelerated Urgent Care we value your time.

<Review>I got tested for COVID at this location. I have also tested before through LHI. The two experiences were extremely different, LHI was much safer. At Accelerated Urgent Care, it did not seem like they were taking any precautions against the virus. There were no social distancing requirements for the lobby. Nor did they have a limit on how many people can be in the lobby. They did not wipe down any seats when I was there over a two hour period. There was no antibacterial available for patients (except behind the counter, not visible, had to ask). I did not feel safe, and the staff was not friendly. I will not be returning.</Review>< rate>

<review>This was a horrible mistake I made. They did not wipe down anything once while I was waiting over 3 hrs that even before they called me to finish my paperwork. I should have relized it when the first words out thier mouth was " do you have insurance" If this was not a serious issue I would have left. Yep a horrible mistake!

Went to go get covid 19 tested got turned away because they didn't take my medical. Ask if i could pay out of pocket they said no. I would not recommend this place at all. They accepted my husbands medical he has been waiting on covid results for quite some time now and has not recieved anything back he can't go to work untill he gets his test results it is really absurd. They really do not care about the patients and are not organized when my husband went to go do the test he had an appointment the lady acted like she forgot he had an appointment she asked "you have an appointment you told me you had an appointment."

My sister and I went in to be tested for covid. My sister gave her insurance card. The front desk attendant told us they did not take my sisters insurance and that she had to pay around 200$ to be tested. Shortly after, my sister spoke with her insurance and found that accelerated did in fact take her insurance. Bottom line - the front desk attendant told my sister they didn’t take her insurance ........ when in reality they definitely do take her insurance. So I’m very unsettled at the fact that my sister paid 175$ cash after being misinformed by their employee. Curious if they have done this with others.<//review>

This urgent care is a joke. Took my covid 19 testing and still having got it back. It's been a little over a week and still no test results back. The excuse is thats its busy and they haven't had the chance to get it done but I doubt that given how unprofessional they were. On top of that. I asked for a doctors note and they said I was able to go back to work the next day after the COVID 19 testing. Which I dont understand because it takes a week to develop symptoms and another week or 2 to recover so I felt as if they didn't care to ask when I need it for and just went ahead to write it down real quick. Waste of 175 dollars to get a 5 minute testing . Never had such a bad experience with urgent cares ever until this . Would not recommend to anyone.< /Text>

There was no social distancing, everyone sat next to each other.The employees were busy talking to each other rather than checking in visitors. The nurse used the same gloves to type in  information in her computer, she touched her glasses, scratched her head, than took my vitals. I waited a hour before they called a person to the back and my total wait was three hours. I only had 3 people in front of me. For vitals and a mouth swab it shouldn't take that long.</Text>

Don’t waste your time coming here, if you plan on testing for Covid 19, room is full of people, 4 hour wait, no supervisors or managers at faculty, go at your own risk.<//Text>

Worst experience I have ever had, waited over 4 hours to do a covid19 test, the staff did not care about any of us waiting and worked so slowly. nearly everyone had waited for atleast 3-4hours to do a 10minute test. Unacceptable.</review>

Love this place, it was so fun showing my kids what a video store was.  So sad they are closing down. I hope someone will buy this store and continue to give people an alternative way to streaming.  Even if you paid for every streaming service,  All the Best Video will have more at a better price point as well. Knowledgeable staff and great selection! 😎👍< /text>

Going to the movie store on a Friday night to pick up one video for the kids and one for the parents is so cool. Everyone who works there is a movie buff with tons of recommendations. Seriously, the death of video rental stores is so sad. This place is amazing.< /text>

This place makes me so happy! I've been going here since I was a kid and still rent at least once a month-usually one of the 5 movie deals. The selection is huge and they rent and sell both brand new and very old movies. They have a great snack selection and friendly staff. Support your local video store!</text>

I remember before it was a video store it was a bar, can't recall the bars name but I remember Peter Chu's was a Shakey's pizza.  Went there for years, sadly I no longer live in Chico.  Great memories and happy to see a video store still around.  We used to rent vcr's and video game decks there.<//review>

All the best video has been around again since my mother was a child. They have always had me wondering what it is about them because they're the only video store left in this town lol. Out lasting all the big stores like  Blockbuster, Hollywood Video and are holding their ground against redbox. There can be only one. Friendly people great deals and their candy is VERY cheap lol. #fatty< /review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Date>1540076243407<//Date><Text>I was disappointed to learn that I could not rent a video because I did not have a California ID, due to being an out-of-state student. When I offered to show my student ID, which proves that I do go to a local school, I was still told that wouldn't be sufficient. I would give one star, but I'm giving three stars because the staff were courteous. I hope this policy of not renting to those without a California ID is dropped, given that this is a college town, and some students may not have a California state ID.</Text><rating>3< /rating>< user_id>

Some months after setting up our account and renting movies and returning on time, I was told that I couldn’t rent a movie because I didn’t have a piece of mail with my home address on it. Apparently they’d tried to send us something and it came back returned. I tried to explain that the clerk who set up my account would only put in the address on my license (we’d recently moved) and so I knew it was wrong, but they refused to list my new address. I don’t, however, take my mail around town with me. So after calling to see if they had what I wanted, driving across town, finding it in the store, and then being told I can’t rent it because I don’t have a piece of mail....Haven’t been back since.</text>

<userid>105220132653197528350</userid><time>1510447406698<//time><text>I've had an account here for several years. Guessing close to a decade. I brought my kids in today and we picked out 4 movies for the weekend.

The employee at the counter says because I haven't rented 50 movies from them, we can only rent 2 new releases. That's their policy; until you've rented 50 movies, you're limited as to how many movies you can take home.

So there I am, a paying customer with an account in good standing, cash in hand, explaining to my 5 year old why she can't take home all the movies she picked out.

I love the store experience and am willing to pay extra for it, but not if we can't load up on whatever movies we choose. There's a big Red Box down the street that'll let us rent as movies as want for less money.<//text><Rating>2</Rating><pictures>None</pictures>< GmapID>

Total rip off....be carefull....late fees never stop accumulating, paid over 30 bucks for 1 late movie, it was late (20 days) but  that is a ridiculous late fee.. cancelled account,  hope they follow in the footsteps  of blockbuster.</review>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>I rented a DVD of an old cartoon for my daughter. The DVD played half way through and kept shutting off. I tried two DVD players so I knew it was the disc. I didn't bother saying anything when I brought it back because she tore the back of the case and the back cover. (She's 3) I brought it in to buy the DVD and they kept the DVD and charged me $2 for the case (reasonable) and FIVE DOLLARS for "cover replacement" what irritated me is the front cover was not damaged and they kept both the case they charged me for and the front cover. They have two copies of the cartoon in the store to easily copy the back cover. So if I paid for the case and the cover shouldn't I get to keep them? Not to mention it cost more to replace that BROKEN old Mario TV show cover and case than it did to rent the movies, and the entire price of the DVD wouldn't be worth that. Seemed like a poor way to do business with a potential weekly customer, and I won't be back.<//Text>< username>

All The best Video I was and am still amazed is still a solid pillar allowing Chico residents to pick a movie up and even drop it off out front like the old days even this year 2014 when I went to visit my Parents for Easter is still offering the latest DVD titles Blu-ray and Games. .<//text>

Thank You, to all the staff. Yesterday I interrupted your lunch I apologize. Thank You for your service! Liked the way you priced your prices based on the internet, you could’ve not been any more fair than that with me. I’m very happy I bought from you! You can believe anyone asking where did I get this, I will proudly tell them! THANKS AGAIN 📚📚📚< /Text>

<Review>Great service.   I called and told them what I needed, and they told me that they had it in stock. It was close to closing time so I asked them If they would be there in a 1/2 hour because that's how long it would take me to get there. They told me they would wait for me to make sure I got the product that I needed. I truly appreciate the great customer service that I received.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Very good Customer Service, Yvonne went out of her way to take pictures and send them to us to look at product . To me that's above and Beyond to me. They also do price match only on the same item that you are purchasing. She also goes out of her way to give a good discount, I would recommend to customers to shop here they also carry all kinds of medical equipment & accessories i would've not thought about. Thank you Yvonne for the good Service:)< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Name>

Tayler was a very nice young lady. Very welcoming. I usually don’t come into stores for this, I order online because it it very uncomfortable to go out in public. But tayler made me feel comfortable and helped me with all and any question I had. I am definitely going back and telling my friends and family members about this store. At my age it is refreshing to meet such a lovely and caring young lady.<//Review>

We purchased a scooter from Active Mobility about a year ago and  recently had a lift installed in the back of our car to get the scooter in and out.  Both transactions were very positive.  Active did not carry the scooter we wanted but they ordered it special.  Installing the lift was a challenge but the job was completed very professionally and the employees treated our vehicle like it was their own.  VERY HAPPY to have Active Mobility in our community.

Glad everyone had a great experience with these crooks because when I did business with them, they tried to rip me off. Thank God I used my Visa to pay for "parts" and not cash like I almost did. My father died before I could get the chair (already in stock) installed and when I told them that I wouldn't be needing it, they kept my $600 of my deposit as their "restocking fee". The kid wasn't even nice about it. I didn't argue. I left and called Visa who managed to get my full refund. Right now, i'm in the market for a mobility scooter for myself. And guess what? I wouldn't buy a box of band aids from the people! Bye Felicia!</Text>

Terrible place to buy from. Over charges for everything. Refused refund for only two hours. Makes up prices for what they sell. Be very careful buying from them. Check prices elsewhere, BEFORE YOU BUY. Can not trust them. They are the professionals and what they tell you, should be correct. They over charged me 200.00 for a BATTERY, that is available anywhere for under 80.00. MRSLP IS ONLY 89.00. Is this a way to run a business. They stole 200.00 from me, don't let them take from you.</Text>

<Review>Very friendly and respectful staff.  The Salesman Chris was very PATIENT and understanding in his dealing with my Mother.  My mom asked him if her new Scooter could do "Wheelies"  I thought his answer was really cool 😎. Apparently, so did my mom - She bought the Scooter and added a "Roll-Bar". 😂😂😂<//Review>< user>

They have a good selection of stuff but the prices are way too high. People go to thrift stores because they cant afford to pay full price for new items but the stuff here is just as expensive. The people at the front seemed to be friendly though.<//Review>

Absolutely love this place. Love the staff as well, not sure what the other people on here are talking about.  I go in there everyday and spend $10-$20 and very much worth it. As long as their prices stay consistent,  I will be consistent as well. Management is super sweet as well. I think she deals with a lot and most people in the area don't know how to respect others if she was not letting you have your way. Just overall great place.</review>

This is a great place to find material if you like to sew.  Prices are not consistent, but they do have some great bargains here.  I got four nice place mats with two matching napkins for under a dollar.  There was another set of four not so nice place mats for about $2.</Text>

Ridiculous prices. Someone needs to remind them that their items were donated so to price items at retail value when they're clearly used is ridiculous. Never coming back.< /Review>

Delusional pricing. I am talking absolutely bonkers. I have seen items in here go unsold for literal years. They think every item they have belongs on antique roadshow. They have a used church rug priced at literally $2000. DVD players priced at $50, Calculators at $40, Destroyed furniture at hundreds. Don't forget that the inside of the store is disgusting. No wonder why they are losing their building. You are better off ordering things full price from eBay.< /Review>

IF you find anything worth buying their prices are through the roof for used item. Whoever you put in charge of pricing is ruing your store. And there donations go to support Ripon Christian Schools. People your donations are going to support another county. Why would you donate here??<//text>

So - is this an antique store or a thrift store? They are making 100% profit on donated items and charging more than what local antique stores do for similar items.</Text>

These people put up w/a lot of theft and associated B.S......I understand their frustration.That does not mean that it's ok to stereotype, profile, and disrespect,  every homeless and "weird" patron that walks in.
I see it every time I go in there to shop. At times I've just walked out because of the way the employees are allowed to treat their customers, and I am not one that can just ignore it.< /text>

< Review>
I found some nice items and was walking around with them. A Queen Bee in a short blond bob asked, "Were those on the floor?" (Implying I got them out of the back). I showed her were they were on the shelf and she walked off w/o comment.  Jan 11, 2017 @ 1000. Generally, the people here are so nice. She doesn't need to work there anymore. Holier than thou people, acting superior to and suspicious of thrift shoppers is not very christian-like.< /Review>

<Text>So yesterday I went in to get a silk scarf for my dress...couple minutes later I decided to get a new outfit somewhere else so about an hour later I decided to return the scarf since i no longer needed it. My boyfriend went in and asked for a refund the manager said because we no longer wanted it they can't do a refund. But still yet asked my boyfriend if he even had a receipt? Like if it mattered when she had already stated that they can't do a refund...as if she was implying something. Either way it was a dumb reason why not to get a refund. Or she could've at least let me trade my scarf for a different one. Since I no longer needed it that specific scarf to match my dress. I believe it was bad service. I will never shop there again.<//Text>< username>

Pretty neat festival. Lots of vendors, food and even stuff the kids will like. Free admission so no real complaints. Can wonder through the whole thing in maybe an hour or less (that even is taking your time). After this, walk over to Old Town to finish your day!< /Text>

Lots of vendors, lots of people. With a live band, a silent disco and all the drinks you can handle it is hard to go wrong. The best part of the venue is location as they shut down capitol from the bridge to the capitol building. Tons of food and a good time.<//Text>

Great food and music.
You have to purchase tickets for wine and beer. $10 gets u 1 glass of wine and $6 get u 1 glass of beer.  Although the event is free u have to pay for everything else of course.
Great informational booths about bee keeping to farm tours. Everything about sustainability. The event is doing friendly.
There are picnic tables spread through the event. Food demonstrations, coffee demonstrations.
Parking cost about $15.< /Review><user_name>Tracey Beaty< /user_name><gmapID>0x809ad12ddcdddf81:0xdb457aa55b6e6524< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>A great place to see what the farming community has to offer the people of the central valley. It's to bad that only a select few get to enjoy the dinner served on the bridge every year! As they have their secretaries place orders for dozens of tickets at a time. By the time the average job gets threw, all the tickets are sold out. Last year 3/4 of the tickets were presold. Before  the became available to the general public!< /text>< Pics>

< review>
It was ok. Got me out of the house. Not much farm to fork. I thought for sure there would be at least a few stands with fresh fruit or vegetables from the farm I could fork.  Mostly beer and wine stands with slim to no selection of beverage. NO random samples of anything. I did in the other hand find one stand that served mixed drinks. At 8$ a Solo cup it seemed to be the reasonable decision to make over the same priced beer. The drinks surprised me. They were amazing. Once again,  I had only a choice of two, the line was very fast. Quik enough to go back a second time. Which was a fantastic way to deal with the large amount of people that were fenced onto a main street. People were very chilled. So it wasn't horrible. The live band was decent and had a good sound considering they were next to the last band on the board. My girlfriend took me. We had a good time together there. Very much dog friendly. That was a plus. We love dog's. Over all it was okay.<//review>

Good experience. Friendly atmosphere. The space is a bit confined so when it got busy, it felt a bit claustrophobic. Consider a larger area.</text>

I had a great time walking around downtown Sacramento as they shut down several blocks to cars and opened up for people to walk from vendor to vender. Many types of food served and plenty of fresh produce to buy!< /Review>

This was our first time visiting the Farm to Fork Festival. It was very disappointing we could not get to any booths to see what they had to offer. The walk ways were too narrow for the number people attending.  Not a good location!  We ended up leaving after an hour.</text>

I was so very pleased and excited about the first order of LEI'S I placed for a very special event. The LEI'S were gorgeous and made my ohana joyful and proud. Another special event and the only crown,  fitting, are of these( Hawaiian beauties) , Nele's authentic Hawaiian LEI'S . *only these WILL DUE!!!  Such warm professional people here at this florist shop!  The amazing reactions from the gift of these beautiful LEI'S is invaluable! This is my signature and pride for all of my future events!  I couldn't have asked for anything more!! Mahalo nui loa! No' ka oi!**" "For all the mainlanders**- "(THANK you so much! You're #1!!) I don't think twice to refer my friend' s or co-workers!  Or anyone i see needs suggestions to  complete any event!!  Nele,  your LEI'S are magical!  They just are the icing on the cake! Last time, my friends received LEI'S from your shop, they were so happy they sent me photos of themselves, after the event... They were: *at home cleaning the dishes with the LEI on! Then vacuuming with the LEI on! Then walking her dog ASTRA,  with the LEI on! Then in bed with the LEI on!  It is  such a beautuful and special feeling of pure joy and pride one gets when wearing or giving one of your LEI'S! Sooo touching for me! It just makes me so happy! Thanks again!!!  I am a rock star with your LEI'S!   I know I did it sooo right!!! With your shop, and flowers. ***Not just flowers though people.... Step it up,  *go with the Hawaiian Lei !!  ***  You won't get better quality flowers or authentic Hawaiian style LEI'S ,  from the sweetest people at a great price ,  anywhere else around here! Total Aloha spirit!  See you folks soon!

<Review>This place is the original and best wine provider in my area. It is a really good place to drink good beers and wines with your friends and families as well. They also offer tasty foods at a very affordable price. For me, they have the widest selection of imported and local wines in my area. Highly recommended to everyone.<//Review>< Rate>

These guys truly have the best wines in town, and It's nice because we bought some at a very affordable price. I think tonight will be a good night for all of my friends and family!

Absolutely terrible customer service! I have been waiting for a bottle of wine from them since March 23 (shipping date) and today is April 2. FedEx has no idea where there is and when it might be delivered and Blackwell's will not press them on this issue. I will never order from them again. I was formerly a US Navy officer, and don't believe that as one who faithfully served in the Persian Gulf, should be treated so poorly. Good Bye to Blackwell's!< /Text>

<review>In this day and age it's difficult to trust anyone, especially an on line retailer. I took a gamble from Miami and placed my first order. I must say, I now will ONLY ORDER FROM BLACKWELL'S. They are truly authentic, they CARE. After several orders I can honestly say, I read their recommendations and order with confidence. They promptly and professionally pack each order as if it was their own. Pricing is MORE THAN FAIR with freight included. They don't know me and treat me like family, what else can I say.  I am lucky I found them. All the Very Best to this team!< /review>< pics>

<review>I placed an order Sunday for the new Ciroc Summer Citrus and it came well boxed and sooner than expected. I was a bit concerned because I've never ordered off line but Blackwell's  proved me wrong. I would definitely recommend them and will order more. I needed this Ciroc because it's not sold here in Chicago and I love Ciroc and have every flavor. Thank you Blackwell's for great service!!!< /review>< Pics>

Quick response to messages.  However, I'm glad I didn't wait for an update, message, or newsletter about product availability I was wanting, or I would have missed it again.  I was told "later in the week," and I kept checking and searching the website daily until I was able to order.  Safe, secure packaging.

<Date>1600293326512<//Date><Rating>5</Rating><text>I ordered a pretty rare bourbon earlier in the year, with all of this Covid craziness I missed the delivery and wasn’t able to pick up the delivery at the FedEx drop off point before it was sent back to Blackwells. I called Blackwells and asked to have it resent to me, but they told me new restrictions made it so they couldn’t ship to my area, so they gave me a refund. About 2 months later, I get a call from Blackwells, as it turns out, they can ship to my area again, and they remembered that I still wanted my bourbon. They set one aside for me, and asked if I wanted it resent to me. What great customer service!! I was able to get the bourbon just in time to give it to my father in law for his birthday. I’ll be a Blackwells customer for life now:)< /text>< Pics>

Beyond poor customer service IMO.  Emailed them to confirm specifics of my order, then still did not ship what I asked for or what they advertised, told me it was too hard to keep track and it was close enough and asked me why it mattered.  Super professional!< /Text>

So happy to have found this place willing to hurdle the latest state-specific alcohol laws and ship to Michigan! Great updated selection of bourbons / whiskeys. They do an amazing job packing/shipping quickly and the prices are very reasonable, including free shipping if you spend $300+.<//Review>

Ordering was really easy and the prices are great! The only downside is the use of FedEx shipping. I ordered on Tuesday (12/10) and was supposed to get the order by Friday (12/13). I have reached out to FedEx multiple times and basically got "You'll get it when you get it" as a response.

I know Christmas time is happening, but when the shipment shows it is here in Phoenix where I ordered it and sits for days it is really annoying.

I know Blackwell's shipped it out and they cannot control FedEx, but I just wish a better shipping company was used.
I'm aware you can choose Express Options when shipping, but if something shows it will arrive by the time you need it and you can save money by choosing ground, why wouldn't you?

In any case... hope to receive the shipment soon... :/<//text>

<review>Blackwell's doesn't always carry some of the standard mainstream items found at other liquor stores.......and this is a good thing because I can find those things plentifully elsewhere. They do however carry some of the more unique and obscure items that I have trouble finding other places which
I certainly appreciate. Their customer service has been excellent in all my interactions with them as well< /review>< gmap_id>

I'd like to give this company no stars, but I need to give it one star to be able to post this. Appaulling customer service. Bottles arrived to the UK damaged and leaking after being inadequetly packaged. The attitude of Gary when we contacted him about it was appaulling. It took 2 and a half weeks of emails, in which we had to continually chase to get any responce. We never had an apology, and the tone of emails was rude and really disinterested in our situation. Eventually we did manage to get a part refund for the damaged bottles, but it seemed it was more to 'shut us up'. In addition to this we were hit with a bill from Fed Ex Customs and Duty for $150 for bottles which were worth $120 which we didnt expect at all. BEWARE the international shipping charges do NOT include any customs or duty tax. Nowhere in the checkout process on the website does it say this at all. You will only find reference to this if you read the shipping policy small print on another page in the footer.  Will NEVER use this company again. I dont know how they are still in business with the total lack of Customer Services. Avoid like the plague.< /review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>When the state-run liquor stores were shut down in PA, no one knew how long it would last. Once that one month mark hit, we were out of some staples. I ran across Blackwell’s online and decided to take a chance on successful, unbroken-bottle-delivery from CA. Prices were very slightly higher than buying locally, which was the only “complaint” I’d have (but really - I have none).

They didn’t disappoint. In about a week I had everything I ordered, with one substitution that they were very thoughtful to call and discuss with me. Everything arrived very well-packed and in one piece. Got some hard to find stuff, like AO Vodka and premium (not green) Creme de Menthe. I may order again even after things reopen here, as they have some interesting finds I know I won’t see in PA. Thanks, Blackwell’s!!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>I just received my order from Blackwell’s. I’m very pleased it was early (a part of a Valentine’s Day gift). The packaging was awesome no damage. The ordering process was super easy. I order a bottle of salted caramel crown royal, after not being able to find it anywhere (out of season). Blackwell’s was a life saver. This was my first time ordering online, and I will definitely be doing it again! 😄<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808587103b1648fd:0x1e0c6cf7395dd024</gmapID></record>

I had placed an order without paying much attention and later realized the shipping was more expensive than the bottle. I emailed as soon as I noticed to inquire about canceling the order. Gary was more than accommodating and understanding and made sure my order was successfully canceled. Great customer service!</Review>

Quick shipping and secure packaging! I was skeptical about ordering online at first but I'm glad I took the chance and plan to order more in the near future.<//Review>

Gary was very prompt in responding to me when I was concerned that my package was lost (a FedEx issue, nothing to do with Blackwells). Even though the package was later than expected, I still received it on the exact day that I needed it! The product was an anniversary gift and nearly impossible to find on the East Coast, Blackwells had it at an a very reasonable price. This made my fiancé’s day as he’s been looking for this bottle for years :) Thank you Gary!!<//Review>

I live in Colorado and was having trouble locating a specific whiskey locally.  I searched the internet and came across Blackwell's.  I read some of the reviews and felt comfortable with placing my order.  I placed the order over the weekend and my package was delivered in under a week.  Packaging was perfect and the whiskey arrived safely.  Price was VERY good.  Would definitely recommend purchasing from Blackwell's.

Non-Existing Customer Support.  Needs to be shut down. In the beginning of November I physically went into the store to purchase a rare whiskey for a friends birthday in Dec.  I would be volunteering at an NGO in Ghana saving lives and couldn't attend my friends party.  On checkout the woman said I should order it online and they would deliver it the day of the party instead of me having to figure out logistics with another friend.  I triple confirmed and said this is extremely important and I am fine doing the logistics myself.  She seemed nice enough and I did the purchase online in the store.  I physically had the bottle in hand.  What could go wrong.  I got a confirmation the day before at 3am Ghana time that it would be delivered and needed to confirm time.  Granted I have no running water, intermittent WiFi and little to no electricity but was able to get the email out. Then the next day 1 hour before the party (again 3am my time) I get an email that their distributor miscalculated and they will have to refund my order.  I'm sorry you just made your problem my problem.  I emailed back and said for them to fix their problem.  All they had to do I found out weeks later was walk 2 blocks away and buy one from another store and deliver.  They refused to fix their problem and with no further communication I was stuck.  I didn't get the refund til 2 weeks later.  I had a decision to make.  Save lives or fix the problem they put in my lap.  I chose to be a better person then them and do what I promised and save lives.  I got someone weeks later to help me with the problem they gave me.  We found some WiFi and found stores with the rare whiskey but the problem being in a dry country in Africa is that I couldn't purchase alcohol on line and the timing difference didn't allow me to make a phone call... I finally after a month found a place in Los Angeles though there were 4 stores in SF with one being blocks away from Blackwell that helped me out.  Granted my surprise Bday Present was almost a month late but fixed Blackwells problem.  All I know is they would rather have people die (literally) then fix their customer service problems.  I hope this review inspires people to go else where.  The world doesn't need this type of people in it right now.  In contrast I just took a weekend break to another dry country in Africa (Cairo, Egypt) where I ordered a bottle of alcohol on the menu for room service. They apologized and said they were out of that bottle. I thought nothing about it until an hour later the hotel manager who doesn't drink drove his personal car to a nearby liquor store and got me the bottle I wanted and hand delivered it to my room with his apologies.  That is customer service!  We could learn from emerging countries.  I feel Blackwell represents the worse of the United States and forgets why he is in business.< /review>

I purchased three bottles of Proper No 12 from this store. Since I'm out of state it required shipping to my house. The price was right and not inflated due to the popularity of the brand (other stores charge $34-49). The shipping price was also affordable. Overall a great service, thank you AAAAA+++++.< /Text>

<Review>I was looking for an American whiskey I couldn't get anywhere in Europe. Blackwell's was one of the few who could ship it.

<review>we did order several bottles of alcohol. Unfortunately the bottles did arrive damaged and the shop refused to ship us new bottles and did also not retransfer us our money. Therefore i highly recommend to avoid ordering anything on their online shop. The boss Gary is pretty impolite and does not really like to stay in touch with customers.< /review><GmapID>0x808587103b1648fd:0x1e0c6cf7395dd024</GmapID><Rate>1</Rate>< Time>

Purchased a 2011 St.Emilion Grand Cru for $35 and asked if the price was a mistake. The clerk said it was not. After tasting it I say it most certainly was  This wine should be selling for 2-3 times as much. Get it while you can. And don't hesitate to subject the knowledgeable staff to military style interrogation. They will not back down. Now if they would only  stock Trockenbeerenauslese. I offered to buy a case a month! Oh well, I guess you can't have everything.< /review>

After being very excited to find a specific vintage of wine, online, Blackwells shipped me a totally different vintage. When I notified them of this, Alyssa stated very matter of fact-like that "it happens occasionally that the wrong wine is listed online". She stated they would send me the one bottle they DID HAVE of the vintage I actually ordered, after I returned the shipment of the wrong wine. I went ahead and returned that shipment, only to contact Alyssa about the bottle of the correct vintage she had promised, and have her reply to me that they no longer had the bottle they had promised. So disappointing. Very poor customer service, and I would not recommend purchasing anything from them online, nor would I trust what their sales representatives say.<//Review>

Ordered a bottle of bourbon for a friend's birthday present. Unknown to me, after receiving a confirmation of shipment,  they cancelled the order 2 hours later but didnt call or text to try to follow up with me. I received an email the following day. After calling to get the order straightened out, I was told I would get a phone call back. The call never came. No follow up. Poor service. Management should drink less of their product and concentrate more on buisness. Look elsewhere.< /Review>

My usual online provider was late getting back to me (partially because they're in Ireland, partially just being slow) for an order I needed as I was hosting a tasting. They were out of stock and I found what I needed at Blackwells. They went above and beyond to fulfill my order and get it to me in a timely manner per my urgent request. Needless to say, I now have a vendor in Ireland and in the US as I'll be back to Blackwells in the near future. It's these small assists that go a  long way in creating repeat customers and I am now one of those. Thanks so much!<//Text>

I acquired a half case of fine wine from Blackwell's.  Process was completely seamless as it had to be shipped to Texas.  This can be rather difficult in itself as interstate shipping laws complicate things.  Blackwell's was properly priced, notified immediately of my acquisition and Gary himself mentioned he would send a wooden case as I had requested.  Great seller; will be doing business again.<//Text>

I may choose to purchase from Blackwell's again, but my experiences have left concerned about their inability to empathize with their customers when they make mistakes.

I placed an order online for seven bottles from Blackwell's in early December, but only 4 arrived. I called and spoke with owner Gary regarding the issue.

While he did apologize, Gary was dismissive about the incident, mentioning their high sales volume, exemplary service, and extremely low error rate. While he didn't exactly hang up on me, he did end the call abruptly.

Gary then followed up with via email after my initial review, seeking to confirm that I still wanted him to send the replacement bottles. He also seemed frustrated that I left him a three-star review on Google.

While he did not include a direct threat, his message seemed intentionally personal, including both my job title and company name. I respond to him directly, indicating that I was only trying to help other customers based upon my experience.

The missing bottles arrived as expected a few days later.</Text>

<Review>I had purchased a bottle of extremely hard to find beer as a gift for my husband and the order was cancelled. I contacted customer service to see why the order had been cancelled and I was informed that there is a 6 bottle minimum on beers. When I access the mobile site, this message is not present and I was allowed to checkout and pay $21 for ground shipping which is a bit excessive. Gary's customer service skills teeter on non-existent, the man went to the lengths of searching me and then referencing the company that I work for when stating "all companies have policies". What a creep!

Update... Seller is unprofessional, but that is clear from the response below.</Review><user_name>Lauren< /user_name>< Response>

I've been buying from Gary for years now and have had a great relationship with him until now. I recently ordered a bottle of  Ama No To Sake assured by the description that it was Kosher. Being an Observant Jew I can only consume kosher certified wine and spirits. When I received the bottle I could find no kosher certification on the bottle. Then when I checked the kosher certification sites (CRC and Star K) I found it was not approved and further that only the top 2 grades of sake were considered kosher. This sake is a grade below the top 2. Gary states he went by what the producer had told him and wrote to the producer who said that his sake "could be considered kosher"... I told him that was obviously self-serving and asked him for some consideration as I could not drink the product. He REFUSED!! This is an extremely important issue for me for religious reasons but the $30 is obviously more important than anything to Gary. What a shame... I will not be doing any more business with him.< /text></record>

I always come here to grab an exotic beer or liquor. Huge wine selection as well. May not have the selection of a bevmo, but it's charm, and friendly staff make it a nice local hub for purchasing high end liquors.< /text>

Ordered a bottle of bourbon and It shipped 11 days ago. Still waiting for FedEx  Come on ! 12 days from California to North Carolina !  Blackwells need to use UPS !!! OK maybe not Blackwell"s fault !!! Improved shipping might get more stars.</review>

I went in to pick up a diaper bag and my free goody bag. I interacted with two store associate who were very nice. One assisted me in finding the store price scanner, the other at the cashier, and I didn’t get their names. But, Angela at the baby registry was my last interaction. She wasn’t very friendly or helpful in trying to locate my registry number. She finally asked for my name and due date and that’s when she finally pulled up my registry. Would return just would ask for assistance from someone else.< /text>

Fabian the camera man is the BOMB. He is so great  with kids. He has a very friendly personality and really loves what he does. If you want your baby to smile he is surly your guy. Not many people are as passionate about what they do as Fabian. I could not have ask for better camera man. Highly recommended photo guy.</Text>

Fabien at the photography area was so sweet and helpful. My sister went to go pick up the family photo of her, her son, and her husband who recently passed away. It was a photo shoot package I gave them a year ago. She went to go pick up what was left. Fabien was so kind and helpful during the times of pain. I am grateful that you had someone like him to help her out. It meant a lot to us. Thank you Fabien. I hope I spelled your name right. -Diana<//text>

I’ll rate them a 4-Star today. We went here because we found some things online we wanted to get for the upcoming baby. And we found out that the items were not in the store. That’s fine no problem however we had to look for help. This was an issue considering things were somewhat hard to find.

However, the lady that checked us out to pay was amazing she offered us 20% off each item from a 3rd party site to save us some money. If she had helped us when we walked in the door I would definitely had given them a 5-Star.

They also have privileged parking for expecting and new mothers. This is kool. Maybe Wal-Mart and Target should take up this idea 🤔? Hmm overall good first time experience my only suggestion is make sure the staff is not too busy stocking to help a wondering lost customer like me. 🤦🏾‍♂️🔥✅</review>

This visit was the nightmare and made me not to go back to this store again.I found  a problem what I purchased, which is a car seat. The base of the car seat was shaking too hard and the magnet(right side of the sitbelt) didn't detached to side. I asked one of the employee to exchange a new one and he said we have to contact to the manufacture department. They don't allow return/exchange items once the box
is opened.What? How do I find a problem once the box has not been opened? I wans't even wanted a return..Just wanted to have a right(has no problem) car seat. That was all.. So we walked out and called to the customer service and they said they can help me to make exchange my car seat.  He said just drop it off at any store near by and they'll send a new one. As soon as I got the return slip by email I went back to the store
show them the return slip and she gave me this funny face and said she is going to ask to the manager. She suddenly went to other cashier, talked someone on the phone and said "you can make replacement this time only!" . What an attitude she had..she was very annoying.This location employees doesn't know what they're doing and makes the store rules by own. I won't go back.</Review>

Horrible, horrible, horrible customer service!!! They do not stand behind the products that they sell. They are using covid-19 as a cop out saying, " we don't take Ret.  on many of their products because of covid-19". We had a brand new, unopened, with a receipt, baby monitor that they would not even exchange for a different one. They actually lied to us and said that the manufacturer would take it back, and gave us the manufacturers phone number. When we reach out to the manufacturer, they said they do not take returns. The manager, at the time, did not even want to hear or talk to us, she just said, abruptly, we don't take returns and walked away! I hope that they are happy with their customer policy, because we will never shop for our two children at Buy Buy Baby, nor will we recommend it for any of their birthdays as they grow up. We'll take our business to Target, Nordstroms,  and the many other retailers that stand behind what they sell, and where returns are never an issue.<//Text>

Today I came in to Buy Buy Baby in Torrance. To exchange a car seat base that came out defected. At first they said they couldn’t swap it. Then they wanted to sale me the one that they had in display. Then they said they would do an even exchange with the display one. All I wanted was an even exchange and a new one. I only used the car seat twice. I didn’t find it fair that they didn’t want to give me an even exchange. They tried to fix the one I brought in. But they couldn’t. Then sandy came to help me and I explained my situation. She seem to understand where I was coming from. So she decided to do an even exchange car seat with base. I was really pleased with her customer service. She came in heard me out. She processed it through her head and made a decision that made my wife and I happy. At the same time she kept me as a customer. Cause i am closer to the buy buy baby in Yorba Linda, but I like this store better. Thank you Sandy for your help.< /Text>

<text>Every visit I make to this location, the service that’s provided when ringing up my items is horrible. The cashiers are extremely rude. When there is a mislabeled price in an item (something that should be kept updated) they say it's labeled properly and we might have over looked it. They don’t even take the time to verify every price tag and label is updated or know how to accommodate for these mistakes. Definitely should send all the employees some sort of manner courses for better customer service.< /text><name>Noemi Molina</name><Gmap_id>0x80c2b4d49eef293b:0xad83ae3d15b6296e< /Gmap_id><user_id>109211561305270759027</user_id><date>1557027252662<//date>< rate>

They have coupons all the time, but exclude diapers, wipes, food, and some of the other high end brands. They do little mini sales on those products from time to time. The return policy is great and if you want them to price match amazon or walmart THEY WILL! It just has to be in stock and SAME BRAND.

<Text>This is definitely the worst customer experience I have had by far!! Sheri is a complete nightmare. I went to return something and amongst plenty of awful different replies the worst one was "Well we have the items on the floor couldn't you try it out before you bought it?" Well actually no Sheri I went to the store in Torrance AFTER work with my daughter near Downtown LA so I could not try it out. Once I realized she was just not helping out I asked for corporates number and her name (since she did not have her name tag on properly) and from that moment she completely changed her attitude and decided all of a sudden she was willing to do the return. By that time I just wanted to get out of there. So I told her that no I wanted to take the walker as well as corporates number and leave. And to my surprise she gave me the wrong number. Seriously? But whatever that's why there is google no Biggie.

Oh and to add to that, a store associate even approached me and told me that "sadly that is how she is" and apologized!!!! A STORE ASSOCIATE APOLOGIZED FOR HER MANAGERS BEHAVIOR"

THAT IS A FIRST!!

Avoid this place, apparently management doesn't care about our children's safety and this is not ok with me.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Everything you can imagine for baby needs. Staff is friendly and attentive, check in with you to see if you need help. Store organization could be labeled a bit more clearly, but it's not hard to find whatever you need.<//Review>

This place has tons of stuff for infants and great prices. The only complaint I have is that there is not a lot of clothing for infant or toddler boys. There is a vast selection for baby girls though.< /text>

Staff is knowledgeable and friendly. They also hold your merchandise for two weeks in case you need to pick up later.</Text></record>

Prices slightly unpredictable compared to similar stores (some lower, some higher). Nice selection on things like strollers. Plenty of parking.
Very liberal about coupons; Bed, Bath, and Beyond is the same corporation, so they take each other's coupons!< /review>

Good place to check out stuff for babies, but everything is pretty much at retail price so you can find same items on Amazon for cheaper. They also only accept non-expired coupons unlike sister-store bed bath and beyond.<//Text>

<rate>4</rate><Text>The plethora of items is fantastic! Its a sister store to Bed, Bath, & Beyond for pregnancy to pre-school. They do have a wide selection of items in-store & online, i prefer the store. All there items are stocked well & very visible, I have no issues walking down all the isles. Yes, I admit that its on the higher end as far as prices are concerned, but if I really need it, I  come here to get it. Some items are reasonably priced (i.e. lotion, shampoo). Overall, its a decent store to visit when looking for pre-baby/baby stuff. Enjoy your visit.<//Text>< pictures>

This store is extremely incompetent. The associates do not know the product and are not helpful. I had a great experience with the store in Mission Viejo but the Torrance store is a whole different story. They're hard to get ahold of when calling. I was constantly put on hold and then when waiting to be transferred to the furniture department I'm greeted again and asked how I can be helped... I've already told you how I can be helped! This happened about 5 times throughout the call. Very frustrating and the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Its a shame.< /review>

Majority of the staff just ignore you. They don't greet you when you come in. They don't seem to be happy at this establishment.</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I stopped by to look for baby products that are not sold or hard to find in Japan. I was surprised at the overwhelming selection of products. I found everything I was looking for. Since it is located in the Torrance area, it is highly recommended for Japanese tourists or local residents. The difficulty is that the products are displayed on fairly high shelves and cannot be reached by yourself, so you have to bring what you want to see or ask the clerk. I reduced the number of ★ by that amount, but apart from that, I am very satisfied. I would like to recommend it to the people around me.

日本では売ってない又はなかなか手に入らないベビー用品を探しに立ち寄りました。圧巻の品ぞろえでびっくりしました。探していたものがすべて見つかりました。トーランスエリアにあるので、日本人の観光客又は現地在住の方にぜひおすすめです。難点は、かなり高い棚にも商品が陳列されていて、自分の手では届かないので、はしご見たいなものを持ってくるか、店員さんにお願いしないといけない点です。その分★を一つ減らしましたが、それを除けばとても満足です。周りの人にもお勧めしたいです。</Text><time>1541747559801< /time>< Pictures>

They do it softly, so kids won´t get hurt. Their waiting area is beautiful.  Dr.To and everybody else there is so friendly.  If you get scared easily they will numb you and put you to sleep so you won´t feel anything. And also there is many shops to go to while you wait for your kid to finish. They make sure you will have a great time and has a toy box for kids. You can read books while your there and during Christmas the decor is fantastic. There is nothing Parklane Dental can´t do for your teeth. Great service and kind people. Would absolutely come again and I recommend you coming as well.</review></record>

<Review>Me and my wife had a really great experience here! The place is clean and they have a protocol to make sure that you are not sick upon coming in. They all are very sweet, kind, helpful and personal -they don't make you feel that you are just another customer but they are very friendly, we had good conversations with them and they would even go an extra mile to cater to your needs. Keep up the good work guys! Definitely recommend this place to everyone and will definitely go back.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

My son had his wisdom teeth taken out. We were told a time for the appointment and we waited for over an hour for his oral surgery. I was the person having to inquire as to why? No explanation, blah, blah. I finally shared with Grace, "If you knew the previous surgery was running overtime, why not give the patient a call?"  Also, I was quoted a certain amount of money by Grace which I brought in cash. When I arrived, she blasted me with an additional $249.00 which I placed on my credit card. The office staff is not friendly. Their rude. The surgeon never came out to greet .e before or after, so it's doubtful it was Dr. B and I was not impressed with the overall disorder and lack of cultural nuances of your supposed professional staff, including your dentists. I certainly will be sharing this information with my pediatric dentist. You should certainly invest some money 💰 in to teaching appropriate social skills.< /Review>

<text>I'm so happy and grateful 🙏 I took my husband to Parklane Dental to take care of some cavities, and he left very happy. The staff and the dr. Were so nice and careful. Maria the front office lady came often to the room to check on my husband!!! She is the best! 😆 my husband is so scared of needles but the amazing staff make him very comfortable. Now he can't wait to get a new cavity 🤭 thank you Dr. Tim and team!</text></record></dataset><record>

I've been going to Parklane for many years and last month was yet another Wonderful visit!!  I went for a clean up and Dr To and his team did an impeccable job!  Not only that, Dr To also took care of some gum irritation that I had and gave me a lot of great advice.   Highly, highly recommend Parklane.  Always a pleasure to visit.  Oh, I really, really like their lovely new office!< /Review>

<text>I had an absolutely wonderful experience at Parklane Dental. Anne helped me verify my insurance and got everything straightened out even though there were a few difficulties due to a recent change of insurance. From the moment I walked into the office I was greeted and treated with respect. The office is stunningly modern and beautiful. All of the staff are attentive and smiley, which makes me feel right at home. Dr. To gave me a friendly and thorough examination. The dental hygienist Amy did an amazing job cleaning my teeth, making sure that I was comfortable the entire time. At the end of the visit Grace explained the treatment plan to me in detail and made sure I was set for my future visits. Thank you Parklane Dental for helping me achieve my best smile.

<text>After being a client of this office for more than 7 years, I have got to say this is perhaps the worst experience I have ever had. The reception staff was cordial as usual, and the person that cleaned my teeth was exceptional and well detailed - I was actually very impressed up until the end when it came time for the doctor’s exam. Even though Dr. To is my Dentist and the fact that he personally performs my exam every time I have been here, I was provided an alternate dentist because Dr. To was with another patient. She starts off asking me if I had any concerns but the exam seemed to end right there????

Each time I am here, Dr. To ALWAYS goes over the x-rays with me and tells me the results. This doctor did no such thing. Didn’t even bother telling me her findings. If I am going to expose myself each time to radiation for x-rays at the very least giving me a briefing of the results is a standard practice don’t you think?

And then there’s the biggest question on everyone’s mind when you go to the dentist, "do I have any cavities?" With my visits with Dr. To, I don’t even have to ask this question, but with the alternate dentist I had to ask. Now if I did not think to ask would I be given this vital piece of information?

And because I tend to grind my teeth at night I use a mouth guard every night. Dr. To has always asked to check the condition of my mouth guard by placing it in my mouth to ensure that it has a proper fit and still works to protect my teeth - in fact there was even a time I forgot to bring in my mouth guard and he asked if I brought it. But I wasn’t even asked about it this time, the alternate examining dentist whisked through this exam so quickly that I even forgot to ask her to check the mouth guard for me. Whether it was checked or not it was unclear because this was not communicated to me during the exam.

Granted I was 5 minutes late for my appointment is an extra 2-3 minutes to show that you really care about patients by going over a few essential items that difficult? It’s not even the fact that I received an alternate dentist for my exam that bothered me but the way she conducted the exam that made me feel marginalized by the sheer speed of the exam and the lack of communication which made me feel as if I was being rushed out of there like cattle.

Sorry Parkland Dental, I normally have pleasant visits at your office but this visit was a sheer disappointment. I give this experience 2 Stars be cause essentially the experiences starts off with 5, but for each of the incidences that occurred I deducted 1 star, for those reason’s this visit yielded a 2 star rating.</text>< date>

I don't really write many reviews, but I had to make sure that I let everyone that is looking for a great dental office know that this place exist, I came in for a deep cleaning and Lysa took care of me, she was gentle and nice and had lots of patience. Scheduling is easy, when I called in Maria answered my call and accommodated me accordingly to the schedule. Grace made sure to take care of all of my insurance paperwork, which made it one less thing for me to worry about. Thank you Dr To for creating such an amazing place and for having such high standards. I liked this office so much I referred my brother here.< /text>

I have been coming here for about about 3 years. I am a big fan of this office - they have a great client experience and very accommodating. I had to make an appointment today but did not have time to take my dog home so pParklane Dental allowed me to bring my dog in and even took care of him while I got my cleaning. David took care of him the entire time. Thanks Park Lane!</Review>

I have been coming to Parklane Dental for years and every single visit is very pleasant and enjoyable. The every single staff member is very friendly and nice; they try to get to know you and provide a comfortable atmosphere. The cleaning and check ups are always thourough and helpful and they always give advice and suggestions on how you can further take care of your teeth. The place itself is very clean and modern and parking is easy to find.<//Text>

<text>This is one of the offices that I can honestly say will always take care of you, from when you walk in, they greet you with a smile, to when you leave, dr to explains everything step by step and the hygienist is gentle and thorough, never feel any pain the assistants are always making sure that the procedures go very smoothly. You will not be dissapointed when coming in.<//text><gmapID>0x80c2dbaf5b54797b:0x3e1fc92ddeb50cc3<//gmapID></record>

< review>
Not a good place for an extraction. Dentists here are so weak that they can't even pull out the tooth. I sat for a good hour as a 80 pound doctor yanked my head from side to side. in the end she said that it was "a sign I made the wrong choice."(couldn't afford root canal) I can't make this stuff up. Additionally, you will notice the administrators in the front as a lean up-selling machine. If you care what they charge to your insurance, this place is not worth the headache.</review>

Literally the best office in Southern California, I love it here, it's so nice and clean and spacious, it feels like you're at a spa when coming here, you have to see it. When you call the people that answer are so helpful, I absolutely recommend it.</text>

My last dentist is close to my home, and I picked him because of that.  However, he has so many patients, and he treated me like a number.  In n out pretty fast, and he even made a wrong diagnosis on me one time, luckily, my dental hygienist pointed out to him that I should not receive such treatment because of the nature of my tooth.  Then, my hygienist told me that's pretty basic stuff and she wondered why my dentist didn't recognize it.  My previous dentist is not paying attention, and that scares the heck out of me.  Now, I am with Dr. To, he is 40 miles away from my home, but that doesn't stop me from going because he is professional, caring, and he spends quality time with me and other patients (from what I observe).  Dr. To actually took time to clean my teeth and he only recommends the necessary treatment, never pressure me to do anything that is beyond my budget and needs.  I'd not hesitate to recommend Dr. To to my love ones!< /Text>
