<Name>Jaritza Andrea< /Name><Time>1623260850985< /Time><rate>5</rate><Text>I never write reviews, but I felt that the service tech team here really went above and beyond to fix my problems and make me feel welcomed. Within the first couple days, Chris helped me fix some minor issues I had. He was super polite, efficient and I really felt like he cared about getting the job done and did so as quickly as possible.

I also had the pleasure to meet Jerry and Carlos who were really nice and helped me find my way around the property.

Overall I am very happy, feel safe and feel like the team here really love and care for this place. The apartments are super cute and the amenities like the gym and pool are amazing. It's always clean, the landscape is super pretty and it feels calm and relaxing.< /Text>< pics>

<review>Recently I  had Chris V., John, and Carlos come by do maintenance repair at my unit and they were all fantastic. They came by at different times but they were always so  professional, proficient, kind and helpful. They came in and fixed the issues I was having with my sink, washer, and drains on the balcony. These guys are really on top of it. Thank you for your services. We appreciate them.

<review>Wow, I remember growing up in these apartments when I was a small child🥺 it’s good to see that there’s been upgrades. Nice apartments and spacious pool :) Hopefully one day I can come back!

Edit: just read the Yelp and google reviews and I wouldn’t want to live here...5 stars for the nostalgia. And back then (early 2000s)  the apartments were nice and no homeless or break-ins or roaches, not even pets were allowed.  Thanks to a hippie mayor & It seems from the reviews not so strict management, there seems to be a lot of problems with these once beautiful apartments. Hopefully this can be reversed.< /review><Resp>{'time': 1601572529220, 'text': "Hi, Leilani. We appreciate you taking the time to share this review.

< Review>
The management team/leasing office is very unprofessional in terms of package/delivery management.  During this COVID-19 pandemic, the management team failed to come up with an effective and responsible solution on package delivery which caused a lot of residences losing their packages. My package was delivered to the office and I swear I saw it placed inside of the office (right next to the door). But when I returned to pick it up during the office hour they lost my package and told me they never seen any packages for me. They started pushing responsibility to other team members by telling me they weren't here on the delivery day so they don't know anything and can't help me. I eventually lost my package because of this poor management and unprofessional response. I tried to reach them through email and asked them to provide a solution for my case, they completely ignore my email. This is a really bad practice. I'm very disappointed!< /Review>

The community is close to everything!  I'm attending a Language school near by and I will say that the staff really helped me with finding everything close by.  They listened and helped me find an apartment that I love.  The best part is that there is a market, restaurant, and bus close by.  The bus is very important to me since I do not have a car.< /review>

<Text>They shut off the water without any warning several times a week.  The place is constantly under construction with rude workers who literally yell at you to "TAKE THE ELEVATOR!!!!".  If someone parks in your assigned space, it can take hours to get them to move.  Since there is zero street parking, you just have to go somewhere else for all that time.  The gate to the parking garage will break in the closed position trapping you in the garage for hours.  The floors are uneven in the apartments.   There is literally no reason to live here.  You have been warned.<//Text>< Pics>

Besides the frequent maddening and disruptive middle-of-the-night intrusion and the useless mandatory vendor inspections to supposedly investigate/fix the problem, the real danger comes in the event of a genuine emergency: no one is taking the alarm seriously anymore, no one bothers to get out of bed to investigate, the residents are now assuming it's a false alarm by default.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>For people who are consider moving into this apt, BE AWARE of what you are getting into!!!!

The pictures I uploaded show what my studio room looks like right now. They are installing washing machine and dryers in my room. The project, as they claim, is gonna take 6-8 weeks or even longer. The half of the room is gone, covered by white plastic sheets. The entire closet is gone, the AC is not usable (oh wonderful summer), there’s dirt on the floor, and even more, part of the floor is removed (nice view to the pk lot since I’m on the first floor). I talked to the management and asked how and why am I gonna live and work in this place for the next 2 months with my $1,700 rent/month. Basically, they believe that since I signed a contract says that they are gonna have this project, so they can do whatever they want and I just have to suck it up. The manager told me the contract never specifies anything b/c anything could happen during the construction. I asked what if now you tell me that the construction is gonna take a YEAR, and the manager told me “YES IT COULD.” Then I asked about having worker in and out freely for the next two months. He told me that they have already notified me the date when the project initially started (by dropping a paper notice at my front door and sending out general email about the project), they are just allowed to have access to my apt. I asked for more specific scheduled dates, and he said there is no way we could project when the workers are gonna be in my room.   At the end I said what about I will give some suggestions. The managers said impatiently that “I think we’re good here. I don’t want to argue with you. We have done our best.” I said again so you don’t wanna hear my suggestions and he repeated what he just said a couple times. I asked for if there is any higher management people I could talk to, but he refused to give any.

For this apt, they think if you said yes on the contract, they can do ANYTHING they want. They don’t care about the residents. Another example is that when I first rented this place, I didn’t move in for the first month but I had furniture and some stuff in the room. Then on the day when I actually moved in, I opened the door, I saw dirt everywhere, three wholes on the floor that I could see through the pk lot, the balcony door was wide open, and the lights and fan were on. Then I figured out that construction workers were in about a week ago and my apt was like this for an entire week. Then I attempted to communicate to the manager (same guy) for so many times. I asked for $20 refund of my electricity bill for that month and it took me 2 months to do that.

So please think through it before you move in. When they claim that everything is good for the residents, they are the one who’s getting the true benefit eventually. They are allowed to do renovation while having people paying for the room at the same time. They will raise the rent after having new equipment in the room. Smart deal. I’m paying $1,700/month to live in a construction area for the next two months. And who’s what’s gonna happen during construction. It could take A YEAR.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>Super experience from the first call I made. The entire process took approximately three weeks. The leasing agent Omuri was courteous, attentive, and welcoming. Moving in was a breeze. Thank you for letting us use your cart to haul my stuff.... Thank you for taking care of my maintenance needs, Jason you have an awesome team. I had a list of 10 properties I was interested in. Although, I've been at the property a short time, I am glad I chose Hampshire Place.
My +++: professional staff, great location to shopping and transit stations, earth friendly landscape, cool amenities, and quiet neighbors thus far....
My ---: zip zero, nada, for now...< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c77b51b65579:0xf4de2098477b8e9</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

ATTENTION! Be really careful! My apartment just got robbed!!!! I moved to a studio here by the end of September 2016 by myself. My apartment is on the first floor, so I always lock my door and close the curtain. I left on the Feb 4th, which is a Saturday. When I came back around midnight on Feb 10th, I found out that my apartment got robbed. I called the police right away and they came. The police officer couldn't tell how the thefts came in. The door of the patio was bent, so it seemed that they came in from the patio. After what happened, the company said that the only thing they can do is to change the lock of my door and no one can guarantee your safety. That's really irresponsible and cruel. So be really really careful when you pick a place to live.< /Text>

<userid>106307879283698051861</userid><text>After seeing a listing on Craiglist in December of 2016, I proceeded to view an apartment at Hampshire Place Apartments (501 S. New Hampshire Los Angeles, CA 90020) that was listed by the leasee for sublease. After viewing the apartment I was taken to the leasing office to complete a rental application. During the application process I was told that I was being added to the current leaseholders lease and would not have my own lease to ensure an 'easier approval.' I was told that I was approved. Upon arriving at the apartment I found homeless squatters in the underground parking facility. The unit also had roaches. I complained to the leasing office and after 2 nights, decided and informed the leasing department that I did not want to stay here. When speaking with a manager I was told that they were ok with releasing me from the lease because it was done incorrectly by adding me to the current leaseholders lease instead of giving me my own. He said this was done by the leasing agent to ensure easy approval because he said my credit and income did not qualify for the apartment on my own. I turned in my keys and vacated the premises. While applying for a new apartment I was alerted about this judgement by my new prospective landlord. My application has been declined pending resolution of this issue.

I have called the apartment complex (Hampshire Place) three times. I have submitted a request via Equity Residential's website. I have called the Equity Residential Los Angeles office and left a message. I have called the Equity Residential HQ in Chicago and was transferred to a customer relations number. I left a message at customer relations. Of all of these touch points I have not received any contact back in regard to my issue. I have never received a bill, correspondence, court summons, or anything pertaining to this matter. It was a complete surprise.

UPDATE:
After some calling to the property management company, I was responded to by a regional manager, Robert Sherman in their Los Angeles office. Robert was very courteous and efficient in getting my problem solved. He was very apologetic on behalf of his organization and even called my new prospective landlord to ensure this was done in error, so that I could move forward with my new lease.

While the issue was frustrating, Robert Sherman's honesty, accountability, and efficiency in handling the matter restored my faith in the parent company of this apartment complex.

In 90 days I will update again to ensure all things were removed from credit and stay gone. Thank you again to Mr. Sherman for handling this issue expeditiously.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmap_id>0x80c2c77b51b65579:0xf4de2098477b8e9</gmap_id>< response>

We're always happy to discuss concerns or questions you may have so please feel free to reach out at any time. Thank you so much!"}<//Response><review>First and foremost, NO ROACHES OR HOMELESS INVASIONS! I had my concerns after reading the old posts, but then realized that the most recent poor review was over a year ago. I have been living here for several month now and have seen none of these old concerns. I have also been very happy to find that all of the employees here, from the leasing office, to the security guards and maintenance, are all incredibly friendly and great at their jobs. Either when I call the leasing office or email them, my questions are answered within 24 hours.Security is vigilant all night, and they have recently placed better gates in to keep out unwanted individuals. The gate for the parking lot works great and is conveniently placed on a road that has no traffic, so getting in and out is never an issue.
Moving on to the actual apartment, the videos did NOT do it justice. It hasn't been renovated in some time, but everything in the kitchen seems new and everything works great. I went for one of the studio apartments and it is HUGE. They could have put up a wall and turned it into a small 1 bedroom. More closet space than was in my old 3 bedroom apartment in New York City. There are also many areas to wash and dry cloths located around the complex, positioned so that no unit is more than several doors down from your washer/drier. The pool area is beautiful and the pool/hot-tub are great. Pool is heated to a comfortable cool at all times and hot-top has a comfortable bathing heat to it. Foliage is also lovely. The BBQ area could use some renovation, but there are 4 and they all work, there is never an issue to wait to use the BBQ's. I am very into fitness, so I find the fitness area to be lacking a bit for my needs, but there are multiple running and cardio machines and weight machines, that work just fine for a quick workout. All in all, I feel like I'm living at a vacation resort with the amenities.
I'm a first-year dental resident, and find the other tenants to be very friendly and happy with their units as well. It is never too loud in the pool area and I have never had issues with noise at night. Everyone is very respectful of each other and I have heard of and seen no issues with my fellow tenants. I hope this review helps to appropriately off-set the old bad reviews. I'm not sure if they have changed management or just gotten things together, because this place is great!</review><username>Andrew Palermo<//username>< Date>

THis place is the worse experience I had in LA.  I had lived in three different places in a span of 2 years after I got a job.  This place was very welcoming and professional at first since they want you to move.  First day I moved in, the sink started leaking around 7PM.  the water leaked all over the kitchen area and no one was able to be reached to get them to come out until next morning.  THe water was black.  There were instances of loud fire alarm going off at 2 am in the morning 4 times in my stay of 6 months.  At the end of the lease, i gave them one month notice over the phone 3 times and a letter like it requires yet received no response and when i finally went to go meet them at the office, they come with all the charges like 30 day notice was not given.  They wanted me to pay extra 15 days of rent until they find a new tanent.  That cost me extra 1000.  this place is joke.  all they care about is money.  sometimes i would come home and feel like someone has been in my apartment without my knowledge.  great feeling i am out of this place.<//text>

<Text>I was referred to Dr Joey from a friend, but I also looked up reviews and everything everyone shared was essentially the same-  that hes absolutely amazing. I took my 3.5 daughter for her 1st appointment today and my first impression was "wow, the staff and dental assistant are super happy, welcoming, and they were very attentive to my daughter and trying very hard to give her the best experience- which worked like a charm!! She was given a princess crown, bracelets, rings, Mickey stickers and I was even more impressed on how excited she was to be in the room next to the "tools." I was even impressed on how they walked me through this experience with her and they explained everything to me; how they work, their approach to working with her, and they ease her into getting her teeth cleaned. Definitely recommend this doctor and office and I am really excited to take her to her next appointment!! Stop your search and book an appt asap!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

They do an awesome job with my almost 4 year old son, Ryder.  The whole staff is very friendly.  We see Dr. Joey and he is so nice and welcoming.  I love that they work hard to make sure it’s an enjoyable experience.  My son left today happy and excited for his next visit to the dentist!  Love it.< /Text>

You will not find a more personable, kind and genuine dentist in him.  You can tell he loves what he does and knows how to work with children.  Our three kids love Dr. Joey and look forward to seeing him.  It is a testament to how good he is with children.  All three kids, started coming here around the age of 4 and never had a negative view about going to the dentist.  Thank you Dr. Joey and Oak Park Dentistry for creating this experience for the kids.  Fear of going to the dentist is so foreign to them, but they hear it all the time from their cousins :)< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Everyone at this office is amazing. We have seen a couple of different doctors in the Simi office and they are all truly great. Dr. Joey is so friendly and puts the kids at ease. The office is busy so you definitely have to schedule your visit in advance but when you get there you feel 100% taken care of. Love OPD!< /Text>< pictures>

<review>This is THE place to bring your child for warm, caring and safe dental care. We were greeted with lots of happy energy and taken care of if we were family. My daughter is 2 and not a fan of sitting in the dental chair, yet. Cheryl and Dr. Joey are professional and work great with kids and I know my daughter will look forward to her next visit. I left with helpful information to take care of of my child’s teeth and she walked out with a big, clean, smile - proudly swinging her goody bag in hand. Thank you oak park dentistry - wood ranch. I highly recommend this office to anyone in need of pediatric dental care!< /review>< pics>

<Review>My two kids and I had a wonderful experience at Oak Park Dentistry in Simi. Every staff member was friendly and attentive to my two very social children. The hygienists helped my kids to feel at ease and they answered every question and made my kids feel seen and heard. Dr. Alami is always friendly and engaging as well. He was professional and explained to each of them what was going on and made them feel very much a part of their appointment. Everyone is always very uplifting and they help make dental care fun. My kids are excited to go back in 6 months!!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80e82ee156bae9c9:0x692b2396d14fba04< /GmapID></record>

Every visit is a joy! Such a wonderful team of professionals, really kid-friendly, supportive and knowledgeable. I trust them 100% when it comes to my kids’ dental health!
Of note, though, Oak park dentistry IS expensive.. maybe it’s my insurance problem, maybe it’s the place (likely the place, because my own and husbands adult dental payments are not anywhere near as high as what I pay for my kids’ dental work). But! I never have to struggle with getting my kids into the office for any type of dental work! And that, for me personally, outweighs the cost. So, definitely check with them about the costs before you decide to visit the office.< /text>

What a great experience for my 3 year old son and I had at Oak Park dentistry. The staff was beyond excellent. Especially dental assistant Norma, who made my son's experience, so easy and more important, no pain. 🦷 Norma made my son's experience fun and educational at the same time. I as a parent, I thank her, for her professionalism and courtesy on our visit. Dentist Joey was beyond skillful on handling my son's teeth 😬 Again, thank you to the staff at Oak Park dentistry.<//text>

I have been bringing my children to Oak Park Dentistry  for 14 years, and continue to do so even after we moved out of the area. Everyone is so nice, and the care they give is unmatched. Would recommend to anyone looking for experts that truly make you feel like family.</review>

Their great. Literally do everything to keep your toddler comfortable and ok during every procedure.  Not proud to say my 4 year old had to have a pretty deep filling and also one tooth pulled. But they were SO QUICK and did such a great job he healed super fast and didn't even hesitate about going to his next appointment.
Thats UNHEARD OF. SERIOUSLY WHAT KID GETS A BACK TOOTH PULLED AT 4 AND IS TOTALLY COOL HEADING BACK TO THE DENTIST FOR A FILLING??
They obviously set the bar for pediatric dentistry and I am so greatful i chose them after asking all the moms in my area who I should go to .</Review>

What an amazing Children’s dentist!
The staff here are what really make the experience next level. They are so sweet and fun with the kids, making it something to look forward to rather than dread. My 5 and 3 year old love getting little prizes, and stickers at the end of their visit.
They make sure to explain everything they are doing and make it a point to answer all questions. 10/10</Text>

I have taken my 2 girls to Oak Park Dentistry in Simi Valley since they were young and they are teens now. It has been a pleasure to visit them for cleanings, cavities and sealants. All the ladies there are wonderful and Dr. Joey is great! 😊<//Text>

<name>Jessica Hernandez<//name><pics>None<//pics><review>My 2 year old had her 2nd appointment this morning and just like our very first time, the visit was amazing. I love the decor of the office, it’s such a warm and inviting feel for the parents and for the kids (plenty of toys to play with while waiting to be seen.) The front office staff are very friendly and accommodating. Our assistant was so sweet to my little girl, made her feel special by making it a big deal we were there. Dr. Joey is such a professional and fun dentist. His energy is positive and encouraging. My little one was very nervous, obviously but he made her smile and giggle. She opened her mouth long enough to let him count her teeth and sing wheels on the bus. That is a feet in itself, she never wants me to brush her teeth for her. I, as the parent felt pretty special too. Dr. Joey complimented me on the part I have in taking care of my daughters teeth. He also explained everything that was going on with her teeth, what we should expect to happen and advice on how to perfect our home care. Overall, Oak park are doing a spectacular job.

Side note: Love them so much that I’m bringing my 1 year old for the first peek a boo appointment next week.<//review><Rating>5</Rating></record>

<review>Thank God for this dentist's office. If you have an autistic child, go here. Don't bother elsewhere. We tried others places for years that claimed they worked with special needs kids, and it always ended it frustration and in one case, trauma. My son barely talks but has told multiple people within 1 day that Oak Park "is good dentist." I(you have a special needs kid with speech delay, that's *Extraordinary*!)<//review></record></dataset><record>

If I could give Oak Park Dentistry more than 5 stars I would!!

I brought my nervous 4 1/2 year old in for a cleaning and she hasn’t stopped asking me when we can go back to the dentist!

Let’s start with the decor. The exterior windows of the office are colorfully painted with their Alligator mascot so the moment we parked our car my daughter knew the place was going to be fun (not scary). There is an artificial life sized tree at the check in counter complete with ‘sleeping’ stuffed bears. The lobby has huge play area with a playhouse, table with games, Lego wall and too many toys to list. There is a tree house filled with ‘animals’ hanging from branches in the outer exam area. They use colorful tie-dyed x-ray protection bibs and fun crazy sunglasses to ‘protect’ little eyes from the bright light of the dental lamp.

Every single person at the office is warm and friendly and engages the kids along with the parents at every stage of the appointment.

There are stickers and prizes galore throughout the visit with an emphasis on educating little ones on dental health in a positive and encouraging way.

There is simply no other dental office that I will ever take my daughter to again. Oak Park has earned a patient for life!< /review>

It was great. We always go there for regular dental cleanings but today my daughter had sealants. The experience was terrific. The hygienist showed her what they would do before they did. She took breaks as she needed and they were very patient. It was a very good experience and we will definitely stay at Oak Park Dentistry for Children.<//text>

We have been coming here for over 3 years. We had changed from another children’s dentist in Simi and we are so glad we did. The staff is wonderful and on top of everything. There are no issues and they make a point to tell you everything up front. They are great with the kids and it is a fun and calming environment for children. We see Dr. Joey and he had been nothing but wonderful. Even when my kids are not doing their best on brushing and flossing ( cause they have braces), he lets them know and is very kind in reminding them how important it is. My kids love coming to the dentist and there are times I wish they were my dentist. I highly recommend them!!< /text>

<text>Amazing experience! My 2 year old daughter was comfortable, happy, and didn’t want to leave. The staff and hygienists were sweet and very helpful. Dr. Alami was able to make both my daughter and I feel at ease and he explained everything so well. My daughter talked about the dentist all day today to pretty much anyone who would listen. Can’t wait till our next visit and until my 2 week old daughter can be a patient as well. 5 stars for sure!</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

They were so gentle and caring. They had to redo work done by another local dentist...They were just amazing with my 7-year old daughter. I am so blessed to have found them. From care to billing, everyone is just unbelievably great!! Thank you to the entire office staff...the dentists are all top quality and well trained professionals that care....Bella wants to be a dentist when she grows up 💕</Text>

My 4.5 year old son is very sensitive and has been going to see doctor Joe and his hygienist since he was 2. My son has become extremely comfortable with them and the tools required for dentistry. They truly have it down on how to treat children and you can feel how much they care! They are out of network for our dental insurance but we still choose them. Highly recommend!<//review>

Dr. Alami and his staff consistently make our dental office visits a positive experience for me and my children.  We love the whole atmosphere there!  They are all very prepared, organized, kid friendly, and always nice and polite.  They comfort kids with pillows and blankets, give sunglasses for the bright lights, provide movie glasses, encourage good hygiene habits, and are fun to talk to.  They show interest in our lives and have a great sense of humor.  They boost our morale with compliments.  They give fantastic incentives which motivates the children to brush and floss regularly.  As a parent, I appreciate all of this so that my children actually look forward to going to their cleanings.  I also appreciate that the doctor takes a conservative approach to certain cavities.  If the doctor discovers a cavity on a baby tooth and it is a minor spot, he discusses it with us and is very aware about watching it, instead of aggressively suggesting he drill it.  Overall, we can't say enough great things about Oak Park Dentistry and highly recommend them to all we know!< /review>

<review>My girls left in tears. One was fine, she was only upset that while they were cleaning her teeth they didn’t offer the water rinse thing and they got cleaning stuff all over her face, but the other really gets nervous at the dentist always has, so she was upset and was crying through the whole visit. Finally when I left they charged me for stuff my dentist doesn’t charge for. I even asked ahead to please check before they did extra procedures. Anyhow, the staff was nice, but I wouldn’t recommend this place nor will I be going back.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I don't think there are enough positive words that can describe the experience my daughters have continually had at Oak Park Dentistry. I have a 4 year old and a 6 year old. Every time I tell them that it's time to go to the dentist, they are excited to go! As a parent, I couldn't be happier about this. Every single person on staff is kind, professional, knowledgeable, and have such a positive attitude when we get there. The staff is highly educated and have helped to promote a positive dental health program with my children. As a mom, I have done so as well. But as we all know, often our children listen to others advice more than ours. They have a positive nurturing way to fix any issue.  I would 100% recommend anyone to go to Oak Park Dentistry.</text>

< Review>
I don't think there are enough positive words that can describe the experience my daughters have continually had at Oak Park Dentistry. I have a 4 year old and a 6 year old. Every time I tell them that it's time to go to the dentist, they are excited to go! As a parent, I couldn't be happier about this. Every single person on staff is kind, professional, knowledgeable, and have such a positive attitude when we get there. The staff is highly educated and have helped to promote a positive dental health program with my children. As a mom, I have done so as well. But as we all know, often our children listen to others advice more than ours. They have a positive nurturing way to fix any issue.  I would 100% recommend anyone to go to Oak Park Dentistry.< /Review>

By far the most amazing experience ever. I can't stress enough how wonderful they are. UPDATE 3/3/17: took my son to his first visit and they totally eased his fears. He was terrified to go and they made it easy. I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! A DENTAL GODSEND.</Review>

<review>I love this dentistry place! Dr. Joey and his staff are incredible and have done a terrific job making my daughter feel great during her visits to the dentist. They sing the ABCs when they clean her teeth, give her awards, etc and more importantly they keep her teeth in check and clean! Highly recommend it.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><rate>5</rate>< UserId.>

Couldn't say enough good things about this dentist office!  Every visit the staff is personable, professional and friendly.  My son got his braces off last year and his teeth look beautiful.  My daughter just recently had her top braces put on and we are waiting for the bottom.  Always trustworthy and do not try to talk you into unnecessary  procedures or costs.  They always let the parents sit with their kids during the procedures.  Five plus stars!< /review>

It was our very first visit to the dentist and I don't think I could have asked for more. My 2.5 year olds felt very comfortable with the staff. Dr. Alami took time giving us feed back and the dental hygienists were gentle, fun and kept the girls engaged. We are very pleased with our choice.< /review>

WE LOVE KLUB K9!!!! We were recommended by a close friend to bring our pup Bentley there for daycare and he absolutely loves it. We are happy dog parents bringing him here because the owner and his team genuinely care about the health and safety of our dogs and treat them like their own. They're super knowledgeable and really take the time to be with your dogs and constantly check to make sure they're okay(they also have handlers that constantly look over the dogs in each play area) ! It makes me feel so good and they definitely mean a lot to me and my little family!< /Text>

Incredible staff here! Such a deep knowledge of dogs and how they think! I was so completely impressed with Charles advice. I started to try some simple things with our puppy Annie and she was much more obedient. I am so grateful that Annie can be in such great care here! Thank you again Charles. You are amazing!!!!! I couldn’t believe how well our puppy listened to you and loved you!!! So grateful for all the time you took to get to know our puppy and amazed at how you handled the other dogs there too!</text>

Took my dog there just for the temperament evaluation and already loved the place. The owner and the other guy (with the beard) were very friendly and tried to interact with my dog the whole time being extremely nice. They seem to be people that genuinely like and care about dogs, and also experts. They understand that dogs are dogs and how their instincts work. I was amazed when they told me the reason for the drop off times. I always feel like dog hotels are usually trying to rip you off and not really caring about the dogs and the fact that they miss their families. Klub k9 gave me a completely different impression, with fair prices and a positive attitude. I'm very happy I found them. Thanks for making the difference :)</Text>

<text>This is such a great place for dogs. My dog Charlie loves to go there. He is so excited every morning and cannot wait to go there and play. The folks are super nice and professional. The whole facility is very clean. I can only highly recommend this place - especially if you have an active dog that is bored at home while the owner is at work. They put a lot of emphasis on vaccinations and behavior so it is safe for all dogs.< /text>< Pictures>

Brought our puppy there for their puppy social. He developed kennel cough from Klub K9. Since puppies don't have all their shots, we thought that Klub K9 would be a safe place where he wouldn't get sick....WRONG!! After this, I heard Klub K9 was shut down previously due to dog flu.< /review>

{'time': 1561677141429, 'text': 'Sorry to hear that your puppy got kennel cough. For the puppy social event, we will deep clean the area one night before and lock it down until the puppy social starts. We also require the puppy owners not to bring their puppy to dog parks or the other puppy socials to try to avoid fleas or the other virus such as kennel cough. Unfortunately not every owner listens to us.\n\nYes, I deiced to shut down for Canine Influenza H3N2 in January of 2018. The influenza hit California in December of 2017. Before  that it had never been in California. Prior to the outbreak veterinarians did not carry the vaccine for the H2N3 influenza. Due to the fact that it had never been to California.\n\nDuring the Christmas holiday we close daycare due to high volume of overnight boarding dogs. During this time we had no cases of any kind of sickness including influenza. Shortly after the holiday we opened back up for daycare dogs. We had a dog enter for daycare who was in the beginning stages of the flu. According to our vet a dog will be infected and contagious for typically 7 days prior to showing any symptoms of influenza. Unfortunately high tech glasses that make germs visible to the human eye have not been invented yet. Through the process of elimination we determined which dog was the original dog who brought it into our facility. The owner confessed he had been taking him to a dog park to burn off energy while our daycare was closed. And we can\'t blame him dogs need exercise, and he certainly couldn\'t see any germs on his dog either. The same goes for our puppy social. We try our best to make sure everyone is up to date with vaccines, but its really up to the owner and their veterinarian to make sure they are protected.\n\nLet me be clear we where never "shut down" by anyone, I chose to close. The reason I deiced to shut down was try to break the infection chain. I think it was clearly a better option, rather than  staying opening and getting more dogs sick. The two weeks I shut down caused me to directly lose $90,000, but I believe it\'s worth to keep dogs safe.\n\nWe try to be as safe as possible here. Personally my vet vaccinated all my puppies at 8 weeks for Distemper, parvovirus and bordetella aka kennel cough. I would imagine any vet you talk to about joining a puppy social would strongly recommend getting bordetella prior to attending, as that vaccine covers the most common strains of kennel cough. However unfortunately less common strains do exist that are not covered by the bordetella vaccine. And lets face it no vaccine is perfect. People who get flu shots occasionally get the flu.\n\nWe have a very stringent cleaning process here to ensure people have a clean, safe and fun place for their puppies to come and socialize and burn off energy while learning basic social skills. We urge all owners to discuss vaccines and when to get them with their veterinarian. We highly recommend having Distemper, parvovirus and bordetella prior to joining any kind or canine gathering or social to help keep them safe.\nThanks,\nKlub K9'}</resp>

If I could give Klub K9 Play Center 10 stars I would. Excellent customer service and excellent care for my dog are what make them my choice for my dog's care. Klub K9's staff are always polite and top notch. If you're looking for boarding or daycare this is the place!</Text>

<review>Been bringing my lab puppy since he was 10wks old - he loves it! He is totally socialized & great around other dogs because of the good “upbringing” he’s had here. The staff are all friendly & happy to answer any questions you have. We have many people bringing dogs from our company (our office is right around the corner) and it’s a perfect spot with great hours. Yay for Klub K9!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>Want your dog to be out of a cage and able to play while you're gone? This is a great place, keeping the dogs in large open areas all day and night. They separate only for feeding.

Mike and the staff are good with dogs. Mike may be a bit on the strict side, e.g. drop off times and how he runs the place. But it keeps the dogs calm and a good stay is worth it IMHO.

Prices aren't bad for this level of human attention and dog freedom. Klub K9 is now my default choice. Oh, and I have a little 15 pound Dachshund - glad to see him get along so well with larger dogs.

Web cams aren't as nice the the previous place I used, though. Not as much coverage (dogs out of sight), and poor video quality (jerky, more like frequent postcards instead of video).< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< user_name>

Great staff.  They really care about dogs as individuals and take great care of them.

The weekly free Puppy Socials are a great way to get your pup socialized with other dogs, and Mike and Jackie do a great job educating the parents on dog behavior at the same time.

Totally recommend this place.<//Text>

Our dog has been here for daycare and boarding hundreds of times since he was a small puppy. He loves it. The owner Mike and staff truly understand and love dogs. The rules are strict, which means I trust that everyone's dogs are properly vaccinated and socialized, not just mine. On the rare occasion when I've really needed an exception to the rules (unexpected overnight stay due to medical emergency, for example) Mike has always accommodated. When our baby was nearly due, Mike let us drop our dog off any time 24/7, and gave us some info and a free miniature class on introducing dog to baby. We learned dog training from the puppy kindergarten class here, and it has stuck through his life. Love this place!<//Text>

<review>If I could give this place zero stars, I certainly would.  They are TERRIBLE.  My dogs stayed there over Thanksgiving a few years ago.  I got a message on my cell phone that Saturday that there was an issue with my dog.  I tried calling back all the next day to no avail - no one would answer.  Imagine getting a call that there is an issue with your dog and then not being able to reach anyone about it.  Well, long story short but my dog had a huge gash all over his face (he's a Lab so he's a big dog anyway but the gash took over one side of his face).  Apparently the "accident" happened on Wednesday and they didn't call me until Saturday.  Are you freaking kidding?!  Not only that when my husband picked up our dog they wouldn't show him where the "accident" happened due to insurance purposes.  Yeah right.  Mike the owner is terrible.  I posted photos of my dog on Yelp.  I would never ever leave any dog there again.<//review>< rating>

We found this place from their free puppy social and now take our dog here for daycare and boarding. Prices are competitive and our dog loves going there.</Text>

I needed some important documents signed by UPS and E-mailed. I'm a busy guy so time is super important. They were super busy at this time and insisted I come back in 2 hours and he would have all the paperwork signed, everything completed. I came back and it was all ready to go, no hassles, no waiting in long lines. The staff are very professional and kind. Hard to see how people give this place bad reviews. Maybe improper packaging causing extra fees maybe. Their supplies cost fees to pack your packages if you don't do it right yourself and I understand business wise it cost them money to buy these supplies.</Text>

<Text>Employee's have always treated me well. I usually go in just to drop off packages, in which I have labeled and ready to go. There are times I go in and I'm not sure where to leave my package, so I leave it on the floor next to counter. That being said the only thing I would recommend is having a specific drop of section for customers. This way customers can come in leave their package and head on out. Overall this a great store and I recommend coming to this location.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1606929501521, 'text': "Hi Adrian,\nThanks for sending us your kind review & we're glad to take in your recommendation for the drop-off spot in our store.

DO NOT RETURN AMAZON PACKAGES HERE.  I know it is convenient but these guys do not deserve your business.  I had two boxes to ship back to amazon. I bought two air purifiers and no longer needed them, so i selected the option to return at UPS "No label needed."  I didn't even unbox these items, they were returned to the UPS store same as I received them.  So they scan my return code and it prints up one label.  They then try to tell me I need to tape the two boxes together, or they can do it for .75¢... I say, you are a shipping store you should have tape for this, and you need maybe .05¢ of tape, and I'm sure Amazon is paying you to receive these packages.  And they refused to accept both packages.  Could I have paid the 75 cents and made better use of my time than going to another UPS store?  Absolutely, but then I wouldn't have been so inspired to write a scathing review urging any Amazon customer to not use them.  They are trying to rip off customers and not provide good customer service, which Amazon is known for.  They will forever lose my business, and I hope to drive UPS business somewhere else.< /review>

<Review>I know sometimes places get really busy and we have to wait, but waiting for the quality of service here is WORTH IT!! Other stores like the one in Downey on Firestone, they give terrible service and do their jobs wrong, and will charge you for fixing their own error!

But in this place, people are honest, and they will NOT steal your money like other places!

These people at this location are reliable, honest, have integrity, and will always give you great service!

COME TO THIS STORE and NOT THE ONE IN DOWNEY!! I have now been coming here for the past 5 years, and they give great honest service you can COUNT ON!!!< /Review><UserId.>106344456451801250687<//UserId.><Response>{'time': 1603039805452, 'text': "Hi Maritza,\n\nWe're thankful for your appreciation & we love to keep serving you and all customers the Best way we could :-)!"}<//Response>< gmapID>

I've been coming to this UPS store since I used to ship my xbox back for fixes as a kid. Ilde and his team run the best store anywhere, hands down. The service is polite and professional, and even with the insane business of COVID they've been holding it down and getting things done. Love this store and would recommend it to anyone with shipping, printing or notary needs.< /text>

Worst UPS store. Better off at FedEx. I’m not spending my money at any UPS ever again. Printed out 6 pages at this store and the guy said $4.50. I didn’t even want 4 of the pages. I only needed 2. So I told him I don’t want this 4 pages throw them away. He said I’d still have to pay for all. What a rip off. I promise you fedex would’ve let me off at no charges and if they do charge it’s never more than $2 for printing. This guys are also slow and unprofessional. I wanted to mention the guy that helped me but they don’t have name tag/badge. It’s a rip at this store.<//Text>

Rude, rude rude. I Stood In line for a little over 30 minutes, which is no problem. The issue for me is when I got to the front counter I was greeted by a woman saying “what do you need” that is the rudest way to greet a customer. Needless to say I will not return to that location.

*Also I believe the drivers break the box is open to see if it’s anything they would like to steal. every single time I receive a package from UPS it Has been opened.</Review>

< Review>
Great Customer Service!  I have been coming here for several years now.
I have sent many packages to England, Utah and Wisconsin. The person that has taken care of me is probably the owner, he personally makes sure that all my paper work is completed. Today I had to e-scan some documents and he was there to help me with the process, actually he did it all. Thank You for taking the time ! I will definitely come back and use this UPS store located in Bellflower CA.< /Review>

<review>I needed a Notary ASAP and not only were they available, but they also took care of what I needed done in a timely manner.  I was in and out of the store very quickly.  They were friendly and took care of their customers.  I will definitely go back for any Notary work and highly recommend it to others who need something notarized.</review>< pics>

I am happy to use this facility again. The facility is clean, has everything I needed to send a package, the service was prompt, friendly and pricing was very reasonable. If you want honest prices, friendly service, and want your package to be safe, this is the place to go. I HIGHLY recommend this UPS store. Thanks you Bellflower UPS on Lakewood Blvd. You guys are wonderful! From: Wendy</text>

{'time': 1562896056083, 'text': "It is sad & disturbing that M V (as she complained to HQ that I used her name, & I hope the letters M V don't mean Most Vindictive)  is distorting facts in this review about our store.  She only listens to what she wants to hear about what I had to say. It's the reason why she said I slipped a legitimate charge of $2 as packaging service fee for her 3 shipments (2 drop-offs & 1 shipping).  How was it deceptive when she spent so long in reading & meticulously scrutinizing the parcel shipping order, but missing out the valid service fee on her receipt?  Upon recent review, both documents Ms. M V affixed her signatures on; makes us wonder if she understood what she carefully read before signing them prior to leaving our store.  When she phoned that she would dispute the $2 with her credit card company, I called her several times but was left unanswered, hence I emailed her that I'd rather return her shipment & refund her the shipping cost lest I end up getting charged back.  She appeared at the store later, got her shoe box & refund, tongue-lashed me & hustled a couple of customers outside :-(.\n\n+++UPDATE+++ Thanks for updating your review, M V.  We cannot choose the kind of customers coming to us & if you're claiming to be the easiest customer to deal with, then we respect you for that belief of yours.  We have the right to protect our business, especially from people like you who think that you're always right, perfect, and that there's nothing wrong with you.

<review>VINDICTIVE, CROOKED,  PETTY, AND UNETHICAL PEOPLE! REPORT THEM TO BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU!! Read all of the negative comments and their response and you will see the kind of people you are dealing with! Do not go to this UPS location. The manager there is very rude and short with you. He also will slip in other charges without telling you.
If there was a zero star or negative star option, I would give it to this ups location.

*UPDATE*
The level of pettiness you’ve displayed speaks volume! I was waiting to see if you would respond to this comment. It seems that anyone who leaves a negative comment about the quality of service they received at your store are by your account “in the wrong” or have some kind of character flaw. In other words, you provide only the best customer service. 🙄 I find that to be pretty unbelievable!! There’s truth to the negative experiences people have had at your store. Anybody considering going to this location, please read all of the negative comments first. You will see there’s a lot of common complaints regarding people getting overcharged.

The issue I have is not about the $2 charge (for literally two strips of tape) but the fact that you slipped in the charges without telling me and you tried to pass it off by telling me that was the total. (And this seems to be a majority of the negative reviews you’re receiving which I wished I had seen before going to your location.) I called to inquire about the extra charge that I was not made aware of. I was just curious to know what it was for but the response I got from you was so dismissive and rude so I told you I would dispute and post a negative review. You appeared not to care and even told me I could go ahead and do it.

I’ve never posted a review about anyone or any business but the way you handled it was enough for me to jump on here and warn people about you.so true to my words, after my first call with you, I posted this review. And shortly after, being the petty person you have shown yourself to be, you sent me this email:

“Hi Melody,

You called us to question the $2 packaging service fee for your 3 shipments & said something about disputing the charge with your credit card company.  You don't need to dispute it, because you'll get full refund as the shipping has been voided due to your dissatisfaction and protest.  You also said that you're not coming back to our store again, but you have to right now to pick up your shoe box and process the refund.

Several of our calls were unanswered & we couldn't leave you a message, hence this email. Your credit card is needed to process the refund.

The UPS Store”

You did a “tit-for-tat” and canceled my shipment and requested that I “have to (go back to your store) right now” to pick up my package. And when I drove all that way back to pick up my package, you refunded me the shipping payment but kept the $2. I told you if you so desperately needed the $2 you can have it because I’m not going to waste any more of my time.

And now you respond with your lies about how you attempted to call me back. Why? So you can basically tell me you're canceling my shipment after I had already paid for it? Which you then follow with an email saying you’re canceling my shipment anyway and to return back to your store “right now” to pick up my package. I responded to your email right away (I have the time stamp) and even called you back. Then drove all the way back to your store. You say I “tongue lashed” you. Exactly how did I “tongue lashed” you? Where’s the proof? I have proof of the interaction showing I spoke to you in a calm and polite manner. I was polite with you despite you standing there blatantly lying to my face about what occurred prior to my returning to pick up my package. And now you come on here and lie again. You are highly unethical and deceptive! Best believe, this is the first and last time I’m going to your store and I’ll be sure to let others know to steer clear of you.< /review>< user_id>

This is the very best UPS STORE PERIOD!
Best customer service I’ve ever had and they really go the extra mile!

My printer broke so I asked if they could print me the label and Idelfonso, what a great honest and helpful guy, said no worries! Took care of it in a flash! Got my packaged labeled and gave me tracking receipts and bam! Off I went, as a happy customer.

It’s great customer attention and service that keeps me coming back to this UPS store!

I’ve had Idelfonso also do Notary service for my family and have been extremely satisfied!

May God continue to bless and proper this store!

I highly recommend this UPS store!< /Review>

The UPS Store on Lakewood tried to charge for drop off print out.  Do not do business with crooks.  When you can go to another UPS store and they take it in without a charge.  This is a return item that suppose to be free.  Horrible services.<//Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>STAY AWAY! I don't ship often and this location was convenient for me so I figured how bad can it be? HORRIBLE! I needed an item shipped C.O.D. and thought this would be the safest way. I would be able to track the package and all would be well. I needed the driver to collect $350.00 plus the shipping, a total of $381.70. Well when the driver got to the location to deliver he asked to collect $35.20...???...luckily the receiver of the package was totally honest and called me right away! Turns out this UPS store billed the shipping $31.70 plus $3.50 (not $350.00!!!!) I went directly to the store, after about 30 minutes the assured me they would take care of their mistake and I had nothing to worry about.Ten minutes after leaving this location the owner called and said I would have to have the item shipped all the way back and start over or work it out with the receiver myself! He never once apologized or took any responsibility. I would have thought he would at least reimburse my shipping cost or at the very least the $11.15 I was charged for the box, bubble wrap and horrible service. But no, instead he hung up on me leaving me to clean up the mess. I'm not the type to expect freebies or write a bad review for no reason.  Just beware if ur going to go to this location. 10/3/17 I'm not going to argue with this guy but it's all a bunch of lies...why would I agree to charges that were so obviously incorrect. I posted a pic of my receipt...enough said Cheers! Smdh<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1506706136124, 'text': "The whole truth about this feedback of Paula Velasco is a distortion of facts, twisting of circumstances, and disowning of her share of the mistake.  When a C.O.D. shipment is done, both our store and the shipper take a thorough procedure to ensure a successful delivery of the item sent.  If there were errors and discrepancies, she should have them all corrected before leaving our store.  She only came back when the UPS driver didn't release the package due to the mismatch of the C.O.D. amounts.  I asked our staff who prepared the shipment, and she told me that Paula Velasco agreed to the figures as printed out on the receipt, which Paula VeIasco denied.  I immediately contacted UPS Customer Service, hoping to correct the issue.  However, UPS only gave these options: either to have the shipment returned and redone all over again or have the receiver pay Paula Velasco the difference of $346.50 by some other way.  I explained this to Paula Velasco and she, of course, disregarded the troublesome option #1 and would try the 2nd option.  Before we ended our phone conversation, she expressed concern on the uncertainty of option #2, i.e., what guarantee does she have if the receiver fails on the promise. We ended our conversation with her note saying that she'd call me again if there's still a problem.  Therefore, I didn't hang up on her and did apologize for all the mess that I tried to clean up with her.  Paula Velasco's thought of at least a re-imbursement of her shipping cost had to have been expressed to me, otherwise, it is left only in her thought and never gets processed for a just and fair settlement.  Although Paula Velasco's review is ONE-SIDED, IRRESPONSIBLE and UNFAIR, I'm still thankful that I read it, so I could respond to her fairly, truthfully, and objectively.

I have been using the UPS Store for many years. This was my first time at this location and the service was beyond pathetic. Very incompetent manager with an accent. She is very rude and could care less about providing service. If she is the manager I can only assume that attitude is carried on by all the employees there. Never step foot in there. There are other options right down the street such as Staples. There is even another UPS store a couple of miles away which is much better. Stay away if you believe in being treated fairly.< /Text>

TO SAY WORSE EXPERIENCE EVER IS AN UNDERSTATMENT....when I arrived I saw the manager or owner (OLDER MAN) arguing with a UPS delivery guy telling him he's going to get him fired.  The middle eastern dude had an heavy accent and was rude to another customer who was trying to ship wine. When customer asked if wine can be shipped he stated yes but then got upset with the customer because the customer was taking pics of the UPS store.  The manager (middle eastern dude) flipped out on the couple and told him he couldn't ship their wine and asked them to leave.  An argument broke out between the two...I should have known then to walk out but I had to ship my goods asap.   The dude messed up on the shipper info. so I asked him to please correct and he started yelling at me and told me that I'm not paying for shipping so not to worry about it.  I told him I was concerned about  the wrong info being on the shipping label and he flipped yelled . That's when I lost my cool and called him an A**HOLE.  He told me to get the F out of his store I then asked him for my goods back but he refused to give back to me.  He then started fighting with my male friend and began to flip him the finger and tried to fight my friend. Then he threatened to call the cops and started taking pics of my car....STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAZY MIDDLE EASTERN OR INDIAN DUDE...NOT TRYING TO BE DISRESPECTFUL BUT HE IS INSANE  I don't know how he's still in business...PLEASE STAY AWAY.< /review>

I went in there. It was not busy. A young girl by the name of Vida May assisted me. She told me that my package would be able to be sent to a P.O. Box then told me she couldnt send it after all. Like Really? The girl looked like she wasnt even old enough to work. It looked like a family owned store. I wouldnt go there even if it was the last place on the planet. after arguing with her she said ok we can send it another way. So she sent it priority mail. That was ok. She told me that i can track it. I tried for a few days and couldnt. When i called the store they told me that it was delivered already. If you can tell me i can track it and then tell me that i cant, thats false information. Btw. it got there but i would never go to this store again.</review>

Way more expensive than other ups location i have been to. I will not be back. Will mail through post office which is alot cheaper.<//Review>
<resp>{'time': 1513550671686, 'text': "Hi Maria,\n\nOur location is a 'The UPS Store' which offers shipping, among other services, through UPS, USPS or DHL.  The cost is determined mainly by taking the higher value between the actual weight or the dimensional weight (Length X Width X Ht/166) plus the distance/zoning factors.  Our location merely inputs the figures and doesn't dictate the pricing.  Thus, your big box going to the East Coast varies in cost via UPS or USPS(the post office).  If you prefer the cost of the post office over UPS's, it's entirely your decision and your erroneous and unfair review singling our store is unfortunately wrong.\n\nYou're always welcome to come back to our location; specially like the time you came when we were about to close but still took you in :-)."}<//resp></record>

< review>
Just ordered my cabinets. They look nice and the pricing is competitive but I’m concerned about the quality. The spacing between the cabinet doors are off, the drawers don’t sit completely centered, and the hinges are attached so that they can’t be easily adjusted. My contractor is having to reattach the hinges.

Some hinges are screwed in so tightly that they’ve split the wood. Looks like they were rushing through the assembly process.</review>

Very bad service. No one will help you to find what you want. Even you want to talk to someone they will tell you I am very busy. I don’t have time to talk to you. I don’t know who is the manager.very rude. Typically rude. Although I am a Chinese. They are Chinese too. I think they are too much to the customers!!  Even in some uneducated place in the world people who serve you won’t behave like that. Don’t buy anything here . They insult the customers all the time!!</Review>

big,Big,BIG where house!! They carry all kinds of flooring,counter tops and shower stall walls. They have Quartz, granite,marble and a host of other material to do your remodel.
When I walked in, I was helped right away and was given a printed quote for what I was interested in. No sales pressure just no nonsense business “my kind of place”<//Text>

We were planning to buy materials from several different sources. Instead , it was one trip to here. Great cabinets , tile and granite. Saves so much money! Don’t be offended by the warehouse staff. The money that you save is worth the lack of civilities . And YoYo is great to work with .<//Review>

Perfect place to be if you are looking for tiles and countertops. We purchased our tiles and quartz from Unimarble. They offer a wide selection of items, and the pricing is reasonable. Their shower panels are my favorite. Outside their warehouse, you can find discounted quartz and granite.

Customer service is so-so & they don’t pick up their phone. However, I must say that their people were all helpful and knowledgeable during our visit.

Parking is okay, and the lot is somehow clean. All signages related to Covid-19 required by the county to be posted were adequately posted. Social distancing marks are also visible easily. All of their employees (office and warehouse) that we saw were wearing a face mask.

If you are visiting, consider wearing gloves, especially if you intend to touch the tiles and quartz. I do notice that they clean the surface, but an extra layer of protection cannot hurt.

We enjoyed our time here.<//Review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Sorry, but this is very good quality, inexpensive tile. Period. You can save yourself THOUSANDS of dollars on your remodel if you buy tile here. You have to be willing to play by their rules and their selection is limited. However, they have lots of tile ready to pick up there and then. I just got a large amount of big white subway tiles and octagonal tiles for my bathroom niche and shower floor as well as wood-like huge floor tiles (ceramic, but look kinda like wood). I painted my walls bird's egg blue and put in a double white vanity and cool sleek white tub. My bathroom looks FANTASTIC! The is the second bathroom that I have done using Uni Tile, and I am now planning my kitchen remodel. I will go back there for sure.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Most horrible customer service - the lady who helped us purchase was very nice and helpful. We purchased counter tops, shower walls and vanities.They called us  pick up the vanities which were part of the order as they said they did not have room to keep them so we had the contractor do so even though he was not ready to install them. Today he went to pick up the remaining items and they asked for 'yellow' paper - which was given when  the contractor picked up the cabinets - during that process there was some mix-up - bottom line the contractor now did not have it but he had copies of the invoice - and there were copies in the shops files showing cabinets were picked up and balance items were not yet picked up. I went over personally to the shop to resolve this - The manager on duty has no idea how to behave with customers - she insisted on charging 10% for not having the "yellow paper" - after lot of arguments, she indicated she was doing a one time favor by charging only 5%.
What kind of business does not honor their own records?
Worst experience. Avoid at all costs.<//Text>

RUSH... RUSH... RUSH!!!!!! That is if you go on Saturday. They are so busy so there is no such thing as "customer service" at this place. Go week day if you want questions answered. BUT, they have good selection and price is reasonable.< /Text>

This is an amazing store in the Bay Area that has Building Supplies. They're great night and stone is really at a good price and there are lots of options. It's a good place for kitchen cabinets countertops vanities and bathroom Stone. It seems to be distributor of some manufacturer so the prices are really good and the service is reasonably good. They do have some basic operational shops in the back for fixing minor defects</review>

<Text>DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!! I would give no stars if possible. I bought cabinets and counter top and other items from them and first off, the display model is completely different from the product I received . Not only was it assembled poorly but the material was cheap and screws were constantly falling off. I looked into their return policy (which was not disclosed) and there were only exchanges wothin 24 hours with a minimum 10% restocking fee.
After this I was on the phone for almost am hour and constantly getting hung up on. I spoke to 4 different gentlemen that said they'd give me a call back within an hour and no calls or attempts  were made.<//Text>< Time>

Stay away from this business if you don’t want to get ripped off!! I purchased a shower door which I did not use after all, then I was still under the 30 day return policy they have and some Indian guy in the counter told me that I could not return it because they don’t take shower doors back, I was like seriously!!!?? That’s not stated on the policy terms !! he just kept on saying we can’t !! We can’t!!! And he also was rude to me and said that the store was not homedpot, some other guy was having the same issue at the moment I was there, his was worst he told me he had purchased 5000 dollars on cabinets and that he got some defective ones and wanted to get  replacements but they were not willing to do that and he was arguing with the manager some Asian lady and he said that at the end they ended up denying his request because it was not they’re fault , these people have very bad business ethics.< /review>

< Review>
I don’t want to give them not even a one star. Purchased granite for our kitchen counters. YOU MUST inspect everything before purchasing. Our kitchen counter look HORRIBLE, especially when the day-light is shining in from the windows. I HATE them. I should have read reviews beforehand. Seems like they filled in the granite damages with some kind of fillers.
Do not buy from this store!<//Review>

<text>This place has nothing to call customer service after you purchase and pay.
They did not give us all the items we bought.
They didn’t not go over every items that we bought but told us to count the number of cabinets we only. We came back for the missing toe kicks. They told us to purchase new ones and call us back after one week. They never called. We came back and asked them after 2 weeks they said they couldn’t check and it was our fault.< /text>< response>

I'm only giving one star because I can't give zero.  I spent a lot of money purchasing cabinets and quartz counter tops for three bathrooms.  They were due yesterday, we called before arriving and confirmed they were in.  Arrived at the instructed time, but two cabinets are missing -- they actually wanted us to drive to Hayward to pick up!  Um, no. Then last night, the sales person called to say the missing cabinets are in, and to pick up after 2pm. I got here at 2.30, guess what?  They're not assembled!  To add insult to injury,the guy on the loading dock is YELLING at me, because I'm unhappy.  Unacceptable.  Spend your money somewhere else.</review>

Horrible customer service
We went there to design our kitchen cabinets. They don't have appointments and so went ready to wait. Initially they said someone will help as soon as computer becomes free and then they said person is not free. We continued to wait. Around 30 minute mark, I asked for an approximate estimate on when some one can help us. Their answer was "We don't know...you have to just wait". We did for some more time and then got the same response upon prompting again near the 45th minute mark....Then we just left.

Not sure if they are interested in selling anything to new customers.

Update: We went there again for granite based on our contractor recommendations.  This time we were helped by a decent employee (Manjeet) and things went smooth.  It looks most are bad but if you can get hold of few (may be 2) good employees, you are set.<//Text>

<user>101580448158077950280</user><text>We purchased granite tops and backsplashes for our new kitchen and my contractor installed it about a month ago. Then we found many blemishes on the top (dents, cracks, scratches). We called the store but they did not accept our claim about product quality issue. So we visited the store and talked to the store manager Lotus. She came back with us in email that she will come with her GM Henry to inspect and further discuss solutions. Then she rescheduled it twice within a couple weeks in a short notice. Finally she said in email she will come with her GM this evening. But they never showed up, nor gave us a call or an email that they cannot come. Their products are poor in quality and their customer service is far below expectation. We will never recommend this place to anyone.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< gmap_id>

Good prices on tiles but limited selection. Not all service reps at the front counter are helpful. Some are downright pointing you to the wrong section due to their ignorance of their own store. But if you can find what you need, you can’t beat the price on tiles.< /review>

< Review>
If I could give a negative rating I would. I was informed AFTER it was installed that they sold me "soft quartz" counter tops and that they should not be used in kitchens. Nice, I was in several times and nothing indicated any differences in quartz counter tops or uses other than in kitchens or baths (they sell cabinets for kitchens and baths!!!!)

Anyway they said they can't do anything, if I even put a dish on the surface it leaves a scratch, a wine glass leaves a spot.

DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY! THEY SELL SUBSTANDARD MATERIALS!< /Review>

My husband talked to Manjeet for about only one minute and felt uncomfortable so he tried to find other clerk to place the order. Manjeet said my husband cannot place the order via other people. We can only order through him. I tried to speak with other clerk and Manjeet spoken very loudly to stop our conversation. No one want to help us because Manjeet is the store manager.  One clerk told me the reason is the commission.
I was trying to leave review on yelp because my anger. Manjeet threatened me for calling police because I was taking picture for online reviews.< /text>< Pictures>

I'm going to give those guys 5stars. I bought two full kitchens from them over the years and have two more coming. Yes the service may not be perfect, it's a warehouse but you get what you pay for. If you can point me to the place that has better selection and quality with at least the same pricing, i will be glad to check. I had no issues with granit and onyx slabs and at times i picked up when purchased and a few times i marked the items i liked and picked up later. I picked up kitchen cabinets assembled and boxed whenever it was convenient for me. They may be understuffed at times and you may need to wait a bit longer than some place but if you expect a boutique experience just don't go there and bash the place. It's not a botique store and it never meant to be. It may not have everything in there nut it has enough of selection to satisfy many different tastes when it comes to materials. As far as kitchen cabinets they only have like 5 choices, so it is very simple, you either like it or not. The bottom line is you get a great deal for what you get. If you are not ready to deal with some minor hassle to work through it, get a contractor and let them do the job for you. But in that case they will not pick the right color or will not get something on time, right? Life happens, things don't always go as expected or scheduled in a remodel or construction in general, just accept it ;) there are things you can't change.

I will by from those guys again. That being said, i didn't use their install it cutting services, so can't comment on that side.< /Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Nice models for bathrooms, kitchens and more, but the staff who serve are not all friendly.
There is a Chinese or Japanese who is at this moment according to attending to what is requested and does not have any kind of bad temper of that person.

(Original)
Bonitos modelos para baños cocinas y más , pero el personal que atiende no todos son amables.
Ay un chino o japonés que está en este momento según atendiendo en lo que se pide y no tiene nada de amabilidad mal genio de esa persona .</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFnq0splHIoPIiHAwYyN0vnNK8tOAPmtV0jKiz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBgn-Tcb-E7rvS7b42Idb4xfiPYdL4hjacorJR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJS-oQEXSYiUrL_elI2kMjC_uI-AxS0LdZxq-v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZc8uHuK4MCZAyeBWEV-He0E_CUyiu5F7Pq9Qy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1f53MLSxOyNJtvl-JeM2lgtaovbHS8KzF1-2M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6HUygGxfmae4NNF-60s7t9E8P9oNivfpC_zpc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTzH6yrBgsCjQOSTS0UInyNFNLzyrN0LYIIi8I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQ23ZoRf_-u8CAqrj0-xrpzjTgeTmIpiy9jDX2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1Zm04qtcCEA4bA15ne34IEvgKeq2KZDXVlwE0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPV4JhtVDSu8_SUXRwBqLjW5L6szf2YvvboTrQ3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCL1q_5Ov7tSC0E23fw7HNH4dUMUHbbE393IYC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) A bad experience today was charged 10 percent for canceling an order so if someone buys material from this place check what they sign well because if they cancel they are stealing your money !!!

Una mala experiencia el día de hoy se nos cobró el 10 por ciento por cancelar una orden así que si alguien compra material de este lugar checken bien lo que firman porque si cancelan les están robando su dinero!!!</review>

<Review>The employees are helpful but you have to be careful when you go. Just got here at 1:45 pm and they have a sign on the door saying their lunch break ends at 3:30 pm. Like what? Everyone is on a 2 hour lunch break?< /Review>< userid>

<Review>Honestly if I could rate this store a 100/10 I would, that’s because Sabrina helped me out with outstanding service from start to finish it was the best customer care I’ve ever experienced, she deserves a raise as well as Christian for making me feel at home so to speak. I feel like every Verizon store should have a Sabrina and Christian because it was AAA+++ grade service and that’s rare these days. I appreciate them helping me on valentines and having a positive uplifting vibe. So if you ever go to this store I would recommend calling before hand and setting up an appointment with Sabrina or Christian if you want the best level of care.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Text>I keep it real! Went there on a Monday. Good customer service. The facility was nice and clean. The display phones and items could be wipe down and better taken care of. Some of the pens and phones were missing or broke. It seemed like the employee was by himself. Which I don't think that's a good idea. There was a small wait time.</Text>< Pics>

The store manager was amazing and very helpful. I recommend Sammy and this Verizon store to every one! She helped me lower my bill and changed my mind about leaving to a different phone company! Thank you Sammy you are extremely professional and the company should be thankful to have a employee like you!< /text>

Highly recommend this version location!
1st. BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE!
I bought the new S9+from best buy and it came with free anti virus system that ended up being a Nasty BuG on my device!  These guys did so much to help me, that thankfully my beautiful phone is back to normal! Any questions or concerns that I have, I can always trust this place!< /text>

Michael was thorough and was able to transfer all my devices in a timely manner. He went the extra mile to find extra discounts and incentives. Thanks again!!<//Review>< userid>

I have been a loyal customer of Justin so for over 3 years when he was at the Temecula store.  He was excellent at resolving my cell phone issues and  answering my many questions.  He has a lot of patience and was at all times professional despite my many  issues with my phone.  I recently got a new phone and followed him to his new store.  I will be sending referrals for my staff to come see Justin for their phone needs .

<review>This place is GREAT!  We stopped in there for a phone upgrade.  Chet, the guy who helped us,  took the time to help us find exactly what we needed.  He even found a way to save us a bunch of money on our plan.  Je and Justin, the manager, even invited us back in a few days to help us with the iphone/android transition.  Highly recommended.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Ordered a phone cover 2 months ago, still has not arrived.  Stopped at store 7 times and called 15 times.  Supposedly their computer systems went down for 4 days so they could not receive phone calls.  Get that a phone service provider does not have a backup plan?  When I stopped in, they said the transaction was cancelled and a refund was issued, yet I have no credit on my credit card statement.  Left my # 4 times since then and no call back.</Text>

<name>Justin Lange</name><pictures>None< /pictures><Date>1520973535149< /Date><text>I never leave reviews, but I had to for these 2: Avery Sutherland & Mikiela Baltodano. Long (real dam long) story short, my phone was stolen last week, and I was having all sorts of fits about it. Assurion Insurance sucks (still don't have a new phone) but the service & helpfulness of Avery/Mikiela makes up for that. Just two, real good people. Went out of their way (on back to back days) to help me deactivate my phone, reactivate a loner (till Assurion wakes the hell up with my S8+), and Avery even sat on the phone with me for almost half an hour (after he was at the tail end of what seemed to be an all day shift) until they were able to approve my claim. Big kudos to both of them. I have had less than stellar experiences at that very same store in the past, but A&M will be the reason I go back.  -Justin<//text>< Gmap_id>

THIS PLACE IS THE G.O.A.T. Seriously I've never left this place disappointed. Jorge and Justin are like a magic dream that grants mobile device wishes idk man. If you have verizon, this is the store you need to visit. They are so kind and really try to get the best bang for your buck. 10/10 would def recommend. So much love for that place ughhhh yaaassss.< /review>

Very helpful staff. Special shout out to Karla. She helped us get a second unit when our move happened sooner than we expected.  The property is clean.  The units are also very clean.  Security is good. They deliver exactly what they advertise.  THANK YOU Superior Storage.<//review>

I called around and had trouble finding an available unit. Theresa at Superior had what i needed available now and was very helpful in getting the rental set up, answering all my questions, and even anticipating ones I hadn't thought of. So far a great experience!</review>

I have had a unit at this place for pretty close to 10 years. I'm probably one of there oldest customers (not by age). HaHa
The girls in the office are wonderful. Very customer service oriented.
Just like every storage facility, their rates are a little high (my opinion), but I'm sure they are very competitive. The one thing I like best about this facility.... It is immaculately clean and very well maintained. What ever you do, don't get stuck inside after hours!</text>

< Review>
I have stored my possessions here a few times and the experience has always been great! The units are clean and the yard is well lit. There is always a cart available for me to move things to the storage area from my vehicle. The location is centrally located and gate hours are convenient. The staff is pleasant and professional. I highly recommend  Superior self-Storage in Cameron Park.</Review>

<Name>Stan Hill</Name><Text>The women are Superior - super helpful and went “above and beyond” to help facilitate our move “home” to CA.  Very responsive to our needs - from across the country!
The facility is Superior - units new, clean and well lit  - “move in ready” -  which was critical as we showed up with a 75’ long moving van & crew to unload our household goods.  And they are expanding with new units being built.
Security is Superior - physical parameter is well maintained - and the internal camera system I saw when I walked into the office was not just for show.
Danielle - my first point of contact - and the greatest helper I have interactive with for this first month
Karla - also a key supporter in our move … agreed to open the facility early to allow the moving crew to complete the move before the heat of the day.  She has also been there to support us throughout the move.
Ashley - I’ve had limited interaction with her - but she always greets me by name and with a smile while it appears she is doing security checks of the facility.
Superior Self Storage is appropriate named - it is Superior in all aspects I have observed.< /Text><time>1563975881880< /time>< pictures>

Moving is a pain … and I’m not going to claim that Superior Self Storage did away with all the pain - but their support and facility has reduced some of the stress.  We feel our property is safe and secure - looked over by Danielle, Karla and Ashley.  And even the bathroom is always clean - a little thing but shows attention to detail …<//Text>

Every unit is alarmed. Clean as a whistle and competitively priced. Jamie answered all my questions and had me in a unit in about 10 minutes. She has to be the friendliest person I have met in a long, long, time.  Great facility. I wont hesitate to recommend them to all my friends.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<user_name>Bobby Jones</user_name><time>1398449383888</time><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>We recently moved locally and since we are downsizing, we required storage, some temporary and some long term.  Upon recommendations, we went to Superior Self Storage and secured a large unit with the contingency that we would transfer into a smaller unit as we decided what to do with or "stuff".  Meanwhile, our son and family moved here from the Bay Area, and also required storage while waiting for their house to be move-in ready.  So, we kept adding units until we had three.  Our lives were crazy for a while, but not our dealings with Superior Self Storage.  The staff was always courteous, friendly, and professional, working with us in each transaction to promptly get us just what we needed at a very reasonable price.  We were also able to use their moving truck which was free to new, local, storage renters.  This was not only convenient but it saved us that expense.  Their units were very clean and the entire facility is kepted emaculate .
We would highly recommend Superior Self Storage to anyone.

< Review>
Absolutely horrible experience. Family went my son and Husband's hair got butchered uneven cut the stylist seemed nervous when cutting hair and seemed also to be in a rush.

Our daughter wanted a layer haircut with the same length to her shoulders like she had it. The hairstylist did not listen gave her a shorter length of hair and hair seems very uneven in layers.

On the back of my son's hair you can see small marks where she got way too close to her scalp.

I would not recommend if I would have gone with my children instead of my staying home and taking care of our week old baby. I would have not paid and complain to the manager.

Instead my husband paid and left with our kids extremely upset. By the time they got home and I got to see, the location had already closed.<//Review>

I love her work and she is the nicest lady ive ever met to do my hair!! My hair was down to my butt and i told her i hadn't cut it in 21 years because my mother was so in love with my long hair and always said she'd cry if i cut so i never cut it, i came to Winnie and told her my story and she took such good care of me and my hair and my didn't cried but not as bad because it literally looked so good! And she let me keep my ponytail so i could give my mom back the long hair she oh so loved.

< review>
I went to get my haircut and eye brow wax last weekend. While my hair was being cut I set my purse and glasses on the divider between the wash stations and the chairs. As I was getting my cut down another stylist came over and picked up my purse, without asking, to admire it. When she picked it up she had also knocked my glasses to the ground and didn't even apologize. Then when I was done with the cut my stylist didn't even ask me if I liked my hair or offer a mirror so I could see the back. I had to ask for a mirror. So as I was getting up from the chair my stylist also picked up my purse to admire it. I don't know how this salon trains their employees but picking up customers personal belongings without permission is unacceptable.

The icing on top of the cake is I tried putting in a complaint on the HairWorks website but the form wouldn't submit so I tried emailing them instead and after almost a week I have no response.

UPDATE: it's been almost a week since my 2nd email to the company and ZERO response has been given.</review>

I have gotten many perms and hair cuts at this location and have used several of their stylists. Most always am very pleased with their work. These stylists know their stuff.  I'd give Nancy a try.<//text>

I cannot express how grateful my husband and I are to have booked our wedding reception at The Grand. We worked primarily with Marissa and Lauren on this event for close to 18 months due to postponements as a result of COVID. What stands out about this venue is their professionalism. We opted to go with this venue primarily for this reason and the value for what you are getting. Throughout all the changes, they were nothing but responsive and helpful in any way they could be. My emails were always answered promptly. Despite all the stress from having to change my wedding plans, I never had to worry about being taken care of at The Grand. When my husband and I finally had our event this past October, everything on our agreement was delivered as promised. Zero issues whatsoever. We had great waitstaff and a super fun bartender. The venue itself was set up beautifully. Thank you so much to everyone at The Grand for creating such a beautiful day for us.</Text>

<Text>Easy parking in the structure. Nice bathroom and classy fixtures & decor everywhere. Carpet is getting worn in traffic areas, time to replace it. Professional staff is attentive and courteous.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO6GfmrAW6m2ScQ_CMNd4iqV0gmCo3tY4oe_vG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvrCE5w6kTVJylGQN8DCLQJ3xgUWn9SubwJFy5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrmftNx3dcSX7SbtGqxm9MTdcOuL4EqWXnI_IL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJj6frEZiF2B9dHMk4MQ10zULsurmOoLqn6ZOO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVVNoLJ9V4HfdUupfZY-7IDseBF686UjJPU_3h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsnyXmamjqDjWd1XCkOirhM8Z5VdgZ2QVNAizc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrk2KwFXWTSPOJp-GuPMFbStZ2oOVhIVvSGbl4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIVDTVbFOUJ4qwEHoD9TKaPXgFzVnQMqjx_2wx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRywfx2b7AdPUwPjSqxyNjcmuP3gXf6boTsMNB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvB5G0ctEWsqoQItQbCFxZFcenLKZJ-zXc6sQi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

Excellent experience and wonderful customer service! I decided to call The Grand hoping they had availability for my Mom's Celebration of Life (repast lunch) with only a week's notice. To my surprise they had the perfect room available - exactly what I was looking for - AND it fit within our budget. Elizabeth was so kind, sympathetic, and patient throughout the whole process. She was flexible and very accommodating even with last minute changes. She made this whole process easier on us. I wanted a room well lit by natural light that could accommodate 100 people, the Monarch room was beautiful and perfect in every way, allowing us to celebrate my mother's life in a Chic and classy way - just how she was. The food was excellent and they didn't miss a detail in the experience or service. I know Mom was smiling down at her celebration and I'm so thankful and grateful to Elizabeth and her staff for making this difficult time a beautiful experience. I would definitely recommend The Grand and would definitely check here first for my next event.</review>

I feel that the ball was completely dropped when it came to the production of our wedding. This is a day that we can't do over or get back and we feel that most of our issues were directly due to the service or lack there of that we received. I expressed concern about keeping our timeline during the details meeting and was told by Kimberly that a point person would be present to keep the event on schedule and lias between the venue and us.

Carlos was present to assist us in the bridal suite and aside from not having a direct contact for him, he was great and promptly assisted with our needs. When I met the point person she did not identify her self as such. I assumed she was apart of the kitchen staff because we only discussed when the food would be set up and served. I'm not sure if she failed to do her job or if I was misinformed by Kimberly on the tasks that a point person would be responsible for. There was no one to keep us on time or to help us line up for the ceremony which led to me standing in the hallway speaking with the bartender and "point person" about the bar and dinner times as I waited to walk down the aisle in the middle of my ceremony.

When our initial $500 ran out at the bar guests were charged for drinks instead of our "point person" informing us. Less than half of our expected 96 guests were in attendance so as I was told by Elizabeth, the policy was that the money from those guests be reallocated to the bar. Unfortunately, when this issue was brought up to me I explained that to the point person and was told that I needed to wait for the manager to arrive. When he arrived an hour later our request was put into place and he did offer an additional $100 towards the bar which we appreciated but I was upset that if we had not discussed it that the Grand intended to profit from our ignorance.

Later in the evening I noticed that the food stations were empty and food was no longer being served so I assumed that we had finished everything but that seemed odd since we had less guests than we had planned for. Resulting in our mothers, the groom and probably guests as well not getting a chance to eat. At the end of the night the remaining food was wheeled out and given to us which made us wonder why we were not informed that they would be closing down so that we could announce it to guests instead of the event ending and wasting the food we had purchased. Overall we do not feel that this was worth the almost $6000 spent. I cried several times through out my wedding day and none were happy tears. We are so extremely disappointed which is a complete 180 from how we felt when we found this venue. We were promptly contacted about any and all payments due but that same urgency and concern was not taken when it came to our event. And on top of that I felt pressured to add even more guests to our final count since I was told by Kimberly that even though I purchased the tables that the Grand could not provide another table without additional guests. Which resulted in us paying even more money than we intended and not allowing us to properly account for no shows.

Overall I wish that we would have went with a different venue because here we definitely got less than what we paid for.< /review>

The Grand has several great rooms and an outdoor courtyard, it’s the perfect space to hold events. It’s located right off the 405 freeway so it’s easy to get to. I have hosted both my mother and sons (21st) Birthday parties and mother-in-law’s anniversary there. Each time we had the best of service. The staff is amazingly polite and extremely attentive. The pricing is on point! You get quality food at a great value. They work with you on your menu to maximize your budget without feeling or looking like you took any shortcuts. The bartender service was great. Parking couldn’t be more convenient. They have their own parking structure and great driveway for having valet service. I’m sure I’ll be doing another event there!</text><rating>5<//rating><Response>None< /Response>< Pics>

The Grand is one of my favorite venues in Long Beach. I have had both my daughters Quince's at the Grand and we have not been disappointed. The food is by far one of the best in Long beach. The service is outstanding. The staff is very attentive and they make sure that they are meeting your needs. Thank you again to all the staff that made my daughters special day an amazing event we will never forget! 💖 You will not be disappointed if you book your event with them.</Review>

Love the restrooms attached to the ballroom, for our parties use only! My only complaint is the staff being a little too anxious to clear our plates  & the table at the end of the evening. We ended a bit early this year, but still felt hurried out.< /Text><gmapID>0x80dd318800b4680b:0x1cb83a73bdd0f46e<//gmapID>< Pictures>

I want to thank everyone from The Grand for making our experience and my moms birthday party such a success! This event was very special to us because my dad passed away recently and we never got to throw him a birthday party. We wanted to make sure to celebrate my mom with a big party, life is short no time to waste. From the day we visited the grand, to booking it and the actual event Marissa and Lauren were so helpful and so nice. The party was beautiful, the food was delicious and all the employees from the host to the bartender were some of the most pleasant people I have ever encountered. My family and friends had so much fun and these memories I will cherish forever. This party was so important to our family and everything going so smoothly I literally didn’t have to worry about anything it almost felt surreal lol they even held our stuff overnight as a courtesy to us because they did not have to. I wish I would have known about this place sooner and would have got married here!! Lol. Thank you so much again to everyone at The Grand and I definitely look forward to having another event here someday.< /text>

<Text>Each event of the many we have held in The Grand has been exceptional, owing largely to the good & competent event managers/coordinators, Marissa & Lauren, whom we have worked with through the years; great food, great service. They have been very accommodating and always ready to assist us in all our needs. Never had a problem with parking.< /Text>< GmapID>

<review>An awesome location for any size event such as, a dinner for 300 people, with passed & stationary appetizers, soup, salad, mains and desserts. The best part is their customer service to the client and guests of the event. Set up and timing with A/V, lighting and control of course delivery is top notch. As a professional event planner, The Grand is practically the perfect blend of facilities, parking, culinary skill with service and value for me and my clients.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>This venue is one of the hidden treasures of Long Beach, located conveniently off the 405 freeway.  We held our networking events at the
Grand for several years and couldn't have been happier.  The staff is friendly, the food is great, and the back office sales desk is very accommodative.  The prices are very competitive, and just to top it off free parking. I highly
recommend it</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

The staff are always incredibly helpful and the food is amazing.  They can accommodate just about anything you need and their prices are very reasonable compared to other locations.  The Grand is our first "go to" place for any company event.  Highly reccommend.< /Text>

The Grand is an excellent venue for a wedding.  Ours was held 11/25/2017 was SPECTACULAR.  Family & friends are still chatting about it today.

My only recommendation is that the Grand inform guests ahead of time regarding changes (especially structural) made to the venue.

Well staffed, clean, and well maintaned. Beautiful view from the 2nd floor. Also got to overlook other events from the view we had. Food was delicious. Elevator was a total failure, if you have to attend an event on the 2nd floor there is only stair acces because it goes from floor 1 to floor 3. Dance floor was small but it served its purpose. There were sp many people dancing on it that the corners began to seperate.< /Review>

<Text>The Grand Event center was the perfect venue for our wedding reception. The interior was lovely, the food was incredible and the service was great. We worked with Andry to make arrangements and she was wonderfully patient and helpful as we figured everything out. I appreciated that everything they did was with great quality, and they were also upfront about the costs, which were reasonable.

I highly recommend going to one of their tasting events to figure out what you want to select for your event. Not only is it a great way to get the perfect selection, it's a fun little date night with ridiculously good food.

The Grand is a great place for a wedding reception or other formal or semi-formal parties and events.< /Text>< pictures>

google asked me to rate The Grand Long Beach Events Center.  I proudly give the Grand a 5 star rating,  The Facility is maintained to high standards, the operations/ service team makes the experience easy, the food is not banquet food,  the sales team truly cares.  Director Dan D'sa makes everything come together for all guests.  450 car parking structure is free,  I love this place,  our desire is to be a 5 star for every event..  Jim and Melanie Choura, owners.<//Review>

<Text>We held my parent’s 50th wedding anniversary in the Catalina room. It was just the right size for our event. I liked the ambiance. It has nice draperies on the ceiling, which came with the room already. The servers were friendly, professional, and helpful. They asked me to let them know when to serve the champagne and they offered to pre-refrigerate all the bottles. Cleaning up the place was done pretty fast. The servers picked up plates and glasses little by little, as guests finished eating. I am happy with my experience, and would definitely have my future celebrations here. Thank you Grand!!<//Text><Rating>5<//Rating><response>None< /response></record>

<Review>This was a terrible experience. The person with whom we booked the event was no longer there.
Nothing was explained or went over with us. In particular the burgundy chairs came with the package. Was told that we picked those chairs and we never had a choice. We ended up having to pay for the chairs  (half price)that the decorator saw in the room. The place is very expensive. Feel like we were ripped off. Not a customer oriented place. All about charging for everything.  Doesn't do any good to complain because manager will make you feel like it's your fault and they are doing you a favor.
Manager stated that they rent the chairs from a vender. We  saw stacks of chairs outside on the patio.
Would not recommend at all.< /Review>< user>

The Grand in Long Beach is so beautiful. My big cousin had her wedding here and it was the most beautiful wedding I've ever seen. The staff members were very nice and everyone came together to make sure that her day was perfect.<//Text>

I attended two events at this hotel, one for real estate investors and the other was for business networking.  Both events were well done.  The seating was plenty and the service was delivered with a smile.  If I were having an event I would surely consider The Grand Long Beach Event Center.

I attended a nice event at the Grand last night, but did not see one valet worker, front desk staff member or manager... all info needed was luckily found by a complete stranger. Very disappointed!

Who runs a Hotel with no front end staff?< /text>

I couldn't of picked a better venue to have my Quinceanera. I worked with Beto, and honestly I don't know what I would of done without him. He took off all of our stress and truely cared about making my party perfection. He helped me get every detail the way I wanted and at an economic price. The day of the party he was on top of everything and always asking if we needed anything, always aware of everything going on. I truely recommend the Grand because it's a beautiful place with great service and the food is amazing, the staff is always working and smiling. I'm so glad I got the opportunity to work with Beto, his just simply the best!<//review>

<text>My evening started with the venue starting the open bar prior to myself and my newly husband even arriving like we asked. Then when I went to go to the brides room that was supposed to be set aside for me after the long day that I had had to just get away from the chaos, the room had been given away to another event, they gave me the room that they do consultations in with all of the table clothes and chair covers. No place for me to change clothes, relax, or just have downtime with my new husband away from everyone else. I was so upset and stressed by all of the mixups by the end of the night I was throwing up.<//text>< Rate>
