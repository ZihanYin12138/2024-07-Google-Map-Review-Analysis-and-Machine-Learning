Now, lemme tell ya, this place - wowee - this place is something else.

Didn't expect much going on, place was pretty much empty. But with a name like Zaytoon, you know something must be up.

Good vibes in the store - i order the fallafel deluxe. Side of pickles because I'm feeling dangerous.

Food came out in like 5 minutes and my oh my, this has got to be the biggest wrap in SF. SIZE MATTERS.

Tasted fantastic.

We also got fries. Fries were popping.

Pickles were popping.

Service was great - we got there late without realizing and they stayed open for us.

Zaytoon was popping.

Outdoor seating was a little sketch - table was so far out into the street I thought I was gonna get hit by a car a couple times, but hey - what's dinner without a little thrill?< /review>

Their lamb platter had a variety of flavors which makes this place taste unique and authentic. It may seem pricey at first since it is $13 a plate (as of 03/2020) but it is a lot of food and it was enough to fill me up. The lamb had a lot of the lamb fat smell which does not smell very good to me but if you do like it, good for you. The seasoned onions and cucumber tomato salad are fantastic though. I just wish that the price was lower but given the location it might not be possible.<//review>

<Review>Yum. Falafel wrap was tasty, and the pita and hummus (stolen from my housemate’s plate 😈) were nummy. Next time I want to try the chicken skewer (with rice and Greek salad).</Review>< pics>

The portions are generous enough for two meals and the food is delicious: hummus, baba ganoush,  two large tasty falafels with tahini sauce on the side, cucumber tomato salad with a big scoop of feta, a dollop of tabouli, dolmas, pickled red onions, pickles, olives and two excellent, warm big pitas.

<text>Hit the spot! Might be the best falafel I’ve ever had in the US. Fresh, tasty and quick - the perfect meal when you’re craving some homemade Mediterranean. The lamb and chicken shawarma was filling and delicious, but I will always recommend the falafel platter.< /text>< user>

I absolutely love the spicy shawarma from Zaytoon. Chicken or lamb, you can’t go wrong. I definitely think Zaytoon’s food is superior to the similar (and more hyped) Souvla.</review>

<Text>Underrated casual Mediterranean spot on Divisadero. We love it for lunch or a casual weeknight dinner! My go-to is the salad add falafel (super filling). My husband loves the mezze sampler. The hot sauce on the tables is amazing! Quick service and they have a parklet outside so you can eat there if it’s nice out!</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCEdCaF-BIx5Jc92vQUvDwGROPNlbDBJ6QyZLu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRVt8oPxAc96O-yCL4RxXejjbwyxol_VhkvBHX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfIe5R25GIidvV2s_xQjmOeFCd_DwHRpfW7V-S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

The food was extremely oily and the hummus had a really strong stale taste to it. In the kabob wrap, there was enough sauce for three meals, way too much. Plus the sauce tasted as if it had gone bad. Definitely not satisfied with the service as usually all SF Medi restaurants serve good food. Would not recommend fans of Mediterranean food to try here and ruin their experience.<//Text>

This is a cute little restaurant, with counter ordering and quick service. Pricing is decent especially for San Fran, I think the falafel wrap was about $9. It was a very typical wrap, but tasty nonetheless.</text>

<review>We got a chicken shawarma sandwich, lentil soup and fries with za'atar and garlic. The lentil soup was lovely, had a strong black pepper taste. The fries were perfect (portion was much larger than anticipated) and the chicken could have used a bit more seasoning. We added some of the garlic off the fries to the sandwich and it made it fantastic. Overall a great meal for a cold rainy day.</review>< name>

<text>I order from here often. The food is delicious and a great go to for healthy mediterranean food. The falafel is not the best here, but I think falafel is not the best in most places after eating at L'as du Fallafel in Paris. I find that most falafel found in the US is overcooked, as is Zaytoon's. It's too dry. However, Zaytoon is good and worth the visit.<//text><response>None<//response>< pictures>

I had chicken shawarma, the plate is ok, but for somebody that he wants really Mediterranean food,  the lamb and chicken for me are with Mexican spices, nothing Mediterranean on the meat (for me), I m surprised they changed it to Mexican and telling people it is Shawarma !!! Or maybe I was at the special day :-(  but honestly you can’t do that to a Mediterranean persons!</Review>

<text>The food was good, but it was more expensive than I would have expected. I enjoyed the experience, but the atmosphere of the restaurant doesn't really fit somehow -- it seems sort of off. They were playing The Big Bang Theory on a huge TV, which isn't exactly what I'd expect in a Mediterranean restaurant.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

< review>
I was desperately hungry so I took the nearest place that’s open. Saw no one inside so I asked him “are you open?”  He said “yeah, we’re just not busy.”

Sat down. The guy was more interested in browsing the tv for the right channel. Then he found his channel so he decided to glue his eyes to the screen.

I stood up and said “CAN I HAVE THE MENU??????!!”

Nothing happened. Still glued to the screen. So I got up and left.

I wonder if he knows why the place is empty.<//review>

<Review>From the first time I attended the Potter's House at One Church LA . I felt like I was home. The worship service was anointed and blessed my soul. The spoken word preched by Pastor Toure and his Beautiful Wife  Sarah is so refreshing.  They are truly blessed and anointed to preach and teach Gods word. They offer prayer at the end of service. I thank God for this ministry.  It has blessed me and my two Son's in our walk with God. I would like to encourage you to attend at least one service while in Los Angels.  You can also watch them online. It will truly refresh your soul and Spirit.  And add wisdom and understanding in your relationship with the Lord. Be Blessed⚘<//Review>< Pics>

The guest preacher was Pastor Wayne Chaney who delivered a powerful and meaningful word. So awesome to see so many young people praising God and fully engaged in this ministry. Looking forward to returning.< /text>< Pics>

I've never been  very religious & church has minimally played a role in my life over the years because of many "churchgoer issues". But this church is different! It's an amazing experience every week! I walk out full & equipped to apply the teachings to everyday life! I purposely hadn't stepped foot in a church for 10 years before reluctantly visiting this church! Now this is my favorite place to go & one of the only placesI find strength & peace in my struggles! I love this place.<//text>

This is home for people who just got to LA with a dream and no friends. It’s also worthwhile streaming after you’ve left, til this day, every week the word speaks to exactly where I am in life. The worship is also amazing and Pastor Ebenezar Quaye’s Thursday services 🔥🔥🔥</Text>

Awesome! Unfortunately I live in Canoga Park and it's a bit of a drive along with the traffic to get there every Sunday and Wednesday. Are you guys still moving and if you are may I ask if you will still be located in the Hollywood area? I'm not able to come as often as I would like. My daughter drives all week long so on the weekend she doesn't like to do a whole lot of driving. Pray for us she's been offered another job. She may not have to drive as much anymore. Praise the LORD! But for the time being we are attending a church around the corner from our house. They don't worship like you guys do! I Love to worship! I can't see joining a church that doesn't worship our Creator! Everything else I like about the church but that, not so much. I like to praise God with a loud voice ! I will be praying for you all. God bless and keep you. I Love You, all!<//Review>

I had e most remarkable spiritual experience in this church. In a world where Christianity often comes with a price tag, this place keeps itself rooted in the Grace and the Goodness of God. Phenomenal pastors. Wonderful teachings. Honest and heartfelt and spirit filled. Go to a service!!! Either in person or online. It will change your life!<//review>

It was great. The energy is so lit in there. Some of the best praise and worship in LA. And people on the audience are young and actually sing along and have passion. Pastor Touré has a certain conviction and swag that is very refreshing. You can feel the energy move in this old theater.<//review>

Pastors Toure and Sarah keeps it real and brings the Word of God in a way like it's never been done before. If you're looking for a real church where you want to find real hope, real teaching and the real love of Christ, this is the church for you.<//review>

I haven’t been here yet but I’m a faithful via live stream one church LA member! If I can always feel Gods presence through their podcast or watching on YouTube I can imagine the anointing in person! I truly admire Sarah and Toure both individually blessed and anointed but a Devine force together!! I learned SOOO much from these amazing people of God and they don’t even know the impact they have made on my life from thousands of miles away! I pray I meet them and attend this church one day next time I come to LA! Glory to God!< /Review>

A word will be GIVIN and if you read the bible for yourself majority of what is spoken will be confirmation to your spirit. Never go to any church for the people focus on the word because the enemy loves to trick people and thinking on who is present a true distraction  go prayed up and you will get whatever it is your looking for. The Pastor on top of everything and his wife is by his side prayer warrior herself...so bring quarters for parking or valet either way you will be blessed</text>

<review>I was  able to visit on Easter Sunday of all days.  The service was wonderful and although they have a large congregation it was easy to get in and out.  They also broadcast or have a Youtube channel with videos of services.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Being crucified for hair color and clothing after leaving a 17 year abusive marriage was horrible for me because i didnt know how creative i was until leaving him and turning my life over to Christ! Im so happy and at peace being apart of one church of la's ministry ! Seeing all the different races and beautiful images of Gods people is amazing! Even the rebuke comes in so much love and compassion! Ive only been here a month and im growing and blossoming so awesomely!< /Text>

This is prolly one of my favorite Indian grocery store in San Jose. I had tried few other Indian stores in and around this area but new India Bazar is best one in terms of quality and variety. Very customer friendly shop. They sell quality products, You can very much find the mfg date and expiry dates mentioned. They charge nominal price. Veggies and fruits are fresh if you go on weekdays or Saturday, Sunday you might see the good ones sold already. You get all South Indian provisions here.<//Review>

I normally order groceries online. Due to the current pandemic, I found myself having to go to the store a few times to run my own errands. This store, I must say, has a good protocol in place for physical distancing procedures. They also took the temperature. Most of the  staff is friendly and helpful. There is one Sardar Ji at the cash counter. I think his name is Vir Singh. He always makes sure to ask if I found everything okay. I didn't find some vegetables yesterday. I thought they were out of stock. He asked me if I found everything. He then asked me to wait so he can check to see if they had it in the stock in the refrigerator in the back. Fortunately they  had it and it saved me a trip to another store. I like how they make sure the customers are taken care of. Will definitely go back when I need Indian groceries.<//Review>

I had a bad experience with girl working as cashier.
She has high attitude and I ask for bag , she charged for bag. When I told her no one charging for bag now . She has really bad attitude. Even she didn’t give my change and receipt. It doesn’t matter 10 cent , but she is cheating customers.
It’s my first and last experience, no more .< /Text>

I love this place. The management changed about 2 years ago. Since then I see a dramatic improvement in the quality and the inventory of vegetables, groceries. Lots of parking, isles are bigger to walk with a shopping cart without walking into anything. Their prices are also very reasonable. Their samosas are $.50+tax and they taste good.< /Review>

It’s one stop shop. We used to get all our grocery from one stop. Price is comparative to other stores. Produce and dairy is fresh. They also sell fresh somosa and few other savories. I shopped here for over an year, almost every week.

Con

The staff are friendly, but also take things for granted. They run this rewards program that gives you 20$ credit after you hit a certain threshold. But when things go Hayward , say the system crashes - they would start over from beginning. To enroll for the program - you will need to write down some personal details on a sheet of paper. There is no clarity how the data will be handled later, or who uses it for what.

I once had a credit that they failed to honor since the system was reset due to the power outage. They knew me as regular customer, yet they failed to honor the credit. For me it was not about the 20$, but more about how they take things for granted. These kind of things are unacceptable in bigger stores , but it’s ok to happen in Indian store ?? I stopped going there ever since.

I’ve given a poor rating due to my experience and disappointment.

If these kind of things are petty and does not matter, then the place is one stop grocery shop for you !<//Review>< date>

Great spices and great prices. Rhyming...snacks and candy from across the world. My mom is from South Africa and gets all the spices she is used to cooking from back home here. She taught me some good recipes which I now go shop there too.<//Text>

A bag of oranges I got had, fungus on it which I realized only when I got home. When tried to exchange it the same day with the receipt, they refused! We eventually had to argue to get the rotten fruit bag replaced!  It's not about a bag of fruits or money, it's about business not owning up to their mistake.</review>

Great neighborhood indian grocery store and default destination for my weekend grocery shopping. I used to struggle finding the exact type of staples I need under one place till I found this place. Just on the corner of Quimby and White
Now I get all South Indian and North Indian staples at reasonable prices under one roof and fresh.
Even the placement and arrangment is logical to make my shopping faster.
I every found the vegetables selection to be good while the bread selection can improve.
Recently they have started the loyalty program Big just got Bigger.</review>

It is the only decent indian grocery store in the Milpitas area where you can find most of the necessary items. Beware of their samosas because most of time they have old and spoiled potatoes filling inside. Also make sure to check expiration on items you buy. Many times the items are close to expiration or have passed the expiration. Otherwise  I find the people to be very friendly.<//text>

We had the Clements Buckaroos prime rib and shrimp dinner at the gun & bocce club on Feb. 26!  Chef Paul prepared an absolutely scrumptious meal which was served by his very well trained staff!  From set-up to clean-up it was a fun memorable evening enjoyed by many!< /text>

We just had an event this past weekend at the Waterloo Gun & Bocce club.  Food was wonderful, staff was helpful and accommodating, but most of all Paul and Tony were the best!

<review>The Owner is a sweetheart and very kind to have helped me and let me in to pick a few items when she could have turned me away that day due to covid. She gets the kindred part as her store name is. Beautiful options in this little store. Stop in whenever near oceanside!</review>< pictures>

The psychic readers or workers hang out in the middle off the store and make it so hard to concentrate. I can’t help but feel like they are reading me as I walk through the store. I definitely got bad vibes.</review>< pictures>

My safe/favorite spot on Earth!
Everyone is so loving and helpful. Just and Candy are so warm and welcoming as soon as you enter!
Cindy and Sharron are the best tarot readers/teachers. Amy is another great teacher and an amazing medium. Deb is an awesome palm reader and past life reader.
They all helped me with my spiritual and human journey in this life.
Sending love and light! <3<//Text>

<review>I love Kindred Journey's. I grew up locally and can't believe I just found the shop a few months ago. I see so many amazing reviews and those occasional negative ones. All I can say is you get what you put into it! If you go into a reading with negative closed off energy, you won't accept or understand any messages channeled to you. All of the readers are exceptional, warm and gifted beings. Debra, Katie and Cindy are amazing. They have all provided me 100% accurate readings the last 6 months, with messages I needed to know to continue on my spiritual twin flame journey. Thank you ❤<//review>< user>

<user>109604982996374933956</user><rating>5< /rating><review>Kindred Journeys is a great place to get tarot readings, psychic readings, and energy balancing. They also have all sorts of unique items, ranging from zodiac to healing crystals to yoga and meditation oriented items, as well as unique jewelry, books and other stuff you would have a hard time finding at any other store. If you are looking for anything spiritual or having to do with meditation or healing, this is the shop for you. If you need a psychic reading, tarot reading, rekki, or anything else along those lines, ask for Debbie, she does all my readings and she is great.<//review>< Pictures>

This is my go to crystal shop. The women working here can be a little standoffish and sometimes come off as arrogant when talking to customers who don't know too much about crystals or the other products in the store so I do my research beforehand so I can just purchase and go. It's one of the few shops of it's kind in san diego county so it does the job but the employees could be more kind.< /review>

<review>I find these reviews very upsetting....I have been a fan of this store before I worked and taught there and after....This is one of the highest vibrations of any spiritual stores and has been for this community for many years.  What these patrons are leaving out how many times they were helped ...Many people do not realize what a touch stone this place is for many and a lot of the people who are loyal are not just coming for fun but have real needs that are being met on a weekly basis. I spent 7 years with these people and this store and it changed my life in a way that is immeasurable.

I urge you not to take a couple of bad reviews as truth......There has been many years of love, service and growth for all who enter.....And may I remind everyone to be responsible for the energy you bring to this planet.....What does your energy say about you after you have left....If you are standing in non judgement you are standing in love....My name is Gayla and I love the people and the energy of Kindred Journeys.</review><time>1433464973902</time>< Pics>

Beyond Disappointing!  I paid for an astrology reading for "after hours special" with Kaylee.  When I called at the appointed time their phone lines were busy. When I finally got through 30 minutes later the clerk responded that she had been on the phone confirming with clients for an upcoming class. IT WAS NOT MY FAULT she said that I couldn't get through, however, they would not refund my money or give me another appointment time.  RIP OFF! SCAM ARTISTS!  Kindred Journeys cheat customers out of their money.  They do not HONOR their clients and I do believe in karma. So, Kindred Journeys...you steal from your clients....someone is sure to steal from you. And so mote it be. My recommendation to all readers is to take your business to Lady of the Lake or Soulscape to ensure you don't get cheated.  This store has pathetic business practices.  I am reporting them to Better Business Bureau, as well as, post this on the web to protect others from this theft.< /Review>

Poor customer service!  The owner is extremely rude!  I had been coming for a couple years...one of my favorites, Monique had moved on (understandably so)..I had asked for someone similar..and the receptionist referred me to 3...I picked 1 out of the 3 that was REFERRED and scheduled my appt for the next day with Burle when she was there...WORST TAROT READING OF MY LIFE...When I called to tell them about my experience, I mentioned...you cant compare these two...and you are going to have a lot of disappointed customers..  If I wanted Tarot...I would have gone to my regular, I could have done a better Tarot on myself.  Receptionist transferred me to owner...
The owner was defensive from the start..said I was lying about being referred..they dont REFER anyone...She said I ate my steak dinner..and was expecting a refund for the meal...also said I had 3 minutes to decide to cancel my reading if I didnt like it.  WELL THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO KNOW BEFORE HAND..  Maybe you should tell that to clients when they are getting a new reading..
I wasn't expecting a refund...I was sharing my experience, and was extremely disappointed...A GOOD business owner would have listened , apologized for the experience, and offered 10min free for next time...if they cared to have my business...I always get a 30min reading when I call in...whats 10min????????  Anyways...I will never go back...My friends will never go back..and I do not recommend going there.<//Text>

Amazing place. Professionalism and courtesy is a priority here. I can mainly only speak for Alicia, who gave me one of the better haircuts I have had in the greater LA in a while.
It was nice to see her put so much attention to detail and explain my options every step of the way to ensure i received the exact haircut I envisioned.
Would recommend this location and especially Alicia to anyone. She even allowed me to test out the private brand hair product, and provided insight into the pros and cons of each product depending on what my purpose was. Amazing, as it allowed me to make a more informed decision moving forward.
Thanks Alicia!</review>

<Review>Terribly uneven haircut here. Shampoo station was broken. It genuinely looks like my hair was hacked with a knife or school scissors??? I hope I can at LEAST get my money back for this. I'm upset too because the lady didn't dry my hair. I couldn't even tell it was THIS bad until it had air-dried at Target. -_-</Review><user>100381047790110401456< /user>< rating>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I haven't seen any reviews for this place yet, which is surprising since they're really busy.

I will put a caveat on my 5 stars: I have gone to get my hair cut twice and Arielle, who cut my hair the first time, was really excellent so I made sure I went to her again. The 5-stars is mostly just for her since I haven't been to anyone else.

The shop itself is really nice, bright, clean, organized and everything is new so that's all good. Everyone is really friendly, also nice. The entrance/waiting area is pretty cramped, but I have never been there long so I haven't had that bother me. You can check in through an app to avoid having to wait. And if there's a long wait there are nearby shops you can probably go look around and I'd recommend it. They have the waiting list displayed on the wall TV too so you can see where you're at in line.

Again I cannot review the other stylists, but I will say that I would personally be nervous having any of them cut my hair because both times I was there someone accidentally "checked-out" and changed my notes in the computer while I was still getting my haircut. They're supposed to check you in when you get there and check you out when they finish so they can put in the computer how you like your hair cut for next time, but since they all use the same register it seems some of the stylists get confused and check out the wrong person. I could understand it the first time when they had just opened but it's been a few months and I have reservations about having someone cut my hair if they can't use the register.

Still, for the price on the coupons they have right now (because they recently opened) it's definitely worth a try to see if you can find a stylist who cuts hair the way you like.</review>< pics>

<review>I was very impressed with the cleanliness, services, and speed of this salon. The staff was very friendly and easy to talk to. Joslyn did a great job cutting my hair and made me feel very comfortable with trying a new hairstyle. I'd recommend this the salon to any friend!< /review>< Pictures>

They do great work and stand by it.  You may wait a while when they are busy, but you are definitely treated like a valued customer.    I would not hesitate to recommend Firestone to anyone needing routine maintenance like oil changes and filters, tires, brakes, struts, air conditioning service, alignment or even a trouble light checked out.  I brought my last car here before I bought it to have it checked over from before I committed and was happy to negotiate with the seller for repairs needed and got a better price.    Maria is number one!</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMf18uMuHiL_1lnMAf4I7OLD4zQa3D_UMHT2uAf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

If you ever questioned what they were telling you or thought you may be getting scammed, it's because you were. They may make you feel warm and fuzzy but why not when they've got you bent over. They're all about taking your money and selling you tires or other service you don't need. Go elsewhere. Do get scammed here. Used to be a good place. Not sure what happened but I assure you they're not trustworthy.< /text>

I have used this place on more than a dozen occasions if your dealing with anyone other than Maria don't bother. Took my vehicle in for service to find out the service I had paid for hadn't been performed and confirmed by another shop. Glad I had checked myself was planning a trip with my family and trusted the services had been performed and to find they hadn't couldn't have been anymore displeasing. The only reason I had continue to use this place was because I have a firestone account after this experience and previous ones I'm done with this place and do not recommend any place you can't trust with your safety or your families.<//Text>

If your on a time schedule I would avoid this place at all costs. I had an appointment made for 1 PM today for my brakes, and when I got there they said that they are not able to take me in until 3:00 PM. I had been planning this for a few days now and my whole schedule was arranged around this appointment. All they could tell me was that they took people ahead of me that were walkins. This is very very frustrating. I am taking my car somewhere else then they are going to see me right away.<//review>

I have been taking my cars here since 2012, but within the last year the person up front went from someone I trusted to someone I couldn't even stand talking to. Maria is amazing and always took care of us but the new guy/girl who answers the phone is rude and needs to learn some etiquette. I won't ever be returning here with my vehicle when both times I was rudely informed I couldn't get an appointment  for  2 days, the other firestone on Stine welcomed me with open arms same day AND I only waited an hour when this firestone makes me wait 2+ hours for a schedules appointment oil change. Get your act together, and train your employees to not be so offputting on the phone and when people come into the store.</text>

Maria was very friendly and helpful. She got our car in while stranded from out of town. Thanks to this staff we got to enjoy the rest of our weekend and not loose out on hotel reservations. Experiences like this really make a difference. Thank you, Maria and the rest of the Firestone team! You guys are awesome!</review>

It would be difficult to be more disappointed following my most recent, and last, visit to this Firestone. I've had tires and brakes installed in the past with no issues, but the diagnosis of the issue with my "check engine" light was terrible. 1. I was charged $99 to my account without my permission or knowledge of the charge (since credited to my account).  2. My car was not repaired and I was told to take my vehicle to the dealer. This was after a nearly $600 charge. My dealer fixed the problem fortunately. I have filed a complaint with the Department of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Automotive Repair.<//Text>

Long wait even with an appointment. I go back because have been going there for years and they do have great service work. Last visit might have been abnormal, but 1hr45min with appointment is excessive for oil change and tire rotation.<//text>

Went in to have them look at my brakes, free brake inspection. They had my truck for 3 hours and never did inspect the brakes. By the time they got around to looking at the rear drums and realizing that they had to take the axles off to remove the drums they called me and told me it was going to be $100 charge oh, miss me with that s***.<//review>

Not bad prices but absolutely horrible customer service , my boyfriend made an app for 4pm to get new tires on his car, at 6 he asked if they were almost done and the guy has the audacity to say 'oh no, itll still be like another hr' , we couldn't believe it, my boyfriend approached the guy and he tells him  'you know I have to be home by 7 so I can connect to dialysis and I live in wasco, is there anything you can do so that this can move along a little faster , that's why I made an app' the guy shoves paper around and apologizes and that's it. We waited till 7:30. 7 freaking 30. It was ridiculous.  They really need to book their appointments accordingly to the time they actually had, they should have consideration on the people that have things to do and that take the extra step to make appointments because they have a schedule to stick to. Save your time and money and go elsewhere<//Text>

Took longer than expected, but they were very hepful and knowledgeable... They confirmed my concerns that another auto shop told me didn't exist...the other shop wouldn't even bother to look at my car, he just drove it and dismissed me saying nothing was wrong... So thank you again firestone<//Review>

I trust Maria and Craig there. Always up front and honest. Service a bit slow but always a good job done. Recommend for tires and diagnostic. Oil changes are reasonably priced also.< /text>

If I could give a worse rating I would. I have given them multiple chances. Even after they scratched 2 of the wheels on my last truck and failed to make it right. They are close to my work so out of convenience to me I made the mistake of getting a set of tires there for my wife's car. Not only did they completely lie to me about one of the 2 month old tires on my wife's car having a nail in the "side wall." They had her car for 5.5 hours and didn't even replace it. So I went to American Tire on Rosedale Hwy and the fixed it for free and told me that the nail was actually in the center of the tread, not the side wall. American was great. Just so everyone knows. Firestone tire on Chester Ave., downtown, is THE WORST PLACE EVER! The manager is rude and the staff is incompetent. I will never go there again and if your smart you will learn through my unfortunate experience.< /Review>

< Review>
Just had our oil change done on our Chrysler a week ago. My husband looked under the hood today because he heard a strange noise and the oil cap lid was gone! Whoever did the oil change on our car didn't screw the lid on tight enough! The engine is covered in oil. I'm just glad my husband checked under the hood or else we would have driven it around until all the oil would have spilled out. We had to run to Auto zone for a new lid and about 2 more quarts of oil to add. Very scary as it's our only car. Had the change done back in February and it went good. Had to issues afterwards. Most likely won't be returning. My husband will do the changes himself.</Review>

< Review>
Went in to fix a tire with a nail in it, they repaired it and checked my fluids all for nothing. I had only one tire on the car I brought from Firestone, told them the tire with the nail was not theirs but they still ran it under warranty and did not charge me.< /Review>

<review>Thanks to Instagram we discovered this gem. It was worth the drive from our house. But you only have 2 options,  beef or goat. I only tried beef items and everything was delicious. The line can get long, so if you don't want to wait go early.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTnSgBafy4DsDLYKj_BrZtBs9vNIX7Tp8d1Ceo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxP6momRoZVrjRB3_JflCXXvBYVVGi5v2QZb_N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Rating>5<//Rating>< user_id>

Jay's red tacos are the bomb. I recommend this place to everyone who likes Birria. Everything on the menu is good.< /Text>

Best birria in LA. Been to a few spots and I gotta say it was worth the wait. Try the quesatacos with an order of consome. Definitely coming back.</text>

I’ve seen Jays videos on Instagram for months now and was waiting for the perfect time to go. Well today was that day. I went with my GF and cousins. IT WAS AMAZING!! I highly recommend Jays Red Tacos. The taste, tenderness of the meat and quantity for the money was most definitely on point. I will be back !!<//review>

If they could ever get the deli department correct and you don't have to wait an hour for a sandwich that would be nice. Big huge turnover in deli department and nobody wants to make sandwiches. Sad situation. I will give this safe way one star. The pharmacy is excellent though.< /text>

<Review>Great Safeway products, courteous staff, ample parking in a safe, well-lit neighborhood. A chain store with a neighborhood market feel. Download the Safeway app, become a club member and save even more on their already reasonable shelf prices.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Feels smaller than the other Safeway in Alameda but it's convenient. But it does seem to have a more limited selection on thing</review>

<Review>Main island Safeway has way nicer staff. Last night I was talked to beyond rude by a employee, I get they were going to be closing but no right to say what she did, how she did. there is only maybe 3 women there and one guy that are nice and the manger. Before this we had to deal with a creepy guy making me and my minor sister uncomfortable everytime we would come in to shop. The last time he made a nasty comment to me and I finally reported it, i'm thankful for the manger for making that right to where I don't have to be uncomfortable to come shop for food. But staff needs a talk to about being POLITE to customers or they need different employees. I'll be talking to the manger soon about the lady last night.< /Review></record>

Safe is da way for groceries. Get the safeway app and use the manufacturer coupons and j4u to save mula. You can check out super safeway which compiles all the good deals. If you want food, go to Safeway. Something's the coupons may exceed the price and you can get extra money for shopping but that's pretty rare. Good luck shopping at Safeway!<//text>

I took my folks because I recently started going there. I get greeted at the door every time with a clean cart. The young lady even met us part way thru the parking lot to get us a cart faster. The store was clean and no lines!!<//review>

The guy who was working the deli sandwich counter gave me an attitude when I told him kindly not put mayonnaise on my sandwich and didn't hear me the first time so I raised my voice and repeated myself. Who the hell does he think he is to have the audacity to treat customers with such disrespect? If I were the manager of this establishment and had noticed him treating customers like this, I would have fired him right on the spot. Maybe it doesn't ever cross his small mind that my money I'm paying helps to support his salary. They've lost me as a customer.</Text>

<Text>They really need to pay more attention to expired goods. Having been caught several times, I now *always* make it a point to check the expiration date on any food item.

Smaller sized store, can be busy with shortish wait lines.  Staff is friendly, sometimes their fresh produce does not look as fresh as it could be..smaller store fewer customers perhaphs?  This location is within walking distance of home.</review>

< Review>
Absolutely the worst shopping experience ever in any Safeway anywhere!  They need to get some checkers that actually care about satisfying their customers, not themselves.
My advice is that they shape up or close this store immediately.  I will not shop here ever again!<//Review>

I just want to tell you what an absolutely awesome experience it was today shopping at your store at 867 Island in Alameda, Ca.  I watch as the young lady named Antoinette ran all over the store helping where they needed help!  After I gathered all my items I headed for the register, and THERE SHE WAS! ! Still smiling and holding her own😆  well done Miss Antoinette, well done!
Customer Service at it's finest 😀😀< /Review>

the people in the deli are rude and disrespectful and don't like it when you ask for help to purchase something.
The only way to get their attention is by flagging them down.

Safeway's Deli is one of the worst customer service you will ever experience.</text>< Pictures>

You're most likely rolling the dice if you go here. Usually a disappointment in selection. Even staples like bread, milk, eggs are often out of stock. They never have more than 2 cashlanes open. Butcher is nonexistent when you need them. I'll happily drive the extra 10 minutes to South Shore.</Text>

I would have given them a five star rating if it wasn't for customers causing problems and people with wic checks to make the experience tiresome.  It is a shame because they had lots of stuff 50% off.  I would have gotten more stuff  because I love chocolates, they would have melted in my truck.  Maybe next time, I love getting things for half off!<//review>

A very small market compared to the other Safeways.  Tightly spaced aisles make for precarious navigation with other shoppers.  I also notice, (and this is at most Safeways) is the odd locations for a lot of products.  Crushed tomatoes in the pasta sauce aisle instead of the aisle sighed for canned fruit and vegetables?  Odd...</review>

Not a bad selection, close to work. Like every Safeway, they have indecently long lines. Unlike the other Safeways I've been to, the cashiers here don't even pretend to hurry. They move in slow motion, almost. Spend more time in line than actually shopping.<//review>

I'd rather go to you than all the rest
True, you don't have everything under the sky
but c'mon, you're a super market, and my needs you supply
For all your grocery goods you come here
so if it's late and you need milk, have no fear

So the great thing about this place is that the lines are not super long.  The safeway on main island, though huge, at around midnight, they only have like one check stand and it's a nightmare.  I'd much rather come here.  Parking is good, they have everything you need and you're in and out with time to spare.  They don't have self-checkout, and sometimes the checker can be slightly slow, but they're OK in general.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Employees are usually having inappropriate conversations or making strange remarks to you. Nobody that works there seems to put in any effort. They all seem like they just are counting the hours until their shift ends<//text>

Comparing with south shore Safeway on main Alameda island, this one has evidently less selections. Some of the check outs aren't very courteous. They even let staff served at the check out point while he was having serious cold and running nose. I had to hold my Dutch crunch bread with my own hand to let him scan. Didn't want him to touch the bread to avoid transmitting the sickness :(
Also be sure to double check before you pay in cash. Some of the staffs weren't very honest in giving changes back or pretending people wouldn't care. But we do. I'd advise the manager keep an eye for those staffs.</review>

< Review>
Love this local treat shop! They have everything and at a good price. Homemade cookies, delicious ice cream and milkshakes, even candy!

The owners are wonderful and very nice, and they were also able to do a really quick turnaround on a birthday cake that was both beautiful and delicious!</Review>

< review>
My family and I used to come here a lot when they first opened. They were the only ones near us that had vegan options. Unfortunately, the vegan options started declining and the flavors got worse. Our favorite was the snickerdoodle which the whole family got double scoops of every time and they took that away and started adding awkward flavors like “espresso Oreo” ? Or mint chocolate chip and lately it’s just been sherbet only. I really enjoyed the good vegan options while they lasted but sadly they haven’t returned and neither have we. This place is still a 5 star for customer service and the overall atmosphere just wish they had better vegan options for our family.< /review>

OMG!!! You can not go wrong with anything in this cafe.  Ice cream and cookies are out of this world.

It has been a month since the last time I was in the shop and they remembered me and my favorites.  Now that's personal professional service!!

Must try the hot cheetos white chocolate bar 🍫. Trust me, just try it.</Review>

<Review>C & A Creamery is our favorite place to go to for ice cream and a special treat in the Santa Clarita Valley. The staff is super friendly and wants your experience to be a happy and tasteful one. All ingredients in the ice cream are of excellent quality and they have great vegan choices to accommodate customers.  I personally can’t wait to try their new sandwiches.

<Text>So happy we found this place! They have the best ice cream a million times over! We have tried the carrot cake, Nutella, apple pie, strawberry, mango, mint chocolate chip and cookie dough ice creams. All were so delicious! Their Turkish coffee & home made cookies are amazing too! Especially the peanut butter chocolate cookies and all over sprinkles cookie. The owner and his wife are super nice and you can tell they really pour their heart into their business. If you haven’t visited yet we highly recommend them! It’s our new favorite place!!</Text>< Pics>

Stater Bros has the best meats, and this location is no different. The one thing that sets this location apart from the other Stater Bros is the sushi bar. It is right by the entrance, and the sushi is sushi bar quality.</Text>

Very friendly and clean. I've shopped at all the Yucaipa and Calimesa locations and this one is my favorite. Although, I do like the bakeries on Bryant and Cherry Valley Blvd. too. Tbh, it's not the best location just the nearest to me but I do prefer it over the Yucaipa location.<//review>

This is my local Stater Bros.  I have been shopping here for two years.  Positive: The staff is polite and helpful.  The store is kept clean.  I can find what I need, things are kept stocked.
Negative: It is an older store, small, with no bakery.<//review>

< review>
Checkout is laid out poorly with the new guidelines.  Lines tend to form both down merchandise aisles and at 90 degree angles perpendicular to the checkout lanes.  In order to get into a line down a cluttered merchandise aisle, you may have to go all the way back to the meat department and then U-turn back towards the checkout.  By the time you get there, that line may be replaced by the 90 degree formation and you may need to start over back at the meat department.  The one-size-fits-all Karens who do not take into account the length of a shopping cart in social distancing and who are unable to clinically process the awkwardness of life in general tend to hide out in the merchandise aisles far from the checkout, forming the less-than-obvious lines much greater than six feet away where markings are not present.  These people start "cutting-in-line" arguments with those who process information differently, who form lines based on the markings on the floor.  I work in busy pharmacy departments where strict social distancing isn't possible and neither is it possible at Stater Bros.  I recognize that and it's OK, because it is what it is and the risk is extremely low.  Stater Bros. shouldn't pretend otherwise and contribute to the problem.  This Karen abuse from other shoppers with no clinical disease experience is out of control and I need to avoid this condition until somebody there figures this out.  The threat of arguments from these people is a high risk condition I cannot afford.  Unlike my new other sources that do not seem have these problems to a significant degree, Stater Bros. continues to be out of many supplies, so it's getting easier to consider going elsewhere.<//review>

Great prices and great selections always. Watch their ads for weekly savings. Another good deal finder at Stater Bros is their Digital Deals. Some are posted in weekly ads but the dates for digital deals dont run the same as the Wednesday through Tuesday. You can sign up online and check your phone for current specials. Employees are great about helping< /text>

<Review>Really Stater Brothers, you're allowing customers to shop without any face coverings ? I've seen at least 6 customers shopping while not wearing or having any face masks and successfully checking out? Wow Calimesa Staters you really need to look into your management. Don't believe me? Just review your tapes @ around 3 pm 5-1-20....and when I spoke with 2 of your employees they shrugged it off? It's people like this and your management team that will have us locked down for longer than needed.</Review>< pics>

<Response>{'time': 1588703002550, 'text': 'Hi Brett,\n\nWe strongly encourage our customers to wear face coverings per CDC guidelines, but we will not be stopping customers from entering the store if they are not wearing one. Being able to purchase food is essential and we are obligated to sell product to all those in need. However, we are offering masks to customers if they don’t have one. Police and Sheriff have been identified as the enforcing agencies and we will not ask our employees to enforce the mandate as that could potentially escalate (to an altercation) and jeopardize their safety and the safety of shoppers around. We appreciate your patience during this unprecedented time and we look forward to your future visits.'}<//Response><gmap_id>0x80db50a2b767bf25:0xbccbce62e6962010<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

( Like sushi nori or killer chili oil )
The staff is always super kind and helpful...shout out to miss Nancy and miss Gena at calimesa for being extra cool!
The lines do get a bit long on the weekends, so I prefer to do my shopping in the late evening ( open til 11pm ) or early in the morning..( open at 6am )
I do have to chuckle to myself about the new uniforms, as they are the same as the car wash on Yucaipa Blvd.
Bring extra money for the homeless girl scouts pushing their highly addictive girl scout cookies out front if you want to avoid cookie-less guilt later.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I'm finding it hard to figure the layout of this store. Deli stuff lacks organization. Brands of items, grocery or household, are limited. If you see crackers on an end cap, wouldn't you expect one side or the other to be the cracker aisle? Not here. Crackers are sever aisles away, like the while other side of the store. Makes it hard to shop, easy to forget other stuff you intended to purchase.<//Review>

One of my favorite stores to come to, they always have friendly staff and awesome customer service, but this time was different, who appears to be the floor manager/supervisor was super rude to the cashier who was having issues with the credit/debit card pin pad while helping a customer, the cashier asked the manager for help and She replayed back by giving her a rude and disrespectful attitude, raising her voice at the cashier and making "faces". Lack of professionalism from this person, if thats the way she treats her employees, I dont know how she will treat a customer having an issue or even a question in the store.<//text>

When I walked in, I asked where the recycle receptacle is for the recyclable bags which we purchase for 10¢ which we are supposed to recycle.The manager informed me that he removed it because it was never being used. Not true because I had always seen bags in the recycle box, yet he doubled-down on his refusal to provide access to a recycle box.<//Text>

Unfortunately here in calimesa we don't have options for grocery stores. This is pretty much the only option unless we drive over to yucaipa or other cities. The milk fridge is constantly moldy with black mold covering the shelves that the milk sits on and under.  I would think this would be a health concern to customers. Typically I will make the drive to a nearby city for my shopping needs especially dairy<//Review>

< Review>
Staters is way to expensive, they keep jacking up the prices all the time,and they seem to  think know one notice's! Also they waste a lot of produce!!! INSTEAD OF  HAVING A GOOD  FARE PRICE,  FOR AVOCADOS, SO EVERYONE COULD  BUY THEM , THEY  JACK UP THE PRICE AND THROW THEM  OUT INSTEAD,  THAT IS RIDICULOUS AND VERY WASTEFUL!!!  INSTEAD OF  BEING Thankful  to be in business, and being  a market for the people,  they just rip everyone off! And baggers are NEVER TRAINED, THEY PUT HEAVY STUFF ON  THE BREAD AND SMASH IT ! CLEANING  SUPPLIES,  IN WITH FRUIT, AND THEY NEVER HAVE CHECK STANDS OPEN!!</Review>

Great market for all your groceries. I love there meat counter. There meat is 1st class. Prices are reasonable. A lot less then Vons or Albertson.  Staters Brothers is family owned. My only complaint is that they need a few more cashiers. Sometimes the time in line is long, but over all great plave.</Review>

<Text>Racist, the butcher is not allowed to speak Spanish because management gets upset. I'm forced to come here because I dont have another option. We do limit our visits to only picking up what is needed and not the weekly groceries. The news should come here to report.</Text>< UserId.>

I have shopped at the Stater Bros. Market's ever since I can remember; having been born  in the I.E., Stater's was the place to go for quality service goods, produce, meat and a friendly staff ready to help with whatever needs were. A number one in my book.<//Text>

This store is close to me.  However, I prefer the one in Yucaipa (Bryant/Oak Glen), It's bigger, better and they are really friendly.  I don't ever feel looked down upon when I go there, like I do at the one in Calimesa.  Just plain rude.</text>

<review>For the most part, a nice place to shop...however, the produce section is mediocre/poor, the aisles are to narrow, and too many displays constitute the down side.  Checkers and baggers are efficient and pleasant...good front end mngmt, quick to open new lanes when busy.< /review><user_id>112877485689623002317<//user_id>< gmapID>

It was bad. The cashiers were rude and didn't talk much unless they were asking for your money. Also one of the cashiers gave me a dirty look when I was checking out.</Text>
