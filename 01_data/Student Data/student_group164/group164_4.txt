Friendly staff and conveniently located in the middle of Castro district. An excellent spot for locals and visitors if you need a good haircut. Reasonably priced and skilled barbers. I'm sure all off them are great, but I always ask for Betty. She's great. As of March 2021, they are accepting cash only. Let's hope that they will bring back credit card transactions back soon. 👍🏼🌞🥳🥂</review>

<text>I’ve been coming here for years for one main reason: no social pressure. After I tell them what I want done I stop talking. I have never had anyone from this business try to start a “friendly” conversation. It took me decades to find this situation! I always arrive as a walk-in and take whoever is available, they all so far behave this way and I am must be at dozens of haircuts by now. They provide excellent service for low prices. They could half their quality and quadruple their prices and I would not complain!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>On the price list normal cut is 22 and at the end I had to pay more, because my hair is longer. At least mention that in the beginning. Finished within 10 minutes... Sides are not even. In that saloon is all about quantity and no quality.  👎🏻</Review>< pictures>

I couldn't believe I found a place in the city that only charged $20 for a woman's haircut! They actually did a really good job! I only needed a trim but the woman that cut it was very polite and the place is clean and only a ten minute wait.< /Review>

Lady cutting my hair was in a rush and accidentally cut a huge chunk of hair off the top of my head, leaving me no choice but to get very short buzz cut which is not what I wanted at all. Still made me pay for it, too (granted, half price, but still, what a bargain...)

Pretty disappointing since I had five solid haircuts before this with no complaints.</text>

Prices keep going up and a men’s haircut will run you $20 at the time of this review. Add $2 if you want a wash afterwards.

Call ahead and make an appointment if you don’t want to wait. Walking are welcome but might have to wait 5-15 mins.</text>< pics>

Not good for women's haircuts, especially if you don't have pin straight hair. Lady was friendly, but very bad haircut.</review>

HORRIBLE! Don't spend your money here. They cut too fast for it to be a "nice cut". I told the stylist to cut some stray hair from the back of my bf's head, however, she rationalized every request with a reason on why she was leaving uneven hair on him. It was pure laziness. We made an appointment but she only spent 10 minutes on him and was in a hurry to get to the next walk-in. I had to trim the long hairs after we got home. We will not be coming back.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I get my hair cut here every 3-5 weeks. All the women are friendly but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU ASK FOR BETTY!!

Betty is an absolute gem. She's been cutting hair for more than 20 years and specializes in whatever the trending hair cut is.. Currently the "low fade" or as some people call it, the macklemore.

The cherry on top is the (usually) free shampooing and shave which the other stylists tend to charge for. The whole thing should only cost you $20 so make sure you tip well.< /Text>< gmapID>

The BEST service! I always get great service when I visit this cricket store, no matter what my needs are, but yesterday when I went in, and with every store being so busy right now with everyone getting their Christmas shopping done, the guys working were SO helpful! I couldn't figure out what phone to get my boyfriend and I couldn't spend a whole lot of money, but they were totally honest about quality of phone for my budget, and really took the time with me to make sure I didn't spend money I didn't have, or leave with a poor quality phone. I wish I would have gotten their names to include in this review! Seriously the best Cricket store I've been to!< /text>

Dishonest salespeople. Lied about product in stock. First salesperson said affordable phone was in stock. Second salesperson said it wasn't in stock. Lied about price and about taxes. Said total would be $100. Terrible people. Picture shows phone is in stock and the price and the fees.<//Text>

< Review>
This store was aaaaaamazing and will surely recommend others to come here. The process to transfer over was easily executed. My Facebook, what's app and all my contacts were passed over with ease. Thank you to Brian and the rest of the team that assisted me to get everything done. And they were able to get me a 25 dollar credit to my account as well</Review>

<text>I went in yesterday and the costumer service excelled all expectations. I came in inquiring about changing carriers and Alex helped me and really walked me through the process. He was very patient and very helpful! I would definitely recommend, Alex recommend some very affordable accessories and I really got a steal on my new phone and all my cool accessories! I will definitely be coming back and asking for him !< /text><Time>1601057088259</Time><userid>100011288363841448619< /userid><Resp>{'time': 1601084411777, 'text': "We're so happy to hear about the highlight of your visit!

I was just there today looking to change from T mobile and was helped by Eric and Alex. Eric explained and helped me get my account number and Alex helped me choose an affordable phone. I am extremely happy with the service. I will definitely be telling my family and friends to come here. These people are GREAT !!!!< /Review>

<Review>I couldn’t have asked for a better customer service! Jose was on top of his things very friendly and helpful. I came in to open a new line for me and didn’t try to up sell me with nothing I didn’t need. Asked him what I needed and he knew exactly what to offer. Definitely going back to add my family!!<//Review>< Rating>

Shot out to cricket again I wanted to take the time to show that when you take care and treat people with respect and compassion you build a caring circle I drove all the way from chino hills ca just to give business,I’m used to being treated rushed talked to like I’m restarted or should be grateful for a service that I pay for well..;not cricket they have treated me like a customer and friend I went in naught iPhone 11 with insurance two lines whole yards not only were the savings big enough to buy it outright and surprise my fiancé,needless to say I was hooked up with extras like speaker that bumps better then my Bose lol and half off second lone etc thanks you guys so much during Covid this service is beyond essential and thank you for keeping family’s connected and putting smiles that’s priceless!!😎✌️👀😁< /Text>

I was visiting my father in Huntington Beach and my phone was out. It happened right before leaving Oregon and the Cricket store up here was absolutely horrible. Went to this Cricket and they were great, the girl that helped me was so helpful and got me sorted out. Great staff, helpful and hard working, very nice too.< /Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I Had a horrible customer service experience today by Eric Carlos, Edger Angel & Jose Oriantin. I’m a long time customer of Tamara’s with 5 family phones from this store. Today, I needed to get my son’s insured cracked phone fixed if possible or a new one. Four employees were in the store, no clients. I asked them to help me & my 11 year old. They looked up my account, said I needed to go to a phone fixing store across town to see if they could fix it and my ins. $8 a month would cover it for $29. I asked how much if I bought him another. They didn’t try to sell me another. They mentioned if the place couldn’t fix it I had ins. I drove across town. The place they sent me said they don’t work with cricket. They said I had to file a claim. I called the cricket store to let them know they could have just had me fill out a claim there. They didn’t need to send me across town. I’m planning on switching my 5 phones to anther carrier today. Tamera was so much more helpful. You lost a great manager. These guys need training on customer service.</text>< pics>

I really appreciated this store’s customer service, particular the young manager Tamara Mesa. My dada was running low and she quickly came out options and helped me to upgrade my plan during my travel period, and advice me how to reset back to normal when I am done travel. She is such a smart, friendly and efficient manager that it took her only a few minutes to solve my problem. She also explained to me how my bill will be charged for the change to make sure I won’t have any concerns.  She is the best of the best! I will stay with cricket because their employees like Tamara are so nice and helpful!<//text>

AVOID THIS STORE FOR CRICKET. The people in this store will LIE to your face and reply "It's policy" instead of standing up and being a man and take responsibility for what comes out of your mouth.</Text>

The sales rep at the store was phenomenal. Not only was he knowledgeable about the product he was very friendly and positive. He was the only person working and he still set up my two lines and another customers phone. He always greeted other people as they came in and checked in with the others as they waited for their turn.</Review>

Hanna Rose compromised all my information by actually allowing herself to be also on my account when she set up my phone. I walked into another cricket store to have a problem fixed with my phone just to find out that she had access to my account and that she was also on it. This is absolutely disguisting and makes me sick knowing you cant even trust employees at a store that sets up your phone. I have been tracked and monitored the whole time. She is part of the Scientology church which is a cult. They have evil practicea where they follow people. They stalk them. I will be suing cricket and all their employees individually for what they are doing to people. This is demonic what they do to people.<//review>

Wonderful Service. I truly enjoy walking into Express with no intention to buy items, then walk out with 3 bags. Veronica C. ( Store Employee/Manager) is EXTREMELY helpful. She is they're almost daily, and she keeps the store clean and organized. I LOVE IT @ EXPRESS / Del Amo Mall - 5 out of 5 stars!<//text>

<review>Good selection but one of the woman workers was very rude. Instead of explaining why I couldn’t use a free scarf with the a $100+ purchase offer she asked another employee to “explain” and the guy just shrugged it off. Blonde lady so damn rude.< /review><Response>{'time': 1602521001387, 'text': 'We appreciate you sharing your feedback with us. Your comments have been shared with the District Manager.

I love their clearance rack. 50% off of already reduced prices. I'd definitely try on the clearance items and be sure there's no damage. Once the cleara3item us sold, there's no returns.<//Review>

<text>Disappointing customer service.

Was in there today on 9-23-18 and bought  two items. Got back to my car, and realized that the  salesperson forgot to take off the sensortag on one of my items. Had to walk back from the parking garage and waste over 30 minutes of my day to get it removed. Spoke to whoever was in charge, and asked that I be compensated for the inconvenience, and was told that they cannot compensate me at all, and all they could do was remove the sensor.

Time is money.  Many stores offer the item for free if given no receipt.  Why doesn’t this store do the same?  Maybe start docking pay on the customer service reps for every item they forget to remove the sensor on and see how fast the problem corrects itself.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>First of all I like their clothes a lot. It's right at the semi formal. It's a little pricey than Zara but certainly has better quality than Zara.

So I want to tell you that my review is about this specific location. The employees at the cashiers desk don't know their company policies!!
I visited this store on 3rd of July. The employees at the fitting room were nice and friendly so I had great experience with them. I tried some clothes and figured that some of items weren't my size. So  I ordered some online at the cashiers desk as one of the fitting room staff advised me. While I was placing the order, I saw this advertisement from the small screen on the top of their pin pad, saying that students can get 20% discount. So I asked them about it. At first, they answered me that there is no student discount. So I show them the advertisements. After she read it with me, she tried to give me discount but it wasn't working because of some systemic error. Her supervisor couldn't figure it out either so they told me to come back to the store with the receipt on July 5th or to call the customer service to get the difference back later.
So I went back to the store on 5th I saw another lady at the cashiers. I asked her and she told me that she can only give the difference back if I bring the delivered clothes with the receipt back to the store. I was annoyed but came back home and waited till the clothes arrive. When it arrived I called the customer service and ask them how can I get the difference back. The worker at the CS told me that it's impossible to get a discount on my past order unless I sent the clothes back and reorder them with the student discount code. I already wore them and I don't want to wait that long to get my item. The CS person was saying that it's the store's fault that they informed me with wrong information!! It's really disappointing that I lost so much of my time because of the employees who don't even know how their own policies.< /Review>< pics>

<review>This bakery makes you realize that “this is the way that bread should be made!” I was blown away by the texture and flavors of the bread. They take such pride in the quality of their product. Taking time to explain the different breads and how they are made is a benefit of visiting this bakery.

The line to get some bread shows that they have a huge following and people love their product. I would highly recommend coming here. It is a must visit!</review>< user_name>

Love their sage garlic bread and their cilantro spread. It is made with organic ingredients too. Although it is two weekends in a row now that they don't have the gluten free sage garlic bread. Oat Bakery, if you are reading this, please make more gluten free sage garlic bread, at least one more :)</review>

We were strolling through the Santa Barbara downtown and literally the amazing fresh baked bread smell made us take a detour into the bakery. Not surprised, there were all kinds of freshly baked breads on the display. For my love for bread combined with irresistible options, I got carried away and bought bunch of loafs which I couldn't wait to get back home to bay area to try them all. Definitely all star. If you are into breads then must try if you are around the area. Great taste!</review>

Well, here I am again in the heart of the Midwest visiting family and wanting to have some great sashimi!  It is in COVID times and there is no in-house dinning in Illinois right now so we made a large to go order for 4 adults and 1 youth.  1st the freshness and quality has not been hampered by COVID or take-out orders!  Blufish is still my number one place to go in the Midwest!  We started with their wonderful Maguro tartare with its outstanding flavors based on pico de gallo, tobiko, avocado, ponzu, on a shiso leaf, and served with crispy wonton chips.</review>

<Text>Focaccia (esp. sourdough wheat, salt & pepper) is outstanding. Their sourdough bread loaf with sesame is equally good, but only because the charcoal they add is chemically inert (so tasteless). What's with all the dietary charcoal, California? It's weird. They make small loaves of while grain bread with neat inclusions, like shallots and mushrooms, olives and pecorino cheese, brie and sour cherry, sage and garlic, etc. It's pricey though; expect to spend about $10 a loaf. They sell by portions.</Text>< rate>

< Review>
Run down early in your pyjamas worthy!
I am not a 'bread person' because too often bread is waste of space for more delicious treats in life, but only because cheap bread is not real bread! No carb or calorie is wasted here! Every fresh healthy bite should be savoured and enjoyed! Oat Bakery is what I wish all bread could at least aspire to. That soul cuddling, crisped pocket of fluffy flavour! I got the Danish Rye and it was simply superb! If you are not a 'bread person' please rediscover this divine food here!! I also grabbed the sage and garlic bun and in my excitement, gobbled it with my neighbour while it was hot, before I got home. Thanks!!!<//Review>

<review>First time here, but long time visitor to SB as we have family in area. We ordered the Gluten Free vegan Date and walnut cookies ( fresh from oven and melt-in-your- mouth devine), the GF Seeded Sourdough  ( we ripped into in the car and kept eating it even though we were on the way to brunch!),  and the brioche bun with feta and sage ( I will be ordering these for our family Thanksgiving). Staff was very friendly and helpful, but the quality of the breads was just superb!</review><UserId.>104595514162191834858</UserId.><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Their Danish rye is fabulous. However it is only sold on Saturday and Tuesday. They have samples on Saturdays. The bread I sampled have all been great.   Get there early because they do sell out.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Visit this bakery for unique and tantalizing loaves. I loved all three loaves that I tried - the seeded sour rye which made THE best cream cheese and cucumber sandwiches, the sage garlic which I used in a strata, and the brie cranberry which I toasted and ate with a little butter. I live very far away and regret that I can’t visit this bakery often!< /review>< pics>

My daughter and I have Celiac's and do very well with Oat bread.  It's the best tasting/texture/healthy bread we've ever had.  (Don't usually eat oats.)<//review>

Happened by here on a walk. This bread is so delicious and filling. , a meal in itself. It was a hard decision , but went with the cherry almond Brie. They were happy to give us samples of the bread and different vegan spreads. I’m going back before I leave for home in Eugene.<//review>

<text>Where do I begin?! This place has the BEST bread and spread I’ve ever had. No joke. I even bring my family and friends here, when they visit from out of town. Their Garlic and Sage bread is my favorite. And you HAVE to try their cranberry, walnut, jalapeño spread. Good lord it’s good. I’ve tried almost all of their breads and there hasn’t been one I didn’t like. Ooh and their pesto and cream cheeses are delish as well :) I HIGHLY recommend coming and getting some bread and spread :)</text>< Pics>

Best bread ever - That was the first loaf I bought. The next 2 garlic sage were tastless....no garlic and maybe 1 piece of sage in entire loaf. Did you get a new baker?</text>

If you want to treat yourself to a relaxing and WELL DONE manicure service - DO NOT CHOOSE THIS PLACE! Zero care about attention to detail. He was rude and did a terrible job with my cuticle and nail beds. I do better manicures for myself which made me feel like my money was wasted. The energy is rushed which eliminates any idea for pampering, and some elements of the manicure service were left out, and the polish was sloppily applied. My advise to anyone when it comes to getting natural nail care services like manicures is to go somewhere else. I won’t return. The reason I gave one star was because of the woman who did my pedicure, otherwise it would have been none.<//text>

< Review>
I had a acrylic nail gel set along with a pedicure gel and in total it was $77 when they told me it would be $36 in total. They OVERPRICED me. I loved coming here until this occurred I will not be coming back. I got my pedicure done on Friday 4 days ago. And they look like I need a refill it’s ridiculous. My pedicure nail polish came off I’m not sure what nail polish they are using. My acrylic nails need a refill and want to come off. I don’t recommend this place.</Review>

I only come here to pass time while waiting for my car to get serviced. This place is way too expensive, prices increase every time I come here, even before the pandemic. Technicians ask if you want something done, without informing you it’s an extra charge. That’s not good customer service at all. Very good pedicure, but I’ll find something else to pass the time.</Text>

Worse gel manicure. It looks like a kid did it. And when I said something the lady fixed one of them and said the rest were fine. But they all had dents in them. Also they double charge me $20 tip. And when I went to talk to the manager she said my bank was probably wrong. She did return my money took 4 business days.<//text>

This was my 2nd time here. My first experience was excellent, this last experience was awful when I decided to get a manicure with gel nail polish. The lady doing them was awful & she kept filing my nails even after the final polish was applied.. I told her you’re filing away the nail polish & to do them over.. that too was horrible. It looks as though I need a do over badly!! I can’t stand when I can’t communicate when I’m paying for a service. No complaints for the lady that did my pedicure. I left a small tip & it should have all went to the pedicure lady. $68.00 for what?< /Text>

1. 1st place where my gel manicure actually lasts longer then a week.
2nd. Has a dedicated receptionist! I often struggle with accents so this is a big plus for me.
3rd. They offer their clients a glass of  wine or champagne which helps make the experience a relaxing one.
4th. Techs all appear to be nice and they do good quality work.
Highly reccomend< /Text>

Came for the first time and loved it. Got a lovely gel polish pedicure with a parafin wax treatment. A whole hour in the massage chair whilst being pampered with a pedicure & a glass of wine? Freakin' priceless.<//Review>

Not the best customer service for new clients. The person that greeted me at the door pointed towards the rear of the building told me to go and pick a nail polish. Then I was never escorted to the salon chair so I just stood around and final a woman that didn't speak English to well waved me down to come to her...  😨😨😨</review>

I went to serenity nails for the first time about a week and a half ago, and within 2 days I had to go
back twice for broken nails . They fixed it I left 2 days later another nail broke. And the chrome was so cheap I was at work washing dishes and the chrome just peels off.</text>

I reviewed this place before with bad experience and tried them out again to give them a chance. I got my gel Friday, the next day 2 of my gel came off. Came back for them to fixed it Sunday and again it came off Tuesday. I should just get regular manicure instead of getting gel that supposed to last atleast 2 weeks.</review>

Been coming here since about two years and promised myself I’d stop coming two months ago but my friend forced me to come back with her a few days ago.. really terrible service with rude workers. Just because you have a few chandeliers and nice decorations doesn’t mean you don’t have to put effort into your customers. The time prior before I came back recently all of my nails popped off after 5 days. This time the lady used the wrong size acrylic nails for me and everything looks so sloppy especially the polish and each nail has a different shape.. not to mention my 8 minute $25 pedicure. definitely not coming back from now on<//Text>

She was very detailed with the nail acrylic shape and polish, I believe once you become a regular they don't pay as much attention to quality. The husband is like he is racing to get done with you, not gentle at all with your hands. I always try to think that maybe they are having a bad day or they are tired, but it never changes. Sloppy job, nail polish quality is disgusting (watered down) or better said so reduced with chemicals. Not worth the $35 I pay for refill. What ever happened to the spa relaxing music? Katie Perry and Drake now on full blast ...and let's not talk about the pedicures, the girls don't know much. Sorry to be a troll, but I am very disappointed at this place, being that it has a lot of potential.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>I came here once a few months ago on a whim, but I was SO pleased with the service and results! I continued going to my regular nail salon which is closer to my job, but today I had a "mommy's ME day" and wanted to come back. I rode around for 30 mins looking for this place (which should tell you how awesome they are for me to waste gas) but couldn't for the life of me remember the name or exact location. Long story short, I FOUND IT! Now this is my second time coming and I'm ready to break up with my other nail lady officially now! I had extremely bad calluses on both feet, but when I tell you after that paraffin treatment, OMG! Those callus are gone and my feet are as smooth as my baby's. I HIGHLY recommend Serenity Nail Salon, namely Kimberly!</text><time>1505606372192</time>< rate>

I just tried this place.  It's closer to home and the price is about the same as the place I usually go.  I was disappointed.  I got the pedicure that has the foot and leg massage.  I guess the massage was the few seconds she rubbed lotion on my feet.  Guess I'll be going back to my usual place.< /review>

I've been here twice and both times the people who did my nails were so rough with my nails. The first time my nails weren't even shaped right and they were so thick. Second time the lady was so rough that she was using the drill thing on my skin and she didn't even paint my nails all the way. This is the worst salon. Very unpleasant.< /Text>

<text>I love this sweet little bakery! Banana tarts so delish. My favorite are the empanadas. The crust is soooooo flaky and lite. Everything I've ever had is very good. Staff is super friendly.

<time>1552709907917</time><Rate>4</Rate><text>TLDR: A small, local bakery with quite a bit of variety. They have some exceptional baked goods that left me wanting more. I would recommend going if you're in the area.

This place was not on my radar at all, it being so far away from the commercial area. I was introduced to this place by my brother, who goes around San Francisco and tries out many of the bakeries in the city. The bakery is not the easiest to see when passing by, it being fairly small. Upon entering, the first thing you see is the pastry case housing all of the baked goods that they have produced for the day. Directly behind the counter, there are people in the back working, making the baked goods, so there is a continuous stream of bread and pastries to be sold. As you focus your attention to the left, there is the register where you make your order, pay, and receive your order. I got a chicken empanada, warmed, and a hot cross.

When the lady on register asked if I wanted my empanada warmed, she asked if I wanted to warm it by oven for one minute or oven for seven minutes. I wasn't listening that attentively so I asked her to repeat it, which she did and I didn't understand the difference. After a small back and forth and her becoming slightly frustrated, I realized she misspoke and meant to say microwave. All this to say, you can either microwave or bake the empanada. She gave me my hot cross and I sat down on one of the tables to wait for my empanada to be heated.

The hot cross was amazing and nothing like what I was expecting. The pastry looks like a scone, but it is nothing like a scone at all. It is unexpectedly soft, much like bread. The bun (I would say it resembles a bun) has dried fruits in it, raisins and dried orange peels. The two dried fruit created a combination of both sweet and tangy that worked well together. The cross on the top was some kind of icing, that overall added to the sweetness of the bun. It was very good, to the point that I bought a second one when I was leaving.

After waiting the six minutes, the empanada was finished and it was good. The crust of the empanada was very flaky and it broke apart easily in my mouth. The stuffing inside was well seasoned, the chicken was flavorful and the corn was a plus. Overall though, it was nothing special about it. As for the bakery as a whole, they're pretty good. I felt the lady on the counter was a bit rude, but she was most likely working since the morning and was flustered. The empanada was alright, but, as stated before, nothing special. The hot cross, however, was absolutely delightful and were pretty must sold out by the time I was leaving, yearning for a second one. If I am every in the area, I would go back to try some more things there.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtz99wu3H_Zo0r4oQdF_8kO8UPOfcRTd3FLjKM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFLzRWrERO63nvAaWs386kLkC9Iwlb-BT8s5W3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP670o3x_tb5psgCW6RfVJAeB8ZvJjyjUzfKcDN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>The only baker in town unfortunately. They’re understaffed it seems as on a Saturday morning their case is about 1/3 full of the basic breakfast pastries. Their croissant was disappointing as was the apricot scone we had. They both seemed to have been baked the night before as they were pretty dry considering we were there only an 2 hours after they opened.< /Review></record>

Croissants made of genuine puff pastry dough instead of that mysterious American bread material most are made of these days. Great bread. Small desserts. Custom cakes. All made of simple, fresh, local (as possible I imagine) ingredients with Incredible results.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Joe, the head baker at Destination Bakery, is an important person in my life because Joe saves me a challah bread every Friday. My daughter loves the Destination Bakery oatmeal raisin cookies, and will eat as many as I bring home. Joe makes fancy pies and simple danishes, and the fruit tarts are really great- not too sweet. Joe does special orders, he does baking for the traditions of every holiday, check him out.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808f7e6381aed5a1:0x1d22dea2bb8dcce5<//gmapID></record>

Love this place. Everything is delicious but my favorites are the cherry danish, the oatmeal raisin cookies, and the cinnamon rolls. The staff is friendly. Never had any complaints except when they run out of cookies.< /text>

They liked busy which is usually a good sign.   I got a chicken epanada w which they asked if I wanted it warmed in the oven or microwave. I went with oven.   It was still cold on the inside.   Not very tasty...something was missing.  Service is friendly here and there's only a few tables to sit at.</review>< Pictures>

Open only for about the first half of the day, arguably have the best empanadas in San Francisco, and fresh baked cheese sticks.  A few tables and a couple of benches.  Prices are good.</text>

Patty did a great job with our rescue puppy. He's wonderful but a challenge and she did a 5-Star job. Never thought it could happen!  Then owner was very responsive and informative about possible training and a trainer called the same day. Very responsive and responsible.<//Review>

<review>Left my 1 year old dog here for two nights. Everything went well, they fed him according to his schedule, and gave him treats. It was a big plus to be able to watch him on the Webcam during the day! I enjoyed the report cards they send everyday with behavior notes and pictures! Great place with nice people working here. Would definitely use them again for future day care or overnight needs< /review>< pics>

<Review>Dog E Den is the very best place for your dog!
My Husky loves her time there with the other dogs & also is loving to the entire staff. I trust & respect each staff member there. The vibe is always relaxed & fun loving. My dog even enjoyed her expert grooming there. You can watch your best friend having fun on their video cam at all times.
Dog E Den provides the perfect day for your dog in every way possible...try it!</Review>< date>

This place is the best! We have a husky who has been going there since she was 5 months and she loves it. Everyone who works there is so wonderful and if anything happens they let me know right away. My husband and i are both doctors and they were able to help us with dog sitting when they were closed for covid. I can’t recommend it enough.< /text>

We took our dog here. Free trial. The staff was friendly and they answered our questions. We were hesitant because our puppy loves other dogs but he also needs a lot of human interaction and I wanted to make sure that he would get the attention needed.
For us, our dog is just not cut out for daycare. But based on our initial experience, we were pretty happy.< /Text>

As a dog lover I had some of the most fun I've ever had here by just looking through the glass and watching the dogs. The staff is very friendly and I feel comfortable giving them my dog. I just wish they had a viewing area so I could sit and watch my dog play with all the dogs.< /text>

<Review>Not impressed. By this place  it good  but I would not take my dog there
The owners respond of I no longer work there is True BUT I quit after two weeks !!! For many reasons one I applied to an overnight postion was CONSTANTLY give day time shifts after several conversations with  Mangers also after working for a few day cares in my past found the space to be good but did not agree with Dog management policy’s this review was reposted due to the owners misleading remark that I don’t work there I QUITE for the above reasons< /Review>< response>

<text>My dog really feels the love her. After trying some day care that left me disappointed I'm sticking with then. L love the way they pamper my winter and they don't mind me calling to check on my Winter and they take the time to answer my questions and to make sure she has been fed and the food is organic as well so I know my Winter is healthy. She is usually shy and not very sociable with other dogs but she is happy here. She gets groom and always smell good.  She always comes back very happy and tired which is ok with mamma... definitely a good place to recommend.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

< Review>
My chihuahua Mia loves to go to Dog-E-Den. She’s an elderly pup so she doesn’t play around too much but being around the other little guys definitely puts a smile on her face. And she loves the attention she gets from all the wonderful handlers! I also brought her here for some grooming and we had a great experience.<//Review>

Dog-E-Den was amazing from beginning to end. Ive called several places and dog-e-den’s employees were by far the most polite over the phone, I knew from that moment this place was different. I just spent my first day in daycare and I was just as impressed with the facility.  Definitely will be back.

Dog-E-Den keep up the good work!</review>

<user>116197135922701884658<//user><Review>Dog-E-Den is the best. Our two puppies have always had the best time there! It is the only daycare I feel truly comfortable leaving our dogs at. The staff is always available to communicate about the pups throughout the day and our dogs come home tired and happy. One of our pups gets so excited when we get there in the morning his whole body wiggles and he looses the ability to walk straight. Our dogs clearly feel how they feel at home, loved and safe, at Dog-E-Den. Dog-E-Den is the exception not the rule when it comes to daycares, they honestly care about dogs and it shows.< /Review>< Rate>

I️ am so happy with Dog E Den. I️ am traveling this week and have my puppy staying here for a few days. They send me a report card every day with pictures of my puppy and notes on how he is doing and interacting with the other dogs and if I️ want to check in him I️ can see videos on their webcams on the website. I️ am glad he is having such a good time and he is so well taken care for. I️ love the extra-mile that Dog E Den takes to keep me in the loop on my puppy!< /text>

We brought her to 2 other day cares in the area before here and this is definitely our first choice for a variety of reasons. Our puppy runs to the door as soon as we pull into the parking lot and can't wait to get inside.They keep the really big dogs separate from the small dogs so the small dogs aren't at risk of being injured and there seems to be plenty of space for all of the dogs to run around and play. It's great that they send you daily report cards with updates and pictures on how your dog is doing since I'll admit, I had a hard time leaving her and was worried about how she would do. There are also webcams so you can see the dogs play for themselves. Definitely bring your pooch here!<//text><date>1484953663156<//date>< gmap_id>

<review>First I want to say that the 1 and 2 star reviews are made by people that don’t even have dogs...
Second if there is a dog Heavan... Dog-E-Den is it. My little Rambo almost likes this place more than his own home! I would even start staying here If I didn’t have to work, it’s seriously top of the line, all the employees are super respectul, always greet you when you walk in, Daniel (manager or owner) is one of the most honest and straight forward people you’ll meet, and you can’t find that anymore in LA, so thanks for being here guys!

This is the only place I’ve used since it opened maybe a little over a year ago.... Basically... IF YOU HAVE A DOG or PuP, BRING THEM HERE!!!
You will not regret it and you will thank me :)
All my Holiday needs... they’ll take care of no problem! Rambo looks forward to meeting a new friend!</review>< Pics>

<Review>Dog-E-den is an outstanding facility, that has a doggie cam where pet parents can watch their dogs having a ball and getting socialized with other dogs.  Love this place! The dog handlers are just superb. It appears that the only negative review is based upon a breed specific political agenda.  Apparently, this reviewer has posted duplicate negative reviews on another review site, and all of those reviews were removed by that website for violating their terms of service.  Rightfully so.  If this reviewer has a problem with insurance regulations or breed specific legislation, he ought to spend his time taking it up with the legislature, rather than posting bad reviews for an outstanding business...sad really.<//Review><time>1478831208722< /time>< userid>

Food is fast and decently priced but it was a little off for me. I had the honey walnut prawns and it felt like the prawns were under fried so the breaded part was a bit doughy. However the pan fried noodles were good< /review>

I admire this place! They give sensational meals, they have a rich menu, The chief cook in that place is very trained, I enjoy a lot tasting all their food. The food is always good, the attitude towards the visitors  is agreeable. I visit often this place and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend it to all my friends.< /Review>

<Text>This restaurant is my favorite. I visit plenty of restaurants but to this one I go the most. The team is very chummy and the food they cook is so appetizing. I never miss an opportunity to have a nice dinner in this restaurant. I recommend this place with pleasure.< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
Ordered food to go and the House special chow mein tasted, smelt , and looked horrible. The egg rolls only have cooked cabbage in them and rice tasted worse than Panda Express and I don’t like they’re  rice , The orange chicken was good but not great. Was not worth my money of 36$.</Review>

<Text>An amazing place to get some local Chinese food. Staff is very friendly in this humble little restaurant. I tend to mostly call in order for pick up and they're always on time and correct! The food is far superior than fast food places. Their orange chicken is by far my favorite item of theirs. It's fairly inexpensive and you get great food with great service! Never been disappointed from all the times I've been!<//Text><user_id>105354089727115841205<//user_id><user_name>Ebony Walker<//user_name><Gmap_id>0x808437bf58d5e789:0x3a5f8b54cebb3e79< /Gmap_id>< resp>

This place was horrible! I don’t know who is writing these reviews but clearly someone paid. The food is of low grade and has no flavor. I bought lemon chicken that you couldn’t even taste lemon. I’m so mad and disappointed I really wanted good Chinese. I’ll have to try the next place. Don’t waste your money!</Review>

<review>I just called to order delivery and was planning on getting one of there family meals. I asked what my options were with the meal and was told I'm to busy to talk to you find it online. First off I've never been to this restaurant ever in my life. Second the menu on line doesn't give you your options for the entrees for the family meals. She was by far the rudest person I've ever tried to order food from and I will never eat here. Anyone who is too busy to tell you what you're paying for 2 minutes after they open shouldn't be working in customer service. If you're planning on getting delivery from here I hope you don't have any questions because they don't have time for you.<//review>< pictures>

Don't let the simple decor or the cheap red and white checkerboard picnic tablecloths fool you. This place definitely feels like a hidden gem of a restaurant. The lunch special is available seven days a week and the price to portion ratio for dine-in was superb. Fresh broccoli chicken and chow mein, I don't think I've seen such a large helping of delicious, tender chicken.

I don't have experience with either the owner or the take-out, but for a quiet lunch in the middle of a rainy Saturday, a mid-day meal for two of us filled bellies and was delightfully relaxing.<//text>

I had a very enjoyable meal from Sky Dragon Restaurant.
I had a nice spread ordered for the evening consisting of egg rolls, hot and sour soup, BBQ pork, black bean chicken, orange beef, chow mein, and these little crab puff things.
The egg rolls were crisp.  The hot and sour soup was tasty and not too thick, which is a problem with a lot of restaurants I try.
The entrees were good!  I was especially pleased with the orange beef.  It was very good, not greasy, or bland, or dry, like many places I've eaten at.  The black bean chicken was spot on, as was the BBQ pork, so good with the snow peas!
The chowmein was perfect.  Nice and tender, soft and moist, but not soggy.  So many places have noodles that are dry and stringy.
The crab puff was good, too, but I've never had those before, so I can't compare.
Overall, this was a nice surprise for the day.  I was so sick of the local options closest to me.  If I had to eat one more greasy, overcooked and undercooked, poorly prepared, mushy meal that tasted of cornstarch and failure I was prepared to just give up on local Chinese food!  I'm glad I tried Sky Dragon!< /review>

Stopped by after work for some take out food. It’s a quaint little corner building that is small on the inside, but full of personality! The food was prepared quickly (orange chicken/beef veggies/chow mein/egg rolls/wor wonton soup). I think the price was good and the quality was excellent! Other reviewers have said the food wasn’t flavorful. I would like to point out that the food isn’t overbearing with the msg/salt, which was refreshing compared to other Chinese restaurants. The service was also pleasant, so no complaints there. I think one opportunity for improvement would be to make the portions bigger.<//Text>

<Text>This is our new spot! From walking in the door to last bite great experience. The women who took our order was great, spot was clean and had a homey, Moms kitchen feel to it. Menu is amazing, huge variety with great prices, we are seriously looking forward to trying all the dishes. We have 4 kids and they never all agree on something however they all loved the food. Portions are bigger than most and you can taste the quality, fresh ingredients and as silly as this sounds, you taste the love put in it. Whoevers cooking cares about putting out a quality product. So, if your looking for a spot that has a family feel where it's like a Aunt or Mom is frying you up some food this is the spot.< /Text>< name>

Anna on Mondays ... excellent attitude, service, and humor. The best Walnut chicken of any restaurant in Santa Rosa. I've been dining here since this store originally (18yrs) opened & by far Sky Dragon is superior in every way since taking over. Fresh and tasty!!< /text>

Typical menu with many choices. Lunch specials are reasonable ($8-$9) and the regular menu entrees run from $9-$17. They offer family combination dinners for 2 or more. I won't say I was wow'd by the food, but it is consistently good; something you can't say about every place you eat. My take-out was hot even after I got home, was made fresh and very flavorful. If the item was suppose to be crispy it was, same with spicy or orange flavored, etc. I would recommend and will be back myself!

the food is very good and the delivery service is very friendly and easy to use. If you're in the Santa Rosa area use grub hub for easy ordering.</review>

Spent about $80 on takeout. None of the food had ANY flavor!! No one wanted to eat it.  Eggs rolls were just cabbage no flavor & only gave us a tiny container of dipping sauce for 8 egg rolls,  sweet & sour chicken, no flavor, garlic chicken, no flavor, chow mein, no flavor, orange chicken, asked for mild spice & no sesame seeds, was spicy with sesame seeds, sweet & sour pork was ok. The best thing was bbq pork fried rice.. We ended up going to the park & giving it to homeless ppl. Was a total waste of our money..<//Text>

My grandson and I placed an order at 630 pm.
Here it is after 930 and we never recieved our food. We didnt order online we called directly as we always do. As a loyal customer i am offended that they didnt want to compensate for their own mistake. I was offered one free entree. However we ordered almost 50 dollars worth of food. . . The audacity of them as a business to not fix the issue is ridiculous. I will never eat here again. I wouldnt be so mad however, the thing is. We called several times in between and they assured us the food was on the way... liars. Thieves. And cheats. Now nothing is open and i do not own a motor vehicle to go buy groceries. Im offended by this place.<//Text>

<review>Excellent customer service and quite knowledgeable staff. If they don't know the answer to something, they actually try and find the answer. Carquest carries a lot of parts that O'Reilly's and AutoZone don't. Remember though, this particular location is a small one. Most likely the part isn't kept in store due to space limitations but 9 times out of 10, they can order it in.<//review>< Pics>

My online order was split into two stores, which is not issue. I picked up my items from CarQuest on Columbia, and they were very helpful and checked my ID etc, great service. However, on my second half of the order I had to go to Car quest on Mission, and was flat out denied my items. Which were less than $40 worth. I had to call corporate to cancel the half of the order, which took over an hour. I then had to go back in store and pay for everything cash while my items hadn't been refunded yet. All while the same girl who denied my items keeps throwing in my face that the name on the online order is different (because I used PayPal to pay) all while I'm just trying to get my three items and leave. Wasted time and money. Definitely not doing anymore online orders through CarQuest.< /review>

The app is cool but it is just not for me so i would say if u like to do hands on stuff DON'T get this app! But if u are into that kind of stuff this  is a great app that u should get. P.S don"t make your dreams into memes :0< /review>

<Review>Perfect for student learning. And if you think this is a horrible website, I'll tell you that you have no education. This website was specifically for teachers and students. I am one myself a student that is. And I absolutely love this website. 20 out of 10 for education to help students learn. Thank you.< /Review>< Pics>

<rate>1</rate><review>I've been a student that has been using this platform, I figured that almost the 8 out of 10 will just mess around and not learn anything.  They say that its boring and very annoying when you fail a quiz and have to do the whole 10 hour tutorial again, my opinions are that maybe something is better by if the teacher actually involves the students instead of just tell them what to do.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Our teacher has enslaved us and forced us to work on this website for his points. However despite the fact that I am sleepy and my eyes are burning from chemical radiation, I would recommend this site to people who want to learn about topics your teacher picks for you. But after a while, it does get repetitive. All the typing, clicking, and reading really starts to give you hysteria after a while. Being absolutely honest, after doing this everyday for 50 minutes, I would give this website a 3/5 stars because you just keep doing the same thing over and over again for virtual points that you cannot spend.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>People are giving this a trash review because it has to do with school work but there probably lazy and failing some of their classes. I personally think this is a great app for getting into websites like big ideas math or reading plus without a password. Don't listen to these immature kids that say it sucks because it doesn't. They are just too lazy to work.</review>< username>

The school district I currently attend (Vacaville Unified School District) began utilizing Clever this past August. I really am not sure why, because the website is absolutely useless. All it does is direct you to websites that are more useful to you. Why use the software when you can just bookmark pages, especially if you're using Google Chrome (which is what VUSD uses)? Hopefully people will realize the uselessness of Clever and stop using it. (By the way, the district does not require students to use Clever. I just think it's a garbage site.)< /review>

I think that clever is sometimes hard but its a lot of fun and it helps you learn new things and don`t have to type that much to get in and you can play games and move up levels from 1-18 and i`m on level 16 and its not that hard and its lots of fun and you can do as many  minutes as you want its so much fun and you can have fun with clever you should use clever and helps you spell and see how fast you can read some times only maybe you can pas some levels< /review>

<text>I am in middle school, and I find this site very useful! If you have a Clever account, but forgot your login for BrainPop or Canvas, you can easily sign in through Clever.  Looking at other people's reviews has shown me that many of the bad reviews are just because they dislike doing school work and getting it done. I have nothing against that, although I think that this website is made well to help you learn more. One thing they could fix is the layout. For me, I just get kinda confused. There's a lot of icons on the page, and there are times that I have accidentally clicked the wrong thing. I suggest a simple redesign of the page, but I still think the page is set up well.
Thank you, producers of Clever! You are helping many people learn more worldwide.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Review>False advertising!
There's no $1.00 bacon cheeseburger at this place.
The cashier declined to honor the price and mentioned that the bacon cheeseburger price was $1.29.
I had to pay extra just because I wanted to give it a try, but besides the price gouging the cheeseburger was horrible.
Big disappointment.  I am never coming back to this place.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>BK is a fast food giant, no doubt about it, but I've had some unlucky experiences with trying to get some dipping sauces for sure though, they ask you what condiments you want, and by the time you're pulling out of the drive way, bam! No sauces for your chicken fries 😓 all in all, they got some good deals and good food.<//Review><user_id>117253067530037515318<//user_id>< Response>

The service was okay I only bought a large soda. The parking is a good size. I was going to order then I went across the street for tacos from the street vendor.</Text>

< Review>
I walked for 30 minutes just to get to this Burger King. I arrived at 8:45 pm and they refused to take my order because they were closing even though their closing time is at 10:00.  Fix the schedules then bruh.< /Review>

Wow. Just wow. Let me just start off with the employees. Customer service here is beyond me. Off the bat exceeded my expectations. One minute you are ordering for a whole village and the next you are leaving the store with a huge smile on your little belly. How'd they do it you may ask? Well, the secret really is team work. The store is not just filled with employees, but a family. It's truly beautiful how much motivation these employees get from their managers. I've seen how well the managers make sure to keep the employees on task, even when they themselves, aren't having a good day. enriqueThe food here is as always, top notch. The store is always clean and sanitized. I mean for crying out loud! They have a big sign on the wall with an "A" on it! But, nonetheless you must see it to believe it. So I encourage you to stop by and experience it for yourself. God Bless.</text>

<review>Always friendly staff and a go-to place for a meal near work. Very visible from the road within proximity to a small shopping center, and this place has a playpen. This location has existed for at least two decades (I believe) if not longer, so it is well established. The staff is multilingual and the service is very quick, even during peak hours. And the food quality is great. The parking is free and there are at least ten spots that I've noticed, if not more. I've never needed to use the drive-thru, but there is one.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Since the burgers are flame broiled, it taste lean to me (probably because the fat drips away during cooking).< /review>

<text>The guy at the counter is fast and has good customer service, but I could see the lady making my breakfast burrito and she sucks, she was having a full on conversation with another female and took for ever to make my burritos, when the guy asked her for the burritos she gave him attitude and replied its heating up, if she hadn't  of been blabbering her mouth off it would of been a more pleasant experience.</text>< Pictures>

Bought a burger full of hair. I think I’m a fair person so 1 strand of hair I’ll see as a mistake or accident. But this thing had at least 4 different strands of hair.</Review>

I came to the store and noticed the restrooms needed a token to open the door. I went to the counter and spoke with Mary Lou "Store Manager" about getting a token to open the restroom door.

She asked me if I had a quarter, because that's what it would take to open the door. I asked her that the door said I could request a token. She then asked me if I was planning to buy some food! I said well, I need to use the restroom and then I would be willing to buy some food at that moment.

She made it a point when she went to the door that if I had a quarter she wouldn't have to come over and use the key to open the door for me! She seemed to be too wrapped up with whatever she was doing and it looked like it was some kind of paperwork! All she had to do was just either give me a token or open the door as she did!

Afterwards, I came to the counter to purchase some food! Mary Lou, was there but asked her fellow employee to take my order. Although she was there at the register she didn't want to assist me!

While I was eating, I happened to spill something on my shirt. I asked the other manager there if I could get you the restroom token or if he can let me in! I also asked him if he was going to give me the third degree like the other manager did.

He asked me what had happened and I explained what had happen with Mary Lou. What I spoke with the other manager, Alberto had appeared to find out that he was not considered the actual manager of the store! That in fact Mary Lou was his manager!

He felt bad with what actually happened and you open the door for me for the restroom! Then apparently he spoke with Mary Lou to see what had happened! He came to me afterwards when I was sitting in the dining room and asked me exactly again once more what was the situation! He felt bad about the entire situation, but I told him that this is what she said to me and I didn't really understand why it was necessary!

He explained to me that they were having some problems with the restrooms with some of the customers that came in that didn't actually purchase any food. He also said that there was a problem with things like graffiti and damage to the restroom as well! I explained to him, that I understood the situation because I did work for the restaurant industry in my past years!

He informed that they were getting direction from the actual owner of this Burger King location! That they were not to allow people to go into the restrooms unless they were customers! And I understood this, but I told him that they way Mary Lou approached it was not correct! Her attitude, was not the correct way to approach or explain this to a customer that was purchasing food later in their store.

As I noticed while I was in the store it appeared that Mary Lou the manager was not exactly a very nice person in the first place! I noticed that she was short-tempered and she didn't seem to be very friendly with the employees! The problem is, that if you want to be in a position like this you need to understand that you do need to be open to hearing what other people have to say. And I do not feel that Mary Lou is possibly the best manager for this location! However this is my opinion!

Alberto, the other manager wanted to make it right! He asked me if there was anything I could do, I already told him that I already ate my meal and I wasn't really hungry for anything else! He did offer me an opportunity with a gift card for return visit if I was interested in coming back to the store. I am formed him, that I would consider coming back to the store if I'm back in the area because he was being very polite about this!

My experience of the store wasn't exactly the best. However Alberto was definitely a much better manager, you understand the point of you that I was talking to him about! And I feel that he should be the manager of the store!<//Text>

French toast over cooked returned them twice,  changed to a sandwich bacon was mostly crumbs bread appears to have mold . I was told if I get more FT it would be the same because it is time cooked.. So you just overcook your food instead of adjusting cooker? No thanks< /review>

Worst experience ever, bad service, old burguers, bad attitude on workers. I sent my younguest son 11yrs old boy to buy breakfast with a $20 bill and the lady named Rosa said he gave her 2 $5 bill and she did not give him the change $10 to him, I went to see what was happened and she told me that she did not have any $20 bill, my son told me she hide the $20 bill under the register machine. She just had ruined my mothers day!!😡😡< /review>
