<text>I went to this shop to buy a new tire. The tire was in good condition so I figured this might be the new shop I go to whenever I need any tire related work done. Anyways, I ended deciding to upgrade my suspension system. I bought some performance struts and thought it'd be a good idea to come here to have them installed. About 4 months later I start hearing a loud clicking noise coming from the front end of my car. One day as I'm driving the driver side strut finally came loose and whenever I'd turn, a loud screeching noise would be made. I thought the strut was defective, but when I went to a different shop to have the "defective" ones replaced, they told me they were still good and holding pressure. All in all this shop did not install them correctly. Would not recommend!!<//text>< pics>

<Review>Been here since they opened. Car has been here over A week. Workers lied that the owner wasn't there which he actually was. Didn't want to give my money back, didn't want to fix my car. Asked me to wait. Wanted to give my rims to someone else. Then I see my rims and the owner to lies and say they were for someone else. At the end of the day because I'm just leaving Rims finally on and have rest of the money back. Poor customer service. Employees standing around smoking Weed. Would NOT recommend then to NO ONE!!!</Review><Time>1558403957849</Time></record>

These guys will take care of whatever you need. I was overdue for a tire rotation. One of my tires had uneven wear, yet my other three had good tread to last me at least 8-10k miles. America’s Tire Co and Mels wouldn’t do it and tried to up sell me a new set. I drove to Bay Area Tires & Wheels and in 15 min they had them rotated and I was on my way. Worth the $40 charge, and I was able to get every mile out of those old Continentals.</Text>

I was referred to this shop from one of my friends. I came in to replace my tires and they gave me a great deal with an alignment too. My car drives super smooth now. They were busy, but they still got me in and out quick. Great service and I will be back some rims soon :)<//Text>

<text>Do not go to this shop!!! Total scam went to it for tires they ended up damaging my hoses under the car to cause coolant leaks. Had 0 issues before with the car soon as I left this place car started overheating. Not one drop of oil in my garage before and the guy had the nerve to say I have a small leak and should bring it to them or they can “recommend” someone to fix it, a scam and joke!  It took them 3 days to clear a rack for me to get an alignment job done which I was charged for upfront on the first day. I was told over the phone it would be $389 for new tires and ended up paying $500 plus left with a broken car! I wish I never went there dont make the same mistake!</text><date>1589838507974< /date><Rate>1<//Rate><UserId.>111083348457196728759</UserId.>< pictures>

<review>They changed their name to Bay Area Tires And wheels, they are called Bayfair Tires & Wheels in Yelp(2.5 star true reviews!) so they can get away with bad reviews. They sell bended used wheelset to customer and lied to me says it in great condition. I realized it right after I asked other car shop to do the wheel balance before I install the them.

<review>I came here last week in hope of getting a used tire because of a flat that I had. They tested my tire/and rim and said my rim was cracked. I got a new rim from the dealership ($530). I went to another tire shop to get a tire for the new rim and had them test the old rim so I can fix it and keep it as a spare. Comes to find out the old rim was never cracked and I spent $590 instead of $60 because of their poor service.< /review>< Pictures>

Front desk people very nice and try to be helpful however the owner Alex is not accountable for his bussiness they have great prices and helpful staff and being an operations Manager I understand there can be delay but my tires never showed up and once they were 3 days late I had to go elsewhere as I had a road trip. I told 11 times my my deposit would be returned  to it has been over a week and they have not submitted the refund to my account yet. Alex YOU owe me $300 dollars please promptly return my money as you did not provide goods or services.<//Review>

Had four new tires put on my Cadillac Deville. Out the door it was $300, not bad. Only issue I had was them not calling me back when they got the tires in stock. Had to go down there a wait. If it wasn't for that I'd give them five stars.< /Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Very irresponsible customer service. No SHAME in giving runaround. They left one wheel of a brand new installation of wheels and tires under inflated and immediately leaving their place I feel an extremely hard knock over a some rough road and bent the rim. They claimed the pothole caused the dent but doesn't explain that the tire was flat but when they re-inflated the tire there was no leak or damage. If a pothole caused tire to go flat and dent then the tire should have been damaged to go flat but it wasnt..
I compromised and they offered a new wheel at their cost which I said fine....for weeks I got runaround on the wheel arriving..It wasnt gonna cost them anything to remedy what happened happened to my brand new wheel and they couldn't come thru with what they agreed to.

Worst part was when after 6 weeks they said they had the wheel and I went down to pick it up. When I got there they tell me that it was at the warehouse. So i wasted a trip there and ask them to call me when the brought it to shop. Never got call and never got wheel. How do you have it one day and not be able to produce it after that....I FINALLY GAVE UP.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808f91d1e68ca2bd:0x147d811bbf406e8</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>On May 22,18. I took my car there for brakes and tires. Was told my car was ready. Then the mechanic hit 2 parked cars on the lot. He said the brakes felled. 2 weeks later the owner has felled to give myself or the other owner any information. He doesn't have insurance at this location. I have been a customer for years and don't deserve to be treated like this. It's very sad. However I will get justice!!!!<//text>< time>

I don't know how this place is still in business.  Worst experience ever. Took over 2 hours to replace my tires from start to finish. I waited and watched the struggle the entire time.

Brought my car in at 5pm, they close at 6pm. Dude assured me they would be done by closing. I finally left a little after 7:30pm, honestly not feeling comfortable after seeing them work on my car that the job was done right but after waiting so long I just wanted to go home in hopes these guys know what they are doing.

First we'll start off that one tire wasn't even on all the way, If I don't notice before driving off they would have never corrected it. They replaced a metal valve stem with a cheap rubber one because their machine broke my original one. I saw them wrenching on my wheel and the guy said my TPS sensor was loose but it was the actual valve stem they screwed up.

I drove home and on the freeway it felt like my wheels where going to fall off with the steering wheel shake and vibration so I exited and stopped at the nearest gas station. All my wheel lugs were there so I checked the tires and come to find out they gave me a different brand tire than what I paid for!!!

I'm assuming they didn't balance my wheels so I'm going to have to go back tomorrow to have this all corrected but their shop is so out of wack I'm almost considering going somewhere else just to make sure it's done right.

I ended up taking the streets home just to be safe.

To top it off, right when I got home and pulled in my driveway the TPMS sensor light came on...  I won't be surprised if I wake up tomorrow with a flat tire..<//Text>

Update- Took an actual representative from the state of California to go there twice to force them to write me a check for $100. Avoid this business at all cost. They will avoid you and your claims at all cost.

LIARS AND THIEVES! Took a deposit, told me the wheels were “on the way”, “on the next shipment”, on “a pallet in the warehouse”. After six weeks, ordered wheels from another dealer after they told me they would return my deposit. Chased the owner, "Patricia" for a few weeks until she took my credit card info and promised same day return. No return of deposit. Had to file a complaint with the Alameda County DA's office who is pursuing fraud charges against the company/owner. Will post an update. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!<//Text>

I came in there just to swap my tires in for some new ones that I bought somewhere else, and the people there are not professional at all. This skinny Mexican guy I think his name is Juan and some white guy a little on the bigger side. They both stepped to the back but it was abvios what they were doing and you could smell it too they where smoking weed. So this guy juan was working on my car under the influence this is so dangerous I’m never coming back. I wouldn’t recommend this place at all. Don’t buy tire from them either they are cheap china tires one small pop hole will lol these or blow them out and they won’t even give warranty on them< /review>

<Review>Do not buy tires here. They are selling inferior tires. I bought a set of 225/40R18 Nanking tires that wobble at freeway speeds. I took them to several tire shops, paying them to balance them, until I found a reputable tire shop that showed me these tires were out of round. Stay away from Bayfair Tire and Wheel.< /Review>< user>

<review>Wow, where do I begin?

This easily has to be some of the worst service I've had to work with. I work for a collision shop and had to order a set of wheels for a customer through this tire shop as it was where the customer had originally gotten their wheels.

Well, the wheels we needed were discontinued, which is not their fault. And they did initially help me get a couple different options for our customer to choose from. We decided on a new style, got them special ordered in the same size for all 4 wheels because the car was AWD (this is important later on) and waited for the shipping. They told me about 3-4 business days, no problem.

And here is where the issues begin. As we start to pull apart the old wheels and tires so we could re-use the good tires, we notice something strange. The wheels that were on the car were two different sizes in width! Even though the tires were the same size all around. Now, these wheels are meant to be a replica of some Mercedes wheels that are for a RWD car, which in that case staggering the wheel size like that is okay. However on an AWD drive car this is NOT okay. Putting different sizes of wheels on an AWD car can severely damage the transmission and differentials. Not to mention that since the tires were all the same size, 2 of them were being stretch fit, which is unsafe.

But hey, whatever, we're fixing that with putting 4 same size wheels on.

Now cut to when the wheels were supposed to have arrived. I call them asking where the wheels are, and they say they haven't shown up, they'll be in tomorrow. Okay, no biggie. Tomorrow comes, i call again and the wheels are in! Awesome, they say they'll deliver them that day.

Welp, it's nearly the end of the day and still no wheels. I call in to ask what's up and I get told that actually our wheels are not in. But wait, I was told that they were in just that morning right? Apparently not.

This happens multiple times over the course of multiple days. The customer, Estimator, and I are getting increasingly upset aout how this situation is being handled.

But finally! After nearly 10 business days we get our wheels, get them mounted and get the customer on their way...or so we thought. We get a call back that a little AMG sticker that goes on the wheel (which was in the photo we were sent by them to show our customer) isn't on the wheel. We never received them so I call again.

Person at Bayfair says they don't usually send them out but she'll throw them in an envelope and mail them to us no problem.....It's now been a month and still no AMG sticker. I've called 3 times today and apparently no one there is willing to help. What a joke.

I cannot recommend this shop to anyone because the service I received was an absolute joke and extremely dismissive.<//review>< pics>

<review>My family is from Iowa and we were staying at the Best Western a block away. We actually have several authentic Mexican restaurants where I live that have raving reviews. We stopped into this little place when we were in Long Beach and I must say that these were hands down the best tacos that I have ever had. The rest of my family agreed as well. We also had the pizza. It was decent as well. Prices were very cheap too. We also visited purchased some convenience items as well and everything was as expected.< /review>< pics>

<Time>1626835649017<//Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I have my teeth cleaned at the Perio & Implant Center, alternating with visits to my regular dentist.  I had developed a crack in a very old root canal that failed.  Dr. Pechak replaced the tooth with an implant, which was much less scary and uncomfortable than I had anticipated.  Almost two years later, the new tooth is doing fine; it's the best tooth in my mouth!

The next procedure will be grafts to the gums of two teeth to fix thinning and receding that's endangering the stability of the teeth.  I was pleased to read positive reviews from others who had this procedure.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808fa4cd1678991b:0x1c2b89e8618fd543</GmapID></record>

<Review>My 10-year old implant tooth got badly infected. Dr. Pechak took it out, removed the infected tissue and put in new bone graft using Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) method. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is categorized as autologous blood concentrates, which are blood products made using the patient’s own blood. Dr. Pechak is among the few practicing bone graft procedures using PRF, which I think is the best method. I’m about two months into healing now and infections are gone. I would highly recommend Dr. Pechak if you need complex periodontal operations!<//Review>< pictures>

Overall - positive experience with the dentist.  However, you might want to let your referring dentists know that you have moved your location and update the forms they are handing out.  Also, when checking out, please make sure your support team has the correct patient dental insurance and not another patient's info.  OOPS!</Text>

I had second round lanap. Dr Pechak is compassion and skillful person, he listen to your concerns before the procedure. I had been couple of dental office lately nobody tells me that’s i am getting teeth problems because of periodontatis , but Pechak listen my problem and gave me what is the source of my problems. So far i am doing good, hopefully It will be successful by end of third month.< /text>

<Review>I had an app with Dr Pechak. I sat waiting for one hour in the surgery room then decided to just walk out.  Staff kept coming with various excuses. "It will be 2 minutes"...then I waited another 30 min. Apparently the previous patient was having some (serious?) complications. The place feels run down and not clean, the surgery chair  I sat on was so old it had cracks in it.  After 40 min they realized they had to suddenly talk to my dentist although I had brought the referral letter with all the details. When I left no-one said anything other than "I guess we'll have to re-schedule", no apology even. On top of that the sign in form is very dubious with questions like "What is your partner's social security number?" or "What is the address of a relative that does not live with you?". I will look for another place with competent individuals.<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
Dr Pechak is an absolute master, skilled beyond belief, with decades of experience and the very latest techniques.  READ THIS + SEE PHOTOS IF YOU HAVE GUM RECESSION AND WILL GRAFT OR PINHOLE!! I would not hesitate, there is no-one better in U.S, forget Silicon Valley. I have just completed my 5mo x2 procedures for gum graft.  I consider offices that do not follow his state-of-the-art techniques to be living in the past.

He is by far one of the very best doctors I have ever experienced. I should start by saying I am very fussy and particular.  I have a moderate pain tolerance, I suffer from anxiety before a treatment and research well before I take the chance on any new doctor. I went to him with severe recession and I specifically wanted to have pinhole technique. I had already had traditional graft once before on one-side and was unhappy, having had an extremely difficult recovery. I pinned my hopes on him and he delivered what I wanted, but rightfully outlined that I needed the traditional grafting method on the top and was eligible for pinhole on the bottom. He made a plan to treat both sides of my mouth, in two stages, over 5 months apart.

I am now 5 days post my second surgery in writing and I could not be happier. He is straightforward, direct and honest. He photographs everything, walks you through and explains everything and puts you at ease.  It was important for me to write this after the second surgery so I could test the consistency and the recovery.

Unlike other doctors, he does not cut and stitch the palette (which is a nightmare). Instead, he makes a precise, very small incision on the side that the tissue is being grafted from in roof and then places a plastic mouth guard over the entire roof (made to measure) – not one suture in roof! This plastic guard sits there for 24 hours after surgery. You simply pop it off 24 hours later, and you are healed. To expedite this, they take blood and centrifuge it and add it to the wound during surgery. You will not believe how quickly you heal. After 24 hours, you can go about your business. Even drinking and eating=zero irritation. Anywhere else, lives in the past and is dated if they do not do it like this when the tech is available!!

The pinhole is equally amazing. He adds stitches to the pinhole surgery, so there is a small modification to the Chao technique – which I love! This is even easier than the traditional graft – just collagen filled in through a small hole. Very little pain or discomfort.  The sutures help to keep it in place and I have achieved results that are fantastic! If you qualify for this, have it done!! Dr Pechak will assess as needed.

I have the traditional graft + pinhole done in one session (having now had it done twice). Both times, the consistency of the surgery was amazing. I have healed beautifully, I was back to work after a couple of days of rest, and I had controlled swelling.  The instructions are clear and concise.

Finally, Dr Pechak and his entire staff care – deeply –  that you have good results, you heal, you feel happy and are comfortable. I consider them to be caregivers, not just a doctors office. Clarissa who deals with your insurance is unbelievable at her job – she is diligent, kind, caring, makes sure all your paperwork is in order and explains everything like a pro. She is fantastic and has been a rock for me through the process. Nidhi who runs the front desk is again so sweet, kind and attentive to your needs. When you arrive, they greet you so warmly – it  makes all the difference to have them hold your hand through this process! You realize that its not just about the doctor but their entire team. Nurses, equally fantastic and chat with you, talk you through everything and settle you in nicely.
I attach three photos for you to see:
1. Right - Shows the right side healing 5 days after surgery
2. Left - Shows left side after 5 months
3. Shows Left side 5 days after surgery
The ones after 5 days are early in healing, showing you how much coverage was achieved,  how it settles and heals 5 months down the line!</Review>

About 4~5 years ago, I had 3 loose molar teeth and regular gum bleeding problem. I couldn't eat well and had toothache very often.  Luckily, I met Dr. Pechak. He did laser operation on my gum which stopped the bleeding. Later, I got my first implant to my lower right molar from Dr. Pechak. It was an excellent job! I didn't feel much pain during the operation. The tooth worked the same as my original tooth without any problem during past 4 years! It helped me to build up high confidence on Dr. Pechak's professional expertise. So I received the 2nd and 3rd implants from him in past 3 years. All the implants are successful as expected. There is no issue to any of the implants so far. No extra maintenance work except regular tooth cleaning. Now I enjoy eating everyday! No more toothache!<//text>

Doctor Pechak is extremely talented Dental Surgeon. Dr. Pechak and his staff are very courteous and very friendly.
He uses latest technology and an expert in teeth Implants and laser surgery of the gums.
Two weeks back, I had five implants for my teeth and the surgery went so well that I did not bleed just after the surgery and I was ready to go to work the next day. In less than 2 weeks, I am completely healed with no pain whatsoever.

I would highly recommend Dr. Pechak for Gum and Implant surgery. My friends who got their implant procedure somewhere else in the By Area, were in constant pain for up to 6 months and they had advised me not to go this procedure. I am very pleased that I found Dr. Pechak who is very capable of performing Impants and gum surgery without any post operative problems.</Text>

Dr. Pechak is an awesome surgeon with great hands for the delicate work of gum grafting.  His use of PRGF was amazing for the healing process of my surgical sites.  My gum grafts looked great after 1 week!!!

Dr. Pechak is on the quiet side, but he is very professional/honest, and he is an excellent surgeon.  He has a very friendly and helpful staff.  I would not hesitate to recommend my family and friends to Dr. Pechak.</Review>

I had a very pleasant experience with Dr. Pechak. He gave me all the details and answered my apprehensions before the procedure. Post-procedure he answered all my questions when I texted him even on a weekend. Dr. Pechak has soft hands and the entire procedure was not as painful as I had thought. His assistant Ms Manika was also very pleasant and had a knack of using the suction timely. The office staff is extremely friendly and they have a awesome tea/coffee bar!! Overall a pleasant experience and would strongly suggest Dr. Pechak and the LANAP procedure.</Text>

You know how you always dream about a Star Trek advanced medical future? Well that future is here and it is happening at Dr. Pechak's office.  If you have ever had flap surgery, don't ever do it again. Instead get the LANAP treatment with Dr. Pechak.  I went to Dr. Pechak years ago for laser surgery, and now go to his center whenever I need periodontal work done.  I am in the middle of a tooth replacement, and really appreciate the work they do at Dr. Pechak's office.  Dr. Pechak and his top notch staff really care about your well being and comfort, and they are incredibly professional and effective.   I had gone to another periodontist for surgery, and ended up in tears after a barbaric flap procedure on just one quadrant.  Then I found out about Dr. Pechak's laser surgery, and they were able to do the same procedure without any suffering on my part, for all the rest of the three quadrants!  Dr. Pechak really listens to your needs and understands the level of empathy you require.  From my experience,  I highly recommend Dr. Pechak and his staff.<//Text>

<Review>Dr. Pechak and his team are fantastic - truly first class service with an exceptional outcome.  I initially came in for a second opinion after my original periodontist had proposed expensive and painful traditional periodontal flap surgery on all four quadrants.  Dr. Pechak's recommendation that I would be an ideal candidate for LANAP surgery almost sounded too good to be true, as the procedure had minimal recovery time and actually came in cheaper than the traditional surgical approach.  However, 6 months later and the procedure was a resounding success, reducing pockets depths that were up 2 7, 8 and even 9mm, to healthy 2-3mm pockets, with very healthy surrounding gum tissue.

Throughout the preparation, procedure, and post-surgical check-ins, Dr. Pechak and his team were careful to answer all my questions to set my concerns at ease, and were incredibly professional throughout.  I had been putting this procedure off for years because of fears and concerns about the post-operative discomfort, and Dr. Pechak's approach using LANAP couldn't have been easier or gone better.

I would confidently recommend him for your first (and probably only) opinion if you are looking for a dentist proficient in cutting edge, highly effective approaches to treating any serious periodontal issues you are dealing with.<//Review>< Date>

I was referred to Dr. Pechak by my regular dentist after I was told by another specialist that I was not a candidate for an implant in a compromised gum area. Dr. Pechak performed a through periodontal exam and gave me a complete restoration plan including a remedy for the problem with my gums so I can get the implant needed in that area. I have a lot of issues that need to be addressed and it will take some time. I started the process about 5 weeks ago and I’m happy with my progress so far. Dr. Pechak has the latest technology and skills to expedite the plan. The office is a welcoming environment and the staff is friendly and efficient. I highly recommend The Perio & Implant Center.< /Text>

Went to Dr. Pechack to check on a potential damaged/infected tooth.  He was able to save my tooth by performing a gum transferred (not sure of the exact medical terms.). Basically he's building/adding gum to the receding gum at the location of my tooth to eliminate deep pocket.  The procedure went really well due to his exceptional work.  Dr. Pechak is very professional and very very good.  I highly recommend him for anyone who has gum issues and potential loosing your teeth.  Don't just pull out for teeth, go see Dr, Pechak first!< /review>

< Review>
I have had many implants with Dr. Pechak they are all successful.
Other periodontists were less successful.
There was one implant that didn't take, probably because I did not take the
antibiotics long enough. But Dr. Pechak redid the implant without charge.
It took. I was quite impressed.

I have a new implant in progress. Yesterday he inserted the implant which required lifting of the sinuses and added new bone material. He explained the progress at each step, assuring me that the drill bit is flat-ended and that it will not damage the sinuses, a concern of mine. The surgery was successful and uneventful.  So far so very good.

Due to the pandemic, I chose not to continue the process - for about a year. Yesterday, I continued the process at his new location. It went without any hiccup. I was surprised at the number of people who worked there - for one periodontist. It was a short routine visit.<//Review>

I had a very pleasant experience with Dr. Pechak. He gave me all the details and answered my apprehensions before the procedure. Post-procedure he answered all my questions when I texted him even on a weekend. Dr. Pechak has soft hands and the entire procedure was not as painful as I had thought. His assistant Ms Manika was also very pleasant and had a knack of using the suction timely. The office staff is extremely friendly and they have a awesome tea/coffee bar!! Overall a pleasant experience and would strongly suggest Dr. Pechak and the LANAP procedure.<//Text>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>I was Dr. Pechak’s patient 9-10 yrs ago. I remembered I had painless and uneventful gum procedures then.

Last year my x-ray showed I had a little bone loss to one of my teeth. I put off seeing a specialist because there was no discomfort (a big mistake). Earlier this month, I learnt the tooth can no longer be saved. I emailed Dr. Pechak’s office to get his opinion and have recent x-ray emailed to him. I also told his staff I am unable to make too many trips to his office as my work is quite far. They scheduled me a few days later.

I went in and Dr. Pechak thoroughly explained my situation. I went with his opinion because he is very professional and had gained my trust. Consultation and procedure took about 1.5 hours. I drove home immediately after, the procedure was painless, no post-surgery bleeding, and the recovery went smoothly. This is all due to Dr. Pechak’s exceptional work! His staff called the next day to check how I was feeling. Very thoughtful. I requested a two week follow up instead of normal one week. They have been very accommodating to all my needs.  Waiting for the bone graft to heal and will be back for the next process in a few months.

Dr. Pechak is a very gentle, knowledgeable, highly skilled, and most trusted periodontist/surgeon.
His use of PGRF seems to make the surgical site heal faster. He is an exceptional dentist who never shy away from using the latest technology for the benefit of his patients. I really appreciate his work.

Dr. Pechak and his staff are very professional, courteous, warm, and friendly.

I would go back to Dr. Pechak if I have another need for his service.< /review><name>S S< /name><userid>118235738950216712310< /userid><response>None<//response><time>1579451613134<//time>< rating>

Recently I unfortunately cracked a tooth when biting down on a piece of olive bread that contained an olive pit. When this happened I didn’t know the tooth had been damaged because it was a root canal tooth. Upon my next dental cleaning I was informed that I would need the tooth to be extracted and likely bone grafting because I already had lost bone in my jaw. My regular dentist wanted me to have this taken care of quickly. This is when I went to the Perio & Implant Center and met Dr. Bembey. This is a very nice office that is extremely well-equipped with the latest equipment from what I can gather. All of the staff are very professional and friendly, which helps a lot when the dentist chair is one of your least favorite places on Earth to be :-). Dr. Bembey is a very caring practitioner with a great chair side manner. She is trained in advanced techniques that speed healing. She extracted my tooth and performed the bone graft skillfully and with minimal pain afterwards. I didn’t experience much, if any swelling. Dr. Bembey made herself available by cell phone afterwards which was appreciated when I had a problem tolerating the antibiotics. The entire implant process will take months given the need for my bone graft to heal first. I’ve been back to the office a couple times and was treated to some laser biostimulation to help nerves heal from a totally different dental procedure that was done by my general dentist after my tooth was extracted. My regular dentist had to work on a molar to put a crown on it and the numbing from that procedure hadn’t worn off after almost a couple weeks, indicating some nerve damage or irritation from the Novocain shots my general dentist gave me. Dr. Bembey simply wanted me to heal fast and gave me two laser biostimulation sessions already. It has certainly helped and makes me think very highly of both Dr. Bembey and this office. They went above and beyond the call of duty for me.  I highly recommend this office and Dr. Bembey if you need an implant and/or periodontal treatments.</review>

About 4~5 years ago, I had 3 loose molar teeth and regular gum bleeding problem. I couldn't eat well and had toothache very often.  Luckily, I met Dr. Pechak. He did laser operation on my gum which stopped the bleeding. Later, I got my first implant to my lower right molar from Dr. Pechak. It was an excellent job! I didn't feel much pain during the operation. The tooth worked the same as my original tooth without any problem during past 4 years! It helped me to build up high confidence on Dr. Pechak's professional expertise. So I received the 2nd and 3rd implants from him in past 3 years. All the implants are successful as expected. There is no issue to any of the implants so far. No extra maintenance work except regular tooth cleaning. Now I enjoy eating everyday! No more toothache!< /Review>

<Review>Dr. Pechak is an awesome surgeon with great hands for the delicate work of gum grafting.  His use of PRGF was amazing for the healing process of my surgical sites.  My gum grafts looked great after 1 week!!!

Dr. Pechak is on the quiet side, but he is very professional/honest, and he is an excellent surgeon.  He has a very friendly and helpful staff.  I would not hesitate to recommend my family and friends to Dr. Pechak.<//Review><name>Lynn Hu<//name>< Time>

Initially, recovery was uncomfortable, but because of the PRGF technique he uses, where a patient's own plasma is used to help healing, my recovery time was faster than I expected, based on friends' experiences with other periodontists.  They had told me to expect months of recovery, but after two weeks, I was almost completely back to normal.  I'm thankful for good results, and eating normally again!

<review>Doctor Pechak is extremely talented Dental Surgeon. Dr. Pechak and his staff are very courteous and very friendly.
He uses latest technology and an expert in teeth Implants and laser surgery of the gums.
Two weeks back, I had five implants for my teeth and the surgery went so well that I did not bleed just after the surgery and I was ready to go to work the next day. In less than 2 weeks, I am completely healed with no pain whatsoever.

I would highly recommend Dr. Pechak for Gum and Implant surgery. My friends who got their implant procedure somewhere else in the By Area, were in constant pain for up to 6 months and they had advised me not to go this procedure. I am very pleased that I found Dr. Pechak who is very capable of performing Impants and gum surgery without any post operative problems.</review><resp>None<//resp><Rate>5</Rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< gmapID>

<text>Dr. Pechak and his team are fantastic - truly first class service with an exceptional outcome.  I initially came in for a second opinion after my original periodontist had proposed expensive and painful traditional periodontal flap surgery on all four quadrants.  Dr. Pechak's recommendation that I would be an ideal candidate for LANAP surgery almost sounded too good to be true, as the procedure had minimal recovery time and actually came in cheaper than the traditional surgical approach.  However, 6 months later and the procedure was a resounding success, reducing pockets depths that were up 2 7, 8 and even 9mm, to healthy 2-3mm pockets, with very healthy surrounding gum tissue.

Throughout the preparation, procedure, and post-surgical check-ins, Dr. Pechak and his team were careful to answer all my questions to set my concerns at ease, and were incredibly professional throughout.  I had been putting this procedure off for years because of fears and concerns about the post-operative discomfort, and Dr. Pechak's approach using LANAP couldn't have been easier or gone better.

I would confidently recommend him for your first (and probably only) opinion if you are looking for a dentist proficient in cutting edge, highly effective approaches to treating any serious periodontal issues you are dealing with.<//text>< pictures>

No one likes hearing that they need to have a tooth removed, and replaced with an implant. But, if you have to hear that you want to be sitting in the exam chair at Doctor Pechak office.  There is no one better in the Bay Area.

My molar had a cracked root and had to come out. It was extracted under local anesthetic in under an hour. Dr. Pechak uses state of the art equipment and advanced techniques to assure great results.

For example, Dr. Pechak uses your own healing factors from a small amount of blood he draws before the procedure. In blood plasma are palettes and other good things that make us heal. By mixing those with tiny pieces of bone and inserting that in the hole where the tooth used to be healing occurs quicker and with less chance of complications.

The proof is, I left the office with a regime of antibiotics and Motrin. I never needed more that. I had no post-surgery bleeding or pain. By the second day I was eating everything I normally do, I just had to chew on the other side of my mouth.

Dr Pechak is a perfectionist. That isn’t a good trait for a Barista making your daily latte, but it’s great when it comes to having your teeth and mouth work properly and stay healthy. There isn’t anybody I would trust more than Dr. Pechak to do that for me.

Face it, oral surgery is a big inconvenience and very costly, and in the Bay Area there are few bargains. Since you already know that you might as well choose someone who is going do the procedure in the most effective and painless way and produce great results.

My Mom used to say: be true to your teeth or they will be false to you, and my Dad used to say: pay for the best and cry only once.<//Text>

< Review>
for more than fifteen years (and this means: since i was about fifty), i have been dr peschak's client, and my experience has been overwhelmingly -- and undramatically -- positive. "overwhelmingly positive" because dr peschak's professional competence, combined with an awareness of the most recent technological possibilities, have given me the assuring certainty to be, quite literally, in the best possible odontological hands. "undramatically positive" because dr. peschak is a master in the art of age-adequate anticipation. his well-timed interventions have helped me avoid anything near an "emergency situation." rather, his care has given me the present of feeling "odentologically young" at age sixty-eight.<//Review>

<Text>I have my teeth cleaned at the Perio & Implant Center, alternating with visits to my regular dentist.  I had developed a crack in a very old root canal that failed.  Dr. Pechak replaced the tooth with an implant, which was much less scary and uncomfortable than I had anticipated.  Almost two years later, the new tooth is doing fine; it's the best tooth in my mouth!

The next procedure will be grafts to the gums of two teeth to fix thinning and receding that's endangering the stability of the teeth.  I was pleased to read positive reviews from others who had this procedure.< /Text><gmapID>0x808fa4cd1678991b:0x1c2b89e8618fd543< /gmapID></record>

<Text>I got a gum graft and it was extremely unpleasant.  Dr Pechak and his staff are friendly and professional, they made the experience as positive as can be, considering my nervousness. The office has a lovely atmosphere. I really admire that they're trying to be as paper free as possible. I definitely will recommend anyone in need of periodontal care to go here.< /Text><resp>None</resp><Rate>5</Rate>< gmapID>

<review>My 10-year old implant tooth got badly infected. Dr. Pechak took it out, removed the infected tissue and put in new bone graft using Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) method. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is categorized as autologous blood concentrates, which are blood products made using the patient’s own blood. Dr. Pechak is among the few practicing bone graft procedures using PRF, which I think is the best method. I’m about two months into healing now and infections are gone. I would highly recommend Dr. Pechak if you need complex periodontal operations!<//review><Resp>None< /Resp><username>Mike He</username></record></dataset><record>

Overall - positive experience with the dentist.  However, you might want to let your referring dentists know that you have moved your location and update the forms they are handing out.  Also, when checking out, please make sure your support team has the correct patient dental insurance and not another patient's info.  OOPS!</Text>

I had an app with Dr Pechak. I sat waiting for one hour in the surgery room then decided to just walk out.  Staff kept coming with various excuses. "It will be 2 minutes"...then I waited another 30 min. Apparently the previous patient was having some (serious?) complications. The place feels run down and not clean, the surgery chair  I sat on was so old it had cracks in it.  After 40 min they realized they had to suddenly talk to my dentist although I had brought the referral letter with all the details. When I left no-one said anything other than "I guess we'll have to re-schedule", no apology even. On top of that the sign in form is very dubious with questions like "What is your partner's social security number?" or "What is the address of a relative that does not live with you?". I will look for another place with competent individuals.< /review>

Dr Pechak is an absolute master, skilled beyond belief, with decades of experience and the very latest techniques.  READ THIS + SEE PHOTOS IF YOU HAVE GUM RECESSION AND WILL GRAFT OR PINHOLE!! I would not hesitate, there is no-one better in U.S, forget Silicon Valley. I have just completed my 5mo x2 procedures for gum graft.  I consider offices that do not follow his state-of-the-art techniques to be living in the past.

He is by far one of the very best doctors I have ever experienced. I should start by saying I am very fussy and particular.  I have a moderate pain tolerance, I suffer from anxiety before a treatment and research well before I take the chance on any new doctor. I went to him with severe recession and I specifically wanted to have pinhole technique. I had already had traditional graft once before on one-side and was unhappy, having had an extremely difficult recovery. I pinned my hopes on him and he delivered what I wanted, but rightfully outlined that I needed the traditional grafting method on the top and was eligible for pinhole on the bottom. He made a plan to treat both sides of my mouth, in two stages, over 5 months apart.

I am now 5 days post my second surgery in writing and I could not be happier. He is straightforward, direct and honest. He photographs everything, walks you through and explains everything and puts you at ease.  It was important for me to write this after the second surgery so I could test the consistency and the recovery.

Unlike other doctors, he does not cut and stitch the palette (which is a nightmare). Instead, he makes a precise, very small incision on the side that the tissue is being grafted from in roof and then places a plastic mouth guard over the entire roof (made to measure) – not one suture in roof! This plastic guard sits there for 24 hours after surgery. You simply pop it off 24 hours later, and you are healed. To expedite this, they take blood and centrifuge it and add it to the wound during surgery. You will not believe how quickly you heal. After 24 hours, you can go about your business. Even drinking and eating=zero irritation. Anywhere else, lives in the past and is dated if they do not do it like this when the tech is available!!

The pinhole is equally amazing. He adds stitches to the pinhole surgery, so there is a small modification to the Chao technique – which I love! This is even easier than the traditional graft – just collagen filled in through a small hole. Very little pain or discomfort.  The sutures help to keep it in place and I have achieved results that are fantastic! If you qualify for this, have it done!! Dr Pechak will assess as needed.

I have the traditional graft + pinhole done in one session (having now had it done twice). Both times, the consistency of the surgery was amazing. I have healed beautifully, I was back to work after a couple of days of rest, and I had controlled swelling.  The instructions are clear and concise.

Finally, Dr Pechak and his entire staff care – deeply –  that you have good results, you heal, you feel happy and are comfortable. I consider them to be caregivers, not just a doctors office. Clarissa who deals with your insurance is unbelievable at her job – she is diligent, kind, caring, makes sure all your paperwork is in order and explains everything like a pro. She is fantastic and has been a rock for me through the process. Nidhi who runs the front desk is again so sweet, kind and attentive to your needs. When you arrive, they greet you so warmly – it  makes all the difference to have them hold your hand through this process! You realize that its not just about the doctor but their entire team. Nurses, equally fantastic and chat with you, talk you through everything and settle you in nicely.
I attach three photos for you to see:
1. Right - Shows the right side healing 5 days after surgery
2. Left - Shows left side after 5 months
3. Shows Left side 5 days after surgery
The ones after 5 days are early in healing, showing you how much coverage was achieved,  how it settles and heals 5 months down the line!<//Text>

<name>Jinggang Zhu</name><response>None</response><review>About 4~5 years ago, I had 3 loose molar teeth and regular gum bleeding problem. I couldn't eat well and had toothache very often.  Luckily, I met Dr. Pechak. He did laser operation on my gum which stopped the bleeding. Later, I got my first implant to my lower right molar from Dr. Pechak. It was an excellent job! I didn't feel much pain during the operation. The tooth worked the same as my original tooth without any problem during past 4 years! It helped me to build up high confidence on Dr. Pechak's professional expertise. So I received the 2nd and 3rd implants from him in past 3 years. All the implants are successful as expected. There is no issue to any of the implants so far. No extra maintenance work except regular tooth cleaning. Now I enjoy eating everyday! No more toothache!< /review>< user>

I've had two gum grafting surgeries with Dr Pechak. I have been very happy with the outcome and the recovery process, both were better and faster than when I went through the same surgery with another periodontist.< /Review>

<text>Doctor Pechak is extremely talented Dental Surgeon. Dr. Pechak and his staff are very courteous and very friendly.
He uses latest technology and an expert in teeth Implants and laser surgery of the gums.
Two weeks back, I had five implants for my teeth and the surgery went so well that I did not bleed just after the surgery and I was ready to go to work the next day. In less than 2 weeks, I am completely healed with no pain whatsoever.

I would highly recommend Dr. Pechak for Gum and Implant surgery. My friends who got their implant procedure somewhere else in the By Area, were in constant pain for up to 6 months and they had advised me not to go this procedure. I am very pleased that I found Dr. Pechak who is very capable of performing Impants and gum surgery without any post operative problems.</text><resp>None<//resp><Rate>5< /Rate>< GmapID>

Dr. Pechak is an awesome surgeon with great hands for the delicate work of gum grafting.  His use of PRGF was amazing for the healing process of my surgical sites.  My gum grafts looked great after 1 week!!!

Dr. Pechak is on the quiet side, but he is very professional/honest, and he is an excellent surgeon.  He has a very friendly and helpful staff.  I would not hesitate to recommend my family and friends to Dr. Pechak.</text>

I had a very pleasant experience with Dr. Pechak. He gave me all the details and answered my apprehensions before the procedure. Post-procedure he answered all my questions when I texted him even on a weekend. Dr. Pechak has soft hands and the entire procedure was not as painful as I had thought. His assistant Ms Manika was also very pleasant and had a knack of using the suction timely. The office staff is extremely friendly and they have a awesome tea/coffee bar!! Overall a pleasant experience and would strongly suggest Dr. Pechak and the LANAP procedure.<//Review>

You know how you always dream about a Star Trek advanced medical future? Well that future is here and it is happening at Dr. Pechak's office.  If you have ever had flap surgery, don't ever do it again. Instead get the LANAP treatment with Dr. Pechak.  I went to Dr. Pechak years ago for laser surgery, and now go to his center whenever I need periodontal work done.  I am in the middle of a tooth replacement, and really appreciate the work they do at Dr. Pechak's office.  Dr. Pechak and his top notch staff really care about your well being and comfort, and they are incredibly professional and effective.   I had gone to another periodontist for surgery, and ended up in tears after a barbaric flap procedure on just one quadrant.  Then I found out about Dr. Pechak's laser surgery, and they were able to do the same procedure without any suffering on my part, for all the rest of the three quadrants!  Dr. Pechak really listens to your needs and understands the level of empathy you require.  From my experience,  I highly recommend Dr. Pechak and his staff.< /review>

<user_name>Michael Schnadt< /user_name><date>1478912018239<//date><rating>5< /rating><review>Dr. Pechak and his team are fantastic - truly first class service with an exceptional outcome.  I initially came in for a second opinion after my original periodontist had proposed expensive and painful traditional periodontal flap surgery on all four quadrants.  Dr. Pechak's recommendation that I would be an ideal candidate for LANAP surgery almost sounded too good to be true, as the procedure had minimal recovery time and actually came in cheaper than the traditional surgical approach.  However, 6 months later and the procedure was a resounding success, reducing pockets depths that were up 2 7, 8 and even 9mm, to healthy 2-3mm pockets, with very healthy surrounding gum tissue.

Throughout the preparation, procedure, and post-surgical check-ins, Dr. Pechak and his team were careful to answer all my questions to set my concerns at ease, and were incredibly professional throughout.  I had been putting this procedure off for years because of fears and concerns about the post-operative discomfort, and Dr. Pechak's approach using LANAP couldn't have been easier or gone better.

I would confidently recommend him for your first (and probably only) opinion if you are looking for a dentist proficient in cutting edge, highly effective approaches to treating any serious periodontal issues you are dealing with.< /review>< pics>

<name>Bill Tynes< /name><text>I was referred to Dr. Pechak by my regular dentist after I was told by another specialist that I was not a candidate for an implant in a compromised gum area. Dr. Pechak performed a through periodontal exam and gave me a complete restoration plan including a remedy for the problem with my gums so I can get the implant needed in that area. I have a lot of issues that need to be addressed and it will take some time. I started the process about 5 weeks ago and I’m happy with my progress so far. Dr. Pechak has the latest technology and skills to expedite the plan. The office is a welcoming environment and the staff is friendly and efficient.

<Time>1611291278384<//Time><Review>Went to Dr. Pechack to check on a potential damaged/infected tooth.  He was able to save my tooth by performing a gum transferred (not sure of the exact medical terms.). Basically he's building/adding gum to the receding gum at the location of my tooth to eliminate deep pocket.  The procedure went really well due to his exceptional work.  Dr. Pechak is very professional and very very good.  I highly recommend him for anyone who has gum issues and potential loosing your teeth.  Don't just pull out for teeth, go see Dr, Pechak first!<//Review></record>

< review>
I have had many implants with Dr. Pechak they are all successful.
Other periodontists were less successful.
There was one implant that didn't take, probably because I did not take the
antibiotics long enough. But Dr. Pechak redid the implant without charge.
It took. I was quite impressed.

I have a new implant in progress. Yesterday he inserted the implant which required lifting of the sinuses and added new bone material. He explained the progress at each step, assuring me that the drill bit is flat-ended and that it will not damage the sinuses, a concern of mine. The surgery was successful and uneventful.  So far so very good.

Due to the pandemic, I chose not to continue the process - for about a year. Yesterday, I continued the process at his new location. It went without any hiccup. I was surprised at the number of people who worked there - for one periodontist. It was a short routine visit.</review>

I started seeing Dr. Pechak after he took over the location in Sunnyvale. During a routine check he found a previously undiscovered hidden infection and treated it immediately, and I'm very happy with the result. He is very knowledgeable and friendly, and I would highly recommend him.
The office staff is also very professional and friendly.</Review>

I was Dr. Pechak’s patient 9-10 yrs ago. I remembered I had painless and uneventful gum procedures then.

Last year my x-ray showed I had a little bone loss to one of my teeth. I put off seeing a specialist because there was no discomfort (a big mistake). Earlier this month, I learnt the tooth can no longer be saved. I emailed Dr. Pechak’s office to get his opinion and have recent x-ray emailed to him. I also told his staff I am unable to make too many trips to his office as my work is quite far. They scheduled me a few days later.

I went in and Dr. Pechak thoroughly explained my situation. I went with his opinion because he is very professional and had gained my trust. Consultation and procedure took about 1.5 hours. I drove home immediately after, the procedure was painless, no post-surgery bleeding, and the recovery went smoothly. This is all due to Dr. Pechak’s exceptional work! His staff called the next day to check how I was feeling. Very thoughtful. I requested a two week follow up instead of normal one week. They have been very accommodating to all my needs.  Waiting for the bone graft to heal and will be back for the next process in a few months.

Dr. Pechak is a very gentle, knowledgeable, highly skilled, and most trusted periodontist/surgeon.
His use of PGRF seems to make the surgical site heal faster. He is an exceptional dentist who never shy away from using the latest technology for the benefit of his patients. I really appreciate his work.

Dr. Pechak and his staff are very professional, courteous, warm, and friendly.

I would go back to Dr. Pechak if I have another need for his service.</text>

My dentist referred me to Dr. Pechak because of his specialty in handling implants for front teeth, which are more complex than implants for molars.  Dr. Pechak and his team are exceptionally professional in both methods and manners, and they take the time you need to explain procedures, answer questions, and address concerns.  I even got personal follow-up calls from the team to make sure recovery is going well!  I highly recommend Dr. Pechak's work.<//Review>

Dr Peshak is clearly very knowledgable and cutting edge in his treatment.  He has " good hands" and a good bedside manner.  My only wish was to have had a little more time during the consultation to talk about the technique.< /text>

<Text>Recently I unfortunately cracked a tooth when biting down on a piece of olive bread that contained an olive pit. When this happened I didn’t know the tooth had been damaged because it was a root canal tooth. Upon my next dental cleaning I was informed that I would need the tooth to be extracted and likely bone grafting because I already had lost bone in my jaw. My regular dentist wanted me to have this taken care of quickly. This is when I went to the Perio & Implant Center and met Dr. Bembey. This is a very nice office that is extremely well-equipped with the latest equipment from what I can gather. All of the staff are very professional and friendly, which helps a lot when the dentist chair is one of your least favorite places on Earth to be :-). Dr. Bembey is a very caring practitioner with a great chair side manner. She is trained in advanced techniques that speed healing. She extracted my tooth and performed the bone graft skillfully and with minimal pain afterwards. I didn’t experience much, if any swelling. Dr. Bembey made herself available by cell phone afterwards which was appreciated when I had a problem tolerating the antibiotics. The entire implant process will take months given the need for my bone graft to heal first. I’ve been back to the office a couple times and was treated to some laser biostimulation to help nerves heal from a totally different dental procedure that was done by my general dentist after my tooth was extracted. My regular dentist had to work on a molar to put a crown on it and the numbing from that procedure hadn’t worn off after almost a couple weeks, indicating some nerve damage or irritation from the Novocain shots my general dentist gave me. Dr. Bembey simply wanted me to heal fast and gave me two laser biostimulation sessions already. It has certainly helped and makes me think very highly of both Dr. Bembey and this office. They went above and beyond the call of duty for me.  I highly recommend this office and Dr. Bembey if you need an implant and/or periodontal treatments.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< Review>
About 4~5 years ago, I had 3 loose molar teeth and regular gum bleeding problem. I couldn't eat well and had toothache very often.  Luckily, I met Dr. Pechak. He did laser operation on my gum which stopped the bleeding. Later, I got my first implant to my lower right molar from Dr. Pechak. It was an excellent job! I didn't feel much pain during the operation. The tooth worked the same as my original tooth without any problem during past 4 years! It helped me to build up high confidence on Dr. Pechak's professional expertise. So I received the 2nd and 3rd implants from him in past 3 years. All the implants are successful as expected. There is no issue to any of the implants so far. No extra maintenance work except regular tooth cleaning. Now I enjoy eating everyday! No more toothache!<//Review>

Dr. Pechak was knowledgable about what kind of surgery would best benefit my receding gum situation, recommending a gum graft procedure over the pinhole surgery.  Surgery proceeded efficiently.  Initially, recovery was uncomfortable, but because of the PRGF technique he uses, where a patient's own plasma is used to help healing, my recovery time was faster than I expected, based on friends' experiences with other periodontists.  They had told me to expect months of recovery, but after two weeks, I was almost completely back to normal.  I'm thankful for good results, and eating normally again!  His staff were all helpful and friendly, responsive to questions.< /text>

Therefore, whether you need is implants to replace missing teeth or you have a gum problem. Dr. Pechak will help you to improve your smile and bring your teeth back to healthy one. I would recommend him to everyone.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

He uses latest technology and an expert in teeth Implants and laser surgery of the gums.
Two weeks back, I had five implants for my teeth and the surgery went so well that I did not bleed just after the surgery and I was ready to go to work the next day. In less than 2 weeks, I am completely healed with no pain whatsoever.

I would highly recommend Dr. Pechak for Gum and Implant surgery. My friends who got their implant procedure somewhere else in the By Area, were in constant pain for up to 6 months and they had advised me not to go this procedure. I am very pleased that I found Dr. Pechak who is very capable of performing Impants and gum surgery without any post operative problems.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>You know how you always dream about a Star Trek advanced medical future? Well that future is here and it is happening at Dr. Pechak's office.  If you have ever had flap surgery, don't ever do it again. Instead get the LANAP treatment with Dr. Pechak.  I went to Dr. Pechak years ago for laser surgery, and now go to his center whenever I need periodontal work done.  I am in the middle of a tooth replacement, and really appreciate the work they do at Dr. Pechak's office.  Dr. Pechak and his top notch staff really care about your well being and comfort, and they are incredibly professional and effective.   I had gone to another periodontist for surgery, and ended up in tears after a barbaric flap procedure on just one quadrant.  Then I found out about Dr. Pechak's laser surgery, and they were able to do the same procedure without any suffering on my part, for all the rest of the three quadrants!  Dr. Pechak really listens to your needs and understands the level of empathy you require.  From my experience,  I highly recommend Dr. Pechak and his staff.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Dr. Pechak and his team are fantastic - truly first class service with an exceptional outcome.  I initially came in for a second opinion after my original periodontist had proposed expensive and painful traditional periodontal flap surgery on all four quadrants.  Dr. Pechak's recommendation that I would be an ideal candidate for LANAP surgery almost sounded too good to be true, as the procedure had minimal recovery time and actually came in cheaper than the traditional surgical approach.  However, 6 months later and the procedure was a resounding success, reducing pockets depths that were up 2 7, 8 and even 9mm, to healthy 2-3mm pockets, with very healthy surrounding gum tissue.

Throughout the preparation, procedure, and post-surgical check-ins, Dr. Pechak and his team were careful to answer all my questions to set my concerns at ease, and were incredibly professional throughout.  I had been putting this procedure off for years because of fears and concerns about the post-operative discomfort, and Dr. Pechak's approach using LANAP couldn't have been easier or gone better.

I would confidently recommend him for your first (and probably only) opinion if you are looking for a dentist proficient in cutting edge, highly effective approaches to treating any serious periodontal issues you are dealing with.< /Text>

<Review>No one likes hearing that they need to have a tooth removed, and replaced with an implant. But, if you have to hear that you want to be sitting in the exam chair at Doctor Pechak office.  There is no one better in the Bay Area.

My molar had a cracked root and had to come out. It was extracted under local anesthetic in under an hour. Dr. Pechak uses state of the art equipment and advanced techniques to assure great results.

For example, Dr. Pechak uses your own healing factors from a small amount of blood he draws before the procedure. In blood plasma are palettes and other good things that make us heal. By mixing those with tiny pieces of bone and inserting that in the hole where the tooth used to be healing occurs quicker and with less chance of complications.

The proof is, I left the office with a regime of antibiotics and Motrin. I never needed more that. I had no post-surgery bleeding or pain. By the second day I was eating everything I normally do, I just had to chew on the other side of my mouth.

Dr Pechak is a perfectionist. That isn’t a good trait for a Barista making your daily latte, but it’s great when it comes to having your teeth and mouth work properly and stay healthy. There isn’t anybody I would trust more than Dr. Pechak to do that for me.

Face it, oral surgery is a big inconvenience and very costly, and in the Bay Area there are few bargains. Since you already know that you might as well choose someone who is going do the procedure in the most effective and painless way and produce great results.

My Mom used to say: be true to your teeth or they will be false to you, and my Dad used to say: pay for the best and cry only once.< /Review>< pics>

<review>for more than fifteen years (and this means: since i was about fifty), i have been dr peschak's client, and my experience has been overwhelmingly -- and undramatically -- positive. "overwhelmingly positive" because dr peschak's professional competence, combined with an awareness of the most recent technological possibilities, have given me the assuring certainty to be, quite literally, in the best possible odontological hands. "undramatically positive" because dr. peschak is a master in the art of age-adequate anticipation. his well-timed interventions have helped me avoid anything near an "emergency situation." rather, his care has given me the present of feeling "odentologically young" at age sixty-eight.< /review>< userid>

My husband and I have been wanting to try this place since it opened and we finally went last night!  This will definitely be one of our go to places from now on.  We had the loaded nachos (a generous sized plate of nachos),  + shrimp and steak tacos.  Everything was awesome. The service was excellent, too.  Oh and the margarita was perfect.  A+ for food, drinks and service.</Review>

Food was delicious. I highly recommend the taquitos, great item to share, and they come with a hearty serving of guac. Their chips and salsa were also super yummy. The service was also spectacular. Veronica helped us out and she was super sweet, checked in on often, gave us great recommendations, and made sure to tell us about the specials and happy hour menu. She provided excellent customer service; I wish more servers/waiters were like her.<//text>

My girl really enjoyed the mango margarita. I had the cucumber one they were a little sweet for me but she loved hers. $12 ea. The tacos we're okay ,not bad. I didn't like the al pastor at all that was not tender or flavorful. The mole  taco was really good I had to order another. We had to sit outside because of the current situation and we froze the whole time. There isn't enough heaters out there so won't be coming back at night. They had a Dj bumping some music which was cool and the bar is really nice. They also had some $5 tequila shots going on too. I thought the service was really bad though, they had a lot of servers standing around talking to each other we lost our service for over 30 mins at one point waiting to order more drinks and food and no there servers wanted to help us out. The food just isn't that amazing to deal with that or the prices for me personally.< /Review>

We were waiting for so long to get our drinks, at least 1 hour🙄 and the worst part comes when we get the bill, it was like if we went to a gourmet restaurant!!!
Now I'd rather go to outback to get a nice dinner and better service than come back here!<//text>< Name>

I am giving it 3 starts because the food was good. But the drinks could not been more terrible. The horchata tasted like sour gone bad milk with lemonade. And the melon juice tasted like a gone bad orange Gatorade. We were afraid to drink them.</Review>

I placed an order 12/20 on postmates under the name Heber and they confirmed the order but then cancelled it like half an hour after. The number on their website seems disconected and its hard to find other contact info and I still have not recieved so much as a text message telling me why Angelica decided to cancel my order. Maybe this issue can be resolved soon, I hope.<//text>

<text>This place is new so I might try them again in a few months and update the review.

Service took forever. We asked a question on the menu while ordering and our waiter didnt come back for 15 minutes and forgot we had a question and thought we ordered. So we had to wait for him to go ask again.

Their menu is very limited IMO. Beside appetizers its just 2 burritos and a few tacos.<//text><date>1600839529953<//date>< rate>

Nurse practitioner Sunny Bush has been an incredible support system on my medication journey. Working with her and her office has always been safe, positive, and efficient. They are thorough and attentive and Sunny is undeniably the kindest and most helpful pill doctor I ever could have imagined. I found this office through an insurance referral and couldn’t be more grateful.< /review>

Dr. K really takes care of my husband.  We know he is very busy and appreciate that he spends so much time reviewing all of Dan’s questions and concerns.

We recently started working with Jessica, one of the specialists.  She’s very thorough and we appreciate the time she’s spending on Dan’s case.</review>

I met with Jessica Schmidt. It was my first time ever meeting with a psychiatrist. She was so kind, thorough, and truly helpful. It was nice to meet with someone who has a different knowledge on trauma and mental health issues.< /text>

<Review>This is difficult to share as it’s personal, but I am so very grateful for all the help, guidance and support I received from Marina at Siyan.   She was firm, but kind and held me accountable to do my part. Together we transformed my situation which was desperately needed.   I feel much more hopeful and optimistic now.  She is professional and highly experienced, and uses a tough love approach which for me was needed.  I feel so fortunate to have found her and Siyan.   I strongly recommend this place. We all need a little help and support about now.  Thank you Siyan!!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>I have seen a psychiatrist at this location and am currently undergoing TMS treatment. The gals that run this program are soooo kind and wonderful! I actually look forward to it! The front desk gals are also really nice :)

I thought I could leave another review but I cant so I am just going to add to my original one.
It is such a hard journey seeking help with mental health issues. My journey has been long and hard, but this clinic has not given up on me. Every single person has shown me kindness, even when calling the front desk their voices are cheery. This helps me keep going on this journey of healing. I am so grateful for their patience, knowledge, and care.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1618079571172, 'text': 'Thank you, Sarah, for the positive feedback about Siyan Clinical.

Getting help from the Clinic several years ago literally changed my life..saved it is an appropriate adjective too.  Dr. Shah evaluation, the CBT class he recommended and my years of counseling with Dr. Jeannie have been beyond amazing in the help and tools they have given me.  Barbara Farrell has been so efficient in checking with me about my medications.
And your front desk staff are so helpful, patient and pleasant.
Siyan Clinic deserves more than 5 stars.</review>< name>

I was going through an incredibly difficult time and every where I called - no one could help me - either because they were not taking more patients or only couples or a variety of other reasons.

Siyan called me back the same day and their kindness helped me to know there was hope for me to get help.

Since there Marina has been there for me and helped me try to get back on my feet.</review>

I’ve been a patient at this clinic for years and they never cease to amaze me. I also work in healthcare with an expertise in patient experience and can say that Siyan clinic is consistently exceptional and Dr. K is amazing. I’ve experienced a lot of hardship in the last several years including the 2017 fires call and am thankful for Dr. K helping me through these times. Thank you to everyone at Siyan Clinic.<//text>

A positive report on Dr. Desai.
Dear Siyan, Dr. Desai was nice and welcoming to me and she is smart. She took care of me and was always careful to make sure my medications didn’t interact with each other in a bad way. She was nice to allow my mom to come to my appointments and was in charge of the dosages of my medications. Dr. Desai also took my input seriously. She was not too serious and she is relatable through her more basic psychology training vs her doctoral medication education. Also, I want to say that I ran into Dr. Desai and her very young son at my work at Trader Joe’s and it was obvious that she is nice towards her patients in public and not too short, and she also respected my confidentiality. Thank you, Dr. Desai. My mom and I wish you the best.

I am incredibly proud to be apart such a passionate team. Siyan has grown to be more than just a providers office but focused on the patient experience, continues to expand services, and more involved in the community everyday. I was NOT asked to write this review. I just want to speak my honest opinion and reflect on my perception, internally. Our providers  and Admin are extremely genuine, even internally they are kind and professional. As one of the project coordinators, I can gladly say I am directly involved and always listening to our patients, improving, expanding and making our patients experience as comfortable as it can be.< /Review>

Dr Shah is an incredible person for having found this place. Siyan Staff and Project Hope are amazing! They are truly dedicated to helping people, and making sure you feel at home. They are kind and understanding, and have bent over backwards to accommodate me. I have also been seeing them going on three years!  As an addict I can say these people have saved my life and taught me skills that I can use day to day. Thank you Tiffany, Tomas, and Ronie for all that you do, I  wouldn't be here without you ❤️ Also thank you front desk ladies! You are organized, professional, and most of all very kind, patient, and understanding 👍❤️ I also love how staff decorates for holidays!!!</text>

I have worked with several of the clinicians at Siyan.  My experience with Terri Drew has been very positive.  She is welcoming and knowledgeable.
Terri advised me on medication issues and supported me during life's more challenging times.   I would recommended her without hesitation.</review>

<username>Chris R</username><time>1568014007790<//time><rate>5<//rate><text>Dr. Terry Drew is a god send and 5 stars simply doesn't do justice to simply how amazing she truly is! What do I mean? I could rattle on about my 3 visits but there isn't enough room on this review to rant and rave about their level of patient to doctor level of comfort they provide (and let's be honest- no one want to read more than 3 sentences which I have already passed). I will say this however; if you want a real person who doesn't BS and talks and treats the patient like a real person without games or nonsense, Dr. Drew is the Doctor for you! Again, 5 stars aren't enough, this professional level of service from a professional provider deserves 6 star at least!!< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I have had the pleasure of working with the team at Siyan Clinical Research on their medication assisted treatment program called Project Hope.

The team at Siyan Clinical go above and beyond to understand each patient's individual psychiatric needs and provides them with an effective treatment plan in a supportive, compassionate environment.

They deserve more than five stars for their services. While I hope you or a loved one never need their assistance, if you do, Siyan Clinical Research should be your first choice.<//Text>

From my collaborating MDs and the entire team, the collegiality made it fun to go to work with a sense of purpose and enjoyment. In a field treating persons with suffering or life challenges, the importance of a positive uplifting environment and team really matter.  The support and technology for seeing patients and charting was streamlined. The mission and service to the community was always growing and progressive. The respect from the collaborating MDs and team and everyone’s interest in learning as well made for a dynamic milieu.  I furthermore fully realized upon leaving Siyan that the benefit package was highly competitive and with profit sharing added nicely to my retirement funding. For anyone wondering about a career with Siyan Clinical, I highly recommend a positive working experience and relationship with the team as well as the clientele. Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of Siyan Clinical.  Terri Drew</Text></record></dataset><record>

I have found Siyan Clinical and in particular, Terri Drew, NP,  to be extremely competent and friendly. The office space is inviting and comfortable and all my appointments have been on-time and efficient. I have no hesitation in giving them my highest recommendation.< /Review>

I've been coming here since April 2018. I go for mental health services, medication management, and Suboxone maintenance. Everyone here has been kind, understanding, and has treated me fairly.  As far as the maintenance program goes, I've followed their guidelines to the best of my ability with an understanding that if I don't, then I cannot be a part of that program. I've been doing great with their help!< /text>

Thank you to entire Siyan staff in Santa Rosa. I encourage anyone struggling to make your way there, you will find relief.<//text><gmapID>0x8084381253a5433f:0x191aa92c2587aa0e</gmapID>< Response>

So I have a team of three amazing people here at siyan (project hope) Kari is an exceptional case manager who is dedicated determined and compassionate. She goes above and beyond helping with everything from anxiety to the more practical things like scheduling much needed medical appointments. Ever since coming to siyan clinical my life has made a huge turn around. Amanda the project coordinator is provides excellent help as well and is always very welcoming. Tiffany the nurse practitioner is thorough, kind, and never judgmental. I always feel safe here and it’s a great place to go for healing. Project hope saved my life. Huge thanks to siyan clinical and the team.< /Review>

<Review>DO NOT COME HERE. Rudest up front staff ever. There was only one good girl but she left. The other two are the worst! They never smile, they are rude to patients and they will talk about patients right in front of you or even while your in the waiting room. Word of advice is never come here. There’s plenty of other amazing facilities. This one is the worst. Frankly because of the front staff.< /Review>< Response>

I am a drug addict in recovery now thanks to the faculty, Dr. Shah, and Kari at Siyan Clinical. I used to smoke meth, heroin, etc. Now I'm taking suboxone along with therapy. I've been sober for 5 months now. Highly recommended anyone who needs help come try this place out.<//text>

<review>Unfriendly, cold and rude. Never smiling. Isn’t this supposed to be a place for mental health services? If the patient walks out feeling worse than when they walked in, I fail to see how this group is helpful. I dreaded every single visit. Thank God Jesse fired me today. I probably should have done it myself sooner. I don’t think I am overreacting, but in a little kindness would have gone a long way. If all you want is medically assisted treatment, just go in there like a robot and you’ll be fine. If you’re looking for kindness and warmth and support, find another place.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
I have been seeing Teri Drew for over a year now, I have been treated with respect from the first day from both the staff and clinicians. I was initially asked by my doctor to come here for psychiatric meds as it is very tough for a medical doctor to prescribe these now that the opiod epidemic has started :( I sort of came begrudgingly, but since my health insurance was willing to foot the cost (except for a $40 copay) I decided I would go and make things easier for my doctor. I am so happy I made the decision to come in, not only have I experienced great advise and counseling, Teri has really helped me (partnered with me) to make the best decisions I can make regarding medication and life decisions, she is very knowledgeable with meds, side effects and what works with what. I can honestly state that this is the best I have felt (I am 55), my depression is non-existent, my anxieties are manageable now and my sleep cycles are returning. Teri was not forceful with her advise which helped me excel, I think she knows when you need a little push and will give that if needed, but mostly I feel this is a partnership allowing me to feel the best I can about my life! I want to state again, I have had nothing but positive attitudes from everyone I have met at Siyan and appreciate everyone from the front desk staff, to my doctor, to the doctor that filled in for her and helped me with my meds while she was away on vacation...I would definitely suggest this business to anyone that has the need! :)
I have met now with one of the other clinicians and she is terrific as well! They are doing tele visits now and that is very helpful during Covid, though their office is immaculate and they have loads of Covid protections in place.
I am also now meeting with Carrie and she is also wonderful and has many good ideas on how to curb anger and depression. I will continue to work with her on these items and many more. The staff at Siyan are all wonderful, very wonderful and helpful!< /Review>

<review>I have been coming to Siyan for a long time now. For mental health reasons -severe depression. I come here five days a week for TMS treatment. The staff here go out of their way to make sure you are taken care of and they joke with you as well. It pained me to see the last review from the Angelica person. Because I am pretty sure she is a past disgruntled employee. She speaks ill of Andy and Rhonda. The two front desk people that have been there for a long time. Both of them know my name and call me by name when I come in  and treat me like family. The so called one good girl that used to work there? She couldn't get off of her phone to look up and greet me when I walked in. I stood there in front of her for several minutes one time and she finally looked up from texting and said "man problems right?"  I do not know what she was talking about nor do I want to. Not a fan. This place is very professional in how they treat you. I love Jullianna, Katrina, and Laurie as well. The billing people Briana and Helen are also great at explaining your bills and how your insurance works. I have seen the front office staff have some upset patients come in and they handle them with kindness and politeness. If you have a mental health need then this is a great office to come to get help. The staff and doctors go out of their way to be kind to you.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>This is the most least helpful place- I have the most absolute worst experience ever trying to even understand what their rules, protocols, etc were but the office people who state they don't make the decisions actually wasted over an hour an a half of my time with gathering and calling back and based on almost no information whatsoever stated they couldn't help the person- based on next to no information. On top of it, the worst of it, I am a Executive professional, I deal with people all day, some difficult and have never felt so demeaned by anyone. It was very "beat around the bush" evasive answers that were to not state assumptions clearly made about how a number of people were not good enough for their services; after being told that an appointment could be made suddenly it could not be. When someone needs help with this type of treatment, a little kindness, 'bedside manner', some level of respect that the person is a human being is IMPORTANT. I get not wanting to say the straightforward, honest thing because you're afraid someone could take it as judgement but that would've been far better that what I experienced. This was the most least professional, disrespectful exchange I can recall having since I worked in hotels 15 years ago. In an attempt to try to help others I ended up losing important hours of my day and ended up feeling like I now need a therapist. I had recommended this entity before I HIGHLY recommend against it now.  I feel they might actually make you worse off then when you came in- or tied to...</Review>< Name>

My wife and I both got a haircut by Chris and Linda. Needless to say, we were anxious to get our haircut done during COVID, but this place is extremely clean, and Chris and Linda were very friendly and accommodating. We love our haircuts, received so many compliments, and will definitely be returning to Happy Cuts again.< /review>

I have been coming here for about 7-8 years now. My favorite thing is I walk out with the same great haircut every time. They have 4 employees that all give great hair cuts. I used to latch on to a person when I found someone who could skillfully navigate my dome but in this place I'm comfortable walking in and waiting for whoever is next. It's so convenient to walk in. I'm usually in and out in less than 25 minutes. 6 stars!< /review>

I'm 30 and I've been seeing Kim for about 4 years. My husband and MIL saw her as well. She's fantastic, I've never been disappointed! They have the best price around for high quality work. They've recently moved to a new location, but it only adds a 3 or 4 more minutes to the drive. Completely worth it! I wouldn't go to anyone else. Highly recommend for men's and women's cuts!</Text>

<review>I've been a Happy Cuts customer since 2014, ever since I moved from Pennsylvania. I've tried a few other salons in the area, but never seemed to get a haircut I wanted. At Happy Cuts, however, my hairdresser Kim is always able to cut my hair exactly as I want, and every time I leave satisfied, smiling, and grateful to her. The prices for haircuts are pretty afordable, and everyone who works there is friendly and polite.< /review>< Resp>

<Text>I went in here after reading all the good reviews, had high hopes. I go in around 1:30PM on a Monday, I see that there are only 2 stylists who already had customers, but luckily nobody else waiting so I go in, tell them I want a haircut and they tell me to have a seat. No problem. 20 minutes go by and a gentleman walks in, doesn't have an appointment either and he asks how long he has to wait. They tell him 15 minutes. I'm thinking, "Oh good it must be my turn soon then". One of the ladies finishes up, and asks me to wait for 15 more minutes and takes the gentleman after me first. Now i'm a little annoyed. Another 20 minutes go by, and the lady who took the gentleman finishes him up, cleans up, and i'm thinking "okay surely they'll take me now?". Then she just starts chatting up the other stylist while i'm there. Still. Waiting. I wait around another 5-10 minutes, they don't acknowledge me so I just walk out. Now I understand that they recommend taking appointments, and I have no problem waiting. But if they're aware that i've been waiting, takes the person who comes in after me FIRST, then that's when I have a problem. Will not be coming back here.< /Text>< Pictures>

They all give awesome haircuts, especially Chris. I convince my wife to start going there for her hair highlights and haircut. Much more reasonable than the fancy fancy places but just as high-quality.</Text>

Awesome find in Cupertino! I got a trim and layers for just $25, plus I was struggling to find a salon that I really liked for a hair cut. Kim did a great job; I sure am sticking with this place. I don't need a fancy shampoo. Easy to get an appointment on a weekend (avoid weekends, the place is too packed.) They do kiddie cuts too.< /review>

Course is primarily flat but plenty of holes with water and bunkers to make it challenging.  Nice views and  staff. Breakfast at the clubhouse is really good.  The snack bar makes great sandwiches too!< /review>

<Text>Beautiful facilities, beautiful golf course... Have been to a few weddings here and they have been amazing! Go down to the golf shop... It's really nice and the man behind the counter isn't too bad on the eyes either and he's very friendly and informative and always good for a laugh...

<Text>Such a beautiful well groomed golf course! The members of this club are some of the sweetest people you will have ever had the pleasure to meet. There is a great snackbar downstairs that you can grab a bite to eat and get good cocktails too! Plenty of parking is available if you book an event with the club... One of the best clubs around!< /Text>< Date>

It has the best cherries in Walnut Blvd. Cheap price, sweet cherries. The place is big. Parking place is large, and you don't need to park in the street.< /Text>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>So many cherries! The trees were very accessible and ladders are provided for reaching the higher places. The rules they have you read before you go in are easy to follow. I would definitely come here again. I went last week and the cherries were extremely ripe and sweet. The season will be ending soon.

I put 4 stars instead of 5 because the person at the entrance wasn't welcoming.< /Text>< pics>

<text>Nice people, cherries easy to pick. Grown organically.  Different varieties , so different ripening times means you can go more than once during the season. Lots of parking.</text>< pics>

<Review>Always amazing at Bloomfield! Love that they allow wagons. We were able to cart the children as well as our bucket of cherries with ease. Staff is always super nice and helpful. We jet straight for the trees far out. There's ladders and less people if you walk all the way out. Toilets tend to get a bit muddy due to the wash station. One of our favs!</Review><userid>100874090599933689845</userid><user_name>N'Dozie Matingou< /user_name></record>

Great farm with lots of cherry trees (25 acres to be precise). Trees are looking healthy and there are lots of cherries on it.
But the demand is huge so it is better to visit farm as soon as picking season is started.< /review>

Worst farm ever. Very rude staff and a very disgusting farm. 80 percent of the cherries are rotten and an even greater percent of people. Verbally abused a kid and started using several cuss words. Spoiled the mood of the whole group. For the adults, used F-word and threatened to call the cops. The very ill-mannered staff ruined my perfect day. I highly recommend not to go to this nasty farm!<//review>

We picked up a lot of cherries. You can eat as much as you want, and pay for for what you picked in a bucket that is provided by the farmers. We paid $3.5 per pound this time. Bring a lot of cash. A whole bucket is about 30 pounds and costs about $100. Parking is free.< /Review>

< Review>
I don't want to give even a single star for this farm but unfortunately i cannot give a lesser star than one for posting this review.

We have visited many farms till date but this farm staff is the rudest and meanest people we have ever seen.

My 8 year old daughter near the billing counter, took out one of the bad cherry from her collection bucket and threw it..the staff screamed at her that she cannot throw it even if it is bad. She got very scared and crying for a long time. They could have handled this more politely... there was no need to scream at her so loudly and embarass the little one and family in front of so many people.

There are so many farms with polite staff..avoid these hooligans.</Review>

<text>What an experience - picking cherries at its peak! The cherries r so good, and some of them are low - perfect for young kids. We enjoyed a lot at a sunny afternoon. Be sure sun protect your little ones. They do charge $2 entrance fee, but still very reasonable price - cheaper than local farms market.<//text>< userid>

As with all Cherry farms, it ain't cheap but it's fresh!  We came here around 0930 hours and the place was pretty packed. No entrance fee and staff will give you instructions not to pull the leaves.

You do pay a premium but the cherries are good. We easily spent $60 here and finished it all in under two days!<//review>

Unfortunately, we have no way to project our customer turn out and being that the crop this year is state wide light, it’s just a matter of protecting the fruit that isn’t ready for the next opening day.  Let me know what we can do to get your business back.  We will be posting days the the weekend in a day or two.  We have a large crop of the next two varietals of cherries to come to ripen.  Feel feee to call me to set up a time to meet or talk.  Again, so sorry for your disappointment .  925-783-0050'}</response>

Arrived at my designated pick up time.  Oscar helped me out and he is so patient and awesome.  He helped me out with my online order,  a quick return package and 3 additional items to exchange since I did not have a receipt.

Dennis uniforms has you covered. From the minute you walk in they have files you can choose from that have all the school requirements and cover all Catholic schools in the LA area. The space is huge and they have sections for boys and girls. They have long sleeve, short sleeve, pants, shorts, skirts, jackets and sweaters, plus all the accessories. They will even patch on your schools emblem to any shirt or jacket, for an added cost. Lots of dressing rooms and there is even a restroom inside for bathroom breaks. Stay are friendly and very helpful, especially if this is your first time. Parking lot is easy to get in and out of with plenty of parking.</Text>< Date>

I love Dennis. The skirts don't wrinkle and hold up wash after wash. Dennis is so good that now that my daughter is grown,, she still wants Dennis uniform plaid skirts to wear to work.4 stars is because to find various plaids you have to go to each individual school. It would be nice to have a way just to shop.</Text>

The place is very nice and clean but very expensive. The uniforms cost as much as designer clothing and we cant buy it anywhere else. Which the store knows.< /Text>

<Text>We’ve been shopping here for a good 15 years never had an issue whatever they run out of we get it shipped .. due to COVID 19 we had to order stuff online for my daughter which for some reason sizing didn’t work out , long story short the customer service (800) number couldn’t and didn’t even know how to help me regarding exchange it was a nightmare for 2 weeks at the end the supervisor just hanged up on my face :) so I call the store and Oscar answers !! Guess what within 2 hours our order was shipped !! Yep just like that ! I was beyond relieved and very thankful to the store ! Great customer service and definitely has answers to all my questions< /Text>< pictures>

I originally called for an order inquiry and Armando took all my information promptly and explained to me the next steps and that I will receive a returned phone call. Following, Oscar contacted me who went above and beyond to help me with all my questions. He not only answered them he assured that I received my daughters uniform pants on time. This is truly what customer service is about. Thank you for world-class service!

I had a great experience at Dennis Uniform - Los Angeles! As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by Linda, who helped me get everything I needed, from start to finish. She was very helpful. There were a couple of items that I needed that they didn't have in stock, but I love having the option for them to ship those items to me for free! The shop was organized and everything was easy to find. All of the employees that I interacted with were very personable and helpful. My only critique was that in the files that held lists for all of the school's, my son's school did not have a list. This was extremely minor to me, as Linda knew what I needed! I'm so excited for my son to look sharp in TK next year. Thank you, Linda and Dennis Uniform!<//text>

Dennis Uniform is by far the best uniform store in the Los Angeles area. From the minute we walked in, we were greeted with great smiles and even better customer service. The store is clean and very organized. Every school had their section. Mirza (store clerk) was great in helping me pick out all of the required uniforms for my daughter and even suggesting the right sizes for her. She didn't hover around us. She just allowed us to take our time choosing our clothes and accessories. When I told her that I would have to wait a week to order the uniform online to get the school's discount, she spoke to Oscar and honored my discount on the spot. Everything but 2 skirts were available. She ordered them for me and I will get them delivered for free to my home in less than a week. Overall, best customer service in town!</review>

Great Customer Service!! Jorelle helped me out to locate all of my daughters items needed for school. Jorelle was patient and supper helpful. I commend the management team at the Dennis Uniform Store in Los Angeles. You run “a tight ship” which is clearly evident. You get parents in and out and I truly appreciate it. The customer service at the store is really impressive. Please keep up the good work!</text>

Have been ordering for 3 years now and have never had an issue. Until, recently I was sent the wrong size shorts ... but it wasn't an issue at all. All I had to do was call in and they sent the correct size right away. The only inconvenience is that I have to find time in my  busy schedule to return the wrong item.  But, things happen, right.  Very well run business. I love the deals they throw out throughout the year. About every 3-4 months there is some deal - even if its just free shipping - it helps!< /text>

The young people that work there are very friendly and helpful. The store run out of big sizes pretty fast. Also, the uniforms for the school that we were looking for are all over the place; it will be helpful to have everything in one section. Prices are a little high just for a school logo because that is what we ate paying for.<//Text>

All I’m going to say is that these uniforms are WAY too pricey ... and the shorts/pants are such tough material which I’m sure is for longevity and wear but makes them uncomfortable for little ones . Aside from the uniforms being as pricey as they are.. you shave to pay shipping on top of that .. which gets more expensive as well the more you buy . I went and bought shorts and pants for my son from Old Navy instead</review>

{'time': 1523040140051, 'text': 'Dear Ms. Garcia,\n\nThank you for your feedback! Which school are you shopping for at DENNIS Uniform? I want to take a look at the specific t-shirt to get more information for you. I am happy to hear that you are pleased with our stock availability, but I want to make sure that I give you the correct information on the lack of stain resistance. Traditionally it is due to keeping chemicals off of children’s clothing. Please reach out directly to ejb@dennisuniform.com with further information and we will look into this for you. Thank you again for your business and your review. Have a great weekend! Elizabeth B.'}<//response>

< Review>
I went in to get my child's uniforms for school, but they didn't have his size. Normally, they have extra shirts without the logo so you can get the color you need and they'll put the logo on for you, but they didn't even have those in his size either. I asked the lady when they would get a shipment in and she just smiled and said that I shouldn't rely on that because first they fill the online orders then whatever's left over goes to the store. I am disappointed that a store where we are forced to buy from doesn't stock up properly when they know that the crowds are going to build before school starts. Most of the schools tend to use the same colors, so why not stock up like they should? Why don't they prepare? If I didn't have to buy from this place I definitely wouldn't. The prices are way too expensive to be dealing with this b.s.</Review>

< review>
The best chiropractor I’ve ever been to. Coming from a different location, and I feel much more taken care of here. And the biggest difference is I don’t feel rushed and all areas of concern are addressed and adjusted very gently each and every time. They did not rush the alignment of the rest of the spine that’s compensating. I feel at different offices you’ll be rushed out in under a minute and you look in the waiting room and hear crickets. And you wonder what was the big rush? I never felt like that here and after multiple visits I actually felt like there was more attention put on my weak points. I’ve been here past closing and they still opened doors for customers well past closing, dedicating their time and empathizing with their patients.

I’ve been getting alignments for around 8 years for sciatica and just had a herniated bulge and disc and couldn’t walk or feel my leg for half a year. I’ve always been on the hunt for the best chiropractic office and my pain is replaced with manageable discomfort. Physical therapy and core strengthening exercises improved from the drop in pain. This is by far the cheapest option without insurance and most importantly there’s zero drop in quality compared to the “high end” offices, you feel a worlds difference leaving then arriving and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Couldn’t ask for a better place to take my spine for tuning!< /review>

< Review>
This has been the very first chiropractic experience for me and let me say that i am beyond satisfied. When i first came in monday i was a little worried that this wouldn't be the answer to my reoccurring issue but but my second appointment Tuesday i have yet to feel the pain that i walked in with. I am now moving in ways that i thought were impossible to move again, after just two days i know that i will forever be a loyal customer to "The joint" and i can now confidently go back to work without the fear of further injury.<//Review>

Dr. Tisdall is great, Vandana at the front desk is friendly. Quick and convenient.

The Joint is the quickest place to go for pain or for body alignment.  We should realize that just like car wheels, our joints, spine and neck need to be properly aligned too.< /review>

I've seen the adds and wondered if the $29 first was for real and if it was worth it. My first visit was with Dr Camacho. After he asked few questions, did assessment had some recommendations. I agreed with what he found and got ready to be treated. Let me tell you, just because your on the table, twisted like a pretzel, that does mean bones are going to start cracking. I didn't hear any cracking when we adjusted my back. Previous chiropractor's could crack my back either. However with Dr Camacho he warned me of possibly having some pain the following day and he was right. After a few hours I started sitting up not slouching like I normally do. Best part was I noticed my breathing. Never happened before.
During the assessment, Dr Camacho said I had a couple ribs out of place. Now I know what that means. Recently when coughing or sneezing I felt some small pains im my chest. Built up a sweat working out and had to blow my nose. I was surprised when I didn't feel any chest or back pain when I blew my nose.
Thanks Dr Camacho best $29 I spent in years. Looking forward to seeing you next week.</Review>

So just a few days ago I noticed my neck started to hurt. By the third day the pain was so bad that driving started to become an issue. So I decided to look for a place that would do walk ins and i have found The Joint Chiropractic near my house in Hercules. First day adjustment and i didn't feel any better of course. The pain and everything was still there. On the second day the pain was still there but it was bearable and driving wasn't as hard. On the third day the pain was still there but it felt better. My neck wasn't in so much pain that I had to have my head in a weird position for it to be bearable. There were still a little soreness but it felt better.</Text>

<text>My boyfriend recommended this place. I’ve had lower back and neck pain for over a month. Dr. Limon gave me a thorough assessment. He pointed out issues that I was aware but didn’t tell him. It was reassuring to know he could pinpoint my troubles areas by adjusting and feeling my neck and back-very impressive. The staff was also really friendly and informative.< /text>< Time>

So far I went in for initial consultation for the 29$ special.. the process was easy, you will need to fill out health history and the usual disclaimers...the process explained what they were going to do and eased my mind knowing that I'll be ok, so far the process has been easy for a first-timer to a chiropractor practice.  Looking forward to more visits.< /Review>

My back feels great after my adjustment from Dr. T, he asked me a good question about how much I invest in “self care” since my job requires a lot of physical labor. Made me realize I need to spend the time and money in myself which is much needed. Thank you for the warm welcome and great experience.<//Text>

Amazing staff! Walked-in and got adjustments done the same day. Walked out feeling much better than I did before I visited them. I had really bad pain in my neck and shoulders. Once adjustments were made, the pain and aching instantly went away and it felt great. Distance of motion improved greatly for my neck and shoulders, along with reduced aching and pain. Excellent customer service with chiropractors that actually know what they are doing. Pricing is very reasonable too. I highly recommend their services!< /Text>

< review>
Dr Limon is awesome and very knowledgable!!. At first i wasn't sure i was even going to go check it out,  the lady said  45 minute wait. Also been an ex ballet dancer,  i'm always a bit unsure as to whether the doctor really knows his stuff.   But what other options was there,  continue to suffer? Wait till Monday?  I woke up with my upper back and shoulder in pain and lots of it!
I decided to go,  and i was so pleasantly surprised.  Dr Limon is a master at what he does and the whole process was like 45 minutes, but i didn't sit in the waiting room for 45 minutes.
I loved the options,  go once or get on a plan if needed! I personally signed up since this is what my body needs right now! We are so lucky to have one with such good care and close to home!< /review>

Updates review: Went in after throwing out my back during a workout. The doctor was good at experience explaining what was wrong and a good way forward for my treatment. A couple days later and I feel noticeably better though I will probably need more adjustments to fix how much damage I did to myself. After initial visit, there was an issue with costs being explained. After posting my review, the owner actually called me directly, apologized and made it right. Doing something like that always manages to impress me and encourages me to give a business a second chance.<//Review>

<Review>Great and courteous service. Awesome communication system. They keep you updated every step of the  way. Yes, they are a bit more expensive than other shops but, quality does have a price and when you have an oldie but goody like mine, you want only the experts to take care of her!< /Review>< pics>

< review>
I am extremely disappointed in the service department at this dealership. I had an appointment and upon my arrival, I had to wait 15 minutes for someone to speak to me. Once they did, the person that "helped" me was completely unhelpful. He insisted on having my oil changed when that was NOT the reason I took my car in. Once I explained the reason for my visit, the tech proceeds to tell me that I would have to leave my car for a day or more to have it looked at. LOOKED at! Not to repair a problem once it was found but only to be looked at. When I asked why, he explained that they had a lot of cars to work on. I then ask what the point is of scheduling an appointment and he started to try to spin some story and I just left. So in essence, all they did was waste my time. I drove from Laguna Niguel, took time off work and was fed nothing but nonsense. I should mention that my other vehicle is a BMW and the difference in service is unbelievable. Hey, service manager, why don't you to one of their dealerships and learn a thing or two about how to treat your clients.< /review>

It was as good a car buying experience as one can have. Robbie and his sales team were not pushy and presented the facts fast and efficiently.

<review>We have been going to Santa Margarita Ford for years!  That is because we have always received exceptional service from all of their employees.  However, I must give a special shout out to customer rep, Miguel, who has gone above and beyond for me on many occasions.  He always keeps me updated on the status of my car, recalls and my extended warranty.  Best yet, he always does it with a smile!  Thank you Miguel as well as the rest of the team at SMF!</review><GmapID>0x80dcebae88c29fd3:0x94c20ab75bfc6b9<//GmapID><Pics>None</Pics></record>

<text>I absolutely love Santa Margarita Ford and would recommend to anyone.
A little over a year ago I came to this dealership to look for a car that would provide a bit more space, since my kids are involved in sports we really needed more leg room, and truck space.
Before I came here, I always had very painful experiences with dealerships. I’d get haggled, feel pressured, pushed to make a deal and made to feel as though that was the only deal I’d be able to get, etc. BUT when I came to SM Ford, the experience was quite the opposite.
I’ve always been told to never ever go alone to a dealership because I’ll get a bad deal...and they may be true for some places but not here. I walked onto that lot with my 2 kids in tow, and we were not pushed, or pressured at all from the moment we arrived. I was listened to, treated with respect and patience. The people I worked with related to me, treated me with fairness and worked hard to ensure that I drove off with a great experience and with the perfect car.
I can honestly say, I don’t think I ever want to go anywhere else. I’ll be directing all my friends and family there, and be going back if I ever want to get another vehicle! Oh—their service department is great as well!</text>< user_id>

I had a very positive experience. They follow up, as good sales people do, but they don't keep pressing you so I didn't feel pressure. They led with good terms, rather than a "quote high, watch them buy" mentality, and I felt good about the terms I agreed to. They gave me space to look at and consider different options, rather than direct me in any way. Everyone was courteous and responsive. Getting in and out with my new car was stress-free and didn't take a ton of time. I would definitely recommend this dealership to friends and family.< /Review>

<text>Wonderful experience! From beginning to end, the service provided was top notch with very attentive and caring employees, going above and beyond to ensure my car needs were properly adhered to. My service advisor Miguel, took the time to update me frequently, and went so far as to have my car washed and vacuumed so it was looking brand new upon pick up! Will definitely return here time and time again for all my car needs!<//text><rating>5</rating>< username>

<review>I had my first service on my Ford Escape 2020.  My service rep is Duane Litz. He got my car in right away and it was done under the estimated time. When I picked my car up it was washed and cleaned and looks brand new. Also I was having some issues on how to work some of the features on the car. So one of the reps name George sat in the car with me explained everything. The next day I had an issue with the hood on my car with some marks that were not their fault but mine. I took my car in and talk to George and he brought Duane out to my car and within minutes they had it buffed out and I was on my way. The service there is outstanding and I’m very happy with it. I would certainly buy another car and recommend Rancho Santa Margarita Ford. Kelly 🚗💨<//review>< Pics>

The employees were super friendly and helpful. The only issue I had was that I had to wait an hour and a half just to get my car battery tested and to put a new battery in, and no one updated me on the progress of my car until I went up and asked them. I understand car dealerships can be really busy in their service department, it just would’ve been nice to know the time frame a head of time. They did give me a complimentary car wash, so that was great.< /text>

<review>Who here has bought a vehicle and spent hours waiting... negotiating... buying accessories... having your kids whine they are hungry. Been there... and I can tell you working with Robbie Moore the experience was far from the one described. If you want to deal with a straight shooter... no nonsense... he got my paperwork to me... I did it almost all online. When I got to the dealer he already had the truck washed, waiting out front... I even bought the truck and relied on his description and FaceTime video. His description was perfect and the truck was BETTER than he had described. If you want a new experience with a car dealership... give Robbie a call at Santa Margarita Ford. I was done in 30 min and had the keys to my new car!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I felt like the most important guy in the store and Brandon basically sold me a car without "selling me" on a car. I NEVER buy a car on the first visit to a dealership, but somehow I did this time, with zero buyers remorse. That sale would have normally not happened on that night.

Santa Margarita Ford dealership is truly amazing. The entire staff is professional and friendly. I purchased my Raptor from SM Ford and Eric Habermehl the Sales Manager, Sales Associate Skye Saab and Ramon RC Cabral the Finance Manager truly made it the best vehicle purchase experience that I've ever had.

It was the most relaxing vehicle purchase that I've ever made and I've purchased numerous vehicles in my lifetime. The entire dealership staff is professional and friendly and very acomidating to the customer needs. So if your researching dealerships to purchase a vehicle and to service your vehicle you will absolutely be amazed in choosing SM Ford in Rancho Santa Margarita, California.

Always efficient service.  I bought my car here.  I make an early appointment and they finish in an hour and a half while I wait.  Been doing this for 5 years.
2021-bought a used car from Shift and Sirius XM wouldn't connect.  Took it in and they diagnosed with no charge.  Now to get Shift to take care of the $1,000 repair which they seem to be on top of.<//review>

Michael, the new guy from chicago helped my wife and I out and we appreciate him very much, as well as the rest of the team. I literally locked all three keys in the car within 2 hours of buying the car trying to set up a new code for the keyless entry and calls right before closing on Sunday and R.C. was able to run the VIN and get the stock code. I literally just waxed my beautiful new car, I was three beers deep and the car was parked half in and out of my garage... So I appreciate the help and the new car, and the trade in, and the service department for help on my other ford's.< /Review><userid>102871050608246813858</userid></record>

We took the car in because power steering fluid was leaking.  We thought maybe the reservoir had a leak.  The dealership said we need a new kit for the rack and pinion.  They took 3 days and charged $2400.  They released an UNSAFE car to my wife just before our trip to Mammoth (which they knew we were waiting on the car for).  They had delayed our trip.  On our way to Mammoth we discovered that they had not fixed the power steering leak and in fact had made it worse.  We lost control of the power steering in mountain driving conditions and had to keep refilling it.  Meanwhile the power steering was coating the inside of the engine compartment.  I didn't appreciate the fact that when I said to our service manager Duane that they released an unsafe car to us, his response is that we made it didn't we.  To their credit they took the car for another 3 days, figured out that they needed to replace the reservoir because there were fragments in the line and reservoir.  They did clean the engine compartment as requested (although not very well since it still smells like power steering fluid).  I took the car to the Camino Capistrano Ford dealership and they replaced the cabin filter which helped with the Power Steering odor .  They said they would reimburse us for the mechanic we paid up in Mammoth but I'll be surprised if the actually do.  We bought our car from this dealership but I strongly suggest you don't use their service department.  It is the worst!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1611595837023, 'text': 'Hello Mr. Sherby, First off, I apologize to you if you feel that I did not properly explain to you the power steering issues that your vehicle had when I met with you and your wife in person last week. I did in fact process the reimbursement request and you should have the check by now as I did authorize it when your wife sent me the receipts. In regards to the Flex’s power steering issues the vehicle was brought into us for a power steering leak. We inspected the vehicle and found that the rack and pinion were leaking profusely and there was a lot of fluid everywhere. We replaced the rack and pinion and purged the system followed up by a road test. When we were contacted about the troubles you experienced on the road trip, we promptly addressed them when the car was in our possession. I also authorized the reimbursement on the inspection the independent did in Mammoth. Due to the fact that parts for your vehicle are extremely limited due to age, I authorized replacing the pump and reservoir after locating both. The reservoir had become restricted and the system was unable to properly burp. There were many fragments and particles and that is why I decided to replace the pump as a pre-emptive measure. I understand that it has been a frustrating experience and again, I apologize. If you would like to discuss this further, I am available to assist you further.

Fantastic experience buying our vehicle here. Shervin was honest, straightforward, and made the buying process as seamless as I have ever had from a dealer. He is a rockstar. RC in finance was knowledgeable and great to work with as well. Excellent service and a nice showroom all around, very clean and inviting. I highly recommend checking out this dealership if you are in the market for a new Ford.< /review>

My wife recently purchased a car from Santa Margarita Ford. We worked with Robbie Moore and it was a smooth purchasing process.  We texted and he offered a price for a Ford Edge that my wife and I were happy with. A few days later my wife showed up to purchase the car and was given the deal that was already promised. Robbie Moore was great at making sure the process didn't waste anytime and later texted to apologize for any delays. After years of buying and leasing cars, I believe we have found our permanent dealership to work with.  Thank you Robbie Moore and Santa Margarita Ford.< /Review>

<Text>The tough part was deciding which make and model of pickup I wanted to buy.  Once I landed on a Ford Raptor, choosing the dealership was easy!  I have heard so many great things about Santa Margarita Ford over the last 20+ years that I knew this was the only place to go.

Sales manager Jason Saling, Finance Manager Dave Franco and Sales Rep Skye Saab treated me like a king, were very efficient, friendly, knowledgeable and professional every step of the way.  The team that the Graham family has assembled here is so impressive.  In the high-turnover auto dealer industry, people come to work at Santa Margarita Ford and stay!  Most I met have been with the store 10 to 30 years!  Impressive!  That means the same person will be there to help you throughout your ownership experience!< /Text>< gmapID>

Update (as of 09/17):
Gina was able to reach out to me today, and I finally felt that my concerns were finally addressed. When she first called me and identified herself from RSM Ford, I have to admit that I was initially annoyed and defensive during our conversation.

However, during that call she allowed me to gain her trust and I was able to express my experiences (the 3 visits so far). I felt that she understood my concerns and she's an excellent active listener.

I mentioned that I have nothing personal against the Service Advisor who (tried to) assisted me, however the customer experience I went through can be greatly improved.

At first, I decided to go have my SUV serviced at RSM Ford due to the convenience factor; it's nice to know that if I wanted to make an appointment, it can literally be done same day (which is kind of unheard of when it comes to other dealerships)!

After talking with Gina to finally air things out, I now do not think discrimination took place; it was just a misunderstanding with the Service Advisor who unknowingly didn't know how to de-escalate situations.

Gina has restored my faith in this dealership, and I may give them another chance during my next service visit. If this momentum continues, I may seriously consider SM Ford for my next vehicle purchase (hopefully the new Bronco within the next 2 years).

Because of Gina, I'm updating their rating from 1 to 4 stars.
-----------------------------------------------------

Review is for the Service Department...

A few months ago, I recently leased a 2020 Explorer ST from another Ford dealership. I currently live in Lake Forest, and the dealership I leased it from is in Orange (closed to where I used to live).

Since Santa Margarita Ford is my nearest dealership, I decided to take my SUV over here since it seems they're not busy (just calling in for an appointment, I can drop it off whenever).

I visited this dealership 3 times:
1st - Had a hyperblinking issue on the left turn signal that bothered me ($60k for a brand new car having this issue, and wanted to get it corrected). Please note this issue was not resolved by SM Ford, and that I had to have my originating dealer resolve it for me (even though SM Ford knew of the problem, but didn't want to help me since they're stating that it may not be covered under warranty).

2nd - Reverse camera intermittently is non-functional (displays blue screen). Please note that this issue is not currently resolved, but SM Ford technically ignored the problem and told me to wait for recall notice. I got my originating dealership involved, and they are ordering me a new reverse camera.

3rd - Broken seat panel caused by my second visit to SM Ford. During that visit, I noticed upon picking up my car that the power driver seat panel was slightly hanging. I briefly dismissed the issue because I thought the mechanic had to go under the seat (for reasons unknown) and forgot to clip the cover back on. Flash forward a week later when I cleaned my card, and discovered that a plastic clip was actually broken. Mentioned it to my Service Advisor and he misled me regarding the timeline (initially said the part will come in later that week, but upon my follow-up call today he's now stating the end of this month).

My overall experience at Santa Margarita Ford has been very negative, including the broken seat panel issue. I'm writing this review because I just got off the phone with SM Ford's Service Advisor (please note that I had to call because he hasn't been following up with me), and he now states that the part in question is on backorder and they should expect an update by the end of the month. Very non-confident on his part. By that point, I expressed my frustration to him, and even called him out on excuses he's been stringing me along to.

I just gave up at this point, and called my advisor at the Orange dealership regarding the broken seat issue that SM Ford caused, and he told me to bring it in and will take care of it for me...<//review>

It certainly isn’t our intention to inconvenience our customers, but it sounds like we did just that. From your review it’s unclear if you were able to repair the seat panel issue. Given the opportunity, perhaps we can help out with that in the future if it hasn’t been addressed already. Life has certainly been challenging lately, and I’m afraid that your experience was an unfortunate by-product of the general confusion given the pandemic, Ford Motor Company’s own struggles (especially with parts), and our own internal communication breakdowns. Sal is relatively new to the position, but I’m confident he meant you no ill-will. He’s a nice young man that works very hard.\n\nI would like to address your ending comment about discrimination. We take these sort of allegations VERY SERIOUSLY. I would invite you to contact me personally to discuss your concerns further. My email is james@smford.us and my direct phone line is 949.709.6033.

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>As a return loyal patron, I have always valued the quality and reliability of the service performed on my 2013 Ford F150 crew cab 4x4 by the service team at Rancho Santa Margarita Ford. Gina Allen, Director of Fixed Operations and Miguel Aparicio, Assistant Service Manager made sure that I was satisfied with my experience and went the extra mile as they always do. I had one recall, a major 100k mile tune up and complete fuel system induction cleaning, oil change, full vehicle inspection and tire rotation and the service provided by the team went well and repairs are guaranteed for 24 months.

We had an excellent experience at Santa Margarita Ford. Cory Sweeney helped us find the right car, a 2019 Ranger. He was very transparent through the whole process and made me confident that we made the right choice. RC helped us with our financing and did a great job explaining everything for us. Thanks to the sales team for making our first car buying experience a positive one!< /text>

<text>Went to nearly a dozen different dealerships. I don’t leave negative reviews typically, but a lot of those other dealerships would get them if I did. Santa Margarita Ford was amazing to work with, straight forward, didn’t try to hide any fees or sell me anything I didn’t need. I told them what I wanted and they made the deal work. I would refer anyone looking for a car to them.<//text>< Pics>

Lisa helped me out and was really nice.  I was up front about not being interested in buying that day and the dealership wasn’t pushy (a major plus in my book).  Came back to check the car out a second time with my husband and was helped by Eric.  Paid cash and was impressed by our experience.  Fast service.  Not pushy.  Would definitely do business with them again.  Thank you again Eric, Lisa and the guy in finance (so sorry, I can’t recall your name!!!).  You all were fantastic!< /review>< pics>

Any time I go for service here, I get the worst attitude and customer service. The employees ignore you and make you wait while they are having personal conversations. The woman who I think is the service manager is obnoxious and rude, always acting as though you are a burden. I've taken my car here for years and I will not be coming back. When you bring your car in for service, you expect to be treated nicely. This place does the opposite.<//Text>

I had a good experience at Santa Margarita Ford. I stumbled upon the exact truck I was looking for online, it was at this dealer. I called and was put in-touch with a very friendly salesman who owned the same truck himself, named Drazen. I worked out a time to come down and check out the truck. When I showed up, they had parked the exact truck at the main entrance of the building and it had already been detailed inside and out. I got a very good vibe from Drazen, and the dealership as a whole. The deal on the truck was fair, we were in and out very quickly. My wife and I are very happy with our truck, and our entire experience with Santa Margarita Ford. Thanks again Drazen!</text>

Dan Hernandez has helped me with 5 truck purchases for my company, I could not imagine an easier process.
From our 1st contact with him for this last purchase,  we contacted him, got a price back within a 1/2 hour and went down to pick up the truck within 3 hours. No haggling no games just an honest price and a easy process.
I have and will continue to recommend Dan for any one who wants to buy a vehicle from the fleet department, thanks again Dan for making it happen.<//text>

Home of the surprise fees. I TWICE asked for a full list of fees. One of the conversations was even with the salesman and manager. I was never sent a list, but told by the manager of “all” the fees and assured that was everything. A couple days later, I again asked the salesman if there were ANY other fees I need to be aware of. Nope. I was traveling to California from another state to buy the car and while our way to the airport, I was sent a written list of all costs. Sure enough, a new fee. I asked what this fee was, and was told he would chase that down. A few minutes later, I was texted yet another mystery fee. I expressed my concern with the blatant disregard for any of our previous conversations and told them I’m heading to the airport to buy your vehicle - but I’m not paying any of these new fees. Then came my favorite line, “Sorry, nothing we can do.” After making it very clear I’m not paying any new fees they conjure up, they removed one fee but not the other. I don’t know if this is intentional or incompetence, but I’m certain the fees would’ve just keep appearing. So I walked away.<//review>

To start with, I’ve never found the process of buying a car to be all that enjoyable.  I have physical pain issues that effect my daily life.  Sitting for long periods and standing can cause back and leg spasms.  Needless to say, the number one most important feature on any car I drive will come down to how comfortable the seat is.  I relayed the importance of this to Cory Sweeney, (salesperson) who sold me my new Ford Edge ST when I arrived that day.  He asked me a few other important questions right away to better service my needs.  I appreciated the way he went about narrowing down the process for me by simplifying it.  What’s my price range?  How big of car do you need?  Do you want leather or fabric interior etc?...After a minute or so, he had me ready to test drive the Ford Edge ST and the Ford Edge SEL.  But before he went inside the dealership to grab the keys, Cory asked how I was doing and if I’d like a water or something to drink.  He directed me to a shaded area near the entrance w/a table and bench where I could sit for a moment while he retrieved the car keys for me to test drive the Edge ST first.  I think Cory must have known this would be the car for me so he wanted me to test out the seat and compare it against the Edge SEL seat.  After driving both cars, the ST won me over!  Cory made the rest of the transaction as smooth as possible.  He hustled all day and made it happen on my end by finding me a couple great discounts that I could use to bring my final price down.  It’s clear that Cory’s there to get the deal done for you!  When people ask me where I bought my Edge ST (and they will 😉), I’ll be telling them to go see Cory at Santa Margarita Ford!!!< /text>

<GmapID>0x80dcebae88c29fd3:0x94c20ab75bfc6b9<//GmapID><Review>Choose SM Ford on a recommendation when we bought our Escape Hybrid. Worked with John Hadden and loved the fact that he made us aware of other deals going on with the Edge, Explorer, etc even though we had come in specifically for the Escape. No pressure on which car make or model to choose from. John has also made sure to stay in regular contact with us to make sure our car experience continues to be a good one. Have had basic maintenance service done and it has always been a worry free and easy process. Would highly recommend you check out SM Ford. Great community business partner as well.

Update 4/28/21

So I write my original review 2 years ago and just finished another emergency car issue with SM Ford and Miguel. My hybrid car started having starting issues and I knew because of the complexity of an old hybrid car I didn't trust anybody else to correctly diagnosed the issue. Miguel and his team once again came through for me and was able to resolve and fix my issues at a fraction of the cost I thought I would need to pay which is a complete hybrid battery replacement. Locations at different times and the fact that Miguel always gives me options versus a one-fix solution which is a great way to earn my trust versus thinking of being taken on the money grab. Thanks Miguel and Santa Margarita Ford for another great service and fixing my car and not forcing me to buy a new one!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

< review>
Best car leasing experience we've ever had! My husband and I were bummed to find out our previous car salesman (who we really liked) from another dealership left with no forwarding info so I immediately jumped on Yelp to see if I could find some good reviews and I'm so glad I did.

Special shoutout to ALL the people who wrote about their positive experience with Robbie Moore! The great reviews are no joke, he is as good as it gets. No sales pitch, down to earth, easy going, friendly, he was genuinely interested in getting us the deal we wanted and he totally took care of us like we were family. I would call him the "anti-salesman" because he is nothing like your typical car salesman.

Our lease was not expiring for another month so we didn't intend to buy a car the day we went in to meet him but he made us a deal we couldn't refuse and ended up leaving with the car we wanted and a lower payment.

If you want to have a great car buying/leasing experience ask for Robbie, he's the man!

I also want to add that Brian Carpenter in financing was awesome to work with as well. Really personable and made the paperwork process a breeze.< /review>

SKYE and RC were great to us when buying a Ford Explorer. We went to another dealer and got a completly different terrible experiance. We drove 1.5 hiurs to come test drive with Skye and he was very nice. We loved how he was outright honest from the beginning about everything. He was able to tell us everything we wanted to know. When we met the Service Manager we knew we were going to have a great experiance from this dealership, we cant remember his name but we would have loved to shout him out. We came in to get the exact payment we were looking to get for the exact car we wanted. The Finance Manager also gave us the same kind of friendliness and professionalism that it was easy to talk to him! All together, I would reccomend this Ford over any others to anyone.</Text>

I purchased a 2017 Ford Mustang from a different Ford dealer. Within 7 months, I noticed a noise coming from the transmission and differential when shifting in and out of park. I called the dealer in an attempt to get it fixed under warranty and they advised me of a wait time of over two months. Instead of waiting two months, I went with Santa Margarita Ford due to its proximity to my home. I called in at 7am, right when they opened on a weekday. They scheduled me to come within an hour. I brought in my car and spoke to Miguel in the services department. He told me the issue would be looked into the same day. I left my car with the dealership and five hours later received a phone call from Miguel stating the problem was identified and could be fixed overnight. I agreed to the overnight service and picked up my car the very next day. Everything was covered under warranty and the process was completely smooth and painless. After my great experience here, I realized I should have went to Santa Margarita Ford before buying elsewhere. Highly recommended.<//text>

This is my seventh purchase from Santa Margarita Ford. Recently purchased 2018 F150. Our salesman Robbie Moore was outstanding as usual; 5 star plus!. Robbie is your go to guy. Robbie is a straight shooter type of guy, honest, and will work hard for you. Special shout out for James for making it happen. If you need a Ford or Toyota see them, you will not be disappointed.

< review>
Last week I purchased a new Ford Fusion Hybrid from this company.  I've done business with them many times over the years, but not recently.  I was very pleased to discover many of, the same staff continues to work at this agency, and that is very unusual in today's marketplace.  I worked closely with Scott ( salesperson ) and Ellen ( Sales Manager ) to explore my options and the pricing.

SM Ford had the car I wanted in stock.  I had performed ample research and several other companies gave me written quotes.  The ultimate price I paid, and the trade in I received, is competitive with the best offers presented.  I am the pleased owner of a new car, and I have the assurance when I experience the normal issues present with today's advanced technology, the staff here will take care of my needs pleasantly, effectively, and in a timely manner.

I have recommended this company to friends and family many times.  On follow-up, my referrals report a professional attitude presented by all of the staff, and satisfaction when they ultimately reach a deal on a vehicle they are seeking.  I would encourage anyone to reach out to this company to discuss the new vehicle opportunities they offer.  Of course, if its a used car you are seeking, they have some very nice options available.<//review>

I am co-borrower on three daughters vehicles and I recently refinanced, so I thought my credit would be an issue.

This dealer will be my top of the list dealership in OC! Had an issue with my rear back up camera called in for a quick appointment so they can diagnose it, took my car in and have them check it out. unfortunately due to my work schedule I needed the car by certain time so I called them, they told me that they'll set up an appointment at my convenience so I did. Brought the car back after few days which it will not interfere to my work schedule. Diagnosed was done and they confirmed, KYLE was the service rep. to notify me that they will order the parts and change it. Recieved call again from a rep saying that parts arrived and ready to be install so I went and drop the car, offer me a ride back home. Couple of hours later they called me again saying that my car is done and ready to pick it up. Again they offer me a ride from home to dealer which is a nice courtesy, saw my car parked, fixed the issue and they cleaned it as well. Very satisfied with the service representative!!<//Text>

<Review>I really enjoyed my experience with Santa Margarita Ford. I went in on Christmas Eve and was treated very well. Blake took great care in showing me several F-150's till we found just the right one. John was great as well getting through the paperwork quickly and explaining everything. I had to return to get the bed liner installed a few days later and Dwayne in the service department was terrific. Thank you guys! Have a Happy new year.< /Review>< pictures>

As always my experience with the service dept was excellent. Tony is efficient, informative, kind & considerate. It is very comforting to have a representative to handle as well as anticipate your service questions and concerns. His does a fantastic job & I am a very happy customer.
I would also need to mention Cesar, the gentleman Tony arranged to drive me home. Cesar is another feather in the RSM Ford cap. He is professional & courteous. He is fun & maintains a good conversation. It was a joy speaking with him.< /Text>

Santa Margarita Ford makes everything so easy when it comes to the service center. I recently went to Santa Margarita Ford for a routine oil change and my 30,000 mile service. Miguel Aparicio is simply the best and made sure everything went perfectly with my service. He kept me updated on when my car would be ready and even left my car with the sales floor so I could pick up my car after the service center was closed. If you need any service done on your Ford you should reach out to this dealership and ask for Miguel. As always Santa Margarita Ford goes above and beyond in the customer service area and I am so thankful I have this dealership to go to for service of my car.<//Text>

<review>These guys rock.  I called them at 2:45pm on Sunday.  They had the exact car I was looking for.  Not only did Robbie matched the deal I was looking for over the phone, they provided the best car buying experience I have had when I got there.  I let them know I was on a tight schedule and I was going to be there by 3:15pm, and needed to leave by 4:30pm.  Robbie and John the finance manager had me out of there by 4:30 with the exact car I wanted and the price I wanted.

Kudos to Robbie and John and the whole team for making it happen so fast.<//review>< Pics>

We purchased a 2011 Ford Explorer last week from Santa Margarita Ford. From beginning to end, our customer service was top notch. We were not a slam-dunk sale, as we had some non-negotiable parameters, and preferences for our new car. Our salesperson, Scott, and the sales manager, Ellen, worked closely with us for about a month prior to our purchase to ensure that we got the car that was exactly right for our family of 5. The financing paperwork went smoothly and efficiently. Post-sale, there were a few repairs that needed to be made. Ellen made that transaction very easy, giving us another Explorer to drive for the day, and even detailing our car before we got it back. We had an overall terrific experience and highly recommend Santa Margarita Ford.< /text>

My experience at Santa Margarita Ford was fantastic. We used Costco pricing and got the deal that we really were hoping for. Sales staff was really helpful and the finance guy was easy to work with too. driving the truck off the lot was a dream. We got everything that we liked and wanted and there was basically no pressure at all. They also were really good at identifying all of the features and functionality on the truck and I would shop there again and recommended buying a car or truck from Margarita Ford to all my friends and neighbors. I hope the service is as good as the sales. I guess I find out as soon as I take my truck in for its first service. Thanks for all your help< /text>

The car that i went to Check was nice, and the price too, however i left right of way because the Salesman breath smells like beer,  and his eyes were kind of red, he was more interested on leaving than talking to me, I'm sure he had a long night. that  tells me a lot about professionalism of the business. How sad i really want it to make a deal, i even had an open check from my bank with me.<//Review>

<review>I purchased a certified pre owned 2015 Ford F-150 from Santa margarita Ford only to be dealt with A really bad POS and the extended warranty they sold me was the PORTFOLIO one where I have to take it into Santa margarita only, not any dealer like I was told. The truck is currently at Santa margarita ford with a list of items that are bad and of a safety concern where the safety of my family is put at risk. How was it that this truck was certified preowned? Somebody at this dealer pencil whipped the check off list. First the rear axle housing was leaking, then the tires were bad to where I had to get new ones then the A pimm module went bad, then the rear sliding glass came off because ford did not prime the surface it was glued on, then on two separate occasions two different ignition modules went bad. Then the stereo whet bad to where it was removed and disposed of with my CDs in it. Now it currently has the passenger side turbo going out, the back up sensors are inoperable, the front left axle hub is grinding, when you turn off the truck with the push button it proceeds to start itself up, the 4wd transfer case is grinding, the passenger vanity mirror stays on to where it gets extremely hot and began to melt the plastic cover, the side view mirrors both are stuck and snap when adjusted. I called James Graham and voiced my concerns only to be disrespected! He first offered to take me out of the truck and put me in a new one (more money, loss on my end and all gain on his) when I was blunt and told him I felt as if I got a lemon his response was “let’s just stop there! If it’s a lemon law you’re looking for then speak to an attorney!”. Santa Margarita Ford prides itself and being a customer service giant when in reality all they do is be condescending and disrespectful and lie to you! no different than a typical fly by night used car dealership. Instead of admitting that it may be possible that the truck may have been overlooked, they would rather disrespect you and put you down, Henry Ford himself would be ashamed that this dealer is using his name. Anybody looking to purchase from Santa Margarita ford should stay away!!!! Be warned!!! Be cautious of the warranty offered and don’t trust the certified pre owned BS!

Update 8/29/19 10:55am I was contacted by Gina Allen (Parts and Service Director) of SMF and was told because this review was posted they were not going To no longer work on my truck even though the warranty they sold me was to be repaired at Santa Margarita Ford they are now  refusing to complete the work on my truck because of the negative review and are asking that the rental be returned and I said no I will not return until my truck is repaired and Gina continued to state that she was going to report the rental stolen. I cannot believe that they are willing to throw a tantrum and put me back into an unsafe vehicle without honoring warranty issues because of a bad review and bad actions on their part. This will be a legal matter if they force me back into that unsafe vehicle without being repaired. I will continue to update with fraudulent actions on behalf of Santa Margarita Ford until this matter is resolved correctly.

Update 08/29/19 1:55pm  upon arriving at Santa Margarita Ford I had to wait 20 minutes to speak to Gina about the prior conversation  in which I was told if I did not bring the vehicle back it would be reported stolen and to pick my truck up. She continued to tell me because I wrote the review in a negative light they were no longer going to do any work on the truck and not honor the warranty....because of the review. At this point Gina and James both sat down to talk to me to advise me that because of that review and the fact that I had an opinion negative towards Santa Margarita Ford they were no longer intrested in my business. They both continued to say that I was rude and disrespectful, I asked them why was I disrespectful and James said because I wrote the review. Then towed my truck out of SMF and on to chino ford. Bad business ethics. Beware bad review= your warranty not honored.</review>< pics>

Nothing like football to help make buying a car a little more relaxing. We purchased a lightly used Escape on Sunday from Robbie while hanging out and watching a game. Great experience, great deal and John H made  signing the paperwork quick and painless.< /review>

I would recommend this dealership to any of our relatives, friends or anybody to ask about my new Ford.

I have been bringing my work truck into Santa Margarita Ford for some time now. I am confident saying I always get great, friendly and most importantly HONEST service! When it was time to upgrade to a new truck, there is nowhere else I would feel comfortable going. I got a fair price for my trade in, a great deal on my new truck and I feel like I was buying a car from a good friend instead of a “car salesman”.   I will never go to another dealership for anything if I can help it and I would gladly tow my vehicles 200miles to get good, honest service. Thank You Santa Margarita Ford for all your help, awesome service, and a car buying experience like I’ve never had before! You guys are #1 in my book!< /review>

I found myself coming away very satisfied and confident that I got a really an outstanding used vehicle. I think that if you were considering a purchase with Santa Margarita Ford you can feel confident that you will be treated well by the sales staff eager to give you a great experience. I worked with Scott and he was one of the best salesmen ever in my multiple experiences buying a car all over the country. If you are willing to take the chance, you'll come away with a really great deal at Santa Margarita Ford.< /review>< pics>

Bought my Focus here last May.  Tom G. made the purchase experience much better than past experiences I have had at other dealerships. He found ways to save me money during the process, spent time going over the features and functions of the car. Have recommended this dealership to others, and will continue to do so.  Took my Focus in this morning for its 2nd service. Staff was very friendly, service was quick. They even washed the car for me when finished with the work. This dealership gets a top rating from me for sure.< /text>

The only issue I had was my 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minute promised time stretched into 1 hour and 45 minutes. Other then that the service was free with the coupons and they made reasonable suggestions of other stuff that needed to be done.< /Text>< username>

I recently brought my Ford Explorer in for a warranty issue, Miguel was my service advisor. Miguel's customer service is top notch, he provided me with daily updates on my car, he is very professional, personable and quite funny. I have never used the service department at SM Ford as I have my own mechanic but after the customer service Miguel provided me I will be switching over to SM Ford for service.
Thank you Miguel!

Great job Santa Margarita Ford!

Car buying can be a fun but highly stressful process.The right dealership can make the most of the fun and minimize the stress.  That's exactly what happened at this Ford dealership.

The car was mainly for my wife, and her evaluation process is way different than mine.  Our sales rep, Blake, was awesome. He took both my wife's and my style into account when answering questions and explaining features. We never felt any pressure - we just good product knowledge and a friendly attitude.

Ultimately, we went back 2 to 3 times narrowing down and finalizing our decision.  Each time Blake was as patient as he was on our original visit. Blake then had to source out a few other dealerships to get a Focus with the exact options we wanted and he did so quickly and professionally.

We got a great deal and were able to buy locally (Rancho Santa Margarita), which made it all the better.

John in the Finance and Insurance department also really came through, too.  He significantly beat our pre-approved bank rate (from our credit union). I was also interested in an extended warranty and he presented all the options and also did some extra paperwork when I decided to make some last minute changes.

I'd definitely recommend looking at Ford when you're considering a new car and Santa Margarita Ford is a great place to shop and buy!</Review>

<Review>We knew exactly what kind of car we wanted - found that they had what we were looking for on their lot. Called them before driving up there and Robbie Moore promptly called us back letting us know what our trade in would be work, and financing for a new vehicle. Drove up that day and got exactly what we wanted. Robbie made the process very simple, along with their financing department, and never once did I feel forced or backed into a corner. Wish we weren't moving back home so we could continue to do business with them!</Review>< response>

I came here with my family to look for a truck on the lot. The guy that helped us had no idea what was going on. A few months later I contacted SMF to inquire about getting a new truck. I didn’t end up getting one from this dealership, but was impressed with the level of service that I was given. I’d like to mention Ryan as the person who helped me promptly after I contacted them. Keep up the good work guys.</text>

Truly a remarkable company. Ever since I bought my F-150 in 2004 the experiences have been exceptional. Every time I go here I'm treated like family, it's like the Olive Garden without the garlic breath. Seriously, they really do "Get it"! I will continue to be a loyal customer for a long time, and especially now that I'm thinking about that new Fusion.<//text>

Great buying experience with Fleet Manager Tom Glockner.  Quoted bottom line price on SD 250 online. No pressure, hassle free, friendly service. Purchase took about an hour at dealership. Great follow up phone call from Tom.

I highly recommend Santa Margarita Ford.< /text>

It was quick, painless, and you were treated very well. While waiting for my car they suggested to use the VIP lounge and I got a ton of work done while waiting for my car to be serviced.< /text><Name>Liz Nare< /Name></record></dataset><record>

I have been having a problem with my Trunk Lid staying open when on a slanted drive way. I explained that my wife has the same car but newer and she does not have that problem. I was told there is nothing Ford can due to fix this problem. Pretty bad when you spend $37,000. Dollars for a car and they can't fix a trunk lid from falling on your head!!!<//Text>

We have been loyal customers for years and will continue to do so.  We are treated like family, always on a first name basis.  Customer service is second to none!  I would highly recommend Santa Margarita Ford to anyone, for a new purchase or for service, they can't be beat.</Review>

<text>㋡ I have always had nothing but the best from the team at Santa Margarita Ford, their Service department is very professional quick and performs honest and quality service assessments and repairs.

Over the years I have worked with Duane, Jeremy and many others in the Service department and every time they have all gone above and beyond to make sure I am shuttled home and back on the road before the day is done.

I once had a problem that I thought was a transition issue but the service team found the problem was a faulty coil pack and spark plug ultimately saving me thousands in transition diagnostics and repair cost.

Thank you to the staff at Santa Margarita Ford.

<Review>After having a less than positive experience with a Chevrolet dealer in Carson, we drove to Santa Margarita Ford to see if they could help me.
My daughter had purchased a car there and was overwhelmed by how
wonderful they were with her, so I decided to see if they would repeat the experience with me.  Unfortunately, they didn't have a car on the lot that met my requirements, but it didn't end there!  I had to get a car that day so Robbie Moore found the perfect car for me at another dealership, called them and arranged for me to meet with the manager and helped me get an amazing deal.  I live 2 hours away but would not hesitate to return to Santa Margarita Ford next time I need a car.  Mike and Robbie are warm, caring and wonderfully professional.  I was blessed by my experience and you will be too.</Review>< pics>

The service department always accommodates me quickly upon my phone call to set an appointment or in an emergency. The staff is always polite and answers all my questions and addresses all my concerns without pause, even down to the shuttle drivers are very polite, I can't say enough about them and that's why I gave them five stars<//review>

<time>1382981866980< /time><rating>5</rating><Text>On Saturday, Oct 26, I brought in my Ford Escape for an oil change.  When I left the dealership I went about 100 feet and my car just stopped.  I called Peter in service and he sent out one of the mechanics.  He checked under the hood and had me restart the car.  It started, so he asked me to turn around and bring the car back.  It quit again before I could get back.  I called and they sent back the mechanic, this time in a car and he pushed me off to the side and he called his supervisor who came out.  They got me back to the dealership and took me home.  They managed to diagnose what was wrong with the car and repaired it and picked me up and brought me back to get my car before they closed for the day. Each time I called Peter, he took care of the situation immediately and I really appreciate it.  Every one of the people I dealt with that day were great.  I bought my car from Santa Margarita Ford and have had all maintenance performed there.  I wouldn't go anywhere else.  Thanks again.</Text>< pics>

Dealership did not have vehicle we came to test drive.  We test drove something similar, which gave us an idea of the features of the vehicle we came to see.  Sales representative tried to sell vehicles on the lot instead of the vehicle we want.  Friendly and courteous staff.  Lot was very appealing.<//review>

NEVER taking my car here for service again. I gave it a try because it is my closest dealership, but man, they need a quality control check. My steering wheel had a dent in it, the wheels were scratched by the tools used to remove the wheels, and the best part, a $300 spark plug change! Within 3 minutes of searching elsewhere, I was quoted $45 to change the spark plugs (I had my own I wanted installed). Ford RSM, why should I pay your tech $300 for a two hour spark plug change when every other resource says it takes 15-20 minutes top, and requires 4 tools. Scam and a half<//text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Took my new car in for a slight issue with the windshield and took my grandson with me for the ride.  My grandson is in winter baseball and wanted to practice catching fly balls and grounders.  The people at Sana Margarita Ford told us how to get to a nearby part on a walking trail.  As my car was getting serviced, my grandson and I had a great time playing ball.  We went back to the dealer and Charlie gave us and ice cream while we were waiting.  Everybody at the dealership were very nice and made our wait comfortable.
Talk about a family friendly car dealership, this is it.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Great dealership.  Just bought my third car from them.  John and Scott in Sales delivered and John in Finance had all the paperwork ready when we arrived (and exactly what was negotiated).  Duane in Service always takes care of our cars and it's worth the drive for the service.< /review>

Very pleased with my experience at Santa Margarita Ford.  Not to say it was totally smooth, but after expressing dissatisfaction, the Sales team was responsive and acted quickly to resolve my problem.  I felt I got a fair and reasonable price and the vehicle I wanted without having to compromise.  I look forward to doing future business with Santa Margarita Ford.  I'm also extremely pleased with my Ford Focus ST....  Perfect car for me and I looked at ALL makes and models available today!  Thank you!</text>

< review>
Bought a car a year ago and still dealing with them on fixing an issue to correct with the DMV since they did not transfer my personal plates.  After numerous call and emails still getting penalty letters from DMV after a year.  No one takes any ownership of the problem.  Super frustrating as I thought this was a family hometown dealership and I live in the area.     I thought it would great to support the local area businesses however I am now second guessing my decision.  Happy to spend my $$$ somewhere else in the future.<//review>

<Text>Did not fix my problem of having the center console sticking i n Park.
I have ordered the parts my self and when they come in, I will find a service group that will take the time to open up the center console to actually troubleshoot the problem...  It could be solenoid or the cable which will allow the shift lever to be removed from park... I had the brake switch replaced for GQ...</Text>< Pictures>

<review>I didn't think car buying would be so easy! I'd been searching for weeks for a used Fiesta and they had exactly what I wanted and at a great price! Jim Wheeler was my salesman and he was absolutely amazing. He worked with me to get financing and to get the car in a timely manner--as well as made sure it had one quick repair before I picked it up. He took the time to show me all of the features in the car and was more than willing to answer any and all questions. Couldn't have asked for better service!

Thank you!!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I had a great experience buying a used car at this dealer that I was driving over 45 minutes to do my maintenance there. On November 11 however, they took almost 2 hours to have it ready. Finally Miguel told me that the car was ready but it was going to take 15 more minutes just to wash the car.
When I got my car I noticed the car hasn't been washed. I thought it was not a big deal so I left. When I got home I noticed there was a Crack on my winshield and the maintenance light was still turning on.
I contacted Miguel to tell him about this issue. I went back and he said all the mechanics were getting ready to go home. He tried to turn off the maintenance light but he didn't know how so he sent me to the Toyota dealer. About the Crack on the windshield he said that it was already there and it has been filled before. I knew there was no Crack before so he said they were going to fix it if it hasn't been filled.
I took the car to the Toyota dealer and a glass shop and both told me that the Crack was recent and it has not been filled. I contacted Miguel at the Ford Dealer. He started to make the arrangements to have the windshield replaced but it has been more than 3 weeks now and he only tells me that he is still working on it. I have not seen any paperwork or any indication that they are going to fix it. Once they fix it I will rewrite this review.</text>

<date>1499054174665< /date><rate>2</rate><text>I had a 1:15 appointment for an oil change and rear brake replacement. 3 hours later my car was returned with a broken door handle. When I protested and demanded that it be fixed, the service adviser told me that the mechanic said the door handle was broken when he got the car. I said there was nothing wrong with the car door when I first arrived. The service adviser asked me to return the following morning to have the door panel removed and to discuss the problem further.
The next morning I brought the car in. The inside door handle contains a plastic piece inside that broke. According to my research, it is a common problem. My issue was that TWO mechanics had the car and neither of them indicated there was any problem on the service order. Very odd. I agreed to pay for the replacement part--nearly $70 with tax-- and the labor charge was waived.
I was satisfied UNTIL I took my car to an independent mechanic to get an estimate on some maintenance work. The car was parked for over 30 minutes. When the mechanic popped the hood, we discovered the oil level in the car was a full quart and a half LOW. There are NO leaks. I also noticed all the corrosion on both battery posts. The Ford service order specifically stated that the battery posts had been cleaned.
I don't know what is going on with Ford service departments, but what if I had driven to Las Vegas or Palm Springs in this heat after the Ford oil change? If an insufficient amount of oil in the crankcase led to the engine burning out, I'm quite certain I would be told that the engine was burned out BEFORE I brought the car in to be serviced. And why would the mechanic say he cleaned the battery posts when he clearly didn't? A small detail, but it begs the question, what else didn't he do when he was servicing the car and repairing the brakes?
This is the 3rd Ford dealership I have come to for servicing my car, and I am afraid it is the last. I don't object to paying a fair price for honest work, but this is also the 3rd time this particular dealer service department has been deceptive with me. Sorry, third time is a charm.< /text>< pictures>

I've bought multiple cars from this location and have been completely satisfied with how helpful and friendly everyone is! They are always willing to talk to you and always put the customer first. I myself have owned a Previously Owned Ford Focus Hatchback which ran perfectly and saved my life in a car accident, in which I had to get my new car - a Previously Owned Ford Escape Hybrid which was amazingly priced and looked brand new! I had an issue with its battery and took it in immediately and the Service department was wonderful. They got me right in even though they were closing in 40 minutes and they got the battery replaced before I could even get back from getting In-N-Out (To Go) next door! Great experiences every time!< /text>

<text>Old Truck Smog Service.  Santa Margarita Ford has worked on my 1998 F150XLT Triton 4X4 since I purchased it in 2003 and even though it is not one of the new vehicles they still keep it in great shape.  I have always believed in TPM and don't mind servicing this classic twenty year old truck.  Some trucks deserve to be kept in good running shape when it has performed so well in the almost 200,000 miles traveled.

One of the best experiences buying a car at Santa Margarita Ford!  After online research and visiting a local dealership in Monrovia I found the car I wanted, but not the customer service. I was referred to Santa Margarita Ford.  I had a 5-10 minute conversation over the phone with Robin and it was a done deal!  Very professional and quick to get the deal done.  I drove from Pasadena to Santa Margarita and it was the best choice I have ever made.  When I arrived at the dealership, the car was parked out front and ready to drive off.  Between Charlie Pastick and John Hadden they had me off the lot quickly.  Even with a busy Sunday they were both able quick to answer any question we had and did it in a professional manner.

The dealership was very low pressure and more like a friend or family to help you make a wise choice on buying a car.  I will be back Santa Margarita Ford, especially if I can work with Robin, Charlie and John!</text>

We had a long time relationship with another dealership but our sales rep retired so we gave Santa Margarita Ford a chance to earn our business. We dealt with Tony Merten in the fleet department and he took care of us from our very first contact. We were provided with pricing and finance options with no hassle or pressure and we easily made a deal we were satisfied with. We had one minor issue after delivery and it was settled quickly and to our satisfaction by General Manager James Graham. Santa Margarita Ford and Tony Merten have earned our future business.</text>

Great car purchasing experience. I live in Indio and decided to take the 2 hour drive to Orange County to purchase a vehicle at Santa Margarita Ford. I called Charlie Pastick to inquire about a vehicle on their website and we were able to work out a deal over the phone. After looking a cars at dealerships in my area  I was unable to get the deal I was looking for. Charlie was able to give me a FANTASTIC deal on the car I  had been searching for. He was very pleasant , courteous  and knowledgeable. When I arrived at Santa Margarita Ford he had all the paperwork and car ready for me. I was in and out in no time !! I would highly recommend SM Ford and Charlie if you are looking to purchase a vehicle.  Next time I am in the market for a vehicle I will be purchasing it from them.

<Review>I just purchased a Ford F-250 truck from Santa Margarita Ford. The sales staff at the dealership were great. They made the process so easy. I first found the truck online. I emailed a request to find out if it was still available. Susan Grinnan, from online sales, responded within minutes with all the information on the truck.. I set up an appointment and Scott Delabar was waiting for me when I got there and he just made things very simple. The truck was out in the front and he explained everything about it. I recommend Santa Margarita Ford to anyone. The quality of their Customer Service is way above the expected average.< /Review><GmapID>0x80dcebae88c29fd3:0x94c20ab75bfc6b9< /GmapID>< Pics>

Robert scheduled us and took care of the intermittent warranty problem that had been going on for quite some time. Transmission hard shifting. Robert got us in and out as promised and had a good attitude.<//Text>

<review>I just purchased a Focus ST and the experience was great, from the scheduling of the test drive, to the final signing of the paperwork, and receipt of the keys.

Sales consultant, Charlie Pastick, was extremely helpful and friendly throughout the whole process of vehicle purchase.  Charlie and the sales team worked very hard to find and deliver a vehicle in my color and configuration preference.

Finance manager, John Hadden, completed the process by clearly and concisely explaining all the facets of the paperwork portion and making adjustments to sweeten the deal.

I found everyone, at Santa Margarita Ford, to be friendly and very accommodating to my needs as a customer looking for a new vehicle.  I would highly recommend this dealership, to anyone looking for a new Ford vehicle.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1456771242527, 'text': "We appreciate your feedback of our Staff's outstanding service, Adam!

Almost every time I've had to bring my car into the service center, I've immediately had problems with it out of the lot. I originally went in to have my car checked out after a long journey, as I did not want to find myself Found On Roadside Dead on the 5 or 405, and they performed an update and serviced my car. Next day, I found myself dead on the 405 and had to be towed, which I had to foot the bill despite the service being the cause of the transmission failing, as they did not perform the update correctly. They did replace for no cost, but it was more than a bit frustrating that the reason I came in was my worry of that happen, only to happen because the update was not done right by the servicing.

This trend would continue almost each visit I would make here. I would go to the shop, and then next day immediately have troubles with the car. Go to servicing to have it checked out and repaired, next day get notice it needs servicing, again, despite me going in to make sure everything was ok. Have to take my car in, turns out clutch needed to be replaced. After they completed it they pulled the car up, and while sitting in the servicing section with one of the servicing reps, and it made a loud, very very hard to ignore screech and clunk. You could see it in the rep's eyes that he was upset as well when it happen, knowing that I've had issues every time I came there.

Miguel has continued to provide good service as a rep reaching out, updating me, calling me to check up and make sure things are ok, but the actual mechanics and techs continue to provide poor service, letting not only me, but him and the team down over and over.<//Text>

After failing a smog check, my girlfriend, Jaclyn, and I went to Santa Margarita Ford, to secure parts for her 2003 Ford Escape.  We met with Hector of the Parts Department and showed him the smog check report.  He immediately knew what parts we needed and was, effectively, very helpful in contributing to a passing smog check.  Once again, we thank you so much for you help, Hector!< /Text>

Based on the great service of these two gentlemen, I'd definitely recommend this dealership to a friend.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< UserId.>

I love my C-Max Energi I bought at Santa Margarita Ford!  They are the greatest people to work with to get a great deal and I love my car!  Plus, the service was done well.  I just take my laptop with me and use their free wifi to work while I waited in their lounge.  Very easy.<//Review>

Just bought a Felix and had a great experience! They were willing to work with me to get a deal that worked. The Felix is in great condition and a certified pre-owned which gives me peace of mind. David Olender was patient with all my questions and followed up with my in a timely manner. He even followed up with me a couple times since my purchase to make sure we are happy! I think that is awesome customer service. Everyone there was kind and friendly and there was no pressure to take a deal that wouldn't work for me. I will definitely recommend my friends and family to purchase from Santa Margarita Ford.</text>

Peter Dore was awesome!  We ordered our truck and he kept us up to date on its progress and made sure we got exactly what we wanted. Costco pricing made us feel great about getting a fair deal, then Peter found us some additional savings!  We are very happy with Santa Margarita Ford and very fortunate to have Peter Dore as our salesperson.< /Review>

<text>I recently took my 2013 Ford Fusion to be serviced at the RSM Ford.  Peter was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.  The service was completed within a few hours of dropping it off.  Thanks so much for the quick, reliable, and friendly service RSM Ford.  I will continue to bring my Fusion to this location for all needed services.<//text>< GmapID>

<Text>I connected with the Santa Margarita Ford Internet Dept and asked them about the Ford Fusion Hybrid. I told Susan of the Internet Dept that I need to drive an hour to reach their dealership, and they should be honest about assessing trade-in value on my current vehicle.  Strangely when I got there, Susan never came out to greet me - I guessed too lazy to get off her chair to greet a customer who drove the distance to reach the dealership. As a contrast, at other Ford and Chevrolet dealerships, their internet manager/directors would personally come out to greet a customer just arriving -- I've been personally greeted by all the internet managers/directors at all the other Ford and Chevrolet dealerships.  I guessed customer satisfaction is not a motto at Santa Margarita Ford.   Instead, I was paired up with an older gentleman as my salesperson.  He was low-keyed and pretty easy to strike up a conversation.  This was a good salesperson.  We test drove a Fusion Hybrid that I picked out and everything went fine.  What went downhill is when they took my vehicle to their used car department for appraisal.  Since most customers carefully input the accessories and other stuff into the online Kelly Blue Book calculator and it would give you a printout of your trade-in value (within a tight range).  Armed with this Kelly Blue Book trade-in printout, I sat patiently for the trade-in assessment.  I was handed over to the sales manager for the trade-in negotiation and I knew this was going downhill fast.  The sales manager appraised my trade-in at almost over $4000 below the Kelly Blue Book trade-in value printout.  This is a total rip-off! And, the sales manager said that I would get similar low ball trade-in offer from other dealerships.  He said that I shouldn't trust the Kelly Blue Book trade-in value, and trust their used car department - Wow, I'm a professional and I don't need them to tell me this lie.  I WILL trust Kelly Blue Book and not trust their used car department.  With that, I left the dealership for a long drive home - wasted my time and fed a bunch of lies by the sales manager.  To prove Santa Margarita Ford wrong, I went to SouthBay Ford dealership (near LAX) and went through the selection of a new Ford Fusion Energi Plug-In and patiently waited for SouthBay Ford to assess the trade-in value of my vehicle.  Surprisingly, SouthBay Ford's assessment of my trade-in value matched the Kelly Blue Book trade-in printout that I was holding in my hand. This tells me that SouthBay Ford is truthful and transparent in its dealing with customers.  On the other hand, Santa Margarita Ford shouldn't be trusted by their customers.  Beware - you could lose thousands of dollars on your trade-in if you intend to purchase your next vehicle at Santa Margarita Ford.  If you don't believe, print out the Kelly Blue Book trade-in value from your home computer.  Take your trade-in vehicle to Santa Margarita Ford, and watch Santa Margarita miss your Kelly Blue Book trade-value by thousands of dollars.  If you still decide to go through with it, you just financed the ultimate Hawaii vacation for the Santa Margarita's sales manager, salesperson, and finance manager.  If it were me, I would rather take that Hawaii vacation myself instead of financing Hawaii vacations for others.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

He was extremely helpful, professional and very friendly. Made us feel welcomed once we arrived at the dealer. All dealers need more sales people like Mike :)))) There was no pressure on the sale and was very patient with us. We drove home the next day in our 2013 Hyundai Veloster and have no regrets :) Thanks to Mike, we have a peace of mind and enjoy our new ride !!!!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I was pleasantly surprised at the straightforward communication and offer they presented.

I came down to the dealership and was introduced to my salesman, Peter. No hidden tactics or trying to switch the deal. Very knowledgeable about the product.

The only negative experience I had was with the finance guy. Tried to sell me all the add-ons would push more than he should have.

Overall, I would go back and buy another car from here and specifically Peter.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dcebae88c29fd3:0x94c20ab75bfc6b9</GmapID></record>

<user_name>Liz Boulter< /user_name><Date>1419920029150< /Date><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>My husband and I had been to many dealerships looking for a car for me.  My son brought me to Ford and we test drove a Fusion with Charlie, he was great but the car was a little too much for me.  My husband brought me back to Ford a week or so later to take a look at the Focus and Blake Ruggles helped us out.  Blake was amazing as he put up with a million questions, lots of initial indecision on my part and a few visits to the dealership. He never made me feel pressured or rushed. After we decided the Focus was what we wanted, Blake was able to get the exact car I wanted.  Then of course came the dreaded Finance Dept., but I will say that John Hadden made the experience very easy and smooth.  John was very patient as he answered all my questions and we felt very satisfied with all of the financing details.  After the purchase of the Ford Focus Titanium, there were a few glitches that were unforeseeable, but Blake and John handled them and I felt they always had my best interest at heart.  We hadn't bought a new car in many years and this was truly a great experience!  I am a Rancho Santa Margarita resident and will definitely recommend this dealership to my friends and co-workers.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dcebae88c29fd3:0x94c20ab75bfc6b9</gmapID></record>

This is my 2nd time buying a vehicle from RSM Ford! You can always expect excellent service from the staff. Scott,  our original sales rep referred us to Mr. Roby Moore. Scott was very kind and reached out to me and my husband while we were walking around the lot. Unfortunately he could not attend to us tonight because he was off. We were not disappointed by Roby's service though. As picky as my husband and I are... lol... he still kept a professional and kind attitude. Turns out we had a lot in common! You will not disappointed by Robys service. Go to RSM Ford!</review>

NEVER EVER use this dealership!!!!!!   I had an appointment to get my car serviced and let them know I needed a loaner. I made the appointment at 7:30. They called me back and let me know the car rental place was not open till 8 so we changed the appt to 8. At 8 when I got there they realized the car rental place does not open until 9 so I had to sit at the dealership for an hour until the rental company opened. Then once I got to the rental place they told me that the car company did not make a reservation so I had to wait until a ford came in. I waited another hour and finally just called a friend to pick me up. This is the most disorganized place I have ever dealt with in my life!!  Horrible!!!!!!!!!< /Review>

This review is a little late cause life just got busy.
Drazen Canjuga was the sales person.
John Hadden handled my finance.
From the start to the end it was a great experience.  My wife and I walked onto the dealership thinking we would just be looking around to see what's new. Since my wife was 8 months pregnant we were thinking to upgrade my truck for safety reasons. We ended up trading in my truck and buying an F150. They gave us what we wanted for my old truck and gave us a great deal for the new truck. We were happy how we were treated from the sales to the finance. Definitely was the best experience with buying a new truck.< /Text>

Jason Saling and Kevin Galaviz were awesome. I received wonderful customer service and Kevin was really patient with me while I test drove each car I was interested in. I went with the practical choice of the Ford Fiesta which to my surprise had a sporty feel and smooth ride.

Update 8-31-17
I've had several services since my purchase and I have been very impressed with the service department. I've brought up a few things that concerned me and they have addressed and solved the issues to my satisfaction. What's more important is the small town feel you get when you bring your car in. They truly took care of me and my car. Thank you Miguel and Stephanie for your great customer service!

Great experience! And this is the first independent review after a history of buying three mercedes and a mini cooper. Drazen was our sales rep and he gets five stars all the way for knowledge of Ford products. I had so many changes and request but he was very patient. SM Ford has a lot of pride in their dealership and it showed during my car buying experience. John our finance manager was awesome and he wasn't some stiff pencil pusher in a cheap suit. He was upfront and honest. I got a great deal on my new Ford Mustang and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Now I have to deal with my lease end return of my Mercedes which won't be pleasant because I know they are going to beat me up on charges, however, I am glad not to give my business to Mercedes this time around. SM Ford totally earned my business. They do a stellar job representing RSM.<//review>

<Review>Nothing stellar. Just a routine oil change and recall repair. The only complaint is that EVERY time I take my car in for service, at least one of the valve caps on the tires is missing or lost. I noticed it today (Monday - service was last Thursday). What made it bad was that I had just replaced the missing caps a day before. Attention to little things makes a huge difference.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1407782210153, 'text': 'Henry, thanks for sharing your honest review.

We leased our new Ford Edge just a couple of weeks ago, and what a great experience!  Scott Delabar was such a pleasure to work with, we could not be happier!  John Hadden in financing also was terrific to work with, and we were through our process in a flash and we picked up our new car the next day after the perfect car with the options we wanted was sent to RSM from Ontario.
If you want a painless and great experience with your next car, look no further!<//review>

<Time>1358990972433<//Time><rate>5< /rate><Text>I brought in my car for a standard oil change and a recall issue.  I called ahead only an hour or so before going in.  It took a little bit to get someone's attention at first (though my car was only one of two cars in line to be serviced) to get help, but once I found someone it was very easy and pleasant.

I also mentioned about my Sync not functioning correctly and the alarm going off for no reason while driving and they said they would check it out.  They shuttled me to my house and later they also picked me up.  All the work was finished in one day.  They Re-programmed the navigation which turned out to be the problem for alarm system and everything else was good.  Only thing they forgot to do was the complimentary car wash, but a customer care lady who followed up with me with a phone call a few days later, said just to stop in and they would give me a car wash.  (with my busy schedule I probably won't have time to but it was kind of her to offer)  She was very kind on the phone and I appreciated the call.

Very good service and I would recommend this dealership to anyone. ;D</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Review>Took car in for 70M service.  Service was quick since I made an appt.  What I disliked was the recommended service to change the cabin air filter.  For an item that costs $25 in the parts department, I was quoted a price of $99.  That would mean for a 1/2 hour service it would cost $74 in labor charge.  I really don't appreciate being over charged.  Think I will look elsewhere for this service.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Used Car Sales customer service? I don't think I never received such ill treatment as I did by Santa Margarita Ford. Behind this was the Sales Manager. They would not listen to their non competitive pricing for a Silver 2011 Chevy Suburban LTZ with 47k miles (stock no 43410) priced at $39,950! I made reasonable offer and counter offer and they would not budge more than 500 dollars.

I was quite upset with the way I was handled by the Sales Manager. I felt insulted by his attitude. Not impressed at all by this individual and he should not deal with the public.

I purchased a newer exact vehicle 2013 Suburban LTZ (silver) for 33k. The car is 2 years newer 6 k cheaper and similar mileage and exact same options.

I dont recommend you buy a used car at this dealership. Shop around. In 18 hours, I saved $6,000 and got a 2 year newer vehicle.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1427214927613, 'text': 'Francois, it is our goal to provide a great experience to every single individual with whom we interact and we clearly failed to do that with you and we would like the opportunity to try and make this right.

<text>I just moved to the area so it was my first time visiting RSM Ford.  I came in for a routine oil change on my Edge.  I parked and walked into the service area where there were several men behind the desks.  I waited for a few minutes before someone said "we will be right with you".  I waited a few more minutes and another gentleman asked me if I was waiting for someone in particular.  I let him know that I was not waiting for anyone in particular but was there for a routine oil change and he told me that they would be right with me.  I was a littled bothered when a girl walked in at this point and was helped right away. I waited a few more minutes before being helped.  The gentleman who helped me was very friendly and helpful.  I would have rated my experience 5 stars if I did not have to wait so long to be helped.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcebae88c29fd3:0x94c20ab75bfc6b9<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rating>3< /rating><review>Customer service is always great and is somewhere between 4-5 stars.  The 3 star review is a result of an issue with my car not being fixed.  Despite my car lunging, surging and having a loss of power, I was told that it operated within Ford's specs.  This is the same issue I've had twice before and had the TCM replaced once.  I feel I'm going down the same road and am frustrated this transmission issue does not have a permanent fix.  The loss of power upon accelerating from a complete stop, especially when on an incline feels dangerous.  Ford extended the warranty, but I still have to deal with this issue again until this part fails again.  This is more of an issue with Ford, rather than the dealer.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1492108018543, 'text': 'Mr. Gilbert,\nThank you for taking the time to respond to our survey request.

<Text>This is like our 4th car that we bought from Santa Margarita Ford.  We pass other ford dealerships to come to this one. On Friday night we purchased my leased ford and also bought my husband a car. Our salesman was amazing he worked with us and was so friendly,  thanks David Olender.
Also the finance manager John Hadden was terrific,  he worked with us twice that night and explained everything clearly.
I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a wonderful deal on a ford.
We will be back in 3 years when it's time for my daughter to drive.
Thanks again Santa  Margarita Ford.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>I went to RSM Ford to have a battery replaced. My only gripe is, they told me it would take 90 minutes to do the job. Strange it would take that long to remove and install a battery, a job that would take me 15 minutes. It was even more strange since I made an appointment for them to do it first thing in the morning, but I thought 90 minutes isn’t too long, so I decided to stay and wait. Unfortunately instead of 90 minutes it took over three hours.
Kind of screwed up my only day off to run errands.</text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I've been a customer of this dealership for 6 years now and have purchased 2 vehicles. My dad, grandfather, and uncle all currently work or retired from Ford. Loved them until the most recent interaction. Came in to get my oil changed and to get my rear camera looked at because it was only working 50% of the time. We're going on a road trip for a week and I wanted to make sure the car was in good shape. Walked away paying almost $200 just for them to tell me that my camera needs to be replaced ($900) and the oil change. Two days later, I get a notification from my car that I have low oil pressure. I just got the oil changed so this shouldn't be happening. Spoke to a rep on the phone and he said it's a 5 minute fix. Came early in the morning to get the 5 minute fix done and sure enough they wanted to check it out to see what's going on. They had it for over 9 hours just to tell me that the oil pressure sensor needs to be changed and is going to cost me another $300. I called another mechanic that I've been to previously and without telling them how much I would get charged at the dealership, they were going to charge me $187. I called Ford and was thankful that they negotiated with me to match the quote. However, I can't help but believe that the previous service caused the reported damage the second go around. I didn't have time to argue about it and needed to just get it done to make sure my family is safe during our road trip. We left 2 days later and as I'm driving through Arizona I get an "Oil Change Required" light. I've had it. After several conversations and multiple trips to the dealership, this happens while I'm on the road. Granted the rep said that they did change my oil but forgot to reset the oil change meter. When I'm trusting you with my car and paying for peace of mind that the job got done correctly, it needs to be double checked especially if I've been to your business multiple times in one week. Sorry to say that I won't be getting my car service there any longer and will be purchasing my next car from a different dealership.< /text><response>None<//response><date>1499051178339<//date><Name>Allen and Valerie Neeley< /Name>< Rating>

I was looking for a specific model, the Ford Fusion, but I wasn't sure about engine size etc. I didn't want the hybrid so I test drove two cars and realized the 2.0L was what I needed. My experience with Ford RSM was solid. No big attempts to up sell me. They priced it well on the 1st pass and the finance guy offered his usual upgrades but not in a pushy way. I usually like getting an extended warranty anyway and I got a good price on that. My sales rep, Dakotah, was knowledgable and kept the process moving along at a reasonable pace.</Text>< Pictures>

If I could give them six stars, I would. We have purchased two cars from them in less than three months! Ryan and Scott are the best, and have gone out of their way to make these the best car buying experiences ever. We purchased a certified pre-owned Ford Focus and a certified pre-owned Ford Fiesta and they are like brand new! Plus, they went above and beyond at delivery to make it a very special day for my son. Shopping for and buying a new car can be a stressful experience, but everyone at Santa Margarita Ford instantly removed the stress. Plus, the prices are extremely competitive--we had done a lot of research and we could not have done better. If you're looking for a car, this is the place to go!<//Text>

<Review>Accompanied by my fiancé and his parents, I made my very first solo car purchase a few days ago and am so glad it happened at Santa Margarita Ford, and more specifically with David O. and John H., who made the whole experience so easy! I really never anticipated being so comfortable during a car buying process.

David was straight forward and matter of fact, but not aggressively so.   What's more is that he took the time to speak with me today when I called with some "ahhh this is my first huge purchase and I'm annoying!" questions.  He was very patient which I truly appreciated and this is just one reason of many why I feel confident with my purchase.

John in finance was also patient, and extremely helpful in breaking the numbers down for me and making everything crystal clear.

I know quite a few people looking to buy new cars, and I'm glad I can recommend this dealership based on such a great experience.< /Review>< resp>

My salespersonTom Glockner was awesome! Started with a phone call, told him what I was looking for, within 24 hours He called me back and said that he found the truck that I was looking for. He sent me pictures, we talked about everything over the phone. Once the paperwork was drawn up and ready to sign he called me and said come pick up truck. I pulled in the parking lot Rancho Santa Margarita Ford and couldn't believe it when I saw my truck (F150 301A) It was Beautiful. I spent about 45 minutes they're mostly talking to Tom telling him thank you. I sign the papers and went home. It was the best car buying experience I have ever experienced.
Thank you Tom.

<Text>Had problem with my FLEX's back liftgate. I was getting stuck half way up or down, then stayed open. A big security issue for us.
Took video on my cell to document problem, since many times the dealer has trouble with "reproducing the problem" when you take your car in to be fixed.
RSM Ford diagnosed and fixed the problem. So far, so good......
Miguel helped take care of it and found a solution to satisfy my concern.

The best car buying experience... ever. Having only dealt with Infiniti and Volvo dealers in the past, the team at RSM Ford were Amazing!
I love my Ford Fusion and working with Scott Delabar made the dreaded car buying experience truly wonderful. Dave Franco was also great.

<Text>I had noticed that my brakes were acting a bit strange over the past week and decided to take it in to be looked at. Santa Margarita Ford (SMF) was able to get me in right away on a busy Saturday morning. Upon examing the car, the technician discovered that the brake booster was actually a defective part. He replaced it at no charge and I was able to pick up my car the same day. It was fantastic. All of my interactions with SMF have been pleasant, positive, and stress-free. I think that is quite a feat to achieve for a car dealership. Kudos to the crew at SMF!!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I am very concerned about the latest refusal to perform a service that I requested. I bought a Dodge Ram 2010 1500 from Santa Margarita Ford about 8 months ago, and every time I bring it in for service, they refuse to work on anything unique to the Dodge, even though Santa Margarita Ford sold me an extended service warranty. The lastest one was a ticking sound that, upon doing some research, appears to be a known problem with exhaust manifold bolts breaking. SMF service manager gave me some evasive answer to my service request and told me I need to go to a Dodge service place. I found a Chrysler Tech Service Bulletin that sounds like the exact problem. I think SMF is trying to avoid standing behind the warranty they gave me. So I plan to read the fine print and possibly refer the matter to my attorney (my wife).<//Text>
<resp>{'time': 1468863647065, 'text': 'Mr. Rubens,\nFirst off, thank you for purchasing a vehicle from our Dealership. I have heard many good things about the Dodge trucks and their reliability. In regards to servicing your vehicle, the warranty you purchased (Portfolio) is a complete warranty. It comes with the coverage you need. Our technicians at Santa Margarita are primarily Ford technicians. They can perform basic repairs on other makes, fluid exchanges, brakes, alignments, etc. When it comes to noise concerns or more advanced diagnosis, we refer guests to a Certified Dealer. A Dodge Dealer will have access to all the latest and greatest information and repair procedures that are proprietary to Dodge. Once you take you vehicle to a Dodge Dealer, they will inspect it, call the Portfolio authorization and claim number, and then the repairs will be approved based on specific component coverage. We do business with the local Dodge Dealership in SJC, Courtesy Chrysler Dodge and Jeep. Bring a copy of your contract and they will make copies. If it is easier for you, drop the car to us and we can deliver it to the Dodge dealer on your behalf with your permission.\nIf you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nThank you,\nGina Allen\nDirector of Fixed Operations'}</resp><Rating>1<//Rating><username>Randy Rubens< /username>< pictures>

<Text>RSM Ford is the best dealer experience I have had in recent years. Since I bought my Ranger from them a few years ago, I had to move to Fullerton and Irvine being a bit too far (I thought) to go to RSM for servicing and repairs, so I tried McCoy Mills and Tuttle Click. McCoy Mills was a huge travesty and Tuttle Click proved to be another big mistake. Finally, I knew there was only one Ford dealer for me and that is RSM (despite the long drive). Also, you could not ask for a nicer more helpful and fair professional Service Advisor than Duane nor  a more pleasant closing out than from his beautiful Service Assistant, Bella. I highly recommend that if you have a Ford vehicle of any kind and no matter how far from you they are, that you make the trek to RSM Ford and utilize their services because they truly do understand the term, "Customer Service". Plus, if you are looking for a new car deal, it's their 20th Anniversary so they are really trying to give you a good price and you should take advantage of their celebration.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Today I purchased a used 2014 Kia Optima from Robbie Moore one of their sales people.  Really nice guy, no pressure in anyway and no b.s.  Charlie Pastick who finalized all the closing docs was really great and also a nice guy.  It was a good experience just dealing with what I would call normal people.  No high pressure and run around like some dealers, not to mention any names.

After driving home I noticed the license plate holder with the dealer name on bottom and top of the frame says "We Get It"!  They do.  After many of hours research on the internet looking for a decent used vehicle, I can honestly say Santa Margarita Ford has some of the best used car prices out there.  So bottom-line...I am a happy camper.  I would never hesitate to recommend anyone to this dealership.  Good job guys!</Text>

Disappointed with the sales team.  I was more educated on the available features of the Explorer Sport than they were.  Rushed out upon completing the purchase and not shown how to operate any of the functions of the car.  SYNC system is somewhat convoluted and apparently they are supposed to also make a return appointment to go over that feature in detail.  I'm very technical and have figured most of them out myself via the web and relative intuitiveness.  The gentleman in finance was the savior that salvaged the deal, the sales guys can thank him when they get their commission check.  Highly suggest better training and knowledge with the sales team.  When your business is selling a particular product and limited models with similar features, you better know it frontward and backward instead of sitting on the benches in front of the dealership BS'ing and drinking coffee.  I work for a company who's motto is Customer Happiness and I left RSM Ford feeling a bit empty on that front.</Review>

<Review>My Wife Donna hates car shopping. I literally have to have the car picked out and the deal done before she'll even set foot in the dealership.  Last week we needed to replace her tired Mazda SUV. The team at Santa Margarita Ford made it easy on me.
Sue Grinnan in internet sales found the right car, Peter Dore showed my wife all the features and advantages to her new (lightly used) Escape.
I brought my own financing so Dave Franco and John Hadden put the package together for me.

<text>Loyal F-150 buyer (3 in the last 12 years, from another dealer) bought my 4th from Santa Margarita Ford.  Almost says it all right there!
BUT, I want to give a shout out to the individuals who made it a GREAT experience:
#1 Sue Grinnan, their internet guru who responded quicker than immediately to a Costco car-finder inquiry.  Helpful, found out my car needs, responded with a few choices, and handed me off to a salesman;
#2 Charlie Pastick, professional, patient, personable.  Low key, clearly explained the options without the expected pressure sales pitch.  Found the right vehicle with the exact options requested.  Even drove out to the dealership that had the right car and brought it back, same day!  Above and beyond...
#3 John Hadden, dreaded "closer"...but not really!  Quick, efficient, giving a few financing options which can only be described as "better" and "best".  Offered a few enhancements to the deal, one of which I chose.  Again, low key, transparent with the numbers; allowed me to make my own choice.
I'll see you in 4 years guys!!<//text>< Name>

Robbie is the MAN!  I have bought many cars over my lifetime and sold cars for a spell.  Robbie and the Sales Managers at RSM Ford are hands down the best!

Not only did he put together an awesome deal we were in for the Test Drive, and out driving out new car heading to dinner in under 2 hours...  I am totally not kidding.  Under 2 hours...  I have never before bought a car in under 6 hours if I was lucky.  Look no further.  This is where you want to go to get the BEST DEAL with the BEST PEOPLE...  Tell Robbie I sent you.
Ken Burgwald - Titanium Energi Driver.... Oh Yea!!!!!!!</review>

I had an apointment at 7:15 AM, I came early and expected to get out early
since I had to wait for my car.  90 minutes later I finatly got my car back.
That is way to long for me.  When Peter Kobal was my Service Manager
It took no more than one hour or less and that included a car wash.
I dnot think I will be back to Ford for an Oil change.
There are maney for oil chnge in OC.  Trive Thru Oil Change promis a

Your arrival time with the transit was at 7:07 am and it was completed at 8:17 am for the “Works Package”. After speaking with Roger he did confirm that the vehicle was brought up not washed because you needed to get out fast. After you requested the wash we did go back and wash the exterior. It did take longer than normal due to the confusion. We apologize for this inconvenience and have noted in your file that the next “Work’s Package” is on us.

The experience dealing with salesman Mike Blumenthal and Finance manager John  Hadden has been the best and most efficient of any of the vehicles I have ever purchased or leased. The transaction took minutes from start to finish with no haggle . I have dealt with many less scrupulous car sales people recently  and I can certainly vouch for the professionalism, efficiency, honesty  and courtesy extended by Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Hadden . I had reached out to many  dealerships and only Mike Blumenthal responded and stood by his response throughout the experience. The total time spent  deciding on the vehicle and writing up the lease contract with John was less than 30 minutes which is unheard of but a fact .I have run a successful business for 26 years and highly recommend you call Mike Blumenthal  if you are interested in a Ford product and insist on having John Hadden do the paperwork. I also appreciated receiving a  personalized signed letter of appreciation from Santa Margarita Ford President Jim Graham. By the way the Ford plug-in hybrids are amazing hi-tech  vehicles and the fed and state rebates are excellent not to mention access to car pool lane as a single driver.< /Text>

<text>After having my tires consistently filled to the wrong pressure and my oil life never reset (little annoyances), I'd finally had it when I made an appointment to have my alignment done and a power steering line replaced and they didn't tell me until I came to pick it up that they couldn't align my vehicle and didn't have the line and couldn't get it.  I also gave the service rep a long explanation of a steering issue I've had where the vehicle will apply one of the brakes arbitrarily in a turn.  It's not my imagination as passengers feel it and ask what happened and the brake pedal depresses noticably when it happens.  It's a very dangerous condition that I assume has to do with a faulty traction control system.  They said they couldn't duplicate the problem.  Note to service tech from the rep was "check for dragging brake".  Sent me on my way with the dangerous condtion still in full effect.  Going elsewhere for repairs from now on.  I've never had an experience where they didn't do something wrong.< /text>< pictures>

when i drop off my explorer yesterday i told one of the guy from service regarding the noise i herard form the A/C and he told me that i will make sure that he check it out.I went back there to pick it up and i believe it wasn't
check because it wasn't  documented.he should put an extra note so the technician will know what to else he need to do beside the regular service.I do believe that if it's documented it means it was not done.period...< /text>

< Review>
This place socks bough my truck there and they sold me extended warranty that only let's me go back to their crudy stealer ship for warranty repairs.  Their techs could not fix the issue so what can you do.  Drive to a dealership 50 miles away and get the truck repaired.

The worst part of a all this is that the extended warranty through ford cost the same.< /Review>
