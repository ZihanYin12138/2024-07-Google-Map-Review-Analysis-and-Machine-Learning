I highly recommend Dr. Kamjoo for excellent care! He is definitely a 5 Star Doctor. Very intelligent, professional, experienced, spends quality time with you, great bedside manner and always goes the extra step because he cares for his patients as people not a number. Dr. Kamjoo has been a blessing in my cancer journey!</review>

Today was my first visit with Dr. Kamjoo and what an encounter that was. From the moment he walked in the room, he gave me his full attention! He was 100% focused on me, my history, my well-being, and what he could do to restore my health. He reassured me that the issue I thought I had was not a real concern but there was something going on that he wanted to work on. I am so happy with my new doctor!</Text>

Dr. Kamjoo is an incredibly dedicated doctor. His care was amazing and very through. He took on my case which was very complicated leaving no stone unturned was able to bring my body back into balance and good health. He is smart and caring and follows through until you are well.
You would be lucky to be in his care.</Review>

He maybe a good physician ... I won't know ... since he advertises non-existent appointments on ZocDoc. People book an appointment, only to have him call back and try to reschedule for a distant date. I understand when car salesmen do things like that. I can't believe that physicians fall that low as well.<//review>

Doctor Kamjoo is one of the most thorough, thoughtful and kind physicians I’ve ever met. He takes his time, gets to know you and takes your health as serious as he takes his own. My wife and I recently decided to participate in his concierge service and it’s been great. Same day appointments, immediate communication with the doctor himself and great care. I literally can’t recommend him any higher.< /Review>

First and foremost, my wife is a nurse practitioner, and insisted that I begin with Dr. Kamjoo many years ago. She lined me up with who she calls “The A Team”, with Dr. Kamjoo spearheading as my GP.

It’s impressive how Dr. Kamjoo recalls minute details about me from past visits without referring to “the chart”. I appreciate his detailed hands on approach, going through numbers and stats with me, telling me what normal ranges are, compared to where I am with current lab results. I could not recommend Dr. Kamjoo more highly.</Review>

I was referred to Dr. Kamjoo and I am really appreciative that I was. Came to see him because of my kidneys and to learn more about what is the matter and what I can expect from my future. I found the meeting to be enlightening and today I am starting things that I didn’t think of on my own. Highly recommend Dr. Kamjoo. He is a very special doctor who listens to everything said and even seemed to tune into just who I am. Really appreciated the time spent with him.</Review>

Dr. Kamjoo, the nurse practitioners, and his staff provide an excellent quality of care. They do a thorough and thoughtful review of your health history and really provide patients with the 1-on-1 interaction that seems to be lacking today with other health care practitioners. I’m grateful to have found doctors that care and take time with their patients.< /Review>

He was never in a rush and made sure we understood what was going on and the next steps. We had a follow up appointment in his office. The wait time was reasonable. We saw Kira, his Nurse Practitioner. Kira was lovely, very thorough and also made sure we understood where we were at and next steps.  We had the option to follow up with different specialist, who we had seen in the past, but have elected to continue care with Dr Kamjoo and Kira.<//Text>< Pics>

Dr kamjoo has been my doctor for a number of years. He is a very attentive doctor and he really listens. The only bad thing is he usually runs behind, only because he does not rush his patients he stays with you until he is satisfied he has heard all of your concerns. His office staff are the best, they take care of you when your in the office or if you call in with questions or request.<//review>

Dr. Kamjoo has been an outstanding doctor for me, caring, compassionate, understanding and most of all wants to get to the bottom of things and find out what's wrong.  I highly recommend him</review>

< Review>
The show we saw "White" was amazing, with a great set design and great cast. The show was biting, witty and made you think. There was a nice mini discussion with patrons after which I wish I had more of when going to shows.
Also nice little area for food/drinks with sweet staff.
Cute raffle that apparently happens with each show.
Check online for MAD and other pay-what-you-can offers if you need to be frugal.
💯👍🏾</Review>

Saw the play Arcadia. 'Twas a creative and clever performance across time. If you're one for philosophy and/or debate I would highly recommend going to watch.

The performance hall itself was fairly cozy. Seats were reasonably comfortable and positioned 360 degrees about the stage (but with most on a single side). Lighting was on point throughout the show, hats off to not only the actors but the directors and stage hands.</text>

Shotgun Players perform consistently above their weight class. Community theater that gives ACT, Berkeley Rep and the Curran a run for their money. (But check the others out too - the Bay is big enough for a lot of great acts)< /Text>

Shotgun Players offers an alternative approach, more focused on creativity and innovation, with a bit less focus on popular, commercial theatre.  I went to a reading of The Cherry Orchard recently, and have seen several other shows in the past.  Parking isn't always convenient, so consider taking the BART to get there.  They are just across the street from the Ashby station.</Text>

I've been wanting to see Arcadia for years, so I was grateful for the opportunity to see it here, and delighted by the incredible performance! They also have seating on the stage, which is a surprisingly intimate experience, and really brought the play to life. I would definitely attend another production by this company!</Review>

No bad seats.  If you live in the East bay I highly recommend getting some last minute seats from goldstar or todays tix and check this place out.    Some bad theater occasionally and a 50/50 chance you will love what you see here as it is with all small theater groups but they are really nice and I have seen some great stuff. Their production of Arcadia last season was excellent.< /review>

<review>Great local theater across the street form Ashby BART. I saw the troupe perform William S. Gibbons "The Black Rider", featuring music from Tom Waits. The band was exceptional; I'm a huge fan of mid-career Waits, and the band captured his junk-symphony vibe to a T. I'm not particularly knowledgeable about acting, so I can't comment on the skill of the actors, they clearly were having a good time performing the show (for what it's worth, I saw one of the last showings of an extended run, a time when I can easily see the actors tiring of their roles, but that was not noticeable with the Shotgun Players). I had a seat in the back corner, which wouldn't seem ideal (it was one of the last to go), but visibility and comfort we're not issues. There is a bar and you can enjoy your cocktail inside the theater. Recommended! I will be returning.</review>< pictures>

What?  You haven't been to Shotgun Players yet?  You've driven by, you've noticed the way they repaint the building for every show, kinda wondered about it, but you just weren't sure whether to swerve away from the standards like Berkeley Rep.  Go ahead and swerve, my friend - right into the BART parking lot across the street (or better yet, just take BART there), and you will treat yourself to some of the best theatre the Bay Area has to offer. This is intelligent, thought-provoking, talk about it afterward, wow, that was really something kind of an evening, with extraordinary actors - some you'll recognize, some up and coming.  Subscribe for a really good deal (check out the WOW deal), or the under 30's deal, or the nights that are pay what you wish, or check out their Champagne Reading Series - just $15 a pop.
We've subscribed for the past 5 years, but I grieve all the years before that I could have been here!  Don't make the same mistake, check it out!</Text>

<text>Great towing services! My husband and I had our truck car towed about 5 miles today. They got there in the estimated time I was given over the phone through AAA as they contract with AAA. Joselius and a coworker helped us out. I was really surprised how fast they got my car up towed to my mechanic. Very grateful for their services. Highly recommended. Thank you!<//text>< name>

I know its not their fault that they took my car and ended up with it but like all platinum towing yards they dont know how to do their yard and break cars. Rude service because they were not getting paid and still had to release my car. Disappointed but pist about them damaging my car. They broke off the front emblem while jumpstarting my car.< /text>

Scott W.  was a great help and explained what was going on and why it was happening. Which was very appreciated especially Because I’ve had other times /people just state that the battery is dead and it needs to be replaced and that was that. No explaining or anything making me feel like they were just trying to get money out me. Well that was absolutely not the case with Scott W. His explanation and visually showing me the problem made me feel very comfortable with paying for a new battery. I would recommend Oxnard Tow Services to anyone who need battery services and I’m sure they are just as professional with their towing services as well.<//text>

Scott was very professional.   He's punctual and very knowledgeable.  He explained why my car wouldn't start.   Also explained in detail the difference between gel battery and regular battery.   He knew right away where to look for the battery on my Mercedes which was not in the front hood of my car. It was indeed inside my vehicle under passenger seat which i didn't know.  Politely gave me the report on my old battery.   This man is great and one of the greatest I had ever dealt with from your company.   Thank you.</review>

Extremely professional at all times. Punctuality was on point!
Scott explained every component what he was doing. Answering every question with no hesitation, or doubt.
Customer service, and the knowledge of explanations were outstanding.
The quality, value, and professionalism, only allowed me to press good. I put all 3 extremely outstanding!<//text>

My car battery was dead and the whole process of trying to charge my battery and then replacing it with a new one took 20 minutes or less! Scott was friendly and efficient, I am very satisfied with my experience.

Also I was told that someone would be able to see me in an hour but it only took 15 minutes before Scott called and said he was on his way. Very cool!</text>< pics>

<Text>Scott let me know exactly what he was going to do to make sure all bases were covered.  He tested both my battery and alternator.  The latter was good, the battery was right on the edge, so, he gave me the pros & cons of whether or not to buy a new battery.  Really appreciated all the time he took to make sure
I got the best service possible for the long term.  I’m now a happy camper with a new battery.<//Text>< response>

My battery was not starting my car any longer, and when I called AAA, Scott saved the day. He tested it and I purchased a new battery through him. Had a nice chat about music while he was working, a really nice guy. Everything worked out great!</review>

Car would not start in Costco parking lot.  Called AAA and was told about 45 minutes.  Brian called 15 minutes later and said he would be there in 15 minutes and was right on time.  Quickly diagnosed the battery issue and had a replacement on his truck.  Removed and replaced and had me on my way quicker than I ever expected.  Really appreciated the punctual calls and arrival.  Also liked how Brian reviewed the battery tester print out with me so that I was confident it was time to replace.  Great job. Thanks!</review>

On my way to work noticed I had a flat tire so I called AAA and they told me I would have somebody within 50 minutes or less. To my surprise the tow truck driver showed up in about 15 minutes and was very nice Scott did an excellent job and made sure that our safety was number one before he changed the tire. Was very courteous and very respectful. Thanks for doing a great job Scott I truly appreciate it.< /text>

I was in need of battery service so I called AAA and they sent Scott who arrived very quickly. He was very much professional and caring about my problem.  He replaced my old batter with a new one right on the spot. I highly recommend Scott with Oxnard Towing Service.< /Review>

I know its not their fault that they took my car and ended up with it but like all platinum towing yards they dont know how to do their yard and break cars. Rude service because they were not getting paid and still had to release my car. Disappointed but pist about them damaging my car. They broke off the front emblem while jumpstarting my car.</Review>

Brian called to verify my address & arrived at my house in 15 min (that's unheard of).  Brian attached a meter to my battery & assessed the battery was fine.  There didn't appear to be much corrosion on the outside so Brian removed the cables from the battery & cleaned the posts & cables...and voila!  My car started right away.  Brian was not only expeditious & saved me a ton of $$, he was so personable :-)  It's nice to know I now have someone I can count on when my I can't count on my car.   I will recommend Brian to all my family & friends!

Thank you & Merry Christmas Brian!

I called AAA for roadside assistance and they dispatched Oxnard Towing. They gave me a wait time of one hour. Then I waited one hour and called back and asked. They said that Oxnard Towing was busy and extended my wait another hour. All I needed was a jump start. So I cancelled my roadside assistance call and asked a friendly person for a jump start. I don't recommend Oxnard Towing for any service and AAA should use it reliable towing service for their customers.
I'm adding this comment to my review on 2/27/2020, because I noticed that after the horrible service that I experienced, I saw only 5 star reviews. This to me is suspicious. I believe employees are reviewing their own business instead of having honest customer reviews. Before my review there was no reviews. Maybe this business started to provide better service since my poor review.< /review>

Saved me a trip to the dealer which I thought was necessary and some $$ to boot.

<text>These people are a bunch of crooks!!!!! The fees they charge are ridiculous!! They obviously set the prices to recover your vehicle so high, with the hopes that you will not be able to afford it so they can sell your vehicle and make way more money. I only gave them a 1 out of 5 stars so I could comment. Otherwise it would have been a 0 out of 5. They should be ashamed of themselves!<//text>< user_name>

Scott was prompt, eyed the problem and attempted to  resolve the problem. My car wouldn’t start, no sound , wouldn’t turn over. He checked the battery, which was good. I mentioned a new starter, so Scott thought it might be the wiring. He did start the car and I left to go to a repair shop.
Thank you Scott.</text>

After leaving work Friday evening in the pouring rain , my axle snapped on Rose and 5th.   Thinking my transmission was the culprit, I called Triple A  for a tow truck Julio was there in 17 min.  He threw my Chevy HHR up on the flatbed had us home in Ventura Quick!    Super service, the real deal!<//text>

<Text>Just like the last guy said not their fault the cars get towed. It’s their job but at least have some compassion for the rest of us that have know idea about why our rolling investments has been towed. The receptionist guy was rude and acted like a debt collector. Bro relax it’s just a job and please act like it’s your first day on the job and show some respect. One star all day.</Text>< userid>

Calvin Klein outlets sell the same in-season clothes for a third of the price. I have purchased shirts at the outlet and seen them the same day at Macy's at full price.  Great quality clothes, purses, belts, and undergarments.  The staff is always friendly and the stores are usually well organized and clean.  Also preferred program gives great deals, discounts, and rewards coupons. Thank you!< /text>

<text>Could have given a five star for the number of merchandise they have. But the customer service i got from a guy whose eyebrows are more perfectly done than my sisters was the worse.

I'd have to admit despite the outlet center not having s lot of good deals, this place had them. I'd still prefer online shopping but if you like the store experience, this is the spot!<//Review>

<text>Great place to go to look for motorcycle parts.
They have the most used parts I have ever seen in one place..tanxs/fenders/ handle bars/head lights.
Unless you go there..you can not imagine how many different motorcycle parts they have.
And at good prices also.
Very friendly/ helpful.
I really recommend you stop in if you need anything or if you just want sum good conversation..
Or..!!!!! If you just want to look.
And go..wow.!!!..<//text>< Pics>

<Text>I've known Bob for years.  He's really expanded, I couldn't be happier for him.  They give you a great price, treat you like family...customer service can't be found better anywhere in the area.
Got a Harley go to Road Dog, got a roadster, go to Road Dog, need tires n a great deal, go to Road Dog.  Say hi to Bob for me 😁😷< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
i just wanted to reiterate that Road Dog Cycle has always been a fantastic shop to me, and my bike concerns on a regular. I was a one time owner of that beautiful 96 Purple Dyna Wideglide pictured in several pics. Bob sold me that bike a while back and gave a great deal as well as any service needed to make sure i was completely satisfied.. in addition, I would greatly purchase, or suggest buying a bike to my friends anytime from Road Dog Cycle.. Not to mention, Bob and Joey are a couple of stand up guys, and make sure your services are handled as well as going the extra to meet whatever your bike needs.. Keep On Keeping On Road Dog !!!< /Review>

This place is awesome for the little ones to get tired for a while.  Since they opened, we still wear mask but it's all sanitized. Kids had a great time.<//Review>

I'm giving this a 5 star because my 6 year old had a blast. Non-stop running from trampolines to the swing to the foam pit.
I would rate it a little less but I don't think this place is really meant for parents as much.</review>

VERY disappointed in today's experience. Was here last week and had a wonderful time. Today the lady at the front was not very accommodating due to her shift just ending right when we got here and she was busy counting the drawer even though there was no one else even around...Then we were told AFTER I had paid that the kids had to jump WITH their masks on!! We were just here last week and did not have to. Yes we got demoted to the purple tier but that goes into effect on Saturday.  Today is Thursday. Really??? And yet we still we complied. But when the kids (4 of them) were thirsty and I went to buy them water THEY HAD NONE!! No water, made them wear masks while jumping, and only sold soft drinks??? Seriously?? What a HUGE waste of money. So disappointing.< /review>

Girl in the front gave a negative attitude to my family. Unfortunately couldn't get her name.poor customer service. Definitely shouldn't be in the front to greet paying customers didn't help with the waiver when we had tried it two times already. Besides that my son had a blast jumping and running around</Review>

This place could be so good!  I’d give it 2 stars if it wasn’t so cheap!
$10 for 2 hours is great.

Here why I won’t be back till my kids are taller.

4 and 6 year old boys- very agile very good on a trampoline- both just under the 46” threshold.

They can’t use the main area, they get to hang out in the small area with all the little little kids and babies...

Nothing they love more than hanging out with screaming babies and 2-3 year olds.
They have energy they can’t use here, they came to a trampoline park to jump and they get access to a baby area , dodgeball area foam pits and ladder crawl.

Change the rules or change the design and setup, because you are truly missing the mark on a huge age group.

So I do not recommend this place if your kids are not 46”

Based on the reviews I see this is an issue for so many people.

We frequent sky zone in San Marcos , almost every weekend and would come here if they would figure it out.

Sky zone has bigger areas and way more access for all kids.<//review>

We've had good experiences here in the 3 previous times we went here. Today we had my 5 year old twins' birthday party at Get Air. Nicole, at the front desk, said the smaller kids could jump in the big area unless it got too busy, which has been standard in our experience.

But then I met Evan who told me in an incredibly condescending manner, that the smaller kids would not be allowed to jump in the big area at all, regardless of how busy it was. I pointed out that there were 6.kids jumping at that moment plus my two, but Evan insisted that 6 kids constituted "busy" and ushered my kids to the small area. I told him that it was ridiculous that my kids, who were part of an expensive party, could not jump. He then told me that if I were to continue to argue with him he would write an incident report. What?!? He explained that he was in charge and it was too bad if I didn't like his decision.

I ended up speaking with Gavin, who was also on the floor. He was at that point unaware of my conversation with Evan. He said as long as it wasn't busy, there weren't a lot of bigger kids jumping, and he was comfortable with the safety of my kids they could stay in the big area. He was very friendly.

My kids spent the next hour and a half jumping in the big area. Gavin was incredibly friendly. Nicole was the hostess for the party and was great with the kids. Gavin and Nicole helped make it a nice day for my kids and their friends.

Evan, on the other hand, seemed to spend a lot of time staring at me. Several times he winked at me. From my perspective, this was simply antagonizing and certainly inappropriate I'm addition to the threat of an "incident report". I cannot understand how someone who acts like Evan did would or should be employed in a place where kids visit.

Overall, I would recommend having a birthday party at Get Air. But I hope that the management takes a look at how Evan acts.<//Text>

<review>I see a lot of negative reviews here, so I'm sure there is something to them. But my visit was great. I liked how they had clear boundaries between the different areas, and there are a lot of different obstacles to choose from. Staff were friendly and watchful, but not overly zealous about enforcing the rules. I recommend it.< /review><Resp>{'time': 1513720241085, 'text': 'Hi Justin, thank you for taking the time to leave us a review on your experience at Get Air Vista!

Seriously EVERYONE here at the time are young kids that are to small for open air and they can't use common sense and make the call to allow the kids in the open air area. All the parents want to do is play with our kids and there is no danger of us using that area at this time. I'd rather them just kick us out of the area when big kids show up and want to use the area. As of now our kids are attracted to the area. Let us play because we pay. I won't be coming back< /review>

< Review>
Get Air is amazing I love it so much. It is much better than SkyZone! I am really good at the dodge ball and I love doing flips on the trampolines.

By the way I Swear that this isn't a fake review I personally love it.<//Review>

<user_name>Shawna Haider< /user_name><pics>None< /pics><text>Terrible Terrible Terrible!!! I tried to plan my son's 5th birthday party here and what a disaster. I called Sunday to book the party and they took my credit card and didn't give me much info but said that the information I needed would be in a confirmation email. Right after I hung up the phone I got the email which said I had booked a "Small Air party". I immediately called them back to ask what "Small Air" meant. Then they informed me that my son and his friends would have to stay in the small sectioned off area for the entire party. I told him that he should of explained that to me when I booked the party 10 minutes ago, he said that it was too late and I was going to loose my deposit if I cancelled. It was literally 10 minutes ago that I gave him my credit card number and he still wouldn't cancel the party even though I wasn't informed of where the party would be held at or any of these rules. I've now called back at least 5 times to speak to a manager and no one will return my calls. Its been 4 days and I'm having to call my credit card and do a charge back. I've had such terrible customer service at this place and I would never recommend anyone hosting a party here!<//text><gmapID>0x80dc74e56c6fc301:0x332c29f6f6815dbf<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Holy moly we have been to a lot of trampoline parks but this one takes the cake as the dirtiest one we have seen. We visited Get Air on a Sunday afternoon 6/11/17 the place is ran by a bunch of teens. There was trash everywhere in the park trampoline were nasty. Bathrooms were disgusting every trash can was over flowing with bottles and food. There is no supervision one employee in the trampoline section.  He Could care less about his job. I would not return to this trampoline park again if I was in Carlsbad.  Unsanitary! Will not return<//Text>

<Text>This place sucks their is a worker named Bella and you can notice her because she is wearing white vans and black jeans with some  ratchet makeup and hair she kicked us out for playing  dodgeball and she called us 3 year olds when we are actually 14 and 15 so you should never ever ever ever come here unless Bella is not here or FIRED . She is one of the meanest worker here because she saw a little 4 year old get hit in the face with a dodge ball and stared at him while he was in tears so me and my friend had to take care of him Also she thought we were saying bad things in sign language about her behind her back so she told her manager of life that we did and ruin my friends birthday because of l also she thought we were saying bad things in sign language about her behind her back so she told her manager all lies that we did and ruin my friend’s birthday because of lies</Text>< Pics>

<Text>It was my first time at Get Air. It was a really small place and really used up. The soft blocks were really used up as well.
The front desk employees had no personality.
I really recommend The Skyzone in San Marcos.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dc74e56c6fc301:0x332c29f6f6815dbf</GmapID></record>

<text>Disgusting bathrooms. I cannot fathom how incompetent these young workers are. And the manager just stands by on his phone and avoids all contact with costumers to let the workers pick up the slack. pathetic excuse for a manager.< /text>< Rate>

Currently sitting in this establishment and there is not one single person on the trampolines but they are forcing my 5 year old to stay in the "toddler" area. There is not one person in the dodgeball area, top trampolines with foam pits, or in the big open trampoline area, but there are 10 children plus their parents crowded into the tiny gated toddler area. It's absolutely ridiculous that we pay $9 per child and are forced to stay in a tiny little corner of this place. I can understand wanting children 1-2 years old to stay in a gated area away from bigger kids(that's why it's called a TODDLER area) but a 5 year old?! It's way more dangerous for my 5 year old to be jumping next to a one year old. Any injury that could happen to my child on the big trampolines could also happen in the toddler area...that's why we signed a waiver!! Not worth the money in my opinion.< /text>

<Text>Today I went to Get Air with some other moms and our kids. I had my two kids and my daughters friend.
My son who is 5 wanted to play on all the areas. Immediately upon walking in we were told that he was not allowed to play in that area. I took him over to what they call the toddler area and it was filled with 1 and 2 year olds. My son said, no way mom. I then showed him the foam pit areas and he was good with that for awhile. Then other kids that were in our group who are the same age as my son were in the big trampoline area most of the time so I assumed he was fine too. He continued to move around the place like all kids do and an hour or so later I was right in front of him in the trampoline area and the employee came up to me very rudely and said, who’s watching him. I replied that I was. He continued to tell me that I need to watch my kids and he needed to be in the toddler area. I let him know that he was 5 and not a toddler. Meanwhile my friends kids who were his same age and younger were running around on the large trampoline area and nothing was said to them. After that I told my son to go back to the foam pit area. He jumped in the pit and took a little bit of time to get out. The same kid came running over to me in a rage to tell me that I wasn’t watching him and that I needed to stand right next to him. I was there with two other kids and was standing in a central location so I could see them all. As well, When my mom friends and I take our kids places we work as a team and keep an eye on all the kids because the kids mix up and play in different groups. He then informed me that he had spoke to his manager about me and was going to have me thrown out.
I went downstairs to speak with the manager and he said, “oh he told me about you”. The manager was just as unprofessional and rude as the other employee. My friends and I could not figure out why he picked me out of the crowd and was shamming me. This is the same kid worker that friended my friend on facebook the last time she was there.
I really wanted to love this place and was excited for another place to take my kids but it was a huge disappointment.</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Review>Wow, just wow. If you’re trying to get anything related to taxes done here, avoid Ahn Nguyen at all costs. My boyfriend had a phone appointment scheduled that she was 10 minutes late to, which ordinarily is no problem at all except she clearly was doing anything she could to get my boyfriend off the phone immediately. First she accused him repeatedly of uploading the documents wrong in the portal, which he hadn’t - she ended up poorly cupping the phone to ask a colleague for help who pointed out to her (confirming we hadn’t done anything wrong!) that she was trying to pull the documents incorrectly - then he asked her if she was coming to lunch with him and she rudely sighed and said ugh just give me 15 minutes ughhh and returned to the phone call with my boyfriend, unaware that we’d heard the whole exchange... she then proceeded to not even try and hide her annoyance for every question we asked, getting more and more aggressive as the call went on. My bf asked if he should file and amended return and she brusquely replied with “well if you want to, how should I know, I didn’t file your original return” - he also asked why H&R Block is attempting to collect federal tax for a random tax year from a few years ago, she said “I don’t know, I just hope you paid it!!!” And when he asked again for clarification she just doubled down on “well I hope you paid it if you owe it, is that all?” At that point my bf was done trying to get any real help from her, so he agreed to end the call. Basically, we barely got answers to any of our questions and my bf was treated as a nuisance by someone who preferred to just go to lunch and not do her job. No thanks, H&R Block, 0/10<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<text>The absolute worst service ever. Still waiting for my refund. I've been in contact with Lisa (who actually filed my taxes) and Ted (who apparently is the manager). They've stopped responding. No one wants to take ownership, I guess I should have paid them from the return itself - maybe that would give them SOME incentive to actually work....< /text>< pictures>

I've been living her for 4 months, this is our second spot in OC and I love living here. Other residents are friendly and respectful. The location is beautiful, peaceful and well maintained. It's out of the hustle and bustle of Irvine major areas, however has great running and bike tracks around.<//review>

Update: The maintenance crew hands down is awesome. whenever you have any issues they are on it. I have been here since day one when they open the apartments. You have few hiccups but other than that the place is really great place to live, great amenities and close to lots of trails. My overall experience with this place is amazing.< /text>

Pros: maintenance staff is very responsive and professional. Nice pool and common areas, fairly quiet. Good to have a garage.
Cons: expensive, and don’t discount the additional costs like $60 -$70 a month for trash and sewer this is 3x what I paid in my house. Parking can be a challenge.</Text>< Pics>

My girlfriend and I have lived at Portola Court for a little over a year now and love it! We love it so much we decided to transfer to a larger floor plan and commit to another year. The community is very quiet and well built. I am a heavy walker, and as far as I know have never had it be an issue for anyone below us. We also never hear any of our neighbors. As far as apartments go, this is pretty rare. At most communities you can hear your neighbors thumping around. We also appreciate that some of the three story buildings have elevators, which many communities reserve for the 4 story+ buildings, and that each home comes with a detached garage (built in shelving included).

Donald the community manager, and Sean the assistant manager have made our transfer process painless. They have both truly gone above and beyond to ensure we will be happy in our new home. I can be a pain in the butt sometimes, but they have never let their service falter. It is obvious that they both care about the happiness of their residents and take pride in their community.

We are looking forward to another year here, and would highly recommend anyone looking for a quiet community away from the bustle of the Spectrum area to check out Portola Court.<//text>

<review>Best apartment in Irvine. I lived here for a year and this apartment was perfect for my family. It is very quiet and well-managed. We had to leave because we had to move to different state but I really wish I could live here longer. The building is very new and clean. I think this apartment is one of very few complexes with elevator. The maintenance was always fast and professional. I would go back to this apartment if I ever go back to Irvine.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1596588409834, 'text': 'We appreciate your feedback for our community Hye Yoon!

I lived at Portola Court for 2 years and it really, truly was an AMAZING experience!

PROS:
- The real value of this complex comes with the staff. Portola Court team members are always quick to wave hello and make you feel so welcome. Specifically, my experience with Donald, Lisa, Lindsey Gardner Leasing is the reason I'm motivated to write this review. My roommate and I were out of state, with no plans on returning, by the time we realized we failed to return the WiFi modem to our provider. Donald offered to have his team mail the modem back on our behalf. WOAH!! From someone who works in customer service (and as such has possibly unrealistic expectations) this was above and beyond anything I would have ever expected. Irvine Company has a true winner with Donald. He is such an asset to the company!
- The property grounds and facilities (pool, fitness center, clubhouse, etc.) are so well maintained that each day felt like a vacation.
- DOG OWNERS: There are sidewalks and unique walking trails for miles around the community, so the area was a dream for me as a dog mom....especially when COVID added a lot more walk time to my previously busy schedule. It's a great area for furry loved ones!
- The apartments themselves are wonderful. I was happy to see each feature large windows, but my favorite aspect is definitely the terrace. I could have spent all day and night out there soaking in the fresh CA air. Such a delight!  Monica is amazing and fantastic< /Review>

<review>Donald Warren, a man who especially during this pandemic not only helped but accommodated for my difficult circumstances. The patience, consideration and humbling personality he possesses truly makes one feel welcomed. When the first round of people getting laid off from work hit, he was there right away to help, his communication and listening skills go beyond expectations. In difficult situations he is very effective in making timely and practical decisions while communicating the expectations to his team members. Truly grateful for him and everything he’s been able to help with. Still not in the best circumstances but Donald makes the best out of it. Thank you!!

Having lived at a few other Irvine Co. properties, the Portola property is by far the most outstanding. The level of cleanliness maintained is what sets it apart from others. Not only that but the staff, location, amenities and the people make living here very enjoyable. Furthermore, the Porter team, that being Kency, Harvey and Jordan, have been great and very responsive. Going beyond their duties In response to Covid-19 they have continued to work hard at keeping our property clean. The grounds and cleanliness of our community have been terrific, I am thankful for this team who gets the job done day in and day out.< /review><UserId.>115657510166650963654< /UserId.><Gmap_id>0x80dcdd4555555537:0x2615158f84dee1a4< /Gmap_id>< Time>

Horrible property manager, speaking without facts in front of their hands. very misleading and the environment has horrible Ant issue that they can never solve. Just keep in mind you may have to enjoy breakfast/lunch/dinner with ants around your table. I guess if you don't mind it then this is a good apartment for you. For those who mind, turn around and find elsewhere. I personally wouldn't get on and spend this extra effort on writing the review, but the customer service experience is just the worst in my 13 years of apartment rental. Stay away from Irvine company if you can.</Text>

<review>Great complex to live in! Quiet neighbors and neighborhood. Great amenities that are never busy, even when open in prime, non covid time. The only bad thing are the birds on the 'back/right side' of the complex! I would recommend living as close to the leasing office as possible. Maintenance is great and so is the leasing office staff. oh and ants....they are so annoying in the summer! but i think all of Irvine was built on a giant ant hill, so it isnt their fault.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Lindsey Gardner was our leasing agent. From day 1 she was patient with us, accommodating our needs that were unusual. She helped with a roommate swap to be sure it went well and was drama free. Overall we enjoyed living at portola court and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to live. This is a review from 1 year into lease.< /review>

Shoutout to Sean Boswell, who is really amazing in handling all situations and such a nice guy!! He's the best. The whole team rocks. If we ever want to go back we will! This is the best apartment complex in all of Irvine. I have visited so many of them and I am really picky. I really love it here. This is one of the only few Irvine complexes that have elevators, which is important for everyday living. The place is so nice, modern and clean. There are 2 salt-water pools, 1 yoga studio, 1 gym, a really large clubhouse, 1 wifi room, a parcel post room for large packages. It's a brand new complex and the landscape is nice. It's a very light and bright type of place. It is also really quiet since its in the new part of Irvine, so no traffic noise which is amazing. Also everyone who works here is really nice and helpful!<//Text>

I've been a resident of Portola Court for two years, and it has been such a great experience!

During our inital search, Lindsay our leasing rep, provided such a seamless experience. She matched us with an ideal floor plan in a perfect location, checking everything off the list that we were looking for. She was professional and relatable and made us feel like we were already home!

While the Resident Services team has evolved over the years, Justin has consistently been my go-to problem solver! From random inquiries, to helping me sort Parcel Pending and annual maintenance questions, he has always delivered solid customer service, time and again. Donald and Sean have also offered their help and I am so grateful to live in a community with such a 5-star team.

Maintenace needs have been few and far between, but any time I have needed something they have shown up  in a snap with a smile on their face. They really do keep the community in great shape, inside and out!

From the beautiful grounds, occasional food trucks, awesome amenities and stellar team, I am so happy to have called Portola Court home for the past two years!<//Text>

I've been a resident of Portola Court since August 2016 and have thoroughly enjoyed my residency.  I was one of the first people to move in and it is amazing how fast the trees and landscaping have matured since that time.  From my living room window I look directly at tall, thick pine trees and a perimeter water covered in foliage.  I love returning to the complex each day; at night there is such a great sense of arrival.  The trees line the main entry-way have flood lights that make the trees look so majestic and beautiful.  The common areas like the two pools, BBQ Gazebo, Car Wash, Business Center and Clubhouse are first class, extremely nice and well done.  Like everywhere, there are challenges that staff has to deal with, like residents who abuse the parking rules, but in general, I love living here.  The Irvine Company is amazing at designing and operating first class apartment living.< /review>

<Review>I've had pleasure working with "Ceyda Tahincioglu" to find a proper apartment and move out from my current one where I had some noice issues with my upper floor neighbor.
Ceyda was patient and showed me all available units. She was knowledgeable, thoughtful and hard working. She was very detail oriented and gave great advice. My moving went smoothly. She was great to work with.
Most important to me, Ceyda was always honest with me about cons and pros of each apartment. She was always available and helpful and I always felt that she truly had my best interests at heart.
In future, if I ever decide to move, I will definitely contact Ceyda again. She's the BEST !< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Text>I have lived here for a year, or so.
And overall, it’s amazing~

However, today, we had to change the air condition filter thing, and the paper said the time was between 9:00 A.M. - 5:00 P.M.

What if a person has kids, and she/he has an appointment? (It said only +18 can stay alone)
I think the time should be more specific.

“9:00 A.M. - 5:00 P.M.”?
What is that supposed to mean?
Anyways, there are some flaws,
But Portola Court Apartment is great!<//Text>< pictures>

Dogs are super loud all hours of the day and night, people bang on your door for no reason and some aggressive drivers for an apartment complex lot. First two months the brand new apartment was full of ants and crickets. Overall staff are nice but I get the feeling we could have done better elsewhere.<//review>

<Review>Went to see about a Dyson vacuum cleaner from a person who lived here. It took me 15 minutes from the time I pulled into the place to locate the person's apartment. The way the numbers fall don't lend to intuition.

I will say that the place looked clean, almost clinical but it's new so I imagine after people move in it will warm up a bit.

I viewed work out facilities, pool, and BBQ grills for common areas while I waited for my contact to show up. All in all I think it's much like the other places going up around Irvine except with a slightly fresher setup and appeal.</Review>< Resp>

<date>1544941183289< /date><review>Don't live here! New office staff is rude and unhelpful. The apartments were built in such a  rush there are holes under cabinets and measurements still on the wall. We have a roach infestation for 2 years now from the water lines, office has done nothing to resolve.  Also brand new neighbors are extremely loud, office representatives came in listened, said they would address it, later on just said they couldn't do anything about it unless it was late nights then to just call a patrol car. Awful and useless, would have moved out but unfortunately I have had pregnancy complications that kept me from finding a new place.  New people are moving in, extremely ghetto, and always loud music playing at the pool. Zero stars is what it deserves, DO NOT LIVE HERE, EVERYONE DECENT MOVES OUT!</review>< userid>

<Review>I am a resident for the last year at Portola Court and I am highly disappointed by two things:
1) Parking situation - though the apartment allows two car parking, one in garage and one in open spaces, but there is hardly any parking available for the second car. When I asked the management, they just said “we do not guarantee a parking for the second car”.
2) Staff - though the maintenance staff is very good, the office staff seems to just hides behind rules and at times “vindictive”. I have been fined almost $400 since I moved here for illegal parking. One time I parked my car for an hour because there was no space, and instead of calling me, they had it towed! Totally unlike Irvine company customer service.

Overall, looking at the prices of the aprathments (almost $2,000 for a 1BR) and the non-friendly office staff, I would not recommend this place.</Review><user_id>113787060823950551880</user_id><GmapID>0x80dcdd4555555537:0x2615158f84dee1a4< /GmapID></record>

<Text>Apartments look good but Sq footage is way off 1080 apartment really is approx 950 way over priced

Was a smokers complex. I was willing to chance it. Apartments  seemed nice but my showing agent was really nice but her rounder stubby manager was super snotty and borderline racist. My leasing agent  was ready to get me signed up right away but over a holiday break she got sick and her supervisor screwed up my application.

I do find it creepy that there are no keys it's like hotel access key card type of access. There's no access to hoa pool nearby. Much cheaper housing is near by. I went out of my way to check out the area and when I saw my potential  down stairs neighbor  was home on a work day smoking out on the porch  I decided to skip it.

Tons of construction nearby which will go on for many years. This deadlocks the road in the  morning when you commute to work. It really should be a reduced rate until construction is done and they should have NOT SMOKING buildings!

I'm very curious if you can hear your neighbors as most irvine company  buildings nearby have cheap thin walls where you hear everything!   The unit I looked at had no next door neighbors by the pool so idk. We'll see as peoples leases run out.

Also they advertised a car wash and I never saw one put up.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80dcdd4555555537:0x2615158f84dee1a4<//Gmap_id>< username>

Please know that our staff truly strives to welcome each visitor to our community with open arms and provide them with every opportunity to make Portola Court their home.  We truly appreciate any persons interest in our community and the only instances that we would not recommend someone move forward with touring would be in the event we did not have an apartment that met their needs.  For example, we have not had 3 bedroom apartments available for some time now and do not have any coming available in the near future, thus our staff would recommend one of our sister properties and take the time to set up an appointment with another Sales Specialist in those instances to be sure that those guests were well taken care of.  Our management hopes that we can learn more about your experience visiting our community to get a better understanding of what happened and how we can improve.  If you are willing to reach out to us, please contact portolacourt@irvinecompany.com or call 949-387-9900.\n\nVery Respectfully,\n\nThe Portola Court Team'}</response><gmap_id>0x80dcdd4555555537:0x2615158f84dee1a4<//gmap_id></record>

All right, I'm going to be honest I didn't go in here for the donuts. I went in to get some lottery tickets. Yes, just like everyone else I confess I too I have a dream that involves lottery tickets. A winning jackpot would make some serious fantasies come true. That said the store was very clean. It had air conditioning which was welcome as it was a very hot day. The person at the counter was very friendly. As I looked at the doughnuts I broke down and purchased a few and they were quite fresh and tasty. Now if only there is a winner here...< /review>

<Date>1591554297580</Date><Pictures>None</Pictures><text>This is a very happenin kind of donut/lil coffee shop  It's a local hanout spot for regulars in Harbor City in cute yet safe kinda way. Tho the neighborhood some would say maybe a bit on the rough side,,it does Harbor City prouD. It sits on a famous & for some a very historical landmark .. "Normandie & Lomita". A few steps and youre on Pch and Normandie.. .   Favorite Doughnuts is in the right smak dab of HC  . I would say that hands down this little cottage has definite,character & good vibes all day. I frequent there alot in the early evening  & the night guy is always just a breath of fresh air to anyone  He is always working hard with a very contagous joy to him ,& a bedside manner that is almost gaurenteed to make anyone smile. It has a lottery ticket machine ,an ATM,&even some old-school classic gum ball machines with all kinds of cool nicknacks that a quarter or two might getcha. They have great sanwhiches,chips of different sorts, a variety of candy for sale, even cigeretts, the best priced with in 10 a 10 mile radious,& hands down delicious coffee -& donuts. I give this place 5 stars anyday.This little joint
has spaz, with some serious Cali swagg,✌️❤️ . ,💯~ Heather B, a resident in Harbor City for 2years-<//text><gmapID>0x80dd3588726016c9:0xaaa208ec35fa8105<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great little donut shop unfortunately everything looks OK dirty and outdated. The donuts taste good but there's no air conditioning and the ambience seems substandard. They only take cash and there is only one or two people working throughout the day.<//Text>

<Review>Can't say enough good things about Sourdough & Co! We love it. The food is consistently delicious and the staff is always super nice.

Knowing that there is usually quite a wait if you go inside, we try to order online and then head in and pick it up. That makes it a very fast trip!

The peppered turkey with cheddar is good and the southwestern salad is a definite favorite, but there are combinations for everyone. When you get a soup or salad, the sourdough comes on the side. YUM!

Grab a few cookies too, they are delicious!</Review>< pictures>

Their special sauce is palatable, seems mayo based. Friendly staff.  I'll be back, for sure. Beats Firehouse, IMHO.<//Review>< pictures>

We stopped in, and had great sandwiches created by a group of friendly builders.
The bread was fresh and crispy.  The meat was tasty, and the toppings were fresh.

Loved it - certainly going to be back!<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHDSp02VCxQbgtl5j1mGoO7KsQf3W-DFfPhvKg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhpFHI6stA5uPDitpb5I4m5-_wgY5k8m6bI3-Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2ybuQ9STgPsut5Mn5E9UGJMf8I6PJTzCMeEnE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

<Rating>3</Rating><Review>The crust on the sandwiches is amazing! But, the sourdough is not very noticeable for being sour dough. The sandwiches are good and enjoyable but not extraordinary

Service was good, staff friendly. There's a patio around the back to eat at the location, but you have to know this, I didn't see any signs to direct you there.

You are also supposed to use hand sanitizer prior to using the soda fountain, though it's up to the customer to read the sign, so you might want to choose a canned drink if you want to reduce the chances of exposure to COVID-19.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1598929283405, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your feedback, Jean!

We were here on August 6th. There is a huge sign on the door that says MASK IS REQUIRED to enter the store. We saw two young guys walking around in the store without a mask. The employees of this store served them without saying anything about the mandatory face covering that they have in place. My husband and an older gentleman draw the employees attention to this issue. The gentleman said that he has high risk of getting Covid and they should have someone that enforces the rules. They said “ it is not required to wear a mask at this store”. The older gentleman pointed at the door and said that “ there is a huge sign on the door stating otherwise” and that they should enforce it. One of the employees said that it’s the manager’s responsibility to enforce it and the manager is not here. Say what??? It is absolutely unacceptable! Many people have serious pre-existing conditions and need to be protected. It is not a big deal to wear a mask to protect each other. Finally, if your store complies with the mandatory mask wearing rule and it is clearly put on the door then ENFORCE IT! Ps: service was extremely slow with 9-10 people being behind the counter working on orders. 32 minute waiting time for 2 sandwiches.< /Text>

I keep going here because there isn’t any other sandwich shop nearby. It’s really bad though so I’m finally done with it and not going to waste my money anymore. Three times now I’ve had to throw out my sandwich because it is completely drowning and soggy with what they call their special sauce (I think it’s thousand island dressing). I tell them please no sauce every time. They just can’t do it!</text>

Busy little sandwich shop with limited seating, but excellent sandwiches served on the best sourdough bread.

I had the Reuben, which was not a traditional Reuben, but was very good. The pastrami was a little bland, but the swiss and sauerkraut were wonderful. The pickle slice was a nice touch.

Staff were friendly and energetic.

Definitely a nice little place for lunch.< /review>

They are always super friendly, on time not to mention great food. These guys have taken care of our large orders every time and we never have an issue. We had a little issue today for the first time with some missing items. Instantly they had the missing items made (no questions asked) very apologetic and the owner was in the car delivery those to us immediately. He also added in some extras and a gift card. Absolutely fantastic service even when a mistake was made. I love a business that is quick to say we appreciate our customer's and right the wrong. Mistakes happen and it's nice to see a business provide such great customer service. That is becoming harder to find. Thanks again.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Given this place about 8 tries or so, and they're consistently inconsistent. Sometimes they're great, sometimes you get a cold sandwich that was supposed to be hot. Sometimes you'll find long hair in your food (employees don't have their hair covered!!!). Sometimes the creamy soups and clam chowder are thick, other times they're water. When they do it right, they nail it. When they don't, they make sure you feel completely ripped off for how much you paid. They're just so freaking good when they nail it, that I keep coming back, even though it's an absolute crap shoot on what you get.</Review>

Great food, but a little on the pricey side. Ordered a ham and pastrami sandwich and it was about 90% ham and only 10% pastrami, a nice 50/50 split would have been nicer. I will say that all of the ingredients on the sandwiches were high-quality, ham was especially tender. I did have a MAJOR surprise in my sandwich which wasn't good but they were very quick to remedy the situation as well as go above and beyond.</review>

Lines can get a bit long- order online if you are on a tight lunch break. Food is really tasty! Totally redeems the sandwich shop idea ruined by Subway.<//Review>

Great place for lunch! Everything is so fresh and tasty all the time! You will not be disappointed, especially in their sourdough and soups!  You save a little more with the sandwich soup meal ;)<//Text>

Horrible. You have the worlds simplest menu. When you get a soup you get bread. Low and behold no bread with my soup. On top of it the staff was pretty awful. Which in turn is probably why i was dissatisfied< /review>

Looks like a chain. Feels like a "mom and pop" kinda sandwich joint. Unbelievably friendly. Great bread. Service solid. Love it!  Definite regular place for locals and a must have for people passing thru. Will stop here every trip.</Text>

Love the sourdough bread bowls. They carry clam chowder every day as well as one additional soup that changes daily. They also have sandwiches, and all of the bread is baked in the morning and warmed in an oven just prior to serving.<//text>

My favorite order.  #13 - Large - no house spread.  Add Cucumber, Avocado, Bacon, Pickles, and all the regular veggies.  Get a side of a drink and chips and you should be good to go</Text>

These sandwiches are awewsome!  My husband and I work close by in the business park and we call in an order at least once a week.  If you know what you're going to order, I suggest calling it in.  The wait can be long as this is a popular place with locals.  Great sandwiches!< /text>

<review>Wanted to pet club to get my dogs vaccinated Sunday, 25 April.  took all my information down by the time we’re ready to go to the back to get it done they denied my 6 month old puppy. Didn’t get his name very rude. I will never step foot in there due to the veterinary VIP club that was there. I Always use them. But when you have bad service Then it spoils everything. I’m sure the pet club is decent but because of the Rudeness of the veterinary staff we will tell all my friends to never go in there to get there pets vaccinated.</review><rating>1< /rating></record></dataset><record>

Best prices in town and wide variety of major pet foods and supplies. Although it's name says "Club", it is open to the public - no membership or fees required.< /text>

It was an all around decent trip to the Elk Grove "Pet Club", sure didnt feel like I was apart of any club tho to say the least. Due to Not one person spoke to me the entire time I wandered down EVERY single isle in the damn store, straight Lost.... so it took me 5 times longer then I originally anticipated, which then set back my entire night. Sadly Now I'm thinking I should of just hit up one of the big box pet store "Smart Pet or Co Pets" because we all know they bug the dog piss out of ya which would of got me out a lot quicker... idk wouldn't roll through pet club unless you have some time to waste and money sh*t was pricey as hell..<//Text>

I was very disappointed to see one employee with her mask down around her neck instead of covering her mouth and nose. And another employee (who appeared to be a lead worker or maybe a manager) with no mask at all. There was also a customer in the store without a mask. I will give this store one more chance but if they cannot follow the appropriate public health requirements I will not return.< /text>

<Review>This is a great place to get pet supplies. I only buy my dog food from Pet Club because the prices are very good and the employees are so helpful! I have to buy a large bag of better dog food for my Great Dane with a sensitive stomach. They always offer to load the bag in my car!</Review><rating>5< /rating>< gmapID>

Certain areas of the store are unclean and poorly maintained. Found what I came in to purchase and the cashier was respectful.<//review>

< Review>
We love pet club at our house. They have anything you really need for ALL your pets! We have dogs, chickens, hamsters, frogs and fish and we can get anything we need for them in one location for a fraction of the price as other stores. There is 1 older gal there and it kills me I can't remember her name right now but she is amazing! She is so knowledgeable and helpful! I hope she is the manager because she needs to be if not. Other employees are nice but none of them work as hard as she does by far!!<//Review>

<review>Hi and Merry Christmas to all. Pet Club is always one of the best places to go for things for your animals. But I think still one of the best highlights is the old fashioned gumball machine. You can take your animals the kids the family and have a great time there.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

The staff was ready to help us. They gave my dog some treats with permission first. They gave us all the information we needed on the products for us to make the best choice. Overall great store! They also have VIP Pet Care there on Thursday and Sundays. It is a cheap price to get your pet up to date on all of it's shots.</text>

Good selection, reasonable prices. Staff are nice and very helpful - always willing to carry stuff out for you if it's too heavy! Store does not accept credit cards, so make sure you have debit or cash (it's part of how they keep their prices low) Clean and pet friendly, lots of customers bring their dogs in to help shop.< /Text>

Great! I came only to see the fish so I didn't check out the rest of the store but I believe the lady who helped me was named Melissa? A little older with long brown hair. She was extremely informative and made me quite confident in my plan for my new 10 gallon tank! She was also very nice and funny! More than happy to answer anything I might ask. She's a good face for this store!< /Text>

<review>I really like this pet store! They are very well versed in knowledge of the animals and they have a good variety of fish. No birds last time I was there but hopefully they get them back soon they had very beautiful birds when they had them. The items here are pretty well priced and they make a good competitor to other pet stores price wise.< /review>< Date>

I went there because I was looking for some loose cat  sand and apparently none of the other stores sell it. I bought some but it has a lot of dust in it and I can't really complain about it because the person that did tell me ahead of time that it has dust in it but I was not expecting so much. I used to go to this particular store all the time but since other store has opened I mostly go there because I'm also a member of Banfield. This is a nice clean store that you can definitely tell it is kind of old and needs a facelift. The staff is nice and friendly.</Review>

<Review>If you have a pet that eats live food, particularly feeder fish, this is by far the best place in Elk Grove to get them. The tanks are well maintained and always full of a unique collection of species. The staff in the Aquatic department is knowledgeable and helpful to a T. They always offer quality insight without coming off as sanctimonious, a fine line to walk. You can tell the staff at Pet Club are all pet owners and are actively interested in animal welfare and well being.<//Review>< Name>

My dog is on special food because he has a special diet. I usually get his food on Amazon because the vet charges way too much. My dog was out of food so I went to Pet Club and I saw that they had the food that he needs and it was $4 cheaper then Amazon. It was a plus because I did not have to wait 2 days to get the dog food from Amazon. We also bought some new bowls for him they were pretty comparable to Amazon. I will definitely go back again.<//Text>< Pics>

This store is awesome and the staff is great. If they don't have what you need they either can get it for you or they can find it. It's always clean and I love the fish and bird areas. The fish tanks are clean and decorated to keep the fish happy and the same for the birds. Thanks guys sure wish you were in So Cal.</review>

<review>Always have my product, my last visit  the didn't have the small bag of dog food and that's what I wanted to pay so they gave me a 5 dollar discount for the bigger bag, that made my day. That's making a customer happy.<//review>< gmap_id>

<Text>I like going to Pet Club because they have a nice selection and the prices are pretty good better than those other two fame or famous pet stores. They have some good sales. So I watch for the sales and stuck up when I can. Sometimes I'm just walking around and I'll see a new toy for one of the cats. So this is been a pretty good place to shop there's a couple other places right around by that if you want to get something when you're doing your pet shopping you can as well. And it's got a nice parking lot for parking in plenty of spaces they're usually not overly full.< /Text>< Pictures>

Great place for dog and cat supplies! They often carry great products the other big box pet stores don't have. I wouldn't bother with the reptiles or reptile supplies. The fish department is hit and miss. Often a good selection and the people are helpful but the fish quality is hit and miss. I still personally buy fish there but be careful.<//Review>

The best pet supply prices for food!  The equipment, kennels and cat furniture are still pricey, but the food, toys and grooming products are the best you'll find.  Always clean and well stocked, friendly staff.</Text>

They are the only store that carries my dog food brand. And at a low price. Chewy has it but at 30 dollars more. A+ for this store and great place to get vaccines for dogs puppies and cats.</review>

While it has a ware house feel, the people are nice and helpful Cat food cost half as much as it costs at Petco. There is an excellent selection of food, cat litter, toys and etc. They also have large and small sizes.<//Review></record></dataset><record>
<Review>Since I am a dog and have a rather large family to feed, I find it necessary to do my shopping at pet Club , the canines Costco. Preferably, I would hunt for my families nutritional needs, but who has the time for that these days? Pet club is the next best thing. Give your pets what they deserve.</Review>< username>

Staff is great... never had a problem when buying fish. 1 week return policy on fresh with separate water sample. They will also order whatever you want if they do not have it in stock no extra charge which is nice. Very truthful I went to get a gold guarami the other day and she told me no the ones she just got in were no good wait until next weeks order came in. Most places would sell you the fish anyway<//Text>

I just bought a marine penguin tha that's a 75 gallon filtration and I brought back in for an exchange. It was working great for two weeks going on 3 weeks and the rubber wheel burned out causing the bearing to stick. I explained that it was only 3 weeks old and he thought it's been about six months not that it was an arguement. Like in said they are very customer friendly and after knowing its only been a few weeks, he understood and exchanged the penguine 75 gal. No problem and everyrhi g was taken and looked at professionally. Thank you pet club for your understanding and Visa versa as j would not cheat you on a product if it was my fault.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x809ac71c8d435e7f:0x7dbedecf8c28712b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Great customer service!! Don't buy fish from them. My fish I had for 15 years got sick and died after I purchased new fish from this store. I went back and talked to the fish lady and she sold me medicine and a 8 month supply of filters and all the fish still died. I am upset and will never shop at this pet store again if they don't make it up to me somehow. My fish i had for 15 years I am heartbroken.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>I just wanted to give props to this Pet Club. I will probably edit once I remember everyone's names. My family came here to get our first fish tank and were given advice on cycling, food, conditioner, tank size, etc. The employees were extremely helpful and polite, which isn't easy with all the questions we had. I looked up a lot of what they said and it all fit. I am very impressed by how well informed they are. We usually come here in the evenings to get the same employees. This store is our top pick out of any Petsmart, Petco, whatever for what we need and I will be coming here for my guinea pigs needs as well now. The prices especially for their aquarium kits are decent also. The cashier also seemed to remember us and was very friendly as well. Definitely recommend.<//review><userid>118116929451473947501</userid>< Rate>

<Name>Mike F< /Name><Time>1497129574112< /Time><Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Melissa the fish lady needs to learn how customer service works.

If you have a customer waiting for 20 minutes with a fish in hand that they are trying to return you don't get to sit and chat and exchange Facebook information with a previous customer that entire time, while a line of other customers are waiting for you.

Then, when you manage to pull yourself away from your new infatuation for 2 minutes to take the fish, you should probably ask if the customer needs anything before walking away to go chat again with your newfound friend.

I mean damn, have a little situational awareness and common sense when you're on the clock.

Was planning to spend $100+ on pet supplies for my various animals + a new fish, but since Melissa couldn't be bothered to pay any attention I chose to take my money to PetSmart instead.< /Review>< Pictures>

Rude! Very rude around closing time! Awful customer service especially when the selfish cashiers are near the end of their shift.  ..I've had this problem with them a few times before!!..  I live across town and called before I left my house to make sure they would be open (they have the WORST weekend hours) the girl who answered said they were open til 7.. so I drove across town straight there to find other angry people at the door.. at 5:03pm ..they denied our phone call and rudely pointed at a sign on the door with the holiday hours for 5pm (it's Easter) ..fine lie to us and treat us like garbage because your selfish cashier wants to go home ..I drop $$$ on my pets and will be taking my business elsewhere- bad bad business ethics.. fail pet club management..
