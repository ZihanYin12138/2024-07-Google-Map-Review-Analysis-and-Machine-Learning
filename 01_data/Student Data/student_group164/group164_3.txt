This post office has lost THOUSANDS of packages, mishandled packages and delivers packages to the WRONG address on a DAILY basis! I have filed more complaints with this office in the past 5 years than I have ever filed in my 46 years of living in other locations!< /Review>

I have not been receiving  my mail
For two weeks , I put a complaint in and the supervisor had the audacity to call me and argue with me and couldn’t answer any of my questions. He works for USPS and doesn’t know where my mail is or how to locate it, the so called supervisor ZIN ZHOU is so unprofessional and needs to be fired ASAP!</Text>

Been having some real issues with mail, not receiving mail for days, getting other peoples mail. My neighbors are having the same problems. In fact my neighbor received 8 letters from EDD that belonged to different addresses. This is a huge problem and needs to be fixed. Come on Lewis rd Usps let’s get some new management or something. Going down there tomorrow to file a complaint. Not sure if I’m wasting my time< /text>

The delivery driver said he couldn’t deliver because I wasn’t home and there was no access to my unit. I was at home all day and nobody came in, and funny how I live on the outside complex facing the street so there is no need for gate code. The driver simply didn’t want to deliver my package. This location needs new employees. They also never pick up their phone. Disappointing!</review>

We called before driving here to see if we could ship a package during this pandemic and the man led us to believe we could but when we got to the location and tried to enter, we were told to deive 11 minutes away to a different location to ship our small package. I don't understand why the employee gives incorrect info.</Review>

This is by far the worst post office I have ever been to. People here are rude and I avoid to come here if I don't need to. I live down the street and will typically use the post office by my work or one in Eastridge just to avoid the service.  I am finally moving after 17 years and I am so glad I don't ever have to deal with these people again!< /Review>

Awesome. Easy to get to park and take care of what can be done. Google should say though that it’s not a full service post office. It’s just for mailing and residents of the area to get their mailing necessities. Like their keys to their box and their mail. It’s not for stamps and accessories.

Service was on point. Got me keys in less than 2 min. Thanks!<//Text>

I don't know why people complain so much about this location, service is efficient and the guy over there (it's not always there, but most of the time) the one with glases, its fast and friendly (not over friendly, but come on, the guy it's working!) If anything, maybe some expanded hours on Saturday would be great.< /Text>

These people needs to be fired.

Edit: After my initial comment, they managed to not deliver my package 4 times in a row after that! No notes, no notices. How did they even managed that?! The kicker is that none of them even picks up the phone even if you come to their office and see people walking around. If you're one of the few that got your mails without any hiccups, then you're EXTREMELY lucky.<//Review>

Over half a year using this post office to pick my mail and packages. There could be hiccups, but this place is not retail and is not supposed to attend general public. The staff tries their best to do their job. Treat them well and they will treat you well back. People commenting on the appearance of the place and poor "customer service" are just ignorant.< /Review>

If I could give no star, that would be my rating. I've called for 3 hours in a row, yet have not been able to speak to an attendant. I have not received mail delivery to my office in the past two days and this is completely unacceptable.
I can understand a possible back up in mail due to the holidays, it would considerate of the post office to at least send out a notification or at the very least answer their phones. I'm highly dissatisfied with the 80 Lewis Road, Customer Service!!!</text>

I was just noticed by the post office lady that an international package will be returned to its home country tomorrow by 5:00pm since it has been sitting in their office for 5 days :(  They said no one was home when they were delivering it to my home. I ask them whether they left a note. They said "No, we could not leave a note".

Ok, how could I know I had a package sitting in their office for 5 days while I have been waiting for this important package. Luck enough, the lady finally called  me before they return it to the foreign country :(</Text>

<text>If I could give less than 1 star I would. I've had packages they say are delivered not be anywhere on my property. And the customer service is abysmal both in the office and on the phone. Once thing I will say is that our regular mail carrier is great. But anyone but her is delivering to us, stuff is damaged, or missing, and the mail is usually way later than our normal carrier gets it done. And then you have to deal with the people at this location and they are shady and move at a glacial pace. And good luck getting anything done over the phone because I've never had any luck getting any of the multiple delivery issues fixed over the phone. You'll have to go in for that. It is extremely frustrating.</text>< user_name>

This post office has lost packages of mine on multiple occassions.  Also, every time I actually have to visit this branch there is a line of people waiting for service, and only one person working.  Every time I try to call this branch, I can't even get through - just a busy signal.  Its like the one person shows up to work for the day, takes the phone off the hook, then hangs it back up once they leave for the day.  This branch needs to be better staffed....horrible service all the way around.</text>

<Review>Usually this place sucks but as of late (specifically since a Paul started working there) it's gotten much better. I was able to call them (around 1pm on a friday) and Paul picked up right away. He checked to see if my package was there and put it forward to avoid any mistakes from their less-than-par employees. Paul saved this place and thus, I'm writing a good review. fkn 4 stars earned $$$$$. //dude deserves a cape ya know?<//Review>< Pics>

Instead of trying to get a signature, they just leave a note in your mailbox.  Only deliver packages once a week.  Better service from the pony express.</text>

I drove across town to get certified mail here and I waited 45 minutes to find out the incompetent staff lost the mail. The post office also aesthetically looks like a laundromat that sold all of their washing machines and now just has a pair of dirty white lawn chairs for people to sit on while waiting to find out their mail is missing. The building is unprofessional, the staff are sub-human, and even during normal business hours nobody answers the phone there.<//review>

They dont bother delivering mails. They just leave a tag everytime. This is getting ridiculous, sometimes i stayed home all day expecting packages and there are no knocks on the door but when I walk out the door to check BAM theres the tag! It tells you to go pick it up.
I just moved in the area and do not have transportation yet and this bloody post office forces me to pay for uber inorder to get my pacakages?? Mail man please do your job, if you dont felt like delivering stuff to ppls home then get another job, quit screwing with other peoples' time and money!</text>

This post office does NOT SELL POSTAGE. it's basically just a mail drop off. Should be listed differently so people don't waste time coming here.< /text>

My package shipped to here and stuck here for over a month..Three other packages I ordered from China had lost here also....Another package had been opened and stolen items and they stamped the package damaged but actually it had been stolen. Please whoever run this post office should check their employees for honesty. So far too many items had been lost from this place....hello ...what is going on with this place?<//Text>

<Text>They need to close this place down. It's a dump, the employees are useless.
I don't know if it's the sorters or the carriers but my mail is being delivered to the wrong address. I have not received packages that they say have been delivered. This is the worst post office I have ever had to deal with. I called last week because I got an email stating that they had left a notice at 7: pm at my door saying my package couldn't be delivered because there was no secure place to leave it.  There was no notice left at my door. So I called to find out where my package was and the person I talked to said she would have to call me back in 10 mins. After 2 hours and no phone return call I call them back. I told the person who answered about the person I talked to the first time and I wanted to know where my package was. He said he didn't know what to tell me. So asked if I could talk to his supervisor and he tells me the 1st person I talked to was his supervisor but she had gone home 2hrs before. Wonderful!!!! This place is horrible.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I usually do not write negative reviews unless I have gone though a really bad experience. This office does not have friendly personnel, rude, rude, rude even when you talk over the phone, you ask questions they talk over you in a rude manner way before you even finish your sentence. Rude, rude. then when you pick up a package there, the uneducated personnel takes 30 minutes to find a damn package.< /review>

It's hard selling in the day when I don't get my mail in till anywhere between 5 to 8 o'clock at night it's ridiculous...Only 1 mail person gives me my packages. I am a stay at home mother I see when they get here every day and yet I got a little letter saying they tried to give me my package 2 times but I was not home so they were going to send it back. It was 2 week late. I recently ordered and have been waiting for my package to come in I thought it was the company so I called them they said they sent the packet and it should have been delivered yet I still have not received anything I can't help but to think that it is the post office this is ridiculous. Not to mention I am always getting my neighbors mail sometimes not even the same block I also get mail from people who lived here 3 years ago and I always send it back but they do not pick it up they will leave it in the mailbox and shove it to the back. Not to mention the mail lady made a made a comment that I won't be able to find a career with all my tattoos. Unacceptable. You know NOTHING ABOUT me (lol) to be making comments about my appearance.</text>< pics>

Came here to print photos. Photos  look poorly printed and one of the books had glue on the outside of the book not like a dot of glue it had glue all over the back page. You can see the staples showing in the middle where the book closes. The edges look like a five year old cut them. Not what I was expecting. The canvas was poorly made and off centered, even though I centered it on the app. I don’t recomen this place for large prints.< /review>

It's always dirty here, and there are rats running around the bushes at night.</Review>

I definitely am probably what you would call a difficult customer and I feel bad sometimes but I do want specific things and I do like to be given a valid reason as to why things don’t work out the way that I want them to I just had a really great experience reluctantly do you store it was very helpful in helping me find what I needed to get in if they didn’t have it they actually compensated me for that which was amazing so I just can’t believe it because again I usually don’t get that kind of response from any store like I said I’m kind of a picky difficult customer so I really appreciate their patience with me and I give them five stars definitely great store<//text>

Hello GM/ Corporate personal! I would like to inform you that Mr. Tyrone does not have great Customer service but I could be wrong, I would leave you to determine that.
Today 1/5/21 at @6:40 pm I called to see if they had any oximeters. He said that they did not. He said I could search for myself online. I told him that the website was giving me problems. He said he couldn't help me more! What kind of service is that????</review>

<Text>I go to this location often acompanying my elderly handicapped grandmother. Mr. Prince  not sure if it’s his first or last name was the manager on duty and unfortunately responded to my question with another question over and over again barely even allowing me to explain my previous experience and why I was asking in regards to the lines of checking out and getting western union services. When he was no help in getting clarification I asked to speak to a manger and said well I am the manager basically shutting me down completely.</Text><user_name>Fluffiness U_U< /user_name><rating>1<//rating><user>109473714346818600477<//user>< GmapID>

<review>My mother went to this Walgreens to get drive-thru testing for COVID-19. She was denied a test because the woman working the drive-thru at the time said she needed to show an ID showing US citizenship to be attended. She is 70 years of age and cannot drive. The employee demanded to see an American passport and driver's license. I felt like she was discriminated</review><user>110867081661193180343< /user><Time>1609906336386< /Time>< Rate>

Got my things, lined up at the register and was told to go to another one (even though my stuff was at this register and the line was very short). Went over to it and dropped a quarter, which then another customer wanted it because she thought it was hers. Finally after buying my things I went back to the other register(with my things) and requested for my backpack, the cashier then STILL wanted to see my receipt. I showed him the back of it, but he still wanted to read it, and I was finally able to leave. Overall bad experience for me, wouldn't be that bad if they asked nicely for my receipt or money.<//text>< pictures>

I just had the best experience I've ever had at any store like Walgreens!!  I went to Walgreens to purchase a pre-paid cell phone and wound up looking at the latest clever new make-up items offered and then I found a clearance rack with miscellaneous beauty supply.  All the while Sylvia had offered to help me with anything twice now already and both times was able to answer my questions as far as prices on the clearance items I was inquiring about.  She even helped ring me up and I was able to bring home all of the things I wanted after she helped me apply the reward points I had been stocking up!!  It was such a surprise  to get everything that I felt like I had won something on a game show.  The staff there were very nice and professional and decent to me.  I don't get that kind of treatment at most stores I have been to in this part of town and it has put me in great spirits and all smiles.</Review>

The prices are ridiculous high. Target has way better prices than this store. Compare your self, buy the same product on this store then try target. I don't know how can this store stay in business. I hate it.< /review>

Interior has grease spots on driver seat left from dirty hands and to top it off, didn't vacuum or wipe down well. I understand its a Sunday but if your open and taking people's money,  do your job correctly. Never going back to this place. I should have inspected before leaving to pump gas. Smh. Can't believe these guys are in business.</Text>< pics>

They do a great job. Yes they are Mexican, but what does that matter. As long as I get a great job done on my truck. It's funny when a reviewer complains about the race of what the workers are. If you don't want a sertain race washing your car just wash it your self. It's common sense.< /text>

Sketchy place. I've been there twice, first time I paid$25 for a full service wash. Next time I came they charged me $45, $3 to remove mud(should be part of the wash). $17 for armor all. And while I was waiting someone that had their Car washed earlier had panda Express in the car and one of the employees ate it. After he left the employees ewer laughing and joking about it. Last time ilI' go there.< /text>

<text>The guys who work here are super funny and laid back . Very decent selection and they know their products and are always willing to shoot a discount if your really interested in something they make it hard to say no with such good deals. I definitely have had a great experience everytime I go in there and they are always up to date with new smoking devices. A place I definitely recommend</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x54d2ed4b742dc249:0x8239b105b2fe04ad<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Best shop I have been to. Not only the best prices on almost all products of any shop around, the customer service is by far the most helpful and most accommodating I have ever experienced at a smoke shop. Will continue going here for all of my products.<//Review>

After trying multiple vape shops in town I didn’t even realize there was one next to the gas station I was filling up at. I”m glad I stepped in to Tony’s Smoke Shop because they had the best prices, best customer service and best availability. I had called the store the other night at about 10:45pm and asked if I could come down. The catch was, I was on my bike! TJ said no worries and was willing to earn my business anyway. Customer service like that doesn’t grow on tress. In addition, he I had about 100 questions for him and he answered all of them with a great attitude. I honestly thought he was the owner because of how professional he was. Shoot, he might even be the owner. But I suggest you give this store a try and ask for TJ. I assure you he will hook you up, help you out, and you will leave wanting to return real soon.< /Text>

Best service I could ever imagine,  they're wonderful people and the vapes are very well priced. Tony's glass pieces are also priced amazingly low. If you are looking for wonderful customer service and wonderful low prices look no further and step into Tony's smoke shop and get what you need. Pj is a wonderful guy tell him I sent ya and he'll help you get what your looking for!<//Text>

Great service and great selection. They didn't have what I wanted but helped me find a juice that was really good and said they would order what I wanted and it would be in next week. Pretty cool. Other stores just kinda shrugged their shoulders. I recommend this vape shop.< /review>

FANTASTIC find on my way back to Oregon! Customer service is STUPENDOUS! PJ was very helpful, personable and knowledgeable of all the products. They did not have what I was looking for but PJ gave me some great suggestions on similar products that I was very happy with. I will definitely be making Tony's a routine stop on my many travels back and forth to Cali & Oregon. Very happy with this shop!< /text>

<review>The younger guy who always works there is so kind and always makes deals with his customers. When I go to this smoke shop I feel like I buying from my friend and I feel right at home there. It’s very clean and tidy and the prices are the best of any smoke shop I’ve gone to in Redding. Will recommend to all friends and family and will always take my business there!!<//review>< pics>

Place is hidden away from plain view but is the epitome of hole in the wall Mexican food joint! It's a hidden gem.

Got the carne asada fries, small order. Look at that size! Most places would give you a lot less.

The thin cut fries were cooked well and carne asada is flavorful and well done. Comes with cheese, sour cream, guac and cotija. If you're from San Diego you'd know most joints won't give you both sour cream and guac so I was pleasantly surprised.

This is the classic San Diegan carne asada fries and you won't be disappointed! Hot sauce was flavorful as well. They do have an extra  spicy jalapeno hot sauce that's perfectly complements the fries.</Review>

Hands down. Thank God for the señoritas in the kitchen. Puts a lot of love into their service. Well done carne asada and very flavorful. Absolutely the best hand made tortillas i’ve tasted.< /text>

Lived in IB my whole life and eaten at every Mexican place in southbay and this place is highly overrated. Food was OK burrito was puny. Do yourself a favor and just go to Armando's by the trolly. Way better food, bigger portions and cheaper.< /text>

A mix of good and bad service. The cashier took her time to take my order and didn't offer a drink until I asked what kind of drinks they have. The guy in the kitchen was real  fast and the food was good.< /Text>

Me and my friends have been coming to this taco shop for quite a while, but recently on Sunday theirs this one girl that always gets our order wrong, doesn't provide friendly service, doesn't know what the store offers in drinks even if we can clearly see the fridge right there, over charges us when we want extras and even when we know what we order she still tries to over charge us. I miss the other lady's from the weekdays!! But I'm still going because the food is good just gets annoying that we have to ask to remake our food 2-3 times because it ain't right.</Review>

Been going there since 2013 and my top picks are Chile Verde Burrito, Breakfast Burrito, or Carne Asada Fries. Sometimes I call ahead of time or order in person, or I send my friend to get the food. Today 4/4/17 I decided to call ahead, and its been a while I hvnt been there. I tried to order Chile Verde burrito and the girl stated that there's no such thing,only the plate option. I was confused,  she said they have never made any Chile Verde "burrito". Ended driving over and talk to them in person, so apparently both the girl taking orders and the chef guy are NEW employees. So I told them I've always order the burrito. Took me sometime to convince them, at the end I got my Chile Verde Burrito!! .. no bad arguments happened, I think they did great w costumers service. For that I had to tip them.. so I give them 5 stars!< /review>

I guess I could say the absolute only complaint I have about this place is that there's really nothing to complain about. When it comes to self-serve car washes there's only two types of places ones where everything is broken and it really doesn't get your car clean at all and then there's Denny's. Everything installed I was in work, I had zero problems with anything. And my work van looks amazing. I realize I'm doing all the work, I realize I'm getting wet if I'm not careful, but you know what there's something very satisfying about washing my car by hand. Doing the work myself. And you know what I saved a lot of money compared to a traditional car wash. There's going to come point your car is going to need to be washed. That's just the nature of owning one. Save yourself some money, be willing to put in a little bit effort, and you will be rewarded with a completely clean and beautiful looking vehicle.< /Review>

<Date>1620838942333</Date><text>Not as good as the other car washes I've used.  I have a ford transit, 9ft high, and I need the stairs to reach the top of the car. This car wash had the one with the stairs but only for one side so it was very difficult to get the top of the car cleaned. I'm short so I couldn't really reach with the brush. There was no soap coming out of the brush and the brush itself didn't really help with taking off the dirt.  On the plus side this car wash had an air blower to assist with drying.  The vacuum part of the wash was cheaper than where I usually go but it didn't have the aromatic option.  This wash was on the way to an appt I had and I had time to get my car washed but I would not go again. I feel my car still needs a good wash.</text></record>

The machines don’t work. No one to report a problem. Good luck getting your cash back, the machines only take cash no credit cards.< /Text>

$1.25 for 3 minutes vacum? You end up paying $5 dollars to vacuum a small car.

<text>The guys here are very fast, efficient, friendly, and do a great job! It’s not a fancy place with a fancy waiting room. But, they have good equipment and good workers. Their prices are very reasonable and they appreciate repeat business.

I’ve been coming here for at least three years and I’ve never had to wait more than 15 to 20 minutes. Most of the time I don’t have to wait at all or maybe 5-10 minutes. I’ve taken three different vehicles here to get tires mounted and balanced and each time they’ve done a great job! I’ve had some issues with other places that I’ve gone to in the past... So, this is my number one go to place!< /text>< resp>

Replaced a passenger side front wheel new tire with $130. The guy first told me the warranty is 65K miles. But, later the receipt says 65 miles. Am I being fooled?</review>

Great people, very helpful.  Found me a used tire that had better tread than my good tires.  Great price too!  Will be going back to get the rest of my tires changed.< /review>

<text>Great value and great look for my 2016 Panamera.  Factory Wheel Republic was very easy to work with and was straight forward about the process.

<Review>!!!!LOVE THIS PLACE!!! This place has the best quality Wheels on the market. I will never go anywhere else and they are friendly and always work super fast. My Tesla looks amazing now for half the price of other places. They sell tires and rims and trust me when I say its worth the drive if you live far.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>I love love love this place! Jan and his crew were  awesome to work with. I’ve been searching high and low for the perfect rims for my new Porsche.

I not only purchased at a great price, but also bought wheels and a caliber break paint job.

Came out fantastic! I’m a customer from now on and will send all my friends in need of an upgrade to his store!<//Review><time>1603302553288<//time></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Great prices, very prompt communication, fast shipping, and the best protective packaging I've ever received for shipped wheels and tires (it will take you 5 minutes just to unbox and unwrap each wheel and tire).  All items were exactly as described in new condition (I'm very picky and inspected everything closely), and the included TPMS sensors paired immediately.  All 4 tires were already aired up and balanced out of the box. Based on my outstanding experience, I would definitely buy from Factory Wheel Republic again, and highly recommend them to others looking for OE wheels and tires.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dd27525d37af57:0xb1b891974c4bd52e</GmapID></record>

We met Jan at Factory Wheel Republic on Friday. We were looking for new rims for our “new” 2013 Range Rover that we had just purchased. He hooked us up on Monday and now we have beautiful new satin finish rims that make the vehicle look sporty. We couldn’t be happier with results and service we received. I highly recommend FWR!< /Text>

<text>Great doing business with Factory Wheel Republic...!👏🏾💪🏾
Although, with a brief, minor hiccup...!! Kia's wheel manufacturer had a tarnished jewel in the rough~a "9.0"×19 wheel???🤯🤔
Jan and FWR immediately went into action sending a replacement wheel and handled business, above and beyond, west coast to east coast (FedEx'd & w/inclement weather) in record times, (2x's)...!!☆☆☆☆☆5👏🏾💪🏾
Thanks again for our new relationship. HIGHLY recommend FWR for your wheel purchase...Mine look GR8T😁< /text>< Resp>

<text>Awesome transaction. Very good price on rims! Checked stealership and they wanted more than 6K for rims. Ordered rims from Factory Wheel Republic and they arrived less than a week after purchasing. Jan even threw in some TPMS monitors free of charge! Who does that -  Factory Wheel Republic does!! Condition of wheels were perfect and look awesome. My wife was very pleased. Thanks Factory Wheel Republic. I highly recommend if you what good value and great service.<//text>< time>

I contacted this company to ensure fitment and delivery. They responded VERY promptly, and assured me all was well. I placed the order, and the wheels were shipped to me VERY fast! They arrived from California to New Jersey in 5 days during a pandemic! The tracking numbers were provided, and I was kept aware of the entire process. The wheels were safely packaged and completely undamaged. I had them mounted, and the process was flawless. These are honest dealers here, and I wouldn’t hesitate to order from them again! Thank you for a flawless process, and great business!!!< /text>

Since I was considered local, they made arrangements to ensure that I would not pay for shipping and coordinate a pick-up on a weekend. They help me procure the proper lug nuts for my rims.

I had the rarest experience in a longest time to meet someone who's not only genuine,but free spirited being who has made my day nothing but a pure pleasure & appreciative moment when having encountered him. Simply went in to his shop to purchase a set of rims & tires and humbly gained a real friend! Very professional,courteous,generous,& knowledgeable man who's straight forward with absolutely no sales pitch whatsoever. I proposed an offer(Killer deal by the way) and he accepted and out of there installed in no time. He's got an inventory of various selection arranging from Ford to Ferrari and only carries carefully selected/pristine stuff here at an unheard of prices. Atmosphere of his shop is well organized,welcoming,& friendly. It really is a hidden gem spot and I hope for anyone who's in the market to purchase a wheels/tires to give it a shot,because it's seriously hard to find a shop/owner like this in these days! You will surely gain a real friend which is priceless... Jan is the MAN(!) and thank you for this rarest experience which I never even had anticipated of encountering by simply buying something. The 21" wheel setup is perfect and thank you for "zero to hero" formula(You'll know what this phrase means when you meet him^^) Bless you Jan! Continue to stay safe and awake and continue your natural talent to please & bless everyone you come to encounter,because it's a gift you possess and must spread!
I'll see you soon!~
Best regards,

<review>These guys are unreal I love the rims I purchased for my E 550 perfect. Customer service is great reminds me of the old days when businesses appreciated their customers. I just called to have an extra set of center caps sent to me to have on hand just in case. And he was sending them out right away and charged almost nothing for them.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Terrible service and very misinforming! I dedicated time to come to the shop and bring cash to get the wheels that were initially 1400 after talking about them on the phone a couple times and texting back and forth to make sure everything was good and when I showed up the guy tried to say that there was a misunderstanding and the tires were actually 1700 bucks instead. What a waste of time I would never recommend them to anyone</Review>

Purchased my same OEM rims but in the gloss black powder coat from them for my BMW and they look awesome! Price was fair and shipping was fast.

Jan was excellent with customer service and communicated quickly back.

Definitely recommend!

Thanks!

<Text>Company provided prompt answers to questions, and recommended the perfect tire size. I was about to go 245 and they recommended 255. I was able to adjust my order in time !!! These folks are awesome. The wheels were perfect. They gleam just like the advertisement. You pay for quality, but it’s worth it. Thanks again.< /Text>< pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Jan and his team were stellar. I drove up from San Diego for a set of wheels for my GS 350, the fit of which wasn’t quite what I was looking for. We found another set that worked and I’m thrilled with the results. Enjoyed a nice chat with Jan and before I left, one or the service guys was heading out for lunch and offered to grab me something - that’s never happened before my many years of wheel purchasing/upgrading. I highly recommend!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

< review>
Jan and his team are by far the most professional, service oriented automotive business I have ever dealt with.   I was looking for options to black out my rims on my new Escalade; having never been through this process I was a little apprehensive.    I spoke with Jan over the phone and he gave me several options which included powder coating my existing rims or replacing my rims for similar OEM rims he had already powder coated and had in stock.   I arrived the same day and was in and out in about an hour; the rims on my Escalade look amazing!     While I waited, Jan answered all my questions, freely leant me his expertise and proved references to other great vendors who would help me complete my project with my Escalade.     Beyond the great product and service Jan is a “salt of the earth” type who can be trusted to always do right by his customers.
I will definitely be sending all my friends to Factory Wheel Republic !!< /review>

< Review>
I bought a set of used 20 inch AMG wheels for my 2017 Mercedes-benz GLE and I couldn't be happier. They shipped them SUPER FAST. I had tracking less than a half an hour after purchasing and they were delivered super fast from California. Jan is great, very helpful and super nice. The rims were gorgeous and in such good condition that I couldn't even tell they were used. They drastically made my GLE look so much nicer. I can't recommend Factory Wheel Republic enough. If you're looking for rims, this is the place to go!< /Review>

<Review>Ordered used wheels and tires online, was very impressed with condition of product and fast shipping. Company will send additional photos or information via text if desired. Wheels and tires were in great condition fully cleaned/detailed and TPMS sensors worked with my car. Shipped very fast and each wheel was individually wrapped to prevent any shipping damage. I would order from again, great prices too.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80dd27525d37af57:0xb1b891974c4bd52e< /Gmap_id></record>

Two transactions so far with the guys at factorywheelrepublic and only good things to say. I bought a set of 4 black wheels for my Tesla S and they came packaged well and in a timely manner, price was perfect for what I wanted and the customer service overall was exceptional. Second transaction was for a replacement of a rear wheel due to rogue partner curb rashing it and the same exceptional experience was had, I got an individual wheel reserved and paid for within 24 hours. Highly recommended!< /text>

<Review>Factorywheelrepublic is great. I Searched everywhere for my wheels and only FWR had exactly what I wanted. Jan from FWR was amazing. I had many questions and they took the time to answer everyone. They helped me out with a nice wheel package and had them delivered from CA to NY ASAP. The transaction and service was flawless.....👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾.<//Review>< Rating>

<review>I was looking for a set of wheels and Jan at Factory Wheel Republic had exactly what I was looking for. He responded instantly to my phone call and met me on the same day to buy the wheels. He is friendly, great to talk with and his team helped install them as well. Highly recommend.</review><gmapID>0x80dd27525d37af57:0xb1b891974c4bd52e< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Excellent service. Did a great job packing and shipping these wheels/tires across the country. They dont negotiate much on price, but based on the quality of the items they sell, you still get a GREAT value at the listed pricing.

I will absolutely recommend them to my friends and any future wheel/tire needs I have

Thanks FWR!< /text>

<Review>I purchased a Lamborghini wheel from FWR and prior to it leaving their facility, they contacted me to tell me that it had been unfortunately damaged. They were upfront and refunded my money back immediately and even offered to send me additional money for my troubles. Although we weren’t able to do business, I will 100% keep them in mind for the future and recommend them to everyone I know looking for OEM wheels!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dd27525d37af57:0xb1b891974c4bd52e< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>My car has been sitting at the shop for a few days and the price of rims from Mercedes was insane. From beginning to end the entire purchase process money and the quality of the rims were impeccable. Even had them shipped to me within 1 hour of buying. Had tracking numbers in hand and the product was 100% exactly as pictured and promised.</Review>< Response>

<text>IM SO HAPPY!!! The entire staff is friendly and professional. Just bought some AMAZING tires, a set of four 35" Firestone Destination MT2's for my JKU and they look great. Gives my jeep a new aggressive look. I thought the aggressive tread patterns were gonna cause some road noise but after leaving and getting on the freeway, you would think I had some street tires. No road noise at all!!! I highly recommend these mud terrains for any 4WD vehicle. I also highly recommend this Firestone as well. Thanks again everyone for your hard work!<//text>< gmap_id>

<Name>David Donaldson</Name><Time>1527185122033</Time><rate>1< /rate><text>Let me start this out by expressing my disgust with the  customer service at this Firestone. This issue is mainly focused on Jimmy. He is absolutely rude and condescending. Jimmy has no business dealing with customers and should at the very least receive some sort of training on how to deal with the public. His mannerisms and behavior are a disgrace to his organization and reflect the poor standards that Firestone holds for its staff. To my horror, Jimmy stated he is a store manager. Unacceptable.

My wife took in our Toyota Sienna for new tires and an alignment. She sat in the shop for two hours as the work was being done. Jimmy told my wife the alignment was done but the rear required shims to be aligned. He told her to find the parts, order them , then bring them back in and they would install them. To our puzzlement  a major tire brand such as Firestone does not have the ability to order or stock a very commonly used part for a very common vehicle. When questioned Jimmy said it is just how they do it. Thus a job was paid for and not completed. Firestone would rather my wife drive my children in a vehicle that is out of alignment and unsafe.

My wife asked for guidance in purchasing the shims and Jimmy reluctantly directed her to a site which the public cannot purchase parts from. Jimmy simply said it is not his problem. I called the shop from my work to get a better understanding of the situation. Jimmy was immediately rude and refused to help me stating, "I already showed your wife, do you expect me to go over it again." He could not and would not direct me to a place to purchase the parts. I asked why the services we paid for were not completed and he responded , "what, do expect me to order the parts for you." Yes Jimmy, I do. Any self respecting mechanic would acquire
whatever tools and parts needed for a job they were paid to complete.

As I questioned Firestone's practice of "this is how we have always done this" Jimmy then disconnected the phone call. He refused to even try to resolve the issue. I imagined that Firestone would be more concerned with their reputation. I now see that Firestone' s standards are nothing short of a gross disappointment and they have lost yet another customer. My hope is to dissuade others from spending their hard earned money in such a place.

A report will be filed with BAR.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Hard to find great costumer service with a unbeatable price. Competion was at least 14% higher and Derek went above and beyond what was asked for. Will definitely be returning when the time calls.< /Text>

Picked up a nail in front tire while visiting local attraction, Emerald Am took fantastic care of the problem.  In and out in about an hour.  Whole family waited in reception area, very comfortable, even grandson was entertained.  Would be happy to business with this store again.</Review>

We are a senior couple and were heading north to Reno, NV from San Diego when we stopped and noticed our rear passenger tire was going flat. It was late morning on Labor Day as we approached Lake Elsinore, CA. Not many businesses were open and most of the local gas stations were connected with convenience stores & didn't provide this type of repair service. As we drove around, we noticed the Firestone store was open and asked if it could be fixed. There were other people waiting for other repairs and only a couple of technicians on duty. The manager, Steve, immediately got us in and got our repair done as quickly as possible. He waived the bill and said  it was his special to us for the holiday even though we would have gladly paid it. He was such a nice young man and was very gracious.</Text>

I did have an issue with prompt and on time service. However, they were completely apologetic and took care of the issue without me asking for anything. The work was great, staff was EXTREMELY professional and customer oriented. I took 2 vehicles there and have nothing but positive remarks for them. My new maintenance location. Steve and Angela are awesome.<//Review>

They tried to fix our tire but the nail was in the side wall. Not a fixable flat. But they gave us a good deal on two tires. Nice that they are open on Sunday.<//Text>

Best place for tires, minor work. Nice people, too, just make an appt or prepare to wait. They do credit here, which helps a great deal with mid-month emergencies.< /review>

<review>I was hesitant of this place because of the horrible reviews but needed to get an oil change and tire rotation.  Made the appointment on Saturday at 12:35 asking if they were open Sunday.  The man then offered me two times on Sunday 12:00 or 1:00, I choose 1:00.  I drove an hour and a half to get there and I'm not on the books.  They tell me the number in my phone isn't even their number.  I was mistaken and must have called a different tire place.  I call the number I made the appointment with and their phone rings.  They then look me up and realize the appointment was made for the day I called in, which I would never do because I was working.  They were non apologetic what so ever, blamed me, then told me it would be until the end of the day to fit me in.  Super rude customer service.  Their mistake- they should have fit me in as I was even an hour early to my appointment time.  Their mistake on scheduling and absolutely no apology for the fact I drove an hour and a half for the appointment and plan on driving across the country the next day.   They actually said I was in the wrong because they didn't hear the conversation on the phone.

If they had been more apologetic and understanding on how customer service works instead of blaming me on what was their fault I wouldn't be upset.  I would avoid this place at all costs. I understand mistakes happen which was definitely their fault but blaming the customer on your poor mistake is awful business.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Called in for a quote on tires and the woman asked if she could call me back. I told her that would be fine, here is what I am looking for so when she calls me back she will already have the quote ready. Never called.... .Second incident; today I call, phone rings forever and finally a person answers (Mike or Miguel, can't remember) I asked if I could get a quote and got hung up on. So, two strikes your out.. just ordered from Tire Rack and will have a different tire shop mount and balance.</review>

Unfortunately I found those guys are not honest at all .They give you one year warranty for  alignment  .when you comes to re inspection they deal with you badly even if you got an appointment .Because you are not pay to them I see the technician working on another vehicle after starting and hanging  your vehicle on machine. I have an appointment 11:00 am ,I came on time finished all paper work  At 11:04 am.tell that moment the guy do some work on mine then go to do work in other one.that is actual and real happened next to me while I am  seeing that. If I am free how they calculate  the labor time for other customer and if it is already calculated according to the book either they wasting customer time or taking more money than usual.The put a label saying" I believe Fundamental honesty is the key stone for businesses ".
I do not advise any one to go there,I hope the that the website not hide my review. If they do so I will do what I see.
Is any one believe what they are saying???????!!!!!!!!!< /review>

<Review>Needed flat fixed. Mike tells me their tire machine is broken, new one won't be there for a week. I asked for the spare to be put on. Mike says the spare is over 5 years old and they won't put it on. Then he tells me to just keep airing it up for a week and then bring it back and they will fix for free. I inform Mike they are Firestone tires and I have paid for road hazard. Picked up my truck. Got up this am and tire is completely flat. Bought at least 3 sets of tires here.Will not EVER go back!!!</Review>< rate>

<Text>Had a good visit for my alignment. Came in about 10 mind early for an appointment so they could get my info and my car in on time. Got here and have received great customer service and was constantly updated on the status of my vehicle. In and out on about an hour, not to bad. Gave 4 stars do to initially being on hold about 10 mins to setup an appointment and had to call back plus they didn't get my car in on time (about 15 mins late) do to another alignment job being difficult so not totally blaming them for that.<//Text>< Pictures>

The worst firestone ever. I have done business with firestone all my life. The manager that they put in lake elsinore is rude and not professional.  I was a manager at a firestone before and the manager in this store will lie to you about your car. They broke the studs on my wheels and said I did it somewhere else. When I had proof they worked on my car last time. And the manager was a term and laughed and told me to go somewhere else. The last manager was great. But firestone is going down hill. Now I go to another firestone somewhere else and take the car to other shops. They lost a lot of my business and my complete family. Pepeboys always greets me well and gives me good service.</Text>

Spent $1,200 on a brake job that included expensive brake pads and ROTORS on all four wheels.  22,000 miles later, grinding from the back wheels and needed to replace both the pads and the rotors.  STAY AWAY!<//Review>

I appreciate Mickey the Receptionist & Bobby the security guard for looking out & making sure me & my gf visit was safe & efficient.

This location by far the best of all of JB vendor locations in SoCal. I live minutes from the DTLA locations, but prefer to come to this location instead... T Swizz & other staff including security are super polite, curbside pickup system is organized (and nice to have), and location itself is always in great shape.< /review>

<Review>The weed they offer here are so high in quality its hard to pick a favorite. The only thing that's not letting me put 5 stars is that the weed Is quite expensive, but you're paying for quality which they have.<//Review>< Pics>

I always like to call a dispensary before I go because most places always rush you around. Face to face interaction is premium, so making sure you have someone that wants people to visit is a plus. I was able to ask Ashely questions, and she took the time to answer me and even give additional information. Her customer service was excellent, and I'm excited to visit.< /review>

Pacing of the line, check-in, menu explanation could be better but these are trying times.

Overall it was a pleasant experience. The interior was, "a clean, well-lighted place," that made me feel welcome. The displays were engaging and informative, as were the bud-tenders. I'll be heading back, although I'd prefer a more thorough explanation of the, "tiers," and a way to feel less like I'm being bounced around the store while I look at various strains, on my next visit.

Don't forget your rec!</text>

I used to love this place, but they are not that restaurant anymore. Poor standards and even worse management. I was told that my bisque was supposed to have large shell pieces. My Oysters shell were partially broken, and shell was  mixed with the meat. The manager did give me that one. Terrible experience.  I wonder if I should have brought a group. I was treated much better when I brought my family.<//text>

<text>This food was incredible! I will definitely be back. We came for a weekend trip and decided to have Sunday brunch on the warf. Best decision ever. The food presentation was artistic and Beautiful! The aroma was incredible. The smoked trout was to die for. It was smoothe and buttery in texture and the smoke on it was perfect. The crab bisque was creamy and had a smokey flavor to it which I loved.  The clams in the chowder were very tender and fresh which we enjoyed with the deliciousand fresh sourdough. My favorite dish however was the Salmon and crab cake Benedict. My eggs were cooked to perfection and the cake was the best I have ever had. There is definitely something to be said about eating fresh seafood right on the warf. The only thing that could have made my experience better would have been to watch the fishing boats unloading at the docks but it was Sunday. We did however get a lovely visit from a few Sea Lions. Couldn't have asked for a better experience on our trip.<//text>< pictures>

Excellent quick service, I had a reservation but was able to be seated sooner than our appointed time. The food was fresh,not surprised since we are right by the water. Fried calamari had a perfect consistency of batter, texture and flavor. I had to try the crab cake sandwich, I was not disappointed in the moist and crispy cake on a beautiful brioche bun they served me. I had a crack in my glass, I alerted the waiter to prevent any accidents/messes, he replaced the glass and beverage right away. I had to pass on the dessert, I was much too full to proceed. I recommend this place to anyone trying to have a peaceful dinner with terrific service. The price is also great for the quality of food.</Text>

Amazing food. Friendly service.

My friend and I sat at the bar and had a marvelous experience. The bartender Kyler couldn't be friendlier. He recommended the right tequilas and meal.

The crab cakes were perfect. The gambas al ajillo (shrimp) was divine. The hanger steak with chimichurri sauce was grilled to perfection.

A San Francisco institution that has adapted with the times. Kudos to Scoma’s for keeping the show going with great to go food and beverage. The out door dining options are really great now, especially if the weather is nice. The hosts, bartenders, wait staff and kitchen are all very kind and smiling. The food quality is really great and the prices are reasonable. Always fresh amazing g quality fish and seafood. The chowder and crab bisque are amazing. The calamari is a favorite. The sourdough is on point. Make sure to stop by especially if the weather is nice. Make a rez if you don’t want to wait but waiting around with a drink soaking in the scene ain’t so bad. Spicy margarita is excellent. Thanks!<//review>

Food favorites - definitely recommend the crab cakes and clam chowder! Both were amazing.

Experience - staff was really friendly and it was so nice to sit outside and enjoy the views. The patio is dog friendly which was perfect for our pup! Service was a little slow at times but we were busy most of the time in good company.

Price - coming from Chicago I thought things were slightly overpriced here, even for seafood but maybe that’s normal to the area.

Overall would recommend!< /review>

The hostess informed us the bayside view was a bit windy so we sat on the other side which was quiet, pleasant and felt more private. Our waiter was so friendly and checked on us often. We also ordered starters; calamari fritters and a cup of clam chowder. Couldn’t take a picture fast enough before we dug in but it was so good.

<Text>Made reservations online for this well-respected joint. Wanted a drink, maybe a snack.

Upon arrival, we were snottily informed that they don't do reservations for drinks. We were sat in a disused section, apparently the "seats of shame".

As we sat and sipped our drinks (15 minutes of a wait for those), we watched the main outdoor dining section. Not only was it not full, but it continued to empty as we sat.

Had the front desk jockey been kinder, we would have had more to drink and even snacks. Who knew that restaurants would be in a hurry to mistreat customers after being closed for so long?< /Text>< Pics>

You won't need to be concerned about finding a parking space. They have a large parking lot where more customers can be accommodated. For me, this has been a once-in-a-lifetime chance. All will enjoy this novel. The cost of food and other items is reasonable.< /Text>

Make a reservation for this place, to sit indoors. The food is outstanding. Even sitting outside in the cold, the food was good but the cold temperatures of springtime makes you think twice about staying outdoors to eat.<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>This food was incredible! I will definitely be back. We came for a weekend trip and decided to have Sunday brunch on the warf. Best decision ever. The food presentation was artistic and Beautiful! The aroma was incredible. The smoked trout was to die for. It was smoothe and buttery in texture and the smoke on it was perfect. The crab bisque was creamy and had a smokey flavor to it which I loved.  The clams in the chowder were very tender and fresh which we enjoyed with the deliciousand fresh sourdough. My favorite dish however was the Salmon and crab cake Benedict. My eggs were cooked to perfection and the cake was the best I have ever had. There is definitely something to be said about eating fresh seafood right on the warf. The only thing that could have made my experience better would have been to watch the fishing boats unloading at the docks but it was Sunday. We did however get a lovely visit from a few Sea Lions. Couldn't have asked for a better experience on our trip.< /Review>< pics>

You should give it a shot! It's one of my favorite restaurants in town, and it's the best, in my opinion. The food was delicious, and the service was superb. It was well worth the ride!< /Review>

< Review>
Food favorites - definitely recommend the crab cakes and clam chowder! Both were amazing.

Experience - staff was really friendly and it was so nice to sit outside and enjoy the views. The patio is dog friendly which was perfect for our pup! Service was a little slow at times but we were busy most of the time in good company.

Price - coming from Chicago I thought things were slightly overpriced here, even for seafood but maybe that’s normal to the area.

Overall would recommend!</Review>

< Review>
A San Francisco institution that has adapted with the times. Kudos to Scoma’s for keeping the show going with great to go food and beverage. The out door dining options are really great now, especially if the weather is nice. The hosts, bartenders, wait staff and kitchen are all very kind and smiling. The food quality is really great and the prices are reasonable. Always fresh amazing g quality fish and seafood. The chowder and crab bisque are amazing. The calamari is a favorite. The sourdough is on point. Make sure to stop by especially if the weather is nice. Make a rez if you don’t want to wait but waiting around with a drink soaking in the scene ain’t so bad. Spicy margarita is excellent. Thanks!<//Review>

<text>If you are looking for fresh and great tasting fish and seafood, look no further. This restaurant has earned its reputation.

The service is very good and traditional. The waiting staff are very informative and explain the menu, especially making sure you are aware of what has been caught that day.

The cocktails are also amazing.</text>< gmapID>

Great lunch! The food was very good. I love the grilled shrimp and catfish. We went by boat, which is a fantastic thing to do. Service was friendly and efficient.

We had a great experience at Fisherman's Wharf.<//Text>

Delicious food and efficient, friendly service. The hostess informed us the bayside view was a bit windy so we sat on the other side which was quiet, pleasant and felt more private. Our waiter was so friendly and checked on us often. We also ordered starters; calamari fritters and a cup of clam chowder. Couldn’t take a picture fast enough before we dug in but it was so good. We will absolutely come back to try more options.</review>

Wonderful date place! Weird ally location with a gorgeous marina, overpriced weak ,measured cocktails...only the Manhattan and Martini have ,what I would call, a booze forward sotuation.The menu is ALL seafood. Except for truffle parmesan fries. Very old and famous. And, wow..what a view! If you want a 200 dinner, this is your spot! Dont ask to plug in your cell phone..there is a rule that says No! Hilarious bonus, you can usually park there.....down the Ally, pass the marina..bang a left..and BAM....you get to park. Ay su set there is a fabulous seagull show on the roof as above the trash cans.</text>

Good choice for seafood along the wharf. The classic design and more mature staff lend an air of authenticity beyond some of the other restaurants nearby. I enjoyed the clam chowder, which was rich and full of little morsels of clam. Similarly, the crab thermidor was packed with chunks of crab. It was served with a rich, creamy sauce and served on a bed of orzo. However, the citrus flavor was a little bit strong for my palette.< /Text>

Some beautiful outside seating here. What a view! Enjoyed a bottle of Albirino from Spain. Crisp white light wine. Perfect for a warm day. We shared calamari, crab cakes, beet salad and clams on garlic toast    Every item was delicious. And our server this sweet native of France was so delightful.</text>

I tried the mixed seafood grill. Very good fish, especially the shrimps, among the best I ever had. Service was very good and I didn’t have to wait for a table since I chose the cocktail lounge. 4 stars because is a bit overpriced for the amount (39$). Plus there is a 4% gratuity on top of normal tipping.</review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>With so many of the iconic restaurants in the heart of the tourist area closed I was lucky to find Scoma. Sat indoors in the dining room. It was intimate and well appointed. Service!  This was old world service. I can't remember the last time I had service this attentive to detail and my dining experience. The food was excellent. The dining selection is broad and the Chardonnay I selected was perfect. The food was excellent. Scallops were expertly seared, shrimp cocktail was delicious, risotto was just right, dessert snd coffee were an indulgent experience. I loved the entire experience and highly recommend this treasure just steps away from the commercial clatter of the high traffic tourist spots.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Like most places in Fisherman's Wharf, well overpriced. However, the food is good and the atmosphere is great. Slightly upmarket, but if you want a nice Italian seafood restaurant in the local area, this place fits the bill.< /review>

This is one of the top restaurants I’ve ever been to and definitely our favorite from our San Francisco trip.  Absolutely everything our party of 11 ordered we loved. You can’t go wrong with any of their dishes.

The service was also impeccable.  If you’re a dessert person try the seven layer cake.

Their seafood is top notch but if you’re a red meat fan their steak was also extremely good.<//review>

<rate>4</rate><text>It had been over six months since I had had a meal at a restaurant or made a reservation. With the sun shining, the idea of enjoying a cold crab salad overlooking the water appealed to me. Plus it's a nice image thinking of Al Scoma creating a family business 50+ years ago and having a pier named after him. Could such a story unfold for a scrappy go-getter these days?

We were a few minutes early for our lunch reservation, so we took the time to enjoy the view of the water and the mosaic ode to the city outside. Definitely easy to appreciate on a warm day. A few minutes later, we were seated at a picnic style table and received sourdough bread and whipped butter, and glasses of ice water.

Unfortunately, one of the glasses had remnants of red lipstick on it. We brought it to our server's attention, and later on, he replaced our water. Without a word, he took the glass and walked away. I couldn't help thinking it would have been nice if he had shown some sign of remorse. I understand that dishwashers can leave behind residue, but given these especially germaphobic times, a little sign of concern for the patrons from the staff goes a long way.

$13 Crab Bisque Bowl:
This orange bowl had a creamy tomato flavor with chunks of crab meat, topped with chives and cracked pepper.

$21 Scoma's Dungeness Crab Cake:
A pair of lightly battered and fried crab medallions were served with a small portion of arugula salad on the side and some creamy dipping salad. The crab was still chunky, which was definitely a plus, because that definitely beats crab cakes with pulverized crab mush.

$47 Scoma's Crab Louis Salad "Classic" 1/2 lb:
I knew the Crab Louis was going to be a large portion, even with the smaller "Classic" sized portion, but when I saw the plate set down in front of me, I knew we would have leftovers. The pile of crab meat sat on top of shredded lettuce, decked out with juicy heirloom tomatoes, cucumber slices, a boiled egg, bell peppers, carrots, olives, lemon wedges, and a ramekin overflowing with Louis dressing. It was cool and refreshing, not to mention the crab and the accoutrements were sweet and satisfying. My only complaint was I would have preferred if the carrot were peeled, because the outer layers looked a touch hairy.
I happily packed up the leftovers and looked forward to digging into it for my next meal. Our server joked that we did a good effort, but ate too much of the salad, haha.

I thoroughly enjoyed the food, and I probably would have enjoyed it even more if I had the opportunity to witness seeing the 'Pier to Plate' process unfold. I would rate my experience a 7/10, and would be more of a solid 4/5 had it not been for the dirty glasses. I wish I could say that I will save myself the money and make my own Crab Louis, but I sure do appreciate someone else shelling all that crab.<//text>< Pics>

Seafood was fresh. Pasta was ok tasting but came in huge portions - if you are a small eater, one between two people is enough. Clam chowder was delicious.

Service was great.

<rate>5</rate><Text>A great restaurant a little off the beaten path on Fisherman's Wharf. That is they own their own boats and seafood processing facility across the street. Excellent seafood prepared extremely well! By the way they also make craft cocktails including a Bloody Mary made with house made gin. There are so many places to choose from but even at lunch hour in the middle of the week, this restaurant is very busy. Scoma's was recommended by our cabbie a lifelong resident of San Francisco. Locals surely know it and we were happy that we followed his advice.< /Text>< pics>

Delicious Fish n Chips!  The batter is made the traditional way. The food is made fresh by order. The portions are generous. My daughter and I shared one order and it was plenty to eat.

Picnic tables are available for seating in front.

This place is a nice addition to the Fisherman's Wharf eateries!< /Review>

This place is amazing. The best seafood I have ever had. It's a bit pricey, but it's worth it because the food is fresh. The waiter also put a bib on me because I had white shirt on. Lol. The lazy man is what I ordered and def would recommend this place to all.<//Review>

Well we thought we were going to have a nice dinner experience for our 17th yr anniversary but what we got was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had, we were seated in an area where the doors were open its was super cold that we had to wear our coats while dining, when asked if we could have an empty boothe we were refused and were told this was all that was available, hummm that's funny the boothe was left empty the whole time we were there, i don't get it me and my wife pick this establishment for our anniversary dinner and informed them threw our reservation, totally no thought as to seat us to enjoy the experience, the frist drinks were their mule drink that tasted like medicine had to spit out and refuse them.the limes were like old and dried like it had been left out in the sun ,in closing this is not anywhere near a five star restaurant, i would never ever eat there nor suggest it to anyone. I we don't mind paying for anything as long as you get what you pay for .....🙁👎👎👎</Text>

<Review>We were in seafood heaven! Both the seafood entree and mains were mouth-watering and divine. We couldn't get enough! They matched well with a local chardonnay and the Pisco Punch cocktail. To top it off we had the delicious tiramisu. It was a perfect evening at Scoma's - delightful ambience with excellent and attentive service. Hands down the best meal we had on this trip!
Tip: Make a reservation to avoid waiting for a table (even on a week night) as this place is very busy.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGpvRHOJwjCAA9RD_A_1XFf9ZU2JMR6lKrpfNj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTk3M49lySfuHJ8RoPpzC3U5Mhh02hxELhTGzo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNS_nekznhaAErQwucxlKSTZRgAvHCy5GFe8Oa6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOI5O9_GUZDFrZDpYAeYZ0xxCvlqbcWwFdxacMG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTIElCZpOsIDtDQigRKk5y2kV9KrCvEZN8fgrK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhbU3Y4NWGM6GVyiQVIvQAluKNheXFmbkd0asz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

FYI, for those looking for post-Covid updates: they have converted part of their parking lot into ocean front dining with 6 feet between each table.

Highly recommended!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>This place is very rustic and classic! Great place with excellent food! We ordered their shrimp, squid, and crab fried rice. It was so delicious! The taste was amazing and unique in flavors. This is our new favorite Thai restaurant in the city. They also have a unique design and excellent service. I will definitely come back and have that charcoal baby octopuses. Tasty!</Review>< Pics>

<rate>2</rate><review>What's good: Clamp chowder soup is delicious and crab was well cooked that maintains the freshness. Great stuff.

Mediocre... Oyster was not fresh. Definitely not worth the money.

What's bad:  Very disappointed with the freshness of the mussels. Filled with ammonia taste.

What's unacceptable: Do not appreciate the jokes of  the waiter who took our order.. sounded condescending to me.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Seafood was fresh. Pasta was ok tasting but came in huge portions - if you are a small eater, one between two people is enough. Clam chowder was delicious.

Service was great. The seating was a bit small so it was not that comfortable.<//Text>< Pictures>

With so many of the iconic restaurants in the heart of the tourist area closed I was lucky to find Scoma. Sat indoors in the dining room. It was intimate and well appointed. Service!  This was old world service. I can't remember the last time I had service this attentive to detail and my dining experience. The food was excellent. The dining selection is broad and the Chardonnay I selected was perfect. The food was excellent. Scallops were expertly seared, shrimp cocktail was delicious, risotto was just right, dessert snd coffee were an indulgent experience. I loved the entire experience and highly recommend this treasure just steps away from the commercial clatter of the high traffic tourist spots.</Review>

What An AMAZING Experience! My mom and I just finished what I believe to be the best service we have ever had! From the moment we walked into Scoma’s to the moment we left, we were treated with the most warm and wonderful service. The food (fresh caught) was unbelievable! Please do yourself a favour and just order the Crab, hot, in garlic and lemon butter! You will feel like you’re floating on a cloud. I would like to say Thanks again to Our phenomenal server David, you are one of a kind. We will most definitely be back for many years to come!< /Review>

My girlfriend and I were visiting SF and in one place this restaurant was highly recommended to us.  It was a shame to have such a bad experience despite how beautiful this place looks.  The first thing was the poor attention of the waitress, she took the order three meters away, I had to choose a little voice to take my order, besides that she had no interest in explaining the menus well.  Then my girlfriend asked for a salmon and it was raw, this situation was very unpleasant, they offered us to reconcile it but she did not want to continue eating, not even the waitress herself apologized.  not if all this had to do with the time I decided to go, it was like 8:00 pm.  My girlfriend went to the bathroom and it was very dirty.  the truth is that all this is a shame for this well located place.  Hopefully it will improve a bit since the services are not cheap at all, I find it expensive and of very low quality.  I think I would think twice to return here.<//text>

<review>Excellent dinner spot. I'm still salavating looking at my salad from this evening. If you find yourself in San Francisco, then Scoma's is an excellent restaurant that I highly recommend.

Pictured here is the Roasted Beet Salad (Salt Roasted Red and Golden Beets withAvocado, Orange, Aged Balsamic & Fresh Horseradish) along with the Halibut and veggies.</review>< Time>

<Text>Be prepared to spend some money here. Ask for the DIPLOMATICO plate which they removed from the menu but still make it. It was a wonderful experience.<//Text>< Pictures>

Enjoyed the fresh cod. The lemon aioli was amazing! The “seasonal vegetables” on the plate was a frozen diced veggie blend. A little to be desired for the price point. But overall a good experience. Lovely sunset dinner over the Bay; much quieter and less crowded than Pier 39.< /text>

A friend suggested this restaurant to me and I'm so glad she did! First of all, the staff was amazing. They were very friendly and, helpful with suggestions.
Had an amazing margarita to start and had the trio for 2 as an appetizer which includes, calamari, crabcakes and bacon wrapped scallops. Now I am usually not a fan of seafood beyond calamari but the crabcakes were amazing and came with a delicious dipping sauce. Also had a delicious caesar salad.
I had the filet as an entree with asparagus with lemon and it was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. One of the best dinners I've had in quite a while.< /text>

Very cozy! Great views of SF in any direction. Believe it or not I’m a 40 year old man who had never eaten an oyster in his life, that all changed at Scoma. I was wary but they were delightful! If you’re up this way doing that tourist thing AND you live seafood, then this right here is your spot!< /Review>< Pics>

Been coming here for years. I like this place better than the Sausalito location. We celebrated our 38yr anniversary. My wife wanted to eat here. Cesar salad,  Crab Brisq soup, spicy sauteed calamari, Lazy man's Cioppino and Cod special!!! All was YUM!!! LOL< /Review>

<Text>Very fresh seafood that they say is sourced from the local fishermen and fisheries. They're generous with the butter and everything is consistent. The first time I came here, I had the louie salad, which was extremely basic. My latest return I tried out their seafood pastas and it was so rich I could die. Definitely something you need lots of bread for, but worth trying. Interior is a little bit nautical and storied with the waiters being attentive and checking in often. It's a bit on a the pricier side, but worth the price.<//Text><name>Andrew Jaru< /name><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNl5-gP5pw8G25mkaR6WggC_ASHDitmtX9yhG99=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

<user_id>113357668924380870444</user_id><Text>Fantastic service, fantastic food and large serving sizes.
Good conversation with the serving staff too.

Small 15-20min wait for a walk in customer, which was fine. It allowed us to have a couple of drinks at one of the 2 front bars in the meantime prior to our meal.

Would recommend.< /Text>< username>

Scoma's has the best crab Louie salad I have ever had anywhere. Their seafood is the freshest, purchased right off the boats steps away from the kitchen. Atmosphere was absolutely amazing. The scallops were perfection as was the calamari. Would definitely recommend this restaurant.< /text>< Pics>

<review>Everything is fantastic at Scoma's. This is a must if you are in San Francisco, excellent Clam chowder, Caesar salad, and freshest sea food you can get. We love it here, family favorite!

Easy to walk to. It's tucked away from the per noise. The atmosphere reminded me of old San Francisco, dark wood, nice comfy bar stools.

The food and service was Great. And they were able to accommodate the large party of diners that were in attendance with us. Definitely recommend reservations. The food was excellent, the wine selection was superb, and the service was efficient and professional. Highly recommend.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>I've eaten here twice in this trip and both times the food and service were fantastic.
The second time we enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching the interactions between the staff who truly seem like a family - with some waiters driving 2 hours to work there!
Candace and Steve behind the bar deserve a big shout out, looking after us, keeping us entertained and giving us Thanksgiving weekend recommendations :)</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBbyKpMZeRidG0a0l9kAg3sHwtW3AYoc3RgG6o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcA0EiUXYlyNcDJjQeajRHwpJzbccfGn7bBL64=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtt7ZRLZrBt7frx7WCksbmnA2KbDC9QrJJ5scv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

I love this place. Quintessential San Fran seafood spot. 3rd time here. Waiters are all very professional and provide the best service.

Fantastic seafood and cool location off the beaten path a little and in a boat harbor.

I like the intimate atmosphere. Make your reservations WEEKS in advance.

If you have never been here... you really should try it.</review>

On a work trip after a full day. We ate dinner here. It was one of the few dining options available to get us out of our hotel room.

They had extra tables setup where parking used to be. So we ate outside. The view was awesome. The service was top notch.

Drinks. Delicious. I had the smoked maple old fashioned. My dining mate (and friend and coworker) had a Southern Comfort and 7up.

Dinner (we couldn't fit dessert) was the grilled king salmon over Scomaronia and the Cioppino.

We ordered a couple apps too. Dungeness crab, oysters and shrimp. All good. All gone.

We so enjoyed our dinner here!

Thank you team Scoma!!

Hopefully you are able to get a new boat soon!!<//Review>

If you want to have a good seafood experience not in the 'tourist' area, this is your go place! The food is great and the atmosphere too. But be aware it is a 'posh' place, a bit expensive (around 50 dollars per person) and it is advisable to make a reservation.< /review>

<Text>Kinda hidden from the Main Street, Scoma's is a restaurant that you need to go!
I'm the kind of person who says don't like fish, but after trying it here I change my mind!!! The worst part is that now, anything thAt I taste will always be comparable to this one!!!
Highly recommended!<//Text>< Pics>

This place is an icon and for good reason. Always fresh seafood and great servers.  The bar is wonderful too. My favorite dish is the Cioppino. So much food and so flavorful.

Always busy so reservations are important.</text>

Our first visit to San Francisco and Scoma's came highly recommended. It did not disappoint....it was fantastic!  John, our waiter, was terrific.  Gave us some great wine, appy, dinner and after dinner specialty drinks suggestions.  We went with pretty well everything John recommended and we were not disappointed. Terrific service...fantastic food and drinks! Thank you John and a big applause to the chef and staff in the kitchen.....we'll be back!

Thank you!

<Rate>4<//Rate><username>David Trinh<//username><Time>1535211129302</Time><text>Waiting about an hour on a weekday evening to be seated for dinner. Extremely busy restaurant which impacts the service quality. The service was decent but they could do better.

Food:
Cioppino: generous amounts of fresh dungeness crab, clams, shrimp, scallops, squid, and mussels in a fresh tomato sauce. The thing that suprised me was it was pretty much all seafood and loads of it. The tomato sauce was quite plain though.

Oysters alla Scoma: rockafeller style with cheese. A bit too sour for me but my buddy enjyoed it.

Scoma’s Famous Clam chowder: solid chowder and nice junks of seafood but I’ve had better in SF

Overall a nice experience and loved the fresh seafood.<//text>< UserId.>

Well, so far best fried calamares! Scallops and fried shrimps was super good, even the rice as a side dish was super tasty! This is an old school place, where waiters know how to get the job done and they are very “familiar with the subjects”😉.<//Text>

My boyfriend had a few requests for his birthday dinner.  He wanted seafood, and to be near the water, at preferably an Italian restaurant. Did I forget to mention he has NCGS- non celiac gluten sensitivity. My quest to meet those demands led me to Scomas. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. My boyfriend had the Wild "Troll-Caught" Alaskan Salmon with
Whole Roasted Carrots, Asparagus, Shelled Peas, and asparagus Purée which was gluten free, and I had the Prawns and Scallops alla Gannon, with asparagus, spinach and rice. We also ordered mixed Shellfish Platter for two. Everything was delicious, and my bf enjoyed his birthday.< /Review>

Not worth it. The view from the dining room is not that great. The chowder is decent. The calamari didn’t taste fresh and had a thick batter on it. Prices were very high. The kids burger was decent but you can get one just as good at in n out for a 1/3 of the price. This is an old school place with old school food. If that’s what you like then you’ll probably like it but if your a millennial then it’s not your jam.</text>

<text>I have deliberated greatly whether to give it 3 or 4 stars.  The ambience is cozy and location is 5 stars and entering this delightful blue and white cottage you're transported to a time when you would be served something wonderful straight from the trawler at the "old" fisherman's wharf. I ordered the spaghetti marinara, my husband the mixed grill and my kids each ordered the fish and chips. I will declare I am Italian so perhaps I'm being harsh... but i thought my food was so so. The portions were very generous and no one left hungry but the food itself, not spectacular.  The service so so and I'm being generous. Perhaps it's because we brought the kids (not exactly a family restaurant) or maybe because we didn't order alcohol but i just felt we got average, perfunctory service. This is what really let it down for us. We ended up tipping 30% anyway ... but we wont be back. Sorry.< /text></record>

Restaurant had a old school feel to it. We had a trio appetizer plate and mixed seafood dinner. The scallops, crab cake, and fried calamari was a great stater. The mixed seafood was a good dish to share, but some of the fish seemed a bit overcooked/dry. Overall great atmosphere and dinner would way here again when in SF.</Text>

I was looking for a nice place to eat on the bay, but the restaurants on Fisherman's Wharf looked way too touristic to me. I opted for this more hidden restaurant and I've been positively surprised. First, the staff is super friendly and welcoming. Then the atmosphere, very "marine" with all the wood. Last but not least, the food is great! Fresh fish from the bay, with many different options available. Wasn't expecting this quality. Sure, is not the cheapest option around, but if you want to eat well this i's the place to go!< /Text>

<Review>Food was very good and very high quality.  Be prepared to wait a while unless you have reservations.  It’s not cheap in any sense - food and cocktails are outrageously priced.  But you knew that already :-)  would’ve given it 5 stars, however two out of three dishes needed salt DESPERATELY.  I know salt is subjective, but as someone that does a lot of cooking I feel like the cook didn’t use any on those dishes.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Everything is fantastic at Scoma's. This is a must if you are in San Francisco, excellent Clam chowder, Caesar salad, and freshest sea food you can get. We love it here, family favorite!

Easy to walk to. It's tucked away from the per noise. The atmosphere reminded me of old San Francisco, dark wood, nice comfy bar stools.

The food and service was Great. And they were able to accommodate the large party of diners that were in attendance with us. Definitely recommend reservations. The food was excellent, the wine selection was superb, and the service was efficient and professional. Highly recommend.< /Review>< pictures>

No frills, except for the food. The food was fresh, uniquely prepared, and absolutely delicious. The atmosphere is authentic and worn; I wouldnt have it any other way.< /review>

I would give this place NO STARS if the site would let me!

Up until tonight, I always loved this place. In fact, I had made a commitment to patronize local restaurants that remained open during the Shelter in Place order to help them during this crisis. Scoma's was one of those places. I had ordered "curbside delivery" a couple of times, no problem. Drive up, someone comes out, takes your card, goes inside and runs the check, and then comes right back with your bill to sign and your bag of food. And away you go. I might add that the service was always masked and gloved.

So tonight, I called in an order, arrived in my car at the time I said I would be there. Someone was there to tell me where to park, and there I sat with absolutely no acknowledgement from the staff inside for the next 15 minutes! Meanwhile, there was a birthday party going on right in front of me, and they received two full food deliveries while I was sitting there!

The same parking guy walked by again and I finally got his attention. He went in to check on my order, and a girl came and informed me that I had to COME INSIDE AND PAY to get my order - OH REALLY? SINCE WHEN? What happened to the "curbside delivery" that you have advertised on your website, and that I've patronized at least twice without any problem? She then informed me that it was because I called my order in rather than ordering online - RIGHT! I called my orders before without any problems, so I knew that wasn't it. She finally admitted that they were busy - evidently too busy to handle the transaction as advertised. OK, well then I'm too busy to be your customer! I told her to skip it and drove away without my order.

So this is how you treat your neighborhood patrons who were loyal to you during the SIP? Suddenly the SIP order's relaxed and  you're letting people into your restaurant to order and pay, and people are standing around in the parking lot, less than six feet apart and no masks, partying and getting all your service. I see. And now I hope some of my neighbors will see, too. SHAME ON YOU. If that's how you're going to treat loyal customers, then you will never get my business again. SHAME. ON. YOU!< /review>

{'time': 1592259196011, 'text': "Hi Stefanie. Thank you so much for your kind words on always loving us and we greatly appreciate your efforts to support us during the SIP. We're happy to know your two initial curbside delivery experiences went so well, but please accept our apologies for the items you described on your most recent visit. We looked into what happened there and unfortunately it was a perfect storm of getting slammed and not having the proper training for the staff that was on hand at the time. We do happily offer curbside service and do handle the transactions as advertised. It will not happen again. Next time you order or come by, please introduce yourself so we can apologize in person and make sure you have a 100% perfect experience. Thank you and we look forward to serving you again."}</Resp>

<Text>Delicious food, great staff. If you don't know what to get try the seafood cioppino. A tasty classic. There are nice view of the harbor boats from the restaurant. I ate at the bar are the service was professional and friendly. The bar tender showed me the menu and popular items. There is a lot to choose from and I was unsure and he recommended a few items. When I tried to add an app he suggested an alternative because it would simply be too much crab meat. He did so curteously and I'm glad I followed his advice. Valet parking is available if you are driving.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqcauR7eitcBEe5UJMyUDIy-zfLm2tMrbwDqSy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Gmap_id>

Was told this was the place to go for seafood in San Francisco. The wife and I went during a recent trip and even at 2pm in the afternoon, there was a wait. We both ordered the crab and even though it was messy, it was a fun experience.< /Review>

<text>Food decent, not great. Had a nice view and a touristy thing to do, which happened completely out of hunger and at the wrong place at the right time. Fisherman's wharf reminds me of what Key West has become of endless tshirt shops with people accosting you like they would in the 90's walking down 42nd street in NY. Could have done without stopping there at all but we needed some touristy kids gifts...like tshirts.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>This restaurant shares the pier with fishing boats (that also pay rent) and park here so that we can all get fresh fish. It's a pier after all. Now they want to stop the boats from being there and that's very unfair. These are hard times for everyone we all need to innovate and yes they might need some more outdoor space but also be reasonable and share. I would like to hear a reasonable explanation from the new management.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1592089091527, 'text': 'Catherine, please know Scoma\'s is perhaps the biggest supporter of the local fishing fleet in the entire city. We are more than happy to have any fishing boat being on the pier and several do. We have been letting FV Pioneer sell seafood in our parking lot, which we pay for, at no cost to them. We have no ability, desire or authority to put anyone out of business, and the Pioneer could easily move to a different slip if it wanted to.\n\nIt is an unfortunate situation but we have well over 100 employees, many local fishing crews and countless farmers whose livelihoods depend on our being able to conduct business. After offering several solutions to the FV Pioneer no agreement could be reached.\n\nPlease read this unbiased statement from the Port of San Francisco if you are interested in knowing the facts of the situation.\n\nThank you for your feedback we we hope this response and the Port\'s statement below gives you clarity on the situation.\n\nStatement issued by the Port of San Francisco yesterday:\n\n"This is a COVID-19 public safety issue now that Scoma’s can offer outdoor dining on their leasehold. Moreover, FV Pioneer has no claim to operate retail fish sales on property that Scoma’s leases.\n\nScoma’s voluntarily agreed to allow a portion of their leasehold to be temporarily used since 2017 without costs to FV Pioneer for retail fish sales as a good neighbor supporting local fishers. Otherwise, the FV Pioneer would not have been able to operate a fish retail business without the cooperation of Scoma’s and the Port.\n\nScoma’s can no longer accommodate FV Pioneer retail fish sales on its property due to health and social distancing guidelines. The City has offered new opportunities for restaurants, whose doors have been shuttered for the past three months, to operate outdoor dining in efforts to stem the financial hardship that the virus has caused on the restaurant industry.\n\nScoma’s and FV Pioneer attempted to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. As no solution has presented itself, the Port must support Scoma’s claims to use the property they are leasing from the Port. Thus, the FV Pioneer can berth there but it may no longer make retail sales."\n\nFor additional information please contact the Port of San Francisco Public Affairs Office.'}< /Response>

<user_name>Scott<//user_name><text>I'm a local, and I eat on the San Francisco waterfront often. This is definitely one of the best meals I've had near the Pier 39 / fisherman's wharf area.

Fried calamari was very good, although it could have been just a touch more crispy.

Crispy fries with truffle oil and parmesan cheese were out of this world.

The beet salad was small for the price, but tasted amazing.

The bread roll tasted fresh, but it was not warm.

Service was fast and friendly. I was dining alone and I got one of the tables facing out toward the fishing boats.

The location makes this one of those places that you will not stumble onto. You must see the sign and walk toward the Bay down the pier.

The restaurant is like time stopped in 1965, but it's clean and well-maintained inside.

food is expensive, but not over-the-top expensive. I ordered three appetizers, calamari, crispy fries, and the beet salad. And with two diet Pepsi's it came to $51, before tip.

I will definitely be back here.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and service. Mid week we were able to get in without a reservation but I think any other time it would be prudent. The beet salad was light and tasty. We shared a seafood stew with a side of polenta that I highly recommend for enjoying the delicious tomato-based broth. The seafood tasted fresh and was perfectly cooked.< /review>

i dined here one evening with my mom while in town for a quick weekend away. we showed up with no reservation and sat at the bar until we were able to be seated. we ordered a drink at the bar and enjoyed the area while waiting. there's a really nice bar. the drinks are a bit pricey though. we were seated and our waitress took our order quickly. i ordered the meal that had 3 types of fish and it was great. the fish was really fresh and cooked well. i would recommend!< /review>

Came for lunch on a whim with no reservations (I recommend doing otherwise!) we were able to grab a seat at the bar. Had delicious chowder, crab and more! We saw a few seals swimming around outside too! Service was excellent and price is really what you would expect for the high quality of food you’re getting and it’s also San Fran so yah know.< /review>

Got here around 6pm dinner time, no waiting, got seated right away, got served right away, and drinks brought very quickly, ordered bowl of chowder for appetizer, and for the main we ordered lazy man's cioppino  and pasta puttanesca, very delicious but both dish taste similar in a tomato-ey way, still delicious, the prawn is just outta this world, seafood taste really fresh, service is great, price is incredibly high, about 110$ for two, yet great service, great food, great view, have that fancy vibe, great experience overall<//Text>

You can really measure the quality of a restaurant by the caliber of their bar. The cocktails are about as good as it gets, especially the Maple Bacon Old Fashioned. The food and service was just as impressive.<//review>

This is one of the best meals I have had. The atmosphere is "old school" but it doesn't matter...the food is top notch. There is a fishing boat dock right outside the front door to procure some of the seafood.< /review>

New Year’s Eve we got a table in the afternoon.  The place is a grand slam from start to finish.  The staff is so accommodating and pleasant.  I understand most of the staff members have decades of service.  Our server was absolutely wonderful!  Scoma’s seafood is about as fresh as it gets and the cooking was perfect.
I had the cioppino in a tomato stock .  Loved it.  Loved everything about this place.  Can’t wait to get back.</Text>

Great seafood! Old school atmosphere and charm. This place is a San Francisco icon. Kinda pricey, and the martini pours could be a bit bigger, but other than that, this is a top notch place to go. Definitely make reservations as it gets packed!<//review>

When my husband phoned about reservations, he was assured that we could walk-in without a wait. Upon arrival, we were told that there would be a wait of 30-45 minutes. This was after a party of 6 walked up immediately before us without a reservation and was seated. We then went to the bar to wait on our table.  Mikey the bartender was kind and efficient and those at the bar were so nice that we eventually chose to eat there. We were practically done with our meal when we were notified that our table was ready. Mikey tried to cover for the mistake but obviously those assigning tables did not care to us.  Given our $200 bill, it was not worth it. Never again.</text><time>1569223577502</time>< response>

We always accept walk ins but the wait time can change minute by minute as people arrive constantly. It sounds like you enjoyed your time at the bar with Mikey and in most cases, when a party chooses to eat at the bar they are taken off the wait list for a table so we don't interrupt their meal to move them. Please accept our apologies if there was a mixup. Hopefully we'll have the chance to serve you again some day for what we're certain will be a perfect visit. Please let us know."}< /response>

Enjoyed the oysters Rockefeller as an appetizer, perfectly cooked. The grilled seafood platter was ok. Two of the 3 fish  were overcooked and the black cod had bones in it. The shrimp was perfectly cooked.<//Text>

The best crab louie salad and clam chowder in the City, period.  And that says a lot given the number and quality of the competition.  The waiters are always super social; so we always have a great time when we go.<//Review>

<text>This is one of the best restaurants in San Francisco.  Good food, excellent service and pleasant atmosphere.  Nancy is absolutely a pleasure - she always greets you with a smile and does everything possible to make your dining experience a great one. Stop by and ask Nancy to fix "Fran's Special"  you will love it!<//text>< pics>

The only downside was the service - which was bad- our server spoke maybe ten words to us in total - we had to ask for our starter plates to be cleared (after our mains had arrived) and for fresh cutlery. We still had a wonderful meal as nothing can detract from the food here - but clearing tables, a smile and couple of friendly words makes a difference between a good and a great experience.<//review>< Name>

Enjoyed delicious & fresh halibut yesterday, and returned today for delicious & fresh wild black cod, halibut, and a spicy margarita after a scrumptious, colorful, flavorful caprese salad.  A delectable, beautifully presented Torta Setteveli was our dessert to go.  All were generous portions.  They know fresh fish, they know how to cook it perfectly and were so kind and welcoming.  Their bread & butter are also amazing.  Thank you for a wonderful food experience - two days in a row!< /review>

I love Scoma's. So sad to see it empty due to the Coronavirus Pandemic. Please order takeout from them. Fisherman's wharf is empty so very easy to park and pick up.</Review>

Professional waiters with eye for detail. Cozy interior to stick around for couple of hours. They are very upfront on what is fresh and what comes out of the freezer depending on the daily deliveries. The Alaskan halibut was delicious.< /Text>

Loved finding this gem off the beaten path. The food was delicious. We are from New England and agree that the Clam Chowder was phenomenal! The service was excellent. Our server was Han Kim, I am not sure of spelling. She was so attentive and even funny. She made us feel comfortable and was very accommodating to our requests. Highly recommend and will be back if in the area.<//text>

The only downside to the restaurant is that it is a bit small, so I recommend reserving a table if you do not want to wait.<//Review>< Pictures>

We have been coming to Scoma's during family visits to San Francisco practically since the restaurant opened in 1965. The setting on the wharf is very special, and the jacketed waiters are exactly the way I remember them back in the 1960s.  They are also very helpful and efficient!  The food is good, but it's really the whole experience that makes Scoma's such a treat.</review>

Came here for dinner with my colleagues. They have a nice California craft beer list an extensive wine list (hot take: they also have a list available in Japanese). The service here was good. The food here was quite good. We all shared a seafood feast. The price point is about right for the area, that being said bring your wallet.<//review>

Scoma’s is a must place to visit when in San Francisco. The seafood is impeccable and its preparation respectful. Scoma's has the best crab Louie salad I have ever had anywhere. Their seafood is the freshest, purchased right off the boats steps away from the kitchen. Atmosphere was absolutely amazing. The scallops were perfection as was the calamari. Would definitely recommend this restaurant.</Text>

Classic Seafood Restaurant is the best way to describe Scoma's.  They have virtually any type of Seafood one could want and the service is fantastic.  It's got a lovely old timey feel and I loved the crab cakes.<//text>

<user_name>Donna Baldwin< /user_name><Rating>4< /Rating><text>I had a quick pre Birthday bite.  We just shared a salad and appetizers.  The crab cakes were delicious.  The calamari's corn meal breading was odd to me.  Not fine milled and I wasn't expecting the texture.  The bacon wrapped scallops were tasty but seemed warm. They would've been better with a little more heat...like a little sizzle or something.  The one thing I did enjoy but did not photograph was the Casa Margarita.  It would be one of the reasons I'd go back.  The atmosphere was nice and very old San Fran.  Although it is in the Wharf, it is a bit off the beaten track so you don't feel like you are hanging out with a bunch of tourists.  Many apologies if that offends, I just hate being with the masses.  I know...I should share such a wonderful city, but I'm selfish that way 😇.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Ordered four different dishes with the family, all came out great quality. Staff we met were very friendly and welcomed us as tourists. This place is so good, the popularity would probably require a reservation on busy days! Luckily, we did have a reservation, and we got seated right when we walked in.<//Text>

In my opinion this has to be one of the best restaurants in the US. Tucked away down a small street at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, Scoma's is like finding buried treasure. The restaurant itself is not overly ostentatious but the warm friendly staff make you feel imediately welcome.
I tried out Fettucine “Pomodori Secchi e Pollo”. Now I have eaten Pasta dishes in around 16 countries, including Milan, Italy. I have to say, this was the best chicken pasta dish I have ever tasted. It was sublime. Its no surprise, whereever you look that this particular restaurant has reviews of 4.5 stars and over. My rating is a full 5* and that it is my number 1 restaurant in the US so far. If you are ever in the area don't miss an opportunity to pay Scoma's a visit.</review>

Everything is delicious, and the service is incredibly top notch ❤️ This place is definitely the best of the best as far as local seafood restaurants. However, their food is, in my opinion, overpriced by a noticeable margin. 2 crab cakes as an appetizer was very delicious, but not $21 delicious.</Text>

It was our first time in SF & we had been craving clam chowder all day (at this point it had been a brisk evening) & Scomas absolutely delivered (figuratively speaking). Not only was their food delicious, but their customer service and employees were very cordial. Candace especially went above and beyond to say the least. Shoutout to Candace!!! To say she made our first experience with Scomas eventful is an understatement. When you mix flavor packed, good quality food with even better quality employees, you obtain long time customers. Definitely will be coming back here every time I visit SF.<//text>

<review>Wow, talk about fresh.  Our waiter (Chris) guided our group on a fantastical journey of fresh seafood.  The seafood trio sampler and bruschetta were simply amazing.  I ordered the mixed seafood grill (the daily fish were halibut, salmon, and black cod) and was probably some of the best fish I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Can be pricey, but you get a healthy, filling portion.  Highly recommend.<//review>< Pictures>

Decided to eat at the bar instead of waiting an hour for a table for 2. Good decision because the bartender C. C. was a jewel! She gave us the best recommendations! Clam Chowder was loaded with fresh clams and so good with no bacon. Calamari fritti was lightly coated with rice flour and tender. Caprisi salad with heirloom tomatoes and homemade mozzarella was fantastic. Cioppino was loaded with seafood and delicious. Wrapped it up with 7 layer Torta Setteveli cake; light, chocolatey and creamy. A new favorite instead of Tiramisu.</text>

Excellent food, superb service, and Negronis on tap.
What more can you ask for? A cheaper price tag!
With all due respect - they could take it down a notch.
No complaints about anything else.< /Review>

Everything is fantastic at Scoma's.   This is a must if you are in San Francisco, excellent Clam chowder, Caesar salad, and freshest sea food you can get.   We love it here, family favorite!</Text>

I had a body Mary which was a tad lacking in pizzazz.  It was not worth the $15 they charged for it.

Before going on our honeymoon, we were told by several people that all the places to eat at or around fisherman's wharf are essentially the same...while that isn't a bad thing, the sole exception is Scoma's. While all the seafood around the wharf is likely fresh, at Scoma's not only do you know it is but the service and preparation they put into each meal is unmatched. Our server dutifully told us exactly which dishes were locally caught and prepared fresh vs frozen. I started with the clam chowder and can honestly say it was one of the best I ever had. For entrees, my wife and I had the locally caught, fresh blackened cod.  Perfectly cooked and spiced, it was so good, I had to slow myself down to enjoy it more...as well as stop myself from just going caveman on it and eating it with my bare hands. Also, as a bonus, our awesome waiter (who had previously asked what brought us to San Fran after learning that we lived in NJ) brought us some incredible sorbet and ice cream to congratulate us on our marriage/honeymoon. This added an entire new level to our experience. When we are in San Fran again, we will definitely be returning!</text>

The atmosphere, service & food are excellent. John A. was our Server & has been w/ them for many years. The seafood is brought to their adjacent Fish House for cleaning & prep. Every dish is made from fresh ingredients. Whenever we visit SF Scoma's is on our list of restaurants to dine at.<//text>

I loved how this amazing little place filled with folks seeking fresh seafood!!!! Incredibly attentive staff and our group loved each of their chosen dinners. Right on the dock at FW, with a beautiful view of the Harbor looking toward the Golden Gate Bridge.
Recommend the Tito's Moscow Mule. Can't wait to return.<//Review>

On the back wall next to the harbor, you'll find a plethora of celebrity photos who have enjoyed this cuisine with you. I would highly recommend.<//Text>< date>

<Review>I haven't been to Scoma's in about 5 years (I live in Texas), but it was and is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. And I have eaten in many of the finest restaurants in the U.S. I was wondering if Joey Scoma still frequents the facility. He was a big part of the Scoma's experience.< /Review>< rate>

Every dish we ordered was beyond expectation and really became my default point of comparison when trying other restaurants. All the food was incredibly fresh and seasoned perfectly.

Service was absolutely fantastic and our server even gave us extra mini Tabasco bottles just by overhearing us talk about how adorable they were.

Our seating was unfortunately very small (right in the corner of the bar area) but truly a trivial matter when it comes to our great experience dining here.

Hope to visit again soon!</text><name>J K<//name>< resp>

<rating>3</rating><Review>Three is being generous. Traveling in San Francisco and Scoma's was highly recommended by our hotel staff and the glowing Google reviews. Our waiter, Timothy was less than interested in us as customers, not helpful in advising us on menu selections and overall, just a dud.  We should have asked to change to the waiter people nearby had- he was outgoing, knowledgeable and sold the menu items with skill and was not pushy. As for our entrees, my shrimp and scallops were OK, my client got the mixed grill which was over cooked and on a par with hotel banquet fare. Dessert was limited, and the tiramisu was suspiciously like what Olive Garden served. For nearly $200, this was disappointing. The salmon mac and cheese was actually great, so possibly I should have settled for this and a salad. We did enjoy the location and decor, and might (?) give Scoma's another try, with the hope this was just an "off" evening.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><time>1567562510718<//time>< Name>

Not easy to find, the clam chowder was fantastic! I live in socal so do not get up north often but glad I was able to visit this place. Crab cakes had great flavor.

Be sure to get the clam chowder, you will be happy you did.

Will be back for sure!<//text>

<Date>1556431014458</Date><Text>Let me start by saying coming from NY especially near many Italian and seafood inspired places I came in with very high expectations.  Although the food was good by many standards, it was not WOW.  Typical seafood fare, and flare.  Service was fast, courteous, and prices were what one would expect for the area and for seafood.  I had a plate of pasta and assorted seafood.  Seafood was fresh tasting and the pasta was good.  I also has a cup of the crab bisque which was very rich and filling- the highlight of the night.  My fiance had a grilled platter of assorted fish- which was light, flaky but nothing to rave about.  All in all, if you're in the mood for seafood I would recommend Scoma.  However, if you're in the mood for dishes incorporating seafood to set a new bar- I'd say try somewhere else.< /Text>< rating>

Food is a 5 star.  Was excellent and the service was excellent as well.  Again 5 stars.  So why a 3 star rating.  I was seated in a small room in the back of the restaurant.  Attached to this room with no separation was a waiter service area.  You know coffee makers, drink machines.   Wasn't too bad until they started bussing table in the larger dining room and walking though the small dining room.  Then making a lot of racket racking and stacking dirty dishes.   If I wanted a nice view of a food prep area with a lot of noise I would have gone to Denny's.  I didn't complain during the meal as it was my wife's birthday and I didn't want to upset her my complaining.

With that said, food is good just watch out where they seat you.< /text>

As someone who comes from Europe and struggles with huge American portions, this place was reasonable when we ordered an appetiser to share and a starter each (came to about regular European portions). Recommend crab cakes - you get two with a little side salad/generous garnish, and the clam chowder (go for a bowl rather than a cup for a European ‘main’ size) and crab bisque.

Delicious, fresh, excellent! Usually recommended to reserve, we got lucky and walked in without a reservation. But a place this good will be busy - so either reserve or be prepared for a wait - it is worth it tho.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>This place is a MUST! My absolute favorite place to eat in San Francisco! The clam chowder is the best I've ever had. You can watch the fishing boats pull up and unload their catch as you dine.

This is as genuine as it gets! The best Crab-cakes ever in the hole wide world( my wife agrees). The «Lazy Man’s Cioppino» it’s wort
an 11 hour flight by it self. The service was outstanding, and intelligent. Thank you Scoma,
for making  two old trawelers so happy!!<//Text>

<text>I am from Massachusetts. Our limo driver in Boston suggested this place! All the way from Massachusetts someone was talking about this place. Location a 10! The food is all organic and the fish's wild and fresh. I got the halibut, my dad got the pasta Bolognese, and my mother and son at the scallops and shrimp. All dishes were a 10. The bread was excellent, and the service was a 10. We had Elizabeth. She was fun, efficient, and knowledgeable. We loved it here.< /text>< gmap_id>

If you must visit Fisherman’s Warf, this is the spot to go! It is a gem amongst the tourist traps of the area. Grab a plate of oysters or the incredible clam chowder. It won’t disappoint.</Text>

First time there. The waiter was more than helpful describing the menu and place of origin of the food they serve. I had the shrimp and scallops, they were excellent. Next time I'm back on the wharf, without a doubt I'll be back at Scoma's.</text>

<text>Nice place to go every few years.  They have their own fishing boats so most of the  fish is fresh. Three of us went for a birthday and with an apetizer for three, a salad and a main course each, no drinks or desserts, it came to  $187.00 before tip.
The service was great and our waiter was very helpful and friendly, but it's not very affordable except for special occasions.</text><userid>113451916518552191938<//userid>< GmapID>

Shrimp was slightly over for main course but the scallops were perfect. Plating and vegetables with the main, straight from 1965 when they opened. Wait staff? All from 1965 too I think. Not attentive to diners around me, got hit in the shoulder without apology twice as they walked by, and no sense of urgency. Very fresh seafood is about all this place has going for them.<//text>< Pics>

{'time': 1592014141885, 'text': 'Vol, it seems like you are referring to the issue FV Pioneer has brought up. Please know Scoma\'s has long been one of, if not the biggest supporters of the local fishing fleet, including FV Pioneer. Below is a statement from the Port of San Francisco outlining the facts of the situation:\n\n"This is a COVID-19 public safety issue now that Scoma’s can offer outdoor dining on their leasehold. Moreover, FV Pioneer has no claim to operate retail fish sales on property that Scoma’s leases.\nScoma’s voluntarily agreed to allow a portion of their leasehold to be temporarily used since 2017 without costs to FV Pioneer for retail fish sales as a good neighbor supporting local fishers. Otherwise, the FV Pioneer would not have been able to operate a fish retail business without the cooperation of Scoma’s and the Port.\nScoma’s can no longer accommodate FV Pioneer retail fish sales on its property due to health and social distancing guidelines. The City has offered new opportunities for restaurants, whose doors have been shuttered for the past three months, to operate outdoor dining in efforts to stem the financial hardship that the virus has caused on the restaurant industry.\nScoma’s and FV Pioneer attempted to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. As no solution has presented itself, the Port must support Scoma’s claims to use the property they are leasing from the Port. Thus, the FV Pioneer can berth there but it may no longer make retail sales."\n\nThank you for your interest and please contact the Port of San Francisco if you have any questions regarding this situation.'}<//Resp>

<text>I ordered the Petrale sole. This is a must stop if you are in the city. The waiters are the best. Old school. Bay view seating. If the walls could talk.

<review>The crab thermidor is basically an overpriced mushroom casserole with virtually no crab and an overall earthy flavor due to being 90% mushrooms. Yet another shining example of how Bay area seafood is horribly outclassed by literally any and every hole in the wall on the Gulf coast. Scomas is probably fine if you've never had fish and only vaguely know what seafood is.<//review><Response>None<//Response><Name>John Rogers< /Name><date>1551404650033<//date><userid>103692882359454745718</userid><gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//gmap_id></record>

Ordered some hot and cold plate appetizers and then the dungeoness crab. It was really messy but amazing! So much of the menu is brought in right from the docks and processed in a building steps away from the restaurant. The ambiance was classy and the servers were very friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. If you're looking for a good seafood option, this is a great choice away from the tourist traps.< /text>

Don’t go! We went because of the reviews. The food is mediocre at best! The calamari was horrible, chewy.. worst I’ve had. The plates they served the food on had old food on the bottom of it. The waiter was annoyed when we asked for a clean plate. The main course, Fish, was decent.. but for 2 people with 1 drink and no desert the bill was $120.. I got higher quality food at the quick serve walk up at the wharf! They must pay people do the reviews. Don’t go!<//Review>

We would have been happy to replace any item you did not find perfect for you, although our calamari is one of our most popular dishes. Please know we only serve the most sustainable fish that is delivered daily to us right at our own pier. It is caught by our own boat or other local fishermen who adhere to the strict Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program for sustainability. It's unlikely you'll find more commitment to sustainable seafood anywhere. Please accept our apologies if you had a dish with food on the bottom of it. That is very unusual as we utilize the finest commercial dishwashers available in the industry. Hopefully we will see you back some day and we'll help you choose items you will love."}<//resp>

My family and I were there yesterday, we got seated right away but it took 10min for a waiter to come to our table, he came because my uncle called him to clarify something on the menu. I wonder how long we would have waited if my uncle wouldn't have called. The guy looked at us as if he had no interest of serving us. I guess we were not his class of customers. We were treated very poorly.<//review>

Old school restaurant hidden near pier 39.
See if you can find it.
Worth the search.
The cioppino is fantastic
The Crab louis was split between 3 people and we still struggled to finish due to the generous portion. Highly recommended a visit.
Right out of the 70's decor.
Really cool find.
Bloody Mary's were boring. Stick with the wine.<//Review>

I was recommended this place since I am visiting the area with family. All I can say is it’s definitely worth the wait and it’s very good food. Our waiter was very nice and came to find us when we were told a 30 minute wait. We got to sit next to the fireplace and look out at the water and see all the interesting fishing boats for the pier.
I had the fried combo platter which was delicious. The prawns and cod were cooked perfectly and were not heavy at all considering it’s a fried dish. Normally this dish comes with scallops but I cannot eat scallops and they very kindly swapped them out for more prawns.
This place is good for both locals and travelers. The cost is good for the fresh food you find here. Definitely recommended!< /Text>

Disappointing. Waited two hours for a table after being told it would be a one-hour wait, there was a couple already seated at the first table they walked us to, the next they were literally setting up in the walkway for us. Ordered an appetizer but dinner came out first so never got to try it. Food was great, only reason for any stars, but not much better than the other places we dined during our stay.</Text>

Discovered this place while visiting San Francisco. It is just off the main drag, so it is easy to miss, if you aren't looking for it, specifically. That is a good thing. The restaurant is quieter and much higher quality food than the places among the main road. The history behind this place is fascinating.

The seafood is fresh caught and delicious.

The staff was very friendly.

I did not have a reservation, but I arrived early enough that I only had about a 20 minute wait. Call ahead if you want to guarantee a timely seat.

I will definitely go back next time im in the city.< /text>

Good sea food
Old school restaurant. The kind of place you ask the waiter what is good today and order that. Crab bisque was lovely as was the crab. Be warned it is messy eating half a crab. Wine list is very nice< /text>

Probably the finest restaurant  in San Francisco.  The staff is very polite  and make you glad you came. The food is to die  for. The best seafood in the Bay Area. The chef's  do a great  job of preparing the food as you ordered lt. No ready made  meals here. Everything is cooked to order.  The restaurant  is very clean and neat. Top it all off they park your car for free. It's not cheap but we'll worth the price. I've been coming to Scoma's for over 50 years never been disappointed.< /text>

$$$ is little higher but affordable.
One of best restaurant in fisherman's wharf San Francisco.
If you want to visit this place I recommend early time is wonderful.
If not you have to wait at least half hour.< /review>

It is a peaceful place. We enjoyed watching the airshow from there. The location is perfect. It has an amazing beautiful view. I had fun being there under the sunny sky and admiring the airplanes.<//Review>

Fantastic old school charm and grace.  A staff that knows what it is doing, and a well trained chef combine for a extremely pleasant dinning experience.  The food is everything you should expect at this level.<//Text>

Amazing food, this place is hidden back behind all the other restaurants at the Warf, and that makes it feel a bit more special. What a great way to start our stay in SF!< /review>

<Review>Great seafood! I had the fried platter with the prawns, scallops band fresh cod! It was served with fries and a small side of slaw. I didn't care for the slaw, but everything else on the plate was delicious! Our waiter was friendly and provided us with excellent service. I
We had their 7 layer cake for dessert, it was delicious!<//Review>< Date>

<Review>I was conducting my San Francisco Photo Tours for my Florida clients and a Lyft Driver recommended Scoma's for the best clam chowder in San Francisco. The restaurant was hard to find but we finally found it. Service was real slow when we arrive like 9 pm. It was busy and we finally got our clam chowder. Lots of black/white celebrity photos on the wall. And also the Bar area was really nice and quiet and luxurious.  This place has history and prices are $$$ so be sure to have at least $ 100 in your wallet. It's worth a visit on your next trip to San Francisco<//Review>< resp>

We have been coming to Scomas for decades. We moved away from CA to N. Carolina, so we came to eat on a visit back. The food was fantastic and our service was impeccable as always. We asked for special orders from the old menu, which they made for us. I am glad they are now committed to sustainability, but the prices had gone up a lot and the portion sizes have gone down. The price increase, along with the smaller portions is the reason for 4 stars rather than 5. I can see one or the other, but not both. The price increase for the seafood saute was 30%!</review>

Outstanding food and service!!! We actually didn't know where to eat and some nice man on the street recommended Scoma's. It pays to be brave to ask a complete stranger for a dinner recommendation!! The food was crazy good and our server (Heather, I think) what quite honestly one of the best servers we ever had.< /text>

Food: Calamari was overcooked and very tough. House seafood soup was delicious. There was a lot of food in the Poor Man's Chopionno. I don't think it was worth it for the money paid though.

Atmosphere: Right on the docks. Feels like it

Went here for the chiopino.   Was not disappointed.   Service very good, timely, attentive, knowledgeable.

Anything from the sea is ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ here.

I was conducting my San Francisco Photo Tours for my Florida clients and a Lyft Driver recommended Scoma's for the best clam chowder in San Francisco. The restaurant was hard to find but we finally found it. Service was real slow when we arrive like 9 pm. It was busy and we finally got our clam chowder. Lots of black/white celebrity photos on the wall. And also the Bar area was really nice and quiet and luxurious.  This place has history and prices are $$$ so be sure to have at least $ 100 in your wallet. It's worth a visit on your next trip to San Francisco<//review>

I'm an SF local, so this isn't a place I would normally visit. However, after visiting with my family, I can say that this place is worth a trip. The location out on the pier gives it a truly classic SF feel. Looking back at the city and out toward the Bay is spectacular. The decor is dated, but charming. The food is very good (but not great). Come to this place for the classic experience and you won't be disappointed.<//text>

The shrimp I just had here was rubbery and tasteless, vegetables (green beans and carrots) were undercooked.  Our family has been going to this restaurant since the 60's.  It has officially been removed from our list of "places to eat in SF". Oh, the clam chowder was amazing.<//Review>

I'm genuinely confused by how highly rated this is. Even for the fisherman's wharf or Pier 39, the food was pretty terrible. The clam chowder was alright if you could overcome the grittiness of what I assumed was poorly cleaned clams. I will say that the truffle fries were good, but slightly oily. I got the petrale dore, which was recommended by our waiter, and it was absolutely horrible. I would not recommend this dish unless you like to pay $35 for oily, deep fried cardboard. The only redeeming thing on the plate was the tartar sauce, but that wasn't enough to cover the horrendous taste of the petrale. When I told the staff who took my staff that I didn't want leftovers a sit was just not good, nothing was done about it. Seriously, make the trek to Woodhouse, Waterbar, or anywhere on the grotto if you want good seafood.< /review>

I had the sole, it was great. House made tarter sauce. Wife had Pasta that included shrimp, mussels, and clams. Tomato based sauce, was spicy for her. Laid back, amazing service. Highly rexrecomm reservations, as we were leaving most were having a 45 to 60 minute wait for walk in.<//text>

<Review>Terrible bartender looked high. I ordered a salad, I was served 3 pieces of huge lettuce with 3 croutons. When I asked for balsomec vignette they gave me a cup of oil.Don't EVEN ask for steak sauce, they do not have any. The portions are smaller then ever. I love crab that is why I traveled 3 hours to eat THERE! Food is NOT WORTH $160.00</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Y U M !
I bring any and all seafood lovers here. It is one of my happy places in San Francisco. Clam Chowder is a must for a start. Calamari is cooked almost perfectly every time - it has been over cooked before (reason for me giving 4 stars) I recommend ordering a whole crab with the garlic butter sauce on the side so it doesn’t drink down to your elbows like it did me. The cod dish is delicious, cooked to perfection, flavors are out of this world.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSBBJYPv2fpUO35fVGxwbSCcFDA2JUl_s3eKrk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Scoma is heavenly.  Be patient and have a grand  time.  I had the A Scoma's original  Cioppino. all the crab, scallops, muscles clams is like poetry in motion on your taste buds.  The attentive waiter suggest the most wonderful red wine that set a great evening into motion.  Everyone is friendly no matter how busy they are.<//text>

The children’s meal was fantastic since it included not just fish and fries but also greens and carrots!  And, what’s more, it was served on an actual plate! (Unlike many children's meals.)

The meal was just awesome.  It was so fresh and delicious .  I really enjoyed the fresh pickles on the side.  Kevin, the waiter went the extra mile with his over the top personality, service and dedication to  great customer service.  The restaurant is very clean and the atmosphere is top of the line making a comfortable setting and a fine dining exsperince.< /Review>

This was the place that was recommended to us over and over. It didn't disappoint. The waiter explained what on the menu was wild caught. The calamari and crab were both very good. They make their own grenadine, which makes for a unique and very delicious Shirley Temple. Their Bloody Marys are also fantastic.< /text>

Got there in time for a fresh made caesar salad but the other salads weren't so fresh. Soups were good as always, my kids love the mac and cheese. Everything else was fine. Only noticable difference from other locations is the slowness in them clearing tables, they sat with dirty dishes  for some time before getting cleaned.<//Text>

I wish I could eat here more often.  I drive the two hours from my home, parking by valet, short walk to entrance, located next to Pier 39.  The best scallops ever!  What can I say - it's always what I order.  Bar seating, view of fishing boats, and an occasional seal swimming by.<//Text>

By the fishing docks in San Francisco. It is a good quality fish restaurant in the Fisherman's Wharf area. Get your fish next to area where the fishers unload their stock. Talk to the fishermen and fisherwomen, if you want. Then, have a meal.<//Text>

Mediocre. Not really anything special. The food was ok. Got the cauliflower tacos and they were good, but anything you would expect from a chain.</text>

This was the place that was recommended to us over and over. It didn't disappoint. The waiter explained what on the menu was wild caught. The calamari and crab were both very good. They make their own grenadine, which makes for a unique and very delicious Shirley Temple. Their Bloody Marys are also fantastic.< /review>

The clam chowder was alright if you could overcome the grittiness of what I assumed was poorly cleaned clams. I will say that the truffle fries were good, but slightly oily. I got the petrale dore, which was recommended by our waiter, and it was absolutely horrible. I would not recommend this dish unless you like to pay $35 for oily, deep fried cardboard. The only redeeming thing on the plate was the tartar sauce, but that wasn't enough to cover the horrendous taste of the petrale. When I told the staff who took my staff that I didn't want leftovers a sit was just not good, nothing was done about it. Seriously, make the trek to Woodhouse, Waterbar, or anywhere on the grotto if you want good seafood.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><gmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /gmapID></record>

One of my favorite places, does not disappoint.  Excellent old fashion to begin, chiopino is amazing.  Excellent wait staff, very attentive to your every need. Did not have a long wait, which is the norm.  A wonderful dining experience. Only downfall is they didn't have creme brulee.< /text>

<Review>A San Francisco icon. Still every bit as good as it was the last time I was there 35 years ago. We had the fried anchovie and calamari app, which was wonderful; the "Fritto Misto." The sauces that comes with it were special. The rest of the meal, and the service was perfection. Add the window seat, watching the seals playing in the water, and the charming, good-humored valet, and the experience became the cherry on top of our San Francisco sundae.</Review>< username>

I was the only one to have the Canadian lobster tails and the only one with excruciating stomach pains and severe diarrhea within thirty minutes of leaving the restaurant with a 2.5 hr ride home due to heavy traffic in the city. Never been sick after a meal in my life. I can tolerate just about anything. I put the blame on the lobster tails as we all had the same clam chowder and appetizer.  I was the only one eating the lobster main course. Thankfully the doctor encouraged me to use miralax to  get rid of the tainted food.

Top notch service beginning with hostess and host...so friendly and professional- sorry to the two of you but the service was so spot on that we didn't have time to get your names!  Tim, our waiter was on the spot at all times.  As soon as we thought about it, he was there with questions or suggestions.  Food was a 5 on scale of 5 but to us, it was all about the service from the live communications via text regarding our reservations to the warm welcome and prompt seating to Tim's superb attention without interruption and Jin Lin's water and setting service.  Final point, this was my second time visiting Scoma's...first was 20 years ago and the service and food have not wavered.   Maybe others in San Francisco that have higher ratings but for the atmosphere, service and taste, it's our favorite.</review>

<text>So, I grew up in the Bay Area and headed to Scoma's on a regular basis. I have been gone for 20 years and went back to visit family. Sad day for us. The quality of the food is nothing like 20 years ago. They get 2 stars for our server, Jean Paul.<//text>< Pictures>

We are sorry to hear you feel our food is not as you recalled, but we believe we have only improved over the years. All our seafood now meets or exceeds the very strict sustainability standards set by the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program. We also go out of our way to support the small, local fishing fleet right here in San Francisco, and they are delivering their catch to us almost daily right at our dock. We're pleased to know you enjoyed your server, and hopefully we'll have the chance to serve you again soon and help you choose items you will love. Please let us know if you can make it back in."}<//response>

<Review>Coming from a tourist's opinion I felt this place was overrated. It's good, but for the price point I expected more. There were much better seafood restaurants for the same price in SF.<//Review>< Response>
{'time': 1548351759087, 'text': "We appreciate your visit and feedback, Mike. Thank you. Please know everything we serve, from the all-organic produce direct from local farms, to the freshest, most sustainable seafood caught in accordance with the Monterrey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch standards, is certainly more costly than what most restaurants use. Plus, we pay our employees a livable wage which isn't always the case in the restaurant business. Even so, our prices are still in line with other top restaurants in the city. Hopefully we can have you bak some day and help you choose items you will love. Please let us know if you make it back in."}<//Response>

<text>We visited based on a suggestion from family, and i am so glad we did, since we might not have looked for it or visited since it doesn't stick out very well. The ambience inside is fun and cozy, we waited about 35 minutes to be sat but we hung out at the bar.  Great wine selection bar staff was very friendly. We had a pasta dish and fried shrimp and scallops. Everything was perfect. The pasta sauce was creamy and flavorful and the fried items were crispy but not soaked in oil. The service was fantastic. Loved this place.< /text>< Gmap_id>

This was our first trip to San Francisco. Our tour bus driver recommended Scoma. So we went. The location and atmosphere are great! We waited an hour to be seated.
The food is fair, small portions of fish which were over cooked. My husband said his fried seafood dish was not good. But in all fairness, we are from the northeast where the seafood is probably the best!
We've been to many $$ restaurants that were better than this $$$.<//Text>

<Text>An elegant, yet with a pleasantly low-key atmosphere. A star choice if you are looking for good quality fresh sea-food with a twist. Charmingly located by San Francisco quay. Beyond the main dishes displayed a good selection of wines and nice deserts. A bit pricey but totally worth it.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34</gmapID></record>

Superb seafood in waterfront location in San Francisco.  Excellent selection of well-cooked fish and seafood dishes, good wine selection, good atmosphere and friendly service.  Small amount of parking, but you'll probably want to get a cab here and taste their wine anyway!<//text>

Wonderful food and service. The fried calamari are a great appetizer and the seared halibut is a wonderful choice. Highly recommend a visit. Some people say it's pricey, but I can't agree with this statement when I compare the price of food at other restaurants in the area. At least here you get what you pay for, and there are many years of service and reputation to rely on. Just a pleasure overall. Will return whenever I'm in town.</review>

Terrific from the time we arrived to the time we left.  The food was first class. Everyone in our party of four had a different meal and everyone really enjoyed it. Our waiter was gracious and entertaining. Sweet desserts were delicious and reasonably priced. The same menu is used for both lunch and dinner. We were there for lunch, and as a lunch item the entrees seemed a bit pricey. Each of the sea food items in my cioppino refresh season perfectly and tasted wonderful with the perfectly made broth.< /review>

<text>My family and I usually ride BART to SF and walk around pier 39. Whenever, we do, we always eat at Scoma's. The food is so delicious here. I love that I can get my favorite seafood or shellfish and my husband can get his steak or chicken. Whatever you order at Scoma's will be fresh and very delicious. You will love the wait staff as I do. They are knowledgeable about all dishes, wine, drinks, and desserts.< /text>< Pictures>

I had high expectations on this place and they were largely met. We had the crab chowder to start which was pretty darn good. We followed up with the mixed fish grill. The fish was really good, very nicely grilled but the rice pasta could have used more flavour. The bbq sauce with the meal was a knockout. Service was unobtrusive and the meals came out quick.<//review>

<review>The staff was very nice and service was prompt and courteous however the quality of the food doesn't match the price. I had the wagyu fillet with crab and the steak was very tough and the veggies we're under cooked. Other people at our table had similar complaints.<//review></record>

I visited in June of 2014. It took me a bit to get past the dated decor...

It was a little hard for a first timer to San Francisco to find, but turned out to be a hidden gem.

The food was absolutely out of this world. Dishes were spot on. Some of the best and freshest seafood I have tasted anywhere. Pasta was cooked perfectly (not over done like most places will serve).  Sauces tasted fresh.

This was the first restaurant I visited on my first visit to San Francisco, and it set the bar high for my expectations of the quality of seafood for the area. Some restaurants came close but none matched.

I would highly recommend this restaurant!< /text>

<Text>I was taken to this restaurant for my anniversary.  Believe me when I say I tried to get out of it.  I didn't want to sit in a restaurant that smelled of fish or had creatures swimming awaiting their doom.  So I balked all the way to San Francisco.  When we arrived I thought it's a "Hole in the Wall" from the area we had driven into.  Then a valet came to park the car which I found odd because the restaurant appeared very small from the outside.
Boy, was I fooled.

Inside, you have a reservation counter and a cozy waiting place upstairs with vintage pictures on the wall.  There may be a 30 - 45 minute wait but you are not uncomfortable.  Drinks may be ordered from the waiting area and it's not drafty.  Upon going to the dining room, the doors were slid back and what a view!  Elegant dining room with a back wall view of the bay.  Service was on point and at the time Walter was my server.  He was the most charming man ever.  I had the Lobster Provolone Dinner and it was hands-down 5 star!  We had a Lovely evening.

Two weeks later in-laws from Germany arrived and after hearing about Scoma's took us out to this restaurant.  We all had a delightful time and this is now my favorite restaurant.  The crab salad is a must!  One salad fed 4 adults and we were almost too full for the meal.  Excellent!  10 Star!!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

This is my favorite place to dine in San Francisco. We always get the Cioppino, which only gets better each time we eat here. It is off the beaten path a little , built on it's own little Wharf shared with working fishing vessels so all the sights, sounds and smells are there. (A disclaimer...smells like the sea, not dead fish....inside it smells like wonderful cooking 😀). The wait staff is extrodinary. They have all been there for, I kid you not, for decades. I feel this place has not changed much since it opened....they know what is good and they keep doing great food.<//text>

<text>This little gem of a seafood restaurant is hidden at the end of the pier. Valet parking at the end for customers.  Driving over a small bridge and around a blind corner, lol.  Well worth the search!  We ordered the   crab bisque 🦀 and lobster thermador which was more than enough for two. We did not want to wait for a table so we ate at the bar.  The bar area is a bit crowded, but again, the food is worth it. I highly recommend this restaurant.<//text>< pics>

This is an old school seafood restaurant on the waterfront. The service here is always top notch and the free valet parking on site is of no small value in this area.</text>

<Text>We had drinks in the upper bar, where the ambience is perfect. The mixologists are super, interacting and explaining things to patrons. The cucumber in my G&T was a work of art, they obviously take their craft seriously. Jean-Marc served us with infectious enthusiasm.

I cannot think of a better way to while away a couple of hours before dinner.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Has a great view of the city and the habor with the Golden Gate bridge in the back ground. Be careful before deciding to eat here menu wise. The menu on the sidewalk is for ground level dinning. There was no menu present for upstairs with views you have to ask at the sidwalk level to see it.<//Review><Rate>3< /Rate>< user>

Very friendly and helpful staff, food was very good and portions huge (for a Brit)!  Maybe consider sharing.

Pricing wise you will find much cheaper restaurants just round the corner, but I can't imagine they are of the same calibre.</review>< Pics>

Excellent. As an occasional UK visitor Scoma's is the first place on the Wharf I would eat. Food was superb and the portions large. I was pleased two of us shared the calamari starter otherwise I would have have been full before the seafood saute arrived. This was outstanding, cooked to perfection. Quality wine was reasonably priced for a restaurant. Service was with a smile and provided just the right of information.< /review>

Scoma’s restaurant is a must do for any foodie traveling through San Fransisco. Located in Fisherman’s Wharf this homy restaurant is within a hub of sight seeing to do’s. The food is tasty and fresh and they have a full bar that offers craft cocktails. The ambiance is comfortable and somewhat upscale without being pretentious. Waitstaff is experienced and gracious. There is also a valet option as parking can be a challenge on the wharf. Come down and give this local favorite a try.< /Text>

I would give it six stars if I could.  Atmosphere was great, service was fantastic and the food was excellent.   I had the swordfish piccatta and would say it is firmly in my top 10 favorite meals ever.  John was our server and I don't remember having better service anywhere.  We will be back.<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Top notch!  We make plans to dine at Scomas every time we are in San Francisco. We are never disappointed in the meals and service. This time around my husband had the Chopino and he loved it. I had the Fish & Chips lunch special which was great portions of tender fish in crispy beer batter. Soo Good! Their clam chowder is very delicious also, we shared a cup just because we have to have chowder with sour dough when we come to the wharf & this one hits the mark. I suggest you walk past all those noisy eateries along the main street to this legendary restaurant, follow the signs to Scomas.< /text>< pics>

Has a great view of the city and the habor with the Golden Gate bridge in the back ground. Be careful before deciding to eat here menu wise. The menu on the sidewalk is for ground level dinning. There was no menu present for upstairs with views you have to ask at the sidwalk level to see it.</Review>

<Review>Great food in a bit of a hidden away location. Ate for lunch as a party of 8, no pre-booking.

Very friendly and helpful staff, food was very good and portions huge (for a Brit)!  Maybe consider sharing.

Pricing wise you will find much cheaper restaurants just round the corner, but I can't imagine they are of the same calibre.</Review>< Pics>

<text>I've never eaten at fisherman's wharf but on my last trip I couldn't avoid it. Scoma's was probably there before fisherman's wharf turned into the tourist trap it is today. The age is reflected in the interior, which makes for a rather charming/cozy atmosphere. The waiters were friendly and helpful. Food is rather pricey but OK.</text>< Gmap_id>

Good food, even if I find the portions oversized. The place is not so hectic as many of the fisherman Wharf places are. Yet you may have to wait for a table. It was just the two of us and we are at the bar which was perfect< /review>

Classic white tablecloth Californian seafood restaurant, with professional table service, fresh fish and a good enough bar. The plancha seared calamari were really good and I also had the crab Thermidor and shared crab plate and both were fine. People here are a mixture of tourists and adult old time Californians and the menu is the traditional old time french inspired seafood cuisine. It's a five stars if you are really into that, otherwise it's a little bit expensive for what they offer.</text>

<Text>Brought my wife, her mother and father, and my son and his wife down to spend two days in San Francisco before we headed down to Carmel. We are all big seafood eaters and picked out Scoma's because of it's high rating. We all had mussels except for one person in our group, and all but the one became violently ill that night. Easily the worst food sickness we have ever had. Please be avised, I would never order mussels or shellfish again from.this restaurant. Although we at this point would never go back to Scoma's.<//Text>< UserId.>

I've never eaten at fisherman's wharf but on my last trip I couldn't avoid it. Scoma's was probably there before fisherman's wharf turned into the tourist trap it is today. The age is reflected in the interior, which makes for a rather charming/cozy atmosphere. The waiters were friendly and helpful. Food is rather pricey but OK.< /Review>

Nothing was particularly wrong, but nothing was spectacular either. We tried Scoma's based on several recommendations by friends. Our waitress was great, very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We order drinks to start while deciding what to eat, the drinks were delivered quickly, they're fine...a little light on the alcohol based on how much they're charging and not made as well as other places. We order an appetizer to split and order our entrees at the same time. Our appetizer never comes... It ends up being delivered with our entrees. Not what we wanted with an appetizer but ok. I order the cioppino, and it was tasty. He orders the steak (doesn't like seafood), and it's just ok... The steak was cooked well enough but not great, the parmesan polenta was not very good (I've made better at home) and the mushrooms were just ok (he didn't like the texture of how they were cooked). We decide on dessert, our waitress expounds on how great their pastry chef is.... It's a lie, the desserts were no better than grocery store bought desserts. Overall a disappointment based on recommendations and reviews, and their own reporting.</Review>

I had the mixed grill and it was small with a lot of filler vegetables.  The fish itself was tasty but very small pieces. For the price of 190 for two of us I wouldn't recommend  it. Go somewhere else.< /text>< pics>

<Text>I've been going to Scomas since I was 6 years old. Now I'm 58 years old.  I always have had a great time and great food.  Not this day last Saturday.  We were seated in lousy seats, we wanted hot coffee and got warm coffee we asked for it to be microwaved and the waiter said no we then asked him to take the coffee away then he came back with hot coffee.  Our order was taken very poorly attitude waiter, we ordered ciopino and we had this dish over the past 20 years and it tasted like tomatoe soup. The waiter asked how the meal was and we asked if the cook was new and we were told he'd been there a couple years. The waiter asked why are we asking and we explained the ciopino was just tomato soup with sea food.  Waiter said he would let the chef know. We are ok with that. Our meal was 160.00 we left a 40.00 tip. The waiter came outside and siad  thank you and we were happy about that. During our meal we heard a loud french accent waiter yelling at a dark beared waiter making comments to him that he would kill him, and tear him apart basic threats and that was disappointing.  So i am sad to say Scomas has lost its pasaz and quality and ambiance after my 50 years of going there. I felt i was treated lack luster because of my attire but rest assured we are well off. Oh one last thing as we were leaving a guy with a jaguars had lost his keys from the valet so sad we like the valet. So something is wrong at Scomas!</Text><user>111694606255710430707<//user>< Response>

We are sorry to hear you did not enjoy where you were seated. Please accept our apologies and know if that ever occurs again we are always happy to move you to where you'd prefer.

That should never interrupt a diner's experience and we will certainly address it so it never happens again. If possible please come in and introduce yourself some day so we can apologize in person, make sure we can put a face with the name and have you make sure the cioppino is as good as you always recalled.

Menu in the $20-$40 meal range. The clam chowder soup and clam chowder bisque are both delicious at about $12. The bisque is extremely crabby and smooth while the chowder is a bit more mellow and chunky.<//text>

Don't expect that, as everything will come with some sort of sauce that will hide seafood natural taste. If you're used to eat seafood with sauce, go for it. Locals seemed to like it a lot.<//Review></record>

Great dinner spot.   Off the beaten path but worth going out of your way.  Parking is tight so walk or uber.  Staff was excellent and very attentive.  Drinks and food were both excellent.  Old school "rat pack" feel, lounge areas and dinner seating allow for a couples or friends night out.  Portions were good size and reasonably priced.  Highly recommend the mixed seafood grill and butternut squash soup.< /text>

Perfect place for seafood right off the boat. Atmosphere is great and makes you feel like Frank Sinatra could be eating in the next room. Service is incredible, with the waiter attending to every possible need. One of the best draft beer selections I've seen yet!< /Review>

Truly a five star establishment! This place is old school - fantastic service, extremely fresh, and very much classic San Francisco. I would highly recommend the Pisco Punch if you like warm spices, the calamari is incredible, awesome crab cakes, and all of the entrees our party had were great. We had a layer cake dessert too that was excellent! Allow for plenty of time to enjoy a well-paced multi course meal here.<//review>

We have a tradition of eating lunch at Scoma's when we fly in to San Fran from the east coast.  It's our first stop.  It's always been great but this past Friday night (dinner for the first time), it was a major disappointment.  Not one of the five of us enjoyed our meal.  Dry, tasteless fish and blah-broth, lazy man's cioppino. Small portions of bland, dry fish for $40.00!  I don't think so.

The staff is great and the atmosphere is cozy and fun.  Major help needed in the kitchen.  There are too many places to eat in San Fran that are excellent and unfortunately, there is little excitement or interest in eating at Scoma's again.< /Review>

I recall this restaurant being so much nicer.  We arrived early for dinner and had a horrible table just off the bar area.  Service was very slow.  Food was good but nothing great.</Review>

This place is incredible .
I don't really like seafood but I loved every single thing I ate (& I even ate a tentacle!). My other half loved seafood and loved it too.The food is fantastic and there is a lovely atmosphere.
There's a classy 60s feel inside (the waiters are in white jackets and  and just so lovely and knowledgeable). Scoma have their own boat and you can literally watch the fish come off the boat, into their processing plant and into the restaurant. You can't get fresher.
Don't let the lack of outdoor seating put you off. We arrived at sunset on a lovely night & wanted to sit outside ...... But actually a seat in the lounge by the window was incredible. We watched a lovely sunset and kept warm.< /Review>

My sister and I has a late dinner here tonight. We added ourselves to the handy yelp waitlist at 8:00pm and were 17th in line.  We were instructed to be at the restaurant at 8:30pm.

We arrived late because or lyft driver was very slow but they still honored our waitlist spot.  We had a very professional and attentive waiter but not extremely personable.  I ordered the 3 fish grill (cod, salmon and halibut) and a cup of clam chowder. I loved the halibut and the salmon was above average the cold tasted a teeny bit underdone but that may have been the texture since it is a flaky fish.  She ordered calamari app, ceasar salad and a cup of clam chowder. She enjoyed everything as well but we both agreed the clam chowder was the belle of the ball.

It was a pricey meal at nearly a hundred dollars for our meals but it was a prime location and beautiful post sunset view.

While I wouldn't insist on a revisit, I have no regrets.  It was a lovely meal and a great experience.< /Review>

Amazing dinner!  Service was excellent. Our server, Sal, made us feel so special. My daughter wanted a pasta dish with crab, but the menu did not offer one. Sal said they could make it for her. He recommended the white wine, mushroom and garlic sauce and the dish was perfect!  The cracked chilled crab was juicy and sweet!
I will recommend SCOMA'S to all my friends that plan to visit SAN FRANCISCO!<//Review>

Amazing food, hidden gem. Excellent waitstaff recommendations, patient with many questions and very attentive to food allergies.

Highly recommend!

Based on location and lack of signs pointing you there, very much seemed like a “locals secret”!<//review>

<text>We love Scoma's. It's great old school service and awesome food. There were at least 20 people milling around inside and out hoping to get a table, and it looked sketchy for our reservation, but we were seated at our table immediately.

Dinner for 4 - all 4 dinner were awesome!
Waited 15 minutes on a Saturday evening. My wife's crab was a huge portion and I had sole. The crab cakes were awesome! The server was very knowledgeable and patient with us.< /review>

The most amazing place ever. Always go here when in town. Best Cioppino in the world. Ask them to add cream and it makes it a thousand times better.</Review>

A hidden gem! For a primarily seafood place, the pasta here was one of the best I've had(and I eat a lot Italian food). The service was exceptionally great . Our waiter (so sad I forgot his name) kept us entertained as well as satisfied our every need. Thank you Scoma's for your hospitality and great food.</Review>

We had a pleasant evening and the place has old school charm but the food wasn’t amazing which was slightly disappointing given the price. If you are spending over $200 for your meal you really want to walk out saying “that was fabulous”....we didn’t< /Text>

My open faced albacore was delish even though it could have been a bit hotter. The green salad that came with it was tasty and I liked the kind off greens they used not your average ice Berg. It came with French fries with the skin. We were there for lunch so they offered lunch specials which I really at appreciated. They weren't skimpy in their servings either. Although the I've tea was a bit expensive $3 and it came in a small glass. It's the cheapest easiest drink to make. I was a bit irritated but then I remembered we had about 4 baskets of their yummy sourdough bread so I calmed down 😁  overall it was a nice dining experience for me. The service was great.< /Text>

Recommended by a cab driver, said they had the best clam chowder in San Francisco.... clam chowder is alright. Food is over priced. Our waiter was a chubby guy sounded just like Louie Anderson. Was very nice and friendly to everyone else, but when it came to be and my husband he never made conversation. Never going there again.</Text>

<Review>The website claims the restaurant is „vegetarian friendly“. Since we couldn’t find anything vegetarian on their menu, we called to ask. They told us they can make a salad and pasta. When we asked if that was it (considering they claim to be so friendly towards vegetarians), they hung up on us. Great customer service!</Review>< time>

<Text>I think Scoma's has gone down some.  The portions are not as large and the go-withs don't match the main dish.  I  had the mixed grill with a strange barley and carrot salad ... I dunno.   It didn't chime with me.   The setting can't be beat, though, and the Bloody Mary's are top notch.</Text>< pics>

Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.
After being repeatedly and shamelessly lied to about the availability of our table, it was impossible to enjoy anything these lying pieces of crud could serve. "Immediately" and "we're preparing your table right now"  mean at least a 30 minute wait at this nightmare of mismanagement and lies in my experience tonight.
Don't wait for a table here, don't eat here. These diots don't deserve a penny on your money.</Review>

Incredible food! Incredible staff! Chris B is quite possibly the best at what he does. And Scomas's kitchen IS the best at what they do - impeccable Italian style seafood. Take the time, spend the dough, eat like royalty.<//Text>

<Text>After a long day of touristy stuff with two kids we happened in on this local's recommended restaurant.  We were tired and it was about a 45 min wait, but we sat at the bar and the nicest bartender made us feel right at home.  Seafood and kids meals were excellent.  Garlic crab and seafood salad were top notch and my daughter especially liked the prawns.  I would highly recommend this for anyone in or around the area.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We love Scoma's. It's great old school service and awesome food. There were at least 20 people milling around inside and out hoping to get a table, and it looked sketchy for our reservation, but we were seated at our table immediately. Yes, they knew how to both take and keep a reservation. We'll be back.< /text>

<review>It's been years since we have gone to Scoma's. They had the best Ciopino I had ever had, so really looking forward to the meal. I didn't mind the 90 minute wait, because of the tremendous food. The sauce used to be garlicky and flavorful. This one tasted like fish and shellfish boiled in tomato soup, so pretty bland. Our whole group thought the food pretty average.< /review>< resp>

Now this is a place worth visiting again. Vintage sanfran pier extremely fresh seafood. Tasty, well presented and reasonable quantity. Had calimari, fried scallops with bacon and crabcakes. Main meal was halibut and it just melted in your mouth. Wonderful flavors.Service was stellar. Even after we asked for our 4th helping of sourdough bread.</review>

There were 2 sides to our experience.  First we went at 2:30pm and it was very busy, unfortunately they couldn't handle it.  We had a very efficient guy filling up our drinks and bringing us bread but that wasn't the waiter, the waiter took a long, long time to take our orders, even though we had told the drink-server guy we were ready ages before.  He also made an excuse rather than just apologizing.  Then my wife was brought her chowder way before my scampi starter, this is just amateur.  Then our mains were brought before our starters had been taken away, not such a bad thing but it's a clear indication of a badly run floor and pass.  The food was tasty but also expensive.  The table next to us had complained that one of their dishes tasted very strange although the chef did come over and apologize.  Overall it was great food with very badly organized service.  Don't go when it's busy and you'll probably have a good time.< /text>

A beautiful menu full of beautiful fresh fish, all sadly massacred by the over cooking of said fish. The dishes are also unfortunately accompanied by strange concoctions which insult the poor fish further then to add further insult to injury, it's extremely expensive.  The oysters are delightful and fresh, give these a try<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Hidden behind Fisherman's Wharf with a view of the water this place is worth the few extra steps and sometimes short wait.  Once you are seated you are greeted by the most friendly staff and walked through the delicious daily specials(many of them right off the boat).  They have a nice wine menu and you are given a nice basket of bread to munch on while your food is being prepared.

A little bit pricey, but well worth it compared to the other tourists traps around the Wharf this place is worth the money.  The Cioppino is to die for and comes in a huge portion, The fresh swordfish is also a favorite menu item.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<user>106041334903107118605</user><Review>The best possible seafood in San Francisco. Scomas is a landmark in Fisherman's wharf. They have the freshest seafood, right off the boat. Beautiful views day or night. The bay is lapping right up to the parking lot - and yes, they have free parking, just remember to tip the hard working valets. They can have long waits to be seated, you're welcome to call ahead and ask what the wait time is. The long waits to be seated are because they are the best seafood restaurant ever. People come from all over the world to eat at Scoma's.
Try it.  You won't be disappointed.< /Review>< Rating>

< Review>
This place came recommended by a wonderful tour boat captain. Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. Although the clam chowder wasn't terrible, it isn't worth the hype and was very starchy. Maybe living in Rhode Island I've become a snob. I was really disappointed in the Dungeness crab cakes. Shredded meat and lots of filler, when I had been expecting some decent limp crab cake. Service was terrible. Very slow. 10 minutes before being offered even water. I opted not to stay for a main course.<//Review>

<Text>Located near the end of Fisherman’s Wharf, this restaurant is upscale and serves great food. I didn’t realize how expensive most dishes would be, but the lunch specials were better and very tasty. I had a steak sandwich that was well prepared and filling. The fixed price lunch menus also looked like a good way to taste multiple dishes!</Text>< time>

<Review>Lovely place to eat! My wife and I were in San Francisco above the Fisherman's Wharf area from July 1 - 5, 2002, shortly after our marriage, and a nearby shopkeeper (would that I could remember his name or of his store!) recommended Scoma's as a great place to eat. He was right. Fantastic food and service. My one disappointment was trying Dungeness Crab but aside from that, nothing whatsoever to complain about. I can't wait to come back and enjoy the fine food and drink Scoma's has to offer. P.S. You do have Alaskan King Crab legs don't you?  ;)< /Review>< Rating>

Our Calamari is one of our most popular dishes exactly for the reason you listed--it is lightly fried, mostly tentacles and not the simple rings most places serve. But we understand that might not be for everyone. Hopefully we'll see you back some day and you will try some other items you do love. Please let us know!"}< /resp>< review>
Disappointed from the high ratings it received. Ordered the trio sampler first.  The calamari was mostly tenttactes and not fried adequately.  The scallops and crab cakes on it were decent.

My seafood in marinera sauce was decent but the bartender recommend a crab cream cheese casserole dish which was subpar.

Overall the food here is decent but definitely not superb like the ratings would lead you to believe.  The Fog House was much better with nice ambiance and actually cheaper!<//review>

The food and service are not as great as their location across the bay (Sausalito), but I enjoyed all of the dishes I ordered nonetheless.

If you're expecting the same experience as the Sausalito location, you will be a bit disappointed.  However, if you're craving any of their signature dishes and don't feel like crossing the bay, then it's conveniently located adjacent to Fisherman's Wharf.< /review>

<review>Seem like you get transfered back in time as the waiters have very traditional uniforms and it seems nothing got changed on the interior since 60 years. Better reserve a table as otherwise you need to wait. The food is delicious but pricy which is probably related to the proximity to Fisherman's Wharf. Definitely worth a visit as also there is a wide variety of dishes and not everything is seafood. A cool place...</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Oh my God this place is amazing! Seriously the best seafood you can get on the wharf! Do yourself a favor leave Pier 39 walk down to the Fisherman's Wharf and find this place and you will not be upset! Like seriously this place is crazy out-of-control bomb! I ended up going here twice on my recent weekend trip the SF. And I might head there this weekend also. The poor man's Cioppino is the best thing I've ever eaten in my life, and I crave it every day that I don't get some.</Review>

<review>Long wait,  slow service,  expect 2.5 hours total.  Food is good but not amazing.  Lobster and steak are flavorless.  So are the veggies.  Its by the water so pretty nice view,  but not all its hyped to be.  Wouldn't come again.<//review><userid>110589858203416721248<//userid><name>Marivel Espinoza< /name><Rating>3< /Rating><date>1346126003932< /date><gmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34</gmapID>< pictures>

I can't put my finger on it because the food was delicious ..and yes it was pricy...service was good as well.. possibly it was eating dinner watching the multitude of homeless dig though the dock trash for food right outside the window.

Stupid waiter ignored us, when we trying to order.
If you don’t want to servers us just ask someone else to do so.
I can definitely seen the difference between you sever other table and us,seen you sick smile. The $6 dollars only for cleaning fee, not for your service.
Anyway the food was just okey, don’t worthy. Don’t wasted your time and money. Nothing special!</Text>

A great mix of old school classic seafood and Italian restaurant with a modern sensibility of farm-to-table ethos. I love that they have valet parking in Fisherman's Wharf nightmare. And you can't beat the views.< /Review>

<review>This is a must if you visit San Francisco.  Their clam chowder is exceptional.  Very large clams, and very flavorful.

Expect 5 star service and 5 star prices.<//review>< Pictures>

This was a fantastic place to get some really good seafood. I had half a Dungeoness Crab chilled and the "Lazy Man's" Cioppino all topped off with a very nice glass of wine. Was a bit on the expensive side, but if you have the cash to spend you will have a great meal with a great view in a very nice restaurant.< /review>

<text>Overpriced, terrible service and awful food.  For these prices we should have had a leisurely dinner but that was not the case.  We had cocktails, appetizers & meal & we're done in less than 40 minutes.  We ordered the clams & they were just plan weird (definitely not the right texture).  The beet salad was good but the presentation was really unappetizing.  The fish entrees we had were "ok" but at $34 for 6oz. of salmon, it should have been a lot better.  Basically I will never recommend this place - NEVER!</text>< pictures>

I went here twice in one week - if you're in the wharf area,  this is a must try.  I like to sit at the bar,  and both times the service was excellent.  Wish I had gotten the Dungeness crab - it looked phenomenal.< /review>

We went because of all the good reviews, the views, and the history the restaurant had. But it was outrageously overpriced, the service was awful, and the food was okay but nothing spectacular and not even worth half of what we paid. The most disappointing place we ate in all of San Francisco.< /Text>

Touristy, classic seafood on Fisherman's Wharf, it's been there for decades literally.  Very traditional style decor and food, the best thing to get is the crab when in season only. They own their own boat, so the fish is as fresh as it gets.< /text>

<date>1554346266510<//date><Rating>5</Rating><Text>Oh my! What a find!   We were near Fisherman's Warf looking for a good bite to eat and Yelp suggested this place.   When we walked in I was a little worried that we were underdressed because the wait staff was bow ties and sharp as could be.  But I figured, "meh, my money's green."
Our waiter was very kind and kept our kids supplied with a delicious crusty bread. We barely scratched the menu but the fish and chips and clam chowder were absolutely excellent.  I for one am pretty hard to please with those two items and Scoma's nailed them.
Overall our lunch in SanFran was one of the best experiences of the trip.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

This is definitely one of those places that you have to go to in San Francisco. I have been told to go here by so many people and after sitting down and trying it I completely understand why so many people are in love with this place. As a tourist is one of those places you just have to try at least once.<//text>

The clam chowder was excellent, as was the black cod.  The servers were all very helpful as well. The 40 minute wait was worth it.<//review>

<review>First time that I have been to this restaurant. If you enjoy and appreciate New York style type of waiters, then this is the place for you. The meal that I ordered was a house speciality and it excited the pallet. I have learned to eat slowly and enjoy the flavors and presentation. The individual that was in charged of filling the water glass was excellent and attentive. I tried the chowder house speciality found that it was a smaller portion, as compared to Fog Harbor. I would definitely return to try other items.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

If you are eating here and have room get the Clam Chowder, Cioppino, or the Grilled Salmon with Lobster Ravioli. Every time I have eaten here it was great and I am going to be making another reservation to come here in the next week or two.</text>< rate>

<Text>From first glance of the neighborhood, I wasn't sure about this place. My gut said this is going to be cheesy, but I had seen really good reviews online.

It blew me away. Really good classic dishes, with authentic flavor. The crab cakes had just enough crab and the sauce was not tooo rich. Get the fried artichoke hearts, they were light but still crispy!

This is great for a date, anyone who wants to get a waterfront view, and a cozy place.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>Service was fine, but not equipped to solve the food questions.

I had the Classic Crab Louie Salad (~$40). The crab was tasteless. I ate about 1/3 and gave up. Server assured me it was not frozen, but the lack of taste suggested to me it probably canned. Server suggested they may have 'washed' the crab reducing the flavor?

My friend had the Poor Man's Cioppino (~$40), which was an apt description. Lots of seafood in a thick sauce that could have been V8 juice. The brussel sprouts($9) were very good, you can't really go wrong when you add bacon to anything. Tasty bread and butter. Definitely a tourist trap, would not recommend.

Total bill a bottle of sparkling water ~$107, no alcohol. Yes, we could have sent it all back and walked out, some days you just don't have the energy for that.

Tonight we have reservations at 'Dirty Habit' and much higher expectations.<//Text><Resp>None</Resp>< Pics>

I live in the Bay Area but only recently visited Scoma's for the first time.  Unfortunately, it didn't exactly meet my expectations.  The food was ok but was pretty bland, and the menu seemed severely lacking in creativity.  The fact that they give you free parking is great, but I found the prices pretty high for the quality of the meal.  Perhaps worth trying once, but I'm not sure I'll go back.< /text>

I had the seafood grill, and it was perfectly prepared. The service is great as well as the view. It's also a little hidden so tourists are likely to miss it.<//text>

Service is, of course, excellent for this type of restaurant.  The seafood although cooked very well, is over-priced and underwhelming. I found myself thinking about the seafood stands I saw on the wharf and craving bigger bites.<//Text>

One of just a few places along the wharf we enjoy. Their mussels are our favs though they were not so good last time we visited. The wait for a table is usually very long so call ahead.</review>

<resp>None<//resp><text>Love this place! Very fresh seafood, very tasty. Love the mafioso appeal. The walls filled with countless autographed celebrity photos offer amusing eye appetizers while awaiting our entrees. Best clam chowder I've ever had in The City. It's a little hidden but in a good way, likely keeping out wandering tourists or weekend hippies from chancing upon it, making it next to impossible to get a window table on a walk-in. Of all of the many eateries around San Francisco's great Wharf, Scoma's is the the only one I personally consider worthy of historical significance. Yes, Boudins began here and may still be the more popular restaurant even today, however in my opinion Boudins has grown into the Budweiser of bread. Scoma's has something no other Embarcadero restaurant has, a pulse, an identity, character, and bay city charm.  Stepping into Scoma's feels like stepping out of the city. A peaceful, quiet, sense will greet you as you enter as if time itself slows. Forwarding through time, neighboring eateries will likely fade away while Scoma's remains, gaining fame, iconic status, and historical importance. What Randy's Donuts is to LA, or what Katz Delicatessen is to Manhattan, so should Scoma's be to SF. From the cresting waves of the mighty Pacific Ocean, along California's golden coastline, a small port town filling with migrant ruffians and Forty-Niners quickly grew outward and upward. It grew across steep terrain, eventually gaining root spanning the entire Southern Peninsula. Where Giant Pacific Redwood forests once grew, now grows a mighty metropolis. A civilization so grand that Westerners know simply as, "The City," and it was here, hidden down a narrow alleyway, treaded upon by those who've come to know of it. There, built directly onto the wooden planks of a dock, nearest the point where city becomes sea, that is where you'll find it...  Scoma's. To all you soon to be first timers, you're welcome.</text><Name>Nichoulas Musselman</Name>< Pics>

It's a seafood restaurant so don't go there for the pasta. The alfredo wasn't very interesting and I don't eat seafood so there wasn't much else to try. The chocolate brownie with ice cream was delicious though. It's a big place with a lot of seats but they still had a waiting list on the weekend.< /text>

Food was excellent, and it had a nice ambiance. Most of the staff was wonderful, however our waitress was terrible. Unfriendly, would not get us drink refills, etc. Also, location is down a one lane alley, so can be tricky to get in and out. Worth the adventure though!<//Review>

<Text>At first the price scares most people, but that shouldn't stop anyone. After eating at many different seafood restaurants up and down the coast, Scoma's remains my favorite . I have never had poor service and the food is always excellent. It remains one of the few place that will make sure your visit is perfect and that is why I try to eat there whenever I visit San Francisco.</Text>< Pictures>

The seafood at Scoma's was very fresh and prepared deliciously. Our server was very passionate about his job and knew the menu very well. We are visitors to San Fran and we got a very good experience enjoying the local seafood at Fisherman's Wharf.<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Started with a perfect Bloody Mary while waiting 45 minutes for a table.  Never has a wait been so worth it!

We had a bowl of clam chowder.  Fresh clams and organic ingredients. It was far and away the best I have had!

The entre was Pasta Diplomatica which is sort of an Alfredo white sauce.  Fresh ground pepper and fresh grated cheese added to the mix. It was a huge portion of one of the best entre's I have ever had!  Simply delicious!

The wait staff, of which there are plenty, are always there before you need them.  Always filling glasses or taking care of things, but never intruding into the meal.

It was the best meal I have had in a very long time!  Only shame was we had no room for desert.  And the desert menu was sooo tempting.

I will never come to San Francisco and miss Scoma's restaurant!</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1550602402346, 'text': "Hi Frank.

I have loved this place since my father took me there as a child and young adult. I was killing time and thinking of calamari as I saw the Scoma sign. It was so tender and the spinach salad was awesome. I had enough left over to share with a friend.< /Text>

<text>We came to Scomas for lunch because of the great reviews and the free valet parking. Walked in right when they opened at 1130am and got a seat right by the window as requested. Excellent service by older gentlemen that took care of us, had the Cod on the lunch prefix menu along with four shellfish combo which was delicious , I will be back.< /text><Name>Angie Bernardo</Name><GmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /GmapID>< time>

<Review>The food was great and the waiter was amazing. He helped me choose softer foods (a week past wisdom tooth removal) and gave us a huge "sample" of a salted caramel gelato when we couldn't decide between a few desserts. I wouldn't way service is slow as others complained, I think the atmosphere is meant to be that way.<//Review><response>None< /response>< username>

Nice service! The oysters and fried calamari are very good. But the cod is a bit overcooked, and the linguini (with prawns) doesn't have too much flavor. With that price, I would go Cliff house instead..< /text>

I've eaten at this one and the one in Sausalito. I like the one in Saulsalito a little better, because you have a great view of the bay and the city while eating. The food is delicious! It's a great place to take friends from out of town, so they can try San Francisco seafood.< /text>

Every thing about Scoma's is dated and out of style but screams a desperate attempt at the appearance of class. Wood paneling, conference room seating and walls of photographs of celebrities no one under 40 can name.
The food was fresh and edible, but the dishes are the very definition of boring and poorly executed by what I assume are novice chefs.
The waitstaff are, from my experience, old, slow, dressed in the typical steak house white jacket/black pants and walk with a sad, hunched, shuffling gait.
Scoma's antiquity would be endearing, if the food were not so painfully boring.</Review>< pics>

The best place for fish in San francisco, period!  Try the Pacific Sole. Guaranteed to please. Some of the best crabcakes I've ever eaten. Excellent wine selection. Friendly staff.  Reservations suggested. I never miss a chance to eat at Scomas when I visit SF!< /review>

My husband & I just by chance found out about this "fabulous" place to eat. O'my is it ever wonderful, the food is spot on and the service is great. Seating can be a little tight, but since we had no reservations we couldn't complain. We had the "clams & pasta" clams braised in butter, olive oil, garlic & white wine, the roasted beet salad, and Denver Sole lightly sauteed. White wine and some yummy hot bread. Each course was served separately...we rolled out because the portions were ample enough to share. AND WE WILL RETURN!!!</Text>

<Text>Their food is by far the best seafood I've ever had, but what set them apart was the excellent customer services they had for both my kids which were sleeping in our huge double stroller! Luis was amazing with handling the situation and finding out a solution the manager as well did everything they could and closed a room for just my family to acomódate the stroller, thank you!</Text>< Resp>

<Date>1537374892445<//Date><rating>1</rating><review>We went there on 19 th sept seated and
All very frIedly but there seemed to be friction
When we inquired about the size of the meals
As the ladies were not big eaters it all went downhill from here the waiter became pushy
And condescending sensing we were tourists
Australian when we asked another  question
He grunted “tourist” gave us the bill and walked
Off. Then expect a tip
I feel some education in customer service
Would  be money well spent but rest assured  it
Won’t be ours
The food was good the service  and attitude of the staff was sadly lacking
We won’t be recommending this place purely
Because of the way we were treated .
Walk a couple of 100 meters past the entrance plenty of places 10 times cheaper and better food and friendly Cheerful welcoming staff

The hostess seated us near the service area at the end of the restaurant even though there were so many tables available at the elevated level of the restaurant. Only caucasians were led to the large elevated room while asians were put together in another smaller closed off area. Disappointed to see such blatant racism even today in a city which is so cosmopolitan.<//text>

I live in the Bay Area but only recently visited Scoma's for the first time.  Unfortunately, it didn't exactly meet my expectations.  The food was ok but was pretty bland, and the menu seemed severely lacking in creativity.  The fact that they give you free parking is great, but I found the prices pretty high for the quality of the meal.  Perhaps worth trying once, but I'm not sure I'll go back.< /Review>

The price is overestimate. We ordered a plate with 4 types of fish and a dessert, but nothing of it is delicious. Seafood smells terrible. A server David P. didn’t even ask us how the food was. Totally don’t recommend this place.< /Text>

Scoma atmosphere is dated, with 1990's seafood resteraunt feel.  The resteraunt is clean and we'll maintained.  Food offerings are good and prepared well. I had the salmon.  Expect a wait unless you sit at the bar which is typically full also.  Customer service was neutral, maybe because of workload, but I didn't find the service pleasant.<//review>

< Review>
The area we were sitted in was perfect for our party. The halibut was a little over cooked so it was dry on the inside, it could use a sauce on top, the oysters alla Scoma's weren't as good as they used to be. Our waiters were the best thank you Sal and his look a like friend.< /Review>

< review>
We went there on 19 th sept seated and
All very frIedly but there seemed to be friction
When we inquired about the size of the meals
As the ladies were not big eaters it all went downhill from here the waiter became pushy
And condescending sensing we were tourists
Australian when we asked another  question
He grunted “tourist” gave us the bill and walked
Off. Then expect a tip
I feel some education in customer service
Would  be money well spent but rest assured  it
Won’t be ours
The food was good the service  and attitude of the staff was sadly lacking
We won’t be recommending this place purely
Because of the way we were treated .
Walk a couple of 100 meters past the entrance plenty of places 10 times cheaper and better food and friendly Cheerful welcoming staff

<text>Love scomas restaurant. The food is consistently delicious and fresh. The service is wonderful. Views are beautiful and I have not had a menu item that I ever was disappointed with. Stronglyr ecommend this Restaurant over the other wharf restaurants as Scomas food is much superior in quality, taste and with presentation as well. Worth the money spent.<//text><gmapID>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34<//gmapID><rating>5<//rating></record>

Overpriced and mediochre.   We did get excellent service, but $9 draft beers, and a $40 entree that was three tiny pieces of grilled fish and 2 prawns on a bed of orzo and diced veggies?   Gimmee a break.< /Review>

Although the clam chowder soup was tasty, it's missing the sourdough bread bowl. Great views of the water, golden gate bridge and sea lions playing.< /Review>

I was very excited to try this place but I must say it was all hype.  The salmon was grossly over cooked to well-done (dry).  The service was horrible.  My waiter was an elderly man who had trouble hearing but that wasn't a problem.  The problem was that he visited our table once during the entire meal which was only to bring the check.  Catching him while passing by was a task and it was as though we were bothering him.  This a disappointing experience overall but on a positive note my wife enjoyed the roasted whole crab.  Won't be back for sure.</review>

Popped in right before they were closing to grab a couple glasses of wine and some calamari. Best part of the evening is the fact we were driven here in a brand new Bentley flying spur, which was awesome, so it began with us leaving AT&T park after watching USC crush CAL (Fight On), so we proceeded to try and catch a cab, but with no luck we walked down to the  St. Regis to catch a drink and instead were greeted by the doormen offering the house car for a tour of San Francisco. We accepted.
The driver opened the doors to the beautiful car, we got in, and drove us all over the city showing us different sites and telling us a little history about each location, while my fiance and I sat in back worried that we smelled funny after our rooftop tailgate before the game with friends, but he didn't seem to notice, and we certainly weren't going to bring it up.
After he took us to a few wine bars he inquired about our lust for seafood and asked if he could suggest a spot, so we obliged and he took us to Scoma, but not before making sure a table was ready for us. We arrived and were greeted by an amazing staff and enjoyed some great bites to eat while sipping a fantastic Malbec.
The long and short of it is this, we had a great evening with great food and wine, which cannot be beat by much.< /Text>

We visit San Francisco often and seek out good food while we travel. Scomas is a restaurant that was recommended more than once by others.
We finally tried the restaurant and we have to say it is excellent. Ask the waiters what is good and they will advise you...you wont be disappointed.
We tried a few dishes and will make Scomas a regular stop when in S.F.</text>

Very high end but how often can you eat your lunch with such a view. Our waiter Sal was fantastic and the service alone is on point. We ordered the calamari alla pancha which was the perfect amount of spicy. It was accompanied  with a delicous corn bread that balanced out the citrus of the bed of tomato sauce. We also ordered the Pacific Black Cod drizzled in a cream sauce with seasonal vegetables and crispy potatoes. Food was fantastic. Service was amazing. Portion sizes need a bit of work. We still felt a little hungry after our meal. Still a recommended spot.<//review>

<Review>Scoma's, an SF Italian classic.  Bartop review.  Fresh seafood done well.  Skilled artisans as barkeeps.  Casey made a proper Woodford double oaked Manhattan.  The Fritto Misto appetizer had a nice touch of fresh lemon zest on the local and fresh anchovies.  The cioppino entree had a great base and a generous portion of seafood.  Overall a flawless delivery of eats and drinks.  Great service.  Retro modern digs.  Prices more than par for the segment.  Portions more than par.  A hearty 5 stars in the middle of a sea of touristy mediocrity.< /Review>< Rate>

Old school food. The grilled seafood platter was 3 x pieces of Over cooked bland fish. They know how to fill simple dishes. The only good thing is that the sizes where so small so it too painful to eat them. This is ap,ace that is designed for topical America that love cover protein with sauces. I don't understand why it's still so busy. I give this place another 5 years when all their regulars and employees will be dead as they are all so old it's like going into the Madame Trussaud wax museum. The worst dine experience in San Fran I ever had in my many visits.</review>

This is an old restaurant that is trying to be old-style elegant. It isn't anything but old style anymore. Yes, the waiters wear white jackets, but the paneling in the dining room just looks...old. The prices are high, even for Fisherman's Wharf. Typical entree is $30+. The service is not excellent. When we arrived it was a very light Monday night crowd, but the hostess would not seat us until our friend who was parking the car arrived five minutes later. When you are really busy I can see this, but not if the restaurant is more than half empty. The quality of the food is mixed. My wife had lamb chops. Two were excellent, one was raw...and tasteless. I had swordfish in a picatta sauce. The fish was excellent, but the sauce was thin. Bottomline: there are better seafood restaurants at Fisherman's Wharf.<//Text>

I had a couple of adversities at Scoma's restaurant however the manager Matt was very hospitable very friendly and very kind they have a waiter that is the best by the name of Sal I would go there again and recommend this restaurant to others the view is breathtaking it's on the water at Fisherman's Wharf !!!</Review>

<text>Lively atmosphere with much to watch while you wait. Food is a mixed bag: stick with the simple and straightforward seafood dishes.  Service was formal to the point of being punctillious: but also oddlly sneering and suspicious - the only place during a month in the USA to decline my debit card.<//text>< pics>

Oh my goodness,  this restaurant was fabulous.  Everyone was very polite. Our server was one of the best!  He made our visit to the city that much better.  I'm sad to say as writing this I can't recall his name :( though I know all servers here will give the same quality service.  The entrées were delicious.  My steak (their version of Kobe)omg, mouth watering.  The purple potatoes were cooked perfectly!  Soft inside with slightly roasted outside.  I did not add salt or pepper to my meal.  That's a sign it was cooked to perfection. My father's meal was also perfect. Our dessert was decadent.  We will definitely visit Scomas next time we're in the city!<//text>

Food ok. 3 girls will greet you, but too lazy to check and see if there is any room for you to sit down. We were told to go find our own  seats.Why have 3 who do absolutely nothing?<//text>

Good food, location is in the wharf.  Great views.  Interior needs a little updating.< /Review>

Food was ok. Wait was long. We went on a Thursday evening around 6pm. My party of 2 was told 1 hour. We waited an hour and 45 minutes. Service was mediocre at best.</Review>

Although we've visited the Fishermans' Wharf area a few times, we'd never spotted Scoma's before our last visit as it's up an alleyway which we'd always walked past. Wish we'd found it earlier, food good, place busy but good vibe, and staff genuinely pleasant.< /Text>

Great Attention given to customers and great interactions with waiters. If you are a fan of sprite or 7-up ask for the lemon-lime,it is the same good 7-up only without the manufactured taste.</review>

Hopefully it was just a misunderstanding. Our policy, that most top restaurants in town share, is to only seat a party when it is complete. Otherwise, our servers have to come by extra times as the other people arrive, throwing off the entire flow of the restaurant. We hope you understand. However, we offer complimentary valet parking right at our front door so there should never be any wait at all. Hopefully your meal went well when your party arrived and we hope to see you back soon!"}<//Response>< gmap_id>

Scoma's is a legacy, but they are just fundamentally being outgrown. Wish they would pare down the menu, update the decor a little bit, and put a little more attention on the waitstaff's skills.

Service was good, appropriately polite and attentive, but kind of clumsy in execution for the intended ambience. E.g. reaching over other guests to serve plates and grate cheese, or forgetting which plate goes where, or just generally awkward interruptions in table conversation and rushed ordering. To be fair, we sat at the bar tables instead of waiting for our reservation.

Food was good but not great. My Bolognese was obviously fresh but the papardelle was sticking and the sauce wasn't much to write home about. Table bread was cold.

I recognize that I'm likely being picky on the details, but based upon the price of the meal, my expectations were higher.

Not 5 stars, but otherwise a good meal and quality service.</Review>

<review>Smacks of a dying restaurant.  Most of the fish seemed to be from the east coast.  The ingredients  were inexpensive and overcooked, but not inexpensive prices.  The staff was more interested in watching tv at the noisy bar than serving customers.

Fisherman's Wharf has many great restaurants; this is not one of them.</review>< pics>

Very, very good food but not amazing.  Nice decor.  Fun to east on a pier, but the view is of old fishing boats not the water.</Review>

This is my favorite place!  I wasn't a sea food fan at all until I went, ate what they had.  We went back every night, every time I've been in that beautiful city!  Yup, me a meat & potato guy hooked on anything they offered.</text>

<Rating>2</Rating><Review>We were disappointed in the food and the sitting arrangements. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation time but they seated us anyway which was great! However the tables were so close we could not have a private conversation and could certainly hear other table's conversations.  Did not have a nice view either.  The service was pretty good but did not care for the food. Don't get the Dungeness Crab Thermidor Gratinato unless you love onions and not much crab. The Wagyu Bistro Filet was okay and Polenta was good.</Review>< Pics>

Zagat must be slipping... apparently a 25 means: salads made from brown, wilted, store-bought pre-prepared mixes that sat in the back of the fridge too long, mediocre wine selections and crab so overcooked you have to chew on it like a strap of leather.  If you want better seafood, go to a Red Lobster.  Scoma's was singularly terrible in that regard.  No complaints about the atmosphere or the waitstaff though, they did a great job.  It was too bad that when they asked me how everything was, the only nice thing I could say was that the bread was great (and it was).< /Text>

Ordered bistro filet, wagyu sirloin cut with smashed potatoes, and raw sliced carrots. Presentation wasn't great. Carrots were right; raw and edible. Smashed potatoes were right and cooked well. The 9 oz filet by no means looked like 9oz it was dished up cut in half. The temperature of the steak was more like medium than what was ordered which was supposed to be medium rare. I have had more flavorful and more tender steaks at a chain restaurant.

The waiter Chris was nice and courteous.</Text>

Was sold this restraunt as the best seafood Fishermans wharf had to offer . Ordered the three main specialty dishes on the menu. Scallops were to die for. Amazing. But that was about it . For the price , disappointed . For 280 ( 350 AUD) bucks for 4 people. Sydney fish markets could do for about 120 bucks . Maybe my expectations were to high .< /review>

< Review>
Scoma's is a legacy, but they are just fundamentally being outgrown. Wish they would pare down the menu, update the decor a little bit, and put a little more attention on the waitstaff's skills.

Service was good, appropriately polite and attentive, but kind of clumsy in execution for the intended ambience. E.g. reaching over other guests to serve plates and grate cheese, or forgetting which plate goes where, or just generally awkward interruptions in table conversation and rushed ordering. To be fair, we sat at the bar tables instead of waiting for our reservation.

Food was good but not great. My Bolognese was obviously fresh but the papardelle was sticking and the sauce wasn't much to write home about. Table bread was cold.

I recognize that I'm likely being picky on the details, but based upon the price of the meal, my expectations were higher.

Not 5 stars, but otherwise a good meal and quality service.<//Review>

Walked in off the street and had about a 15 minute wait to be seated. It was a fairly busy day so there was no place to sit while we waited. They use a texting service to let you know your table is ready, so we just walked around outside.

We started with the fried calamari and it was very good - they cooked it differently then we've ever had it before - big pieces (great dipping sauce too).

After the calamari, we were all actually pretty full so we weren't as hungry for dinner as we would have liked. We had swordfish, shrimp in egg batter and ahi. All were cooked well and tasted good, but not amazing.

Great views from the restaurant, super service, will come back to try the clam chowder!< /Text>

<review>I ordered the mixed seafood linguini dish which arrived looking appetizing. However, the mussels tasted pungent, the clams didn’t open up all the way, AND the salmon chunks were SPOILED! When I told the waiter about the clams, he gave me a knife to pry them open. I then discovered the spoiled salmon and send the dish back. The writer smelled it and agreed that it had gone bad. A fresh plate came half and hour later and the flavor was good. However, I developed an upset stomach thereafter and my afternoon/ evening was spoiled. I was glad I didn’t feed this to my 1.5 year old toddler. For a restaurant that has a high turnover and claims to be high in quality, this was an awful experience. No one apologized and the full price of the dish was on the bill.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Skip this place. It was recommended to us and we went to this classic and long-established restaurant. A short wait at the bar and we were eating. The service from Jose was friendly, but the food was at best average, and the prices are high ($110 (incl tip) for dinner for 2, no apps or dessert and 2 beer/wine each). The fresh wild salmon was utterly unremarkable, slightly overcooked and with little flavor (I could have easily done better at home any number of ways), and the pasta with sausage was OK but overwhelmed by black olives. Perhaps other things on the menu are better, but at these prices I can't see coming back to eat my way through the menu to find something better than average. Spend your money elsewhere.

Having visited this Scoma's for the first time, in 1985, this place has been incredible every time I have visited it, ever since that time. It would appear that they have adhered to their unremitting dedication to being at the top of their game; and have thrived ever since.< /review>

We were blown away with each dish, from the starters to the deserts; probably one of the finest fish restaurants I ever visited!</review>

I'd give this place a 4.5, if I could. The food was a 4, but the view was a 5! I suggest making reservations and requesting a view, sooner rather than later.<//Review>

Calamari alla Plancha was the best calamari dish I have ever enjoyed. The filet was phenomenal, texture and flavour! Our easier was wonderfully professional and helpful south our orders. The entire experience was FAR above what I expected from anything in the tourist district. This is not a tourist restaurant. They are pros. As a New Orleanean, I know great food and service... and Scoma's delivered!</Text>

Here for a run.  VERY expensive for what you get.  I had the salmon which was good.  They don't accommodate very well in that I couldn't substitute a side.  Has to buy the side with it.< /Review>

We on a whim decided to go to Fisherman's Warf. Found Scoma's and decided we need not go any further. I mean what could be better than eating fresh fish right off the warf. We were not dissapointed!!! The food was amazing best Cod, Scallops,Shrimp, Salad and Fried Calimari ever. Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and a pleasure. Thank you all from Top to Bottom fir your excellence. I will defiantly return. Blessings!!!<//Review>

<Review>I had black cod with lemon aoli over smashed potatoes. Van, our waiter (maybe Dan - older gentleman from Chicago) told me it was good, gave me a description, and I, a lady who doesn't like strong tasting fish, LOVED IT!!!!  We started with soup, my husband had clam chowder, I had the lobster bisque. Excellent start to a wonderful meal. We finished with the 7 layer cake; chocolatey, hazelnutty, creamy, crunchy, but not over sweet. The perfect end to a perfect meal! The only part of the meal not extraordinary was the bread - just ordinary bread that was cold in the center. Thank you Scomas for an absolutely delicious meal. Parking is valet - when you start down Al Scomas Way, go over the bridge, make the turn and the valets take it from there. No charge (we tipped).<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Literally one of the most northern-most places in SF - Scoma's is a seafood-ish restaurant, slightly overpriced, but the food IS delicious. The servers are friendly & affable, the bathroom is kind of crowded, but in general, this is a nice, fancy place - perfect for business lunches/dinners, and maybe romantic dates.< /text>

This is an "Old School" Italian Seafood Restaurant.....perfect.....our two most favorite foods (Italian and Seafood) and we LOVE anything "Old School."
Upon entering.....you immediately get the 60's vibe.  We went for My 50th Birthday lunch....so had every intention of hanging for a bit with a bottle of wine and of course some Birthday dessert.....all those things that really help to run up the bill....and we didn't care one bit. We were seated in the back upper level. The dining room was not very big and they made sure to seat everyone in one section so it was hard to have any real conversation. We ordered a cocktail while looking over the menu. We both decided on Seafood. My husband ordered the Salmon and I ordered the Dungeness Crab Salad, with a bottle of wine to come w/the meal. Our lunches were brought to the table and as soon as the server walked away, my husband looked at his fish and said "this doesn't look good"  I looked at the fish and could see what he was talking about.....it looked so dried out. He took a few bites and it was awful. My salad was ok....it was supposed to be shelled crab. Of course every bite I took, I had to pull shell out of my mouth. Shelled=Means no shell or cartilage. I can understand a bite or two w/shell but this was ridiculous. The server forgot the wine and we were so glad.....because we were so unhappy that we just wanted to get out of there.  We couldn't believe this is what was served for the price. Our bill was was $125......before tip.  We didn't bother to send the food back because we figured everything was going to come out just as bad.  So totally disappointed! I think the chef needs more training or they need to have better quality control. Would NEVER recommend this establishment.</text>

Very interesting seafood joint, off the beaten path. The prices are a bit steep, but I was happy with both the food and service.</Text>

One of the few restaurants in Fisherman's Wharf does does a nice job. The Cioppino is 5 star, other menu favorites are Shrimp and Scallops alla Gannon and Shellfish Sauté Sec.

Only be overpriced knocks them down one star.<//Text>

<review>I have been to Scoma's now four times over the course of nine years. I have had wonderful experiences every time. The views are beautiful and the seafood is GREAT! I have never had such good seafood. I have had the  Dungeness crab cocktail, Gulf shrimp pastina, and the whole dungeness crab. Each of which were AMAZING! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area. I think it goes unrecognized because it is down an alley toward the warf. I will be back sometime again in the future.< /review>< pictures>

We checked online and yelp and found it is a great place to go but very disappointed. Food are not as advertised "fresh" seafood, the seafood looks very frozen prior.....not taste and not too many people there. I will not recommend it. I believe it was a good place and talked to people that night, the restaurant goes downhill recent years.< /Review>

<Text>The food was excellent and so was the service. We didn't have a reservation, so the wait was long, but it allowed us to do some additional walking around at the pier and the food was definitely worth the wait.</Text><Gmap_id>0x808580fc871ec6ad:0x976bca61020dcc34< /Gmap_id><name>Karen Garcia<//name>< response>

Touristy to the max. The food wasn't all that great and our waiter only came by a couple times. We waited for 45 minutes before being seated and the place was extremely crowded. Decor is dated and menu is over priced.</Review>

<Review>Magic... from the service and setting to the reheated leftover linguini democratica  (frutti di mar) the next day.  An absolute gem off the beaten path.  I can't recommend it highly enough.

Years ago, thanks to Bob and Yvonne Whitelock I got to experience this establishment that had been a favorite restaurant for decades.  We had a wonderful meal, experience, and truly enjoyed some San Francisco history.< /review>

Nice seafood,  very good local crab, good wines by the glass,  friendly and efficient staff.  Price vs quality probably not bad for the area although overpriced in my view. Would definitely recommend it though if you're in the area.<//text>

<Text>Went to resturant on recomendation. Expected fresh fish off the boat but they had none. No specials. Food was overpriced, but your paying for the area. Waiter was a older gentelman and very surley, service was sub par. Location was great. The meals that were ordered were fast and of average quality. I would not recomend.</Text><UserId.>108482803174686152346<//UserId.>< gmap_id>

Gang:

This Restaurant is tops, the sourdough frenchbread is the best!!

Yes it is busy but so are all great places... so be smart if you are going to be on the Wharf, make rez & go window shopping & come back in an hour enjoy it dont sweat it.

But.... I hate the rez booth up 4-5 feet above your head ..."strange"
Bottomline after dinner go to the Buena Vista a few blocks away!!

Have a great time Mike #32< /text>

{'time': 1592014083583, 'text': "Yuri, if you are referring to the issue FV Pioneer has brought up, please know Scoma's has long been one of, if not the biggest supporters of the local fishing fleet, including FV Pioneer. Below is a statement from the Port of San Francisco outlining the facts of the situation:\nThis is a COVID-19 public safety issue now that Scoma’s can offer outdoor dining on their leasehold. Moreover, FV Pioneer has no claim to operate retail fish sales on property that Scoma’s leases.\nScoma’s voluntarily agreed to allow a portion of their leasehold to be temporarily used since 2017 without costs to FV Pioneer for retail fish sales as a good neighbor supporting local fishers. Otherwise, the FV Pioneer would not have been able to operate a fish retail business without the cooperation of Scoma’s and the Port.\nScoma’s can no longer accommodate FV Pioneer retail fish sales on its property due to health and social distancing guidelines. The City has offered new opportunities for restaurants, whose doors have been shuttered for the past three months, to operate outdoor dining in efforts to stem the financial hardship that the virus has caused on the restaurant industry.\nScoma’s and FV Pioneer attempted to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. As no solution has presented itself, the Port must support Scoma’s claims to use the property they are leasing from the Port. Thus, the FV Pioneer can berth there but it may no longer make retail sales.\n\nThank you for your interest and please contact the Port of San Francisco if you have any questions regarding this situation."}</resp>

We've been to Scoma's many times over the years while visiting San Francisco and have always enjoyed our meals here, but we were disappointed on this trip. The service as always was outstanding, but the food was not as good as it has been in the past. Lots of money for lunch that was at best mediocre.< /text>

<Review>Outrageously overrated. Anyone who likes this place must usually eat at the Olive Garden. The wait staff was disinterested at best, and for the (stupidly high) price the food was unimpressive. Eat there if you must, but there are better places.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Water was not served 10 minutes after seated down. Server did not pick up order for at least 15 minutes. Not recommended this place for its awful service.<//Review>

Fun place to have a meal- walls are filled with celebrities that have eaten there.  Service was good, food was good but overpriced.  I would eat there again.<//Review>

My family highly recommended I eat the freshest fish of the day, and I am so glad I did! The clam chowder, IPA, and Halibut with a view of the Golden gate bridge at Golden hour was something special!</Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Great service from the charming waiters in a fish restaurant, in whose nostalgic interior you immediately lose yourself :-) If you want to go out to eat in style without dressing too chic, this is the place for you. Portions are big enough, prices are high for German standards (a large shrimp salad around 45 euros), but tasty.

(Original)
Super Service durch die charmanten Kellner in einem Fischrestaurant, in dessen nostalgischem Interieur man sich sofort verliert :-) wer stilvoll Essengehen möchte, ohne sich dafür zu chic kleiden zu wollen, ist hier richtig. Portionen sind ausreichend  groß, Preise sind für deutsche Verhältnisse gehoben (ein großer Krabbensalat um die 45 Euro), dennoch lecker.< /Text><UserId.>109184731245699672377<//UserId.>< resp>

<text>(Translated by Google) We stopped by for lunch. It was delicious seafood. Share salad, clam chowder, and today's seafood grill one by one, just right. I ordered a glass of beer for this and it cost $ 100 including a tip. The price is high, but I am satisfied with the taste and service.

看到很多好吃的評論，我們特地開車過來吃，價格昂貴沒有關係，只要海鮮是新鮮好吃，一切都值得，但事實並不如此，結帳快200多美金，螃蟹不是新鮮的，天啊！我們可是吃新鮮螃蟹長大的啊！<//Text></record>

The sunset outside the window is paired with simple and extraordinary food
An endless stream of people, full of the human touch of the store
I don’t feel messy, but warm and relaxed

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The food is good, especially the crab sauce fried garlic cream is delicious, but the food price is very expensive, the service staff is older, the age of guests is also higher, creating a traditional American-style human service, more suitable for older people . Expensive is the only disadvantage I have seen. After the meal, lemon and hot towel will be provided.

(Original)
食物不錯，尤其螃蟹的醬料炸蒜香奶油很好吃，但是食物價格很貴，服務人員年齡偏高，客人年齡層也偏高，營造出傳統美式富有人情味的服務，較適合年長的人。貴是我看到的唯一缺點。用餐完會提供檸檬跟熱毛巾。< /Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) A well-known seafood restaurant recommended by local Americans, one each in San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf and Sausalito Beach. It is a little historical and word-of-mouth restaurant. When we arrived it was more than three in the afternoon, there were no one, the service was very kind and very experienced and recommended dishes. The taste is very good, the seafood is fresh, and the wine selection is also many, and the overall price is high

美國當地人推薦的知名海鮮餐廳，在舊金山漁人碼頭和Sausalito海邊各有一間店，是間有點歷史且有口碑的餐廳。我們到的時候是下午三點多，沒有什麼人，服務很客氣很好，也很有經驗的推薦菜色。口味很好，吃的出海鮮的新鮮，供應的酒選擇也不少，整體價位偏高<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) A classic Italian seafood restaurant on the water in San Francisco. They have a great selection of fish, seafood, crab and a single steak.
The dishes are on the expensive end - $ 35-40 for a main course, but the portions are large so you can plentifully settle for a lunch. We got Linguine alla Vongole and Pasta Putanesca. The wine is pricey and OK. The beers are cheaper. Their double IPA is fantastic. Try a cocktail while you wait. The lemon kiss (Bacio al Limone) is excellent.
The service is classic, good and attentive.
Can be recommended if you can afford it.

En klassisk italiensk seafood restaurant på vandet i San Francisco. De har et stort udvalg af fisk, skaldyr, krabbe og en enkelt bøf.
Retterne er i den dyre ende - 35-40$ for en hovedret, men portionerne er store, så man kan rigeligt nøjes med en ret til frokost. Vi fik Linguine alla Vongole og Pasta Putanesca . Vinen er dyr og OK. Øllene er billigere. Deres double IPA er fantastisk. Smag gerne en cocktail, mens du venter. Citronkys (Bacio al Limone) er fremragende.
Betjeningen er klassisk, god og opmærksom.
Kan anbefales, hvis man har råd til det.<//Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Seafood restaurant located in the port of San Francisco. The quality of the food quite bad, products without flavor, the spaghetti vongole undercooked and with a lot of liquid (we assume that they were not drained). The cesar salad was 4 regular lettuce leaves and 4 very salty croutons. Seafood quite tasteless. Very expensive for its quality and the living room needs updating after years.

(Original)
Restaurante marisquería situado en el puerto de San Francisco. La calidad de la comida bastante mala, productos sin sabor, los espaguetis vongole mal cocinados y con mucho líquido (suponemos de no haberlos escurrido). La ensalada cesar eran 4 hojas de lechuga regulares y con 4 crustones muy salados. El marisco bastante insípidos. Muy caro para su calidad y el salón necesita una reforma después de años.</review>

(Translated by Google) Seafood at Pier 39 is a high end. Of course you can enter comfortably without the dress code. There is a little price. 2 beer, 2 appetizers, 2 mains, 160 for US $ 200,000

Chiofino delicious! Kkalra Marie Fries, Cram chowder is also good
The grill is saw

Pyeonyira weighted long side haldeut reservations. If you search a beer or a cocktail at the bar while waiting. Immediately gave instructions do not just sit down to wait in the bar located off the table when the zoom menu

피어 39 에서 해산물 음식으로는 하이엔드. 물론 드레스 코드 없이 편하게 들어갈 수 있음. 가격은 조금 있는편. 맥주2, 에피타이저 2, 메인 2, 하면 한국 돈 20만원 정도 달러로는 160 (팁 포함)

치오피노 맛있음! 깔라마리 튀김, 크램차우더도 굿
그릴은 쏘쏘

웨이팅이 긴편이라 예약이 편할듯. 기다리는 동안 바에서 맥주나 칵테일 한잔하면 됨. 따로 바로 안내는 안해주니 그냥 바 자리에 앉아서 테이블 기다린다고 하면 메뉴 줌< /Review>

The truth is that we will repeat when we return to San Francisco.
The Bloody Mary is very good.
The place is well located and the service is very good and very attentive.

(Translated by Google) A really nice local authentic American beach restaurant in a slightly secluded location, Mainly with Italian food. The price range is not even high compared to local prices. The taste, on the other hand, is great. The service is very nice. You can always chat with other guests.

(Original)
Egy igazán szép helyi autentikus amerikai tengerparti étterem, kicsit eldugott helyen, Főként olasz ételekkel. Az árfekvés a helyi árakhoz képest nem is magasak. Az ízvilág viszont nagyszerű. Nagyon kedves a kiszolgálás. Mindig lehet beszélgetni a többi vendéggel is.<//Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) We went to the restaurant at around 10/19 pm this year, ordered a bottle of sparkling water, and also had two children to dine. During the period, the mouth was very thirsty, but we found that there was water and bread on the table around us. I don't know if it's because we are Asian, the whole feeling is very bad! ! The service is not in place, the overall restaurant tastes OK but the cost is too expensive!

(Translated by Google) It is in a place where you can feel the refreshing sea breeze. A famous seafood restaurant on the east coast of the United States. The waiting time was very long, but I think it's definitely worth the wait. Enjoy NAPA wines and fresh seafood. The price is not cheap, but the seasoning of the food and the atmosphere inside the restaurant go beyond that. It is a high-quality shop with a high degree of satisfaction. Satisfaction, satisfaction, great satisfaction Thank you for your treat. If you have a chance to go to the United States on the west coast, you definitely want to visit this one.

(Original)
爽やかな海風を感じられる場所にあります。アメリカ東海岸で有名なシーフードレストランです。待ち時間はとても長かったのですが、間違いなく待つ価値はあると思います。NAPAのワインと新鮮な海の幸を堪能できます。価格だけ見たら安くはありませんが、料理の味付け、店内の雰囲気はそれを越えます。満足度の高い良質なお店です。満足、満足、大満足ご馳走さまでした。西海岸に渡米する機会がおれば必ず訪問したい一軒ですね。</review>

(Translated by Google) Raw oysters, clam chowder, it was very delicious.

Crabs are delicious, but Japan is delicious.
The crab may not have been a delicious season, but considering the price, I personally feel that it is not at a level that I recommend.
However, since crabs with garlic oil have never been eaten in Japan, there are times when you experience it. It is delicious to eat the remaining garlic oil in the pan.

The mixed seafood grill was delicious, but the taste is within the expected range, not until it breaks the expectations.
As for the Japanese people, after all seafood has a high level, ..., strengthened the completely selfish personal view.

(If you don't compare it to the food in Hokkaido, it's delicious enough. I think it's good enough if you're hoping to be able to feel that there's also delicious seafood in the US.)

(Original)
生牡蠣、クラムチャウダー、とても美味しかったです。

カニは、まあ美味しいけど、日本のが美味しいかなー。
カニが美味しい旬の時期ではなかったのかもですが、値段を考えると必ずおすすめするほどのレベルにまでにはない気が個人的にはします。
ただ、ガーリックオイルでのカニは日本では食べたことがなかったので、経験しておくのもありでしょう。残ったガーリックオイルをパンにつけて食べるのは美味しいですよ。

ミックスシーフードグリルも美味しかったけど、期待の範囲内の美味しさで、期待を突き破るまでではなく、、、
日本人のがやっぱりシーフードはレベルが高いかな、、、との全く勝手な個人的見解を強めました。

(北海道での食事と比較しなければ、十分に美味しいですよ。アメリカでも美味しいシーフードがあるんだなという気持ちになれることを期待しての訪問なら十分に良いと思います。)</text>

<username>S S< /username><Text>(Translated by Google) The location is very good. Clam chowder has many ingredients and it is delicious, but I felt a lot of saltiness (depending on taste). I went there in winter, but oysters are very small, I think that they are not very satisfied if they are Japanese oyster lovers. It may be unusual for clams to eat raw clams. Seafood fried was quite tasty. The beer was not very cold. The staff who corresponded was very kind.

(Original)
ロケーションはとても良いです。クラムチャウダーは具も多くておいしいのですのですが、私には少し塩分が多い気がしました（好みにもよると思います）。冬期に行ったのですが、牡蠣はとても小さく、日本の牡蠣好きの方だとあまり満足できないのではないかと思います。ハマグリの生が食べられるのは珍しいかもしれません。シーフードフライはなかなかおいしかったです。ビールはあまり冷えてなかったです。対応してくれたスタッフはとても親切でした。<//Text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) If you want to try fresh, good quality fish and seafood of all kinds, this is the place for you. The restaurant gets its fish directly from the fishing boats. It couldn't be fresher! The price is high, but you also get extremely good service. Very friendly waiters who also help with the selection of the dishes. If you don't want to wait, a reservation is required.
For two people, we paid $ 120 for a full meal, including a tip.

(Original)
Wer frischen, qualitativ guten Fisch und Meeresfrüchte aller Art probieren will, ist hier richtig. Das Restaurant bekommt seinen Fisch direkt von den Fischerbooten. Frischer geht es nicht! Der Preis ist gehoben, dafür bekommt man aber auch einen außerordentlich guten Service. Sehr freundliche Kellner die auch bei der Auswahl der Speisen zur Seite stehen. Wenn man nicht warten will ist eine Reservierung erforderlich.
Für 2 Personen haben wir für eine volle Mahlzeit inkl. Trinkgeld 120 Dollar bezahlt.<//text>

(Translated by Google) I state that during my stay in the States, speaking as an Italian, I had a lot of difficulty eating well as we do in Italy, even at renowned restaurants. In this case, however, I have to say that expectations have been largely met. excellent Sicilian dishes, oysters spectacular and best American ever drank white wine. To try.

(Original)
Premetto che durante il soggiorno negli States, parlando da italiano, ho avuto parecchie difficoltà nel mangiar bene come da noi in Italia, anche presso ristoranti blasonati. In questo caso però, devo dire che le aspettative sono state ampiamente soddisfatte. Piatti siciliani ottimi, Ostriche spettacolari e miglior vino bianco statunitense mai bevuto. Da provare.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Very good restaurant in Fisherman's Wharf, a little out of the way in the middle of the boats. Fresh and well prepared fish. A bit expensive anyway but we wanted to have fun and in the end, a very good experience so I recommend it.

Très bon resto à Fisherman's Wharf, un peu à l'écart au milieu des bateaux. Poisson frais et bien préparé. Un peu cher quand même mais on a voulu se faire plaisir et en fin de compte, très bonne expérience alors je le recommande.</text>

(Translated by Google) Because this meal has a great impression on Fisherman's Wharf, it is not enough to eat all the seafood services that you want to eat about 45 knives per person. The crab is very fat and the lobster is also tender and tender. Because I wanted to eat butter mushroom sauce and want to eat onion sauce, the chef specially made these three kinds of sauces for us, which was surprisingly delicious. It was a bit unpleasant to find a seat at first, but then another grandfather asked us in detail about what we wanted to eat and how to do it. Specifically, we changed the plate and pepper for many times, and asked for a good meal at the right time. Sour bread is free and there is a free lemon hot handkerchief, which is always recommended by conscience!

(Original)
因为这顿饭对渔人码头印象超棒啊，人均45刀左右能吃到所有想吃的海鲜服务没得说。螃蟹非常肥美龙虾也是外焦里嫩。因为既想吃奶油蘑菇酱又想吃洋葱酱，主厨为我们特意做了这三样酱汁混合的，出奇意料的好吃。一开始找座子有点不愉快，但是之后又一位大爷为我们详细询问介绍我们想吃什么以及怎么做。特意为我们换了好多次盘子加胡椒粉，在恰到好处的时间来询问是否用餐愉快。酸面包是免费的还有免费的柠檬热手帕，总而言之良心推荐！</Review>

All of San Francisco is very expensive, and our prices are based on our using the highest-quality, most sustainable seafood available. We support small local fishermen and only use seafood that meets or exceeds the high standards set by the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program. We feel a responsibility to do so and even so, our prices are still in line with other restaurants in town with similar high levels of service. Unfortunately, most restaurants opt for the least expensive seafood they can source, but we know our customers appreciate our efforts and we hope to see you back again.

(Translated by Google) Really everything very good. Book by appointment because there are usually many people to eat (at least in August). As I say, every dish is more than delicious, although accustomed to the prices of Spain perhaps I saw it a bit expensive. But we already know that the United States is like that.

To eat good fish, I don't think there is any better place in Fisherman's Warf.

(Original)
Realmente todo muy bueno. Reservar con cita previa porque suele haber mucha gente para comer ( como mínimo en Agosto ). Como digo, todo plato está más que delicioso, aunque acostumbrado a los precios de España quizás lo ví un poco caro. Pero ya sabemos que estados unidos es así.

Para comer buen pescado, no creo que haya ningún sitio mejor en Fisherman's Warf.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Escape from the rush of the promenade crowd by forking in this alley that leads you to the docks, in the middle of small fishing boats ... There you will find Scoma's, a chic (but affordable) restaurant where stars, including Marilyn Monroe, liked to go ...
A warm welcome, a pleasant atmosphere, a nice view and delicious fish specialties. The restaurant has its own fishing fleet.

French: think of the tip by adding 15-20% to the note presented (10% if the service was bad, but there, it will surprise me).

Évadez-vous de la cohue de la foule de la promenade en bifurquant dans cette ruelle qui vous amène sur les quais, au milieu de petits bateaux de pêche… Là, vous trouverai Scoma’s, un restaurant chic (mais abordable) où des stars, dont Marilyn Monroe, aimaient aller…
Un accueil des plus chaleureux, un ambiance agréable, une jolie vue et des spécialités de poissons délicieuses. Le restaurant possède sa propre flotte de pêche.

Français : pensez au pourboire en ajoutant 15-20 % à la note présentée (10 % si le service était mauvais, mais là, ça m’étonnerai).<//text>

{'time': 1592014223974, 'text': 'Dmitry,  it seems like you are referring to the issue FV Pioneer has brought up. Please know Scoma\'s has long been one of, if not the biggest supporters of the local fishing fleet, including FV Pioneer. Below is a statement from the Port of San Francisco outlining the facts of the situation:\n\n"This is a COVID-19 public safety issue now that Scoma’s can offer outdoor dining on their leasehold. Moreover, FV Pioneer has no claim to operate retail fish sales on property that Scoma’s leases.\nScoma’s voluntarily agreed to allow a portion of their leasehold to be temporarily used since 2017 without costs to FV Pioneer for retail fish sales as a good neighbor supporting local fishers. Otherwise, the FV Pioneer would not have been able to operate a fish retail business without the cooperation of Scoma’s and the Port.\nScoma’s can no longer accommodate FV Pioneer retail fish sales on its property due to health and social distancing guidelines. The City has offered new opportunities for restaurants, whose doors have been shuttered for the past three months, to operate outdoor dining in efforts to stem the financial hardship that the virus has caused on the restaurant industry.\nScoma’s and FV Pioneer attempted to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. As no solution has presented itself, the Port must support Scoma’s claims to use the property they are leasing from the Port. Thus, the FV Pioneer can berth there but it may no longer make retail sales."\n\nThank you for your interest and please contact the Port of San Francisco if you have any questions regarding this situation.'}</Response>

{'time': 1592014209971, 'text': 'Kristina, it seems like you are referring to the issue FV Pioneer has brought up. Please know Scoma\'s has long been one of, if not the biggest supporters of the local fishing fleet, including FV Pioneer. Below is a statement from the Port of San Francisco outlining the facts of the situation:\n\n"This is a COVID-19 public safety issue now that Scoma’s can offer outdoor dining on their leasehold. Moreover, FV Pioneer has no claim to operate retail fish sales on property that Scoma’s leases.\nScoma’s voluntarily agreed to allow a portion of their leasehold to be temporarily used since 2017 without costs to FV Pioneer for retail fish sales as a good neighbor supporting local fishers. Otherwise, the FV Pioneer would not have been able to operate a fish retail business without the cooperation of Scoma’s and the Port.\nScoma’s can no longer accommodate FV Pioneer retail fish sales on its property due to health and social distancing guidelines. The City has offered new opportunities for restaurants, whose doors have been shuttered for the past three months, to operate outdoor dining in efforts to stem the financial hardship that the virus has caused on the restaurant industry.\nScoma’s and FV Pioneer attempted to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. As no solution has presented itself, the Port must support Scoma’s claims to use the property they are leasing from the Port. Thus, the FV Pioneer can berth there but it may no longer make retail sales."\n\nThank you for your interest and please contact the Port of San Francisco if you have any questions regarding this situation.'}< /Response>
