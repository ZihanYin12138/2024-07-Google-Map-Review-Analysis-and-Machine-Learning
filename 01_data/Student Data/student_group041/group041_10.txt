Marge, Jack, and Julie all did a great job for us.  They helped us navigate through a refinance with care and professionalism.  They kept us well informed, answered all of our questions, and ensured the process remained on track.  Would we recommend them?  We already have, and would not hesitate to do so again!!< /Text>

I highly recommend American Pacific Mortgage Co.! We had such a wonderful experience working with Marge and Jack. As first time homebuyers, we were very nervous about the process. We appreciate their responsiveness and detailed explanations throughout our loan process. We found our dream home in a sellers market and the process was incredibly smooth.<//Text>

We've worked with Michele Reen to refinance our home a couple times over the past decade and we couldn't be happier with her service. Both personable and professional throughout the entire process, she found an awesome rate with a credible lender and once locked, Michele checked in frequently, both by email and by phone, to make sure we stayed on track and provided all the necessary documents and reviews/signatures on time. Highly recommended :)<//review>

<review>My wife and I worked with Michele and her team to help get into a 30 year fixed that really could help us out financially.  For us this was a 2 year journey after being in a adjustable rate and just coming out of a bankruptcy.
Michele and her team worked with us to get a fixed rate that was lower than our adjustable but, most of all kept the rate from moving up for us.  Then helped us work on our credit score and the next steps to getting a really great new 30 year fixed.  Everyone on the Reen team were always friendly, accommodating and truly worked to help us get to where we wanted to be.  Thank you so very much Michele and your whole team.< /review>< pics>

<Date>1599849061045<//Date><Rating>5</Rating><Text>Only because rates were so good, we decided to refinance our mortgage. On the recommendation of family we chose American Pacific Mortgage to be our agent. Michele Reen served as our agent in the process.
Michele did a great job for us and got us an even better rate than we hoped for. Except for signing with a notary, the whole process happened on-line. It was amazing. We communicated with Michele multiple times per week through the process. She was responsive to any and all questions and concerns we had. Michele has something of a cheerleader demeanor. She’s positive, reassuring, energetic, knowledgeable, friendly and transparent.
While We wouldn’t go so far as to say refinancing a mortgage is fun, our experience with Michele and APM was about as good as it gets - friendly, efficient, positive and with a great outcome. We recommend her.

Michele Morse Reen and her Reen Team staff at APM are the absolute best at what they do. Since 1998, they have handled our original mortgage loan and seven (yes, SEVEN!) re-fis, as interest rates dropped steadily over the decades. When they say they are "your Lender ... for Life!" they mean it. They are always looking out for your best interests and treat you with friendly professionalism. You can't go wrong with Michele because she and her team never go wrong themselves. The Reen Team is the real deal!</review>

I've worked with Marge Nogosek and her firm since 1994 and she just help us complete a refinance on our current home. Having owned several homes and having been a Realtor myself, I can confidently stay that Marge is one of the very best in the business. She's extremely knowledgeable and professional. Working with Marge means you never have to worry that anything less than her best effort effort is being made on your behalf. I'll continue to use and recommend Marge to anyone looking for one of the best loan agents in the valley.<//review>

I had a great experience with American Pacific Mortgage. Marge Nogosek is fantastic! She made my refinancing of my home easy! When I was considering this move, Marge had given me a call about refinancing. It was like she had read my mine. When I first purchased my home, Marge made the experience smooth and easy! My decision was a no brainer. Thank you Marge for all you’ve done for me these years! Appreciate you!<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Being that we were first time buyers, we were first a little intimidated by the whole process. Our first step was attending the Reen Team's homebuyers workshop, in those two hours we learned a lot and knew what we needed to do before even beginning the pre-approval process!
Michele's team has decades of experience in the financial business, and they helped us navigate which loan would be the best for us; they even took the time to help us do some quick improvements to increase our credit score, qualifying us for the best interest rate. Our experience overall was so personal, we weren't just a number to hit, as you find with big bank names. Michele goes above and beyond. The Reen team ensures that you will get the best loan, the lowest rate, and it's all done in a quick, professional and un-stressful manner.
We just closed on our house and not only do we have a new home, we have new friends, Michele and her team!!< /Text>< Pics>

We really appreciated that Marge was available for questions at all times. Most of all Marge was forthright and honest. If we had to start the process over, we would definitely pick Marge again.<//Review>

This is my second time working with American Pacific Mortgage. First time was for my home purchase, second time for my refi. Like before, this was a great experience. Thanks.<//review>

Great team of people to work with whether you are buying a home or refinancing. Our refi was a breeze!!  Could not be any happier. Michele, Cassie, Mike, and the rest of the time are awesome. Great rates too!! I highly recommend American Pacific Mortgage.</text>

The Reen Team is more than exceptional.   They went above and beyond our expectations.  High energy, caring, they really make you feel part of the family and will do what it takes to get you in your new home.  Now that our family has found our dream home, we will truly miss working with the Reen Team.    We recommend everyone to work with Thurro Realty and The Reen Team at American Pacific Mortgage if you want an easy, quick process with really great people.< /text>

Through every mortgage need and transaction since, Michele and her amazing team have been there every step of the way! No need is too big and every small detail is accounted for.

Our refi was a smooth and bump free process. Michelle and her team were always easy to get in touch with. I always felt our best interest was the main object. The team are friendly and helpful. I would reccommend them to anyone. Thanks for such a good experience.</review>

The Reen Team reached out to us about refinancing when the interest rate dropped significantly. They made it simple and easy to respond with e-documents and having the notary coming to us. We feel Michele and crew are looking out for us long-term, not just as a one-time deal! We trust them totally.</Text>

<Review>It's a good spot I like it they get you in the door and done. Friendly and good to to deal with, plus they have a scale near by
It is ten dollars and they take credit cards aswell as cash.
In my opinion it's a  good place it's clean lots of parking.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>The Community Center hands out meals to seniors on Mondays, (food for 2 days) & Wednesdays,  (food for 3 days).  Meals our handed out at 11:30 am.  Walk-ins & drive through.  I suggest you get there between 10-10:30 am.  Limited amount of meals.  Staff is great, very well organized.   Great facility.< /text><Time>1590154199097</Time></record></dataset><record>

Customer service: 9/10 it’s honestly a hit or miss... the people that work there are generally helpful but there’s a couple of bad apples and obviously that doesn’t represent the company as a whole.

Prices: 10/10 they’re great I don’t have to drive to la for crapping materials and overpricing products

Quality: 10/10

Cash only</text>

Great products and customer service! Love the variety of products they carry in the warehouse. I bought chairs, tables, EZ UP canopy, patio lights, runners, piñata and table cloths for personal use at home. Glad I was able to find them online. Next purchase might be more chairs and tables and maybe even a jumper for gatherings at home.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Prices are reasonable and the variety of units they offer are many. Don't buy bouncers right away but buy accessories. I liked the store.

Just a bit upset had to get everything done outside I know the virus and all. I just would've preferred my pedicure inside it's more relaxing with the spa tub and all vs a little basin. We were squeezed in last min appreciate that as it's hard stopping as a trucker to enjoy things like this. Only other issue my pinky nail fell off the next day so was bummed about that. But they were cute 🤗</Review>< time>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>While getting my nails done the nail tech was rough and nicked me maybe twice. She was rushing and doing a really sloppy job. When asked if they could do what I requested she confirmed that she could and proceeded to do the complete opposite. When speaking with the manager I told her that I wasn’t happy with my nails and I also requested a different nail tech she then said yes. After they had me sit for like 10 min she gave me the same nail tech and when I said I wanted someone else she then denied me that and I ended up having the same lady. I told her I wanted my nails fixed and all she did was take off the polish and added more acrylic. My cuticles were not fixed they are flooded still and my nails are crooked I’m very unhappy with the service and they were very unprofessional. I do not recommend them to anyone.<//Text>< gmap_id>

I called 15 minutes ahead and said if I’m there in 10 minutes will you be able to see me? Is it busy? And they said no if you come now we can help you. I show up 10 minutes later and she tells me it’s a half hour wait. Mmm, no thanks.</Review>

The service is bad, they personally overprice, specially the head nail tech Wendy, and the quality of their products are cheap. My mother tried doing the dip powder to reserve her nails and within three days her nails were chipping. When I brought it up to the nail tech all she did was ask who did my moms nails. Not once offered to fix it. Another visit I asked for white tip nails and noticed that Wendy charged me 10$ more than what the price said on the price board even though I came in with my nails already cut, with no polish and did not ask for gel. I catch myself leaving disappointed every time I get my nails done at this location and I’ve had enough. It’s time to move to a different location.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

They did a beautiful job. I was stuck between two acrylic colors and she helped me figure out which on I liked better by actually trying it on a separate nail. She made sure everything was perfect before putting on gloss.</review>

<user>101099124276832623392< /user><Date>1557859677254</Date><text>I came in with preshaped nails for them to paint, so it would be a regular manicure. They overcharged by a lot. But besides their overpricing, they don’t paint nails right. I wanted an ombré, all white with glitter. 💆‍♀️ It was extremely bulky on the tips and it completely ruined the shape I came in with. I had to file my nails down by some cm. I was so sad. They also moved me right after I got my pedicure, which ruined one of the toes because it wasn’t dry. I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible because the quality of service was so bad :(< /text>< Response>

Went today for 2 pedicures and a full set (for my daughter who's 12 got them done fir a wedding) pedicures were great but when the lady brought the bill 38 for my daughters full set. 38?!!! For what? Well I go and ask why she said gel and powder. Ummm, excuse me we didn't ask for that. Then another lady says 5dollar discount for you if you want the powder . ummm nooo!!  Dont try to give me something I didn't ask for and expect me to pay for it.  So ended up paying 28 for her nails. So be sure you are being charged for what you want and not for something you didn't ask for.</text>

I went to do my nails and I felt so uncomfortable. Kim was doing my nails and I will never go back there again. Good nails just worse service. I already have low self esteem I don’t need people talking the whole time and looking at my feet laughing. Also she asked me to tip so felt obligated to tip. Wish I hadn’t.</Text>

Extremely rude. My mother and 3 year old daughter went here. Long story short, my mother had asked for a cup of water for my daughter and the worker replied rudely "can you wait?". My sister vouched on rudeness and the staff is very pushy on trying to add designs on your nails even if you tell them you want a solid color.< /review>

This place is bad first time, (for pedicures and manicure and gel color $39.00 and $1.00 fee for debit card)and I asked for lavender and when they pull out the nail polish it was old and clumpy and the brush didn't even take the color In to my nail, so she put more water in the nail polish bottle. Then the pedicure was so cheep no massage just put small amount of lotion on my feet then she ask for more money as for scrape some skin witch I don't have so I said no thanks. So putting the nail color bad old and clumps on my feet then it was really bad and she lie she said it was gel it wasn't it was just clear nail polish on top of the old nail polish. She lie. Manicure awful same color bad on my nail not massage and bad attitude. One of my nail didn't take the color the I told her she said so Gary I put the oil already. So I told her fix it this people are liar and they are very cheap with there product. To much money for old cheep and full service. You want to waist money and have bad service please go there.
I will never ever go to them ever bad service and liars.......< /Text>

I love Loan, the main girl there. I think she's the manager. I've been getting acrylic nails for 25 years and am extremely picky, and she does a fabulous job.  I can't vouch for the job the other girls do, but Loan is great. I live in Glendora, work in Riverside, and I always get my nails done in Riverside even though there are about 5 nail salons within a half mile of my house.  No complains about Diamond nails at all!<//Text>

The lady who did my nails was nice. She used a nail shaving machine to take off gel which made my nails super thin and flimsy. Two of my nails broke less than a day later. Really disappointed.<//review>

<review>so first of all i went in for a gel manicure and the lady was so rude, my nails look so bad that my coworkers asked if my 2 year old daughter did my nails but i didnt make a big deal of it and just kind fixed them with nail polish remover. Today they started getting stuck on my hair beacause the gel was lifting so as i started removing them i noticed green on MY NAIL now i can possibly have fungus !!!!!<//review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dcae3b5ff8cc7d:0x53c50dbf9475f261< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Super disappointed. I went in for a design that was on their Instagram, first of all I made an appointment 3 weeks in advance confirming the day before so that the lady could be 45 minutes late. Then she tells me that I should not get the design I went in for because it was posted just for looks. Continued to tell me negative things about the design until I decided on something else that I've gotten in the past and was over priced. Went in feeling good to get pampered for my birthday and left unsatisfied.< /text><GmapID>0x80dcae3b5ff8cc7d:0x53c50dbf9475f261<//GmapID>< pictures>

Super horrible, lady changed my nail color, missed sides of my nails! They did my mother’s and they left a side of her nail drippy and the other side dry with not much product on them! And they were too expensive for such ugly nails, don’t recommend going there at all!</review>

Do Not go here !!!!!!!! They are overpriced and you don’t even get what you ask for ! They file your skin more than they file the nail. My cuticles are sore and tender because of it. Only waited 5 minutes to be served but it Should never take 4 hours for a full set and color change , only came here because my regular nail shop was closed today. NEVER AGAIN !<//Review>

<text>Michele was wonderful. She did go above and beyond with helping me locating my insurance company! Also, Dr.Patel was very calm, informative and answered all my questions and concerns. The whole time I was there, I did feel important 😉

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>I came in for an eye exam and glasses as a new customer. The eye doctor was really sweet; I liked her very much. Some of the LensCrafters staff were really friendly and easy to chat with. Others were not.
I didn’t realize I’d get my glasses within a couple of hours, which was a nice surprise. I was a little disappointed by the frame selection, but I suppose it’s a trade off for such quick turnaround.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>My eye exam was good. I really liked the doctor. The person helping me before and after seeing the doctor was very helpful. Everything was very clean and safe. The glasses I wanted were just too expensive for me to buy there. Even with a substantial discount given at LensCrafters I was able to buy similar glasses for $300 cheaper at Costco.</Review>< Response>

Too bad. Went in to look at frames. Waited in line at the front for social distanced, woman said ill be right with you. 20 mins later with an entire turn around of customers in the store no one. Walked out. They don't care. Too bad<//review>

I ordered som glasses when I was then and was told they would be in in about a week so I called a week later to find out they weren't ordered yet and they would be in in a week. So I called back again to see if they were in yet and they said they still weren't ordered yet. Here it has been 3 weeks and I paid $650 for a pair of glasses they they won't ordered and they won't give me my money back so I am forced to call a lawyer</text>< pics>

<Review>We've been going here the last 2 years. We do eye exams here and they helped my 8 year old do contacts for sports- they were extremely patient with him and when they remembered him, it made him smile. Great customer service and it's nice to see multiple same staff still work here.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Michelle and the staff were amazing! An emergency had us in a pinch 5 hours before an event, lost glasses! They rallied and got us in with an updated prescription AND glasses ready in a little over an hour! SAVED by the LensCrafters crew of Galleria Mall! Thank you so much!</Review>

<review>LensCrafters has created a very poor customer experience. My eye appointment was an hour behind schedule where I waited in a back hallway wondering if I was forgotten. The employees were running around inefficiently with every step of the process requiring long waits and poor customer service. I guess COVID is the all encompassing excuse to provide bad service and completely let your business model go off the rails. My wife and I agree we won’t ride this pain train again.<//review>< Pics>

This store cares more about a sale and helping a customer out. I walked in and was not greeted. Only was looked at by the person that signs you I’m. I looked at the glasses then I found two pairs I liked and carried them in my hand. I then made eye contact with the person that signes you in three times until she came and asked me if I needed help. Of course I needed help then she signed me in. All the other associates were busy helping customers. Once one was free I heard him go up to her and he told her “who’s next?”  And she said he’s next she pointed to me and said he just wants a quote. Then she pointed at the door where customer just came in and said that they are looking to buy contacts. The gentleman immediately went to the door and I was skipped. If you do go to this store say you’re going to BUY something so you can be helped before anyone else. All the woman asked was my name she didn’t even bother to ask what I was there for. I just immediately left after this. There’s plenty of other LensCrafters just go to another one.< /review>

My son was nervous about his first pair of glasses and Mark took care of him, talked about Mountain Bike riding (which my son loves), and really built up his confidence with the new glasses. Thank you so much for the outstanding customer service at such a busy time, Mark deserves a raise!!! Thank you!!!<//review>< username>

<Review>We arrived together husband and wife for eye exam and selection of glasses if needed. The staff followed Covid-19 sanitation and distancing guidelines at all times. They were friendly, helpful and directed us to the most affordable selections under our plan first. We were both very satisfied with our exam, selection options and follow-up offered.

Thank you,

Great experience. Eye doctor was superb.(no pressure,no upsales, explained everything. NO SUPRISE/HIDDEN COSTS. Purchased glasses also. Was not rushed or followed around. Huge selection from name brand(gucci, oakley, coach etc) to there own generic line. Once again no pressure to buy extras(warrenty, lens treatments) etc. Cost was in line with other eye doctors I have visited in the past. Plus if thry have the lenses in stock, thry can di them in an hour right in the store! Wife is going next week!</Review>

I’ve been going here for a little over a year now and I have to say that the service is beyond what I ever expected. I went in today because my current frame broke but I was so in love with the frame that I needed to have the same exact one. The gentleman went above and beyond to help me out and had me walking out with new frames within minutes. I recommended this place before and I will continue to do so. I was left without words with today’s service. Thank you Lens Crafters!<//Text>

My eye glasses broke, and they were my only pair. I really needed them for work and was stressed about getting a new replacement as soon as possible. Did a little research and found Lens Crafters accepted my insurance. Made an appointment and had a new pair of glasses with in two hours. Service was awesome, I would recommend them to any one!!!< /Text>

Had complete eye exam.  Was fasinated by the machine that takes a picture of the back of your eye.  Doctor was very thorough when explaining my results. I just wish thier was a faster turn around time on glasses that have to be sent out.< /Review>

Came here last year and again a few months ago. First time here, I was annoyed and would’ve given them a 1/5 stars because of the lack of customer service and knowledge. Few months ago I came back and experienced friendly customer service for the most part however the sales guy sounded like he’s talking out of his a** a bit. But at least he was nice. Not my first rodeo getting glasses and lots of what he says contradicts what I know about glasses. Ive been shopping around a lot lately since I moved from Colorado to California and I found an optometrist here but didn’t like their frame selection so I’ve been looking for an optician but it seems like California don’t have many of those out here. It stinks because it leaves me to resort to chain stores. It’s hard to find honest people who knows their stuff and I haven’t had much luck finding many people who don’t sound like salesmen. Overall my impression of the people were they’re nice but not really genuine. Knowledge was 1/5 but a typical person who knows nothing about glasses can get easily sold. If you’re buying just sunglasses with no prescription, I’d buy if I didn’t have to deal with the workers.</Text>

I really appreciate the Lenscafters at Roseville Galleria. They really wanted me to be happy with my glasses and took great care of me. Broad selection of glasses too - although not enough of the rectangular variety. Are those out of style now? Either way. It's five stars for Lenscrafter's Galleria!!< /Review>

<Review>Watch out! These people will try to charge you for things that even their own headquarters say should be covered by your insurance.

A few months ago we paid out the wazoo for my son's glasses and exam (just to avoid a big confrontation/scene) which should have been fully covered.

So, when it was time to get my exam, I checked with my insurance AND LensCrafters. Both told me I would be totally covered by insurance. When the lady at the front started my visit by charging for a fitting that was covered I walked out.

The Dr. is wonderful but definitely not worth dealing with the sheisters up front. For. Sure. Go to Stanton Optical and save yourself a screwing over.</Review>< Name>

<Text>First experience/visit was positive. Staff warm and friendly. Returned for a week check up and to order glasses. The dr appeared inattentive as did the staff. Most were too involved with having their own converowith each other. I was barely greeted, received absolutely inadequate assistance. I asked for a print out of all the glasses I had selected. The male that was helping printed one out and then proceeded to briefly hand write the other glasses out in detail so I could compare before spending a large amount of money.  I chose to walk out and will not order from this location. Disappointing experience. Displeased with the customer service at this location. Far too many other eye glass places worthy of my business.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I have been a Lenscrafters Customer for well over 15 years and this was the worst one I have ever been to. I walked in with my family, which are all Lenscrafters customers as well and we were going set an appt. for the following day to get 3 pairs of glasses which was easy over $1000.00 worth of business. This was 11/19/18 @ 7:30 PM and guess what , not even a greeting or hello or hey I will be with you in a bit. Very very unprofessional, I'll never bring business ever to this Lenscrafters.< /Review>

<rate>2<//rate><review>Unfortunately, they almost never seemed to be staffed with enough people.  I just called to check on whether my glasses were ready, and they couldn't even check -saying that there were 3 people ahead of me.  I also had a tough time getting any attention last night when I first walked in.  Just seems like it's a body shop - without enough staffing.  HIRE MORE PEOPLE!< /review>< Pictures>

<text>To start, I talk professionally. I'm not the type of customer who thinks I am always right. I am the type who talks to sellers in a nice way all the time to get a nice service as well. So I had a not so good experience here. I started to have blurred vision and just walked by this store and thought of having my eyes checked. I have never worn eyeglasses, my eyesight was perfect, so this blurred vision really bothered me. Initially, it was okay. Had the eye exam and then shopped for eyeglasses. It was ready after an hour. They have 30 days that you can return it or exchange it. After 2 days, I went back to have it changed because I felt the need for a different frame and style of lens. I got a new pair which was delivered after 7 days because I added the bluelight filter. After getting it, I tried it for another 2 days, had to go back because it was not so clear like the first one, and the staff figured out the focal point where the pupil should be aligned wasn't really aligned. That was the fault of the guy who took a picture of me wearing the frame for measurement because he told me to chin up when that really wasn't the way I look at things. But they fixed it, ok. They told me to try it for a week and I did, it felt okay. I didn't feel dizzy as the first time I wore it but I was confused as to how far can I really see clear coz there are some words or writings that I cannot see for a certain distance so I just went in after 2 weeks and tried to ask, and the staff scheduled me to have a prescription recheck for the next day. Went in there, and I saw those staffs who had helped me kept looking at me and yeah I was checked in, then the doctor came out and to my surprise with a feeling of annoyance. He explained about the eye, the cornea, the measurement of the inside of the eye, compared to the prescription. He said everything looked really perfect. I told him my reason, my confusion, to why I went there. But his voice was still loud that even the other customers where looking at me. I felt like they think I kept complaining and they're just tired of it when it's just the 2nd time I talked to the doctor and the other visits were about the glasses. It has to be right. Vision is very important. Most important of all the senses. I just wanted to see really good and I let him know that. But that last visit made me really disappointed. It was a wrong decision to step in there and voice out my concern. And to add, I did say thank you after. And he said, maybe get my eye exam again in 6 months and he walked away. I was with my husband thw whole time in there and he did think too that that doctor just walked out. Very rude.<//text>< Pictures>

<user_id>103518194171103609504</user_id><user_name>John Day</user_name><Review>Where do I start with this one? I originally came in to get a pair of sunglasses mid July 2015. I purchased frames from a site that I normally purchase my eyeglass frames from. So I brought them in and met with an Optician named Mark. I feel bad about writing this review because Mark and a couple other of the employees were very professional and polite. So before we got the lenses made I had to get an exam. Which was screwed up. See I where glasses and have been for a long time and have disease called kerataconus, so I have a extreme astigmatism. My prescription I felt was fine and didn't need to be changed. But they went ahead and did the exam, $90+ . It turned out that the prescription was wrong. So they had to remake the sunglasses and the eyeglasses. Back to my current prescription. Which I see perfectly out of, go figure. So long story short, I kept coming down(which is about an hour drive from where I live) to find out that they continued to screw my lenses up. I have a certain base curve on my current glasses that I've gotten used to, which were made at a Lens Crafters in the Arden Fair Mall about 2-3 years ago, so why was it so difficult to make the lenses that I had made at a LC store before? They kept saying that they told the lab techs to follow the order and match the base curve and they continued to screw them up. 5 TIMES! 5 TIMES after the initial 2 first appts I had to drive down just to find out that they screwed up the lenses again and had to have them remade. And to add insult to injury, I paid $54 extra the last time so that they could make the lenses in a thinner material!!!! And they still screwed it up. It's been almost 3 MONTHS since my first initial visit!!! I didn't even need to get a new pair of frames and lenses from them, my original prescription was right and all I wanted was a pair of sunglasses. And I still have no prescription sunglasses. I did get a call today from one of the managers and I am getting a refund but will have to drive down once again to give them the lenses out of my sunglasses frames they made to get that refund. Even though I cant see crap out of them. Horrible business, I would strongly suggest you go to your personal optometrist and go that route. This company is way overpriced and the way they pump customers in and out of there I really don't think they care.<//Review><rate>1< /rate></record></dataset><record>

<review>Let me start by saying that it is very hard for me to write reviews and give comments because sometimes you need to give people the benefit of the doubt. We came into this shop with a prescription for my 7 year old son who had eye surgery the previous day. His glasses needed a special lens for his condition. We got the lenses from LensCrafters a week and half later. I regret not checking with another shop if the lenses were right in the first place. It took us 6 weeks to find out in our Dr.'s office that the lenses were not well fabricated, they moved the prism to much to one side and that 1 hour human error cost my kid to have his left see in a different direction.
I do not recommend this shop, we did confront them and they agreed the lenses were not exactly the prescription we had given them and gave us a refund but now they have set us back.
In many cases I would give people the benefit of the doubt but not for something like this, they did not double check their work; again, I regret it myself to not check with another shop but I guess I had put to much trust in their name.<//review>< pics>

Something alotnof people dont know isnthe eye exam and lense crafters are TWO different business operating in oke store frontm kinda like starbucks inside of target. Ive been coming to this location for over TEN YEARS. Im so confused by the negitive reviews becasue its so far from every experience ive had in there it makes me wonder if these are people are on different planet or just difficult people to please anyhow. I got sunglasses there once that i had trouble with and after a uear of having them i took them in and they were like" oh gosh the lenses are installed wrong! Lets get them fixed asap im so so sorry." it was the end of the day everyone was tired and the lense cutter/installer came out personally to agian apologise for whom ever messed up and to personally check the new improved sunglasses he fixed. On top of that they gave me an extra 40$ off my new glasses i went in there for. Ive always experianced amazing customer service here. So much so i travel 1.5 hrs to go.< /review>

My boyfriend and I went in looking for an  eye exam and glasses.  After being in there about 15 min and not being greeted,  I approached the young lady at the front desk to ask her about an appointment,  she made me feel like I was bothering her. After speaking to her, we continued to shop for approximately 25 min, not one person acknowledged or greeted us the whole time. We have never purchased from Lenscrafters in  Roseville, only the one in Folsom and Arden Mall,  both experiences were  wonderful!  Everyone is always friendly and we get greeted right away.  So we were both a little suprised by the unprofessional service here at Lenscrafters in Roseville. So, we walked out and we went to the one in Folsom where  had the best service! Between my boyfriend and I, that's a $1400.00 LOST sale for your store, also.... we will never go back to the one in Roseville Mall  again or recommend it. Word of mouth is a very powerful tool in sales and the customer experience. Maybe a little customer service training could help? At least on how to greet customers... really that's all customers want is to be greeted and acknowledged in a friendly manner.<//review>

Gross! I stopped to get gas and clean my windows. The water smells like an old rag. They obviously do not change the water and clean their squeegees. It's a good thing I was wearing my gloves and mask. The smell wreaked and stuck to my car and now I have to get a complete car wash. Made me wanna barf! Ugh!<//text>

Charge for air, but can't give change with purchase to actually use it. Sure. Pumps look pretty sketchy to boot.< /text>

We have been using them for 5 years now and have never had a bad experience.  They take good care of my dog and he always looks great when they're done.  The staff are very knowledgeable.<//Review>

My dog Teddy has a history of past abuse and as such is extremely terrified of new people, places, smells and sounds. He never bites at the groomer but he does get extremely fearful and usually takes a few days to get back to his “normal” self. Well, Teddy did FANTASTIC at Soggy Paws. I’m just visiting the area from Texas but decided to take him here based on reviews and I am so glad I did. The groomer did a fantastic job cutting his hair to exactly the length I wanted, and when Teddy came home he was perfectly fine which I know was because of the groomers treatment of him. I highly recommend Soggy Paws</text>

<review>Won’t come back again!! They charged full amount of the service that didn’t finish it. Maybe my puppy nipped a little when he gets stressed however I warned them when I made an appointment they said they will be the best they can do. We had to go to another pet spa after that. They did good job with any problems..< /review>< Resp>
{'time': 1614126574737, 'text': 'Hi Maddie. Theo was very nervous and we took our time and worked with him but we were unable to do his anal glands and trim his back end down as well/as short as requested. So we did do our best with him even though he was a little nippy. Our Release Form that was signed at his first appointment does state that we do our best with difficult dogs and will charge for the work done which was a full body haircut. We did let the person know who picked up what we weren’t able to do and that we did our best and that he may be more comfortable at the next appointment since this was his first haircut.'}< /Resp>

<review>Jessica and her staff are always friendly and caring.  This is the only place we will bring our dog.  We have a new puppy and brought him in last week.  They do an amazing job and our dogs smell fresh for 1-2 weeks.  We've been to other grooming places and they don't come close to what Soggy Paws does.  I highly recommend this place!!!</review>< pictures>

<Text>Just had my first visit to Soggy Paws Pet Grooming for my three dogs, all with long hair. They were outstanding because they are very professional in terms of their requirements for all animals to have all their shots up-to-date, ,and their appointment setting process, and the way they treat everyone who walks through their door. My dogs came out beautiful and the prices are very reasonable. They are my new groomer for sure and I strongly recommend them.<//Text><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Shayna is our "go-to-gal-for-grooming".  Dior had a bit of a skin allergy and I had to tote along her medicated shampoo to our last grooming appointment. Shayna still had her done in under 3hrs looking cute and clean as always. Thank you for taking such loving care of my little girl.</review>

Great place to get your dog all his or her grooming needs met! Everytime I take my dog here he always comes home looking and smelling great and has a cute neckerchief on. Definitely take your dog here if you want quality grooming from a friendly staff with affordable prices. 4 stars easy!</Review>

Angela (Angie for short) is the by far the best groomer! I've followed her everywhere she went, except when she moved out of state.. So when she moved back, I didn't hesitate to take both my dogs to get groomed by her. She knows exactly what to do when I briefly explain to her what I like. :)< /review>

Our dogs have been going to Soggy Paws for several years and the team there is fantastic.  They were sympathetic when we had a geriatric dog, have been patient with our bundle of energy and love on our other pup while styling him so much that he practically jumps out of the car when we drive near the shop.  Highly recommend.</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>First time client, I decided to try Soggy Paws based on other online reviews. When I showed up to inquire, the staff was friendly and answered all my questions. I also like the fact the grooming area was visible and not "behind closed doors" so to speak. Booked an appointment for the following week, my dog was dropped off at the scheduled time and was ready about 3hrs later. I greatly appreciated how quickly they had my dog ready (13yr old toy poodle) since I will not return to places where she is there all day. I will definitely return when she needs her next haircut.<//text>< Pictures>

They did a great job on my little cocker spaniel.  Had to get grommed up from a big furr ball to a proper cocker cut for the holidays. Angie was his groomer and she was sweet to him.  He came back a happy dog!< /Text>

<text>::::::UPDATE:::::: 2yrs later and I’m still so happy that I choose Soggy Paws. My dog Mack continually looks amazing. I change up her grooming style depending on the time of year or for camping/beach outings. Pricing still beats all local areas. Once I really needed to wash her after a really messy muddy time at a park. Stopped off at the closest “wash your own dog” option and just out of curiosity I asked their pricing for a 30lb medium doodle. OMG!!!! 50-$75 more (I only pay $75) they were almost double compared to Soggy Paws. My mouth dropped. Same wash same everything for the spa/groom... but, one thing different is the cleanliness/shop decor and how the staff themselves are tidy and dressed professional at Soggy Paws was superior to this location. There’s no doubt in my mind that I chose a great location.
———————————————————————————
I love Soggy Paws!!!! I had such a high level of nerves behind my first visit. I’ve heard horror stories about dogs going in looking okay and coming out looking like a shaved rat. THAT’s NOT the case here!!!! My baby went in shaggy but, cute and CAME OUT STUNNING!!!!! They did everything I asked! She smelled like candy. She was happy and not scared. Only 17.5wkd old but, she’s 18lbs. (Australian Labradoodle). I already had my next appt set the second I got home. I sent my Mom with her extremely nervous 5yr old dog for a nail trim. She was in and out in 5min. No issues... unlike other places where her dog has bleed or is shaking. Nothing... she looked so happy and perfect. My mom was pleased. We recommended my SIL for her two dogs. I can’t say enough POSITIVE things. The place is  immaculate inside. Staff is beyond pleasant and walk you through exactly what your pup will experience, when you pick your pup up they explain how things went, and your pup is happy and socializing. Can’t wait for our next appt!!!!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<username>Darin Dohi< /username><Time>1532121344783<//Time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Based on a recommendation by a good friend John Ollum, we took our dogs in for grooming.  We have a Lab-Corgi mix and a Pomeranian.  We used to take them to our local Petsmart groomers but have been unhappy with how they came back to us the last few times.  The team at Soggy Paws were amazing from the time we stepped through the doors.  What was even more amazing was our doors acted like they owned the place and didn't show any nervousness or trembling.  Jake, the Labra-dorgi, came out clean as a whistle.  Clearly they must have furminated him as his coat was thinned considerably and smooth!!!!  Our Mini, the Pom, had to undergo a massive transformation as our failure to brush her resulted in mats in her undercoat that had to be cut out.  Even that was handled with care and the result was amazing.  Nails were trimmed, coats washed, mini with a cute summer do.  All is right with the world.  Thank you Soggy Paws.  We love you guys!</Review>< Pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I took my little chihuahua to get her nails trimmed this morning. I usually do it myself but I hate it cuz she always freaks out. They did a great job and she wasn't as freaked, maybe cuz it wasn't me. It was my first time at a pet groomer so it didn't occur to me that I should tip, so when I go back I'll make it up to them.< /text>< username>

< Review>
I just moved into the area and these folks were nearby. Took my Shih Tzu, who grows hair like a shadow grows in the evening. They did a great job of trimming her hair nice and short and still keeping her cute to melt my GF's heart. I thought I was going to a good place previously in my old town, but these folks do such a better job. Make sure you leave them a big tip!<//Review>

On the same set of messages left, one of my distributors pointed out my answering machine says holiday hours still! They were different from our normal Tues-Sat 8:30-6pm hours. I wasn't aware of this because I had recorded a new message, but clearly it didn't save and update. I will try calling again to see if I can get ahold of you, if not you can reach me directly at the shop and ask for Jessica. I will do my best to make this right."}< /Response>

Two crispy tacos.  Pretty much impossible to eat.  And pretty much the best two crispy tacos you'll ever eat.  This place makes Willits almost a destination town.  And that is saying something.  Sorry.  I love you Willits.< /text>

Stopped on the way back to the Bay Area for take out and it was excellent. Super fresh tasty salsas, fried tortilla chips, well seasoned meats, the real deal. Based on reviews I went with a torta and a crispy taco, would love to try a chile relleno next time.< /Text>

The portions are the best in town. If you have dietary restrictions or a special order, be very specific about what you want, they don’t mind accommodating your needs! This is the only Mexican restaurant I’ll eat at any more.<//text>

My husband and I were driving down the 101 for the first time and stopped at Taqueria Bravo because my last name is Bravo, lol. We didn’t know what to expect but thought we’d give it a shot and support a small business. We absolutely loved the food and the customer service was excellent !! The food was hot, fresh, authentic and simply delicious !!</review>

When the guy at the counter warned me that they were fried I was afraid it was going to be a frozen fish patty. It was fresh tasting and delicious.

The other meats are served like street tacos with a small tortilla with a big pile of meat. I would recommend.<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>The service was great and food (burritos) we're good. Their salsa is perhaps the best salsa I've ever had in a Mexican restaurant. It didn't seem traditional to me, but totally amazing.

About a dollar or so more than I would have thought.  But they had good food -- tried the super burrito -- and wonderfully spicy sauce options, too.  They also had a decent selection of beers (from US and Mexico).  I would swing back if I am ever in town again.<//Text>

Vet nice food and the purple and service are great. NOT Termed but very good authentic food. Only downside... No restrooms, but they'll direct you to some nearby toilets if need be. Take a break from 101 and combine this with a walk along the Willet high street.<//Text>

Surprised to find such delicious Mexican food in this city. Really popular for call in orders so even if the place looks empty you might have to wait a few minutes for your food. It is, however, worth the wait. Fresh, tasty and full of flavor.</review>

Was told they didn't have public restroom due to being sued by handicap person for not being ADA compliant.  Don't know how a restaurant cannot have restroom for customers.  Went somewhere else to eat and use their restroom.  So they lost a customer.

Excellent chile relleno burrito and salsa! More vegetarian options than other Mexican restaurants. The guy working the counter was really nice and helpful. I would have given 5 stars, but there's no public restroom.<//Review>

Loved this little hole in the wall! Unbelievable Al Pastor tacos, that are perfectly marinated and authentically made. I also really enjoyed the Torta with chicken. Definitely going to come back often, it's a go to mexican restaurant for a quick bite!</Text>

Well if I had to review it I'd say I wouldn't come here it tastes to good to share so GO AWAY!!!, Really you should listen to me especially during these trying times. The food will taste the same through social distancing and personal protection devices and that should drive everyone away.<//text>

Crispy tacos. Get one carne asada and one carnitas. Make sure you are sitting down and have access to a fork. It doesn't get much better. Seriously.< /text>

This place is a true gem in a town full of Mexican food restruants. They produce fresh street style food that never lacks whether on a cold December day with 1 customer or a out the door 4th of July. This should be on every passerby checklist 2.95 tacos 12.95 2 enchilada combo and 8.75 burritos.<//text>

Surprise! This was great. Food was on point. Well seasoned. Chimichanga was rolled with care and expertly fried. Crisp without being dry. Perfectly melty filling without burning you tongue. My wife requested a Taco Salad which was not on the menu. No problem. Tomatillo Salsa is excellent. Worth the visit. Friendly staff.<//review>

< Review>
Been going here for years!! Most people would think, a little hole in the wall..Our favorite mexican food in Mendocino County! So glad we stumbled across it so long ago..Try it !! You will not be  disappointed!! The carne asada is the best we have had, and we have tried a lot of mexican restaurants in Mendocino County! Not tough, no gristle, and excellent flavor, unlike so many others we have tried! And the green tomatillo sauce is to die for!! Get extras!! We do!! Everything is fresh and amazing!! Did I mention...the staff is very friendly to boot!! Btw, we got super burritos and pollo asada quesadilla...and very affordable in comparison to others!</Review>

Fantastic place to grab Mexican food. Still compare every other mexican spot with it everywhere we go. No one can even compete! Talked to people from around the world who agree, it's best in norcal. Awesome service, delicious carne asada, grilled chicken, al pastor... huge portions, low cost. It doesn't get any better taco rio bravo!< /text>

<resp>None</resp><Review>Excellent Mexican fare. Have eaten there many times. Atmosphere is very relaxed (don't dress up), seat yourself after ordering at the counter. Foods to try; Chile Relleno Super Burrito, Super Nachos (go for the carnitas, they are amazing!) Chile Verde... the list goes on. Muy autentico! If you are very nice Elena might give you freshly grilled chiles de arbol.< /Review></record>

I've been driving through Willits for over a decade. More and more this is place I stop. Not the cutest or a romantic stop, it's the food that draws me.

Their pork (Carnitas, al Pastor) is some of the best I've ever tasted and I eat a Lot of Mexican food. Can be busy at meal times, but they're quick and always pleasant. Mucho Gusto!< /review>

Every Staff that is working at Select Physical Therapy is wonderful. Mr. John Neverida, PT is a great man. He is polite, gentle, caring, considerate and professional. I want to say many thanks to him.

Select Physical Therapy in Glendora keeps clean. All the staffs look harmonious. I really had fun while receiving therapy.< /text>

Julya and her associates were caring, considerate, professional, patient, and made going to therapy something to look forward to rather than seeing it as something to be endured. I have been more than satisfied with the sessions and the results of the therapy treatments I received.< /Text>

The care and attention given at Select PT is head and shoulders  above  the rest.  Julya Goldberg took me and guided me through the process of rotator cuff rehab.  Always patient, she and her assistants were always concerned with my rehabilitation and progress, always pushing me forward.  Once I was back at work, John took over and I was in just as good hands, they know what they're doing.  I'm not sure what I would have done without the whole, wonderful staff at Select PT helping me with different things at different times, from the Nicole, Mel and Joanna helping me with appointments  and workers comp problems, to Wendy, Karina and Jen getting me setup for all my therapy sessions and everyone else who got my arm back, thank you all for you're dedication. You are all the greatest!!!</Text>

I have never experience this kind of treatment, as far at my teens years, while playing football. My mother would take me to a therapist, for muscle relaxation therapy.Patty has treated me with top service, and very good stretching pointers, to help me along the way. Thank God for Patty! She is great!</Review>

<text>I have been having severe pain in my right shoulder and arm for months now, and it has been impacting my quality of life. I was referred to Select Physical Therapy - Peachwood, where I met Julya Goldberg, PT and her team. I was immediately impressed with the care and compassion displayed towards me by everyone, as well as Julya's careful assessment of my problem and the necessary treatment plan. After just one session, I could tell a difference; I was able to sleep through the night! The therapy is not without discomfort, but it's obvious Julya knows what she's doing, she knows what will work best for my recovery, and she and her team are committed to helping me get back to a state of health. And again, I can't emphasize enough, especially in today's climate, the care, attention, and compassion displayed to me during each session by Julya and her team.<//text><response>{'time': 1610014966660, 'text': "We're happy to hear you're on the road to recovery.

This facility offers the healing treatment you require but, in addition, is offered  with an atmosphere of genuine care and concern.  Once a safe level of progress has been made, the given exercises are encouraged as life-style changes and promotes self-care.  The physical therapists were positive, focused and welcoming!<//Review>

I had a hip replacement and after 1 month I was ready to go. I highly recommend this facility for a rehabilitation center.

<review>I have been to several physical therapy locations and I have to say there is no comparison to this place(Select Physical Therapy). Everyone is so pleasant & they really show they care about you & your pain. They plan a routine that is best for you & work with you. It’s not a quick out the door place. The therapist & assistants are miraculous. I’m blessed to have been sent to this outstanding place.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c32632abf7e3bf:0x9b307ae169cfc1c0</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

My back pain has definitely improved thanks to the physical therapy at Select PT. I can continue with my daily routine without discomfort and I'm almost back at 100% thanks to the exercises and one to one help. I wouldn't go anywhere else but here!< /review>

<Text>Great Experience
I've been referred to many physical therapy organizations over the years and frankly most of them were a total waste of time.

Select Physical Therapy is a welcome exception to what I've experienced in the past. Their staff is friendly, efficient and works well as the team. The core of my physical therapy experience is Julya Spadaccini/Physical Therapist.  Julya is extremely knowledgeable in her craft as physical therapist. She excels at patient relations and pays attention to each of her patients concerns and special needs.</Text>< Pics>

< review>
If you're looking for a dealership to buy a Nissan, Nissan of San Juan Capistrano is definitely the way to go. This dealer is large enough to have what you need but small enough to be personable. I tried several other dealers, (Irvine & LA) and they're just too big. Takes the fun out of buying a car. Also, Marco was nice and extremely helpful. Appreciate this dealership alot!</review>

Recently leased a Nissan Leaf from Nissan of San Juan Capistrano after having a bad experience at a different dealership. I spoke with David over the phone and told him what I was looking for and how much I was willing to pay. He was able to get me the best price possible! When I showed up to the dealership David was with another customer but he quickly assigned Ashton to help me out. Ashton was amazing and answered all my questions. I definitely recommend this dealership. Ask for David or Ashton!</text>

Robin the sales girl listens to me she did not pressure me into purchasing a car I did not want she listened to what I wanted and found a 2 cars in my price range that would work good for me. Marcos the sales manager he went up and beyond to help me get financed. He listened and worked with me being I have no credit and just starting to reestablish my credit. Alex the financial guy got me the lowest interest possible with the hardest of circumstances. They have been nothing but helpful since getting my car. You want the ultimate car buying experience go and speak with them. They will treat you with the respect you deserve and truly listen to your wants and what you can afford.

Final Update:
I received a call from Nissan Corporate this morning, and unfortunately they will not be able to help, as they will take the dealer's side on this.  The issue is, the dealer is communicating my concern to them incorrectly.  And even when I tried to explain to Nissan Corporate, they will defer to what the dealership is saying.  Oh well.  I cannot recommend anyone shop here for anything.  These situations are probably only going to resolve themselves with class action litigation.  Just Beware!

Update:
I received a call from the dealership saying that the scratches were fixed, along with the dents. The area that was scratched does look repaired. That's great. Unfortunately, the dents that they claimed were fixed are mostly fixed, except for the largest and most obvious one to see. Needless to say, I will be contacting Nissan corporate tomorrow, and likely filing a complaint with the Bureau of Automotive Repairs. Nobody should endure this type of runaround when they purchase a new car. I have not had my van for more than half of the time I've owned it over the last 3 weeks. This is just unacceptable. With that said, everyone at the dealership has been very nice, including Liza and Evan. I'm not sure who "Nathan" is, that the manager mentioned in his response to my review here.

I would stay away from here at all costs. They say one thing to your face, but they don't respect you at all. We purchased a brand new 2019 NV Passenger from them on April 21st. We purchased the perma plate option, for paint and exterior protection as well, because it's always nice to have extra coverage. Fast forward to today, and I have had the car at the dealership since Monday, waiting for the "sales team" to decide what they want to do with a bunch of dings and a couple of deep (to the metal) scratches. I don't understand why my vehicle's fate is in the hands of sales people, but it is. I will be calling corporate promptly, but I want everyone to know that you better keep your guard up here. Do not accept any of their sales tactics as truth.

I will edit this review as things progress. Currently, we are being helped by their customer loyalty team, after contacting corporate to get involved in the process. I still cannot recommend this dealership at all right now.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzV7xEUFfMgAXRaFka-_aWVJ8-rqxcWjgpPv5H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYCwWL1Bgbn_q9CSTn4iqytitv72VQD_zi5VaD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Absolutely bar none...the worst experience I've ever had at any dealership! The salesman Matt's negative  energy about his previous employer adding extra charges at signing is exactly what was done to me by them. The got 2 stars instead of 1 because of the finance team effort and energy 👏👌🙌< /review>

But, this time I am very happy that I drove 52 miles from San Diego and came here to change my car.  The staff there were very polite, kind and helpful and helped me with a lot of patience and information and finally I was able to find the car I wanted and they also paid a good price for my car.

I have brought my Rogue to San Juan Capistrano Nissan for all my service.  My last visit was for oil and oil filter change. When I pulled up, Angel met me at my car and immediately started the check in process! After checking the mileage, Angel expedited the paper work and I only waited about 30 minutes! Angel is very courteous and professional! He made sure I was kept informed by visiting me in the waiting area.  Thank you Angel and thank you Nissan for taking good care of me and my cars over the past 9 years!< /Review>

John Harneth did a fantastic job.  The transaction was quick and easy, and he answered all of my questions.  I have already recommended him to a friend.  My Leaf SV is fantastic.  Cheap to pay for, but doesn't feel like a cheap car.  Goes really well for a base model and has a bunch of features that work really intuitively.<//text>

Brought my car for service and was in and out within an hour. Nice to see the same faces as when I bought my car. Angel the advisor was very pleasant and Tyler (my sales person) brought me coffee in the waiting room. Every employee that walked by me and others that were waiting said hello and asked if we need anything! New GM has turned this place around!!!
Highly recommend</Review>

Just had a great experience.  We leased a LEAF, and hammered out all the details through email.  Car was ready when promised.  We just went in, did a test drive, and filled out the necessary paperwork.  Quick and painless, as opposed to languishing at a dealership for hours dealing with price and other things.  Ashton really delivered for us.< /Review>

I had a wonderful experience at Nissan San Juan Capistrano. Angel, the salesman and Tyler the sales manager were both very helpful and clear about the Toyota Corolla and all the information that came with it. They were flexible and brought in their financial manager who was also very helpful. They listened to my needs and met them. I cannot express enough of my satisfaction at having bought my 2018 Toyota Corolla through this dealership. All parties brought excellent customer service and were even willing to perform a chase when I didnt have my checkbook with me.

Thank you for hiring such wonderful personnel.</Text>

I was very pleasantly surprised on how easy they made it to buy my new truck. I talked on the phone to Tyler and then MO and within 2 hours we had a deal, and I was able to pick up my truck today with no suprise,s or changed deals it was exactly what we discussed on the phone, I was in and out in about 2 hrs with exactly what I wanted. Call Tyler and Mo and you will not be disappointed. a fair an honest dealership Nissan of America actually recommended them to me. Great job guys, and thanks for your due diligence.</review>

< Review>
The experience I had here really can’t compare to any other dealership! I went to a Nissan dealership in Huntington Beach and they told me the deposit I would’ve needed to put down was x4 the amount that I ended up putting down at this dealership! They saved me from being completely scammed and were completely up front about everything which is so rare these days with sales guys at these places! I honestly can’t recommend enough - If you’re worried about getting a bad car because you don’t have credit (my situation) come to these guys they are the only ones who were about to get me a BRAND NEW 2020 car for great monthly payments!! I will definitely be going back when I’m ready to upgrade too!<//Review>

<Text>By far THE BEST car buying experience I have had!  What began as a casual browse online, I was contacted by Tyler Sherman’s team. After a few months contemplating, I reached back out. I explained my current situation - unsure of what I can qualify for as I have run into very difficult times. (As with so many during this pandemic) Tyler was reassuring, and invited me to come and view the inventory.
After having to reschedule our appointment due to work obligations, I finally made it to the lot.
Upon arrival I was greeted warmly. I was directed to Tyler and with a calm, confident greeting I expressed again my concerns and my needs. Without any hesitation he provided a tour of the cars that fit my criteria and brilliantly provided details, facts and information on each.
Took a drive in the prospective car I was looking at and once we returned, Tyler made me feel comfortable covering the next steps. Once the application was complete, the manager Ayden introduced himself, asked a few questions and went to work to qualify. As we waited, Tyler answered all of my questions with ease. I never once felt pressured, never felt the need deposit more than I felt comfortable to or agree to higher monthly terms.
Ayden returned with my approval and negotiated the terms effortlessly, assuring that I was completely satisfied with all of the terms-which I was!
Both Tyler and Ayden went above and beyond to make me not only content but absolutely thrilled about my decision to get into a great Nissan Rogue-a killer deal at that!
Thanks guys, I really appreciate it and will return along with referring anyone looking to purchase without the cliche “sales-y” experience.

<Review>An automatic five star review for Nissan of San Juan Capistrano. Thank you to my salesman Juan Torres for your kindness and undivided attention to my car buying experience. Juan answered all my questions in a very honest manner, he worked closely with Jon in finance to help me get my payments that worked within my budget. And a big shout-out to Jon in finance, even after it was all said and done and I had left the dealership Jon contacted me the next day and was able to reduce my payments.Jon contacted me again 2 days later and was still continuing to work on my loan and was able to reduce my payments even more and also reduce the length of my loan. Never ever have I been to a dealership that once I left they continued to work tirelessly on my loan to reduce payments and make life just a little bit easier during these uncertain times.

I inquired about a used Nissan Titan Pro-4X the have on their website for the price of $37,690.  I started to negotiate price and they said that with the dealer add ons that they could not work with price on it.  They gave me a list of the add ons, I told them to remove them, they then proceeded to tell me that the advertised price does not include the dealer add ons.  They have a disclaimer on their site that the dealer can add those add ons and to them this seems fine.  To me it's a shady way of doing business, the advertise the truck for a certain price and when you arrive they give you a higher price.  They need to be upfront and list those add ons with the price they are looking to get out of it.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I had a great experience visiting this dealership, and being helped by David F. and Ayden. I came to look at the new 2020 GT-R. I didn't end up buying the car during my visit, because I wasn't ready, but they really gave me a great experience while I was there. When I first arrived, I went to use the restroom. When I came out, David had opened up the doors, hood, trunk etc. of the car and it looked stunning when I walked out. I felt at ease here, and didn't feel pressured. Thanks so much David and Ayden!<//review>

<Review>I have been paying a $12.00 ‘rider’ insurance police on my Nissan finance. It covered little things like cracked rims and lost keys.

8 months ago, I lost one of my two keys and finally went in to replace it. Although the service tech was pleasant and verbally helpful, he had to contact the claims dept. Because it was a Saturday, he could not contact them until Monday. That was a week ago. He still has not contacted me.

He did find me in the computer files. He has my address, cell phone number (and email address, I believe).

I’m planning to call him early next week with a follow-through call. If I can’t get a new key, I will cancel this rider policy. $12 per month is $144 per year and $720 total before the car is paid off!< /Review>< pictures>

The service department is amazing! Honest, friendly, and professional every time I get my vehicle serviced at Nissan of San Juan Capistrano. Gary, Tim, and Jeffrey thoroughly inspected my vehicle and provided the necessary services to prepare me for a cross-country trip. Gary always takes great care of my vehicle; he personally checks on the service progress and gives me updates. I know I'm in great hands at Nissan of San Juan Capistrano because of Gary and the service department team!  Thanks, guys, and I'll see you next time!!</review>

My fiancé and I met with Lana yesterday. Automatic 5-stars for her walking up to me to firmly shake my hand! We've been to a few dealerships and most times, they've blatantly ignored me...leaving me to be the one to introduce myself and shake their hand. 🙄
She was very informative and honest.
Lana and Marcos gave us some numbers without playing any games. I do hope we'll be doing business. In the meantime, I wanted to share my experience there. Wonderful customer service!< /review>

Marcos gave the best customer service I’ve ever experienced when getting a car. He gave the exact info I needed and asked for, and had everything ready for when I came into the dealership. All I had to do was sign and was on my way!  He was with another customer when I got there and apologized and said he would be ten minutes, he was back in less than five. An overall great and painless experience!< /text>

<text>So much more than just good service. I was made to feel like the most important person to walk in the door.  Warm greetings, WiFi,  car washed with oil change and beverages and snacks while you wait.  My agent let me know status of my car and came for me when it was ready.  It’s funny. I’ve never enjoyed getting my car fixed but at Nissan San Juan Capistrano I do.<//text>< pictures>

The dealership is top notch! We parked our car and were immediately greeted with a warm and pleasant greeting, as African Americans take note this is where we decide if this is sincere or one of those smiles we get only to get our money later to discover their klan members!
I assure my bros this place is legit and WARM !!! SPEND THE MONEY HERE!!!!! The car purchase process was done with the intent to save save as a Veteran they found us a better interest rate lowering our payments!
This place bought tears to this old Marine! This is how it’s suppose to be!!!!

One of the worst experiences I’ve ever come across not only for a car dealership but customer service prospective as well. Head sales manager attempted to hit on my partner, sold us a car which in return would have received 40,000 dollars worth of interest. Rude throw out the entire process. Just a horrible experience all around. I wouldn’t recommend this location if it was the last place to buy a car.</review>

< Review>
Our experience with Nissan of San Juan has been nothing but great. From Brian Escobar in service to the mechanics to mention a few Mario & Q are always very professional.  Our prior experience with other Nissan Dealerships (Nissan of Costa Mesa) horrible, service dept not willing to help and always trying to sell unnecessary services. That is what drove us to Nissan of San Juan, excellent customer service and they don't try to sell unnecessary services.  I highly recommend Nissan of San Juan.<//Review>

< review>
I am very happy to now have a reliable, honest Nissan dealership near my home.  When I purchased my Juke, I did so from the Carson dealership which is over 50 mi away...but they promised me a good deal and delivered the best service I've ever had for a car.  I originally went to the dealership in San Juan in 2014 (they were under a different ownership at that time).  I was disappointed in their high pressure salesmen, and they actually were crooked and tryed to 'take me to the cleaners'.  My experience at Carson was a pleasant and above average experience.  I feel that way about the personnel at San Juan now, and am so happy to be able to have my car serviced close to home now.  Thank you!<//review>

This was my first service with Nissan of San Juan Capistrano. Everything was perfect Brian, my service writer was easy to work with & gave me clear expectations. He called as promised when the car was ready. Props to your wash bay staff, my car looked great when I picked it up!

Thanks again for an easy and comfortable experience!!< /review>

<Text>The sales staff at San Juan Capistrano Nissan made car shopping an easy and hassle free experience. They didn't try to sell me a vehicle that I couldn't afford and in the end there were no unexpected dealership fees or charges. I simply told them what I had room for in my budget, and they were able to find a car and a financing option that worked for me. Thanks guys.<//Text><GmapID>0x80dcf1a519707de1:0xda7aabd62323ec94</GmapID></record>

Easy to schedule maintenance and service with their user friendly online experience. Had a scheduled appointment and was assigned a random service rep., as it was my first time there, but instead of making me wait (he was tied up with another customer), Matt Barr walked up and offered to assist me so I did not have to wait. So far the experience is good...ask for Matt Barr in service,  if that dept. is what you need.< /Text>

<review>We went there this morning to buy a Honda Civic EX 2006. The manager named Karl and Kacey were so nice to us. And we finally closed the deal with a very decent car. The car itself is still very well maintained. It was cleaned up again both the exterior and the interior. Then the porter actually drove us back home as an additional service since we hadn't bought a car insurance. Overall, this is a very recommended car dealer.. Although we didn't actually buy a Nissan. :P<//review>< Resp>

< review>
It’s not how a business treats you when you buy, but when you don’t buy. When a company helps to empower your decision and then respects that decision it addresses something missing from so many dealers, integrity. It’s easy to build a culture of immediate gratification, but the real value of a business isn’t the $$ they make on a deal but the loyalty they build. I don’t know what my next car purchase will be, but I will 100% visit Nissan of San Juan to start that search.</review>

<text>The service department and Gary is the best there is. I literally go out of my way for their service department here because I prefer to not go anywhere else. My X-Terra is almost 11 years old, and is running perfectly thanks to this service department.  Highly recommend this place, I will continue to be a loyal customer and will still never go anywhere else. Thanks a million guys for making my life easy, and car running perfectly.< /text>< Rating>

This is the most professional dealership I have ever dealt with hands down. I drove all the way from Los Angeles just to get my car from Nissan of San Juan Capistrano. I have heard such great things about this dealership, and it definitely surpassed my expectations< /review>

The service department at San Juan Capistrano Nissan is phenomenal! They have been keeping our daughter's Altima running the past 8 years in excellent condition. With it having over 100K and driving it back and forth from LA, we have it in for inspection regularly.  The service department keeps it safe for our daughter and giving us peace of mind.<//Review>

Level of service has declined since the change in ownership - came in for their oil change special when I asked for it the service tech said he was not familiars with the specials I showed him the website and said I had to have it printed - not indicated on their page asked about their free check engine light scan and said that was not to identify what if there is any issues - quiet a joke I only drive from Anaheim since this is where I got my car but last time I drive all the way done here for poor service and to be talked to in a condensing manner. He offered a free was but made it all point to tell me it would take another hour just for the wash, I passed.<//text>

<userid>112239287558870585336< /userid><Name>Christiaan Sorensen</Name><Review>I do not know where to start.  I came in with my truck having a loud knock/clank in the undercarriage.  A friend mentioned it might be the passenger front axle.  Dealership looked at it, couldn't find the actual issue, replaced the axle anyway (after asking me if that's what I wanted them to do; I didn't know the true cause until later).

I had a friend come take a ride with me, and after 5 min, we diagnosed the issue to be the rear differential.  Gears are completely ground down.

How on earth did someone at the dealership drive this vehicle and not notice is beyond me; there were 25mi on the trip odometer when we opened up the diff cover and discovered the damaged gears.  These gears were beyond repair and were DEFINITELY that way when the truck was in the dealerships hands.

I may never take my truck to Nissan of SJC again.  I cannot be any more disappointed, and I wish there was something more I could do than just post this review.

One star because I cannot leave zero.< /Review></record>

I was told the car I wanted was already installed theft recovery, protection package and dealer warranty, etc. and these items cannot be removed. Okay, very good negotiator.

The funny thing is I got the exact same car(yes, same VIN) from another Nissan dealer who transfer this car from Nissan of San Juan Capistrano with 11k less out-the-door price, without those fancy options.

My lesson: Do your homework and ready to walk out.<//text>

Weseloh Nissan was a great experience.  My family was considering a 3rd car as we were going to have a new driver soon.  We drove to the lot and were greeted with a friendly atmosphere, not a pushy over the top sales force like we had experienced with other dealerships in the past.  Within two hours we had test driven a vehicle, looked at several different options, sat down to see what our numbers for a possible purchase might be and completed the purchase of our new vehicle.  We had never had a car deal go smoothly.  We can not thank Weseloh enough for the professionalism and service we have received.<//text>

So totally unhappy that I would have to wait 2 1/2 hrs. to get JUST an oil change!!!! This is the second time, 1st time it was 1hr. 50 min. Do not understand what the hold up was. Gary was very nice and apologized but I WILL NOT return to your service dept. again. You need to fix the amount of time your customers spend there, SO SLOW!!!<//text>

Gary Linendoll is one of the many reasons why I always return to Weseloh Nissan.  He is extremely attentive and friendly.  His assessment of the needed repair or service have always been right on.  Unlike other garages, Gary never tries to push for any unnecessary services.  I appreciate his honesty and professionalism.   Oh yes, the waiting area is very nice and helps making time pass especially during some of the longer waits.</Review>

I have been in the auto industry for over 30 years. My family and friends usually call me to assist them when going to a dealership for a new car. My wife researched a deal for a CPR car and chose a vehicle with Nissan of San Juan Capistrano. Her sales agent was Lana Fallah (please forgive the incorrect spelling).  She gave my wife trade in value numbers and what they would offer her on the 2018 Nissan Rouge. I meet my wife at the dealership, reviewed the paperwork, and was pleasantly surprised. The numbers were clean. The offer was great. The vehicle condition and financing were perfect. I didn't have to haggle to beat the price down on the front end. Above that, Lana was great. She was straight forward, professional, caring, and respectful. So much so that I told the sales manager that my next Nissan would come from his dealership. When we got to the finance manager, Ali Fallah he didn't try to upsell to bring the price up. He showed my wife what he believed was necessary and what she was getting. There were no games, no ploys, and no tactics. Excellent service, great information Ali explained everything. This experience is how sales should be conducted and how consumers should feel. Thank you Lana & Ali Fallah. Thank you Nissan of San Juan Capistrano.< /text>

Rob at Weseloh was great in helping me get my leaf. He really was very helpful in answering all my questions over the phone and in email before I even came into the dealership. Once I was there, he again answered all my questions and was very honest about things he didnt know but got the right people to answer those questions. Truly a great buying experience from him and the rest of the staff at Weseloh. I even traded in my car and got a good deal for it. Would highly recommend him and the dealership for any purchase.< /Text>

< Review>
Beware beware beware when you sign your car contract with them: They charged us (my mother and I) $995.00 for GAP insurance, they also told us that our credit union wouldn't go over 60 month payments on our new car. (That was a lie). We refinanced right away with our credit union, they charge $299. For GAP. I'm not sure what the average cost is for GAP but to charge that much more is a rip off to me. Now let's add more proof of WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO GET RIPPED OFF AT NISSAN. DAMIEN their finance manager and Jonathan (their former sales manager) were in it together and illegally changed our contact. I actually have both contracts to prove the fraud. They are crooks and should be audited.< /Review>

{'time': 1541726378214, 'text': 'Sandra we wanted to let you know that we hear you and wanted to explain that GAP insurance can vary depending on who is offering it. We go through a different company that charges different fees and has different requirements. Your personal relationship with the credit union and the history doing business with them puts you in a special place. That special place most individuals would not get including longer financing time tables and lower costs for insurance through their brokers. We hope that this explains in a bit more detail what our staff was trying to convey to you during your visit.'}<//Resp>

I drove 1-1/2 hours from San Diego, only to be shocked that the price they promised on the phone and written via email was a total disinformation. The sales lady on the phone sounded polite and courteous and she confirmed both via phone and in writing that their advertised price was valid  for my case and I specifically asked if there were any hidden charges and surprises, and she strongly advised no. But when I got there, they just said she was wrong.<//text>

My daughter was searching for her very first car and what a beautiful car we found at Weseloh Nissan with the help of the greatest sales associate I have ever met, "Washington". His attitude and appreciation for assisting us was wonderful along with his thourough knowledge of the cars. The moment we walked into the dealership until we drove off with my daughter's car we received nothing but friendly,professional and timely assistance.  Thank you "Washington' for your superb service and when we need another car you and Weseloh Nissan will be our first choice ll!!!<//text>

< Review>
To be honest and not try to diagnose a problem without checking first... btw the dealer respond back to this comment saying this “We have to trouble shoot first in order to give a customer all the information they need to decide if they want us to continue on the repair. Depending on the issue with the vehicle if we did not fully trouble shoot and you drove away with the issue it could cause more damage. ”.  but sorry to still complaining but actually you guys didn’t do this at this first time they let me go without giving me a solution, saying I’m
Going to check this lady and you can go home and we will notify you, I have to ask before they checked me out what was wrong and they have to go and ask the mechanic... so pls stop responding because I have prove that you guys didn’t do a good job.... so they said I’m contradicting myself haha so that o why the dealer contacted me and apologize for not doing a good job you probably contradicting yourself for not having all the problem documented in... Nissan of Tustin did a better job diagnosis and fixed my problem.< /Review>

<user>107063065952356803605</user><username>Kevin Buck</username><Time>1448465402696<//Time><rate>3</rate><text>Readers, I'm not sure how to rate this dealership yet, but I will update this and other social network reviews as time progresses. The experience my wife and I had 2 weeks ago in leasing a 2015 Nissan Rogue at Imperio Nissan was great. The salesman (Roy Sudip) and his boss were both friendly and helpful in working out a deal, and we love the car so far. The problem I have is with the cash back involved. The deal called for Imperio to send me a check for $1,000 as part of my trade-in, and to date that has just not happened. I have sent e-mails to Mr. Sudip twice on this matter. He responded on the first, but is no longer responding to my inquiries, leading me to believe I may have to take other actions.

As I said, I will update this as time progresses, and let everyone know the outcome. If this becomes a legal problem (hopefully not, but I'm losing hope), I certainly wouldn't want other customers to have this problem. To be fair, if Imperio resolves the problem, I will certainly revise all social media posts to reflect that and an improved rating. BTW, I have the promise of this payment in writing from Imperio; I'm not making this up.

Sincerely, Dr. Kevin Buck<//text>< Pictures>

Worst car buying experience I’ve ever had. I purchased a vehicle and it took them over 2 months to register the vehicle in my name as well complete and submit all paperwork for the car. Every time I called I either didn’t get an answer or they just didn’t give me the information I needed and left me wondering when I was going to get what I needed. 3 months later I got what I needed. Not good business. Totally unacceptable. The manager was pretty pushy as well. This is only my experience however I wouldn’t be surprised if it happened in the future.</Text>

If I could give a Zero, I would. I was treated like dirt. Showed up for an appointment and Ariana easy even there. So, I talked with the 4th person to help me. I was home and he said he would call me back after he checked on prices. Not only did he never call me back, but the next day A friend of mine who worked for Nissan called to find out what was happening and he was told about the customer relations person that she would look into it and give me a call. She never called me back either and when my friend called she said she passed it on to someone else and I should be receiving a call. 2 Days Later I did get a call asking me what my decision was and when was I coming back to choose a car. I went to Nissan in Tustin California, and they rolled out the red carpet for me they do nothing about my horrible experience with Capo dealership, and they were the kindest nicest most thorough people I've ever worked with. I didn't have time to go over my car when I pick it up so one of the salesman called me to ask when I wanted to come in to learn about all the features. they reached out to me and didn't have to. When I brought it in I was helping mediately even though it was a Saturday they were swamped. I'd only had the car for 3 days and they even rewashed it for me if you want great service and a great car, go to Nissan in Tustin and avoid Nissan Capistrano like the plague!< /Text>

I got totally taken to the cleaners by this auto dealer.  Our lease was up on a  2013 Nissan Altima and we brought it into Nissan San Juan Capistrano.  We decided we wanted to buy it.  If I hadn't wanted the car so much I wouldn't have paid the price but they kept telling me it was the lowest they could go.  Now a few months later I have to sell the car and I will loose $2500 on the price I can get for the car now compared to what I had to pay for it.  Steer clear of this auto dealer!!<//Review>

<Review>Do not purchase a vehicle here. Customer service is horrible. Sales Manager Jonathan Kyle is extremely unprofessional. The fact that he told me his salss member was fired is mortifying. Even after speaking with GM AK, their sales managers attitudes and unprofessionalism conitnues. Word of mouth goes a long way and i deal woth a lot of people on a daily basis. Its unfortunate for Nissan.<//Review><Resp>{'time': 1541349816365, 'text': 'Stephanie Siqueiros we addressed your feedback on your last review.

If I could give a Zero, I would. I was treated like dirt. Showed up for an appointment and Ariana easy even there. So, I talked with the 4th person to help me. I was home and he said he would call me back after he checked on prices. Not only did he never call me back, but the next day A friend of mine who worked for Nissan called to find out what was happening and he was told about the customer relations person that she would look into it and give me a call. She never called me back either and when my friend called she said she passed it on to someone else and I should be receiving a call. 2 Days Later I did get a call asking me what my decision was and when was I coming back to choose a car. I went to Nissan in Tustin California, and they rolled out the red carpet for me they do nothing about my horrible experience with Capo dealership, and they were the kindest nicest most thorough people I've ever worked with. I didn't have time to go over my car when I pick it up so one of the salesman called me to ask when I wanted to come in to learn about all the features. they reached out to me and didn't have to. When I brought it in I was helping mediately even though it was a Saturday they were swamped. I'd only had the car for 3 days and they even rewashed it for me if you want great service and a great car, go to Nissan in Tustin and avoid Nissan Capistrano like the plague!</text>

GO ELSEWHERE....There are several other Nissan dealerships just north of this poorly run / ethically challenged franchise!

5/7/18
I inquired into leasing for credit challenged customers online.  I was bombarded by calls from Nissan of SJC to come in as they specialize in that type of auto transaction.  I was pleased when they approved me and provided a lease contract to drive the car off the lot. The rate was very high, but I know my credit justifies paying a premium.

5/14/18
Here’s where the lack of experience and hard selling kicks in. I received a call a week after I took possession of the vehicle telling me that Nissan declined my application (I’m not in the “misleading my car purchaser” business) but I do know that responsible/ethical finance managers provide their lenders a complete application with support for a final approval before they execute a binding contract and send their customer off the lot. NOT THE CASE!  I listened to the bad news and was told they had alternative financing lined up. I was told that they have an approval with worse terms, but it was a done deal. Having spent 20 years in finance, I learned that resolving a problem was more productive than focusing on who caused the problem. I agreed to the terms and quickly drove back to the dealership to sign the new contract. Upon reviewing the contract, I realized the rate was 2% higher than I was quoted an hour earlier when they broke the bad news. I realized this outfit was no less crooked than the slimy car salesman up and down Harbor Blvd.  knowing I was had, I signed the new “binding” contract and vowed to do more research next time!  Sit tight....it get’s worse!

6/12/18
I received a call that I needed a co-signer. I laughed a bit as it was a month after they bait and switched me into the higher rate loan.  I listened to their explanation and offered to provide a larger down payment. It was a Sunday and I was told they may not have a solution until Monday. Several days passed and I received a call asking for a co-signer again.  That said...I don’t think my offer to increase the down payment was considered or noted in their system?  For the 3 weeks after I signed the 2nd contract, I received multiple declination letters in the mail from banks. I didn’t think much about it because I had finalized the car purchase. Although they were submitting my application to a plethora of banks, they never asked for my approval to run my credit over and over, nor the fact that this deal was not finalized. My credit scores plummeted and I received notification from one of my current credit card companies that my account with them was terminated due to the decline in my credit scores (I wouldn’t have known of the massive inquiries had it not been for my creditor calling me to tell me my credit line was closed).

PLEASE know this is the culture at Nissan of SJC. Review your contract, look for misrepresentations and don’t be afraid to walk from the deal. There are many other Nissan dealerships close by......I can’t imagine they all conduct business this irresponsibly!< /review>

I cannot believe this place. I called ahead to ask about getting two recalls on my car fixed, they searched my VIN and told me what the recalls were and that I could come in at any time to get it fixed. I showed up the next day on Friday and after 3 hours, they tell me I have to come back to get one recall fixed. They already ordered a special part and it will be there by Tuesday. I waited until Thursday for a phone call, didnt get one, so I called them. No one would answer on the service team so I kept being rerouted to a receptionist asking where she could transfer my call. Then. I found a direct number, called them, and they said the part was on back order and they might have it in on Monday. Then sounded irritated when he said "We will call you, don't worry about calling us". So, they call me that following Tuesday, they say it is ready, I show up Wednesday and they fix the recall. They hand me a receipt and I say "do i just show this to the dmv, then?" They said "YES". I go to the dmv to renew my registration and get told I need an orange slip, all dealerships know that, so now I am playing phone tag again and no one is answering. I am in Oceanside, 45 minutes, away and all I want to know is if they can email or fax it instead of me going to them a 3rd time.. This is the worst service I have ever received and I am beyond annoyed with them.<//review>

I would not recommend purchasing a vehicle here. Once they make the sale the customer service in the sales department is nonexistent. They pass you around from person to person and can never give you a straight answer. They never call back when they say they will. This is the worst place to purchase a vehicle.<//text>

<date>1353305201846< /date><text>I come to Weseloh Nissan to get my 2011 Juke serviced. For this particular visit, I dropped in to get a part number. Someone hit my car and took off; fortunately, all that was done was that the fender flare had been torn off. My son works in the industry, so he was going to order the part through his work and put it on my car.

I usually deal with Dustin, Sabina and Gary Linendoll. Gary was gone that day, but John Arnold was very friendly and helpful, as well as Dustin and Sabina. As it turned out, Weseloh had the part in stock! I got my son on the phone, figured how much he could get the part for, and decided to get it at Weseloh for convenience sake. The tech assigned to the job even put it on for free! Everyone from Parts to Service could not have been more friendly or helpful with my need.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Buyers beware....if you have your own pre-approved financing for a lease buyout, don't go here! They will give you the runaround for a week, and give false purchase payoff information directly to your lender, then receive the check via FedEx, take the check to another dealership they manage (Irvine), and you will have to track it down because they didn't disclose, and will refuse to disclose all applicable taxes, title / registration costs, purchase option fees, etc.  in order for you to complete the vehicle purchase and take ownership of the leased vehicle. In their actions (which they will later justify when you complain), they will sit on your lender's check that they received from your lender, allowing you to incur finance charges, loan closing costs, etc., and there is no accountability for their sales persons mistakes. My husband actually had to go in person to get the check back from the dealership, and was then told upon arrival that the GM was in possession of the check at the Nissan of Irvine location (which he also manages). This was after the GM already knew of the escalated issue after being notified directly by Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp and me personally....

This dealership pushes the purchase option contracts, so that they can use their dealership financing (which they won't fully explain to you why because they think you don't know what they are doing). They did this with me multiple times in one day, and then on later days, even after I told them I just needed the dollar amount they needed for the purchase because I had my own financing. They think with this option, that since you have the 10 day window to then get them the payment for the vehicle, it shouldn't be an issue. When in reality, it's an extra step and unnecessary when you can just get them a check, in the amount that they need from your lender that same day so that you facilitate the purchase. The GM will tell you that you need to provide your social security number for identity purposes to complete the purchase, even if you have the payment in hand. After this incident, I checked with the DMV on the title and registration process along with Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp, and there is no need for you to provide your social security number to facilitate the purchase when you have your own financing….

The whole situation was very odd and a complete waste of my time that I can never get back. Save yourself the headaches and stress and go somewhere that is fair and honest, and provides full disclosures for such a large purchase. A dealership that doesn’t discriminate when you have your own financing, or intentionally make the purchase process difficult because they are making no profit in the lease buyout transaction. Sales managers that can talk and treat you with respect, and not refuse to calculate additional purchase costs to complete the transaction at hand. A dealership with a GM that actually helps to resolve the escalated issue, with a definite solution and immediate course of action when an issue escalates to his level and when there have been so many negligent actions by his management and sales staff during your transaction request. My requested lease buyout transaction should have been very straight forward, but they over complicated it to the maximum extent, and I lost money in the process. After multiple trips, I'm just thankful we were able to get the check back from them....

In reading further reviews and doing additional research on this dealership, I see that this is not the first time there has been an issue with them placing road blocks for this type of lease buyout transaction. This dealership is under new ownership and name, with the DBA being filed in March 2017. What happened here is not okay and has been escalated to the highest level with multiple reporting bureau’s to prevent anyone else from going through this.</Text>< Pics>

<text>I had the pleasure of purchasing a used vehicle from Rob Chianese at Weseloh Nissan.  I had two recent experiences with dealers that were so discouraging I nearly gave up on finding a new vehicle.  Then I called Rob.  He was not only respectful of my budget, but of my time.  He never tried to push me beyond my means and had everything ready for me when I arrived at the dealership.  I loved the car and was out of there in 2 hours and actually enjoyed my visit.  Thank you Rob and your management for making this experience so positive and reminding me that not all car salesman are out to dupe you.  I highly recommend the Weseloh group and Rob Chianese.  Very professional, thorough and respectful.< /text><Date>1356061653670< /Date><Resp>None</Resp>< pictures>

<Review>Just bought 2018 nissan rogue SV (feb 26 2018). But when i went home just got the car the same day i noticed the other key fob doesn't working. I sent email or send message on the contact web but no answer. I called them they put me on hold then they hang up the call. I called again they said they will notify jake and jake should call me (thats what they said). But i didn't get any call back. I called my sales broker because i made my deal with them (car specs). They said i can change the battery by my self. I did that but still the key fob didn't work after i put new battery. To many hassel for brand new car. This is Nightmare for me. And worst experience.< /Review><Date>1519861666690< /Date><user_id>114637212654404287048< /user_id><GmapID>0x80dcf1a519707de1:0xda7aabd62323ec94</GmapID>< response>

Great experience.  There was only one red stick shift Xterra within 75 miles when I was ready to buy, but when I showed up I still got a very fair price without haggling.  The finance process was clean and no hassle (especially compared to other experiences where I've had to walk out) and I managed to leave with a good deal on my car in 2 hours start to finish.

I normally think people that only take 2 hours to buy a car are getting ripped off (my last purchase took 2 weeks and 8 dealer visits to get my price), but they proved me wrong.  I did my research before I went and they came in just $300 (1%) over my target price right away (more than 10% lower than sticker).  I chose not to haggle for the extra price, but it's always nice to know that we're starting from a very reasonable number from the beginning.

I highly recommend the fair and friendly buying process at Weseloh Nissan!< /Review>

They damaged our cargo van
We sent our company cargo van Nissan NV
To Nissan of San Juan Capistrano 33633 CaminoCapistrano, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 On August 12th 2017 around
9:30am To fix a suspension manufacture defect , Brian from Service department called me around 4:30 to inform me that the service is done but there is an accident happened to my Van I went back to pick up my company Van and Brian and his manager Hernandez showed me a strong damage to the side of my van , and they explained that the service mechanic was testing my van and he hit my van to the wall and damaged the driver back side of the van , Brian and his manager offered me to fix the damage but they have to take the company van for about 9 business days to be fixed
> They offered me an open  truck or small van during the period of fixing my van but we are a heating and air conditioning company,so the rental van has to be same size as our van
I took our van to a three different collision centers for an estimate price to fix my van is
$5000 and it will take 15 business day to fix plus the company logo will cost $1400 plus the resale depreciation value of the van
plus renting a cargo van for three weeks $1500 I talked to Hernandez the service manager about His options to us , he said his collision center will take 9 business days to fix the van and they will charge him $300 to fix everything on the van , and Hernandz is willing to pay me $300. It is ridiculous that big of a difference
between his cost to fix and the other body shop cost.
> How can I trust Imperio Nissan to fix my van for $300
My van is 2014 cargo van has 32000 miles since day one the van has a lot of manufacture Defects, starts with the back up camera was defected also
> the van battery was defected and the front suspension was defected,also the  USB is defected and they can't fix it until now
I'm taking them to the court ,

Nissan of San Juan Capistrano are giving the wrong information, the accident happened under their new management , I have all paper work to prove that , we are in the court anyway
Don’t trust this Nissan dealer,</Text>

Paul and Miriam: extraordinary buying experience. I've bought cars from dealers before, but this, by far, is the best one. Rob Chianese went out of his way and helped me choose and buy a 2011 Murano on his day off. I highly recommend Weseloh Nissan and Rob Chianese!!! Thank you Rob so much :)<//Text>

<text>Everything is great up to the point when your vehicle needs service and that's where the "fun" starts at least for my experience. I purchased 3 new vehicles from this location and for my last Nissan Murano the CVT transmission started to show failures, I took the car to the service while in the manufacturer warranty and they told me nothing was wrong with it or at least they can't read anything (after charging me for the computer reading etc..). After another 500 miles I took the car back for another review as the problem was getting worse and then of course this time they found the problem and then just to be told that I'm out of warranty now being at 61000 miles and there is nothing they can do about it. This after I've being a loyal customer and servicing my car at their location.

(Update 09/09/2016)
My experience gets even better as I took my car to a local mechanic who found a problem with a defective tube that was providing air to the engine. This piece was replaced with under $200 and all seems good with my car now where the Nissan certified professionals from this location quoted me a full replacement of the CVT transmission for 5K.
I can't imagine how these people can still be in business to rip off people that have no idea whats happening with their cars. Lesson learned and good luck to those who dare to use their services.<//text>< Date>

My mom and I made an online appointment to test drive a used Hybrid Altima. We were greeted right away by a tall light haired older gentleman at the parking lot and asked if he could be of help. It was nice and friendly welcome. He directed us to Washington who he thought was the right person we were looking for. That was very helpful of him to do that. Washington was very professional and quick to get the keys for us to test drive. He showed us 3 other cars very patiently told us their differences and features. He was knowledgeable about the Nissans and Kia Optima.  I liked the 2010 Nissan Altima and decided to make an offer. The application process for financing was easy.  I did not get the deal I hoped for but $14/month more than my target. Signing the papers was fast after that. This car was for my son, he said it was a nice experience, I would go there again to buy another car someday.<//text>

I just traded my Nissan Juke to the SL_AWD. Moving out of state need a car that can handle the snow. Looking forward to having this new model. It's really amazing having the back up camera. Also, the heated seats are perfect especially because I have a bad back. Jeannine Phillips came around a second time to help me get my car deal situated. I got such a good deal!!! Thank you!!!!One Year Ago: 2011 October: My Nissan Juke is the best car I've ever driven. Thanks to Jeannine Phillips, I was able to find the perfect car for me :) It's funky and cool, fast, and economical. I can't wait to have this car for years to come. Jeannine was able to make me feel comfortable and confident the whole way through, and I left the dealership glowing! Thanks Nissan Weseloh for everything!</review>

An honest review means a lot to me and I think it helps any business or organization to achieve it ultimate goal. Also from the customer perspective, a review helps others to understand what they are likely to expect. Here is my review for Ocean Nissan based on my recent business with them

Sales Department
----------------

1. No one was pushy (A typical sales style that possibly most hate).

2. Right from the moment you park your car and step in, people are happy to see you and willing  to help you. Always expect a big smile from most of them.

3. Hooman Keyvan is an amazing person and man who sticks to his words.. Always a winner for me in any profession. If you want your next Nissan talk to him. A genuine person.

4. The Sales Management team is very good and would tell you what they can and what they cannot do.

Service Department
------------------

1. The service department was responsible for applying the Enviroguard and they took some time as a loaner was available.

2. They service quality was good and I am hoping to get outstanding service as I step in to get my servicing in the future done.

3. I wish they have more loaner, so that customers donot need to wait for longer to get their work done.

Dealership
-------------

1. Clean and nice ambiance.

2. I heard that the owners visit it regularly and that I am sure shows their passion in the business.

3. Good selection of vehicles to choose from.

4. Car Doc and Enviroguard are good options that not many dealerships provide.

5. They want new and existing customers to come to them and that tell me that they take pride in their service and customer.

6. Personally would have loved to see some more tea options in the waiting area.:)

Hope what I have written helps others and hope the dealership and its people exceed my expectations all the time.< /Text>

<Review>I recently bought a "cream puff" of a Honda CRV-EXL (07) and dealt with Rob Chianese, the salesman. He did a terrific job, encouraged me to make the 40 mi drive down from Long Beach to see this CRV after I inquired on an internet search. EVERYthing he told me about the SUV was right on target. It was a beauty, and even though hi mileage, he worked a deal for me that included assurances (a drive train warranty - in writing!) even though it was advertised (quite appropriately) "as is".  Rob was a straight talker, no pressure, guy, and made the difference in getting me into the car that I love, in just a couple hours - test drive, lots of questions, dealing with my car insurance, etc. Oh, and thanks to his excellent deal, they threw in tax and title at the price I could afford. Amazing.  I didn't think they could or would do it at my low price offer. They found a way. So I highly recommend Rob and the dealership. If you go see him, I think you'll agree.   -    John E.

This is my second purchase from this Dealer and both times I was VERY pleased.  I bought a pre-owned Kia Soul a year ago and traded it in yesterday for a Nissan Juke!  It was a pleasurable experience all around.  David Martinez is an excellent &quot;specialist&quot;.  He knew his product and he made me feel comfortable and I felt that he was truly there to help me make the best deal.  I wanted to keep my same car payment on the new Nissan Juke as I had on the pre-owned Kia Soul and I guess that was rather unreasonable of me.  After the back and forth between David and Bill Taylor, I was pleased with the offer and I'm only paying $95.00 more per month for a brand new vehicle!!  Weseloh Nissan makes buying a car a great experience!  They even gave me a sandwich when I said I was hungry!  I would recommend this Dealer to everyone who wants a good deal and a extra friendly experience!<//text>

<username>Shenandoah Diehl</username><Date>1357190634449<//Date><rate>5</rate><text>If you don't have a personal service manager for your vehicle that you trust 100%, I would like to introduce you to you Sabina Heineman. She is THE most trustworthy service manager in the industry. She makes recommendations for her customers as if their vehicle were her own, never recommends unnecessary services, and is honest and thorough, every detail is taken care of. She is friendly, sincere, asks about our other family members (remembers everyone's names!) and is simply a good person that looks out for your best interest. You will never feel like she's trying to "sell" you something, you will feel like she's making sure everything is taken care of as quickly, inexpensively and thoroughly as possible. She applies any discounts available, without you having to ask, offers a shuttle or free rental car services (the rental car counter is literally a few feet from her desk, how convenient!) for major services to your vehicle so you're not out for a day or having to arrange for someone to drop you off/come pick you up, and keeps you up to date if there is a new findings with your vehicle during servicing (I recommend replacing this - our technician found that it is damaged/needs replacing.) I LOVE that she simply says "I recommend" rather than "do you want us to" - I have no idea what a car needs, and when other dealers ask you if you want to pay for something, you feel like they are trying to make an extra buck, while Sabina tells it to you like it is. She serviced my previous Nissan (1991 Hardbody) when it was 18 years old, and told me truthfully "this is damaged, but replacing it will cost (X amount) and nothing bad will happen if you wait in it or just ignore it - it will just make noise" - then left it up to me. She saved me $1800 for a service I would have done with another dealer worried my truck would fall apart if I did not replace the part. Honesty, integrity, and sincerity - Sabina is the best. We take our 370Z to her to be pampered, and after being disappointed by countless other dealerships servicing my Toyota truck (literally 4 other Toyota dealerships who tried to sell me services that the next one said were unnecessary, and having repairs cost way more than quoted without any communication from my service manager there, the leaving me with a feeling of distrust), I began taking my TOYOTA to Sabina at Weseloh Nissan. She said they will service ALL makes and models!! She took extra time to call the Toyota dealership, make sure she had all the info as to what services were factory recommended for my milage and vehicle use (we use 4WD a lot in Big Bear and Mammoth (yay!), then made sure they had all the specific  tools to service my specific model, then even went down the street to Toyota for the parts they needed without a markup! Awesome! In summary, Sabina is the best, you will love her, appreciate her, and be surprised that you finally found a services manager you really trust. Thanks, Sabina!!</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Horrible service.

I call to schedule a service and I am told to show up the coming Saturday before 2.00pm, and I am scheduled for 2.00pm. I do that: the coming Saturday I drive 45 minutes to get there and the service guy says there there is no service scheduled for me, that service is going to close soon and all I can do is leave.

Clearly the guy could not care less.

It's the second time in 1 year that these guys do something like this to me: obviously they will never see me or any of my friends again.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Very bad experience I bought a car for $ 12 thousand and with the financing I paid a total of 30 thousand dollars, it took a long time to attend to me, I spent first with one person then with another and in the end with another I did not explain well in the contract they are a fraud
