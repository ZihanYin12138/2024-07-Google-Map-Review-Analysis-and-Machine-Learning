Best bike I’ve ever been to. Paul’s work is excellent and his prices are incredibly reasonable.  He is the only place in the valley that does wielding, I believe. Cant recommend enough.<//text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>An old-school shop, with an old-school proprietor to help and repair just about anything.  Very honest, very reasonable and 100% unvarnished bicycle culture.

This is not a fancy shop. There are no nice displays, there's not any good lighting, it's frankly a mess. This is where you go to get a great deal on a used bike, to get something fixed quickly and competently when other shops would tell you to throw it away, to meet a mechanic that can not only fix that old part but that has spares for it. This is the type of shop where you can shake the mechanic's greasy hand, feel good about the impact that a six-pack of beer can have for a job well done, ask the owner to teach your son how to change his own tire, meet bicycle riders who ride for fun and never, ever really see anybody wearing lycra...haha!

This is also a shop that makes, and supports the reconstruction of old cruiser bikes, crazy old school mountain bikes and insanely fun underground races that you can easily join, just by walking into the store and reading a flyer.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEvURNKJYKJlIEyMWXABOL9TwLlsgWBlIdjXdO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9zgxRw61V6c17EkktNCI_cmLSXS55lqvtnCNp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqzUGxiOJk-Vhv7EFW4_CVoCk_uPLntL3HHiAX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhdf0o6-XxOfa6L2jI7H3RSnIbnyt1qPvXU6Lm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOE3BdBpqoNLkKEXhuinrfY7yHoH5AKk6PLPSoL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrQQGBa3v7zUNE1VLRX8AHUjWaJqBVA5Ji9_5Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgHclyOBRBCXyRIWMeB_zgPb7mxgy8iVvuE15q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

After he agreed to do my very simple mineral oil break bleed, I drove way out of my way to get it dine ASAP.  Upon arrival he refuses to do the break bleed because the bike has a small electric motor on it (having NOTHING to do with the standard bike breaks that are on it).

The proprietor of this shop really knows his stuff and did an excellent job at repairing my older bicycle. He will patiently answer your questions and give you a breakdown of the work he has done. Please do keep in mind the following, though. He does not repair ebikes. Also, he has this strict policy of dealing with his customers in the order of arrival (without exception) so allow plenty of time when you visit. He does accept credit / debit cards and cash. Finally, please be advised that hasn't had on a face mask on any of my visits there but again, you can deal with him from the sidewalk without having to enter his store.</Text>

Atomic cycles is a great shop. Owned by down to earth guy named (ask him). He will not BS you, he will always do good work and at better prices than any of the other shops in the valley. Also plenty of bikes for sale here, pre-owned and in perfect working order. Do go here you will not regret it.</text>

<Text>FANTASIC. you won’t find another bike shop like this, super old school operation, no computer to be seen, no WiFi, no BS!
Great prices, great work, great service. It’s a one man show so you will not get passes from one person to another.

Because it’s a one man operation, just keep in mind you may need to be patient if he is busy or in the middle of something. He’s not the best multi-tasker, but give him a minute and you’ll get the undivided attention of all his expertise and experience two-wheeled wisdom.

It’s a hole in the wall, cramped, cluttered, and chock full of everything bicycle. Just how a real local bike shop should be!!< /Text>< name>

Not only did they fix my sons bike, parts and labor were very reasonable. Not only that, I thought I'd have leave it over night as he was about to close. Long story short my son was riding about ten minutes later. Awesome to deal with and highly recommend,< /review>< pictures>

Found Atomic via a google search while in the area, WOW!  A great / true bike shop.

He's not interested in retail, but rather providing a great bike experience for all riders.  Even organizes rides for old coaster bikes.

Has a great selection of used bikes at incredible prices.  Found an original Schwinn Predator there for a steal - Thanks Paul.< /text>

Paul is amazing.  Not only did he have the part I needed for my bike he did not overcharge like another shop I went to.  His service is amazing he tells it how it is and is fantastic.  Coming from someone who has worked in customer service for years I will never go to another shop.  Really go see him,  you will never go anywhere else.< /Text>

<Text>Super humble and honest dude. I'd choose his shop any day over any other place.

Paul is not only a master of his craft but a unique individual who's personal and professional integrity is put forth in every project he organizes and executes.
If you need a flat fixed or a tune up or some random bike part.. chances are, he got you.. He also has a sick collection of all kinds of used bikes.
If you are in the market for a custom bike check out Genuine Bicycle Products and get yours now! worth every penny. Custom made and assembled right here in the USA!< /Review>< pictures>

Paul is an excellent guy. Don't go here looking for a big selection of new bikes. He mainly deals in used bikes, parts and repairs.<//Review>

TUNE UP AND ALIGNMENT PLUS BRAKES (HYDRAULIC FLUID AND BLEED  FRONT AND BACK DISCS) PLUS TEST SHIFTERS AND BRING TIRES UP TO PROPER WORKING PRESSURE. IN AND OUT IN ABOUT  A HALF HOUR AND MY BILL WAS VERY, VERY FAIR. THANK YOU PAUL FOR THE EVERYTHING.< /review>

Paul is great! I took my bike in becuase I had two flat tires. Had the tires and tubes replaced. Also he fix my squeeking breaks. I also got a basic tune up(25.00 dollars). Great store! Great workers!</Review>

<Text>First come, first served. I overheard the owner say that to a customer trying to negotiate "better service". If you just want an overpriced PoS bike, then go to Walmart. When you want a fair deal or a bike needs repaired go to Paul. There is only one bike shop in the SFV that has the stock pile of used gear a mechanic that knows how to repair new and vintage bikes. I've brought him both and been happy with the repairs. If you want an honest mech who doesn't rip you off and does good work, I recommend Atomic Cycles.< /Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< pictures>

I contacted this florist when i looked up top florists in corona and needed a arrangement sent on the same day (Saturday) although the driver had finished deliveries that day, the gentleman i spoke to on the phone said no problem he would take it personally on his way home and although i didnt know what kind of arrangement to get but he offered ideas to me as we agreed on the arrangement approximately 2 1/2 hrs later my sister called to say thank for the most beautiful flower arrangement she has ever received from anyone ever ( she is in her late 50s)..4 days later she sent me a video of the flowers saying they are looking even more beautiful as the flowers are opening ...i never write reviews but i HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FLORIST FOR THEIR PROFESSIONALISM Fresh Flowers and beautiful arrangement that made me look like the best brother in the world....Thanks again</text>

< Review>
Corona Rose helped make my COVID quarantine wedding a DREAM! Sophia was so easy to work with and so helpful and accommodating. She asked for pictures of arrangements I liked and not only made those a reality, but really brought them to life. The colors were stunning, and the flowers were gorgeous and complimented each other so well. I ordered an arch arrangement, bridal bouquet, bridal flower crown, centerpieces, standard arrangement, corsages, and a boutonniere. The price was right, and just so worth every penny. I plan to have a "real", larger wedding next year and will absolutely use them again. Thank you, Corona Rose!</Review>

<Text>Ordered one of their birthday arrangements two days before the birthday. When they did not have the exact flowers we wanted, they not only ensured that they kept the color scheme and replaced them but also made a much larger arrangement for no extra charge.

The final product was even better than what we originally wanted and they delivered it around the time we wanted as well!

Do no hesitate to bring your business here! They will take care of you to the best of their abilities.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<text>My daughter  had her wedding in Corona.   Our family  has been in the flower  business  in New Mexico  since 1922 so naturally  my daughter  wanted her Mom to do her wedding  flowers.  The owners and staff at Corona  Rose were so gracious  to allow me to order flowers through  their shop, use their refrigeration and went to great lengths to  share their work space with me for three days.  The flowers were beyond my quality expectations  and their hospitality was second to none.  I would highly recommend  this shop.  Beautiful people, amazingly talented staff and so willing to help any way they can. Thank you all again.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dcc86c6c34321f:0x873d9e886846ff7< /Gmap_id></record>

Had a last second need for some beautiful flowers, I didn't catch the gentlemen's name, very professional and flowers were fresh. I asked him to substitute some of the decor in the set and he knocked it out of the park and delivered the flowers promptly. Great job! Highly recommended!< /review>

Thank you, all the way from Canada! Fantastic service and a website that makes it easy to do business with them. I forgot to mention a discount offer when I ordered on-line and they returned my call the next day to say they would apply the discount. We've used them twice and will continue to do so!  Their e-mail reminders are pretty great too. Cheers!<//review>

I don't even know where to start... Julie did an AMAZING job on my wedding bouquet! (And everything else) I walked in there  about 2 weeks before my wedding and showed Julie a picture of what I wanted.  picture is proof of how amazing her work is! I will definitely be ordering more from this flower shop/Julie. Thank you for making my wedding extra beautiful! I love it!!!!<//Review>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>I went in to order flowers for my mothers funeral, The women their were extremely helpful. They had a notebook full of pictures of past arrangements they had done; a large refrigerated case displaying actual flower arrangements; & also took me into the back to show me more examples of arrangements particularly suited to display around a cremation urn. They knew what to ask. The flowers were delivered & set up on time for the service. We took these 2 arrangements home with us & left others to be placed by the grave, because these were just too pretty to leave behind.

The 2 arrangements we purchased were breathtaking. Everyone commented on how beautiful they were. I couldn't have asked for anything more. Spectacular service, a good floral design eye, and quality flowers used. Thanks so very much.< /review>< user_id>

GREAT LOCAL FLORIST!! I've been buying all my flowers from Corona Rose Flowers, and I love these people. Sandi is the most energetic, sweet, and helpful person I've ever seen at a flower shop. They are always there to help me select the perfect flowers for any occasion. Every time I buy flowers from Corona Rose, they are fresh, and I always walk out with a big smile because of the great service I receive. I don't know how they do it, but they have this unusual ability to make me laugh every time I'm there!  Whether you need flowers for a birthday, wedding, anniversary, or anything else, you can be confident that the flowers will not look bad the next day...they pay a lot of attention to the freshness, which I really love!< /review>

New to the area,
was going out to my sister-in-law’s daughter’s graduation and last minute I wanted to get her something for a quick gift.  We went to Ralph's first, and they had a HORRIBLE and unhealthy-looking selection, so left there.  I checked yelp and just went for the next choice which led us to some random place where I was told that ready-made arrangements were available to choose from.  After showing up, I found that didn’t have anything, and the time was ticking, so instead of just waiting I swooped on over to Corona Rose Flowers.  They were right across the street and with such short timing, I was relieved to find that they actually had a pretty good selection.  By the time we got there, a lot of their arrangements were already sold, but luckily they had the flowers and colors that our young graduate apparently loved.  Corona RFG really had some beautiful arrangements that were affordable. The staff was more than helpful and eager to help as they were understanding of our situation!  I will use this flower shop again!<//Text>

Ordered a spring boquet for delivery,  I never seen what it looked like till it arrived. Beautiful! I had to actually touch and smell to make sure it was real! This place gets my vote. I will only buy from them. Thank you Corona Rose flowers!<//Review>

And now I understand substitutions and slight variations of course no problem.
but ordering the deluxe really I thought it would look so much better, just very disappointed its has less flowers than the standard version advertised on the site.
Looks like a $19.99 market deal not a deluxe $100 special from the florist.
I dont normally bother with reviews but this was a thank you for a special person and wanted to express that to them.
And I will add here that the receiver did love it.

but what I ordered was to be at the least a close version of that awesome
Christmas special shown on the site, and bumped it up to a deluxe order just to make sure it would have more than a few flowers, Very sad.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Great selection of food in an unpretentious setting. Fish, chicken and steak entrees with a good variety of sides.  The cucumber salad was great and it tasted fresh.  Everything is prepared the way you want it.  You order at the counter and they bring the meal to your table.  Self serve soft drinks are also available.  Staff is helpful and friendly!< /review>

My first time eating at fishermen grill and i must say the fish was fresh and delicious. The fried fish and chips and coleslaw was my first and can't wait for my next experience. The staff was really nice and helpful and the cashier Dez was really nice and friendly. I will be back for more..thanks to the owner George. Great place..< /text>

<Review>They make a killer Nutella Latte, but other than that I can’t recommend this place based on customer service. I know they treat their locals well and have seen it first hand, but I don’t see that same level of service with others. I work as a flight attendant and I usually frequent Caffe Roma for breakfast during my layovers because they offer the Nutella latte. I typically get some variation of avocado toast as well and my most recent visit was less than stellar. There wasn’t much avocado on the toast, additionally it had been tossed around in the bag when I picked up my order.

Instead of just writing it here and sharing it, I went back inside to inquire about it as it’s something I usually get. If they’ve cut back based on costs, I would have been fine but this wasn’t the case. They said they would add a few more pieces and all they did was mash the avocado slices to make it look like more were added. Going back in a second time didn’t feel like it would resolve the situation or be a positive interaction. They had a chance to fix it the first time and they settled for deception.

Check my review history, I don’t tend to write negative reviews and give restaurants the benefit of the doubt as I worked as a waitress for 6 years.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Fantastic people! Greeted all their (MANY) regulars by name! Made us out of town’ers feel SO welcome.
Both avocado toast we tried were AMAZING! And every coffee/latte/espresso we had was perfect!!! SO much better tasting than SBux, Peete’s, etc.
Go there if you’re staying anywhere near the airport!<//Text>

Very nice Cafe with large glass walls and sunlight.  Their coffee is so good they actually supply it to other shops.  Reasonable prices though they are funny in custom orders cost different prices depending on the day... Lol.  The brother who comes in is great.  The sister that owns it is very personable.  If you look carefully you will see the founders seated in the corner table with friends.  Charming people, decent food, great brew and tea.<//Review>

<time>1581847121303</time><rate>4<//rate><review>This place is super underrated. In my opinion, it's the best coffee shop in Ktown. And yes, there is parking! There's a parking lot with plenty of spaces right behind it. I recommend the document latte (hot or iced), mocha, and the cold brew. All there coffees have this distinct flavor which makes it so good. The ambiance in there is pretty creative as well.. they have buckets as lights and a last supper photo with their employees. Lol so dope. If you're looking for something better than basic, this is the place.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Interesting place, I ordered their signature Golden Buddha after having to remind the staff (didn't seem to care) because they weren't making my drink, it came out quite quickly but it was beyond burned and not flavorful at all. I returned it and asked to get a regular latte. I asked about the price difference since the Golden latte was a whopping $6.50 for a 16oz and she said she couldn't refund even though I paid cash. She said she could make it a double but I'm sensitive to caffeine so after being made to feel awkward she refunded me a couple bucks.< /review>

Very sweet family owned cafe. Great spot for a grab-and-go or a leisurely morning coffee. The space is spacious and comfortable. Plenty of outdoor seating for those warmer days.</Text>

Very overpriced sandwiches and cakes for mediocre food. One might just come here for the location and WIFI, but greed is unacceptable. The food quality continues to go down while the prices go up.

And the owner always complains/ tries to maintain credit card limits per transaction even if you've already spent $40 with a hearty tip additional on top only 15 minutes earlier. I have never seen such a foolish act to push away customers, demanding more money even after they've spent enough to go to an actual sit-down restaurant already.

If the service, quality, and price is not there, I see no reason to be a patron. I much prefer Cafe Central with very kind service and incredible food in downtown Burlingame.< /Text>

I love this place.  It is my favorite place for a casual business meeting.  The coffees are great, even by European tastes.  The atmosphere is open and bright.  The parking is easy.  The free WiFi makes it easy to do business.  And all my guests can find it easily off 101.</Text>

Solid coffee place. Go for the Nutella late - something worth trying. Breakfast croissant is solid as well.< /Review>

Third time is usually a charm. Wrong. Staff is always so unfriendly. Staff or managers are slightly rude towards each other or employees. Can’t tell who is in charge but they are all kinds of messy. I saw them re-steam milk that was sitting.< /Review>

<Review>The family-run vibe, faster pace and more intimate interaction gives Caffe Roma a more legitimate and memorable experience when going to buy your coffee. They roast all of their own beans in house, do mainly espresso, and definitely don't cut short on the coffee.

Great place to meet, get coffee, and actually enjoy it.</Review>< Gmap_id>

This Italian-inspired cafe has delicious coffee drinks and great food of varying types to go with it - bagels, several types of danish, cookies, salads, and more.  My personal favorite is their bagel lox (a bagel sandwich filled with lox [smoked salmon], cream cheese, cucumber, red onions, tomato [upon request], and plenty of pickled capers).  The staff is friendly and helpful, and they even have gone out of their way and delivered my order to me when I was unable to go to their location.</review>

I value good coffee. So it's nice to know that Coffee Roma roast it's own beans at the SF. Bryant Street location. The food and Italian dishes are freshly made on-site. The Millbrae location has comfortable seating and large sliding glass doors for fresh air. The parking is sometimes a little challenging.< /review>

Great place to stop for a quick breakfast or lunch and even an afternoon "coffee and".
It's counter service, but the staff is very accommodating and helpful.
We enjoyed sandwiches, lattes and some of their sweets.
Free wifi, clean, indoor and outdoor seating.

I look forward to trying a few other items on the list - and the daily specials.
Easy parking in the lot shared with Walgreens.<//Review>

This is one of my usual places I go to in the area. I often will set up meetings there or run in for lunch. The cafe is well set up with outdoor seating as well. The staff are friendly and helpful. The prices are OK but it is Burlingame area. The food is pretty solid I have tried a couple of there panini's which have good flavor but most of the time not warmed up all the way through. There baked goods are good but sometimes a little stale. I enjoy there iced Chai but have not tried there coffee before.</text>

<Text>What a place....I decided to stop there after driving  4 hours, with my daughters to take a break from traffic. Big mistake, first of all, was so looking forward to some of their pastries which looked very appetizing. Until  I was mocked by one of their employees (ALICIA) for asking for some time to try to decide.My daughter and I were going over their menu, and the owner asked this employee if she had asked us what we wanted to order, well she responded in SPANISH mocking me saying in a childish way, "that we were still deciding, so i  guess they need more time" mind you she did this in a rude smart alek way in  Spanish, which i fully understood, and was looking right at her and the owner when she did it. Didn't help the owner replied to her how funny she was in the way she was mocking me. Well needless to say I did approach her in Spanish and let her know I spoke Spanish and understood it very well.  First of all her mouth dropped in shock, and then she tried to justify what she had done, saying that she was just responding to boss's question in regards to seeing if she had attended to us.  Well I called her on her immature
action and she stayed quiet,  told her she was rude and that her
mocking me was not appreciated.  It''s a shame that such a nice
business would tolerate such employees insubordination in their establishment mocking their own customers,  and just sitting back
and finding it humorous. I know I am just one person but I see here that
I haven't been the only one that was treated rudely. Hope this place gets
their act together and actually finds good respectable staff and actually
appreciates their customers. A real shame , such beautiful and delicious
looking pastries and menu but horrible customer service and management!</Text>< Pictures>

Horrible sandwich.   They advertise hot panini sandwich but bring it out cold and then to warm it they use a microwave.  Why advertise panini sandwiches and not have a panini machine.   The chicken was like rubber and if there was cheese it was invisible.  WASTE OF GOOD MONEY!!</review>

Awesome, cool staff, perfectly frothed soy latte and delicious gluten free fried eggs and toast. Thank you for a great start to the day!

Chilling at the granite topped table looking out the big, tall, bright windows and laid back jazzy vocal background music in big sunglasses makes me feel like the most stereotypical yuppilennial priss on the planet, but this place is great.< /Text>

It's a shame nice place misrepresented by staff.

Staff in this place had the most miserable faces in SF seemed like they just got out of the worst fight moments before I walked in.

I walked in and was ignored for over two minutes so I started by greeting them and the answer was please wait. Oops that's not what I expected for an answer.</Review>

<Review>A decent study spot  but don't expect great service. Expect to repeat your order several times and expect to deal with employees who are just there to get the job done. Like the employees, the coffee gets the job done, but nothing to write home about.<//Review><rate>3<//rate>< Pictures>

Sundays here are for church, football and donuts. You can stop being invited places if you bring lousy donuts.  I got two dozen donuts for work, and let me tell you, this place is the real deal. It's a little hole in the wall, and three old guys in Navy Veteran caps were talking in the corner over coffee.  This is definitely The Spot.  You know, the spot where the old guys sit every day and complain about their grandkids and drink coffee.  Anyway, these donuts are Midwest-quality, moist, fluffy deliciousness, and they get this fat Michigander's stamp of approval.<//text><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

The owner/ employees have the best customer service. They have a broad menu. From donuts to churros..  even lumpia and other savory things. A wide selection of cold/iced coffees and drinks. You can also place in a big order of donuts in advance. Everything is at a great price and everything tastes so good! Highly recommend it here.< /review>

<text>The place is tiny but clean. Food looks great with reasonable price. The staff is truly friendly and welcoming. They also have daily special at $7.5 and $9.5, and combos at roughly $10.5. I’ll come back for lunch 🥗</text>< user_name>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Our friend likes this place a lot so she took us here to buy a few kimbap rolls as a midnight snack for our hotel room. We had already been eating our fair share of Korean food and were full, but this place also did not disappoint! It was sooo good. I loved the little kimbap rolls. They were the perfect bite. Each one had a ton of flavor and all the ingredients were so fresh!  The fish cake soup was also a bargain and my son loved the broth. They will make anything on the menu, fresh and made to order if it is not out. The spam and bulgolgi rolls were fantastic. They should franchise and bring one to where we live. I would buy fresh rolls everyday!< /Review>< Name>

Food is great.  Especially Kimbap.  Chicken wing was also pretty good.

However, I had to wait for 30min to get the food, even though there was no one infront of us at 2:30 pm.  Also, portions are much smaller than the photos would seem to represent.

As tasty as their kimbaps are, it is in no way enough to overcome price, wait time, and portion size.</Review>

<Text>Mmm... yummy kimbaps. This is a cute little shop with lots of mini kimbap selection. Today I had their Squid, bulgogi, tuna, & Katsu kimbaps. I especially love the Katsu & bulgogi ones! Such a satisfying light lunch & wallet friendly ($5+changes!!) You bet I’d be back to get more & try other kimbaps. They got noodles, soups, Korean porridge too! 😻👍🏻
About the ambience, felt like it’s run by a family with mom & pop behind the counter prepping kimbaps & daughter running the cashier. (I didn’t ask though) clean & comfy environment with plenty of benches & tables. Feels like modern coffee shop.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2XXpOoiAYmcFKpZtcHCKEwFpC0RIivRrF5bH4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c77ce73c9b61:0x7541fe5a33ae78cb<//Gmap_id></record>

Quick, freshly-made, snackable portions of Kimbap, with a smile - tuna was my favorite, and the homemade rice punch (식혜) was delicious!

Storefront parking can be a challenge, but that’s Koreatown...< /text>

Food is pretty good - big portions! One of the dishes took a long time and the staff threw in some freebies. Good service 🙌🏼

Spicy rice cakes were cut a bit too thick so taste wasn’t quite as good.<//Text>

< Review>
Mari Kimbap shop is an excellent spot to check out if you're looking for a cute place to grab simple, bite-sized Kimbap and not feel too full after finishing your meal. I love how most of their Kimbap options are set-up entree style where you can pick the meats you want for you and your friends. It's nice having variety instead of being stuck with the same Kimbap for the full meal. Best of all each Kimbap is the same price and if you order at least $10 you can use their yelp check in offer for another Kimbap for free! Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a light meal.<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Advantages - The shop is clean and tidy.
Disadvantages - the place is narrow. The chair is uncomfortable.
The worst drawback - the service is horrible.
I see there is a water purifier in the back and I buy water.
It 's not BOTTLE WATER, but you should buy some water. There is a shop for water.
I have not been there since.

장점 ㅡ가게도 깨끗하고 맛도 깔끔합니다.
단점 ㅡ 자리가 좁습니다. 의자가 불편합니다.
최악의 단점 ㅡ 서비스는 꽝입니다.
뒤에 정수기있는거 보이는데 물을 사 먹으랍니다.
BOTTLE WATER가 아니라는데도 물은 사먹으라네요. 물도 안주는 가게는 첨입니다.
그 이후론 안갑니다.< /Review><userid>110851848598856820282< /userid></record>

<Review>I came here to order Vietnamese iced coffee. They made it fresh and let me tell you, it was literally the best thing I’ve ever drank.

They are good about following COVID protocols so I felt very safe ordering from them. They also deliver very kind and courteous service.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I especially like their pho, woven rice noodle sheets, and garlic noodles. Try to call them directly for takeout orders, because the 15% taken by grubhub is a big chunk of $. They pick up the phone quickly, and are always grateful for the consideration!</Text>< Time>

In a city full of vietnamese options I find to be disappointing at best, this place is a hidden gem.  Their vermicelli yellow curry soup is seriously something I dream about.<//Text>

<review>Comfort food for the cold weather.  Bun rieu was different from your usual bowl of pho but oh so good. Bun bo hue has some heat to it... So if you like spicy, go for it! I absolutely love the Vietnamese  drip coffee...brings me back to when I was in vietnam for vacation... My go-to drink for an extra boost of energy - caffeine high!</review><user_id>103348759118206519799<//user_id><Name>Geraldine Loo< /Name><resp>None<//resp>< pics>

<text>This place is great. The chicken curry, the garlic noodles and pho are a must try. Bac lieu is family owned and the staff is so nice. The 5 spice chicken is also really yummy. Help support them, they must survive at all cost during this trying time. =)</text>< rating>

Noodles and Soup lovers would love this place because there are various kinds of noodles and soup recipes around. Also Spring Rolls, Spiced Quail are great here. Foods are treated in a healthy-looking way. They care about customers' hygiene.</review>

Great Vietnamese restaurant. We loved the Beef Pho and Chicken Woven Rice Noodle Sheet. The spring rolls are good too. They even have whole coconuts. Yum!<//Review>

<text>Comfort food for the cold weather.  Bun rieu was different from your usual bowl of pho but oh so good. Bun bo hue has some heat to it... So if you like spicy, go for it! I absolutely love the Vietnamese  drip coffee...brings me back to when I was in vietnam for vacation... My go-to drink for an extra boost of energy - caffeine high!</text>< Pics>

The Bun Bo Hue was terrific, Vietnam quality. My wife liked her seafood soup, both using the same noodles which were done well.

We had Che for dessert, which was as good as San Jose.

I'll certainly come back.

[9/1/19 I'm upgrading the review to 5 stars , because this is officially the best Bun Bo Hue I've had in the US.

For reference it was Bourdain who said that's the best soup in the world over a bowl in the city of Hue]</Review>< Resp>

Their Bun Mam is authenic but beware, it's made from fermented fish and is an acquired taste if you didn't grow up eating it. I also enjoyed the dry pho and my friend enjoyed the bun thit nuong-, their five spiced chicken also hits the spot too.< /Review>

We are training couple new staff at this time, so it will take them some time to learn everything and adapt to the daily changes that comes with operating any business during a pandemic.  Was it the checkout/payment part when you picked up a call in order that was slow? Was food not ready when you arrived at the promised time? Did you call in or order delivery? All deliveries are through third parties so we have absolutely no control over delivery time despite status you see on the app (very common to have prepared food sitting for a long time without driver showing up during busy hours).  Were you a driver yourself who received an alert from your app that tells you food is ready when we just received order 5 minutes prior? We prepare all orders fresh upon order, so it takes time, and we’ve notified the companies behind the apps regarding technical error of notifying drivers too early to come pick up food and they’ve acted rudely or violently after being notified food is not ready, but the response we received was simply “we’re aware and working on fixing the issue”. Issue been reported for months multiple times and still not resolved.  If anything that is within our control, meaning call in orders for pickup, then we will work on improving.  Many of our regular customers have noted that we often run rather than walk just to cut customer waiting time as much as possible.'}< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

Shrimp pancakes and pho bac leiu special were flavorful and yummy. The bac leiu noodle soup (house special) is not something you can find anywhere and  has a unique flavor. Hard to fail with Vietnamese ice coffee. Definitely will be coming back to try some of their other dishes!< /review>

(Translated by Google) I ate tomato noodle soup and chicken garlic noodle and it was so delicious. Chicken is especially crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The amount is a little big.

<Text>Went for the hot food. The meat was super tasty. Im glad i got the salsa on the side because it was really spicy for me. The beans were good. The rice was a little bland tho. Id defenitly go back for the tacos. Price and portions were reasonable.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Fantastic great local friendly stop, with great food and bakery items.  Truly a great stop for a nice and surprising home cooked Hispanic meal.  There meat case is a picture to enjoy surpassed only by the quality of the product and the professionalism of the family.<//Review></record>

<Review>Long story short, my 12 year old and I went shopping at forever21 today I must say we had a good ol' time in this store. Our shopping experience was wonderful. From the music that was playing, to the visitors the store attracts, up to the clothing item I tried on, the vibe was peaceful. It's not too many store I go shopping in and feel this way about. So I rate the Forever21 store off Newport rd in Menifee with 5 stars..< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Response>

The clothes are suppose to be brand new! One had a whole in the chest area and the other in the butt area. Totally not worth it specially because I'm pregnant and it's hard to get around since I can't do much walking due to pregnancy issues.  Really bummed!!!< /Review>< Pics>

I was just in Forever 21, Menifee this evening and I want to take the time to say how wonderful the staff was especially with all the craziness that is going on with the holidays. It was extremely busy today, clothes all over the floor (by the way people if you drop any clothing items or something falls while flipping through clothes PICK IT UP!), children running crazy up and down the store, and each associate behind that register continued to work that line down, with a smile on their face, and a Merry Christmas for each customer they rang up. I thought they all did wonderful!! I wish I got the names of the associates but I didn't. All I know is that there was two girls and one guy at about 6pm on 12/23. Good job guys!  If nobody has told you yet today you all did awesome!!! By the way I love Forever 21!</Text>

I always enjoy checking your website to see what interesting new pieces you've sourced for sale.  As I particularly love clothing made in Italy, I appreciate the fact that you continually feature many Italian sartorial treasures for purchase by your customers.  While I live too far away to visit your store in Carmel on a regular basis, I do try to stop in every few years to see again how beautifully you display your wares.  Keep up the great work!

Best regards,

This is one of the nicest men's stores I have ever seen. Great selection, beautiful fabrics, exquisite style. Julian was personable and professional.  Maloof's in Burlingame has always been my favorite men's store, but Khakis has a larger variety of styles.< /text>

Jim is the owner and having worked for him many many years ago I can attest to his extraordinary attention to detail! If you're looking for a tailored suit he's the man to see. Clothing in the store has always been varied and excellent quality. Coming back to Carmel it's nice to see the store going strong!<//Text>

Each garment I have bought here is well made, looks smart and has a refined texture.  Khakis is the single best gentlemen's store I have visited, offering tailored fine suits, sports jackets,  trousers and jeans, and stocking a wide variety of formal and casual shirts, silk ties, shoes, leather jackets and sweaters. There's a sales section in the basement with excellent clothing if you're working to a budget. Every item is beautifully presented, and the sales associates are practical and obliging.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808de6149324e99f:0xba7f3def926c06fe< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>We visited in April and spent time looking around.  I have never been to a store with more things I wanted to buy, which were in stock and within reach of my price range..  We got great service from Hayleigh and walked out with two new pairs of Aldens.  I could have done even more damage but I will be back.  My wife liked it just as well.   Great job.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Name>cesar molina< /Name><text>I bought a dining set on early June 2020 and a week when i got my table delivered it was scraped in the corner and it had drag marks i had to schedule a technician and i was told by customer service i would get my table fixed! Instead of giving me a new product in good condition! Is now September 26th and i still don't have my table fixed and dealing with customer service has been stressful and nothing but a pain! Buying new furniture should be exciting it shouldn't be STRESSFUL im so disappointed at this place.< /text><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80851245b8b01dd1:0x656eca8e6787e1b5< /GmapID></record>

<name>Geeraff</name><Rating>5<//Rating><Date>1615583194917<//Date><Review>Bill was absolutely amazing to work with. My fiancé and I had been looking for a sofa set since we were finalizing a few things to move into a new place. We had our eyes on a sofa that we absolutely loved from the jump. Bill was the first individual to approach us and ask how we were doing, which is a huge plus! He had let us know what specials were going on and to let him know if we had anymore questions. Long story short we decided to finance the sofa even though we didn’t have the exact measurements and honestly wasn’t sure if it would even fit. We finalized our paperwork with the new place and we’re devastated that the sofa we had just purchased was too big. Bill had told us to reach out to him if this was the case and sure enough he made sure to take care of us. As we came back to look at another sofa we were interested in, Bill made sure to have whatever we had put down will be applied to the new sofa and it was absolutely perfect! In the end we love our new sofa and it wouldn’t have been possible without Bill helping us the entire way. He was patient, understanding this was our first home and did not pressure us at all to get something we didn’t want. Bill listened to all of our needs, all of our questions and went above and beyond making sure we got what WE wanted and fit for US. Our delivery was even sooner than the one we had first picked so it was PERFECT!!!

Thank you so much Bill, we appreciate your help and all that you did for us.<//Review>< pics>

The shopping experience at Ashley’s needs major revamping. I tried calling my local store (Fairfield CA) several times and ended up at a call center after being on hold for 15 minutes, only to be told they are too busy to answer. This happened 7 times calling three separate stores directly.

I drove to the Fairfield store to purchase a small chest, and had to wait 30 minutes for my sales associate to finish with another customer before I could make a simple payment.

I told the sales manager (Jason) it was only one small item and I just needed to hand my credit card to someone to accept payment. I’ll I received in return is “your sale person will be with you shortly”, while at least 4 other associates and office staff were not on the phone or with a customer.

I stated I would buy the item as long as I was able to drive to the warehouse to pick it up the same day. Once they receive your money they forget how to provide customer service, or in this case, continued with the same lack of customer service.

I tried to purchase the item over the phone prior to going to the store and was told by the sales manager I had to come into the store since they don’t place orders over the phone. At that time I advised I needed to pick it up the same day and that I would drive to their warehouse to do so. So this wasn’t a new request I sprung on them when I arrived at the store.

Overall, this was a very poor experience, waste of time, and lack of customer service. I understand why RC Willey’s is opening stores in Northern Californian… even if they provide poor customer service they would still pick up customers Ashley’s is not taking care of.

The only good thing In this experience was the salesperson (Sherrie) was friendly and tried to help where she could.<//Text>

We got helped by Divina and she took care of all our needs, from showcasing furniture to ensuring we understood the financial side. We recommend asking for her anytime you visit.

<Text>What I liked about Ashley Home Store is no pressure from the sales reps and no one followed you around. We got a great sales rep named Bill Oneal in the Fairfield, CA location who was very knowledgeable and patient as I walked around and kept calling him over with questions. Very happy to have worked with him on my purchases.</Text><date>1617332911188< /date><Response>None</Response><user>112385971291718211581<//user><gmapID>0x80851245b8b01dd1:0x656eca8e6787e1b5< /gmapID></record>

Bill O. was amazing! Very attentive to our needs; and, did everything he could to get us the best price. The sale prices were great as well (Much less expensive than online pricing). We were there for about an hour or so; and, felt comfortable and taken care of the entire time. Thank you for your time Bill! Great customer service.< /text>

I ordered a couch November 30th of 2020. It is now 4 months later and I still have not received the couch. I have been rescheduled 6 different times. I honestly wouldn't mind the rescheduling, I am understanding and know that the shipping containers have been stuck at sea causing delays. However, I have never been told about any of the 6 dates. I only found out by calling the stores to confirm the delivery date. Twice I took days off from work and hired a mover to remove my old couch. I learned my lesson. The sales person who sold me the couch was nice. She had a good personality and was eager to close the sale. The day I bought my couch was the only time I had decent service. 4 months later, I have finally had enough and asked for a refund only to find out a "case would be open" and I would be notified within 3 business days whether I will receive my money back. The only reason I have waited this long is because the specific style of couch I wanted wasn't found in many stores. I don't write bad reviews, if I have a bad experience I don't write one at all. This entire experience has been too much and felt it was my obligation to tell people what I went through.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80851245b8b01dd1:0x656eca8e6787e1b5</GmapID></record>

<Review>Sherrie was a professional in every sense of the word. Her knowledge, care, and attention to detail was spectacular. Sherrie help us work through the challenging aspects of our major purchases. Hurray for her pleasant and thoughtful demeanor. Also, Sherrie’s supervisor, Devin was so family oriented and attentive. What a great day at Ashley Homestore!< /Review>< pics>

<Text>This place is a joke. Nothing in this store is worth the price that they are asking for. It's extremely overpriced for their items that don't even last a year. They want $200 for one lamp that isn't even nice. Hell no. I can buy 6 lamps at ross for that price that are way nicer. The workers also follow you around the store and watch you.. Like I under that they get paid for what they sell but it makes the customers uncomfortable. Also, when you walk in the store they make you check in. They ask you for your first and last name, and your phone number. I should have walked out at that point but I had wanted to go into that store for years. Complete waste of time. Save your time and your money and go to a smaller furniture store. They will give you better furniture for a better reasonable price.<//Text>< pictures>

Worst delivery experience ever had. Team leader was rude.
Refuse to assemble dresser mirror upon request. left dresser two feet away from wall. Imagine if an elderly person or single women has to deal with this.
I an 20 years customer will avoid Ashley for my next purchase if possible.</review>

<user>114887205281245735647<//user><Review>My experience with Ashley’s has been worse than awful. I have never written a review ever before.  I bought a couch after the thanksgiving weekend on sale. They said it would be delivered in 6 weeks at the beginning of January...my delivery date come and went and they said it would be delayed another month. I immediately canceled my order through Ashley’s furniture customer service. It has been ONE MONTH and I have still not received my refund. I have called about 20 times, I have spoken to more than 6 people who have said they would refund me...still yet no refund. I would NEVER buy anything from this horrible company again. I hope to get my refund soon< /Review><gmapID>0x80851245b8b01dd1:0x656eca8e6787e1b5</gmapID></record>

Sales people are nice.  Store is nice.  Everything after you walk out of the store is a nightmare.  Bought a living room suite in August of 2020, after f5 different delivery dates and reschedules, it is almost November and still no furniture.  Our last scheduled delivery date was today, 10/26/2020.  When I called to find out the time window I was informed our delivery was rescheduled for NOVEMBER 9TH.  No call, text, or e-mail from the company.  First delivery date was 10/04, then 10/19, then 10/26, then 11/04, then back to 10/26, now 11/09.  I'll be surprised if I see this furniture before 2021.< /review>

<review>Husband needed new recliner and Ashley was having a wonderful sale. Associate pointed us in the right direction. The second chair my husband tried was perfect. Gina approached us and handled the transaction in a timely manner, still covering everything we needed to know. She explained delivery may be delayed and was willing to show us other options, but we liked the chair so much we ordered two!< /review>< Pics>

<username>Amaka Watson</username><Response>None< /Response><review>Horrible and terrible experience! I waited almost three months for the delivery and my dresser was scratched with the nightstand broken. From the start the sales woman made numerous errors which caused numerous trips back to the store. My delivery date was put off about six times on top of the Fairfield store manager refusing to meet with me to hear or resolve my concerns. Instead I was given a gift card that's not enough to purchase anything in the store. Dysfunctional, not organized, failed to address issues. When you call for anything you experience long wait times to be bounced around to numerous people.In one call you can easily spend 1 and a half hours and speak to four different people with no resolution. Over priced cheap furniture not of good quality. I recommend buying furniture from anywhere else but here. If you take the time to do some research you'll find better quality furniture at a cheaper price somewhere else.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><GmapID>0x80851245b8b01dd1:0x656eca8e6787e1b5<//GmapID>< date>

I had a really bad experience upon buying furniture. Wouldn’t recommend anyone to go and buy stuff from Ashley store. They try manipulate people with their offers and insurance policies. Went  to  Fairfield Ashley store to buy sofa set and other accessories for our new home. representative there acted so nice, tried to gave us deals. Took 2 months to deliver furniture. Had a manufacturer defect in both sofa set and coffee table. We went back to store they next after delivery and showed them the pictures. Representative at the desk didn’t took us seriously. Had to a ask for there manager. Manager filed a claim and said that they would fix it once the technician visit to see the furniture. It’s been 15 days no one came. Why would we accept something that’s fixed. When we are paying the full amount for new stuff. Emailed Ashley customer service. Didn’t get any reply either.< /review>

Sales people are nice during the sale time buy never reply to your phone calls and never reply to your text messages.  Everything after that is a nightmare.  Bought one corner couch and they deliver it after 3 months piece by piece. Even I told them I needed the complete set. The delivery guys are worst then the store since they dump the old stuff in your house and when you refuse they just pretend to call the store and run away without any signature. When I visit the store , they are so mean and they don’t want to listen. Always making glad statements “ ok we will deliver in next week or so”.  Manager is so mean and the front desk is a nightmare , because I paid full in cash and they refused to return the money. After all they make false promises to give you compensation for the delay and hassle. They never return your call. ZERO star for them if I could.</review>

<text>Nice furniture but horrible, HORRIBLE customer service!!!!  Ordered electronic recliner & sofa & one did not have the plug in.  Guy dropping off items "called in missing plug in" & said the plug in would be mailed to us.  Called customer service to follow up on this & after being on hold almost 15 min., we were told nothing was ever noted about this.  We were put back on hold, then somehow disconnected.  Had to call back and wait another 15 min before finally speaking to someone.  Explained the situation again, only to be put back on hold.  Been holding for over 30 min. this time!  When we told the customer service rep. that it was hard to hear her, she replied "I don't have time to fix my headset".   Wow!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

A manager named Gary was helpful and accommodating. The last time my family and I went,  Holly and the manger on the floor (I forgot his name but he was a young slim handsome gentleman) also provided great customer service. Will definitely be returning to shop when needed. Thank you!</Text>

<Review>Fairfield Ashley has the worst customer service ever. Sometimes they have something cute or a good sale - but once u have to get a hold of someone for assistance with the delivery that gets delayed again and again, good luck-I’m convinced they don’t actually have a phone that takes incoming calls.<//Review>< Pictures>

I am extremely disappointment at the professional or lack their of of this company. After moving to California all the way from Georgia to start a new life, I wanted to purchase new furniture; Ashley was the recommended to location. I purchased a mattress, my toddler an entire bedroom set and myself a bedroom set. This purchase was made in early Aug. All my items arrived sporadically. With my bedroom set being the last to deliver; I waited until 29 Sep. Unfortunately, when I was called to confirm delivery I was told that all but ONE piece would be delivered 29 Sep. I had the choice to wait for ALL pieces or receive the pieces that arrived. The last piece (nightstand) was scheduled to arrive at the warehouse 3 Oct (from what I was told). 2 Oct, someone called me from the customer service center to advise me that my nightstand has arrived and wanted to schedule delivery for 13 Oct. I asked if they had an earlier date or location of the warehouse; I would be happy to pick it up (I knew that warehouse was in California). The female stated she would contact the warehouse to check on an earlier date and to see if it was possible for me to pick up my item; she never called me back. Today is 13 Oct and because she never called back I assumed the previous delivery was still standing. No one showed up. I called and called and called and kept getting the run around from previous reps. I was even told that my item is again on back order and is not scheduled until mid Dec. This is unacceptable and certainly NOT what I agreed on during the purchase. I was advised that my all my items would arrive on around 3 Oct. and this is because of a back order. I have spent the entire evening of my time calling the company to figure out whats happening. I was told to call the store (which made no sense at all but OK, I did) but was unable to get anyone on the phone. I am so upset with the way Ashley is handling this situation. This is definitely not good for business. I understand COVID has the shipping industry pretty much in a dead lock but please be transparent with your customers. With that being said, I will be having Ashley come pick up ALL their furniture. I want to give my business and money to a company who has earned it.

As I write this review, I have been on hold with Ashley for 30 mins….. AGAIN!!!!

<text>Prepare yourselves for possibly the worst customer service experience. Furniture was purchased in Jan 2020 and to date they have made 5 trips to my residence to fix their furniture blunders without having fixed it yet. Why?Because their logistics, management and communication are by far the worst I've ever seen in an Ashley. On countless occasions I've tried contacting the store for resolution, but conveniently the call gets re-routed and dropped every time. I have purchased from other stores with flawless execution, delivery and assembly. This store takes your money and forgets about the customer, fails to finish the transaction and compensate you for the hours you took away from work just watch the problems further compound. Some of us don't  have the luxury of taking folk's hard earned money, screwing them over, then turning their backs on them. I hope every active and retired vet in that area reads this and avoids the same headache. Thanks Perry, Henry, and Sherry for not coming through for a retired veteran. You all have proved to be a real class act.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Sales rep was awesome, unfortunately the follow up is atrocious. The delivery of my mattress has been a no call no show...twice. I can’t get anyone on the phone. I feel like I’ve been robbed. I just bought a three bedroom house and need everything. I know it won’t be from Ashley. I wish I hadn’t given them my money.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
The sales staff were very knowledgeable ,  helpful,   and  thorough.   They knew exactly what a person with a bad back needed.   I'll return to Ashley HomeStore for future needs.  Very nice merchandise at very reasonable prices.   Great five year service plans are a good value and cheap insurance for your investments.

Thank you,

Fred< /Review>

<Review>TAYLOR C. IS AN AMAZING SALES REP, after days and hours of looking for a couch, she helped me find the perfect fit for me.
She has so much patience and I am truly grateful for help me find the perfect piece for my home. Not only did I a buy a couch, but I will be back next week to buy a whole new bed set for my new home. I am extremely happy and she has an amazing personality.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>We got an apartment and I made an appointment to see one of Ashley's associates. When I arrived at the store I was greeted by a friendly smile on one of the employees. Her name is Agnes. She was very informative and that helped me a lot in deciding on my purchases. She also gave me helpful tips on what to check for, once the furniture were delivered and assembled. She has good taste and has an eye for great design. She's able to change how I picture the layout in each rooms without being too persuasive on her own picks. I'm still thinking about the dining set and dresser that she showed me, and how beautiful they would look with our other stuff. I may come back next week to purchase both, as long as Agnes is able to help me.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>We were immediately greeted as we crossed the threshold of the doors. William was outstanding; he made us feel good about spending money. He was on top of all my needs and totally understood my vision and wants. I loved that he was knowledgeable of all the inventory I was interested in. His customer service was great, he was very informative about the store sales and helped us save over $5,000 all while accommodating our needs also keeping quality in mind. William truly made our shopping experience seamlessly enjoyable.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<text>Horrible experience! Yes they have beautiful furniture and beautiful displays ! But no costumer service after purchasing product was not delivered on date promised it was hell to get in touch with anyone I had to go down to the Fairfield store to speak to someone about where my delivery went ! Now my furniture has little white bugs coming in and out of the dresser and guess again no one answer the phone no one ! I’ve only had this furniture for a month and I noticed it right away and no one has been able to call me back after leaving messages. I guess I’m going to have to go down there myself.
Also DO NOT buy the 5 year protection plan!! I repeat DO NoT ! It’s basically a 30 day plan because learning the hard way if your item has 2 - 5 accumulated stains it’s no longer under protection!!
Such terrible experience.< /text>< pics>

We ordered a sectional and rug. We love both of them. The three stars due to the customer service. The day of deliver for the sectional they notice that the wedge unit was missing legs. Instead of calling and giving us the option to reschedule they showed up and let us know we can accept it and wait for the legs. The driver had me talk to dispatch and they said someone should be calling me. No call. I had to call the store. No answer could only leave message. Had to call sales person cell where he help out. End up accepting the whole section with no ETA on legs. Legs got delivered four days later.  After the delivery driver left we noticed that we were missing one of the throw pillows. Called store still can't get through. Texted sale person and let him know. He said he would look into it on Tuesday or I can call the store and press 2 to get customer service. Had to call ten times before someone answered.  Three weeks later still no pillow.  Went into store to find out about pillow and because the area rug is starting to come apart. For the rug they said that they couldn't do anything because it was direct ship to us by not the store so no warranty. Completely crazy. Manager finally said he could give me half off new one. Still crazy. Finally manager said they can give me display model in exchange for defective one. If you get you furniture with no issues great. If you have issues good luck with calling customer service.</Text>

They seem busy, but Celeste I think that was her name, had managed to assist me and took my order on the bar chairs. She was very nice. I came back, since 2010, when I last visited this place. The store has so many selections, I love it, it's amazing! Well done!<//review>

Sherri Daigle was very helpful. It took me weeks to finalize my decision on a living room set I had my eyes on.  She kept me informed of upcoming sales to ensure that I get the best value.  She was was always responsive and knowledgeable  when I had questions. I never felt pressured or hounded.I felt comfortable with the furniture pieces I chose. I would buy furniture from Ashley’s furniture again.< /review>

Sherri Daigle was wonderful and friendly. She was not only knowledgeable in furniture, but confident that Ashley Furniture Store was giving the best quality and pricing than anywhere else. Her expertise won our business and we purchased several items. Thank you Sherrie for an amazing experience, you're definitely an asset to Ashley Furniture Store!</text>

<Review>The Music they play is annoying and not conducive to shopping for furniture.  It sounded like dance music and was very distracting.  It made me not want to stay long in the store.  The music does not need to be Elevator  music but it  should be light and easy and  create a comfortable relaxed atmosphere to  shop .
Also I found the manager very cold and not at all welcoming.  His first question was do you have an appointment.  How about trying..." welcome to  Ashleys and then do you have an appointment etc.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Even though I live 5 minutes from them I will never shop here again. I purchased a dining set from them about 3 weeks ago. When delivered, 3 out of the 6 chairs were wobbly and the table had a small stain. The delivery guy said he would submit a claim for someone to come back and exchange the items. I had to follow up numerous times and finally scheduled for someone to come back. NO ONE SHOWED UP! After getting no call backs I physically show up to speak to the store manager and PERRY THOMAS was awful. He was  completely unprofessional and acted indifferent towards the whole thing. Worst customer service ever. I’m going on week 3 of not having my items replaced or have chairs I can actually use. I will most definitely be following up with corporate.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Greeted us soon as we arrived by Bianca.  She truly tried to understand what I was looking for.  She also shared that any sleeper couch purchased was a saving of 50%.  That was nice I explained about the previous problem we had with a couch and she showed me how to fix.
Bianca spent a good amount of time with me as my husband had already made up his mind on the selection.  The store manager spent time talking with my husband.  Great visit we purchased couch with sleeper and a clock plus extended warranty.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80851245b8b01dd1:0x656eca8e6787e1b5</gmapID></record>

My husband’s & my experience was fabulous. This was our first time @Ashley’s.
We have been looking around for a mattress & sofa set for a long time.
Our sales rep. (Tiffany) was amazing. She has such a calm demeanor and also the effort of satisfying her customers. She had so much patience & worked with us to make it affordable & also gave us 24 months w/ no interest.
We would highly recommend purchasing from here. Customer service was highly professional. Thank you again.</Review>

We came across a bed set and a sofa set. Phil broke down everything for us. Everything from what was included and the price break down of everything. My mother had a ton of questions for Phil and he answered them all. The best part was that he was very patient with us. Never once did we felt rushed or uncomfortable. This was a great clean store and the staff there were awesome. I highly recommend this place and ask for Phil!< /Review>< rating>

She let us read & review the transaction. We really comfortable with her that’s why the entire process went smoothly. Thank you Holly for your time, we appreciate your help in finding the right items. We’ll definitely come back when we’re ready to make another purchase & we’ll be looking for you!

<Review>Our first time purchasing anything from Ashley’s Furniture store. At first we felt rushed and pressured by the first salesman, Angel. He hovered over us til we felt uncomfortable. Due to this we weren’t going to buy anything until he handed us off to another salesman, Gregg. The 5 stars is solely for the service Gregg provided us with. Gregg was a great, friendly salesman who made us feel comfortable and let us roam at our leisure. We finished the deal with him and would come back to him if we were to purchase anything else. As for their furniture, quality is better  than ikea but they have nothing in stock at this store. Everything must be shipped at your expense or picked up at a distribution center. Good luck.< /Review><Name>David Vazquez<//Name>< userid>

I located a store not far from my home....made appointment and headed out to the store. Once there i waited for Store Rep who was busy wrapping up a sale. That wait was well worth it!🤗
Divina was so warm and friendly as well as knowledgeable about the type of mattress i was looking for.
There was NEVER a feeling of "Pressure Sale" at all with her. She showed me styles of my interest and i "sample lay" in many until i found the one  i was satisfied with and fit my budget. Which was an Ashley Brand Calif King.
Divina was clear in explaining purchase and delivery process.
I'm looking forward to arrival of my new mattress.
Thanks Divina for making my shopping experience with Ashley Furniture a GREAT one!
If you are seeking a place to purchase Home Furniture...i highly recommend Ashley and ask for Divina! 🤗</text>< pictures>

We have waited two weeks for delivery today only for the drivers to refuse to take our new couch upstairs. We made it very clear when purchasing that this was going to be placed in our upstairs loft. We were assured it would not be a problem. The delivery driver Jose and his coworker suggested I get power tools, take the legs off and then have a family member carry it upstairs. Mind you I am 3 months pregnant and my husband is away for work. I paid for delivery and assembly yet they just left it in my entry way still in all the wrapping. Very disappointed with this service and plan to follow up with corporate! If they can not resolve soon, I will return the couch. Definitely not the experience I expected!</Review>< Time>

My Associate was "T.C." at the Fairfield location. Upon walking into the showroom we were greeted, and asked if we needed any assistance. Informed T.C. we had purchased a new home a few days ago.  He suggested a few items as we walked around the showroom. After an hour or so we purchased a variety of pieces for our new house. Thank you, T.C. for your time and suggestions .. Happy Customer !!<//text>

<review>Hopefully I can change my thoughts of this store later. I have never been here. My wife and I decided to get a new bed frame and TV stand for our move next week. We found some ncie piedes and they had a good sale going on. The sale was very weird tho. You can use cash or your own credit card and receive 50% off.. Your other option was to open up a credit card with them and receive 30% off. I thought this was weird. Typically you would want someone to open a credit card with you so they spend more money with you in future. It's whatever tho. It's their deal and its not why I gave a 1 star. Literally went in there at 2pm and didn't leave until 4pm..the lady helping us followed us in a circle around the whole store.. When we turned around she would act like she was doing something. When we decided what we wanted it took 1.5 hours to checkout. She automatically assumed we wanted the extended warranty of $299 and shipping of $250. These prices were outrageous.. I went on the website and it offered free shipping. So we did get her to waive shipping on TV stand. During the transaction she walked away from us 3 times for longer than 5 minutes each time without saying anything. Finally my wife went and said something to another sales person. A few minutes later the manager came to help her. She even tried to walk away from him to where he had to tell her to stay here. This is a long story but I cannot believe buying furniture is harder then handling something at the DMV.. When we got home we both somewhat regretted buying what we bought and wish we just bought the bed we saw at crate and barrel. We have great experiences with them and they always give us free shipping out of there walnut creek store. The manager was a funny guy and did make it better and we do like the stuff we bought.. It's on backorder and should be delivered in a month and a half. Next time we go if any of this happens again we are getting our of there asap.</review>< Pictures>

<review>Dealing with this was excellent .
Dealing with the delivery which still hasn't happened is another issue . No a good experience at all  .
Originally set up for June 17th was postponed on the 15th do to warehouse delivery issue . But still received info still coming on the 17th . Changed to June 21st waited 230 pm to 630 pm no show couldn't track it . No call .
Called next day shifted to the 29th of June.  Went to online chat since my numerous calls went unanswered they could had to go back to the store again they where very helpful.  If not for them I would have dropped my order . Hopefully my chair shows up on the 29th . 28 days after order .</review><gmap_id>0x80851245b8b01dd1:0x656eca8e6787e1b5</gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp><user_id>108379974579405019176</user_id><Time>1593011871182<//Time>< rate>

<text>Bill O. at the Fairfield, CA location was the very definition of customer service excellence. The words I would use to describe him and my experience are respectful, satisfied, thorough, detailed, attentive, professional, courteous, negotiable, affordable, perfect, exemplary. If he was everywhere and worked in every industry there would never be anymore consumer complaints. The single best shopping experience I have had.</text>< Pictures>

DO NOT ORDER ONLINE! Waited more than a month for a sofa delivery and when they showed up this morning it was only half of the sofa. I wasn’t informed about receiving only 1/2 so I refused it and then spent 30 mins on hold only to have a rude customer service rep answer with attitude named Mary. I was transferred back and forth multiple times being placed on hold. Customer care definitely needs some work! I’m extremely disappointed because I’ve heard so many good things about Ashley. Wish I never ordered from here and wasted my time 👎🏼</Text>

<Review>We loved the whole experience. We've bought furniture before but we've never felt this comfortable making a decision on such an important purchase. Jessy was very helpful in helping us choose and decide which sofa we wanted and what to add to it. She didn't try to push additional items, like a typical salesperson would do, to our purchase. Also, she was straightforward when it came to pricing and didn't try to hide any assembling or delivery fees which sped up the buying process! Definitely would recommend to friends and family.

My delievery was scheduled for the 15th, I am unable to reach anyone one for customer services. Once i reached a rep. (Tanish) and others they hang up in my face.  I believe this is very unprofessional. I have been calling for 10 business days. Being understnading i have left voicemail in hopes for a call back within 96 hours. No call back, I a have missed work 3 days without pay waiting for my purchase to be delieved.  because the date constantly is being changed.

I am being very understanding however, i also expect understanding to my circumstance...
This is very unfair to customers that, the customer call centers all very RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL.

I asked to speak to a manager, she also hung up in my face by saying she does not have time for this right now!

I truely expected more and i paid a lot of money for my purchase.
I would encourage you not to purchase online.<//Text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Pieces of our furniture was delivered broken and some of the art work came straight off of the walls in the store. Once again one piece of art work was damaged and filthy and the service person never told us that some of the art work was coming straight off the stores walls. I fill misled and lied too. I spent close to ten thousand dollars there thinking that I was getting new furniture.  I won't shop there ever again nor will I recommend shopping there to my friends. So disappointed .

Ashely was a great shopping experience for us.  William was a perfect salesman patient and fun.  I recommend everybody to shop there for any furniture needs you might have.  And a bonus is they made it affordable and worked with us even more because we are fire victims<//review>

We were greeted and given some current specifics about sales etc.  our salesman(Richard) was ready available to answer any questions but never pressured us or made us feel smothered as some can !  We will be going back to visit Richard for any future furniture purchases we make!  We live minutes away from an Ashley location but found it worthwhile to drive the 30 minutes  to the Concord location !  Thank you Ashley and Richard!< /review>

I had a great experience in the store with the customer service representative’s and the floor representatives, however I did not know that you cannot exchange anything once purchased items have been delivered. I feel that that is a downside of working with this company. In the future, I will definitely have to take that into consideration before making any other large purchases.</Text>

It took nearly 40 minutes to buy a $59 area rug. I have shopped at Ashley in the past and I have had similar experiences. Not as bad as this one though. We bought our first house in 1971. I had fewer papers to sign back then I did today for an area rug that was a floor sample that I knew I couldn’t return. Awful experience. That’s my last visit to Ashley. Too bad I can’t post negative stars.</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Gloria was extremely helpful and professional. It was because of my initial contact with her about a week ago which led me back into the store, instead of purchasing the same couch priced lower at a discount store. Her direct manager was very personable and reasonable as well. She did what she could to work with the numbers to come to a figure I was willing to work with, even though I paid a slightly higher price. The customer service was well worth it. I will definitely return to the store for other furniture items.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

The staff are super helpful, and the store is pretty clean and organized. Some tips for shopping here. Deliveries and returns have always been pretty easy and straight forward.
1. Always do some research first, they will price match to meet competition.
2. Don't pay sticker price, use promotions to get the best deal.
3. Always communicate with the staff, and try to haggle a deal if your on the fence about the purchase.

You should never pay full price, always look for the deals. Hope this helps!< /Review>

Watch out for their deceptive sales practices. They tell you they are having a half price sale, when all they're doing is fraudulently inflating the prices so the "sale" price, is actually just the manufacturer's suggested retail price. That is their scam. They also have the worst customer service in the industry,  by far!! Also DO NOT buy their fake leather furniture, the "leather" starts pealing and flaking off within a year.<//Text>

< review>
I came into the store with intentions of only buying a small sofa but ended up leaving with a 14 piece sectional set at a great price the sales associate that helped me out was Bailey and she was very helpful in choosing out everything to match the sectional and the furniture I already had in my apartment. I definitely recommend if you go here to ask to speak to Bailey she is very friendly and helpful. I will be returning in a week or so to pick up a small dining table set that was at an awesome price that’s how great this place is< /review>

<review>I have been calling for the last week. They no longer answer there phones. Is there a Dist.manager who can speak to this store about answering phones. I call as soon as the store opens and every 2 hours after that and still no answer. This is horrible service.< /review>< Pics>

First of all, there’s no wait time, ever. I was helped by Mr. Bill O. I originally came in just to look, but with his knowledge of all the deals, I ended up leaving with a brand new bedroom set that I absolutely love. We decided since we were about to move, we would wait to move it on moving day and he helped with that 100% by holding it for us a couple of days to pick up. When we rung the “congratulations” bell after purchase, the entire team told us “Congratulations!” They also thanked us numerous times and greeted us on the way out. I loved the hospitality, patience, friendliness, and honesty within the store !<//text>

I love the Ashley HomeStore in Fairfield/Cordelia. I’m a returning customer and both times my experience with their customer service has been an absolute pleasure. They really go above and beyond to make sure you’re happy. Especially the wonderful Miss Bianca C. there. She was so great, very patient and helpful while I spent a very long time choosing a new bedroom set, mattress, and dining room set. She listened to what I was looking for and added her much appreciated expert opinion on the different options. I’m very glad she was there to help me that day, and a couple days later when I went back in with a question. She’s the best!</text>

William was awesome from the time I walked in the door. I had picked out a sleeper sofa online and he took me right to the piece. I sat on it and was disappointed how soft it was... was looking for something firmer. He told me where to look for similar pieces. Like any product, price and quality go hand in hand. I knew I was going over my budget but William gave me the best deal possible and assured me I was buying a quality piece that would last a long time. It was a great experience all around!<//text>

<Review>I encountered a wonderful staff an sales atmosphere. I had the opportunity and privilege to be assisted by an awesome sales representative. Her name Bianca Carter. She was extremely courteous and polite. She possessed some incredible customer service skills. She listened tentatively and answered all my questions. In my opinion she should be given more hours and she should be promoted ahead of her peers. And she should be working in customer service. I would highly recommend this store to my co-workers and friends.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I'm sharing this because of the excellent service of Simon. I'm very bad at names but he is one I will remember. Besides the instant response to when I walked to the door to his almost telepathic knowledge of what I needed during my time there he was an above and beyond salesman and I hope he plans to stay there to assist me and many in our furniture needs. Thanks Simon for helping me for the sale and also picking furniture that my wife loved. You're the best!!!<//Review>< user>

Do not believe them if they say you can cancel an order even if it is less then 24 hours, if they take your money you will never get it back even if they say you will!

We placed an order in July and needed it quickly.  We were told we had to buy it and the next day they could determine the delivery date, $700 on my Ashley credit and $150 debit card. If the delivery date was too far out, they would cancel the order and we would get our money back.

WRONG!!  They called the next day with a delivery day too far out, we said cancel the order and they said no problem.  They forgot to mention we would never get our money back and would also never get the furniture.

It is now November never have received a credit after bi-weekly calls and promises.  The charge is still pending on my Ashley card and I have not been given our cash back.  I guess the next step is having to go legal methods and charge them for whatever that costs!<//text>

My absolute favorite there is Gretchen she makes things happen and keeps the place going.

We have never had a more pleasant experience with a sales person than when we purchased a leather sofa from Jessy. Jessy was extremely knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and patient with us as we were trying to decide which sofa to purchase. I would highly recommend you ask for Jessy when visiting Ashley Furniture in the Fairfield/Green Valley store.<//Review>

This is our second time purchasing furniture at Ashley in Fairfield, CA. Sherrie Hall was our sales rep this time and she does a simply fabulous, low key, no pressure job of learning what your interested in and taking you to the selection of items you might like. The store is in the process of a remodel and a bit difficult to navigate but Sherrie did the terrific job of finding us just what we wanted. Prices are fair and the quality varies to match your budget. Highly recommended!</Text>

I came here looking for Living room furniture.  I was instantly greeted by Holly and ran into her a couple times while roaming the store. She was pleasant, helpful, sweet, kind and not overbearing, A perfect blend of customer service!  The selection of furniture is amazing and nicely set up.  I found a set I fell in love with and decided to purchase.  I had Holly help me with the purchase.  She was so patient and  sweet with me as I searched for the perfect 14 piece set.  I can’t wait for my delivery but I’m sure I will be back for other furniture needs!<//review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Really disappointed, I came here looking for a bed and a TV stand. But because those arent ever bundled together, they didnt want to give me any kind of deal at all. When I conceded at a price I was unhappy with, the salesman told me my item would be delivered in 2 weeks. Which I was okay with. But 2 weeks later, I called them up and they cancelled my order and put it on back order for 3 months ahead of my purchase date. They didnt call me or even send an email telling me that it was delayed. When I called them they were rude and unhelpful in trying to figure out if they could get it to me any earlier. I spent about 2 grand here on 2 items, and dont have anything to show for it for months!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80851245b8b01dd1:0x656eca8e6787e1b5<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I purchased the Shay Bedroom set. My salesperson was Joe Herbert. He was helpful and very knowledgeable about the Shay set. He explained the benefits of having a warranty and what’s actually covered on it, which made me feel comfortable purchasing the warranty. My purchase experience was very positive and I would recommend Ashley Furniture to my friends and family.  Joe was also a great salesman.< /text><time>1517109766252</time><resp>None<//resp>< pictures>

< Review>
Was just looking for a coffee table. Simon caught me by surprise and asked if I was looking for anything else. He was able to show off the breakfast table/extras stuff that was on sale. He then put together the perfect set of dishes, rug, placemats to go with our table with stools. Me and my mom saved more money than what we spent. Good on Simon for all the help. Very polite. Would ask for Simon again if I'm back soon, which I might be. 5 stars.<//Review>

I  went to Ashley looking for a Sideboard/Buffet server . I didn't find anything that I like at the store. The salesman, William told me to look online and if I  found something they would order it for me and it would be at a 50% discount.  So, I did find a server; went back next day. William was unavailable to help me since he was with another customer.  He ask another salesperson to assist me. They [Phillip] did an awesome job in seeing that my order was complete and explained everything that would take place doing the delivery . Thanks again for the great customer service .<//Text>

<review>We’ve had our table and chairs for less than 10 months. The bench and one barstool have been broken for 3 months. They continue to say a part needs to be ordered and they’ll call me back and they never do.

<text>I visited Ashley  store in Fairfield today.   As I entered the store Jojo recognized me from my previous visit and greeted me with a big smile.  She helped me pick out the beautiful furniture for my extra bedrooms and gave me an excellent discount and her customer service was superb.  I was really impressed. For example,  she brought me a bottle of water when I complained about dry mouth and etc.  In addition, the store managers were nice too.  😄</text>< Pics>

<text>It was a decent experience. This was the second store i visited today. On the first store i never got to speak to anyone so it was nice being greeted practically at the door at Ashley. The sales rep was very helpful and insightful however i never felt pressed to buy. It was a great experience with the exception of their being some minor computer glitch causing a minor delay on the final transaction. I will probably be returning to purchase my family room furniture there after i pay off my living room furniture that i just bought today. Jojo definitely earned my business today</text>< pictures>

Just had an horrible experience with Ashley Furniture delivery. They backed their truck down our driveway which has tree branches about 9ft high and their truck is 13+ ft high. Needless to say hanging broken branches and the driveway litered with branches. Also left packing garbage on the driveway. Not professional at all. Have a complaint in and they said they would get back to me with a decision...
$199 paid for "pro delivery and set-up" 🤬

Bianca the young lady on the sales floor was exceptional. Very friendly and helpful!
The furniture seems to be good for the price.
But until the damage to the trees and mess left behind is rectified I'll have to award a very generous 2 of 5 score< /Text>

Holly and Store manager Devin were very friendly and work with me to find the best deal for what I was looking for. Great service!  The Ashley system for processing my purchase needs to be updated though. Takes too much time and is too easy to make mistakes. Holly and Devin took their time to insure everything was perfect on my very large purchase!  Thank you!< /Text>

Our personal shopping guide Jessy D. greeted us at the door, we asked her some questions and she pointed us in the right direction. She was never hovering like most sales persons but was always there if we had any questions or concerns.

<Text>Went to Ashley shopping for a Sofa. My shopping ninja niece Susan discovered something  unique about Ashley. Ashley's in store prices ( even on sale) are higher than the prices for the same item at the independent  retailers that sell Ashley. However, the on line prices are far, far lower than either. The Ashley store will price match the Ashley online price. This gives you the opportunity to touch and see what you are considering  before you buy. Gives you local delivery and the opportunity to purchase their 5 year in-home damage/spill warranty at an incredibly  low price (as it is based on the price of the purchase). Because Ashley online was clearancing  the couch we selected, our out the door price at the local Store. with taxes,delivery and warranty  was 1/3  of the in store sale price.  I am dragging  my poor niece with me everywhere I go shopping now. Delivery was on time and professional< /Text>< pictures>

We went to Ashley HomeStore after looking at many things online and decided to go in store to try things out. Holly immediately welcomed us and was very friendly and kind. While we were testing out different pieces of furniture, Holly cake by multiple times to check in and to make sure we were finding everything. Her customer service is superb! She is a great example of what you would look for in the customer service industry. Five stars to Holly!< /review>

I bought a set of leather sofa two Years ago. it started peeling off. I paid an insurance for like 300$  when I bought the sofa. When I called the insurance they refused to fix it. I went to the store a guy called Bill O Neil   told me he would help me and said just text to him the sofas picture and the receipt but I never got a feedback until
Now . I’m Very disappointed this place. Called store and they couldn’t help me ....that’s ridiculous. Never buy furniture or pay insurance in this place because they will refuse to fix it..</Text>

<Review>They charged my credit card I got through them $3850 instead of the $3500 I was actually approved for (which she knew I was approved for only $3500. But she told me it was $3850 just to get a sale) and she ruined my credit. I have emailed and called multiple times and no resolution or response.

UPDATE: I spoke with the manager of the store and he was very helpful and understanding of my situation, however still no resolution at this time.<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< userid>

<Review>Came in to just look at a bedroom set for a future purchase. Salesperson (Joe) came up us and asked us if we needed any advice. Told him we're here to just look,figure out our budget for a future purchase. He then mentioned a 50 percent discount on all items in store. My wife and I couldn't pass this up. Joe was very helpful. He allowed us to take our time browsing the store and answered all our questions. I was very satisfied with the transaction. Very good deal.</Review>< rating>

Five stars for Simon who helped us find everything we needed quickly and painlessly. Simon knew about and recommended a less expensive item which I never would have thought of myself. I will shop at this store again any time I want to buy furniture (and ask for Simon) because it saved me so much money, and time and I love everything I purchased.<//text>

The customer care and home delivery for military bases is absolutely atrocious. They’ve messed up the order multiple times. Whether it was a cracked fireplace TV set or the drivers not bringing the appropriate paperwork to deliver on base MULTIPLE times! Our stuff was supposed to be delivered on december 4th. It’s now December 19th. The estimated delivery time is also never correct. They’ve been late. Every time. Whether to let me know they couldn’t make it on base Bc of forgotten paperwork or well then not telling me at all that they couldn’t come! On top of that. They’ve never reached out to schedule a re-delivery date. We’ve always had to call them! I will never deal with Ashley’s furniture store ever again. Ever.<//text>

My wife and I decided on buying a new living room set for our house. Ashley, is down the street from us, so we went there to shop. Steven, the sales rep, greeted us and welcomed us to the store. We told him what we were looking for, and he spent an hour with us showing us many different products. We set our sights on a very nice leather set, as well as other items. Steven made it his mission to walk around with us and help us pick the 14 different items we got (they had a nice 14-items Labor Day Sale).
Working with the staff (especially Steven), was very friendly, professional and nice. Even the store manager came over and helped us with what we picked, and answered a few questions we had.
The set should be delivered in 2 weeks! We are excited for it and are looking forward to receiving the items.<//Text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>The store - clean, organized, well presented products that makes the shopping experience wonderful.

The customer service - Jessica was knowledgeable, polite, and pleasant who explained the products and the services very well.

We bought our first set of furnitures from Ashley 9 years ago and we returned to get a whole new set. We were welcomed very well by Jessica, gave us space to look around, and once we decided, she assisted us right away and answered all our questions. Even gave us a discount. We ended up buying a bedroom set, a dining set, and a sectional sofa.

Ashley is the place to go.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Bianca had excellent customer service she assisted us immediately asked us how we are doing and explained everything clearly. She also told us about the current promotions the 14Piece sets and how it works. She was friendly easy to talk to knowledgeable and experienced we felt very comfortable and delighted to do business with her. Before we came in we had a bad impression of Ashley’s Furniture and she completely changed that! If you go in I highly recommend asking for her! We will be back! 😁< /review>

I had a great experience with my salesperson, who was Jo Jo. It took me about a week to decide on a sofa and table to purchase. Jo Jo was very helpful and showed a lot of patience with me and gave me great input with the knowledge she has with all the furniture in the store and was able to answer all my questions without having to ask any other salesperson or manager. I appreciate her help and will continue to buy my furniture from Ashley.< /text>

We have been long time customers of Ashley home store in Fairfield. From couches, bed sets, tables whatever we needed we went there. However that change this year. The last 2 times we went we've had trouble with deliveries, and the very time the representative that helped us had no knowledge of anything. We bought a table and it said "next day delivery" on the sale price on the table. Nope no next day delivery available and she couldnt say why. We we're debating between 2 tables but liked the table we purchase just a little bit more so we set up delivery for 2 weeks later, that was as soon as they had. Delivery day gets here and wouldn't you know they were back ordered on 2 chairs, how would the representative that sold us the table not know the chairs were back ordered when she placed the order. Also we were never notified of that within the weeks that we waited for the table. My husband calls and the woman on the phone tells him the chairs are on the truck the delivery guy is telling my husband no the chairs are not on the truck because they are back ordered. My husband tries to pass the delivery driver the phone to speak with the woman and he refused saying "he doesnt work for Ashley's and is just delivering what's on the truck" So after about 5 minutes of my husband going back-and-forth with the two individuals the woman finally says they are on back ordered and she apologized. The delivery man nor the woman on the phone had any knowledge of when the chairs were going to be back in stock and when we would get them, again we had company over that night and we were down 2 chairs which was pretty embarrassing. I Tell my husband it's unacceptable that we paid for something yet we have no idea when we would get them, so we call them the next business day, no apologies when we called Ashley's, no trying to make it right somehow, nothing. Just an "oh yes that sucks but your chairs will be there next Friday. With American furniture galleries and other furniture companies that offer equal quality and better pricing coming back around you would think Ashelys would try and keep their loyal customers and it seemed like they couldn't care less.<//Text>

Long story short, our sales person Iyanna was awesome.

Management was pushy on the warranty.(Didn't buy)

Truck showed up on scheduled date but was missing pieces of our table...  including hardware..

The lamps sent were wrong.

Our glassware was on back order. (Set delivery 3 weeks after purchase date to insure everything arrives together... guess again..

Lastly, our bedroom set.. that was all there to end on a good note.

First and last for Ashley's.</Text>

I had the greatest experience, Lyanna was AWESOME! Ashley furniture definitely needs more workers like her. I wanted to bring her Starbucks because I felt she had patience with me and I like that she didn’t pressure me. Besides her great customer service I know she will be an outstanding candidate. It would’ve been 5 star if the company can offer a bottle of water or coffee! Thanks again Lyanna!< /Review>

I've been looking at Ashley for some furniture over the last month after several trips. I went in on Saturday to make a purchase I was very pleased with my purchase and the warranty they offered. Why I was there with my mother who also purchased a buy one get one free recliner. I'm super excited to receive my furniture in less than a week. Thank you Ashley for making my home beautiful</Review>

<review>The service is very bad . Don't buy anything on line. That is my recommendation. I got the dining table with missing parts and they left it home and I'm trying to reach them for more than a week with no reply . Very bad service</review>< Pictures>

Terrible service trying to arrange delivery. They cancel without telling you and then you have to call to try to reschedule some other time a week in the future..and it happened several times. Buy somewhere else. I cancelled my order due to their incompetence and poor communication.<//Text>

The only thing was we were disregarded by the first person when we came in and instead of helping us he just said oh yea dressers are everywhere go look around. I’m assuming because my wife and I are a young couple, but we wind up buying an entire bedroom set instead of just a dresser because of the service that was eventually provided by I believe Alyssa.< /Text>< Pictures>

As soon as we walked into the store the sales staff welcome us. The staff right away asked “what we were looking for as far as stiles in furniture” and they helped in making the selection without the pressure that you normally would get from salespeople. Ashley also offered financing at 0% as well as different discounts for 0 down or cash payout. This is the first time we bought furniture from the store and we hope to get a bedroom set on our next visit.

Bianca helped me out a great deal and I appreciate her for it.  Her and William know how to treat consumers I can’t exactly say the same for their superiors .  5 stars for Bianca & William. If I had to give the general staff a rating it’ll be a 3 so average it out to 3.5 stars overall<//Text>

I hit the jackpot on my purchase of a new sofa.  My salesperson, Karen, was the most knowledgeable and helpful sales associate I've ever encountered.  She found exactly what I needed at an extremely affordable price.  I can't say enough as to how impressed I was with her poise, knowledge and assistance.

My delivery was also spot on. I was called 2 days before to alert me to my estimated deliver time.  Day of delivery, I got a call 10 minutes before delivery, truck arrived and my couch was professionally set up in less than 10 minutes.  The sofa is of a very good quality for the price -- I look forward to many years of enjoyment with my purchase.< /Review>

The staff was very pleasant and helpful. Very nice quality furniture. Found everything I wanted to furnish an entire room and more. Will definitely come back when shopping for quality products and good service.
THIS REVIEW WAS POSTED BEFORE THE DELIVERY OF MY FURNITURE. IT HAS BEEN A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE SINCE THAT DAY!!! I SPENT ALMOST $8,000 IN THE STORE PURCHASING 33 ITEMS. 14 OF THE WERE DAMAGED OR BROKEN!!! UNACCEPTABLE!!! AFTER HOLDING FOR 35 MIN I WAS ABLE TO GET AHOLD OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY SENT SOMEONE OUT. ALL HE DID WAS TAKE PICS. I HAD ALREADY APWBT 2 HOURS TAKING PICS AND DOCUMENTING THE ITEMS THAT HAD DAMAGE.ACUSTOMER SERVICE WANTS TO REPAIR THE FURNITURE NOT REPLACE IT. THEY SENT ME REPLACEMENT PARTS SAYING THAT IF I CANNOT FIX IT MYSELF THEY  WIUcLD SEND A TECHNICIAN TO MY HOUSE.< /review>

We puchased a living room set today. Kevin Jones helped us find the perfect set to match our style. Kevin was very patient with us and listened to our needs. He showed us many options to ensure we saw all the possibilities for our space. He pointed things out I would've missed and gave us time to decide on the best option. We are very happy with our experience and will definitely return to purchase furniture for other rooms in our home.< /text>

<text>SAVE YOUR MONEY

Sherrie, Gretchen, and Jose are the only great thing about this store. They are professional, helpful, and compassionate. Far more than I can say about the management at the Fairfield Ashley.
Besides the few people listed above, we have had the WORST experience at this store. The manager (I use that term only because it’s on his name tag, and NOT because he acts the part) Perry is one of the most pompous, dismissive, unreliable people I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. We had multiple issues with the 3 deliveries we purchased through them. We were promised correspondence with Gary (the district manager). After many back and forth phone calls with the store, and Perry refusing to come to the phone, we were never able to get ahold of either men.
The issues we had with the store are far to long to type out here, and I am far too frustrated to do so. But please, if you value your money, your time, and your self worth, DONT VISIT THIS STORE.< /text>< Pics>

Had a great experience tonight with our Ashley rep Joe. He is new to the mix but extremely helpful and kind. Did not push us into anything and we are very happy with our purchase. Can't wait until our new couch arrives. Would definitely recommend and friends or family. I would definitely see Joe. He asked what we were looking for and gave us several options that fit our needs.

Overall it was a good experience. Went in to look for a couch and came out with a bed frame and a new mattress. Not disappointed however. Jojo was a great help and very sweet and although she seemed to be juggling many customers she still helped us along the whole process. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because the delivery is going to be two weeks. I was hoping to get it a little sooner.</Text>

I had a bad situation that turned out for the better.  Jenelle had contacted me, asking me had I received my items yet and how did I like them (great/old school customer service!) which at that point I hadn't yet but when I pulled up to my home I noticed that I received a package from Ashley, it was also very clear that the box was in distress so the odds of the actual product surviving was slim to none and surely once I opened the item was heavily damaged.  I was distraught due to the fact that i needed that table before my kids moved into the home.  I immediately contacted Jenelle and explained my dissatisfaction. She was extremely attentive and made me feel like a priority. She kept constant contact to keep me updated.  A few days later I spoke with customer service reps Gretchen and Alaijah as well as sales rep Bianca and they were nothing short of amazing with making sure I got my table on-time by my deadline.  I really appreciate how the staff worked together to make everything right!</Text>

Taylor helped us throughout all the process not just for a day but for three days (because we couldn’t decide). She was really patient with us. We spent almost 4 hrs working with her and that’s just for a day. She helped us pick our mattresses, made us try them and she even put a clean sheet on the bed before trying. She helped me pick out my bed set too and she was honest about the fact that the bed I originally wanted isn’t real wood, that it can wear off for some years. I am glad she told that and saved me from wasting my money. Overall, no complaints and I do really recommend her!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Excellent quality furniture, horrible, useless customer service.  Been that way for years, nothing has changed.  I called their main office in LA.  He said I called the wrong extension and will connect me to the store.  I was on hold forever.  He came back on the line every now and then to check if I was still there.  I asked what's taking so long?  He said the Fairfield store is notorious for not answering the phone.  I said why is that?  He said  "well for lack of a better word, they just suck."  THEIR OWN REP SAID THAT!  Wow, it's no secret.  I used to by my furniture from Hanks, down in San Jose.  When he passed away the store closed.  Been there for 50 years.  That was the best place to buy furniture.</review>

I called to see if a sofa was at the store and talked to a gentleman named William, he was extremely polite and let me know that they did have it there. It was on sale for 50%off so it ended up being a really great deal. William was courteous and did not pressure me to buy more items, all in all it was a very painless experience, I was in and out in no time at all with the sofa I found online at a great price!</text>

Great customer service. Joni was not to pushy when it came to sales. I expect them to offer add on products with our mattress and dining table purchase. They wouldn't be doing their job if they didn't offer. Prices were great with what we purchased.<//Review>

<Review>So far the experience has been great. We told the sales rep what we wanted, he took us to those items, and a couple that we may have considered. He explained pricing and we made our purchase. Hopefully the rest goes as smoothly!<//Review>< Rate>

Our salesman Tyler is exceptionally patient and helpful when selecting our furniture. He was able to guide us in the right direction to what style we were looking for. We highly recommend going and asking for Tyler.<//review>

Holly was amazing very sweet and patient and let me and my family take our time and make a decision with no pressure. She even let me browse some items I seen online and she helped me find them to make my final decision. Went in to browse and she was so awesome she got me to finalize on a decision. Thanks Holly I appreciate your patience with my family.< /text>

<text>My husband and I went into Ashley's looking for a couch and recliner for our new home. Holly was the first person to welcome us and helped us pick the perfect match for our living room. She was patient even when we were super indecisive. She made sure to not make us feel pressured or anything when making our purchase. Without a doubt will be back to this store for future purchases and will continue working with Holly. Everyone else who helped us was nice and professional but Holly was the best. Thank you Miss Holly.</text><gmap_id>0x80851245b8b01dd1:0x656eca8e6787e1b5< /gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures><name>katlyn goble< /name><userid>118419983129008886172</userid>< Date>

<pics>None<//pics><Review>The professionalism put towards my experience at this specific location far exceeded the numerous stores visited over the past few days.  Upon entering the staff greeted and pointed me as a customer towards my needs.  After being allowed to browse without interruption the associate began her process of indulging and pinpointing a price about a particular piece which caught my eye. Any concern or question was handled not only by the associate, but at this point the manager began getting involved in the process.  Their knowledge about what the customer needs made the purchase of quality furniture from the team seamless and comfortable. In ending after being allowed to negotiate without any eye rolling, which was experienced in a plethora of other furniture stores, it was a pleasure doing business with this particular store and sales team. Simple and top notch experience.</Review>< username>

Our experience purchasing our sectional couch from Ashley Furniture in Fairfield was very positive. Steve helped & assisted us with our purchase, instead of pressuring us. We took our time, even an additional day to compare it to another sectional we were considering from a different store. After deciding to go with Ashley's sectional, the process went very smooth. I applaud Steve for his professional & people skills to make the buying environment very comfortable and easy. Thank you for an enjoyable purchase, very pleased with it.< /review>

We worked with The Keith™️ on our visit here. Keith gave us enough space so we could make our decision in Peace™️, but was (eventually) able to be tracked down each time we needed help. We are happy with our purchase! He didn’t try to push anything extra on us that we didn’t want either. Thanks Keith S.!</review>

<Review>Great first time experience. Salesman Kevin Jones was very knowledgeable concerning my inquiry, directed/guided me.... didn't hover over me !!! and made himself available for questions. I initially was there to purchase kitchen chairs, and ended up purchasing  leather double recliner) which I had been looking to purchase for months) No hard sale   Tactics absolutely no pressure from the salesman to purchase at this time ,  I will definitely revisit Ashley furniture in Fairfield for my next purchase.

<review>Called ahead and got Krystal, told her what I wanted. I drove the hour to get there and she was not available. Talked to a gentleman about purchasing a recliner, floor model I could take home. Found one but none of the men "standing around" would assist me to carry out. Holly came by and she was willing to assist me if purchased. Krystal came back and she was willing to assist me also. Cheers to these wonderful women for helping me today.
One man, Steve, did help in the end. Krystal was my agent and she was wonderful. I will go back but request only Holly or Krystal.</review><name>John polley</name><user_id>111543114678564886921< /user_id>< Resp>

Today Ashley furniture gave us a great experience at their Fairfield store. Both our salesperson Davina and  the store mgr  made our purchasing experience smooth and easy. Customer service was top shelf and prices were very competitive. We highly recommend this Branch for anybody who's looking for any beautiful high-end furniture or decor.

I walked in the the Fairfield store today and greeted by a young lady named Bianca . She walked me through the store and the area where most of the Recliners were. I felt very comfortable while there. It is so good to walk into a store now a days with sales people that want to help a customer. I am retired now but ran Chains of retail  Jewelry stores . I also trained people how to run stores and how to treat customers. I would of loved to have a young lady like Bianca on my sales floor.</Review>

<Text>My daughter and I walked in to Ashley furniture this past Saturday afternoon to look at living room sets, and were helped immediately by Chris Velez, a very knowledgeable sales associate.   After hearing what we were looking for, Chris directed us to a couple different areas to browse, and came back to check on us a couple of times to see if we had any questions. We had narrowed our search down to one set, but we weren’t wild about the tables and lamps that came with it.  Chris informed us that we could make up our own “custom” package and that he would come up with some good pricing for that custom package.  We ended up buying a dining set as well, and also purchased an insurance plan for our new furniture. Chris  gave us some really fair pricing, helped to set up our new charge account (with 0% interest due on our three-year purchase!), and added some friendly conversation mixed in between the business transaction.

We had a wonderful experience at Ashley furniture, and Chris is definitely a valuable asset to the company. He is very knowledgeable, pleasant, and considerate; at no time did we feel any sales pressure. All in all, we would recommend him and the Fairfield  Ashley furniture to all of our friends and family. We will definitely be repeat customers!<//Text>< Pics>

Holly West greeted my son and I as soon as we walked in.  We liked that she didn't shadow us around the store, but did check in with us a couple of times.  We appreciated the way she was so courteous, yet business like.  She had great knowledge of the furniture we liked.  We came back the same day, to relook at the furniture, again making contact with Holly.  She was never pushy, we didn't come back to actually buy the furniture for another 6 days, and she remembered us, and it was like seeing an old friend.  She is definitely someone I would hire if I owned a business.< /Review>

<time>1526357727551<//time><rating>5<//rating><Review>I was looking for a couch a couple months ago and went into the Ashley Homestore in Cordelia. Divine V. assisted me during the process and was very helpful and I found and purchased a couch I love. I returned to the store today and once again Devina V assisted me and remembered me from my original visit. She assisted me in finding a recliner. She is very helpful and knowledgeable and I would return to this location because of her. Thank you Devina V :)</Review>< Pics>

<Text>I’m really pleased with the services here. I found exactly what I’ve been looking for. A three piece sectional sofa. The sales rep, Jessy was very helpful, professional, and sweet.

< Review>
If I could post a negative 5 Star review for their follow up customer service, I would! My spouse and I bought a love seat from Ashley in Fairfield, approximately 1 1/2 months ago, which was delivered by two non-English individuals. They shoved it through the door, almost breaking it. We signed for it and they left. We inspected the love seat, after they left , and a flaw was found. We contacted Ashley and a technician/repair man was scheduled. We waited 2-3 weeks for him to come out because of scheduling difficulties. When the technician came out, he  indicated that they would order replacement parts and they would fix it in our living room. When asked what that meant, he said they would undo the back of the love seat pull it apart along with the front cushion and repair it. At that moment we said "No". We felt the extent of repair to this degree was unacceptable, and to have it done in our living room was definitely unacceptable. We purchased a new love seat not a damaged one. The technician said he would make that note (replace vs repair) and we should hear from Ashley within 7-10 days. We DID NOT hear from them! We waited 3 weeks and still never heard from them. I begin to make calls only to get the run around from their customer service department. I even called their corporate office, and the customer service person there was no help. Ashley does NOT stand behind their product and we had even purchased the EXTENDED Warranty. Apparently this too, was a waste of money. If you're looking for new furniture, rethink purchasing from Ashley.< /Review>

<Text>The sales person, Holly, was very helpful and very patient with us as we  contemplated buying the sofa and love seat . She made the experience very pleasant and was truly one of the better sales people we worked with.
The sales manager in the store was very people friendly, and I think gave us a price we certainly could live with. All in all a very good experience.< /Text></record>

We are so happy to shop at Ashley Homestore at Auto Plaza  CT, Fairfield. Their customer representative, Jessica help us a lot for what we are looking for. She is very helpful, knowledgeable and very accommodating. She explained in detail everything we asked for. As a matter of fact, we are looking for a Mattress with a Headboard, Footboard, etc.. We also introduce to her Manager. Her Manager is awesome. He gives us a gift card and another discount. "WOW"...
I will recommend my friends and relatives to shop at Ashley Homestore! It's worth!</Review>

Excellent...I spoke to KO on Wednesday regarding a sofa I wanted he told me to come in although he was not working on Thursday but Ms. Holly would take good care of me.  First let me start with KO,  he was very knowledgeable about the item I was looking for, he provided me with great customer service he never rushed me off the phone and I had a million questions he took all the time I needed over the phone to get me prepared for my arrival.  Ms. Holly thank you so much such a sweet lady I knew what I wanted but there was so much to see.  She made me feel so comfortable it felt like I was shopping with a friend.  Ms Holly is truly a professional they both deserve more than 5 stars.....< /Review>

First time having own place with my family and Ashley had so many choices. Bill O welcomed us with a smile and sell discounts available plus showed us the area on which we might find wat we where looking for and we did. He helped us with setting up all the paper work and now we have our amazing kitchen table and living room 😁 Thanks Bill and Ashley furniture.</text>

DO NOT GO HERE! We purchased couches and a headboard from them in January. While the shopping experience was normal, everything that happened afterward has been a nightmare. First, they delivered the wrong couch. Which meant I had to call their warehouse, wait on hold for close to an hour to reschedule the delivery. Yes, I had to make the call. I called the store to let them know and requested a credit for the delivery fee back to my account. They said they would. Then when they delivered a broken couch. I then had to call again, waiting on hold for close to an hour, to schedule a repair. I called the store again letting them know about the broken couch, they said they would issue me a store credit on top of the credit for the delivery fee. The repair person came and said he had to order parts. Then once the parts arrived I would have to call the warehouse again to schedule the repair. It took close to two weeks to get the parts and again I called, waited the hour and made my appointment. I called the store again today to see why I haven't received my credit to the card or my store credit. The person I spoke to was very nice but wouldn't be able to help me until Saturday when the Finance Director was in. This is insane, still no credit to my card, still no store credit three months later. I have had to work so hard to get my items, countless calls and emails and no one has been able to help me. It seems to me that you should not have to work this hard to get items that you bought. I will never go back or recommend this to anyone after I use my store credit, if I ever get it, you would have better luck with Target or Walmart with much less hassle.</Text>

Very patient & helpful!
As a retired salesman of 40+ years, I like to stretch out the prosess to evaluate their demeanor. A habit after 20 years of training sales persons.
If I did not buy, I didn’t enjoy the experience, but I did buy and will buy more at Ashley going forward.
Thanks again......Carl</review>

<text>Ashley furniture in Fairfield, CA is a great place. Went there, knew what we wanted, test drove some furniture, great showroom. Our sales associate, Laura was incredible. Friendly, courtious, patient. We will purchase from them again. Only 4 stars though. They didn't have anything to drink for a thirsty customer.<//text><Response>None<//Response>< pictures>

If you need to purchase any type of furniture at this store, request for Holy West. She is very honed in customer service and works with your budget to get you the best deals. Unlike other sales associates I have met, she was interested in pleasing the client and making the purchase as seem less and easy as possible. Loved the store, but loved her the most!</Text>

If you go visit Ashely Furniture store in Cordelia you MUST see DEREK MARTINEZ!! He is the man!! He gave me the BEST customer service I’ve had at a furniture store ever !! We all know how salesman can be and sometimes we prefer on line shopping because of this. He never pressured me once. He LISTENED to MY NEEDS & WANTS and delivered me the best deal I could get. I made a suggestion in regards to the misleading information I obtained from financial services and he took it right to his manager to get clarification on how to adddress with future consumers. I was really impressed with the entire store wanting to do the right thing . I will be back to finish the last room of my house very soon. I’m super pleased and encourage you to visit this store. THANK YOU DEREK & STAFF<//text>

Staff are always prompt to greet
Prices are clearly stated and easy to understand, as far as "Manager Special" advertisement.  Several purchases and the quality is decent for daily usage.  The store is clean, and has a wide variety of furnishing to fit every household.  To date I've had no problem with my purchases.<//Text>

Holly W. was extremely pleasant and helpful. She was able to get us a sofa, loveseat, chair and a half and an ottoman quickly. The process of us finding a set to getting a delivery in the same week took less than an hour. Holly W. was a great salesperson!</text>

<name>Keyara H</name><review>We bought 3 rooms of furniture from this location. Beautiful selection, great price, and we love everything we got. However, one of the pieces to our bed frame was a bit too short. When we called to get it replaced, they had to send a technician almost a week after to look at it and order it even though we already knew exactly what piece we needed. He said the part should be delivered in about a week after that. It has been more than a week and it hasn't arrived. When I called the store to check in, the representative I spoke to was very rude and when I explained the situation, she took a long pause and said "well what do you want me to do" with a horrible attitude. She then rushed me off the phone. Without the piece, we are unable to finish putting the frame together, so we haven't been able to sleep on the bed in the almost month that we've had everything delivered. I would not recommend buying from this location unless you're okay with month long waits for deliveries and rude customer service.

Edit: The piece finally came and it was the same exact piece that was too short to begin with. We were told that the technician had to come to ensure that they ordered the correct piece. It has now been a month and, at this point, we just want to return the bed because attempting to get the right piece will only result in waiting even longer. I'm very disappointed in the lack of customer service and definitely would not recommend to anyone. In my recent phone call to the store regarding the request for a return, I was given the number to customer care and told that they would be able to help me. Upon calling, customer care told me that there's nothing that they can do and told me I had to call the store I purchased from. So now I'm being sent in circles trying to get help.<//review>< date>

From the time I entered the location until I left the building, I had the undivided attention of the staff. I never felt pressured or like I was being "handled"; even the managers were on the floor offering assistance! I'm. Lover of excellent customer service and i definitely received it at Ashley!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>We lost everything in the Atlas Peak fires. A friend who also lost their home suggested we go to Ashley in Fairfield because they treated them so well. It was everything we hoped and then some. Ronald, our sales person was wonderful, and he made sure we met Devin, the manager, who was very generous with our purchases. They were both extremely sensitive and caring. I had never considered Ashley Furnishings in the past, but based on the merchandise, pricing and quality service, they  definitely have made friends for life.</text>< date>

<userid>103995448347862760367</userid><text>I bought all my house furniture at this Ashely’s Fairfield store in March and my nightmarish journey began. Please stay away if you could. The issues with this particular store are numerous, these were my main experiences:

1. There were no sales agents available and customers were seated on the couches awaiting help. I spent about 3 hours in the store, on a 30 minute transaction.

2. They delivered a broken couch to my house and refused to take it back saying it’s store policy that a technician has to check it out first. The technician came a month later and stated I need a new couch which will take 7-10 business days to replace. I’m currently out of a functional couch.

3. It’s IMPOSSIBLE to reach the store directly via phone call. You’ll be on hold on average 15 mins and be rerouted to another location (usually in SoCal)

4. My delivery for my mattress and bed which was 3 weeks late due to back order was logged as delivered and my order was closed even though NOTHING was delivered to me! I had to call 4 different corporate numbers to get a new order made. Even corporate had problems accessing the store manager (Perry) and I had to physically leave work to go to the store and get the matter resolved.

If 0 stars is an option I would have selected it. I will never shop at this store again and I strongly recommend any consumer from doing it, once they take your money, you’re on your own. They’ll give you the corporate run around for months after purchase.<//text>< Time>

<text>Went in Saturday and talked to Karen about a table, she was very helpful and worked a good deal for me with the manager that night. Went  Home to measure to make sure the table would fit and came back the next day .   The manager the next day at first didn’t seem to want to make the same deal. Although after a brief discussion Karen and the manager of the day agreed to the deal that was made the night before. What could’ve been a disappointing problem was worked out in the end and I was satisfied with the outcome. I will go there again.<//text>< Pics>

Joe was the sales person that helped me pick out my furniture. He was really helpful and made the experience 10x better, because of his personality and made me feel like we were friends instead of a sales person. I really appreciate his kindness and I will definitely return to him for my next purchase. Thanks Joe!</review>

<Text>Where do I begin, first step into the door was, ok; opened with a joke- good,good,good. Then we got the “in training” associate, self-described. Well, let’s just say it was all downhill from here.
The associate was very deflective in regard to the wait time and very much so during the actually purchase process. During our introduction she came and went as if she was searching out a couch that we could take a look at, but of the four or five times she did this returned nothing to take a look at.
Then the real waiting game began. Ready to purchase and my fiancé and I were held up for what seemed to be about half an hour. The additional wait was due to a payment kiosk “not working” most things don’t if they aren’t powered on. Associate calls for an IT helper, who can’t figure it out either.
Hmmm...
The whole time the surge protector to the desktop computer and verfione credit card acceptor was not switched on..
I end up turning the dang machines on and finally my payment is accepted.
Oh dear baby Jesus.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Visited Ashley home furniture in Fairfield and worked with Jessie, who was amazing. She made the process if finding what I liked matching to my budget and needs. She was great and we had a great time. No pressure, no railroading just honest help. I bought a bed and a vouch with love seat. Then I went back for a dresser and end tables. Jessie was easy to work with. Professional but fun and we searched until I was happy. Great deal and great knowledge of her products. I will return again and my daughter went and bought too. I highly recommend Jessie at Fairfield Ashley Home furniture< /Text>

She has taken care of our family on many occasions of our visits to the store.

DO NOT SHOP AT THIS STORE!  I have had the WORST experience with this store.  We purchased an entertainment center, two sofas, coffee tables, two night stands, a dresser, headboard, and bed frame on May 3rd with a delivery date of June 1st.  June 1st rolls around and only the entertainment center was delivered.  They informed me the remaining items would be delivered June 7th.
Fast forward to June 7th, 2019 NO ONE SHOWS UP!  I waiting around all day no delivery came.  I went to the store and they said there was an issue with the driver.  I heard three different stories.  How can you not contact your customers letting them know there was an issue and the delivery wouldn't be arriving!
Then they said delivery would occur on June 8th, 2019.  June 8th comes and the headboard was delivered broken!  The delivery team take it back and we go down to the store to have this reorder a new headboard.  Fast forward to June 24th, 2019 and the headboard is arriving.  They show up BUT now there is no hardware to assemble the bed!!!!  Having almost been 2 months since the original order date my husband and I decide we do not want this anymore and don't want our money going to a company that has horrible customer service.  We go down The ladies that work at the back desk were AMAZING!  They did all they can to try and resolve the issue and get us our refund and return.  The manager just walked around goofing around with employees and did not come over to help.  When he finally did walk by and the employee tried stopping him to get his help his exact words were "this wasn't handled?!" and he rolled his eyes.  He of course tried getting me to keep the furniture and I told him multiple times that I do not want this furniture.  Finally after stating it literally maybe 20 times he finally realized I am serious and then he informs me that he can't authorize a return.  The regional manager has to so they call and email him but can not get a hold of him.
The next day June 25th, 2019 the regional manager Gary calls me.  He tries to get me to keep the furniture.  I once again have to say multiple times that I DO NOT WANT IT.  He then precedes to tell me four times that it will be picked up on Friday, June 28th, 2019.  I go into the store to get it all sorted out to make sure I get my refund and the manager NEVER came over to check and make sure everything was going okay.  Other employees came to check but the manager NEVER came!
Fast forward to today June 28th, 2019.  IT DOES NOT GET PICKED UP!  I wait around for the truck and when they arrive it is to deliver the headboard!  I call the store and they say the pick up is for Monday, July 1st, 2019.  WHY would they deliver an item that is already in their system as a return/refund!!!

DO NOT SHOP AT THIS STORE!  Possibly the other stores may have better customer service but the manager at this store DOES NOT!  Which is sad because Jojo, Gretchen and Aisha (I hope I spelled that right) were GREAT!  They tried everything they can to make sure they did everything they could but the manager DID NOT!  If I could give ZERO stars I would.</Text>

I already had my mind set on something before I went into the store which made my purchase here very easy. I was helped by Meelah and she was able to price match a really good price on the dining set table and chairs I was interested in. All in all I had a great experience at this location and I would shop there again.
I do have a minor suggestion, and this is in general for corporate. Making the online store completely separate from the physical stores so that your own employees cannot access any online orders of individuals who pay good money for your products is unacceptable. By doing such a thing you are impeding people who buy products online from getting the same amount of services as those who purchase online. Fix it.</text>

I want to start by saying my experience was excellent. I was worried as I walked in the door I did not get the best welcoming, however within a minute or so Steven came over and spoke with us and offered his services. He didnt push any products on me, but was very open and understanding of my budget, while being honest regarding quality. I appreciated his service and would recommend him personally.< /Text>

<text>Delivery not scheduled by the salesperson at the store according to your tracking staff when I called to check on the delivery.  It was 1 pm when I called after staying home unnecessarily.
The delivery was rescheduled and delayed 3 days for an Ashley error.
Tables delivered with several imperfections on table edges .  We could not return the one table without returning all 3 in the set. They were cheap and Managers specials for a reason. We decided to just just keep them as is.
Not happy and likely will not shop there anymore.< /text>< Date>

Our sales rep Holly West did a fabulous job of showing us all of the options for reclining chairs. She was very pleasant and put us at ease. Our chair hasn't been delivered yet, but we can hardly wait.</Text>

I've purchased four items from this Ashley furniture and have been pleased with the buying experience each time. Sales staff is attentive and easy to work with. I wouldn't buy anything here full price, but during the good sales it is perfectly reasonable.</review>

Highly recommend working with Joe as he understands the importance of customer satisfaction.

HORRIBLE! GO TO YELP AND READ REVIEWS! Worst customer service experience buying so called "top of the line furniture".They need to lower their prices if they are going to provide horrible service to people! Dont buy anything from them , if you do , better hope nothing Is wrong with it or they deliver the wrong thing.Dont bother calling customer service.You will have to physically go to the store to get any help at all. GO TO YELP AND READ REVIEWS BERFORE YOU GO THERE! I dont see how Google has them at 4.5 stars!!</Text>

<review>We just had the best experience possible. We were greeted by Lanece at the door and and she helped us until the end. She was very patient with us, very helpful and so very nice. Henry the assistant Manager came and helped me decide what would be best for my family. He answered all my questions even the crazy questions I had. All I can say and I've never written a review about a place before but I felt so good about this experience that I wanted to share and say THANK YOU to everyone there. Lanece, Henry, the ladies behind the counter, just everyone. It was truly something great and we appreciate it so very much. Thanks again.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I wish that we would have read the Yelp and Google reviews before purchasing our couch.  We have sat (Well not sat, we moved our furniture out and have an empty living room) all day waiting for a delivery.  We called the store and our item is still there.  Now they want to reschedule tomorrow.  According to all of the reviews, my husband should not take time off until the truck actually arrives.  We are headed to store now and will probably cancel our purchase.  There is no customer service left!< /text>

I went into the store thinking I wasn’t going to make a purchase but then I fell in love with a bed set! There was someone there (Ali) who was ready to help me without being pushy. She was very flexible, I changed my mind a few times and she was able to help me get exactly what I wanted. Can’t wait to get my bed set!!< /Review>

I would never recommend shopping here or purchasing from Ashley. The couch we purchased was so uncomfortable we had to return it. The return process took 2x as long as it should, the drivers didn't show up for the first scheduled pick up (no call or notice that they had changed the dates). Buy from somewhere that will be less of a headache.< /Text>

<Text>Josephine was a huge help! She had tons of patience while my husband and I (and our 3 year old and 2 year old) shopped for a new mattress. I felt super comfortable here and didn't feel pressured to buy anything I didn't want to. Would totally recommend anyone to buy their home furnishings here.< /Text>< gmapID>

<rating>5<//rating><text>While shopping at Ashley Furniture Store in Fairfield Ca, A young lady who went by the name of Jo-Jo kindly gave me a tour of the store, then guided me to the area of my interest. Jo-Jo also showed me other options which I was pleased with. She also showed me the rugs section. Her options of rugs were with great taste. Afterwards I made my decision and completed my purchase. Jo-Jo has great hospitality and very enjoyable.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Went to buy furniture yesterday and had the best experience  when I first walked in  I was expecting to be approached by sales associates trying to get me to buy but I wasn’t I was acknowledged  when I came in  the door and was left to do by looking around and when I had a question I went to one of the associates it was Steve Lassen He was so helpful and so nice and not pushy at all and when I finally made my purchase I got so much for the money that I spent great sale  Steve had knowledge of their products and it was just a great experience Thank you Steve<//text>

If I could I would give no stars.  The first time they said they would deliver my loveseat, no one came ( 4 hour window ). No one called to tell me they weren't coming. I had to call them. They said it didn't make it on the truck. The next time they called me 10 minutes before the delivery time was supposed to start. It was still on back order. I'll see if three times is the charm.< /review>

<Review>Great service. We were greeted at the door and Holly took us right to the item we were looking for. It was a sale item and we had to make a decision fast due to the fact that they were almost out of the item. The store had a lot of items there bit we went for just this one piece of furniture.</Review>< response>

The salesperson Sherrie Hall was very, very helpful
I appreciated her warm welcoming spirir , her infectious positive attitude and how she worked very hard to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase and that she was not just trying to make a sale. I felt she was genuine. The guy who assisted her was also very helpful. Overall I had a good experinence I will definately be going back.<//Text>

William Ross is an amazing sales man. He really worked with my husband and I and took his time. I felt welcomed and even though I didnt buy the super high end stuff he didnt make me feel less than. If you are thinking about buying anything from this store, I would see William!< /Review>

Absolutely awesome experience in our interaction with JoJo in the Cordelia store. She is a top of the line sales person and representative for Ashley Furniture. They are very blessed to have her. She is very knowledgeable and helpful in every single facet of her job. We went in to purchase a couch. We left after a purchase of a complete living room, bedroom, and dining room set. Not to mention some accessories to go with them. We will definitely refer all of our friends and family to Ashley and have them ask for JoJo💕< /Review>

I'm in Sales , so I'm very turned off by "high pressure" sales people . This particular store was AWESOME to deal with !! From the beginning to the end , I never felt pressured and was thrilled to work with the professional people in the store , they were accommodating , sincere, honest , and willing to deal with me . Got to meet the District Manager that day and also the General Manager Devin .. both ( in my opinion) were the bomb !! They went above and beyond to get my daughter the bedroom set she was set on getting at a great price .. thank you to ALL of the employees at this Ashley's in Fairfield.. I would highly recommend this store to anyone wanting to buy home furnishings.. you won't regret visiting this store .. great stuff and excellent service .. even to the delivery guys who had to put up with me moving the furniture around ..and not complain .. all I can say is AWESOME!!!!!</review><rate>5< /rate><pictures>None< /pictures>< userid>

<Text>Typical furnature store has a wide selection of items and prices.  Sales people were definitely above average in that they checked in and then left me alone.  No constantly asking me if I needed help.  Furniture is not Eathan Allen level but decent low mid range.<//Text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
We purchased a sofa, loveseat, tables etc. including the protection plan approximate 1 year ago.
A seam is separating in the sofa due to defective workmanship.  I contacted Ashley’s and they stated that is not covered in the warranty.  Kinda funny because when we bought the 5 year warranty we were told that it covered everything including burns, tears etc.
In other words if I cut the sofa with a knife or burned it they would fix it.  However, they do not fix defective workmanship including seams coming apart.
Do yourself a favor and shop at an honest, reputable furniture store, not Ashley’s.

<text>They have a good selection of furniture but I think most of their things are over priced as I found the same exact things somewhere else for cheaper. Their costumer service sucks , I ordered a lot of furniture from them to furnish my new home. They ended up not shipping a few things and when I called it was hard for me to actually talk to someone to help me. So I had to physically go there to get it resolved. Come to find some of my items were not available till months months later. I actually had to go there a few times because they would send some things but miss other things. And the people trying to figure out why it wasn't sent have really no idea what they're doing And it takes long for them to figure out what went wrong. It was more of a hassle than anything. I just gave up on a painting for my daughters room that never came. It came in a furniture package and it was more of a headache to keep dealing with them and trying to argue for it ,  I just let that item slide. About exactly a year later the item arrives. A whole year! lol and also I think they had also sent a wrong item. This place is so dis organized. I wouldn't recommend this place , save yourself the headache and trouble.</text>< time>

Worst place to buy furniture, we bought a sofa and love seat and a recliner in less than a year it's falling apart and braking down. We will never buy anything there again and we are telling all our family and all our friend's not to go there.<//Text>

<text>We had a great experience with Ashley furniture in Fairfield. We purchased a new living room set and dinning set, which included area rugs and multiple accessories. Our sales representative, Divina, was extremely helpful. She was so patient with us as we took HOURS to figure out what we wanted and she helped us every step of the way. She was able to answer all our questions throughout the entire process. She must have walked that showroom with us over 10 times, and she never made us feel like we were taking too long, and like I said we were there for HOURS!!< /text></record>

I just moved to Fairfield, stopped at Ashley Furniture to shop for my new apartment needs.  Was greeted by a beautiful young smiling, friendly professional named JoJo.  Within a few minutes I picked out a dining room set. Jojo was very helpful letting me know earliest delivery dates on my choice items that was very important to me.  Next I chose a bedroom set for my son. Very happy with my choices, thought I was done for the day.  I received a great deal on my purchases "Managers Specials".  As I walked out the door, I saw a beautiful media center with a heater and light effects.  I fell in love with it and went back to Jojo to purchase it.  By that time the Ashley Store Manager, wonderfully talented Perry Thomas came to approve the discounts.  He asked me about my furniture needs, I was tired and confused.  Within a few minutes these interior design professionals JoJo and Perry walked me through choosing a sectional set I absolutely love.  The set came with tables lamps and pillows.  I was in awe of the energy and willingness to help me find just the right extra pieces I needed to create the home of my dreams.  Thank you Soo much Ashley Furniture..
The next day I brought back my son after purchasing two bedroom sets living roor and dining sets plus art and rugs.  My son wanted to upgrade his bed to a nicer one.  We also swapped out the dining set and the rug and art and clock.  Talk about work.  JoJo and Perry tirelessly helped us with our new furniture ideas without hesitation.  They both took their time and expertise to select the right lamps that matched my son's new bedroom set.  Was so much fun and I can't say enough about Perry Thomas and my girl JoJo who cut my purchase prices in half with discounts.  JoJo even texted me on her time off to update me on delivery of my 40 items.  Delivery for my first items is tomorrow.  The rest next Sunday.  Can't wait for my lovely new furniture.  Couldn't have done it without JoJo and Mr. Perry Thomas come to find out was interior designer at Restoration Hardware.  How lucky are we to have him at our fingertips.  I am Soo happy.  Thank you.

< Review>
Horrible management aka Perry Thomas!

On 12/23/18 I purchased just over $2700 from the Ashley's Furniture Store in Fairfield Ca. Where I payed in full and in cash. That day I scheduled a delivery for 2/15/19. About a week and a half before my delivery date I called the customer care number to push back my delivery to 2/23/19 since the remolding of both  my bathrooms & new flooring weren't completed. On 2/13/19 I get a text saying I need to confirm my confirmation of delivery for the 2/15/19 or else my furniture won't be placed on the truck. Well, why would it? I had called a week & a half earlier to change the delivery date. When I called customer care back they stated that, that wasn't done but they could reschedule then. So she rescheduled for 2/23/19. On 2/21/19 I received another text stating I needed to confirm delivery for 2/23/19 or call customer care to reschedule. I had to call customer care because my bathrooms we're now completed but the flooring was still unfinished. So, I pushed it back to 3/13/19. On 3/11/19 I should of received a text saying I needed to confirm delivery but I received nothing. I called that night after I got off work but they we're already closed. I called the next day only to find out there was no delivery set up for the 13th. A day in which I took off of work in order to be home so I could receive my furniture. As I'm speaking to the rep she goes on to say the reason there's no delivery set up because my bedroom set is on back order. How is my furniture set on back order when I bought it back in Dec & they told me it wouldn't be any longer than 3 weeks from the purchase date. Plus, two other delivery that we're scheduled prior to this one they were confirming my orders. So, ur basically telling me you sold my furniture. Then she wants to tell me she can schedule me for the 3/19 several times. I kept telling her no because I work during the week and every other weekend. I requested this particular day off. I'm not using another vaca day cause of there screw up. She said, she would call the dispatch to see if my stuff could be put on the truck since it was coming in later that day. Comes back on the line to say I was gonna get my stuff that she'll send me a confirmation & they we're sending an email to Perry Thomas the store manager & he should respond to me when the store opens at 10am. Never received a confirmation or a call. Called customer care once again after I got off work to see what was going on with my delivery and the girl tells me I'm scheduled for the 3/19, when I specifically told the other girl not to schedule me for that day multiple times and she did anyways. By this point I was so irritated with the customer service from Ashley's I drove over to the store and asked to speak with the manager Perry Thomas who did NOTHING. He didn't apologize, he didn't even listen to all of my concerns, he just passed me off to a representative in the store who was new. While dealing with her she goes on to say that more of my items are back ordered. What did Mr. Thomas do about it? NOTHING, stood there standing around or looking at his phone. So, he passed me off for what reason cause it wasn't to help another customer. That's not how you run a store and that's definitely not how you do customer service especially when you have a customer paying cash and who planned on buying a living room and kitchen set as well. He's one of the worst manager i've ever come across. I definitely wouldn't go back to the Ashley's in FF as long as he's there. Especially because he had everyone else doing his job for him. Needless to say I returned the next day to ask for my money back & told them they could  keep there furniture. I will say Gretchen the CSR is wonderful. She's very helpful and did everything she could to try and correct the situation but by that point it was far to late for me. Bill O. was the one who helped me out when I first bought the furniture & very knowledgeable and had great customer service!!!! Those two are far to good to be working under management like Perry Thomas.< /Review>

I walked into the store today, and walked around for 20 minutes before someone offered any help.  I was finally greeted by a female staff member that was courteous, we explained to her that we were serious about buying multiple items, and she walked myself and my wife over to the kitchen table section. She explained to us that she would return to check on us in 10 mins, 30 mins later me and my wife were still waiting for help, long story short we walked out after poor service, and will end up spending thousands of dollars elsewhere.<//Review>

Chris is the sales representative from the Fairfield location whom assisted me with my purchase. He was knowledgeable and he cared about what we wanted. He helped exsucute the sale and made sure every detail was correct. I'm pleased with the service I received and from this point on he is the only sales representative I will deal with besides the manager. Thank you Chris,</Text>

<Name>nikkienick1<//Name><date>1475425822481< /date><rate>1</rate><review>I order a single sofa and a kitchen table. Ashley's sends 2 idiots over for delivery. They did not try very hard to get the sofa in the living room. They decide it won't fit and the can't do it (keep in mind I have a full sectional in my family room and used the same entry). They take the sofa back and I call to request a refund. Ashley's had 3 different people call me and try to reschedule the delivery for the same sofa. I explained 3 different times that I want a refund. The final phone call I was told since you paid cash it will take 25 days for us to send you a check in the mail we don't keep cash in our stores. Horrible experience and I will not ever purchase from them again. They offer good quality furniture with poor quality delivery guys.</review>< pics>

Recent just move so I needed furniture for my whole apt. I been looking online and around town at pieces which I found my daughter bedroom set and livingroom items at a different stores but still havent found the perfect couch so I went into Ashley's just for that. My sale rep was Baylie, not only was she friendly and funny she really took the time to listen and understood what I was looking for she was GREAT!! Because of her AMAZING customer services I brought not only my couch, but my daughter bedroom set and furniture for the livingroom too at Ashley's and I will definitely be back to buy my bedroom set when my other furniture get here!!  Definitely ask for BAYLIE when you get there!!<//Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>Went in to buy a coffee table that was $300 with tax.  For all their furniture you cannot pick it up at store.  Would have to go to Oakland and pick up myself to avoid the $100 delivery charge (yes a third of the price of the item).  That will be our last visit to any Ashley Furniture store.  No such issues at other places where we have recently bought furniture.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I call every week for an update. What a waste of time. Avoid this place at all costs. Never had worse customer service. I even made the mistake of buying the useless 5 year warranty.<//Review>< Pics>

They make seem so that u buy a bunch of stuff but their deleivery service is awful because I had purchased three dressers. And it took them threee weeks  to deliver then. I was in the phone every day.  I was told that they would be delivered in a week.  Don’t go here and don’t buy from here<//review>

<Review>I went to the Fairfield location, and was immediately welcomed by Holly :) Coming from an Apparel Marketig & Design background- I already had s specific vision and color palette in mind.  My vision is Boho Princess Chic, and I wanted a metallic finish.  I was delightfully surprised with the options she showed me- it was on point with my vision.  I ended up leaving with a whole bedroom set. Holly went above and beyond my expectations, and is very knowledgeable with the products.  I definitely recommend Holly for anyone going to this location.  Thank you Holly and team for such stellar service.< /Review>< name>

< Review>
I was super excited when I went to Ashley's furniture the staff was awesome. What happened afterward was a disaster! I was told the furniture would arrive in six to eight weeks it arrived in one. It was missing parts, scratched, and the doors don't close right on my night stand or dresser. For the money I paid it was not at all what I was expecting. When I called no one would answer and no one would resolve my issue I tried being as nice as possible and was ignored. I lost a hole day of work, slept on the floor without a mattress, and the surprise that I had for my fiancee was ruined. Sadly I am very disappointed with the after service.<//Review>

<Review>Your system is broken. I was told I would receive my recliners on New Year’sDay. I question that date twice. The salesman said yes and they couldn’t give me a time. so I waited at home all day. I called and they said they were closed New Year’s Day. They gave me a supervisor. She said it would be delivered that Thursday the 3rd and I would get a call Wednesday the 2nd. I did not receive a call Wednesday. So I waited Thursday and finally called. They said it would be Tuesday the 8th I called today and they said one of the recliners was back ordered until the 13th and delivery would be the 15th. I understand things happen. I should have received a call for the delay. I should have received that call three times. When asked by family and friends I will have to say you have the worst service ever. This is the second time I have written on this web site. Not even a call back.</Review>< Pics>

Last week my mom and I went in to Ashley Furniture in Fairfield and were greeted by Melah. From beginning to end, she provided amazing customer and was very kind, honest and genuine. They were willing to price match, and the manager offered us a great deal on the 5 year protection plan - something we would normally not purchase. The man who helped us load our chairs in the car was also very kind and helpful. Overall, I can't express enough how great of an experience we had there. I am so thankful for the team of great people we got to work with that day! I look forward to making future purchases at that store.<//Text>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>Although out sales person was farley new on the job,he was very pleasant, and a gentleman.  He answered all our questions and if he did not have an answer ,obtained the answer quickly.
My only complaint was when I called the store to make a change, I was put on hold for 15 minutes ,with no explanation from anyone.  I hung up  tried again same thing hung up after 10 minutes.  They called it CUSTOMER service NOT.  IF THEY TOOK MY NUMBER AND SAID SOMEONE WOULD CALL BACK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CUSTOMER SERVICE.</Text>< pictures>

The sales staff are also very good.  Ron and Jemellah are both kind and fun to work with.  Thank you all for your excellent service and attention during our time of shopping with Ashley Furniture.  Will definitely shop here again!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Bill ONeal came by and showed me a set that I was impressed by after he showed me the studiness of this piece of furniture. The overall style and size was also what I was impressed with. Bill's overall knowedge and presentation also impressed me. He gave me a fair deal on the unit when it came down to the bottom line. Thanks Bill, for your time and professionalism.

Some things were destined to be together, such as peanut butter and jelly or the hard riffs of Tony Iommi paired with highly intoxicated vocals of Ozzy Osbourne. As fate would have it two more things came together in splendor that could only be conveyed through leather bound epics in the halls of Rivendale. As I traversed the boundless endtables and ottomans that fill a stadium sized warehouse known as Ashley Homestore, my gaze landed on a sight so glorious it could make a zealot out of the most stringent of non believers. The plush oversized cushions drew me in like Gollum it’s precious, and I crumbled onto it’s all encompassing embrace. Moments later my attention, for what it was worth, was drawn to a man with impeccable dress and pleasant demeanor. He talked extensively about quality of craftsmanship and value retention of such a magnificent piece of furniture. He called himself T.C. But from that day forth I shall call him brother. Money spent that day pales in comparison to the wealth this couch will give me in its life and mine.</Review>

<Review>William was absolutely lovely to work with no frustration when I change my mind literally five times and gave me the same customer service each time when I only walk that with one item instead of the set that I intended to.

Questions were quickly answered and suggestions were offered on products. Thanks Ashley team!  Special recognition for Chris Veles and Jamilah!  Excellent staff!< /review>< Resp>

<Text>My dining table arrived scratched, two chairs came out defected and the delivery guy was rushing me to sign the paper because he was in a hurry to go. But, I guess it's my fault for being too much of a nice guy and trusting them. Lesson learned and i'm never buying from Ashley Furniture HomeStore again.<//Text><user_name>A J</user_name><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<review>Bought a temperpedic and the a 14 piece living room set. The furnature and mattress seem to be very be very comfortable. The problem is mis advertising on the product. The set only came with 13 pieces and the reclining chair in the show room was not included in the set. They offered to throw in a throw as the 14th piece but who needs another dog blanket.

Customer service hung up on us a total of four times and we waited five hours for in the store total. I would not recommend Ashley furnature to my worst enemy.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Chris Vélez was wonderful and very helpful young man. If you guys need any furniture go to Ashley furniture in Fairfield and ask for him. He speaks Spanish also which was a plus. Thank you Ashley furniture and thank you Chris Velez.< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>Would have loved to be writing a positive review of how much I loved my furniture, but sadly this isn’t the case. Derek and the regional manager were very nice. I felt slightly pressured to buy that day to get the best deal. I probably should have just said no and waited, but I really loved the pieces. When we were towards the end I asked them ( not anyone else) about a mattress protector. I was thinking I might get a cheap one thrown in because I had also bought a matress. The one they brought out was $119.00. I thought that was pretty pricey but decided to add it to my stuff. My receipt said full price for it and the regional manager didn’t say I was getting a discount. I will say they did discount other stuff and discounted a piece of the furniture to make the protection plan cheaper, but never was if communicated I was getting a deal on the matress protector, because I wasn’t. When I got home I immediately regretted purchasing it. It was for my daughters bed and I felt that was just too expensive. I had spent over $5000 in new furniture. I paid full price for the matress protector I can surely return it..... wrong. I called less then 24 hours and was place on hold for nearly ten minutes trying to find out about the return. The customer rep went back and forth with the manager saying it was worked into my deal. I told her that was 100% false. Then placed on hold again while she talked again to her manager just to argue that I couldn’t return it. I don’t even know if that’s legal? I mean I had the receipt and that I paid full price. Anywhere else I can think of would have taken it back no questions asked. It was unopened as well. It literally was gone for 20 hours from the store. I also thought it was poor customer service the manager couldn’t jump on the line instead of placing me on hold several times to relay the message.  I tried for the rest of the day to just shake it off, but I felt not great about my purchase now. I’m a single mother and work very hard for my money. It was my first huge purchase since losing all my furniture to the lake county valley fire two years ago. I wanted it to feel special and sadly that was all taken from me. I went ahead and cancelled the purchase and brought the matress protector back. They did the cancellation quickly as if it was whatever to them. I thought bringing it to the store the manager might change his mind, but he didn’t come to speak with me. I felt like I was just a dime a dozen. 5000 grand just must be chump change to them. I am still in shock it was over $119.00. Seems just so petty by them. I wish I could have just returned it and gotten my furniture tomorrow. Will go with a small local company instead.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<text>I usually don't write reviews but this one instance was my disappointing experience with Ashley Furniture in Emeryville California.  I purchased about $4500 worth of furniture.  The delivery came a month later. When they brought the furniture they realized that they were missing out one leg of the dinning table. So that evening I had invited some friends over for dinner, haha dinner and no dinning table. So upon delivery I was told that I will receive the missing table leg the next day. Next day came and gone,  no call no show. Third day I called the Emeryville store to speak to the manager.  I was told by the rep that the manager will call me since he was busy.  Manager never called. Forth day I went to a different Ashley Furniture store to ask for a refund. By this time a had also contacted the company to direct me to the corporate office. The response I got from the corporate office was to call that 800 number.  I called the 800 number and it went to a weight loss program.  Very frustrated, I went to another Ashley Furniture store and the manager at Fairfield Ashley Furniture store was kind enough to resolve this situation.  After all this hassle and frustration I don't think I will ever shop at Ashley Furniture.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

UPDATE: JACKELYNE sent me a very inappropriate and harassing email regarding this HONEST review of my experience with the store. She was extremely confrontational and the email crossed the line! Original review: Double charged my bank account and told me it would be 5-7 business days to refund the second charge!!!! Disrespectful female on the phone continued to call me "hun" after i asked several times to stop calling me that and to get a manager on the phone and she just laughed and said "ok hun just a moment". Disgusting behavior from a customer service "manager". Im now short $2600 for a week. DO NOT PAY w DEBIT GO GET CASH!!! Biggest mistake shopping here!!!</text>

I have purchased from Ashleys furniture in the past with not having the best experience. I thought i would give the fairifled store a shot since they have always had a  big slection of furniture. We met Ron our sales associate. Ron is an amazing salesman. He knows his products and knows what's right for his customers. We came in for a new bedroom set and sofa for the living room. Ron found us the perfect set and talked to us about our mattress. We went through a tempur pedic demonstration and we found out what an amazing bed tempur pedic was. We didn't come for a mattress but he gave us such a great deal we couldn't pass it up. Buying the bed was life changing. Having a great nights sleep is priceless. Thank you again Ron.< /Review>

<text>Horrible customer service. Bought our sectional in late January of this year. It arrived in February and was wrong. They argued with me that it was what I ordered. After numerous phone calls they agreed to order the correct piece and have it delivered at no charge to me. Now every time you call the guy who has to deal with it is never there. The couch is already broke and I will never buy another thing from them.< /text></record>

As I driving home I saw an Ashley Homestore I was like hmmm...let's give one last shot....walked into the store to plethora of furnishing options and was hopeful but unfortunately when I first walked in-two associates looked me in my face and neither uttered the word "welcome to Ashley Homestore..." I wasn't sure if this was going to be a great experience...BUT thank goodness Bianca from coming onto the floor and changed my customer experience...She took her time and explained all the functions of each chair and made sure we found and purchased exactly what my mom wanted...if you ever visit this store and want a professional customer service experience ask for BIANCA!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80851245b8b01dd1:0x656eca8e6787e1b5< /GmapID></record>

< Review>
We came in to get a dining room table and I left with nothing. The sales person Daisy was well dressed polite as we walked in but was of no help. She said "our tables are everywhere" at one point she was sitting on the waterfall thimg picking at her teeth!!! When we found one we liked and sat down with her and she then tells me only four chairs come with the table now it wouldn't have been such a surprise if she had walked with us and told us that. As I told her I needed to talk to my husband who was in the restroom she was on her phone texting. We walked out and she didn't even notice. Horrible customer service.</Review>

This is the most unorganized furniture store ever. I can't even describe how ridiculous it is what we had to go through. I just have no words. They schedule an appointment, you stay home all day, nobody's coming, you call them and they have no idea about what you're talking about. You schedule appointments over and over for the same piece of furniture and it all starts over again. The funny part is I still don't have my delivery. I am so angry I can only laugh about this. HUGE COMPLAINS, HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.

PS The quality is only a little better than ikea to be honest. I can't even...< /text>

<Text>My husband and I purchased an Ashley California King Mattress Item#71251 by Miss Jamielah. For someone "New" she was professional.  Her attire, her presentation, and her drive to find out the answers. We also purchasedthe Temp Cloud Breeze pillow for me; specifically for my menopause.

Miss Jamielah is an Ashley WINNER!!!! Kevin was also a great help.

If you're looking for a mattress,  ask for Miss Jamielah<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Please I am begging you please DO NOT! Buy any furniture from this store. Once you finally recieve the furniture the customer service goes out the door. I have been cursed out by management, threaten by delivery dispatcher, and when I called to get in touch with a regional manager I left all my info and received no call back. I see why I found so many bad reviews on youtube about this company, please if you want to stay in a marriage if you want to keep your relationship DO NOT buy ANYTHING from this store. My experience was really terrible so bad and many others just Google them and search youtube reviews I was treated very poorly. There are so many other furniture stores out there I wouldn't recommend them if they were the last furniture store on earth. Save your money, blood pressure, stress, tears etc for another moment that is actually worth going through all that.<//text>< pics>

My experience was great and all. I wouldhave honestly given it a five stars but the fact that i had to order my other furniture seprtly and then one of the drors was put on wrong by one of the set guys and when i opened it, it became apart and is pretty much useless from the part you slid the dror in. Very disappointed<//text>

<Review>We bought a  couch and one of the pices was damaged, the delivery guys send a message to the store  and told me that we should get a new pice with in a week so we waited for 3 weeks  and nothing happened so we went to the store and let them know that we needed an exchange for that particular pice and they send a new one but they charge us for it $371 I keep on calling them to get my bill fix but they said it's only the delivery charge..This is at the Fairfield store, So don't go there.</Review><Response>None<//Response><rating>1<//rating><Name>Mary Caro< /Name><date>1503882057720<//date></record>

Seems every time we browse at Ashley furniture we are followed around like shoplifters.  Can't quite understand that but we are never allowed to just browse and have a private conversation about whatever item we are interested in.  The sales staff just hounds us until we leave.  No more going to Ashley furniture for us.  They are rude.</Text>

<Text>I ordered from Ashley Store in Fairfield, ca. on April 10th 2016, and it's been over 3 week with 4 reschedule appointments... I have received not one piece of furniture, but I have a bill for $3,500.00 Plus dollars... I was told the mattress and ergonomical bottom was sold to another customer and I would have to pay cash else where and take a  $1700.00 plus refund... I have taken off from my business several times to be told... it's on back order... I will never order from Ashley Furniture Store in Fairfield, Ca. Ever again...I don't have everyday to sit at home and wait for delivery...</Text><rating>1< /rating>< resp>

Horrible experience.  Furniture arrived damaged... even after 3rd exchange. The manager at the Fairfield store offered to credit our account $100 because the 3rd ottoman was damaged as well. Just got tired of the "tech repair" visits. Never happened. Now when I call they just put me on hold until I give up. Never Again.<//text>

<Review>No one greets. No one helps you. Very unorganized. You can't even tell who works there or who is the customer. Worst furniture store we've been to. Rather go to a private owned furniture store and do business there.< /Review>< gmap_id>

< Review>
HORRIBLE delivery service...ghetto-ass warehouse in Oakland waited 10 minutes before my confirmed and scheduled delivery time on the day of the delivery they don't have my sofa that it was out of stock.  I went to the store and it showed over 17 sofas on-hand!  Freaking horrible....FIRE them all!!!< /Review>

Had to  wait over three months for our couch. We paid in full up front.  No costumer service. No go reason why our couch was not built. They kept trying to get me to pick on other set, I said, no I want what I chose and I am not changing my mind.</text>

A big shout out to Joselyn who was super patient and incredibly helpful , she helped me think about putting different pieces together and never made me feel rushed! Ashley’s is a nice store to begin with, but Joselyn made the experience fun. It made for a very nice expo. I went home happy.< /review>

I went with my husband to the store in fairfield in mid-September and bought a dinning set, the shipment was for Sep 21 for which my husband and I took the day off. When they arrive we see that they only brought the chairs and not the table, according to them, someone called me and I agreed that they would leave only the chairs without the table, which is totally a lie. As we did not receive them, I was calling to find another fast shipping date and they gave it to me until October 12, I accepted with the frustration that I had no dinning for my family.
Oct 12 arrives which I asked again for the day off. The table arrives and it was totally broken, my frustration and anger was so great that I decided to accept the chairs only, which I checked and I did not see anything broken, my husband arrives in the afternoon and turns the chairs upside down and two of They had broken legs and the other had a stain, we immediately went to the store and asked to speak to the manager (a hairless man not very nice) I explained my problem and demanded that he please cancel my entire order because it was so much my frustration and such poor customer service that I did not want to continue dealing with the store. To all this he told me that they could not cancel it because I had already accepted the chairs, so I had to reveal myself and mention that I was going to sue them. The manager dares to tell me that out of courtesy he was going to try to approve the cancellation but that he did not assure me anything ... very angry I returned to my house to wait for the call that they would make me in 7 days, they never called me and then obviously I had to call and They tell me that my case was approved and that on October 25 they would pick up the chairs and give me my refund ...
I asked for the day off for the third time and on October 25 and I see that they are bringing the table again and there is no order to pick up the bad chairs that they left me, and if they take them without an order, it is most likely that They will charge me, I still have the chairs in my garage and my husband is dealing with this situation that I do not know where it will end .....
I have never in my life shopped at that store again with such poor quality and worst customer service.

para todos los clientes de ashley furniture, quiero expresar mi horrible experiencia. yo fui con mi esposo a la tienda en fairfield a mediados de septiembre y compre un dinning set, el envio era para sep 21 por el cual mi esposo y yo tomamos el dia off. cuando llegan vemos que solo traian las sillas y no la mesa, segun ellos, alguien me llamo y yo estube de acuerdo con que dejaran solo las sillas sin la mesa,cosa que es totalmente mentira. como no las recibimos estube llamando para buscar otra fecha de envio rapido y me lo dieron hasta oct 12, acepte con la frustration que no tenia dinning para mi familia.
llega oct 12 lo cual volvi a pedir el dia de trabajo libre. llega la mesa y estaba totalmente quebrada, mi frustracion y enojo era tan grande que decidi aceptar las sillas solamente, el cual las cheque  y no vi nada quebrado, llega mi esposo en la tarde y le da vuelta boca abajo a las sillas y dos de ellas tenian las patas quebradas y la otra tenia una mancha, de inmediato nos dirigimos a la tienda y pedi hablar con el manager (un señor pelon no muy agradable) le expuse mi problema y le exigi que por favor cancelara toda mi orden porque era tanta mi frustracion y tan mal servicio al clente que no queria seguir lidiando con la tienda. a todo esto me dijo que no podian cancelarla porque yo ya habia aceptado las sillas, entonces me tuve que revelar y mencionarles que los iba a demandar. el manager se atreve a decirme que por cortesia iba a intentar aprobarme la cancelacion pero que no me aseguraba nada... muy enojada regrese para mi casa a esperar la llamada que me harian en 7 dias, nunca me llamaron y pues obvio toco llamar y me dicen que mi caso estaba aprovado y que en oct 25 recogerian las sillas y me darian mi reembolso...
volvi a pedir el dia libre por tercera ves y en oct 25 y veo q  estan trayendo la mesa de nuevo y no existe ninguna order de recoger las sillas malas que me dejaron, y si se las llevan sin una orden lo mas probable es que me las cobrarán a mi, aun sigo con las sillas en mi garage y mi esposo esta lidiando con esta situacion que no se en q va a parar.....
nunca en mi vida vuelvo a comprar en esa tienda con tan mala calidad y con el peor servicio al cliente.</review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) The workers are kind but I was going to buy a mattress of 1349 and they raised me up to 2300 for the delivery they charge you so expensive they exceed the prices they are very liars to and cheaper places and the furniture is the same or better I do not recommend this place
