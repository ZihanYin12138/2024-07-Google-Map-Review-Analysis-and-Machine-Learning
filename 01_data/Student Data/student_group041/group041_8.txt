Decided to try the place again today and found a long black hair in my curry which made me lose my appetite. My boyfriend had the panang curry which was literally just curry and meat, no

Love the flavors! The pad thai and pad see ew was so good. The ingredients were fresh. Definitely on my top 5 for Thai food in the valley.  I will be returning to try more of their dishes! I found them on Yelp and beside the food pics teasing me, what attracted me was how good their prices were for amazing quality Thai cuisine.</text>

Quite good food. There are some traditional items that are not normally on American menus that are very tasty. The service is good, and the hostess is very nice and funny. I had a really terrific tom Yum soup there.< /Review>

Best Thai in the Valley. Sure you think you know one better but you don't. With their grandmoms cooking and the family staff up front, this place feels like you belong there and are being cooked for with care. The lunch specials are exceptionally filling and well priced. Trust them to make the food you should have been having all along.<//Review>

<review>The best $5 lunch special around.  What a deal.  So far I've loved everything I've tried here aside from the sweet and sour lunch special and that on my last order they didn't give me the peanut sauce for my salad and instead used some nasty thousand-island tasting dressing.  A+ place--they know what vegan is and will even make the thai iced tea with coconut milk if you request it.  The Thai Iced tea is strong BTW--go for the smaller size if you don't want to be a spastic.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Got their yellow curry chicken lunch special and had it delivered to my work place. Food was warm and flavor was comforting. Price for lunch special was reasonable, but I was not pleased with the amount of meat and veggies in it. I got what i paid for.  I guess if i ordered a la carte, I would have satisfied my hunger and craving.<//Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>It actually pains me to have to write this review because this place has some of the freshest, tastiest, and authentic Thai food in the noho area.. but I am absolutely disgusted with their delivery and customer service. My family and I order from Bua Siam at least once a week.. and I have NEVER had a problem. But today, the delivery man held my food HOSTAGE until my fiancé gave him a cash tip. He argued with him and caused a huge scene in front of the complex, yelling and screaming at us that he deserves a tip. I always give a tip, AND HAD CASH FOR HIM, but not after he was screaming and yelling and withholding the food I ALREADY PAID FOR. He told us not to ever call them again, and proceeded to curse at us as we walked away.

Unbelievable. This place has been one of our favorites for a very long time, but after today and the way he treated us, I'm done.

It's sad that one delivery man can make this place look bad. If I pay for my food, you better give me my food. Learn how to treat your customers with respect. No amount of tastiness will ever replace a horrible customer service experience.

He told us never to call back, and well, we won't. EVER.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

My top 3 choices are: the Tom Kah soup, Pad Thai and Pad See Ew, but the papaya salad is slowly about to take over one of those spots! With the days getting hotter and hotter I find their papaya salad really hits the spot. (I usually order a side of sticky rice with my papaya salad.) I like it on the spicy side so I ask for "medium" on their mild-medium-hot scale. The Thai tea is okay, but sometimes it really is over or under the right amount of sweetness.
Parking lot is nearly impossible now! Plan to circle the lot many times... And then park on the street. Maybe, if your lucky enough to find one!</Text>

Food is almost always on par. Top faves are lard nah, pad see Ew, papaya salad and spicy crab fried rice. The missing star is from the waiter/waitress change and the fact that they don't do the 10% disc anymore.< /text>

<Text>Beware! .... the food is ok BUT you have to be carefull . The owner is terrible!!!! If they mess up your order or send you bad food they will make your life hell so that they do not have to refund your money. I ordered from them and they sent me raw meat and raw pad seeew that was clumped together. I had people over for dinner and was so embarrased . I called and let them know and they wanted me to return all the food in order to get my money back. I ordered delivery. I dont have time to wait for them . I ordered at 530pm and the owner was at my house knoking at 9pm blowing up my phone to return her food. I had guests to feed. Did she really expect me to wait that long? or to be home when she showed up? ... If you order from jere checkkkkk yourrr foooddd... because it will take hourssss for you to get your money back or your food exchanged. This is extremly unproffesional and I wasted my money on this place so be very very careful. The owner will yell and be very veryyyy rude if you call and complain about your food.< /Text><rate>1<//rate></record>

(Translated by Google) They changed owners, we had like 8 months without going. But now if we are going to return, the food and the service are better, I liked it a lot, continue like this and we will continue to be frequent customers. You can see that they like to do their job well. Congratulations!

Usually like this place but this is the first time I've ever been to a dispensary and couldnt get any help/insight for what i was looking for. I just wanted some wax (indica). I asked if he could help me with telling me which ones are indica ect. And which were the grams or half grams (small writing on box), all he could say is you can look. Anyways I doubt I'll be back even if I do work across the street. Nothing on the boxes telling me if there indica/sativa I know they usually go by a color code on there flower but being left to figure it out on my own......(there were no other customers)< /text>

Had the blessed opportunity of being the first patient of the day and meeting Mr.Grant himself. He took the time to explain to me all the products and little breakdown of the company's themself so I had a knowledge of the strains I was purchasing. Very informative and patient was an awesome experience. Waited a day to write this review to also say the Peach tea was delicious! Cali Kush was on point thanks!  loved the sedated feeling it gave me. Definitely coming back this week! Thank you for all the knowledge you've got yourself a loyal customer best thing to come to Boyle Heights! Real Medicine Real People< /text>

The best place I've been to!!! Dre was Kool and 💯 about the different strands and what as worth buying and what wasn't. Not just trying to get you to buy the most expensive things they have. And O.G. Jerry was very knowledgeable about everything in there able to answer any questions you have. They make you feel like you just it somewhere kicking it I had a great experience there. I recommend them to everyone!!!</Text>

Honestly this place is well put together, brotha Customer service was on point. Once I made my weed of choice I asked him about his promotions on first time clients, he mentioned they give an extra gram so that is what I chosen. Here's where things get sketchy; I had to return to my car for cash and after I returned, I noticed my order wasn't there. He then got the order I asked forť but not the gram, after I mentioned it he asked me if it was my first time and reminded him it was. He then still proceed to the register to complete my order. Before leaving I directing asked him do I still get a free gram and he again asked if I was a new, but this time in a way that its his first time being asked. After answering "again" he said I was good. Confused and a little annoyed I noticed I wasn't given anything but the order.< /review>

< review>
I was driving down Soto like always after I picked up some samples. I see #cc and I had never stopped but today I stopped and had to  check it out, now I just wanna be clear I was not paid to write this, now back to the story. I stopped and went in, I smoke so why not give them a try, well I can say I was very pleased with the presentation clean and beautiful but the best part is everything is labeled and the packaging is great. I happen to run into the owner and let me tell you he was very knowledgeable about his products. Most the time I go to shops and they have no knowledge about the product so you might get something different because the staff isn't aware of what products they have but not here , we talked for about 10 min and I walk out with two pre roll #crucialcandy and #sativa they gave me taste of a tea as well and let me tell you I walk out with one of those as well. All in all great place to get your buds. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE PRICES ARE GREAT. This may be my only shop now it's close to my business and well it just can't get any better.< /review>

< Review>
I’ve only recently heard of this place a month ago, I took off on a road trip and ended up having lunch with friends at this cozy fun establishment. It’s a family owned and run business with a happy fun loving atmosphere‼️I ordered the cheese burger lunch with french fry’s and it was well worth the wait. Sitting at the bar I could see in the kitchen, the owner just takes orders and cooks away. It takes a while (and states just that on the menu)
Towards the end of our burgers a lady gives us another burger and apologized for the wait. all and all this was a very enjoyable visit. I’ll be going back..<//Review>

Food is great and the people working the place were very friendly! We sat outside to eat and the set up is super nice in the grass. 10/10 will stop here again on future road trips!!!<//text>

This is a popular local bar and grille. It has an old style ambience, with many photos and signage on the walls and bar. The owners and staff are wonderful friendly people. The place is small but the food is delicious, well prepared and plenty of it.< /review>

Wonderful atmosphere, amazing staff and the best food I've had in my life. All the hype I've heard about it doesn't even cover how amazing it is there. I cannot put how awesome the food is into words. I will absolutely be going back again and again. We will actually be returning tomorrow for karaoke. If you even have a slight desire to try it, do it. I guarantee you won't regret it.< /text>

<review>I am never disappointed when I dine at the Airport Inn. Delicious steak sandwhich.Cooked just right.  The meal comes with fresh fruit and green salad. Generous slices of fruit and garnish. Cold beer and a nice garden area to dine. If your going to Mariposa and the Yosemite area you'll get a tasty meal there.< /review>< pictures>

This has to be the worst place l have ever visited! First off they are way over priced for such a run down hole in the wall with nasty food! The server was nice so we paid for our food and left her a nice tip, but l can honestly say it was the very first time that my husband and l have left a restaurant with all our food still sitting on the table!</Text>

<text>Staff is Amazing...Totally on top of EVERYTHING!!!  Food is SUPERB!!!!  Honestly WAY BETTER Than you would think for a small place such as this!!!  My husband had the 1/2 lb burger and fries....He LOVED IT, But the Burger was So Good, fixed as he requested, that he couldn't finish the fries, which were FANTASTIC as well!!  I had the special of the night which was pork steak, mashed potatoes, vegetable of my choice, of which there were many to choose from, and I chose the home made clam chowder, over the salad.  The chowder was amongst the best I'd had.  The pork steak was HUGE....The Mashed Potatoes and Gravy were SOOOOO YUMMY You'd Swear your grandma made them!!!  And the brocolli was DELICIOUS!!!  I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK AND TRY The Meatloaf  Special!!!  YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG TO GO TO THE AIRPORT INN TO EAT AT ANY TIME!!!<//text>< Pics>

A place with great food. Huge portions (I am not kidding...ridiculously huge) of amazing grub lovingly tended to by Chef Robbie. The Friday meatloaf is a must but get there damn early because it runs out fast. Lots of flair decorates the old wood. A favorite Clamper hangout.<//Review>

The dinner came with soup or salad to start. The entree included mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, assorted veggies, and a bite of strawberry, cinnamon cake, and watermelon for dessert, all loaded onto a HUGE plate! Also, the bar had a good variety of local CA beer on tap. There is a shuffleboard table, a pool table, and a darts board. Saturday night is karaoke from 8-12. All of the people were very friendly and there were so many hilarious signs lining the walls of the diner. We'll be coming back!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><GmapID>0x8096b6601b229a8f:0x31163bfcd3cf30b2<//GmapID>< rate>

Kareoke on Saturdays from 8pm to 12am. Very old school place. I would definitely come back and try their meatloaf.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Amazing food! And their always hosting some fun event.  You won't go hungry here.  Serving sizes are humongous!  Almost as if you are in an old Western bar and everybody is so friendly.  They have a pool table, a shuffle board table and even a deck of cards if you want to play go fish with the friends.  Since they serve food and have tables away from the bar they are kid friendly.  I look forward to going here I love this place so much!</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x8096b6601b229a8f:0x31163bfcd3cf30b2</gmapID></record>

I got the half-pound cheeseburger and tater tots and is the best meal I've had in forever. The owners are amazing people and work hard to keep the place going. Be sure to try the clam chowder.< /Review>

<text>One of my absolute favorite places I've found up in these mountains. Best burger in Mariposa or any of the other nearby towns. Enormous portions, even comes with a dessert. Great drinks at a reasonable price, friendly staff, good tap selection too. Also love the art they have up in their bathrooms.< /text>< pics>

<rate>5</rate><username>Sara Higgs<//username><review>It doesn't get any better than this place.  Always greeted with a smile and for most of us a hug.  It's that bar,  "Where everybody knows your name, and their always glad you came."  The food is top notch and the portions are generous yet healthy.  Best burgers and rib-eyes in the area, cooked perfectly to your liking. BTW, did I mention, the fries are cut fresh to order. Family owned and operated with a great down home country feel.  Great, drama free night life, with jukebox, billiards, darts, dice and shuffleboard table.  See ya out there, I know I'll be going back again and again.<//review>< resp>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Stopped in this most amazing little place today. Not only do they have some interesting decor that you could spend a couple of hours looking at( pictures of my true love Sam Elliot) but girls you gotta visit the restroom!! Now lets get to the service and food. Both were outstanding. You first look at the menu and you might think that 10 dollars is a bit pricey for a burger and fries. And, it might be if a burger and fries is all you get, but let me say I have never had so much come with a burger and fries. Delicious fries (homemade) and tons of them. Then comes a yummy burger with all the fixins on the side but not just the normal lettuce, tomato and onion. Oh NOOO, on this platter, not plate, there is a slice of watermelon, an orange slice, half of a hard boiled egg, carrot slice, cucumber slice, olives and pickles, a nice fairly mild pepper and then on top of all that there is a slice of cake. There wasn't an empty spot on the platter and it was all delicious. The young lady that waited on us was absolutely awesome. We will definitely return to this wonderful little stop in the road and bring friends. You will impress them!!</review><gmap_id>0x8096b6601b229a8f:0x31163bfcd3cf30b2</gmap_id><Date>1492994153383<//Date>< Name>

<Review>This outstanding establishment is unique in many ways. Great owners, Robbie and Tom Nelson,  and support staff.    Audrey, Dianne, Kimber, and my great friend, Dale. No better people in this world than them.
Robbie's kitchen is like no other in Cali. Everything that she serves is outstanding , freshest ingredients, plus everything is homemade with her heart. Plenty of cold beer and an array of wines and specialty libations, however for your info, no hard liquor is served.
For me personally, they offer 2 pool tournaments each and every week
8ball on Wed nite and 9ball on Sunday nights, but must be signed up by 6:55 each evening. No exceptions, 7:05 too late. Competitive, but loads of fun.
Finally, I love this place for the people, especially the locals, who walk thru there front door.
Lastly, on Sat night,  they have some of the best Karaoke singers in Mariposa county and surrounding areas. They fire this up usually around 8:00 pm and shut it down around midnight.
All in all, the Airport Inn, is your best bet to enjoy a magnificent experience,  so come and mix it up with my friends and myself.
Make it a point to stop in and say hello to Tom and Robbie, and the gang.

Ps. Take out available!  !
Check out the meatloaf platter on Fridays.

Pss. Sorry for my length but its from my heart
Thank you for your patience,  Jay R<//Review>< pics>

<Review>My favorite Mariposa place, great burgers, and has the best pastrami sandwich and deep fried mushrooms I've ever eaten.  Best value in Mariposa with the quality and amount of food at real reasonable prices.  Great options and presentations.  Great on tap beer selection (13?) for those times I'm relaxing with the wife and not working.  As noted in other reviews, there sometimes is second hand smoke around.  It does not bother my wife nor I, but would recommend ordering 'to go' and eat up at the airport if tobacco smoke offends.  There is outdoor seating as weather permits.<//Review>< time>

<resp>{'time': 1467852476211, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your review. It is always great when locals tell me their thoughts.\n\nAs for the second hand smoke, there is no smoking allowed in the bar anymore, our last day of that was on Friday, July 1st. We were the last bar that was allowed to have smoking by the state, however, that ended on July 1st. There should never be a problem like this again.\n\nThank you again for your review, I hope you will come again and sign our guest book and introduce yourself to me.\n\nRobbie'}</resp><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

Found it on Google - wasn’t disappointed.

My wife and I went on a Friday night after dinner. Mostly a 30’s crowd - some younger some older. The bar is the main attraction and they deliver - outstanding custom craft drinks with a super friendly staff.

They also have several ‘off menu’ rare whiskey’s, rye’s and bourbon’s.

Bartender’s have a deep knowledge of their craft and they take it seriously.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Quaint bar with comfortable decor. It is not a large place but offers engagement and intimate setting offerings.

As a strictly cocktail bar, they're very focused on menu. It covers the ryes, rums, gins, etc but came across overly limited.

Everyone was friendly with skill. I did the American trilogy which was balanced well.

For a date night closer or starter, or otherwise friend hang out for good cocktails would go here.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwCP8Ycb-_gohoMEunQpDKMlNLlGBEPFUKqOWL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMF6GqlKen7teRbNtVlyAStKa7MH3hLO10b5t3Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< rating>

People lining up around the corner, no parking,  hour long wait before getting a seat.  Well that is called a sign of what's to come.

Photo is of the aftermath of our massive meal.  Ate like a Mexican king and still food left over.

Great salsa bar, great booze at the bar, great food. Reasonable prices!<//Text>

If you enjoy Bibo Ergo Sum bars (not for everyone I understand) definitely check this place out! Try the Chief Lapu Lapu or the Eastern Sour.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

It’s obviously in high demand, and there are a lot of people hovering around waiting for you to leave. The bartender made my first and not last chocolate espresso martini, which may be my new drink of choice! I thoroughly enjoyed myself here!</review>< Pictures>

< review>
Extremely disappointed! This has been my favorite restaurant, however tonight I have been so disappointed. We came early and ended up parking outside the parking and just walked in. By the time we came back out, the back gate was closed. As we were walking down the stairs we watched the valet guy open the gate for a car. Yet when we came down, we asked if he could open the gate so we could walk out and he refused! Made us walk all the way around the block, just because he was mad that we did not valet! After a great dinner, he was so rude, which ruined the whole evening. I really hope no other customers have to encounter such terrible treatment after spending their money here.</review>

My favorite Brazilian bbq place in Los Angeles area. Bibo bar is always fresh and clean with lots of varieties. Of course their cheese balls are the best. Meat quality is pretty good  but their roasted pineapple is my ultimate favorite. Good service through out and a nice place for date nite out.</text>

This place brings me right back to the Nashville music scene, the band is super enthusiastic. The guitar player was awesome even though the speaker quality wasn't the best. Old school funk and blues mixed in a dose of country here and there. Definitely a lot of fun.< /Review>

Nightlife at the California Academy of Sciences is a great way to get the adults out for a fun night of "playing" kid.  You get to explore and learn about science and nature all with the comfort of drink in hand.  Small bites are served a little pop-ups and inside the cafe for those who need substance other than liquid.<//review>

<name>Garry Corret< /name><Review>If you've read or seen the film 'The Prestige', you'll be a fan of this slightly hidden from sight cocktail bar located in the newly renovated Robertson Plaza.

The cocktail menu is separated into the three parts of a magic trick - The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige. The Pledge focuses on the seemingly normal with slight variation made to the classics. The Turn transforms the seemingly normal to the extraordinary by turning the twist up a notch. The Prestige is the culminating final act that combines the lessons of the first two acts and spins up something even more grandeur; cocktails on this page focus on layering unique ingredients together to create a complex palette.

Behind the scenes, all the best practices of composing a standard craft cocktail follow. This includes the chilled glassware, the chipping away of large chunks of clear ice, and the right aromatic toppings.

The interior is beautifully decorated and follows an art deco look. Beautiful lighting decorate the cabinet fixtures and ceiling.

I had the Sing Sing from the Prestige page, which based on the name & ingredients seemed to be an evolution of the Singapore Sling. Unlike the usual sweetness of the Sling, the Sing balanced the taste and packed quite a punch. It was a refreshing kick to start the evening.<//Review>< gmapID>

This is my favorite bar ever.
It's tiny and dark - real good speak easy feel to it.
The drinks are super strong, the staff is so amazing and they have kareoke/trivia nights.
Oh and did I mention they have food?? Rosemary garlic fries and chicken strips help me not be a mess the next day
Try the "bubble rainbow bunny"- super sweet and cant be beat- 2 of those and I will be singing kareoke =</text>

< Review>
Bibo is hands down my favorite cocktail bar in this part of town! Yes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I really dig the ambiance and the art deco decor. The entrance is semi-hidden, tucked away in the corner of a plaza. Can't speak too much about the food, but I would recommend nearly every drink I've had here. The drink menu is really quite creative the way the drinks are organized. Staff is knowledgable as well and can give great recommendations if you're unsure of what to order.

Note that they also have a stellar happy hour weekdays from 5-7pm with $6 martinis and $8 wines. When they first opened a bit over a year ago it was never too crowded, but it seems like more and more people have been stopping by as of late. I guess the secret is out!<//Review>

<text>Very cool cocktail place that doesn't really blend with the overly trendy area. Drinks are very good and affordable. Bartenders are super cool to offer recommendations or bespoke creations. Great place for the date or small groups because it doesn't get that loud, so good convos over drinks can entail<//text>< pics>

I'm not much of a mixed drink kind of person. In general, I don't like bourbon, whiskey, rye, etc. So why did I end up at Rye, you ask? Because I came with some friends and it was relatively empty.</review>

Bibo has something for everyone and there’s no other bars in that area that can beat the drinks, staff, vibe, and decor.  A must visit if you’re in BH/Weho< /text>

<text>Jack was the best! Thank you for making the process painless and fair. Went next door to CarMax, got a written appraisal from them and BidLane was able to beat it. Very happy with my experience and outcome...the Lyft home was a special touch =)< /text>< Pics>

Sold my second car to Bidlane today and I am beyond pleased. The process was super quick and simple. Bidlane made selling my car a fast and professional experience. Great staff and I got the price I wanted for my vehicle. Thank you very much.<//Text>

I sold one car through Bidlane. It was good in pricing, but used car business is also getting highly competitive in 2021. Carmax stepped up their appraisal, and Shift is highly efficient and competitive in offering.</text>

Jose and the team of Bidlane demonstrated excellent customer service and profession. The whole process of selling my car is easy and the communication is great. The team is super friendly, accommodating, and flexible, and their offer is straightforward and competitive. Choosing Bidlane saved me a lot of time and hassles. Highly recommend Bidlane and their business practices! We need more company like Bidlane in OC.< /Text>

This is my second time selling my cars at Bidlane. I always have a great experience! Jack was very nice and helpful. He even followed up with me and helped me get the paperwork I needed. He was soooo accommodating and friendly! I will continue to refer people to BidLane in Irvine!< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Bidlane is awesome! Since Covid we have not driven our second car very much and we wanted to sell it since we were finding that in general, even prior to all social changes, I mostly just used it as a commuting car. Now that I'm able to work from home I wanted to sell it but didn't want to expose myself or my family to risk of getting sick or such. Fortunately, Bidlane made it simple for these times. I sent them my specs, pics and necessary information, they quickly responded and came out to pick up the car. I worked with Jose on the phone and a different guy picked up the car. Both were friendly and helpful. Bidlane to selling cars is what Amazon is to e-commerce. Seriously, it was so easy and straight forward it felt too good to be true. But isn't that the way all businesses should be? Honest and straight forward and important to me, fast. I dreaded selling the car prior because I didn't want to deal with the hassle like I have in the past but not with Bidlane. No haggling. I was straight up honest about what needs work on my car(very minor stuff) and they were honest about price offer, it was same as KBB value.  I called their bank to confirm account number to make sure check was good before handing over the Title and signing everything. Check has cleared and we no longer have an extra car we have to upkeep. Thanks Jose and team!<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>They trying to trick you to sell your car below low fair value. When you show appraisal from somewhere else  with higher estimate they bring their offer up. Why you didn’t offer same price at first if the car worth more. The difference was more than double of initial offer from Bidlane.<//Text><rate>1< /rate><GmapID>0x80dce9e3c1a4ce21:0xcadb312f606ef4f7</GmapID>< username>

Got a call within an hour after getting the Kelly Blue Book instant offer. The appointment was set up for the next day.  Got there and Marcus took care of everything quickly & efficiently. Received more than the instant offer. All required paperwork was completed by Marcus & we signed, got copies & were done. Spent less than an hour. Easy way to get rid of a car. Thanks Marcus & Bidlane< /review>

Very pleased with the service I received! Marcus and Kevin were easy to work with —responsive, personable, knowledgeable and really cared about my experience. They definitely took the sting out of a painful situation (needed to sell a new, 2-month old car). Marcus was especially patient and flexible as I looked into all my options. I highly recommend this company and these two excellent professionals.<//review>

Probably the easiest and most pleasant experience
I have had dealing with the stress of an auto sale.
Marcus was amazing - professional in every way .
I have already referred him to my business colleague  as his wife needs to sell and purchase.

<text>Selling our car to Bidlane was quicker, easier, and way more pleasant than I could have imagined. Between the appraisal and the transaction, the process took no more than 30 minutes. They paid a competitive rate, were honest and transparent in answering some questions I had, were flexible with my time frame, gave my kids snacks in the office, and even paid for a Lyft home. I would highly recommend Marcus and the team at Bidlane to anyone looking for the best way to sell a car!< /text><Date>1567480398685</Date><Pics>None<//Pics><gmap_id>0x80dce9e3c1a4ce21:0xcadb312f606ef4f7</gmap_id></record>

Got an estimate from KBB, Marcus the go to guy here  and he offered a better price (obviously with the car condition etc). The whole process is simple and hassle free , inspection was good.
I definitely recommend to give Bidlane a try if you have plans to sell the car. Just take an appointment , pretty easy.</review>

Marcus was very accommodating with me and was willing to beat a competitors price and offer a little more. They even gave me a couple of more days on my offer, which was very helpful. The whole process took less than an hour and I was given a check and a lyft ride home. Overall I really appreciated the fast service and if anyone is looking to sell their car go to bid lane to get your car appraised.<//text>

Props to Kevin & Marcus for taking care of me. Although we had a small hiccup, their customer service was beyond my expectation. Compared to Car Max, these guys blow it out of the park with how smooth it's done. I came in for an appraisal, met Marcus and within 10 minutes I received a higher appraisal than Car Max. I arrived Sunday expecting to sell my car because I was picking up my new car, but they had forgot to call Honda for the payout amount. Kevin let me leave my car in their lot and got me a Lyft to the dealership. I came back the following day to finalize all the paperwork and receive my check. Overall, I'm very pleased with how things went, don't hesitate to come here, you won't be disappointed.<//review>

<text>Found Bidlane by accident, luckiest mistake I’ve made in a long time. Went to carmax first and saw what a nightmare ordeal that was going to be! Drove to Bidlane next door and had a great deal in no time. Marcus was super nice and made the experience a pleasure. Can’t say enough good things about Marcus and Bidlane! HIGHLY recommend.< /text>< rate>

< Review>
I came here a year or so ago and was not treated with respect. Was treated as if the car I brought them was a joke. 2017 Silverado with 61,000 miles.
The offer I received was 9,560, i asked why so low. I was told that’s just how much the truck is worth. So I asked, if it’s only worth 10k why are they selling them across the street for 32,000? He said the 20k difference was the sales reps commission..
The company states that they “Care about their clients, they Care about being fair,” that should be changed to we care about our income and don’t care about our clients”.< /Review>

<Review>Justin and Kevin were great to work with. They were able to get me a little more than Carmax was willing to pay for my car. The process was easy and they even paid for my Uber to pick up my new car. Thanks! I would highly recommend giving them a call when you are ready to sell your car.</Review>< pics>

Sold my 2014 MINI Cooper Wednesday. Marcus at the Irvine location was friendly, thorough and quick with the entire appraisal process (some internet snafu but not holding that against them, there's always "off" days ha!). Got a few hundred dollars more than Carmax!! If you're thinking of selling your car, definitely do your homework (I did), ultimately BidLane came through for me. I would highly recommend going to them, they work on referrals too so make sure someone referring you texts the person at BidLane first. If you are seriously considering selling your car, BidLane makes the process super easy. The way I see it, nowadays who really has $10k plus in cash ready to buy a car, places like BidLane makes it that much easier to sell your car fast and you walk away with a check!</text>

Marcus and his associate made my 2004 Acura TSX sell process super easy.  The total process was very professional and flawless. They made sure filing the liability transfer and erased all home links, navigation, and all security related stuff. They offered me a nice Bidlane bag to put all the stuffs. They cut me a check in less than 30 minites. At the end they hired a Lyft at their expense to send me back to work. I definitely recommend Bidlane Irvine for selling your used car. Solid 5 stars.<//text>

I had a great experience at BIDLANE!  They beat Carmax’s quote nicely!  Marcus was very polite, nice and helpful in my situation, where Carmax had made a car model mistake on my quote.  Marcus checked DMV info and verified carmax had put in that they were buying my car, incorrectly.  I had to go back to Carmax for a correction while Marcus was getting the rest of my paperwork done so i wouldn’t have to wait much.  I’m definitely recommending them next time. Cheers.

Went there with my 2003 Infiniti FX35 with 130k miles. It's in good condition and drives well with no problems. They offered $800. I bought this for 6k two years ago expecting to get at least 2k for it. When I tried to leave they asked the lowest I'd let it go for. I left because I'm not going to haggle with a company who tries to low-ball right off the bat. I'll sell it privately.</text>

Don't look elsewhere when you need to sell your car fast. Bidlane offered great cash price for my car and Kevin was extremely friendly and informative. I sold my 2016 Outback to Bidland and I was 100% satisfied with the sale. The transaction was fast and hassle-free. I would recommend Bidlane to all my friends and family when they need to sell their cars. Thank you Bidlane.</review>

<time>1538584015135< /time><rate>5</rate><Text>I had a great experience with Kevin at BidLane. I took my 10-year-old Lexus to CarMax first, then decided to test BidLane's claim that they'd beat CarMax's price.  True to their word, BidLane was able to beat the CarMax offer by $300.  The paperwork and transfer process couldn't have been easier, and I got my payment check on the spot. Kevin was very friendly and trustworthy, and I never felt pressured or uncomfortable in the slightest.  BidLane's Irvine office looks a little makeshift and sketchy, but don't let that scare you -- they are legit!  I'm very happy with my experience and would definitely recommend this company to friends and family who want a no-hassle experience selling a car.<//Text>< pics>

Salad was good however, it had a bit too much mayonnaise. Food came out with speed and quality. Would recommend to anyone looking for a quick bite!< /Review>

The karaoke is why I went though, we started before peak time but they still charged us 25$ for each hour we were there even though the first one should have been cheaper. They don't let you know when your time is up so that you go over your time and have to pay more. They won't allow you free water in the room, when I asked for water they made me pay for bottles, and the only thing I ordered they got wrong. I wanted a tea and they brought me a smoothie. It was still fun, but overall disappointingly expensive.< /text>< time>

<Review>Loved the personal rooms for karaoke!  Employees came to check up on us periodically but only thing was there was a sign on the door saying no outside drinks but there was a an empty 36 case box of Budweiser outside one of the karaoke rooms.  I'm pretty sure it was the owner's/employees friends n family but hey!  Shouldn't rule apply to everyone no matter who or is it just me?</Review>< Resp>

<Review>Very enjoyable casual restaurant.

The menu is a little daunting, as the selection is MASSIVE, but the times I have visited have left me quite happy with my food.

It's not some incredible must-visit spot, so don't come looking for something spectacular, but I highly recommend it if you are a local looking for an inexpensive casual meal.< /Review>< GmapID>

I love the food here usually. I would not recommend getting the teriyaki chicken rice plate. This time though there was someone smoking inside the building and there were cigarette butts near the emergency exit. Not cool especially as I have asthma and it is illegal in California to smoke inside a place of business and they have no smoking signs in the building.<//Text>

karaoke room upgraded, looks way better! however, the machine is difficult to search with and hard to find specific bands, or artist for English. plus no Disney songs. the machine and little tropes is clearly Chinese orientated, understandably so, but for English speakers it's gonna be a small challenge finding what you need .< /text>

My sister and I have been to Blue Moon twice. Both times were for lunch. We are not Asian but everyone else in the full restaurant was. Blue Moon offers a nice lunch menu with each item $6.45 (with tax, = $7.00!) My sister ordered a fish dish over rice and a delicious sauce. General serving - she ate every bite. I had the sesame chicken with rice. Everything was steaming hot and fresh. We spoke with a couple of other diners and they explained what they were eating. We almost got whiplash twisting our heads to see what was coming out of the kitchen next. Oh, drinks came with the lunch specials. I must admit, no refills were included.

If you like karaoke, this might be an interesting place. It is not a night club environment. Rooms of various sizes designed to accommodate small to large groups are located in the rear of the restaurant. Each room has seating and TV. For a fee, you gather your group and make your own private karaoke party.

I go for the food. Most of it is Hong Kong Style. We had no problem with the service. She was attentive and prompt. I like it! Thumbs up.< /Text>

I like the distinct taste of the ice cream here. Very edgy, Crystal Cream brand, never unwelcome. We come here often for dinners and special events and actually used the karaoke rooms several times. Only problem with them is that the song selection is pretty outdated.<//Review>

< Review>
We have not been here for several months and decided to drop in today.  Our previous experiences with the food  were not good after the original owner sold the restaurant. However today seemed to be much better. We ordered hot and sour soup to share. Its a large bowl big enough for several cups each and loaded with stuff. I don't care for the flavor of bamboo and unfortunately it was loaded with bamboo. Next time I will advise them to leave it out. But it was spicy and flavorful. We also ordered eggplant with pork in a hot pot over rice. So very yummy. I was sorry I didn't take another order to go for dinner!🐷
We finished with a scoop of Mango icecreme.  Creamy fruity flavor to complete a nice meal. Be aware the ice cream is now 2.50 a scoop not 1.75 as stated on the menu.  Guess the staff didn't even know the price was wrong on the menu. The waitress was nice but very hard to understand unless you speak Chinese and we don't.  In spite of that we all managed ok.  We will be going back soon and I will be willing to try some of the dishes we used to enjoy here again. We like to support local businesses.  Give them a try!< /Review>

<text>It is a really awesome place to just hang out with your friends, first dates, co-workers night out, and other fun events such as Birthday parties! It is a true diamond in the rough, whole in the wall. A relaxing atmosphere within the Cafe. Great sized rooms for Karaoke and Super Great Happy Hour Deals!

While in the karaoke rooms you can't have opened drinks unless they provide it (Does not include liquor, liquor is for the cafe) which is easy to deal with. You can always drink before or after singing.

The workers are great, with the exception of one female that acts like she was forced to have the job. (Aside from her, they are worth your curiosity)< /text>< rate>

<text>Good HK style/taiwanese style plates. Has karaoke rooms available sectioned off toward the back of the restaurant. Remodeled and now has more room for large parties. Before it was like a small cafe almost, with the karaoke as the late night entertainment. Now you can have a party there and utilize the karaoke private rooms if you wish to continue the party into a late night private event.< /text>< pics>

<review>Been here twice and i'm always more than satisfied! :)
We always go during happy hour though, it's a lot more affordable per hour.
I especially love that their karaoke rooms are private so you don't have to humiliate yourself in front of strangers, you can just humiliate yourself in the comfort of your friends.
I've only ordered their fried rice and broccoli beef and its pretty good, not the best, but it's not bad either.
The place is always clean, and they always offer brand new(sealed) covers for the mics- for those of you who find it necessary to sing with the mic pressed up against your lips (gross!)
in the end we (my friends and i) always split the bill accordingly, and the lady that works there is always nice enough to go through the trouble of calculating it all and charging it all separate for us, even though i can tell it's a BIG hassle for her.
This place is a definite check out/hangout place, why are you still reading this?! GO! :)<//review>< Pics>

I don't like the service, you have to make reservation it is not walk in. the mics are sometimes broken but you get your own room there are however only two microphones so you have to share if there are more than two people.<//text>

This place is AMAZING.

They have private karoake rooms available with flat screens and touch screens. Its a little pricy but its well worth it. Almost every song i wanted to sing or here they had. Service is great as well. Very kind, very happy, like they really wanted to serve me and my group.

Defiently will return.

<review>Terrible service and out of the 5 times I came, it just seemed to get worse. If you're coming for karaoke, the one in Rancho Cordova is 1000x better with service and selection. The food in Blue Moon is also very mediocre and there's not much to say about it.</review><user>115585318604385022940< /user><Time>1518910637919<//Time>< gmapID>

My friend and I have tried going here  a couple times now and we had to move to different karoke rooms about 2 to 3 times each time we gone. Music didn't play right and the whole system would shut off and reboot on its own. We also got put into a large room and was going to be moved the last 30 minutes of our timr and it would have taken 15 min to reboot a new system  and a bit longer to find songs. Just ridiculous .</Text>

(Translated by Google) When I went there for the first time before, it was overcrowded. However, there have been many fewer people recently. The inside is very good, you can also sing k, but the price is 20 yuan an hour, a bit expensive. However, afternoon tea is quite cheap, but it may be due to a change of chef recently. The taste of things is not as good as before, but it is still delicious.

(Original)
之前第一次去的时候，人满为患。但是，最近少了很多人。里面很不错，还可以唱k，但是价钱是20元一个小时，有点贵。不过下午茶挺便宜的，但是最近可能是因为换了个师傅的原因，东西的味道有点不如以前，但是还是很好吃的。< /Review>

<text>Tracy is hands down the best nail tech around! She always goes above and beyond to ensure I am well taken care of. She is incredibly professional and very patient with me, as I am extremely picky when it comes to my nails. Mindy is also phenomenal, she gives the best pedicures and tends to all my outrageous necessities. Without hesitation I recommend booking an appointment with these two wonderful ladies!<//text><pics>None</pics></record>

<Review>They're open and doing mani pedis outside! (Now during this 2nd round of closures due to Covid) I was sooo happy they were able to get me in right away when I called. I was there within 15 minutes and only had another customer. They were very careful about sanitization 👌 I enjoyed the chilly breeze while getting my manicure outside 😊< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1zR6nOtVbWeB4NpBqMsJJXbogviyVNr1E4JEW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dd2fd8cbe01e19:0xb9ffbf8e2736e51d< /Gmap_id></record>

Holly did a great job. It was my first time going to this place. I haven't had much luck with nail salons so, we'll see how this one goes. The place was clean and they have a lot of nail colors to choose from. A little overwhelming to say the least but great.</Text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>Mostly good experiences here. They are clean- which is most important in my mind. I’m not sure if the quality of gel nails I get depends on the technician or the actual gel brand or color I choose, but sometimes they last a month no problem, and sometimes they start peeling around the edges after a couple of weeks. I usually walk in without an appointment and don’t have to wait long; one time I made an appointment and ended up waiting 20 minutes past my appointment time before they had a chair available for me.<//text></record>

<Review>This place is not professional! They currently discriminated & refused to give services to a woman & her sister just because her sister is disabled in a wheel chair. That is so toxic & disturbing of them I have came here before & never again will I enter a place where they discriminate a human just for being in a wheel chair, I do not recommend this place at all there is far more friendlier places with excellent services.<//Review>< pics>

I've tried a good number of nail salons since moving to long beach. The quality in their skill is apparent. The customer service has been great. They are super busy but worth the wait.< /Text>

<Review>Everyone who works here is very kind and professional. I got SNS dip powder manicure here and it was definitely worth the extra $$ because the tech that worked on my nails did such an excellent job. They do everything right here! It was my first time here and now I understand why it is rated so highly!<//Review>< pictures>

This place is dirty and they don’t sanitize the tools. My mom got a infection on her nail beds coming here. They’re pushy on trying to add more things to charge you more and ignore you or make excuses when you want something fixed. Manager lacks manners and etiquette as well as some of the other nail techs. Save your money and go elsewhere.</text>

<text>This is my 2nd time coming here and I can say that this place is awesome.  I had a pedi and mani the 1st time by Lily and she was really good. She took her time providing the service and she was very thorough and meticulous. The foot massage was really nice. I didn't have to make another trip to the reflexology. The manager or rhe owner, Macy, was really nice and she made sure that everything was perfect.  I got the same thing done on the 2nd visit and was even better.</text>< rating>

Would be 0 starts if that was possible. They have discriminated against a young lady who is wheelchair bound. They were saying it would be unsafe for her to sit in a salon chair because of her inability to walk. They have embarrassed and shamed customers for their disabilities and its disgusting and absolutely unacceptable. I think they need a lesson about the ADA and how to accommodate our fellow members of the community with disabilities. Horrific.<//Text>

Let me start off by saying that I have NEVER felt compelled enough to actually share anything negative about business, until today! I have been to L.B Market Nails & Spa dozens of times on my own and have had very pleasant experiences. That is why I was astounded by the way I was treated when I went in with my disabled sister yesterday. We did not receive the usual greeting or hello. After standing there for a while (being stared at like we were aliens), I told them we had appointments at 5pm. They looked at me and said “Oh, just for you, right?” I said no, that we both had appointments. They acted like they had never seen a lady in a wheelchair before in their life! I said she needed pedicure and I needed an SNS manicure. The manager, Lua, walked over and immediately created a scene rudely saying that she didn’t think my sister would be able to get into the spa chair. I politely told her that their pedicure chairs are the same as every other salon we have been to and that it was not a problem. (See photo below at another salon) My sister has been getting pedicures biweekly for years and she sits perfectly fine in them. I then transferred her from her wheelchair into the spa chair with ease as we have always done. Lua stood there and kept arguing that my sister is not safe in their chair. Again, I explained to her that my sister is completely safe. I explained that her disability does not affect her brain. I educated her that cerebral palsy affects her body only and she is not going to throw herself out of the chair. I reassured her that she can understand everything we are saying even though she can not verbalize it. Lua said I would need to sit next to her the whole time because they didn’t have a seatbelt. I said she didn’t need a seatbelt because it’s not a moving wheelchair but I had no problem sitting next to her while she got her pedicure and I got my nails done in the seat next to her. Lua said I would need to wait until her pedicure was over before I could get my nails done because she was not safe. I told her that was ridiculous. We should be able to have our services at the same time as we always do. I told her we would be late for our dinner plans if we had to do one of us at a time. That is why we made appointments for both of us at 5.  At this point, Lua had made us feel embarrassed and totally unwelcome. I explained that we did not appreciate the harassment or discrimination. I asked Lua if she knew anything about ADA. She said she did but I argued that if that were true then she would not be so blatantly disrespectIng our rights. It is my sister’s right to determine if she feels safe, not Lua’s. She refused to have our services done concurrently even if I sat in a chair beside her. I explained over and over how many different salons we have been to over the years (my sis is 46 and I’m 40) and how we have never had a problem or been treated so poorly but she would not budge. This treatment went on for over 10 minutes despite the fact that my sister had been sitting comfortably in their chair the whole time. I looked around and one young woman customer quietly shrugged and mouthed ‘I’m sorry’. We ended up leaving in tears for the embarrassment my sister had endured. I NEVER want another disabled person to be treated the way we were in this salon ever again. Being a flight attendant and in the service industry myself I’m appalled that something like this is happening in 2020. Flight attendants are great about spreading the word and I personally know hundreds of colleagues in the area. I’m going to tell our story and then have them share our story. I 100% believe in boycotting. We are friends with business owners in Long Beach and I’m sure they are going to want to know what’s going on in their community so they can help end this kind of injustice! Long Beach, Calif.< /review>

I highly recommend this nail salon. I had no appointment and had to walk in because I had just broken a nail. They said they would be right with me and I didn't have to wait long. They fixed it and the prices were very reasonable. The store was clean and everyone working there was really nice.</review>

Today was my first visit to this nail salon, and I’ll definitely be going back. Holly gave me a great pedi, and everyone was very friendly and accommodating. If you go, enter thru the back of the shopping center (by Trader Joe’s), due to construction.</Text>

This is a lifestyle shopping center experience. There are probably 50 highend shops here. It is designed so shoppers can park close to the place they're  visiting. It is anchored by Trader Joe's, BevMo, national chain restaurants and an art house movie theater. I go to Sanctuary Skin Care and Day Spa. The Nectar Juice Bar and Trader Joe's regularly. It's very convenient.< /text>

It was okay. I did like the bar with all the pennies laid into it. Also loved they had tajin for my beer. Just wished the bartender was friendlier.<//review>

Had Friday night prime rib in the restaurant side  (look for dining entrance sign to right of bar entrance). Good flavor, tender. Veggies (mixed green beans, brocolli, squash) were beautifully prepared and fresh. Mashed potatoes very tasty and smooth, real. Simple ice cream with carmel sauce for dessert. Margarita on the rocks. A nice quiet time out.  Check the place out, open Fri and Sat for dinner. I remember the place back in the 80's and 90's. Give them a chance, I'll be going back.</Text>

I'm very saddened to have to go to this measure to get their attention but I started my case with this firm back in 02/2020. While I can admit that the opposite party has been a bit of a pain, A1 has not made the experience smooth either. Every time I've reached out for an "update", I get told that they're waiting on a response from the opposite party. Late September of 2020 we were told our case was moved to a different department. On November of 2020, I reached out and they mentioned that our case was litigated which means that it has been filed in court. They did inform me that this process will take a bit. However, it is now June of 2021 and I haven't received an update. I'm a patient person, so I haven't bombarded them with phone calls but the handful of times that I have reached out for an update, no one is available to speak to me. I just want an update. That's all. Keep me in the loop of what's going on. If there's no update, a simple "Hey, we're still working on it" would suffice.

Thank you.<//Text>

<Response>{'time': 1618514101452, 'text': 'Disgruntled job applicant'}< /Response><review>Where to begin? I am currently applying for jobs as a paralegal and ended up receiving a phone call from this establishment last Thursday 4/8/2021 to set up an interview for today 4/13/2021. Before even stepping foot into this office, I realized something was off by the brief phone call that this law firm gave me. Unfortunately, I do not recall who it was that I spoke with, as there was no introduction from whoever worked at this law firm. I answered the phone and immediately they set up an interview with me on 4/13/2021 at 2 pm for a paralegal position. I agreed and asked for them to confirm the details by sending me a confirmation email. Which I though was standard practice, not just for law firms, but for interviews in general. However, when this past weekend passed with no confirmation, I decided to give the law firm a call the day before to confirm said interview. When I called the law firm, this establishment had no record of confirming the interview with me and was confused. That should have been a dead giveaway, that if a law firm cannot even keep track of its interviewees, much less even send a confirmation email for an interview; I believe this shows that the law firm is in utter disarray and disorganized. However, they did eventually confirm the interview that was approximately two hours before the interview was scheduled to take place. I should not have gone into this law firm, but I decided to go into this establishment against my better judgement.  I walked into the law firm, a couple of minutes early before my 2 pm interview, and while the law firm requires you to wear masks, I did not see any of their employees, including the attorney I spoke with, wearing any masks. The interview was less than 10 minutes or so long, as I had my time wasted from me. The attorney I spoke with was incredibly patronizing, where they were looking for someone with multiple years of experience in personal injury law, but unfortunately, I do not possess the experience necessary to fulfill said position. Retrospectively, I would ask, then why would you waste your time as an attorney, and my time as someone who is actively looking for employment? If I was not a fit, I would have preferred to have been automatically rejected from the position instead of having my time wasted with this law firm. I have not worked or been employed with this law firm, and I am glad that I was rejected from this location. I sincerely hope that this law firm takes better safety measures regarding wearing masks, due to the ongoing pandemic, for the safety of their staff and prospective clients. I also wish this law firm the best of luck, and I do hope that they drastically improve their organization skills when hiring prospective employees for this workplace because the law industry deserves a better representation than what this law firm showed me today.<//review></record></dataset><record>
<text>Mr. Mashney and his staff were very welcoming and easy to work with.  Mr. Mashney was very understanding and helpful. The team was very professional and assured me that everything would be alright. Mr. Mashney listened and helped me with everything start to finish.

Mr. Mashney and his wonderful staff are great to work with. They are all very knowledgeable, organized, hard-working professionals who get things done! From the start, Mr. Mashney just makes you feel comfortable and trustworthy of him and his practice. I would highly recommend Mashney Law Offices!< /review>

I started my case about a year ago when I got into my first car accident. I was referred here by a friend and I cannot explain how friendly and how reassuring the lawyers and assistants at Mashney were. I don’t regret trusting them with my case for a second. They handled everything for me and were in contact with me whenever I needed to be updated on any situation. Very happy with how my case was handled.<//text>

If anyone asks me about the best accident lawyer, I would recommend them. Not only did they offer a good legal assistance, but ensured I wasn’t bothered by the defendant’s lawyer. Really appreciate the assistance. Great job!< /review>

I have had two cases so far at Mashney Law Offices and each case was handled with care and efficiency. My first case was for something small, but I got a better result than what I anticipated so I was really happy. The second case is still active with the firm. They have called me a few times to verify information and give me an update. Each time the staff is very warm and friendly. They are also up to date on technology. I was even texting one of the legal assistants one time because I couldn't speak over the phone at the time.

Also, a few of my friends have also gone there for their needs and were happy with the result. I would highly recommend this office for your legal needs!<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I am a doctor who lives in Texas now. A few years ago, I lived in Orange County California. Once I needed to get a lawyer to help me with a legal issue. I was lucky enough to find Stephen Mashney. Mr. Mashney was very helpful in that he very quickly solved my legal issue without charging me a lot of money. He was very quick in responding to my emails and texts. A month ago, while in Texas, I had another legal issue come up. I immediately thought of Mr. Mashney, so I called him. He quickly returned my call and remembered me. Mr. Mashney was honest enough to tell me that because my legal issue was in Texas, he cannot help me because he is licensed in California and not Texas. However, he did not leave me stranded. Instead, he quickly, found me a Texas attorney (who was his nephew) to help me. I have to say that it’s very rare these days to find prompt and helpful lawyers like Mr. Mashney. I highly recommend him and I will always think of him whenever I need a lawyer.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Yes, Stephen Mashney is simply the best lawyer. I know him and his team for over 10 years. And I don’t go to any other but him. What makes him so special, you might ask? Well, first of all he is a “Shark” in his field; as well as very punctual and professional lawyer with tons of experience. He is well known as one if not the best in the community. I come to know Stephen as a man dedicated to perfecting his craft, consuming every piece of law, and understanding every practical application of his profession to real-world problems. His leadership, generosity, and down to earth attitude let me to believe that he would surely make immense contribution to those around him- his contemporaries, his law firm and most importantly his clients. If you need an attorney that “CARES” look no further pick up your phone and call Stephen Mashney.< /Review>

Well for starters my mom is currently with Mashney law and some miscommunication arose with them, but Stephen was quick to access it as well as resolve our situation. We were both men about it and have decided to move forward. Stephen seems like a good honest guy that I can trust right now in providing my mom in her case. As of right now, I have not met Louis, but I look forward to finding out if he provides the same urgency, hospitality, and adequacy for what our case holds in the future. Thank you all for your service.</Text>

Great service, always available to answer my questions. Very nice and  friendly folks. Sam and his team helped me submit my application for Citizenship.
Sam is very through and pays attention to every detail. He provided background and explained the  immigration laws, is patient and very helpful.
He provided great value and his rates were very reasonable. If you need immigration help, I highly recommend Sam and his team, he knows his stuff.  He offers other services as well.</Review>

The professionalism the way are taking my case and the cordial manner that I am treated every time that I go to the Mashney Law Office it's remarkable.  The peace of mind from day one that I was at office asking for help and taking my case without hesitation. ..I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT WITH WORDS. ....

The information of my case always is promptly and explain in the language that I can't have any doubt of what it's going on of case.

I have the sense that I am in the best hands of Attorneys in Southern California.

I highly recommend the Mashney Law Office with any reserved. .

If you're looking for a lawyer then you came to the right place. Finding a lawyer you can trust to handle your case can be tough but when I was referred to Mashney Law Offices all my stress was relieved because I felt like I was in good hands and that they actually cared. Stephen and his team were nothing but great to me. They treated me like family through the whole process. Stephan and his team were there to answer all my questions and concerns 24/7. They always responded to my requests in a fast and timely manner. I am so thankful to have found this law office to handle my case and get me the results. They went above and beyond and really exceeded my expectations. I can't thank Stephen Mashney and his team enough. I 1000% recommend this law office!<//Review>

<text>I retained Mr. Mashney to handle a legal dispute I was having several months ago and strongly believe that he was the right man for the job. From the beginning, I informed Mr. Mashney that I did not want to litigate the issue and was keen on settling the matter outside of court. Mr. Mashney fulfilled my wishes by successfully avoiding litigation and helping me get back on my feet after having dealt with such an ordeal. His professionalism, punctuality, and experience in the field make him an excellent attorney who knows how to get the job done. It was a pleasure hiring Mr. Mashney to handle the negotiations as he kept me informed throughout the entire process and made significant progress from the very start. Based on my experience with Mr. Mashney and his office staff, I would highly recommend him for any legal matter that requires the work of an exceptional attorney.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

It's rare to come across an attorney's office that genuinely cares about its client's peace of mind- but Mashney Law Offices is the exception. From the start, they always kept me informed of any updates and were always more than willing to take the time to answer my questions in great detail. It's been a pleasure working with this firm and I would highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for an attorney who is tenacious and always looking out for the betterment if his clients! Thank you, Mr. Mashney!<//Review>

<Text>When I had my case I could have chosen any law office but decided to retain Masheny law offices, after meeting with the principals.  I had the  pleasure to work with the best lawyers on my case, Sami and his staff and especially Luis, they made the process easy to follow and make a difference in the outcome. Winning the case was the highlight, and the highlight was the satisfaction I got.

I would highly recommend retaining Mashney law offices  for any case that any might have, the staff is highly knowledgeable competent and efficient, understanding and pleasant.<//Text>< pictures>

Not only is he knowledgeable with good integrity, he cares for his clients. I walked in his office and started crying about my situation, he immediately gave me a tissue and nice long talk with a good prospective. He's truly a great attorney!

< Review>
If you've been hurt in an accident and you are considering finding an injury claim lawyer to get any compensation you could be owed, you've come to the right place. Mashney Law office and his team will look after you and will give you all the help and support you need as you recover and set about obtaining injury compensation.

Whether it was Sami himself, or a member of his team I spoke to, I was always given an immediate answer to my questions and concerns. They even set-up doctors' appointments for me so I could be seen and treated with immediate effect.

I thought my claim for compensation would take forever, but I was pleasantly surprised at just how quickly Sami and his team were able to bring things to a successful conclusion. I can't thank them enough for all their hard work and the diligent approach they took.

Having worked with them and got such great customer service, culminating in a compensation claim pay-out, I conclude that they are first class law firm in Orange County and I am happy to recommend Mashney Law office and his team without reservation. If it's a caring professional law firm you're looking for - you've found it.</Review>

I am going to tell you about the worst customer experience anyone has ever had. i went to his office for  a notary  and he continued to interrupt me while i was talking to him. He called me rude and other ugly names. I was shocked that i was being treated this way in a lawyers office, i only heard or seen things like this in the movies. I was soo surprised and thought he must have been having a terrible day and was taking it out on me. He ripped up the documents i was holding and threw them at me with the money i paid to the receptionist. He said he would call the police and told me he would sue me and it wouldn't cost him anything. No one deserves to be treated like this, he is a shame to lawyers and i feel bad for the people that work with him. I hope that anyone going to this office finds this review and are able to read it before going. If you find his yelp page, he has very similar reviews from people who experienced the same thing. The 5 star reviews must be fake, i cant imagine that this man is capable of decent customer service after what i went through. I hope that Mr Mashney reads this and he changes the way he deals with ALL of his customers.

Mr Mashney treated me terribly and was extremely rude and unprofessional. He should really think about the way he treats people. As a lawyer i thought that they would be more professional than how he treated me. I am sorry for the long review but i was really affected and still to today think about the day where i made the mistake and went into his office.< /text>

I have been looking for a legal consultation regarding a matter and i started looking online for an office to call to make an appointment.
To begin woth, the receptionist who answered my call was really professional and she took all info needed from me and as soon she realized it was an urgent matter, she was able to squeeze me into a very soon appointment with Steve.
As soon as i arrived, he had already prepared all sort of legal documents regarding my consultation, He listened to me and took every document i have and digested the case well and asked me as many questions and details regarding my case and then he searched deeply to get me the correct answers. His answers were exactly what i was looking for, his level of understanding to cases was very professional, You can easily tell how professional an attorney is from the way he handles the cases, he seemed to be exposed to alot of such cases, i liked the way he was very aggressive when it comes to getting my rights and when he gets so passionate about your case as if it was his personal case.
He gave me more than enough time and i got all the answers i was looking for. It gave me so much confidence when i also looked at his office walls and saw all the certificates and awards he got.
Not to under estimate this, but his pricing is way too convenient compared to lots of other attorneys i checked with.
I highly recommend this law office as i got all the answers i needed and he also cleared up alot of concerns that i have with the most convenient price.<//review>

My mother came into this office and dealt with Sammy Mashney. She came home distraught, stressed and shaking with anxiety. My mother had come in a few days prior to have a document notarized. She came back in a few days later to follow up because the document was not completed. Mr Sammy Mashney accused her of being rude, ripped up the documents she was holding, gave her a refund and told her to leave his office or he would call the police. ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE!! This is how Sammy treated my mother who came into the office as a customer. Even had my mother been rude as he claims, he proceeded to rip her paperwork, call her vulgar names and threatened to call the cops??? A scene out of a downtown impound yard, not a law office; I couldn't believe what my mother was telling me.

Apparently a notary does not cost enough to warrant decent and fair customer service from this office.  I called him to ask him about the incident and received the same treatment that my mother did. We had this office perform work for us in the past with no issues, though we had never dealt with Mr Mashney till today. I would recommend you reconsider before deciding to hire on Mashney.</review>

I contacted Mr. Mashney's law office on the recommendation of my company's pre-paid legal plan. I was able to meet with Mr. Mashney himself who answered all of my questions and explained the process I was about to begin in detail and with ease.  He introduced me to one of his assistants who guided me through the necessary paperwork and both of them kept in close contact throughout my case.  I am very pleased with not only the legal expertise of the office, but of the personable nature of everyone I encountered.< /Text>

< Review>
I hired Mohamed Eldessouky to represent my interests, he promised he had a ton of experience and would resolve my issue quickly, He accepted my check and we agreed on expectations.  Here we are, four months later, Mohamed Eldessouky has done NOTHING.  I requested an action plan which is customary and he didn't provide one.  I called the cell phone number listed on his business card and we rudely requested that I NEVER call his cell phone again and that I communicate with his office only.  I requested a refund and a statement of accounting and he has not provided anything to me. He is holding my money which I think he believes he's going to keep. I'm having to file a suit against him, Eldessouky Law, and Mashney Law Offices for multiple legal and ethical violations. I'm also filing a complaint with the American Bar Association.

If anyone would like to join me in filing my suit please contact me at shun24 at gmail dot com</Review>

<Response>{'time': 1437608972439, 'text': "Thank you for your feedback. We apologize that your expectations were met not by our firm.\n\nIn your reviews you state Mr. Eldessouky very rudely responded to you when you called his cell phone. This is not true. He simply was away from the office and did not have your file to knowledgably  discuss your case with you.\n\nYour review states that “four months later, Mohamed Eldessouky has done NOTHING.”  You hired us on July 24, 2014. We represented you for 6 weeks until you sent an email on September 6, 2014 where you formally terminated our services. As such, we stopped working on your case at that time. You then sent another email on October 10, 2014  claiming that you were not releasing us. This uncertainty made it very difficult to represent you.\n\nYou said: “He is holding my money which I think he believes he's going to keep.” You failed to mention that on November 10, 2014, we sent you a lenient full accounting with a refund check of $555 from the $1,200 retainer that you gave us. This is despite the fact that our agreement said that the $1,200 are Non-Refundable. We would rather give back money rather than have a dissatisfied client.\n\nYou claim that you intended to file suit against us as well as a bar complaint. However, to date we have received no such complaints. We are sorry that your case did not turn out how you wanted, but we maintain that we did everything we could from our side to obtain a favorable outcome in your case.\n\nWe wish you well and we’ll be happy to help you in the future should you decide to give us another chance."}< /Response>< gmap_id>

Clean, safe, professional and accommodating... especially during this  pandemic. Any time I had a question, the girls in the office were always pleasant and helpful...I would not hesitate to use Storage Etc Long Beach again! Thank you for taking good care of me and my belongings!<//review>

<text>I love this facility! I have been renting from Storage Etc in Long Beach for about three years. The whole facility, inside and out, is always so well kept and clean- even before Covid hit.
First things first, the ladies working here are so kind. I’ve chatted with them multiple times over the years and they’re truly such a delight. Maria opened my account with me and helped me with the paperwork when I moved from a large to a smaller unit. I’ve had to make multiple updates to my billing information and personal info; Maria has been such a blessing and so helpful through it all.
Secondly, this business feels so secure, and not just for your storage unit. The safety measures they’ve taken really make me feel safe visiting my unit any time of day, even though I’m often alone. The parking lot is gated and requires a key code entry. All doors are locked and require the same code to enter. Even the elevators require a key code! It’s great.
The whole facility is temperature controlled, which was AMAZING. For my job, I often have shelf-stable supplements and food samples that would have spoiled or melted in the hot summer heat. Thankfully, I never had any trouble with this at Storage Etc.
When I worked as a sales representative, I had a large unit on the first floor. Storage Etc has multiple flat carts for customer use. These are so convenient and they made it SO easy to bring large amounts of product in an out.
I moved into a smaller sized unit upstairs for my personal items like camping gear and luggage.
Units have a light inside which makes it super easy to access and organize all of your items.
When I was initially shopping for storage in the Long Beach area, I read reviews for many businesses and saw some stories I could not even imagine. The reasons I chose Storage Etc are the reasons I continue to rent from them today. The facility is so clean, well kept, reasonably priced, and very secure. I’ve had years of great experiences with Storage Etc, so I really recommend renting space here!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1616701048598, 'text': 'Thanks for taking the time to leave an awesome review, Natalie!

Do NOT rent from here. We prepaid for two months, making it EXTREMELY clear that we would move out at the end of the two months, and a few days before move-out they told us we would have to pay for an additional month because we didn't fill out their 30-day notice form which they DID NOT provide us when we told them we would be moving out after two months. That cost us an additional $165. RIP OFF.</Text>

This was my first time using a storage facility. I was traveling for 16 months and needed a place to put my things. I am very happy with this facility. The other places I looked at seemed sketchy and not very safe. This facility is very safe with great security measures. It’s also very clean, has AC, is near the freeway, and music playing. Maria runs a tight ship there, which always made me feel like a valued customer. Yenifer also helped me and anytime I had questions, they were both quick to answer.

When moving my stuff after I finished traveling, I needed to get everything across the country. Maria helped me deal with the moving company. I wish I would have realized she had long distance moving company recommendations before I chose the company that I did because I think her recommendations would have been better than the one I chose. Overall, I had a positive experience here, my stuff was safe and secure, and the staff was friendly.< /Text>

< Review>
I typically do not trust Storage Units for various reasons--most of which is seeing various friends of mine having miserable experiences at such units. Storage Etc...was an incredible exception. The staff (especially Maria!) were the most patient, wonderful, helpful, and nice renters I have worked with in any capacity. Prices were very fair, and the units themselves were very clean and incredibly peaceful and plentiful. The system to get in was very easy--unique keypad code for every customer to access the gates, doors, and elevators, so everything feels incredibly safe at all hours of the night. K-Earth is playing non-stop at the storage, and I heard "Tiny Dancer" and "When Doves Cry" more times than I could count--and I appreciated that. Overall, this was the most relaxing and "home-y" public storage I have utilized or even visited. I cannot recommend this Storage Space enough. If you plan to store your things in Long Beach, this is where you have to do it!<//Review>

<Review>I signed up through 3rd party SpareFoot, which had some glitches in setting up the paperwork and also didn’t give me the half-off first month, as advertised. However, I figured that was an issue with SpareFoot and, indeed, when I arrived at Storage Etc. the employee at the front desk immediately gave me the credit and also gave me credit prorated toward the next month, since I’m moving in mid-month. Great customer service, clean, safe looking. I didn’t see a bathroom, and there were no stations with sanitizer near elevators and doors, but that’s acceptable. My only real issue keeping me from a 5-Star is that the space is not close to 5x5. They do make clear that the dimensions are approximations, but you’d think that means you might end up with 4.5x4.5 or something like that. The space I got is maybe 5x3, if that. And of course I was told it was the only space and now I was locked into the lease. If my stuff all fits then I don’t really care, but that bit of square footage can make a big difference when you’re having to clear out your whole office due to COVID closure, which is stressful enough.<//Review><user>105945861058049579992</user>< Pics>

This a great storage! It's very secure and most of all clean. I visited a few places after I went to see a 5x5 and I end up returning to get the unit there because other places do not maintain their building. They have push karts free to use, and camera recording 24/7.< /Review>

Thank goodness I found a good storage, I’m in between houses so finding the right place to store my items was hard. I got a lot of different prices from other storages over the phone, but they did not meet my expectations once I saw those places in person. On the other hand, storage ETC met all my expectations and more. Maria and Yenifer go out of their way to help you, they know their stuffs! Thank you so much for your help!<//Review>

They will make you charge for an extra month telling you that they needed 1 month notice in advance. What's ridiculous is that the notice has to be made precisely on the day of payment, apparently. Even if you make the notice 20 days before the rent payment day, they'll make you pay the rent for the next month. They are running a racket here. BE AWARE OF THE FAKE 5 STAR REVIEWS!!!<//Review>

< Review>
After renting  from several storage places in the past, Storage Etc. have been the best storage facility that I've  came across. Always clean, the employees were always polite and very professional. With air conditioning in the whole facility, I Loved it. If I ever need to get another storage facility again,  I will definitely come back to Storage Etc. And will refer this facility to all my friends and family.</Review>

Great customer service! Stopped by today to inquire about a rental.  The facility was very clean both inside and out. I was given a tour of the units available by Maria. I like the climate controlled units, the secure entance, and the available parking. I will definitely stop by again next month to rent a unit.</review>

My daughter and I have been using Storage Etc over 15 years. It's safe and clean at all times. And the staff is remarkable. They're always helpful, courteous, knowledgeable and friendly. You can't beat this place any place else. Customer service is everything, that's what you'll find at Storage Etc in Long Beach.<//review>

<Text>I came in looking for a unit that was climate controlled and storage etc had exactly what I needed. The managers there showed me the space and also reserved one for me so that it's ready when my truck arrives with my items. The prices are great for how clean and secure the facility is. I will be storing long term and I feel very secure with my personal items being here. Definitely will recommend to my friends and family!

I thoroughly researched storage facilities online throughout the Long Beach area, and found Storage Etc. seemed to cover all of my needs.  Once I secured a unit I was happy to find out they not only covered my initial needs but far exceeded all my expectations.  The staff is friendly, welcoming, and willing to help with anything.  The building and units are clean and feel secure, something that is important to me when I'm alone in the facility.  I would highly recommend Storage Etc. to anyone looking for a storage unit.</Review>

10+ in Customer Service
10+ in  Cleanness
10+ This is one place where the manager who is in charge is not only a welcoming always with a greeting smile lady.  She is an amazing professional who knows how to represent this company. On her own personal managing style she  creates this awesome desire to be loyal to this place. "Maria" brings comfort and aides you to find the best solutions for your storage needs.  I would recommend anyone who may be in need of this facility  to give her a call set up an appointment and you will find an array of amazing solutions with her.  Thank you Maria for your excellent services for all the years. Wishing for you, continual prosperity  and personal and professional successes...!< /Review>

I rented 2 weeks ago and the girl at the front desk was very friendly. She helped me through the move in process. My wife found storage etc using Google and had a friend who previously rented with them and she loved it. So we thought to give it a try and im glad i did. The unit fits my items great. I wouldn't feel safer storing my items anywhere else. Thanks guys!

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>OMG!!! I can't find the words to describe the Staff and Management of this storage facility called Storage Etc. located in Long Beach, CA on Redondo Boulevard. The Manager Maria and Assistant Manager Sabrina are extremely professional and they both go beyond the call of duty in maintaining a WELCOMING and FRIENDLY relationship with the renters of the facility which encourages you to want to make your payments ON TIME, because of their KIND HEARTS💗💗. They are soooo nice, you will not won't to take advantage of the Company or their kindness and professionalism. The property is ALWAYS kept clean and neat. Therefore, it encourages the renters of the facility to maintain cleanliness at all times. The other renters are friendly as well😌, when you arrive and as a lady I feel extremely safe, whether it's before closing time or early in the morning. That's important to me in this season of my life. THANK YOU Maria and Sabrina, you two are like family to me 🌹🌹🌹😌.< /Review>< rating>

<username>Russell Jones< /username><pictures>None<//pictures><Review>Maria Zamora is what makes Storage Ect. Worth coming to and doing business with! When I called corporate to inquire about their rates and terms for storage rental I was given misinformation from the corporate call center about their rates and terms; Once I arrived at the Long Beach location I was met with professionalism that I had not received from corporate. Normally it’s the other way around! I also need to add that she walked me around the facility and not only helped me, but also everyone who approached her. It was clear to me that I was not going to receive that kind of service anywhere else. She got me what I needed and got me on my way!

I’ve been to some pretty shady storage companies with shady employees who will not get off their asses to help or be attentive in anyway. But Maria was/is the way to go!

When/if Maria decides to leave Storage Ect. because the company does not see how hard she works and how great she is, me and my belongings are right behind her. ✋🎤</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dd3229464bf8f3:0x2d854fedb57f1016<//Gmap_id>< userid>

The staff have always been helpful, curtious and professional.  The storage facility is imaculate with regard to cleanliness; both inside and on the grounds, lighting; both inside and on the grounds, and accesibility to the gates, dollies and the inside and outer doors.  And, of course, the "big bopper" is I have never experienced any instances with any type of "creature" infestation. Kudos!< /Review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Very good place to wait for things, very safe and good prices. My son has a lot of time here and every time we go everything is very clean. The girls in front are very friendly and have water to drink.

(Original)
Muy buen lugar para aguardas cosas, muy seguro y buebos precios. Mi hijo tiene mucho tiempo aqui y cada vez que vamos todo esta muy limpio. Las muchachas de enfrente son muy amables y tienen agua para tomar.</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I had a dental emergency and my dental practice, whom I love, referred me to Bancroft for palliative care. My appointment started precisely on time. The two X-rays needed were the fastest and simply the clearest I’ve ever seen at such speed. It was immediately obvious that the dentist I saw was super knowledgeable about dental care as well as general health considerations. He made referrals to the more advanced services that I will require; however, totally respected my choice to return to my regular practice. Having full weekend hours and being able to almost immediately accommodate an emergency is a super plus.< /Review>< pictures>

I was in extreme pain by then, so I was surprised that I was pain free by Sunday evening! This is smart, gentle, and modern day dentistry with a pleasant and diverse team.

I also appreciated the scheduling flexibility: open 6 days a week and evenings— I didn’t have to take time off work :)< /Text>< Pictures>

I was greeted by Lupe with a sweet friendly voice who checked me in.  The extraction was very fast, Dr. Karl was so nice and made sure to explain everything to me and was very gentle.  Hands down the best dental office!!!<//Review>< gmapID>

<rating>1<//rating><text>I had quite bad experiences at Bancroft, which I went to over the course of a year. These included: 1) being over-billed—more than once, I came in and was told I owed a significant balance (once more than $1000!) and then spent twenty or thirty minutes reviewing the billing with the front of the office before they realized they'd made a mistake, 2) having a very hard time communicating with the office—they didn't necessarily return calls, I spoke to a different person every time, and information was not communicated well, 3) mistakes in the dentistry: a crown was put on incorrectly and had to be refitted entirely; when I went recently to a new dentist (in Chicago), I was told Bancroft in essence had overlooked a serious grinding problem, though I'd asked them about it on several visits; an endodontist I visited for a root canal was not happy with their choice to do three crowns at once in a sensitive part of the mouth; and so on 4) visits were hurried, there wasn't enough time to fully address questions, and lingering pain in teeth was shrugged off and 5) it proved very difficult to get an appointment, because the doctors are quite busy, delaying several procedures. I first went to Bancroft because they were the only people who could help in an emergency, and then I stuck with them, a choice I now regret. I did like some of the individual dentists and hygienists there, but I am not happy overall with the practice. If you have another choice, I advise you to go elsewhere.<//text>< pics>

<Text>Great experience that feels very save due to new CDC standards. Everyone was very nice especially the dental tech who had a fun personable bubbly personality. Some confusion for me so I will clarify here.  There's a parking lot in back. Park there because meter in front.  When you get there call and let them know. Don't go through front door as it is now the exit door. There's a side door to go in but if walking from parking lot there's another door so you'll think that's it but it its not so walk to the other door. Hope it helps<//Text>< Pictures>

This place was able to squeeze me in and remove the tooth the same day! I had zero pain during the extraction (which normally I don’t get fully numbed, but this dentist did an amazing job). They gave me an estimate before they got to work on my tooth, which was very affordable.Everyone was friendly, kind, and very efficient.

<text>Horrible experience with my children one of the workers criticized my child about her teeth, and to top it off they didn’t accept the insurance we had after kids got their teeth cleaned, X-ray all of that. Like you don’t check insurances before making appts, and before checking patients into their appts when paper work is signed 30 mins before appts.. horrible experience don’t recommend this place to anyone! I work in medical field and this was horrible experience ever!! They don’t even qualify for one star!!</text>< pictures>

<date>1600179381584</date><Rating>5</Rating><text>On Saturday, I was in dire need of attention as I had cracked my tooth in half and was uncomfortable. My wife found them Friday evening on the internet, and by great fortune they were able to see me the very next morning. The entire office had a joyous and centered energy. They had taken every precaution as far as Covid19 protections. I was beyond nervous (white coat syndrome) when I entered but quickly the wonderful staff made the tears stop. I was seen by Dr. Karl and and his assistant Laura. I was immediately put at ease by the genuine kindness and compassion they took to my plight. They were both some of the nicest people I've ever met... Honestly.
During the extraction, Laura did her absolute best to put me at ease as Dr. Karl removed my destroyed tooth. I never felt any pain, I am on my 3rd day of recovery, still never felt pain, I am greatful to his expertise.
I am amazed at how well it has gone. I am indebted to this fantastic practice just minutes from my home. I without doubt have a dental office now.

Love you guys, thank you so much. See you saturday.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808f8fa25c5ad737:0x4ae43329744642e1</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

My experience at Bancroft Dentistry has been wonderful because of the dentist, Dr. Carl Supal, who is kind and diligent. I have extreme dental anxiety but Dr. Carl has made my dental experience so very comfortable. I had to have a tooth pulled last week. I could never have had this procedure in my previous life. Please make an appt. with Dr. Carl  Supal for all of your dentistry needs.

<rate>5<//rate><text>I am amazed at the professionalism this office offers. I thought my cap on a root canal was loosened on sat. I called them on Sunday and was able to be seen the same day. Turns out I broke it at the base of the tooth. There was nothing to do with it because of where it broke. They had to extract the tooth. Dr.Karl was great. Bancroft Dental ❤ Care is a lifesaver. Looking for  great dental care,  This is the place. Thank you guys for being OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK< /text>< pics>

<Text>DISHONEST, FRAUD, or LACK OF EXPERIENCE, or all three, that almost cost me permanent damage on my tooth and thousands of dollars out of my pocket for all the dental work that I don't need.
I came here first time with the hope that the dentist can glue back my crown that fell of my tooth.
But instead of doing a simple and necessary work, the female dentist (the staff said she is Dr. Chang's wife) told me that I have to have:
1. My tooth extracted
2. Bone grafted
3. Dental implant surgery
4. Have the prosthetic crown attached to the dental implant.

She told me I can wait there and have my tooth extracted right away on the same day.
( At the end they gave me estimate of total 4 procedures they said I need to have them done with approximate cost of $3229.5 out of my pocket !!! - and this dental implant is not covered by insurance )

I was skeptical and found it hard to believe, because I did not have swelling or terrible pain had the tooth is rotten. I also have been maintaining my dentist visit/check up routine for years. I have never had any major problems on that particular tooth except for one time crown and this is the first time the crown had fallen off. So, I told them that I need a second opinion.

The staff took the Xray on my tooth and I didn't see any problem with my tooth on the Xray. The root and the tooth look fine (no cavities like what they told me).
But instead, this female dentist told me I had a collapsed bone at the very back on my jaw (which I later told by my regular trustworthy dentist, that is my jaw bone !!).
What's more, she said it is useless to glue back the crown because there isn't enough tooth to glue on since I have big cavities which is indicated by the brown stains on my tooth. The staff and this female dentist kept on pointing me to the brown stains, which indicated the tooth is rotten and have decays.
They did not even try to place the crown back and check if it fit my tooth or not.

I then visited my regular dentist, who I really trust. He gave me useful information, such as the brown stains is very normal and that could resulted from the previous fillings that left stains on the tooth. He also said he did not find any decays/cavities, and the tooth was fine.
My regular dentist did the necessary work and glued the crown back without any problem!!!

I appreciate the politeness of the staff at Bancroft Dental Care, however, my visit was a total waste of time and had I listened to this female dentist I could have her and/or her staff wreak havoc on my mouth and do permanent damage with too much work that I absolutely don't need!

All of these unnecessary procedures that I was told are quite disturbing and I really question the medical ethics and honesty of Bancroft Dental Care.</Text><Date>1614233394463</Date>< user>

<Text>Please take my advice and do not come here unless you want to be given false information just so they can take your money.

My father, an older Asian man whose first language isn't English, has been scammed. I made an appointment on behalf of him. I asked the receptionist if they accept my father's dental insurance. I believe I asked three times, stating the exact name - AETNA DMO. They said they accept it each time I asked.

I advised my father to ask the receptionist if they accept his insurance in person before he actually proceeds with the appointment. He asks Eduardo if they accept AETNA DMO. He says yes. He proceeds with the appointment and is told he has to pay out of pocket since it is Sunday and the insurance offices are closed. They tell my dad that they will contact his insurance provider for his reimbursement. Fine, makes sense....

I tell my dad to contact AETNA the next day to confirm. They tell us this office is not part of their network. Wait WHAT?!?! I'm pretty sure we asked the dental office about 4 or more times whether they accept this insurance.

Now, we call the dental office to get this resolved. We were told we would get a call back. Never was called. I called again and I explained what happened. The receptionist had the nerve to ask if we would like to schedule another appointment. Like what? No. I ask to speak to the Manager.

She transfers me to the Office Manager. Now, this is where things crumble if they haven't already. She continues to say that we misunderstood what was told to us. They accept AETNA not AETNA DMO. First off, you are insinuating that we are lying and that we do not understand what information was given to us. Is it because my father is Asian and English is not his first language? Even though he may not communicate as fast as me, I rest assure you that he understands what is being told to him. I express my discontentment and my disappointment. Isn't it your job to listen to your patients instead of defending your employees?

She says she would follow through with our insurance provider to see if they can make an exception. We never received any follow-up and now we're left with a bill that we paid for because of the misinformation that seems like was purposely given to us.

Seems like a very bad practice of a dental office to me. If you don't want to be scammed or targeted because you don't speak great English, then don't go here. To me, this is unacceptable.

Please don't respond with a generic sorry, Bancroft Dental Care. What was said and done happened and your Office Manager and the rest of the team needs a serious retraining on insurance information, discrimination, and customer service.<//Text>< Rate>

My appointment was two days ago. I’m still very much in pain. The office is located close to my house but I don’t think I won’t return to this office again.

Poor inter office communication, poor follow through, and indifference on concerns. Unfortunate considering how close they are to my home. I now drive 30 miles away to see a dentist, and it is totally worth it.

The only saving grace is the new patient coordinator. He's good, though I feel he is left to clean up everyone else's mess.

The compensation for the troubles still resulted in 1k more for braces than I was provided by another dentist. Think of this as the Kaiser of dentists. Good for managed fast care such as cleanings and xrays.< /Text>< pics>

My experience at Bancroft Dental Care during the Covid-19 situation was an amazing and seamless one. Proper precautions and excellent execution provided a safe patient experience. I had three doctors taking care of me that day. They walked me through my current dental health and answered any questions that I had. Walked out with healthier teeth and couldn’t be happier!</Review>

I was nervous going in because it had been a while to long for my teeth. But once i stepped in the office, customer service began to decline my nervousness. From ex-rays of my teeth to the completion of my procedure, the assistant and dentist made me feel secure. Im glad each of them while in school preparing for their positions studied as hard as they did and took their careers serious. Additionally, I thank the dentists and dental assistants families for their supporting them.Wonderful Job. Thank you Bancroft Dental.<//Review>< pictures>

Everyone was very friendly and skilled, and they had sensible safety protocols in place (eg having you wait in your car and get texted when it’s your turn to come in). I wish more places had thought through those policies as well as this place has!</Review>

Dr Karl extracted my mom's molar broken tooth and he did such an excellent job. He was very thorough, skillful and gentle at the same time. This was not an easy task since her tooth was broken and embedded deep in her gums and he had to ensure all the tooth fragments were removed to prevent infection. My mom is 94 years old. She stopped bleeding from the extraction site that same day.  She took one Tylenol before bed and that was it. She was not in any pain post extraction and didn't require any pain medication after one half pill of extra strength Tylenol we purchased over the counter. Although the doctor prescribed pain medication, my mom didn't need any. So shout out to Dr Karl. Also the entire staff was so nice, friendly and helpful. Thank you thank you thank you Bancroft Dental. I am so glad my friend Scott recommended this place for us!</Text>

I love Bancroft Dental Care! The staff is super friendly and quick to assist you when you come through the door. They are courteous and professional. I loved the fact that they implemented a lot of ways to keep their office and customers safe from COVID19. They have hand sanitizer stations everywhere. They check your temperature when you come in. They have someone fogging the lobby and rooms after every hour or so. They disinfect everything, even down to the pens before they hand it to you. My appointment was 5pm on a Tuesday. I am a busy workaholic mom, so  their hours of operation caters to my schedule (I love the fact that they stay open til 8pm and even open on the weekends too). When I was waiting for the doctor, the assistant Ivory kept checking in on me to make sure I was ok or if I needed anything. She was professional, knowledgeable and went above and beyond, providing exceptional customer service. I enjoyed my visit to Bancroft Dental Care and will definitely let my friends and family know.< /review>

<Review>The staff there is very nice, very informative. They’re very caring and gentle with numbing.
Up to date technology. The only problem is they don’t prescribe pain meds. Going is hard enough, knowing I’m going to be in pain is gruesome. I’m 50 years old. the pain have my BP high! I understand the epidemic, but people my age are aware of pain meds, and shouldn’t have to suffer because of it.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Office is very clean and modern. Office hours are very convenient.  EVERYONE from office staff, assistants, dentists and billing clerks are all so nice and helpful too. I’m an anxious person and going to the dentist is at the bottom of my to do list but this staff is amazing, patient, understanding and they move at my pace and are always checking in with me before and during procedures. I have had 2 cleanings, a deep cleaning and  2 crowns (Dr. G is wonderful) since I’ve been a patient there.  Overall, Wonderful office.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x808f8fa25c5ad737:0x4ae43329744642e1<//Gmap_id>< Rating>

Best experience at a dental care office. Everyone was really welcoming and nice. The process was quick - cleaning & exam within an hr. The equipment they used were gental - I didn't squirm or had to fight thru the process as usual. Actually could relax.< /review>

Great experience! Office is nice and clean staff members are nice, make you feel comfortable and nicely guide you through the procedure. I’m not gonna lie I was shaking while sitting on the chair thinking of how painful it was gonna be get a molar pulled out. Doctor had a soft hand I didn’t even feel the needle poking me during the numbing procedure. I recommend this place %100

Thank you Bancroft Dental< /Review>

I was in so much pain due to a cracked failed tooth. They somehow we're able to fit me in at 10 today. They are really making sure that there is covid testing and ensuring everyones safety. All the staff were extremely friendly and they walked me through the whole process of getting my tooth extracted. They also help me out and getting a bone graft to start for a tooth implant as well. I truly appreciate them seeing me under such a short notice and I feel immensely better.  I commend their professionalism, courtesy and dental work!!!< /Review>

I am giving the staff and dentist at Bancroft Dental Care the highest rating because of their professional and caring manner. I had an emergency appointment during Shelter in Place and they followed strict sanitary precautions throughout the visit. Josie, dental assistant was thorough and congenial,, Dr. Petrugh assessed my dental problem, prescribed helpful antibiotics and referred me to a specialist in root canals. I highly recommend them.<//Text>

Horrible place wasted 3 hrs of my time for no reason. They have terrible communication skills. I ended paying for a service I couldn't even receive and currently have to wait for a refund. It was such a pathetic experience that I ended going to Walgreens after the appointment and filed my own tooth down since the doctor would not listen to me and didn't care that I was in pain because of my front left tooth being way too long. It was the best decision to just spend the $13 to file my own tooth. Im no longer in pain and I can finally eat correctly. Its pathetic that they would allow someone to be in pain and look aesthetically unpleasing when they could simply just have taken 2 minutes to fix it. Its almost evil and sinister and I wouldn't recommend this place at all. Also arrived on time for my appointment and didn't actually see the doctor until a hr and a half later. Ridiculous and he didn't listen to my needs at all, it almost sounded like he was mocking me. Just a horrible place!!<//Text>

Dr. S and his staff were great! He said the shot would not hurt and he was right. He got me numb with 1 shot- usually others have had to do at least 2. He was very fast but gentle. The office is clean, very efficient and having Maryanne in office to go over finances is great as well. She was able to look at my dental insurance online and tell me exactly what my coverage was before even starting a procedure. The staff seemed to work very well together. I did not get the name of the dental assistant who worked on me- but she was very on the ball-! Kudos!! They have their own parking lot which is very convenient- not to mention their awesome hours for those of us who work!< /text>

Called them on a Sunday to make an appointment. From point of contact to when I got my molar removed, the experience was pleasant.

Painless procedure and good customer service.

I’d recommend to family and friends.

<text>I find them to be very professional. A pleasant atmosphere. Doctor P goes above and beyond to explain to you exactly what needs to be done. Making sure that you have all prescriptions that you need for pain if necessary. The plus side is you will receive a appointment reminder on the same day I rate them 5 star.< /text>< Pictures>

This dentist is awesome I felt really comfortable. Dr. Chang was great with all his patience and knowledge I love how he explained everything to me in a way I understood. I never liked going to the dentist but my experience there made me feel at ease about coming back. My daughter and I now go to Bancroft dental.

Went in with butterflies because I was getting a crown done and it was easy. No pain at all nerves bad for no reason.  I felt 0 pain.<//review>

I had my temperature taken, and sanitize my hands. The reception area though small, was set up for social distancing. I visited this office because I have a broken front tooth, as a result of eating ribs during 4 July. Anyway, I met with Dr. Karl. Dr. Karl presented very well, this is not real fear of the dentist. Further, Dr. Karl got right to the point, about financial ability; he gave me the good the bad and the ugly per se. I really appreciate this  direct approach.
Sorry this is so long.  I had to just give you some detail. But I would strongly recommend this office. I would recommend this office because of their professionalism, cleanliness, and ability to do business and is very real scary environment call Covid 19. Everyone from the receptionist, to the x-ray person, to financial intake person was just wonderful. Thank you Bancroft Dental, I will do my best to get back there and get this work done.

I was in so much pain it was unbearable. I was desperate for relief. One call is all it took and the very next morning i was scheduled for an appointment early in the morning. Unfortunately my tooth couldn't be saved ,the doctor fully understood my anxiety. She was fast and most importantly gentle. Thank you Bancroft Dental.< /Text>< pictures>

I was seen in In February for wisdom tooth they gave me antibiotics for the pain for my tooth and I develop coronavirus in these people can even help me with the same problem that I was dealing with before in February they are telling me that I need to go to Highland Hospital when I’m in quarantine how Inconsiderate and not good service.And when I called on Friday they said the doctor will call me back and the doctor didn’t my call back  it is Tuesday and still no response I had to call them back. Very poor customer Service.It’s all because I have coronavirus and I am a healthcare provider and they couldn’t even take care of me I am not a Highland patient I belong to kaiser  they didn’t even try to accommodate me or help me out with the situation.</text>

Dr. Mike and Francisco worked quickly and professionally to make one temporary crown and complete four veneer fillings within a 1.5-hour appointment, and the permanent crown will be ready within 7 business days. Dr. Mike is an expert in local anaesthesiology, too, I was numbed quickly and 100% effectively, did not feel any pain during the procedure.

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Had an accident and broke a crown that was installed by another (better) dentist. Dr. Carl tells me what a great job the other dentist did and precedes to grind away more of my teeth without discussing it with me first. Then, after the fact, tells me he raised them higher into my gums. I didn’t think anything of it at the time. It’s been two weeks now since the permanent crown has been installed. I have bleeding gums and sensitivity to cold water now, something I didn’t have with my old crown.  It is extremely difficult to properly floss now. While flossing it’s painful, bleeds, there’s jagged edges above the gum line that have been trapping bacteria. All of which I didn’t have with my previous crown.  With my old crown flossing was smooth as if I was flossing actual teeth. What a hack job. I don’t really understand his arrogance for grinding away what the previous dentist did, even though he said it was a great job. Perhaps he wanted to justify the $3300 cost as more than just cementing a new one in. I can only hope the pain and gum bleeding doesn’t last a life time, and the jagged edges where gum meets tooth doesn’t lead to bad breath and decay issues for me in the future. Thanks.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Today was wonderful at Bancroft Dental.  I was there for a regular cleaning.  Yvette was the hygienist who cleaned my teeth.  Yvette and her assistant were wonderful towards me.     They both took the time to explain everything to me.  Compared to other not so cool incidents, I am very pleased, and my teeth feel great!!!< /Review>

Our family have been patients since late 70’s. Always takes time to talk and I can ask any question regarding care of my teeth.

On December 3rd I went in for a cleaning. I waited in my car when arriving until it was clear for me to enter the offices. One door entry, the other door to exit.  I felt very safe inside with the social distancing and everyone wiping everything down.   I have been a patient for over 40 years and would highly recommend Bancroft Dental to anyone who asks.<//Review>

I had a dental emergency that began on Sunday.  I called my usual dentist and left several messages and had no response so I drove to both offices and they were closed. A friend referred me to Bancroft Dental and when I called at 9:30 they set me up for an appt at 11:40, diagnosed the broken root and made sure I had an emergency plan in place if it became worse or the swelling spread. Unable to pull the tooth due to swelling they are monitoring me carefully and checking me again today. Forever grateful for the immediate service and excellent care.</Review>

I am very unpleased with the office manager. I received work without an estimate a few years ago just before the year was out. This was an attempt to Max out both my insurance.

I was told I was covered for the work completed. However, a year later I received a bill for over a $1000.

I went to clean my teeth every quarter and I was never informed of an outstanding bill. When I brought it to their attention, they could not find the records of the communication. No signed documents.

I am truly frustrated by their lack of professionalism.</text>

I am a new patient. My experience so far has been great. The office is in constant communication and sends appointment reminders like no other (if you sign up of course) so this helps my husband and I so we don't forget about our scheduled appointments. Everyone I've met since my first appointment has been very helpful in making sure that I understand what is going on and what is best for my dental care and I thank you for that Bancroft Dental Care & Staff! I expect all my visits to be as pleasant as the first.< /review>

The staff at Bancroft Dental are VERY friendly and professional!!! This office is EXTREMELY awesome with its high tech, immaculate, infection controlled, homey atmosphere with pricing that is fare and considerate to the patients-not to mention the convenient parking. This is the perfect dental office in my opinion!

Open evenings and weekends is what attracted me to this office. I said to myself, " This office cares a great deal about the patients continuity and availability which is a brilliant business strategy". Caught my attention.

And, the doctor has an amazing, cool swag that will capture your attention and have you ready for a dental adventure-you kinda forget that going to the dentist sucks.

As a licensed practitioner and mom, I HIGHLY recommend this office for your entire family.<//review>

He recommended that I put caps on two of my teeth due to "the most severe grinding he has ever seen in someone my age". The decision seemed off and rushed to me, so I declined to receive the procedure and he became very angry. I got a second opinion from another dental office and they said they would never recommend putting caps on my teeth. I have read other reviews that echo experiences like this. The office seems like they are trying to get money out of you, and I would warn everyone against going here. The one star is for the dental assistants though, who are okay but seemed terrified of Mike Chang.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
The service here is excellent. Latest technology, very clean location, and kind/professional staff. My daughter and I were seen at the same time. They even do braces in-house, which for a working mom is very convenient. Did I mention evening and weekend appointments? Honestly, I don’t know how this place isn’t completely booked. Highly recommend this dental office.</Review>

< Review>
I had to get major dental work done! Dr.karl was EXCELLENT. He did 4 crowns and was super gentle, attentive and fast. I have extreme anxiety when going to the dentist  but he put me at ease by making me comfortable throughout the procedure. The staff are professional and kind, the office is clean and inviting (beautiful fish tank with Dori and Nemo's lol words from my 5 year old) there's also a decent amount of parking including a small lot behind the office. Super easy to find and centrally located . 5 star place! Dr.Karl you rock!< /Review>

<Review>This was the best experience I have had at a  dentist in over 40 years.  The staff are very polite and they truly want to help you.  My hygienist Tatum was incredible and informative.  She administered the shots and deep cleaned my teeth with little or NO DISCOMFORT, I never felt pain with her.  Thank you Tatum  .I would recommend her in a heartbeat.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808f8fa25c5ad737:0x4ae43329744642e1</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

These dentists here are so good at what they do that I damn near fell asleep during a root canal! Made me feel a lot better about being in a dentist chair getting work done that I have no worries about going back in to get the rest of my work done.

Would definitely recommend to anyone!</review>

I never have to wait. They get me right in. They make sure im comfortable the whole time. They helped me figure out a plan that I can afford. They are open 7 days a week so they are always willing to work with your schedule. Im so thankful I found them.</text>< Pictures>

The staff are  cheery and wonderful and so helpful in calming my nerves (I hate dentist offices) and they were so patient with me and sat with me on what my insurance would cover and what were the specific costs for the little procedures they were recommending for me.

Before going to Bancroft Dental, I had and excruciating toothache. I telephoned the dentist's office and explained what was going on; the receptionist gave me an appointment right away which was the next day, a Saturday. I went to the appointment and filled out paperwork. Xrays were taken by a dental assistant. She was so pleasant. She explained the procedures  I saw the dentist he said that I had a few problems and I had a choice of what I wanted to get done with the tooth. The entire appointment only lasted about an hour. I was given dark glasses to put on so the light wouldn't bother my eyes. The atmosphere and people we're very friendly. I will be returning in the future to fix the rest of my teeth. I recommend Bancroft Dental for all of your dental needs.</text>

<Time>1562640482275</Time><Rating>5</Rating><review>I love the convenience of their schedule, the fact it's right around the corner from my house, and even though I'm a new member, they've taken care of me and gotten straight to work.

They quickly put me at ease despite having avoided the Dentist office like the plague prior to going to Bancroft Dental (luckily I got off relatively easily all things considered).

Typically any sort of medical or dental setting isn't really my jam, making me even more squirrely than normal, but the owner was so confident and quick through the whole process I was in and out before I even knew it.

I swear he could get himself a gig at NASCAR on a pit crew if he ever gets bored with being a Dentist.  After my interactions with Bancroft Dental as a whole thus far, I have zero reservations about continuing my upkeep in a much more regular fashion for perhaps the first time in my life.<//review>< pictures>

I'm very comfortable here. Always treated well by all the staff.  I don't have a dental plan, so use the one they provide.  It includes discounts, so good for seniors, too.  I guess I've been coming here for over 20 years now.<//Review>

I absolutely love this dentist office. The staff id so polite and relatable. I get so much anxiety over going to the dentist and they helped me feel much better and at ease. They are open everyday and don’t recommend all kinds of extra work be done on you just because they feel like it. (I’ve had that happen to me) the office is clean and they are very prompt. This is my new dentist now! And I’m very happy about that.<//Text>

Dr Chang gives pertinent advice and informs me of my daughter's dental health; he noticed my daughters adenoids were abmormally big and gave a recommendation to see an ear nose and throat specialist. I am always impressed at the professionalism with heart displayed here every time I or my girls have appointments. They are awesome!

After 14 years, I am still impressed with the family approach, efficiency, state of the art technology, and follow through with Bancroft Dental Care. I received a crown today, perfectly fitted. Dr. Chang knows his stuff!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

My experiences with the doctor's(dentists) and staff has been so warm, welcoming and professional. I'm in the process of saving my teeth and getting implants for the others and it's been such a smooth ride for me since my anxiety level at the dentist goes up and up. The support staff is amazing too. I definitely recommend Bancroft Dental.<//Text>

My first review was 2 years ago. Dr. Chang and his team continue to provide excellent services. It almost makes me happy to go see the dentist... [2 years ago] Superior service by Dr. Chang. Customer service excellent by all staff. Finance department goes out of the way to assist you and ensure you understand the billing process.</Text>

<review>Moved to the East Bay and needed to find a new dentist. I found this dental practice and decided to give them a try. My experience so far has been great, receptionist, dental assistant, hygienist and dentist. However, only had a cleaning, exam and x-rays on this first visit. I have follow up appointment for minor and serious work later. Further critiques to follow.</review>< Rate>

<Review>I am glad that they have an early enough appointment so that my visit doesn't interrupt my working day.

I am into technology and I notice that they have gadgets like a new fangled x-ray machine which makes taking x-rays faster and easier. Their use of the latest technology is impressive.

Also the front staff is really nice and professional. Ms. Kendra blessed my day so much that I just had to give her a holiday basket.< /Review>< pics>

This place is the best. Their hours are perfect for everyone. They have really early appointments, like 6 am and really late appointments. The staff are beyond friendly. They treat you with kindness and respect the minute you walk in. There's never any judgement. They are all very professional. I don't see myself leaving this place.<//review>

They came highly recommended. I was told last year I needed a root canal and that experience was not good.  Unfortunately, when the dentist was injecting the novocaine, he hit a nerve. I almost jumped out of the chair.  They say it can happen but that was a first for me.  I still get that numbing sensation at time.  Outside of that experience, Bancroft Dental is a good place for dental servicing.<//Text>

<review>I've had many horrible experiences getting dental work done and every time I go in, I'm so incredibly nervous and anxious. Dr. G at Bancroft Dental is absolutely amazing and did everything she could to make sure I was comfortable. I got a lot of dental work done and had zero pain or discomfort. I really appreciate her going above and beyond to take my anxiety away.</review>< Rate>

1st experience wasn't the best as I felt like I was just marketed to the whole time. My teeth cleaning was awful and I had to ask them to redo it. Second time they really made up for the first time.

I love that their is diversity, organization, financial options, etc. It about time a dental office had in house insurance as well, happy to see these things.

Since my first experience they have put me with an awesome dentist and really done a great job.</text>

Everyone is so friendly, helpful and the environment is peaceful.

Dr. Mike was awesome, he took alot of time to share with me the needs I have and my options. I also noticed how they took pride in the office environment in being clean and hand hygiene awareness. They also have state of the art equipment.

The downside is it's a bit pricey so I hope at the end it's worth it.</text>

Personalized service, with a Smile! I appreciate the personal greeting by Connie upon entering and attention to details given by  Armenia of my dental needs, and professional explanation of services needed by Dr. Tero, and last,  but not Least, a thorough explanation of all associated costs, and affordability plans! I must say, in today’s world of consumerism, it’s hard to beat this kind of service! Thanks<//review>

I came here after not going to the dentist for a few years.  They had some bad news for me :( , but the staff was very nice.  Dr. Sheila was great and took care of me.  She had a very gentle injection technique and you will barely feel a thing.  I'll definitely be back in 6 months for my checkup.< /Review>

I met Mary Ann at my Union Meeting in June.  Had she not been persistent in trying in gettingmy attention, I would not have approached her table where she sat advertising Bancroft Dental Care. She is very professional and kind hearted. July 19, 2018, I had a deep cleaning procedure with Onica who was fabulous at her job. I appreciate her patience with me as she took the time to explain the procedure and asked any questions that I had. I have already referred people to Bancroft Dental Care.<//review>

<review>In my opinion, this is the best dental office!!!  They made "going to the dentist" a very pleasant experience. Everyone is great and the all of the dentist are extremely knowledgeable.  If your looking for a new dentist and are wondering if you should use them as your dentist, take it from me. Give them a call and experience yourself. They are very gental.</review>< pics>

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!  I hateeeee going to the dentist but somehow Bancroft Dental made it an easy and pleasant experience.  The office is extremely well kept and filled with amazing staff and doctors.  Alexis performed my cleaning with ease and made me feel comfortable the entire time.

After my cleaning and examination, I found out I had minor cavities and slightly puffy gums.  Instead of shoving unnecessary cleanings, or any extra services down my throat, the doctor allowed me to go home and be proactive with my teeth.  Anyone looking for an efficient and painless trip to the dentist should visit Bancroft Dental!!< /review>

The doctors really care about their clients. I came in with an abscessed tooth that needed to be extracted and they made sure I got the proper care. They followed up with me about taking anti biotics and making sure I was ok leading up to the procedure. They made me feel the most comfortable during the procedure and before I knew it, the tooth was out. Didn’t feel a thing! Thank you Dr. R and Dr. P for your care!</review>

<date>1554145754545</date><rating>1< /rating><text>One star is honestly too generous for this dental office. Dr. G IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST DENTIST AND THE HYGIENIST BY THE NAME OF JUDY WAS UNDENIABLY THE WORST COMBINATION EVER. I just relocated to California, and I decided to check out this office because of the positive reviews. When I say that I have never in my life experienced such subpar treatment please take me seriously and literally. My entire visit with every interaction with the staff was ridiculous and unprofessional. The receptionist didn’t even properly greet me. She instead handed me some forms to fill out, and she verbally asked me repetitive questions that I had already filled out on the form. Due to her incompetence and downtright laziness, I had a prolonged process when it was time for me to leave. The hygienist that did my cleaning communicated very poorly. As she was cleaning my teeth, she made an appoint to attempt to inform me about my previous dental history although she knew nothing about me. I was telling her of the ongoing problems that I have been having and unsolicitedly and aggressively mentions that my underlying problems have been due to negligence on my dentist part. Again, I’m a new patient and she knows absolutely nothing about my previous care to make bold and incorrect claims. She then proceeds to give me a diagnosis for the problems that I’ve been experiencing, and I ask her does she have the proper education and licensing to support her conclusions. The hygienist says nothing besides “I don’t sugar coat things”. At this point, I am truly not believing what is taking place. Dr. G comes in with no introduction and instead is more focused on generating revenue for the office and talks about Invisalign options. She spent more time discussing invisalign than my current issues that had brought me in. I actually had to be the initiator in the conversation and ask her if abc is the reason for abc, and she responded using dental jargon that the ordinary person doesn’t know. The entire time she’s unclear, brief, and uncooperative. At this point, I’m exhausted from prying information out of her so I don’t say anything else. Judy comes back and is confused about what the next steps are and she even asks me for my opinion. I told her that I’m not the dentist, so I obviously do not know how to best tackle the treatment plan. All the way around it was evident that the hygienist and Dr. G do not communicate effectively if at all. Dr. G comes back and tell her that xyz exam is required for all new patients, and Judy responded by saying that it slipped her mind. I could truly go on and on, but all the way around DO NOT GO HERE. THE ABSOLUTE WORST DECISION THAT I MADE WAS TRUSTING THESE PEOPLE TO DO THE BARE MINIMUM.<//text>< pics>

I walked in Bancroft Dental office without an appointment and having never been there before. It was noon and they said that I could be seen by a dentist at 1pm. So by 1:39pm I was in my car and on my way home - I already had completed the new patient forms, had xrays of the tooth causing my pain and I had seen the dentist.

Unfortunately, I was told my tooth was going to need to be extracted. (I knew that was going to be the case - so I was prepared to hear that bad news). My appointment was two days later at 10am.... and to my amazement I was out of there by 10:45am. All done. YES! So happy!!

Staff is very nice. This dental office is great all they was around. AND the dentist was so good that I felt nothing n-o-t-h-I-n-g no pain at all when he gave me the novacaine injections!! AWESOME.... Thank you Bancroft Dental.

I live just around the corner from Bancroft dental so I called them to see if they would be able to get me in the next day or two. They were actually able to get me in that same evening. The staff at the office were all so welcoming and very nice. Every person in the office welcomed me with a hand shake and a smile. The dentist who treated me smoothed out the broken tooth for me and the staff set me up with their endodontist to perform a root canal just 2 days later. They were all so amazing and understanding. Dr. Anderson performed the root canal. I have had 2 Root canals prior to this and dr. Anderson did the best job by far. She was very efficient and concerned with my comfort. She continuously checked in with me regarding pain. I would definitely recommend Bancroft dental to my friends and family.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I truly enjoy going to Bancroft Dental, which is unusual since I have never looked forward to going to the dentist. Everyone is polite, professional, and excellent at what they do. They are also very patient with my needs (letting me do dental work in stages). I plan on continuing to use them as my dentist as long as they are around.</Review>

Update 10/2/18: Still love this place and Denise, the finance lady, is the best at explaining benefits and telling you want needs to be done BEFOREHAND. Don’t be shy to let them know what you’re going through financially because Denise will find a way to help. The only thing i can recommend on improvement is the constant phone calls and texts just to confirm an appointment. Even if you reply with a text, they still call you the same day about 3x.

Original post:
I've been coming here on and off for about 7 years.  Reason behind that is insurance changes.  I love the fact that dr. Taro knows me as a person and not as just some patient. They really take the time to make you feel welcomed.  Did i mention they have massage chairs now? !? I literally took a 20 min nap the whole time i was getting a filing done last week,  haha!< /text>

<text>From my own experience, my family's experience and other experiences I have heard of, this office will over diagnose conditions you may barely have, and charge you out of house and home. I went in for a routine cleaning with no complaints, and they gave me fillings. One filling they put in was sensitive and they did a bite test but since I couldn't pinpoint the pain they left it. 5 years later I've had the same sensitivity. I had a dentist change the filling because it was cracked and what she found was disturbing, that the hole bancroft scraped out of my tooth went too close to the nerve and as a result I may need a root canal. My dentist said there's no way I could have had a cavity that deep without pain. Whats more, because the hole is so big the filling cracked and is likely to keep cracking. Go here if you like, but make sure you get a second opinion. They want your money and don't really care about your teeth.<//text><resp>None</resp><rating>1<//rating><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

<name>Psyborg Punk< /name><Text>They're not there to help people with no insurance. They want to rip you off when you don't have insurance. A little lie can expose these guys. They'll kiss your butt for good reviews though. A lot of money put into decorating the office but that doesn't fool me. "Oh man, the doctor's is giving back to the community, it's going to cost ya 3000 dollars for a crown without insurance" lmao.  I had it done for 200 in San Jose.
Not that i can't afford it, I mean, I made 30 mil from bitcoins. It's just that I don't like to be disrespected. I'm against making shady people richer.</Text>< Response>

< Review>
After searching for a dentist for months I finally went to Bancroft Dental Care. Great service and great staff, but unfortunately what seemed to be great hours are not and sadly I found this out after my visit when they recommended a deep cleaning, I agreed and tried to schedule an appointment, but it turns out they only provide that type of service between 9 a.m. - 3 p.m. M-F. Which is a bummer because of my work schedule, so even though they are open extended hours 7 days a week, be aware that is not always for the service you may need, if you have an idea what you might need and have a tight schedule, ask prior to your visit. I defiantly like and will  recommend this place.</Review>

Found this place a few years back. My kids live them they have been taking care of there teeth since 3 I believe now 8 and 5 yrd old. They look foward to going. When they leave they know they always a new toothbrush and paste, a little toy and yes they have apple juice there reward for being good patients. The place is clean and they all know who you are from the front desk to doctors. Most important they calm your nerves. Love this place..warm and happy feeling whole your there.< /text>

This establishment is very welcoming, the environment is relaxing, and the staff is awesome! Being at a dental office has never felt so up-lifting. From the music, to the decorations, and not to mention how friendly the staff is. I will definitely recommend this place to a friend and/or family.<//Text>

<name>Thao Tran< /name><Time>1518734712818</Time><rating>1<//rating><Text>I didnt trust this place the moment the doctor said I needed a crown. The dentist I had before said I only needed to replace my filling, which was cracked. The staff (front desk, DA, hygienists) were very friendly but it doesn't change the fact that this place operates as a BUSINESS as opposed to looking out for the best interests of their patients. A month later, I went to another dental office (Laurel Smile) to get another opinion and as I suspected, I did NOT need a crown. I've had 2 different reputable dentists that said I only needed a filling replaced; meanwhile, this practice made it seem like I was in dire need of a crown since my tooth was "decaying." Mind you, I feel no discomfort, sensitivity, or pain. It disgusts me to know businesses exist to make money and recommend unnecessary procedures. Find yourself an honest business - do NOT go here.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>My family and I have been going to BDC since before it was BDC. In the 50's, it was Dr. Milton. In the 60's-70's, it was Dr. Goodrich. After that, Dr. Chang, who then turned it into Bancroft Dental. He and his staff have turned a traditional dentists office into a state-of-the-art practice, with all the technology that a patient could ask for. And their staff is still as down home as ever. Couldn't be more pleased!< /Review></record>

My experience was extra-ordinary. I've never witnessed such an outstanding reception from the receptionist and all of the other staff members including the dentist. I felt I had found another extension of my family that I never known but felt like I've known forever.  The work that was done on my mouth was temporary but yet I felt comfortable enough leaving until I come back to complete the procedure.  I look forward to going back and having future work done.<//Text>

<Review>Went in anxious. Left reassured. Complex, lingering dental concerns; coupled with insurance issues. Front office staff, dental assistant Michelle, Dr. Wong and even the insurance clerk MaryAnne/Mary Ellen (sorry forgot her name) were friendly and accommodating. I am not always the easiest to deal with in this kind of environment. Clean office, complimentary coffee and confident staff that listens. I ramble at times. Thanks EVERYONE!!  I think I can sleep now :-)

UPDATE June 18, 2018: Dr. Janice ROCKS!!! She is honest, non judgemental, knowledgeable and about provides her patients with options. I admire her straight forwardness and ability to move forward in an attempt to reach the goal. Surgery #2 because the doctor wants to see this thing through...me too!  To be continued..

UPDATE Feb 27, 2021: Bancroft is still Rocking!!! Connie the Office manager is always ON POINT!!! Responsive and professional. Called me right back after I left a message about the BUSY Sunday Feb 21st (YES a SUNDAY) to have a cleaning and a tooth extracted.

Bancroft adheres to COVID guidelines and even request you wait in the car until called. "Yvette" the hygienist was friendly and heard my concerns about the cold water on my very sensitive teeth. She was gentle and used minimal water (only to rinse) on my teeth...GREATLY appreciated!!!

Next up, the extraction and Dr.Karl (who I later found out was working alone that day) would be with me in 10, maybe 15 minutes.  No worries. Like Dr. Janice, he is confident and seasoned which makes me feel very comfortable...I'll wait.

10 mins, at 20 mins "Denise" came to check on me to see if I wanted to watch a movie? I told her that my xrays on the screen before me looked like something out of a Horror movie, so I was good...dosing off actually.

30 mins, "Denise" asked if I wanted a blanket because I think I was snoring? At 50 mins, I inquired how much longer as I could hear Dr. Karl wrapping up another patient. 60 mins, I begin to leave the exam room and head to the front greeted by Yvette and Denise to apologize further for the delay. It was a Sunday (my only off day), the doctor was hustling alone , I got a power nap in, so rescheduling seemed best.

They displayed concern and apologized multiple times. It was the attention they showed during this awkward situation that merited a continued 5 STARS!!!  I will be back in early March to finish up!!! :-))<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I was in a Hugh amount of pain, when my wife call Bancroft dental last night. They told her there is a 5:45 pm appointment open. So I ran down there to get this Hugh pain in my mouth taken care of since my regular dentist sold his business last year.
The receptionist was very polite, I fill out all my insurance information and waited. Finally i'm up. the office looks clean, and the tech was very nice, took an xray and said the tooth is broken, I said i'm in a lot of pain that's why I made an emergency appointment. Then dentist came and said to come back tomorrow. Told me to go talk to there finance counselors. remember I'm in a lot of pain and Bancroft got me to come down LATE last night just to fill out my ability to PAY.  Well FYI I thought that what an insurance card is for.
Now I am at kaiser Emergency at 230 am in the morning  to get medication to stop the pain in mouth which Bancroft Dental should have taken care of with the 5:45 pm emergency appointment.
The receptionist called my wife and told her thy can take me in the morning. This is the morning an guess what I'm in Kaiser Emergency.
don't go with the first flyer you see in the mail that day or else you end up like me!!!< /Text>

<review>Dr. Tero is such a great dentist. She informs you on everything you need to know relating to your visit, gives you options and most importantly is very patient. Dr. Tero and the entire staff are such kind and caring people, I will continue to refer all my friends and family.</review>< pics>

I just happened upon this place after leaving an earlier dental appointment which unfortunately wasn't able to help me. So Im driving towards home and I see BDC. I decided to go in. The staff is warm and welcoming and great customer service. Sooo glad I happened upon there. They fit me into the schedule, I got xrays in 10 mins. Spoke with the dentist, she let me know my options. The dental assistant was gentle. I really appreciated that and she made me feel comfortable. The place is clean and the staff has great customer service. Soooo glad I happened upon there!</Text>

Needless to say when you go to Bancroft Dental care always seek a 2nd opinion, because they will fabricate a minor problem into a major one! I never needed 2 crowns only a filling..< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Nothing recommended I have stuck my teeth more and more until I need an implant. They made me crowns that didn't look good. I used a retainer and they knew and after the crowns the retriever was no more. He promised a new one for free and they didn't do it well, they promised to change it and never put the order in when they had said it was ready in less than two weeks. Now they bring me back and forth until I get tired to not repair anything. Nothing professional I do not recommend it for NOTHING ZERO

(Original)
Nada recomendable me han clavado mis dientes cada vez más hasta necesitar de un implante. Me hicieron unas coronas que no quedaron buen. Yo usaba retenedor y ellos sabían y después de las coronas el retrnedor no quedaba mas. Prometió uno nuevo gratis y no lo hicieron bien, prometieron cambiarlo y nunca metieron la orden cuando habían dicho que estaba listo en menos de dos semanas. Ahora me traen a vuelta y vuelta hasta cansarme para no reparar nada. Nada profesional. No lo recomiendo para NADA CERO< /Review>
