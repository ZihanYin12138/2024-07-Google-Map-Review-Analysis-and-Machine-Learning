Took my wife on a date night to eat sushi and watch the sunset nearby. The rolls here are amazing. The specialty roll selection is very limited, however the few they have are all very good. The fish in the rolls is top notch. Look forward to the day I can sit in the restaurant and enjoy the atmosphere. The rolls are worth every dollar.</Review>

Probably the best sashimi I've had so far in SD. Unimposing storefront in a small shopping plaza with it's own parking lot - though limited parking outside per usual of downtown La Jolla.

Can't describe the sashimi except that you must come and try for yourself! Pleasant outdoor patio of sorts for all your COVID friendly needs.< /Text>

Great place for sushi on weekdays. Weekends it gets very busy so get a reservation ahead of time.

One of my two favorite sushi spots in SD. I believe these guys once worked at Ota too, or they are owned by the same company.<//text>

Get the omakase and don't think twice about it. Excellent quality in a wonderful setting. Would highly recommend!< /Text>

Friendly staff, great food. The Treasure Bowl has most of what you want already in it and is pretty sizeable. Chicken karaage bowl is amazing and a go-to of you don't like raw fish. One of the few places in San Diego that actually serve REAL wasabi.< /Text>

<Review>Secret. This may not be a secret amongst many sushi lovers but himitsu is Fantastic! Located in La Jolla this little gem boasts one of my favorite omakase in San Diego. Choosing your tea cup or sake cup is also an interesting experience to add to the atmosphere.< /Review><gmapID>0x80dc03e376700407:0xe6521b675eaa605</gmapID><Date>1606870523862< /Date></record></dataset><record>

I would recommend making a reservation as it’s easy to spend a couple hours enjoying good company in their cozy outdoor setting, eating delicious and fresh sushi and drinks served with much attention to detail.

We tried to go impromptu for late lunch when we arrived in La Jolla and all their tables were either half way through their meal or reserved so we decided to come back another time; let me tell you that making a reservation was a breeze and the staff was super courteous over the phone.

The portions are smaller but typical of a more upscale restaurant and everything is top quality; to name a few, the toro melts in your mouth, the scallops have a delicate flavor and the warm miso makes you feel right at home.  Our server was sincerely friendly and knowledgeable about the fish they were serving that night. If you’re drinking sake, you get to choose your own cup, which is a lot of fun, and our server was even knowledgeable about what kind of cup was better for what kind of sake.
I also loved how the chef thanks you for coming in Japanese as you’re leaving. We had a great experience at Himitsu!<//Text>

We decided to do the omakase. The majority of the dishes were all amazing. The fish was excellent. The lack of 5 stars for me was we also asked for a sake pairing and it wasn't really a pairing just a bunch of sake picked by the server with no guide on what goes with what. The other issue I personally had was raw baby squid. Not great, not something that should be served. The other down side was we had to order an extra roll as the $170 per person chefs choice wasn't enough food. The roll was outstanding though. Next time we go here we will order off the menu so we have better control of the meal.</text>

Where you can find authentic, extremely fresh and tasty sushi. With too much attention to the details and precisely wrapped, each roll is a piece of art.
Thank you for your great service Himitsu!<//Text>

< Review>
Himitsu is a quaint restaurant in La Jolla Cove serving high-end sashimi and nigiri alongside a compact menu of small plates and rolls. My visits to Himitsu have provided a generous amount of excellent sushi, and a warm experience that has rivaled my sushi experiences in Tokyo. The space consists of an outdoor patio and a handful of sushi bar seats which you should hope to reserve when dining here. A strong social vibe pervades the small sushi bar, isolated in its own intimate solarium where one has the opportunity to know their chef and fellow diners.

Behind the sushi bar is Chef Mitsu Aihara, formerly of Sushi-Ota. If you are fortunate enough to sit at the sushi bar and have Chef Mitsu attend to you personally, you MUST order the omakase, as Chef Mitsu delivers one of the best and most innovative omakase experiences in San Diego, proving to be similarly skilled to his mentor, Chef Ota. A friendly character with a natural ability to effortlessly create Instagram-able food porn, Chef Mitsu takes the time to know the diner he is serving and customizes the omakase experience for that person -- I noticed I was getting slightly different sushi than he was serving the couple next to me who were also doing omakase. The fish came out fast-and-furious and, two hours into it, I finally needed to tap out after being served an ultra-rich hand roll containing uni, "melt-in-your-mouth" otoro, and salmon roe, for what seemed like my 25th course in.

Much of Himitsu's fish is flown in overnight from Japan, though some of it is locally-caught as well. A few of my favorites that aren't as popular at other sushi joints in San Diego included the buttery "Black Throat Sea Perch" and the naturally sweet "Triggerfish," topped with its own white, sticky liver when served nigiri-style.

As other reviews have noted, Chef Mitsu loves Japanese sardines, here served as both nigiri and sashimi, somewhat fatty and slippery in texture and with a clean but concentrated flavor of fish. This is a unique piece of sushi I've not had elsewhere that reminded me of Red Boat 40°N, a favorite fish sauce in my household.

Mid-way through my omakase, I was offered Shirako, which Chef Mitsu described as "an appetizer, like eggs." Since I've had Shirako before, I shot back, "don't you mean sperm?", and so ended the ruse, as my fellow diners at the bar all soured their faces at once, and I enjoyed my cod sperm sacs, here served raw in a ponzu sauce -- its creamy white blobs sharing both the texture and taste of the fried belly parts of whole belly fried clams, but without the deep-fried batter.

Other sushi I've had here has included Otoro, Chutoro, Marinated Blue Fin Akami, Local Spiny Lobster, Salmon Belly, Hamachi Belly, Uni, Stripejack, Raw Squid, Seared Squid with Shiso and Eel Sauce, Needlefish, Octopus, Razor Clam, Albacore, Ocean Eel, Kelp-Marinated Halibut, and Wagyu Beef. All have been served fresh and, at minimum, have met my expectations. Additionally, I've ordered the "Salmon Jalapeño," similar to Nobu's famous "Hamachi Jalapeño," but Himitsu's choice to use "candy-striped" salmon meat leads to a more dramatic presentation despite a slight loss of richness.

I'm admittedly a bit of a sushi snob, but I don't need to gorge myself at spendy outlets like Tadokoro, Kaito, or Ota to be satisfied. However, due to the overall dependability of these restaurants, their sourcing of supremely high-quality seafood, and the mouth-watering plates of sashimi served, I am often willing to spend a little extra. Himitsu is such a place I'll open my wallet up for, and should be considered to be in the apex tier of sushi restaurants in San Diego.</Review>

Hands down best sushi I’ve ever had. This coming from someone who’s lived in NY all his life and has his fair share of great East Coast sushi. The toro melts on your tongue and is so tender you feel like you barely need to chew it. It’s hard to have sushi anywhere else after eating here.</Text>

Nice new Japanese restaurant in La jolla. Himitsu is focused on high end sushi and sashimi. Their omakase is great but not cheap. Well worth it and definitely will go back<//Text>

Do you love top quality extremely fresh and delicious sushi?  Then this place is for you. Tried 3 types of sushi I had never experienced. Black cod, Japanese perch, and golden eye snapper. Higher quality and higher standard here for sure.<//review>

Probably the best sushi I've had in years. Unlike most places they don't flaunt an obscene number of novelty rolls. Instead they focus on am excellent selection of lesser known fish. That's not to say that the favorites aren't there. Both their sake belly and hamachi belly were respectable and their o toro was easily the best I've ever had. And the uni (both the local San Diego and the Japanese) were phenomenal. But I was pleasantly surprised by the Japanese sardine, the black cod, and the golden eye snapper. All were very good. And the saba, though not pickled like the rest I've had, was simply amazing.

Though we don't normally get desserts we opted to try the yuzu panna cotta and were blown away. Most japanese restaurants stick with simple fare like green tea ice cream, but not Himitsu. It was light and refreshing and a perfect end to a perfect meal. I am completely fulfilled.

The best of the best! Excellent quality at Himitsu in La Jolla, CA.
Expert, friendly and awesome people work here. Every bite is a piece of art. Always fresh! Make sure you have a reservation. The place is small and pretty busy.<//text>

Great quality sushi, better than many of what I experienced in Japan even. Staff were friendly and knowledgable. Very reasonable price too. I see some criticism for pricing here, but they obviously don't know the fair price for this quality of sushi. The price is not a secret or anything, it's up to you to check on it before ordering something you don't know much or appreciate  ┐('д')┌</Text>

<Text>Prepare yourself to pay around 200 bucks for two persons. Nothing against the food here, but with this price, I'd rather go to Donovan's steakhouse. I can at least look at the ocean while enjoying my meal instead of sitting in the parking place to eat my food.< /Text>< Pics>

Amazing experience in La Jolla today. Everything was exquisite- we decided on Omakase and it was perfect. Every course was better than the next and our sushi chef Derek was the best!!
Thank you for making our night out super special.</Text>

<user_id>109096743747017137044<//user_id><text>The food was very tasty, but the portions too small and the price too high!! We ordered food to take away and were negatively surprised by the huge amount of plastic boxes that we trashed just 10 minutes later. It could've been packed in a more minimalistic way. One of us ordered a dish coming in 8 pieces, only to realize they had made 7... Such mistakes give kind of a mitigated impression, especially for the price we paid. The waitress taking the order seemed irritated by our presence and after making a mistake in the order, gave us a 1cent (!!!) discount... No joke.
The rest of the staff seemed very friendly though.
Bottom line: nice food, too much trash, I'll go elsewhere next time I'm hungry.<//text><gmapID>0x80dc03e376700407:0xe6521b675eaa605< /gmapID>< Rating>

If you're looking for a great sushi place, this is the spot. Don't let the exterior fool you, it's a hidden gem and the best place in San Diego hands down (even better than Sushi Ota in my opinion). Mitsu the main chef and owner is a great story teller and pleasure to sit across from. I'm hesitant to leave a review because getting a reservation at the sushi bar is hard enough as it is. Authentic, not swanky, it's the real deal.</review>

If you're looking for a great sushi place, this is the spot. Don't let the exterior fool you, it's a hidden gem and the best place in San Diego hands down (even better than Sushi Ota in my opinion). Mitsu the main chef and owner is a great story teller and pleasure to sit across from. I'm hesitant to leave a review because getting a reservation at the sushi bar is hard enough as it is. Authentic, not swanky, it's the real deal.< /text>

Delicious, fresh sushi. We ordered yellowtail, blue fin tuna, albacore, toro, hamachi, Himitsu roll, kenmedai, and lots of cold Asahi. Prices were a little more than average, but you're getting quality fish. The service was outstanding. Would come back for sure.</Review>

High quality fish, great service, and creative menu. The Omakase is pricey but well worth it. Mitsu san is also a great host and very friendly. He recently hosted a special Mexican-Japanese fusion dinner with a former chef from Puyol in Mexico City and it was a great experience. I hope he hosts more of those. Don’t forget to try the non-sushi appetizers in the menu!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dc03e376700407:0xe6521b675eaa605</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

An absolutely wonderful experience. The chef, Mitsu, presented a mix of flavors that delighted our palate. The decor is intimate and relaxed. The service was attentive without being intrusive. A bit pricey but it is a premier sushi experience in La Jolla.<//Review>

First time here and it's hands down one of the best sushi spots in all of San Diego.

Beautiful, quaint atmosphere, friendly service, ridiculously fresh fish, what more could one want of life? We made reservations several days ahead so we could sit at the coveted sushi bar. WORTH IT!

Chef Mitsu, the owner and head sushi chef (ex Sushi Ota) was extremely enthusiastic and entertaining. He was cracking jokes all night and had us laughing the minute we sat down.

I highly recommend the seared scallops, miso black cod, wagyu and puro toro.

Come here, you won't be disappointed.<//Review>

A1 hair cuts. I've been getting cut by Andres and he does an amazing job. He takes his time, ensuring a quality cut. I can't get cut by anyone else now because it just does not match Andres look.<//Review>

<review>Professional work as always personally I've been going to Andres for years but any of the gentleman that work there are quite the gentleman. If you're looking for a up to date stylish haircut that they take pride in and are all Barber trained and certified when you found the right place. You have to not mind spending $30 for a haircut don't forget dropping a tip as well they do straight razor beard shaves for around 10 bucks but I've never gone for that.  Great place as long as I'm living in Santa Rosa I'll be going there for my hair..</review>< Name>

<Review>I'm a college student visiting the bay area, and decided to get my hair cut here after months of camping and backpacking. Randy probably gave me the best haircut of my life. Randy knows how to cut hair into modern, fashionable styles. His attention to detail is immaculate. Outstanding!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I’m very, very satisfied with my haircut. I had gotten a haircut at a different location and they completely messed up my hair, didn’t think it would be fixable unless if I shaved my entire hair off! My man Charles was up for a challenge and he made it happened! His knowledge and skills impressed me a lot! Best haircut I’ve ever had in my entire life, not exaggerating! Respectful and professional! If you need anything go to my guy Charles , you won’t be disappointed at all!<//text>< Resp>

<Date>1495129630512</Date><Text>Rather than going down to the mall and just getting a quick cut I decided I to look online for a more high end and near by place. I found it here. Right in the center of town. Relatively busy so best to book and appointment, but I didn't and I still got in within a reasonable time frame. Rick, the guy who cut my hair, did a great job and cut my hair perfectly. He styled it, made sure there was no hair on me with a massage/vibration device that felt quite nice. This is my new spot to go to. I'll always go back</Text>< Name>

I've shaved my head for 12 years. Thought I'd grow it out and get a fade. My friend Erik recommended Armando C. at the Gentlemen's Parlor. I've been twice now and plan to go back regularly. His work is amazing. The atmosphere and music is to my liking. I'm not a fan of change so this was a big one for me. Armando makes it simple and enjoyable every time. Thanks Armando! See you in 4 weeks.

<Review>This is a great shop to go to for men's haircuts. It's clean and there up on all the latest men's trends. Pro Tip: make a reservation because this place gets busy (which is a good sign). I'm usually in and out within 30 minutes.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Caleb always hooks it up, super friendly and great atmosphere. Best waiting area I’ve ever seen at a barbers. Leather couches, pool table, projector and good music.</text>

Charles was very friendly and helpful in getting the haircut I wanted. He clearly gave my hair his undivided attention the whole time, while maintaining good conversation. The quality of service and work exceeded my expectations, especially at the price paid. I would absolutely reccomend Charles to anyone else and intend to return to him for my future haircuts.<//text>

I've been going to the Gentlemen's Parlor for about 4 months now, and Charles is my go-to (though all the guys are great). Hands down, Charles is the best barber I've ever had, and the place is busy yet clean and orderly. Whether it's a cut and/or shave, this should be your new stop!</Text>

<review>My son got his hair cut by Armando. We were there a good 20-25min. He incorperated different techniques to get a great result. My son loved the hair cut! Be prepared to pay though,  the cut was $30! Cash only.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>There is nobody that I trust more with my hair than Armando, the owner of the shop. Overall, the place is clean and the vibe is lively. I've never see a bad cut come out of the joint. I just wish that they had online booking...</Review>< pics>

I’ve been here before but this time it wasn’t so great, i’m assuming he was new barber. He himself knows how to fade my hair but he didn’t really get what I wanted I asked for a short trim on top and bald fade on the sides but he ended up cutting more off from the top than I asked. He didn’t let me look at my hair at all when he was cutting it so it felt like I was in the dark.<//text>

The worst barbershop in town. They will let you wait an hour before telling you that they're only seeing appointments for the rest of the day, and they take forever to actually cut your hair. Don't bother coming here if you're trying to accomplish anything else that day. And they definitely cost more than $7, more like $20.<//review>

Tucked away off Broadway in Chinatown. A small menu but plenty of tasty choices. I had an egg salad sandwich, it was delightful. I also ordered chizu curry fries, so good. I'll be back for their chicken sandwiches.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>One of the best sandwiches i’ve ever had. I got the honey walnut shrimp sandwich and it was amazing. Unfortunately, I devoured it before I could get a picture. You should also try the onigiri and fruit sando.</Review></record>

<rate>5</rate><review>Honestly the best Sando place I been to in a hot minute. This shop is discreetly hidden on a busy street in LA's Chinatown. I can't believe I've walked by it without noticing it before. The chicken was huge like it was bigger than the bread. The sauce, pickles, bulgogi onigiri and egg salad were to die for. Definitely coming back again.<//review>< gmapID>

Ordered honey walnut shrimp.  At first glance i thought it might be underwhelming - but after first bite i was taken aback.  Quality toast and shrimp in every bite.  A sandwich alone was filling which says a great deal, i regret not ordering the pickles of the day as they would likely have added to the sandwich.  Worth trying.< /Review><Rating>4<//Rating>< Gmap_id>

I thought the sandwiches were going to be small but they were hefty sandos!  I had the chicken and it was divine.   Splurge and get the curry fries!  So tasty.  Couldn’t finish everything but I have leftovers for later.  The staff was very kind too!< /Review>

Amazing Japanese sandwiches on perfectly baked milk bread and also convenient store-style treats! Had the pork sando and the honey walnut shrimp, both were super fresh and tasty! Don't sleep on the onagiri either, had the pork kimchi one and it was so good!<//Text>

<text>Honestly YES. This is the sando place we didn't ask for but always needed! Love the shrimp walnut sando IMO you don't need to add anything to it and I love that you get a crunchy walnut in most bites. (The chicken sando is solid too)

You can't eat here and not order the curry fries! Also be warned there is something addicting in their spicy sauce. I typically can't finish this sandwich in one meal as the portions are huge. Love coming to this local gem!< /text><UserId.>110100756511993435896<//UserId.><time>1619408540694</time><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Covid had me missing konbini fruit sandos super bad so when I found this place on Instagram, I ordered right away. Katsu curry exceeded my expectations as well. Pork and chicken were both juicy and crispy. If you are missing station curry and konbini staples, I recc. Katsu Sando to fill the void.<//Review>< Pics>

We loved it. The chicken Katsu was delicious. Great flavor and the chicken was moist and tender. Will definitely go back again!<//text>

Mmm katsu sando in the heart of chinatown! Tasty menu! Abides by social distance rules. Tasty sandos lots of options. Would come back again in a heartbeat. Wagyu sando was calling my name but ya see, the way my bank account works....</text>

(Translated by Google) Good portions and service although I didn't find the food very good.

There are no tables or somewhere nearby to eat, so orders are to go.

(Original)
Buenas porciones y servicio aunque la comida no me pareció muy buena.

No hay mesas o algún lugar cercano para comer, por lo que las órdenes son para llevar.</Review>

I really enjoyed my first ever laser hair removal treatment at Cienega Med Spa in Santa Monica. The entire staff was warm and welcoming, they answered ALL my question (I had a lot) prior to my appointment and at my appointment. I've been hesitant to try laser hair removal because so many places feel so gimmicky and honestly, a little shady. Cienega is upfront, the price you see on their site are the prices you get when you arrive. They aren't pushy with up selling, but make sure to inform you of all their packages and payment options. My nurse (I wish I remembered her name) was so sweet and talked me through the whole process and made me feel super comfortable. Go here! This place is great and I can't wait for my next appointment.</text>

<text>Super friendly staff. Everything was very effortless and professional. Made an appointment online. I was seen very quickly and didn’t have to wait around. The iv drips are life changing. Won’t go anywhere else.<//text><username>Stephanie Krein</username><Time>1619393413604</Time>< Response>

I honestly can’t believe how revitalized I feel after receiving the NAD IV. I have been just feeling blah lately and wanted to do a little self-care. I didn’t know which one to try and the girls said this one was popular. I was nervous but happy I went through with it. I’m excited to try the other ones!</text>

<Text>I went for my first laser hair removal treatment today, I was late and these ladies were extremely understanding and helpful, they put me in a room with food and beverages to wait for the next time slot. I’ve been to places that charge $50 if you call to cancel less than 24 hr before, but this spa and staff are amazing! Had an easy, relaxed and painless laser experience. Highly recommend.</Text>< username>

If I could give zero stars, I would. I made an appointment for laser hair removal and was asked no pre-appoinment questions when I made my appointment. When I arrived, a nurse practitioner asked me questions over video chat and when I said it had been two weeks since one area of a larger area to be lasted had been waxed, she didn't clear me for any of my session. What a GIGANTIC waste of my time.  That question should be asked at the time the appointment is made. Super unprofessional and bad policy. I would not recommend this place to anyone< /text>

<Review>I’ve been going to Raquel for a year now for facials & she brightens up my life (literally-haha) and with her wonderful attitude, sweet, caring and intuitive talent for working with the skin & face. She is super kind and warm-hearted and I always leave feeling refreshed and beautified. Her touch and massage is super thorough, relaxing, and feels amazing. She has never rushed me, she always takes her time and you can tell she really invests her whole energy into the work, wanting you to feel better than you felt before. I love you Raquel!! Thank you so much for taking care of me and my skin. You’re a bomb queenie pop. Also the hydrofacial at this spa is a must. You rock!! Thank you.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><GmapID>0x80c2a4cd04c52a15:0x934b66bdf637d3de</GmapID>< user_name>

Great place to get vitamin drips. Clean, classy environment and super nice staff.  I get the Myers Cocktail if I think a cold is coming on.  They also do B12 injections - which I like to get when I don't have time for a full drip.  There's also a nice coffee shop just down the block to chill at after your infusion.</Text>

Started out in the Beverly Hills location and loved it, then I found out they opened one in Santa Monica (closer to me) and it was much more convenient. Clean place with wonderful staff. Both locations are great! I purchased 6 small area sessions which I used for underarm and it was worth every penny. Great prices too!< /review>

<text>I visited the Santa Monica location for a full bikini and was really impressed with the service and results after the first session. They were able to fit me in that day, and it was quick and painless! Pricing is competitive and you can pay per session, rather than having to sign up for multiple sessions. Looking forward to seeing the results after my second treatment. Definitely recommend!!</text>< date>

I had a excellent experience with Cienega Med Spa. I called for a lat minute appointment and they accommodated me with no issue. The ambiance in the reception are was phenomenal and very welcoming for the first timer. The receptionist was both professional and friendly, and was able to process my information in a relatively short period of time. I received the Be Happy injection, and I must say I felt happy and stress free for several days; exactly as described. I will definitely go back for more treatments.<//Review>

I had laser hair removal done. It's almost always a great experience, you just have to let the provider know exactly what to do or if they missed a spot. Some do a great job, some rush through the session that you're paying a lot of money for.<//Text>

I went in after doing some research and read the reviews. I love this place. I recently had surgery and was unable to hydrate sufficiently. I made my apt on-line and was more than pleasantly surprised when I arrived. I ordered a large IV "Make your own" and loaded it with all kinds of vitamins. I was so happy that I ordered more and purchased a 10 pack. So comfy and relaxed and clean and professional. If I could give more stars I would.<//review>

<review>They are fantastic!!! I've been getting bikini laser for months (at the La Cienega location actually) and after the first time I noticed a major difference.  Their machine is painless, and they are quick and efficient.  The facilities are very nice, they provide parking, and their staff is friendly, smart, and will make you feel very comfortable.  I'm so happy I invested in this treatment (which is very affordable) and found this place.  The results have been everything I wanted.  Just make sure you heed their advice and do the treatments consistently and as frequently as they recommend for the best results.  They know what they are talking about.  I will definitely be investing in more treatments in the future.<//review>< pics>

HI there,

I went to the one on La Cienega Blvd. and had an IV vitamin drip and a booster shot of D3.  Felt like a great supportive experience that I trusted was a benefit to my overall health.  Everyone there is kind, helpful and patient.  It was like giving myself a present. Will definitely go again!< /text>

<text>I didn’t have the best experiences here. We spent hours there while my roommate was sick as they couldn’t hit any of her veins for the IV drip. I was also getting an IV so I sat there for hours with her. She never did get it, so the manager offered a b12 shot then had an attitude if I asked if I could come receive the IV I had paid for on another day since my roommate wasn’t able to receive it. She never came with the shot she had offered, so I went out and asked for it. Again she begrudgingly agreed.
When I went back to get the other Vitamin IV I’d paid for, they couldn’t get the needle in. I literally have huge veins and I still got stuck like 5 times. Then I’m certain there was no vitamin C in my IV—it has a distinct taste and feeling while receiving the IV—I also smelled the IV line and bag afterward and they didn’t smell of the Vitamin C which again has a distinct smell. The stuff assured me they had put the mix in correctly, but I think they were out and rather than tell me they sold me short.
I tip 20% and am polite no matter what happens in a customer service situation, so it’s not like I’m a difficult client. It’s too bad it didn’t go well: the space is nice and comfortable, the nurses are nice, and I live down the street. Sadly, I won’t be returning. I was looking forward to making this a regular neighborhood spot.

Update to Owner's Reply:
This is exactly why I won't be returning. The horrible attitude and lack of any genuine effort to rectify the situation. I was also getting a Vitamin IV with my roommate and sat there with her for hours while they tried to hit her veins over ten times. Again, I paid for the treatment and it was a gift I was sharing with her, so it affects me and is relevant to my experience. I also had trouble with them being able to get the needle in the next time where they had to try around 5 times and I never have any trouble getting IVs.
I'm sorry your employees didn't take notes or contact you about the issues that arose. Perhaps they didn't want to get into trouble?
I've had many IVs and I'm also sorry you don't agree about my experience, but since I was there and you were not present, this is the experience that was had. After two difficult experiences, I shouldn't have had to call. The management saw what was happening and could have rectified the situation right there. Again, the nurses were very sweet.
Arguing with a customer about her bad experiences at your business isn't going to help fix the situation or the review. And yes, after two months on a day I go to get a Vitamin IV elsewhere, this experience was so bad that it is still bothering me.</text><GmapID>0x80c2a4cd04c52a15:0x934b66bdf637d3de<//GmapID>< rate>

<text>What a amazing atmosphere! I had a nice experience at the Santa Monica location. I came in for the Sunrise Rise shot which helps the metabolism.  I was greeting promptly by a nice lady at the front desk.  Ruhie came out to greet me as well and then took me back to the room to administered the injection.  It was painless. Overall experience was awesome.  I will definitely return to try the IV treatment.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2a4cd04c52a15:0x934b66bdf637d3de<//GmapID></record>

Great experience from start to finish! I received a same day appointment at the time that I needed it. Arrived an hour early (drove from out of the area and left early to account for traffic, but didn't hit any) and appointment time was moved up so I didn't have to wait.
The staff was friendly and helpful. The facility was clean and professional. The IV Vitamin Therapy treatment was quick and easy. I'm definitely going back and would highly recommend them to my family and friends!<//review>

I went to Cienega Med Spa for a vitamin injection. The process was quick and easy and the nurse was friendly and knowledgeable. I was feeling under the weather and got the Be Happy injection and had much more energy after the shot. I found a meter out front but they were nice enough to let me know there's parking under the building for the next time I visit.</review>

I received a loaded vitamin B injection from the Santa Monica location and it was such a great experience! Cienega MedSpa is so clean and their staff is SO professional, helpful and friendly! The location is super easy to find and it is so clean there. My appointment itself took under a minute. I can not wait to go back! Such a swift process, really a great experience. I am raving about the shot itself, I have so much energy and really feel amazing. Being a vegetarian I feel like this shot is essential! Again, can not wait to go back!</text>

My lower leg laser hair removal experience here was great. The nurse was very pleasant and had an excellent bedside manner; the premises were very clean and organized; the lobby was very nice. The treatment itself was nearly painless, MUCH less so than traditional laser hair removal (which I've had on my bikini and underarm regions).

The only annoying aspect was that I had to stand outside of the building - on the street - for at least 10 minutes and wait for them to open the clinic for me, since I had the first appointment of the day, which they did right at the start of my appointment. The lobby should definitely have been open prior to the first appointment to accommodate patients who like to arrive a bit early.< /review>

I found this place online and saw all the product offerings and was highly impressed and decided to give it a try. I came for the first time to try an IV treatment to help with fatigue, weightless, and energy. After my first liter sized bag of the liquid fit I have never felt better. I am losing weight, energy levels are through the roof, and I am not nearly as tired as I once was. The staff are amazing and ever team member are top notch.< /text>

I have been to a lot of places for laser hair removal, but Cienega Med Spa wins! I had my lower legs done and purchased a package of 6 because the prices are definitely worth it. I highly recommend coming here for laser hair removal! The NP was friendly and informative - a combo I have not experienced at other spas.<//review>

Great place for cosmetic services
Great services! Have had laser hair removal, hydra-facial, and most recently had clear and brilliant for face, neck and chest at the West Hollywood location. Parking is fantastic! The location is beautiful, and nurse Mary was amazing! Very attentive and knowledgeable about all of the services they offer. Constantly asking if I was ok with the laser. The procedure felt like a mild sunburn, but looking forward to seeing the results! I would definitely recommended this place to my friends!< /text>

I went in for my second round of laser hair removal with Adriana.  I have loved the results after only 2 sessions, and it has made a huge difference in my every day life.  I have very sensitive skin, and shaving my legs has always caused irritation.  Now, after only 2 visits, I have noticed so much less hair growth on my legs and my skin looks and feels altogether smoother and softer.  Thank you!<//text>

I went to Cienega Med Spa to receive an Immune Booster IV Drip. This was my second time getting it from here and I would recommend it to anyone looking to get a boost for their immune system. I used to get sick all the time, but now I rarely get ill. You'll notice a difference immediately. The new location is very comfortable and convenient. The space where you receive your drip has a street view, comfy recliner with a furry pillow and super soft blanket. Parking is free. I absolutely hate needles especially when getting and IV, but Nurse Candace made it pain free and easy.</Text>

<text>I visited the Santa Monica branch for the Athlete's retreat vitamin IV. Both receptionist and nurse were very friendly, the facility was nice, clean, and pleasant. Iv treatment took about an hour while I relaxed on a recliner and watched a movie. After the treatment I felt a clearer mind and a feeling you get when your muscles are all rested up. I trust the nutritional IV that I got is a great addition to muscle recovery< /text>< username>

<text>The first time I went to Cienega for laser hair removal it worked. It actually worked! I'd done laser hair treatment before and it was very, very painful and had very, very minor results. But at Cienega, I could barely feel it and I got rid of more hair than half dozen previous treatments combined. So I went back.

This time I got the Painless Laser Hair Removal on my face to shape my beard and prevent ingrown hair problems I'd dealt with most of my life. Though I could feel the laser more on the dense, dark hairs on my face, the pain was nothing like what I felt when I went to other places. And the nurse was always concerned about how it was feeling. She was very nice and very patient as I explained my goals and my pointed out my problem spots.

I'd say that I'll keep coming back to Cienega Med Spa, but with the results I'm getting, I may not need to much more.< /text>< pictures>

<text>I had the anti-aging Vitamin IV (1 liter). Excellent service, right on time, in a very nice and comfortable facility. The procedure takes about 30 minutes, and you are left alone in a nice, quiet room to relax, read, or work as you see fit. This IV also includes an intramuscular shot of vitamins and CoQ10 at no extra charge. Melissa, the nurse, was superb and extremely nice. I definitely plan to return in the future. It's also nice they are open on weekends. A lot less traffic overall, and not as crowded as would be the case during the week.<//text>< Resp>

I didn't notice any difference right after, but next day I felt recovered and with more energy.<//Review></record>

I got the IV drip for dehydration. It was well priced, fast, and handled well. If you suffer from chronic dehydration this is your spot. In addition to the great prices, they are kind and thoughtful which is very much appreciated. Cienega Med Spa knocked it out of the park in my book.<//Review>

I had laser hair removal and skin perfection (to get rid of bumps around my eyes) today with Nurse Karla.  She is a sweetheart, and did a great job.  The office is very modern, with a nice spa atmosphere, and cute surfboard décor, which is appropriate for being a mile from the beach.< /Text>

I went in for the laser hair removal for small area.
It went really fast and painless. It was different from the machines that I was used to.
I was expecting some pain but it went really smoothly. The staff were nice and efficient and I didn't have to wait. I highly recommend the place.<//Review>

<text>I was headed on a ski trip and was looking to boost my energy and immune system. I called to make an appointment and they fit me in same day. When I showed up, I checked in with the receptionist who was very nice. I had already filled out the paper work online so they saw me right away. She brought me back to a very clean and comfortable room, recommended a couple options based on what I was looking for. The service I received was Brighten Up Vitamin C & Glutathione Injection and Be Happy Injection. The injections were quick and easy, I barely felt them and more importantly, I felt awesome for my ski trip and avoided getting sick. I felt very comfortable and will definitely be back. Thanks for a great experience, I would definitely recommend Cienega Med Spa.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

This was my first visit to Cienega Med Spa- Santa Monica. I had the Hangover Heaven Vitamin 1 Liter drip. The nurses were very attentive & very nice. The reason why I'm giving them 4 stars was because I was stabbed like 10 times trying to find a vein. I also hate needles so that wasn't the best.< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>If I have to describe one thing about Cienega Med Spa is: I can freely express that they are one of the greatest Med spa I pay visit every week for my vitamins treatment.
The reasons, I strongly believe they are superb, is the level of professionalism is exceptional and just remarkable.  From the moment the receptionist welcomes you and let your nurse know that you have arrived for your treatment. Tim the esthetician is marvelous guys, with extreme knowledge on how to keep a glowing face the entire months like Jennifer Lopez bronze glow… ouch love it but importantly how to care for your skin. Tim ‘s skin is thus lovely. Lastly is my lovely nurses who are just phenomenal with IVS and plus has great energy. They serve you water and snacks while you are receiving your treatment and once you are done, no need to scream to have your nurse back to the IV station, all you have to do is push a little remote bell control then your nurse appears. The facility is absolutely well ordered and I love taking their gorgeous glitters pen home with me.

Sincerely,

I got an all over body laser treatment. Full legs, bikini, face... etc etc. It took just under 1hour! I previously had laser done 7 years ago, and it used to take an enormous amount of time and it was quite painful. In certain parts, we had to numb with ice before doing the lasering. At Cienega, it was painless indeed. Even for the hardest hairs of all: bikini! NO PAIN!
Totally worth the money.</review>

<Review>I have been coming to Cienega Med Spa for quite some time and have been fascinated with the results. I have been doing a full back/shoulders laser hair removal as well as full buttocks. They definitely delivered on their promise of a hairless surface with negligible pain. (Pain is always a relative experience, so in my particular assessment I would venture to describe the sensation as heat rather than pain, which has always been tolerable and ephemeral.) After 8 sessions, I am hairless in my back and my buttocks area has seen a remarkable improvement overall; with perhaps two more sessions required to get to the desired hairless state.

What's most impressive is that their entire staff has been excellent. I have rarely seen the same nurse twice, which is perfect because they have all been stellar, attentive, clean and respectful when going "in between." This goes for both the BH and SM locations.

I have recommended this place to several friends and they also share in the compliments and good reviews.

I have also had two facials there and have also been elated with the finished product.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Everyone I interacted with at the spa came across as genuinely caring and determined to offer the best service possible.  I was surprised to see impressive results immediately after the procedure was completed.  The pain, or rather the discomfort, during the first ten minutes of the procedure was minimal.  I was warned that there could be swelling but I do not see any.  The spa is a beautiful facility and the treatment room felt like a 5 star hotel.  Couldn't be happier.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Cienega is a great Med Spa, I saw other reviews on Yelp and decided to check it out. When I arrived I was greeted warmly. I inquired about services for that day and they were immediately accommodating. The Botox injections were probably the best I have received, not painful, and she was very quick!
I will definitely be back for Botox and maybe the cool sculpting!! Thanks</review>

The front desk staff was very helpful and kind as well. I have since recommended four people to this med spa and they have all had great experiences as well. I was so happy with my CoolSculpt results that I want more! ;-) Thank you, Melissa and the staff at Cienega Med Spa!< /Text><Date>1461208510321<//Date><Rate>5< /Rate>< GmapID>

Had an appointment at 4:30pm and once we got there my gf just filled out and answered a few quick questions and she was called in almost instantly. Samantha was our practitioner and explained every possible procedure and was very detailed about it. Samantha showed us all the before-and-after pictures from previous clients and we couldn't believe the results. Samantha answered our every question and left feeling confident in the medical staff here!

Went in for my free consultation for coolsculting and it was truly impressive. The clinic is so clean and beautiful... the rooms are so nice and look so comfortable.  The entire staff was absolutely pleasant, and the nurse that did my consult answered ALL my questions.  She was Friendly and thorough, very knowledgeable about all the services offered. I had previously gone to another place for a coolsculpting consultation but felt super rushed and uninformed.  Cienega med spa was so much better in every way.  I can't wait to set up my next appointments.</review>

I would definitely recommend Cienga Spa and Nurse Jenifer for getting filler treatment. Jenifer is very informative and such a great professional, she patiently answered all my questions and told me what to expect! I was in LA just for a few weeks and was a little bit scared that I may not like the results or that when I will leave LA I will have issues with my face after. But Jenifer did a great job! I cannot complain ! next time when I am in LA, I will schedule an appointment to get some more fillers. Thank you again!<//text>

After doing a ton of research, I came to Cienega Med Spa for a Clear & Brilliant facial, and I felt so pampered! The staff is absolutely wonderful. Since it's a laser facial, they cover you in numbing cream first. I was nervous on if I would feel any pain, but there was absolutely zero, and a couple months later I swear I still see the results  of clearer skin and my brown spots are gone. (I was really hesitant going in and unsure on if it would work for me at all.) Right after the procedure, it will leave your face a little red, but I went across the street and ate at Real Food Daily right after since it didn't hurt. Parking is under the complex, you turn right once you see the building for it.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>We were looking for a place to do IV therapy for my mom because we feel she doesn't get enough fluids throughout the week and we're glad we chose Cienega Med Spa! We've been coming here for over a month, 1x/week for vitamin IV therapy. We do the create your own, which is great because you can customize what's going into your body instead of the prepackaged solutions they have. I'm giving this place 5 stars because they are able to start an IV on my mom on the first time, everytime! When she was at Kaiser the nurses there needed to call anesthesia to insert my mom's IV because my mom was such a hard stick. Yes, that is a testament to how skilled the nurses at Cienega are. In addition, everyone at the spa is so warm and welcoming. Helen at the front of the spa is always so nice and friendly. Ruhie, the RN, is always upbeat and energetic. This place is simply just a great environment to be in. My mom feels good after she's done with the treatment, so that's the most important part. We'll definitely be coming back!</text>< Pictures>

My appointment was fast, friendly and without pain! I Got a multiple B Vitamin
shot and didn't feel it! Front desk service was a breeze and very friendly. So
affordable, I splurged on a bottle of Lattise! Lots of parking, so I'll be back for
all of the above reasons.</review>

<review>I came in for a Hydrofacial and Tim was great! Got rid of some pesky clogged pores. Made my skin feel smooth and clean. I'd highly recommend him and this facial if you want to deep clean your skin. If you don't know what a Hydrofacial is, your missing out! It's a life saver especially for those who can't get rid of their acne.< /review><Date>1483679910556< /Date>< username>

<Date>1460574601447</Date><Review>I went in for my second coolsculpting appointment at the beginning of April - my first was for love handles and my second for my belly.   From the initial consultation to both treatments, the front desk staff and the nurses were all very helpful in explaining the procedure, the billing , how the procedure worked and what to expect.  The office is very clean and parking was easy.  I had a bit of discomfort for the procedure on my belly but they said this was totally normal and just to massage for the first few weeks.  They made me super comfortable during the procedure and have a nice private room with TV to watch as the machine works its magic.    Right after I left my appointment, I recieved a follow up email with care instructions and a call making sure that everything went smoothly.

Everything just worked really well and I think it's a testament of "you get what you pay for".   I'll try and post an update in a few months on the results of the procedure but just based on the customer service and experience, I definitely give them 5 stars.< /Review>< UserId.>

As usual, a no-drama experience at this low-key but oh-so professional spa. I am NOT a spa person, but have finally decided to tackle the black hairy legs and underarms.  I bought a package of six treatments for lower legs and underarms and this was my fourth visit.  Truthfully, if I shave once a week, it's a big deal. This has changed my life, because I NEVER showed my legs - they were way too white (with contrasting black stubble - oh so attractive).  Now I can fake tan like crazy without scraping it all off 12 hours later by shaving.  Nice, kind, not snotty in the least - can't say enough about these folks. I am hoping for the lottery so I can move closer and take advantage of more services!</review>

<Review>I actually went to the La Cienega location yesterday for my Bunny Bundle Laser Hair Removal treatment which covers one large area and two medium areas.  It's always generally a good experience because someone greets you and lets you know that you'll be helped soon.  While you wait you can shop around their front room that has fun knick-knacks like candles, books, and lotions.  They also have free water available in the front.  My nurse was really nice and really considerate of the heat of the laser.  It rarely got too hot to handle but if I made the slightest indication that I was uncomfortable then she gladly waited, turned the heat down, or applied more gel for my comfort.  I'm minusing one star because there's no readily available parking structure at the La Cienega location but they'll be moving soon and I was told their new place would have parking so that's exciting!<//Review>< Pics>

I go to Mike Seven whenever I need a massage.  I have a very painful neck and shoulder condition from working at a desk for so many years.  When it flares up, I get an hour hot stone massage with Seven and the pain melts away.  He has magic in his fingers.  I cannot recommend him enough.</text>

Here they told me what it will cost and how long it will take gave me the consultation right there and when i gave it the thumbs up they set me up in a matter of minutes😉. so im happy i didnt have to come back for a second time mainly b/c it was already a 2 hour drive 😝<//review>< pics>

Yay for pain-free laser hair removal!

I've been debating laser hair removal for a long time now, but for financial reasons and a big fear of pain, I've always been hesitant about going for it. Finally, after finding this place via Yelp, I decided to go for it and schedule my first appointment. At the time of this appointment, I've been to Cienega Med Spa twice -- both times have been excellent!

I've done two treatments of laser hair removal for my bikini area and one treatment for my upper lip. As promised, both times have been pain free which was perfect for my low pain tolerance. There was very little discomfort, and before you know it, the procedure was over. Both times, I've had awesome experiences with the staff. Both nurses were excellent in making me feel at ease and not all awkward, despite having to be in weird positions hahhaa. :)

As for results, I've definitely noticed reduction in hair, even after only one session. I booked a package of 6 for my bikini area, and I'm planning on booking another package for my upper lip and underarms. Ehhh, what can you say, I'm just a hairy person. :P But ANYWAY, booking in a package is also perfect for me, because it helps keep the cost per session down :)

I highly recommend Cienega Med Spa. The location is super clean, and the customer service is stellar. And if you're scared of pain, no fear because the claims are true! I love how easy it is to book appointments online. Both times, I've been able to get in the next day, which is awesome.

Bottom line- laser hair removal is honestly one of the best investments I've ever made. I'm glad I chose this place to do it. :)< /review>

RUN AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Every review you read about Cienega MedSpa is fake!  All clients are bribed to leave good reviews by being compensated with gift cards and discounts which by law, is fraud.

I paid $10,000 for 20 Coolsculpting treatments.  I used 9 of them on my first visit.  For whatever reason, they did not work.  I have seen ZERO RESULTS after almost 4 months.

I am not new to cosmetic surgery having had liposuction twice as well as several facial plastic surgeries.  I am now scheduled to have lipo again as I only need touch up.  I am 5'3", 130lbs and size 4.

The worst part however is that they have given me the run around about refunding me for my UNUSED treatments and refuse to refund me for the sessions used.  I get it.  I used the sessions.  But I didn't pay for sessions.  I paid for results.  And I got NONE.  They still have not refunded me for my unused sessions.

Good luck getting anyone to return your calls or emails.  The CEO, Rose Nadalie-Werz hides behind the staff and doesn't return calls. After calling Dr. Edward Stokes, the Medical Director, directly, today, I finally got an from the CEO but Werz still won't get on the phone to discuss and instead is now hiding behind email.  I find this highly unprofessional.

I now have to file a small claims suit.  It's $10,000... I can't just walk away. But you should definitely RUN AWAY!!</Text>

I saw the company on Groupon with services offered at a discount. I  booked an initial consultation and was quoted prices at the full service rate.  When I explained that I was a different price quoted on the Groupon site, staff denied that they advertise on groupon.  I had to show them the ad. However, the Groupon expired so the whole experience wad a waste of time.<//text>

<time>1454308806459< /time><review>I went in for my second and last abdomen coolsculpting this past Saturday because of my amazing results a month ago.  I literally dropped 8% body fat after one treatment and the pointy budge is no longer there.  During my second treatment (Freeze the Fat Abdomen Large Applicator 2 Areas), I went ahead and did my love handles (Freeze The Fat Love Handles) to balance out my body.  The procedure to the love handles did not hurt compared to the abdomen area.  I really enjoyed my experience with Cienega Med Spa!  They are very friendly and provide Netflix for you to watch during your one-two hour procedure.  If you are considering a toner body for the upcoming summer, hitting the gym may not give the immediate results.  If you combined CoolSculpting and working out, you will see faster results.  After my first coolsculpting, I was going to the gym 7 day's per week (2 hours each time).</review></record>

<Text>Acupuncture working wonders for recovery after knee surgery!!!

I never tried acupuncture before but I had a complex tear in my medial meniscus which resulted in arthroscopic surgery. Western physical therapy is working but the results were seemingly slower than I expected.

I did some research online and found the lovely Dr. Gorman. Our first meeting was very comfortable and she has a great attitude about life and healing (she's very pleasant to be around) you'll see. : )

She really listened to what my expectations were regarding my recovery and she's doing a stellar job of helping me achieve them.

I especially liked the fact that she is trained in orthopedic and internal medicine since my partial meniscectomy was an orthopedic procedure. I've had 4 treatments in the last month with her and I've experienced marked improvement in the reduction of pain, swelling, stiffness and fluid in the knee as well as an increased range of motion.

Although many insurance companies do cover acupuncture, mine does not. Check to see if yours does. I figured I'd pay for one session and see how it went. I noticed such an improvement in the days after my therapy with Dr. Gorman that I decided to continue treatment out of my own pocket. It has been worth EVERY penny and I'm soooooo glad I found her.

I will say that usually when I leave her office I don't necessarily notice the improvement that day. It usually takes about two or three days after the appointment that I really start to see things improving. Sort of like when I go to the gym, I'm not sore right after training, but I feel it in the next two days following my workout. I'm sure everyone heals and responds differently, but that has been my experience.

Dr. Gorman is a consummate professional and a wonderful person. You are in good hands with her!!

Highly, highly recommended!!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

Clerks are always wasting time with small talk to customers. Most times there's only ONE clerk at the window.

Clerks go away from window for long period of time.

I've experienced long waiting times with waiting line almost our the door.

Facility is messy and needs to be cleaned in and our.

Front and side entrance are dirty and need to be cleaned up.

Clerks often charge highest rate even when you want to ship at the most economical rate. Why do they do that?

Every one in that office takes their job for granted. You can tell poor management and lack of communication within employees.

All these issues costs money for customers.</review>

This post office never delivers mail to the right address. I never have this issue with Amazon or ups or any other shipping company. If you have a second address. I recommend trying out another usps because this place fails to get it right from delivery to customer service! They never answer their phone and when you go in person, they are very rude.< /Text>

I came over to this place to have my passport renewed but there was no defined line so a bunch of us were getting confused on who to go next. I lined up 6feet apart from the customer in front of me but a rude employee told me to line up outside. As I agreed, i moved to line up outside but the next customer behind me started to line up at the door. However, she let that customer go up next meaning I just lost my place in line. As I got to the window, I was working with another employee but the rude employee was at the window next to ours. She proceeded to make comments to another customer about how customers can be “dumb and not know how to line up” in front of me. Horrible service. Rude, unorganized, and lazy workers</review>

Worst Post Office ever. It is huge with like 9 teller windows but typically only 1 or 2 are posted with a person. I went in today and there were 12 people in line, 2 windows open. Then one of them closed up and now there is only one. The remaining teller was allowing people to fill out forms at his window instead of the norm. of having them step aside to do that while servicing another customer. He also was cracking jokes and chatting while all of the people were waiting. It took more than 40 minutes to get to the front of the line. He had NO CONCERN WHATSOEVER for all the people that were in line and waiting. The lady in front of me said she was never coming to this location again. I won't either. Everyone was looking at each other in disbelief. So rude and unnecessary.<//Review>

Monday, March 1 sent a next day delivery envelope to my daughter zip code 90028.  Delivery was attempted today, 2 days late.  I received a text stating delivey was attempted but no access to her apartment mailbox.  BS as she regularly gets first class mail AND packages w/I a problem.  So paid $26.35 for next day and it can't even be delivered properly 2 days late.
Fed Ex next time.< /review>

The line was fast probably because I came here at the end of the day. The post office worker was rude to me, I tried to send a letter, and she was not looking forward to helping me out. However there is self-service machine which works perfectly fine. I will only stop here another time if it's an urgent need. Otherwise, I will choose another post office</review>

<Review>This review is for Geraldo. He helped process my infants passport this past weekend.

going to the post office always feels like a daunting task so when I had to apply for my infants passport I wasn't excited about having to take the trip.

Geraldo was extremely fast and thorough gave us all the information we needed and addressed every question we had.

I can say I wasn't impressed by the cleanliness outside the building that definitely needed someone in a hazmat suit to clean but that isn't the employees fault.

Of course dealing with the post office is the luck of the draw. But for my luck it was Geraldo and he made our experience a good one.< /Review><resp>None</resp><rate>5< /rate><user_id>108721491822344593650</user_id>< Name>

I recently became a US citizen and went to the USPS on Wilcox this morning (9/25/19) to submit my passport application. I was dreading going there based on the reviews on here, but I was pleasantly surprised. Gerardo called me exactly at the appointment time and was extremely polite as he went through the whole passport application process. He patiently went over my documents and was always smiling while speaking - I was very impressed with his demeanor and his willingness to help. All in all, I had a great experience - two thumbs up!< /review>

Too bad I have to give them any stars. They are rude inconsiderate and they are all thieves. I don't know why or how they could have been hired. What they do is a complete bait and switch technique where they offer something online and then refuse to accept your IID. They keep your money and refuse to give it back to you. I asked to speak to a supervisor and they refuse to allow it to happen.< /review>

It’s ridiculous, your fees in general. $6 for an .03 ounce overweight package? So disappointing will less likely use your services to ship. Will most likely use either UPS or FedEx< /text>

Ok so I had a few bad experiences at this place. But I could not hold back again. I had to write this review. I scheduled an appointment to do my passport on Thursday for a Saturday. Came there 10 minutes before like they td me to. Walked in and walked back to the passport section and waited and waited and waited passed my appointment time. Decided to walk up to a teller who refused to answer a question because i wasn't in line. Stood in line to ask where the passport assistance was. I was told that the person handling that is not here and they have no idea when he will be there as noone there is able to help me. Took my number and told me she'll call me when the "guy" is there.

Joyce is the only one that has ......a heart of compassion, an understanding & empathetic nature, & the patience of.......well, you get my point. The other staff members behind the windows need a reminder of what it’s like standing in an unemployment line applying for benefits. They’re obviously very comfortable in their positions, can’t go any further in the government, & talk about retirement but yet shy away from actually retiring.
Kudos to FEDDEX, AMAZON, & mail carriers in the private sector.<//Review>

JOYCE is the best! 5 stars for her! When I walked into this location I spoke to other tellers first and they basically gave me no hope about my situation. It was like " Well this is not a pick up location so the package is going to be sent back" I had no idea. I began to get worried my package would be sent back all the way across country when I needed the items inside it yesterday (Priority 2 day shipping was late). But then, they directed me to speak with Joyce. She took the time and really made an effort to check things out for me. She was nice and didn't make promises but told me she was going to try her best and she did! She still took care of other customers while taking care of me. She didn't look at the clock and say well we are going to close soon and theres nothing we can do like most establishments. She really provided good customer Service. Thank you Joyce! 5 stars for you! This review was overdue for a while I hope she still works there.<//text>

Joyce was very helpful! She was taking care of the questions from the line. She checked my passport renewal application and made sure I had everything correct and in the right envelope. The line went pretty fast as well. It was a Wednesday around 2pm.<//text>

<text>The fact that I'm reviewing a post office should say something... This is the absolute WORST post office to ever exist. There is no customer service whatsoever. All the workers make it well aware that they don't want to work there or want to help anyone. I also recently had a package slip in my p.o. box and when I brought it to the counter, the girl gave me attitude and told me that they lost whatever it was and said I put the slip in my box myself to waste their time... Just don't go here.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Underhanded behavior, unconscionable disrespect, incompetence on every level, zero accountability, and truly the worst attitudes humanity has to offer, make up a significant portion of the personnel at this unanimously and famously hated, 150 -one-to-two-star rated Hollywood post office on Wilcox (#1 worst rated post office in the whole United States), where the postmaster/general manager not only permits the employees to conduct themselves however they please, but justifies, makes excuses for, and blames you for the employees conduct when confronted with complaints and facts. I've honestly never witnessed this level of disrespect and conduct take place at any business of any kind.</Review>< pictures>

They are the worst post office I have ever dealt with. First off, they would take days upon days to even scan in my packages after they would pick them up from my apartment complex. One time the mail carrier came and didn't even grab my packages from the outgoing mail. My husband started bringing them to the drop off bin at the post office since we figured they would scan them in faster but HELL if we were wrong. They lost 3 out of 4 packages that were dropped off together. I filed a missing package search request and they haven't even responded. My husband spoke to the supervisor there and they just threw their hands up like "oh well, too bad for you" as if he isn't interested in helping. He then says that sometimes packages aren't scanned until they reach their destination? What? Why aren't they scanning them as receiving them there??! Anyways my customers never received their items and I had to refund them. This post office is a joke and so are their employees.</Text>

This is my post office and I love it.  From the art deco architecture to the naturally cool interior, this is old Hollywood.  The people working the counters have always been helpful and kind to me.  The line is usually okay.  The people in line are interesting Hollywood types, fun to watch.  The street is a little iffy and can have dubious characters on it.<//review>

I can not order packages or have anything delivered to my house via USPS because of this branch.  I have had 6-7 packages back to back say they are delivered, but are no where to be found and USPS cant find them.  If something is sent to me I have to use UPS/Fedex/etc. I can no longer order anything online that ships USPS which is terribly frustrating as some things are free to ship via usps.  This is the most disfunctional branch of a business I have ever experienced.  I am confident an employee steals packages as this can not just be coincidence..... someone needs to look into this.<//text>

The lady at the window did absolutely nothing to help. All she did was vomit up their policies and explain about how their trucks deliver, but refused to look up my.information when I had the ID tracking number. She was incredibly rude and wouldn't listen to me. It's been over a week since since my package was shipped and she refused to help. Her advice "Just wait." All she cared about was closing on time and leaving. Worst person ever to deal with at a workplace.<//Text>

This office is absolutely pathetic.  The staff is unbelievably rude and incompetent.   They have absolutely no communication internally and just pass the buck around.  They have lost the Certified mail that they supposedly left a note in the mail box. Personally, I don't think the mail man every attempted to knock on the door because I was home all day.   Wasted 1 hour at the office trying to retrieve a certified letter, and they absolutely had no clue where it was.  Then the supervisor says, "Sorry about that".  It is an absolute joke of an office< /Text>

< Review>
There is no question that this is the worst Post Office in the nation. Disgruntled employees (with the exception of one person who is always very sweet and very chatty) and horrific mail service. Someone should go in with a hidden camera just to witness what we're all talking about. It doesn't matter if you greet them with a smile or not, they all seem as though they are so unhappy. I'm starting to wonder if there is a torture chamber in the back! For real though, this place should be profiled on the news...it's THAT BAD!<//Review>

Another government agency-horrible
Rude. Inconsiderate. Of course government workers have a lack of costumer service because they don't terminate according to customer service and performance. Bare minimum = waste of government resources. I usually don't have such disdain for a place but this place lost a package and could care less, and during Christmas time!</Text>

My favorite post office. The staff know what they are doing and work hard in spite of the mean and rude customers that come through the door late and in a hurry complaining while in line. It’s definitely a hostile environment for the employees at times. So proud of them.<//Text>

<Text>Yes there are some nice people that work here BUT it is notoriously known as the worst post office in town.  Missing mail or misdelivered mail is a regular occurrence. And it's never the unimportant stuff: Medical authorizations, pay checks, legal documents, even the banks complain that client's never receive their Bank cards!!! All this mail is put in the wrong mailboxes, never delivered at all or missing.
This has nothing to do with theft, this is the incompetence of the post office.< /Text>< Response>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Look, I gave one star because I'm frustrated and my package is a week overdue and it's ruining my Christmas plans. Generally I don't care about late packages but this package in particular is important. And when I try to get help via the 800-number, they say I have to contact my local post office for information. So I do. And the people at this post office don't know anything. Nobody can help me. All they can do is put their hands up and shrug off an "IDK". Very short and curt. No real empathy or concern. What's even more frustrating is my package states "Held at Post Office" but it's not there.... they say it's out for delivery. And yet no update on my tracking number or anything. It's like having a tooth ache and going to the dentist only to hear "we have a lot of problems, we might fix that cavity soon.

At this point, I'll just consider my package lost so I can stop being stressed about it.

Overall, my 1-star is for the poor customer service.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

I have no idea who is the employer of this facility. The amount of patience I lost with you guys is ridiculous. This is the 4th time I am having an issue with receiving an international package. NO NOTE FROM WHO EVER DELIVERS THE MAIL THAT THE PACKAGE WAS "DELIVERED",  NO NOTE THAT THEY WERE HERE WHAT SO EVER, NO NOTIFICATIONS AT ALL!! I HAD 4 PACKAGES SENT BACK EACH TIME BECAUSE NO ONE NOTIFIED ME THAT THE PACKAGE IS "HERE". I HAVE NO ISSUE WITH GOING TO THE POST OFFICE AND PICK UP MY MAIL IF YOU ARE TOO LAZY TO BRING IT TO MY APARTMENT BUT HOW CAN I DO THAT IF YOU GUYS DON'T EVEN LET US KNOW IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!??? WHEN YOU TRY TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE NO ONE WANTS TO HELP YOU, THEY EITHER GIVE YOU A NUMBER THAT NO ONE ANSWERS TO, I'VE BEEN PUT ON HOLD FOR 50 MINUTES TWICE TODAY, NO ANSWER BACK!! OR THEY JUST SAY THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT! NOW THE PERSON WHO SENT ME THE PACKAGE NOT ONLY LOST SHIPPING MONEY BUT ALSO HAS TO DEAL WITH CUSTOMS WHICH ARE VERY EXPENSIVE AND DEALING WITH CLAIMS AND WASTING ENERGY AND TIME ON THAT, JUST BECAUSE YOUR EMPLOYEES DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DO THEIR JOB. START HIRING PEOPLE THAT ARE CAPABLE OF WORKING PROPERLY!</text>

Our mailman from this location leaves boxes in the rain, outside where they can get stolen. He wears headphones and when not talks loudly on his cell phone. When the landlord mationed the situation about the packages he rudely replied, fo fb ile a complaint! What a joke! Where do they hire these losers from???<//Review>

I was supposed to have some packages delivered on Sunday.  I ordered them through Amazon.  The ones delivered by Amazon rang the box at the gate and I buzzed them in for delivery.  The ones that were coming through USPS, Hollywood Station, never made it.  When I checked tracking, the website stated my receptacle was blocked, however, no one rang through the box at the gate and no note was left so as far as I can tell, they just drove up saw the gate and kept on driving.  Then, when I am trying to call them to see where the items are so that I can pick them up as I needed them this morning, I cannot get an answer on their phone line.  This is why the Postal Service is struggling, they do not have the customer service that the other delivery services have.</text>

It's a post office, so the normal complaints will always be there, but this one actually isn't too bad. They have 3 self-service machines, so use those if you can.

Free parking across the street is actually the worst part. It's so unregulated that there is never any open spots even when there is no one even in the post office. It took longer to find parking in the large lot than it did to actually mail my package.

So many people must park here and go somewhere else.<//Text>

This post office is the worst post office in country i believe , i shipped something overseas and when i was asked to fill out the customs for which i did explain what was inside and also answered correctly all their questions on the monitor fragile, liquid etc and  paid them $50 to ship it after 3 days later the package returned to me with the letter from the customs that can't be shipped overseas after receiving back the package i returned to this post office after i had called the 1-800 which i was told to go and get the refund since the package never left Los Angeles . I talked to their very rude manger Maria Ayala and she slammed the window door in my face telling me that they did their job and shipped the package but was not their responsibility that my packaged never left Los Angeles and it was my fault and they will not be issuing the refund , really ?  I was told by the national post office that i should be receiving the refund no questions asked since they did not provide the service i paid for .That's how they handle the issues by blaming on their customers and not taking responsibility for their own mistakes since they took the package knowing what is inside (if that batteries are prohibited than don't ship it out and don't charge me for something that can't be shipped out by customs. Instead they took the money and now blaming me for shipping the package which clearly they are the ones that should inform customers  prior shipping. No not this post office . I had to call consumers affair and talk to them and open the case since they refuse to give me the refund . I am still in the process to get the refund after had spent countless hours on the phone and dealing with my case since the lazy manager Maria Ayala with her assistant Pedro Partida closed my case 2 times and now i had to take it to the higher lever so these irresponsible employees act like these are the ones that makes final decision even they are wrong still wouldn't not admit it instead of taking the short cuts and blaming the customer and thanks god i have documented everything to prove these liars wrong and   hopefully make them more aware that you can't slam the windows in customers face and not to take accountability for their own lazy employees and their own mistakes. Shame on who run this post office like that.</Review>

Drunk mailmen dumping the contents of the mail in the driveway! Mis-delivered mail to everyone in my neighborhood, so we all deliver to each other.   Well, at least you get to meet the neighbors that way!  Overall, just an abomination, service-wise. It's in a beautiful building, however!
A vindictive mailman who, after I reported the huge amount of mis-delivered mail, went "postal" on me, and at Christmastime he returned all of my Christmas cards to the senders, and didn't deliver any mail to me for days before Christmas!  Nice. He marked a package as delivered to me, yet I never got it.  They hire dishonest mail carriers and will do NOTHING to follow up on it or investigate it.

Problem #1 -
2 day priority shipping. Package was lost and two weeks later sent back to the sender.

Problem #2
Sender decides to 1 day overnight the EXTREMELY IMPORTANT paperwork paying $20 to do so. It has been four days and I still have not received the package. (They're response, I guess we will have to refund the sender.)

Just to add to the problem THEY NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Review>

My mailman is a disaster, but this location itself provides respectful and helpful. It is located in central crazyville, Hollywood, so considering its location, the workers are pretty great.
The customers here can be very obnoxious and entitled and forget that the workers are not responsible for how many windows are open.< /Review>

They have a tough, underpaid job. The people at the counter are always nice and very helpful. The delivery people always bring our buildings packages to our doors.<//Review>

<Review>This is the worst post office I have been to in my entire life!!!  The staff is rude, they act like they are doing you a favor by giving you your packages, the staff talk amongst themselves and joke while a long line of people waiting to be helped, and now have told me they can hold your mail and not give it to you ever!!! This was told to me this morning by a Cedrick Carmichael,  who then refused to give me that name and number of his supervisor!!!< /Review>< gmapID>

<text>Absolute nightmare! My package I sent out in November was never received and I was never given a tracking number! The postal employees here are incredibly rude and some even condescending. I’ve spent a ridiculous amount of time waiting around for a manager to assist me. The staff is completely useless and incompetent.

This post office is a disgrace. I dropped a package off here with a prepaid label, and made the mistake of not having it scanned immediately and getting a receipt for the drop-off.  Close to 3 weeks went by with no record of the parcel being dropped off/en route, and I had to go through the trouble of filing a claim with USPS, as well as a still-pending dispute with my credit card company (it was an item I was returning to a retailer that was very pricey; understandably, the retailer could not refund me without any proof that I had ever shipped the item back). To make matters worse, I soon discovered several other complaints online about this branch, where people's parcels went missing and/or were stolen, and were never even scanned in, remaining untraceable.  A high stress situation to say the least, as this was an expensive item, like I mentioned. Save yourself some grief an go to a different branch!  And, if you must use this one, be sure to get a receipt for anything you send from here, to protect yourself.</Text>

<review>I have LOST so many priority shipments to me and if it's scanned - the PO says it was delivered - no questions!  DELIVERED TO WHO?  The postman that is scanning could be stealing my stuff cause I have a locked mailbox and if he put them in - I wouldn't be bitching about it on this site!  MORONS - I put in claim after claim and they just beat you down - so now I have no parcels or re-embursments! CRAP!</review>< UserId.>

She told me directly, this is MY post office -- whatever you read at the website, or whoever you talked to via the 800 number doesn't know Sh&*.  Issues we've had with this post office:  lost mail, lack of polite service, changing and inconsistent policies (my intern consistently used my debit card and pin to make business mailings but now they're saying they'll only allow him to purchase with company card).  Just thought I'd suggest you visit any other post office than this one. :D</Review>< Date>

THE WORST POST OFFICE IN AMERICA!!!!!!! They never scan in any packages! I drive to literally any other post office just to ship things because they are so bad at their job! The pick up service is a joke. They should scan in your package when they pick up but they dont. such a pain!!</Review>

This is a Great Post office with people who work hard and are very generous to help and I'm sure annoyed with some of the self centered characters that come in with wacky energy and needs and anger and oddities.

I can only reiterate: THE WORST POST OFFICE...ever! Same experience as everyone else. THIS TIME  I'm on hold with their awful phone options to try and get my money back for EXPRESS MAIL PRIORITY GUARANTEED NEXT DAY BY 3P...who was I kidding? Never arrived, no attempt, once it left the sorting facility...gone. No one knows anything! Perhaps Ups or Fedex aren't so bad after all. USE AN ALTERNATE. IT'S NOT WORTH THE AGGREVATION.  AND....they do not answer the phone, true! DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE HIGH STAR REVIEWS...THOSE REVIEWS ARE OLDER AND THEY GO INTO THE BUILDING TO GET THEIR MAIL. WHOever they are hiring now, are clueless, that's why the service is so bad. Obviously the US Post office doesn't care or they would hire a new freshman class!</review>

Every online source says "Sat 8:30am - 5pm" but apparently they're actually only open til 3PM!!! In the brief time I was there literally dozens of people walked up only to be turned away while staff (visible thru the window) just smirked and ignored them (us).. Always a pleasure dealing with the government! Considering how well the gov handles mail its hard to understand why anyone would want them to handle healthcare.</review>

<Review>I just spent over an hour waiting for my mail from the pick up line after giving my pink slip to the clerk. Daniel( an older hispanic man)was the clerk who took my pink slip. He vanished into the back and never returned. Another man appeared at the window,  named Arnold, said he did not have my pink slip.  Turns out they lost my pink slip while they were in the back . Arnold offered no help as to how to get my mail now that he or Daniel lost my pink slip.< /Review>< Pics>

They just blame the other post office a few blocks away. Truth is they both are unorganized even with a tracking number they can't find anything.<//Text>

This post office is sketchy , its in a crudy part of Hollywood so you never know what kind of characters will show up cause I've seen some craziness happen many times while delivering packages and letters from there . Also the line is always super long especially since they usually only have 3 people working the windows and they don't keep boxes and shipping envelopes stocked very well cause they often are out of basic sizes .</Text>

(Translated by Google) Post office in itself very nice. The staff are not too friendly but then still helpful.

(Original)
Postamt an sich ganz schön. Die Mitarbeiter sind nicht all zu freundlich aber dann doch noch hilfsbereit gewesen.<//text>

Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had any any retail store, Period!   The cashier let someone buy something literally out of my hand that was very valuable and rare.  The manager said it was theirs to sell to anyone that pays first no matter who is in possession of that item.  I felt like I was robbed.  I can’t believe this happened.  I would have never thought a store would treat their customers so poorly

Response to Owner’s response - you’re employees are NOT telling you the truth.  I never told anyone I did not want the stereo.  Myself or my wife were touching the stereo the ENTIRE time.  It was never returned to stock.  I did ask the cashier while my wife held the stereo, if you’re store would sell just the speakers, I wanted them either way though.  I was told no.  Another shopper then asked the cashier if I was buying the stereo.  The cashier  told them no without asking me and other customer paid for them while i was still in possession of them.  The cashier admitted she was wrong, ask her!.  The mistake was hers and instead of making it right she just let the other customer get them.  I understand a mistake was made, but that should have been between the store and the customer who never had possession instead of making me walk away.   Feel free to leave your name or number and I will speak to you in person.   You store though was 100% at fault.  I refuse to waiver on that point.  I believe you can also contact me through Yelp privately.  Same review there too< /Text>

<resp>{'time': 1618436699552, 'text': "I looked into your experience at our Milpas store as the way you described it was of concern to me. What I have learned is that you wanted to buy the speakers separately from a stereo set. That wasn't an option. Since you only wanted the speakers, you chose not to purchase the full stereo set at that time, returning it to our inventory while you looked at other items in the store. During that time, it was available for purchase by other customers, which is what happened. It would be great if we had multiple of the same items like traditional retailers. However, the one-of-a-kind treasures are what makes our stores unique and fun. A decision not to purchase something valuable and rare when given the chance may lead to someone else swooping in to get it. I wish you didn't have the regret of not buying the stereo set when you had your opportunity. However, even though the sense of being robbed is real for you, it was not the fault of the store staff."}</resp><GmapID>0x80e913827c6dc967:0xc80d4124a80b91f2</GmapID>< date>

<text>I had a bad experience at this store recently.  It started as a mistake made by the cashier.   It could have been easily fixed but uncomfortable since it involved another customer.   Rather than doing the right thing the cashier told me she wouldn’t fix her mistake, even though she admitted she made one..  I have been in management and hospitality most of my life.  I currently have my own small business.  This is NOT how you handle mistakes.  I asked to speak to a manager.  The manager had the same attitude.  He told me what is done is done and had no interest making things right.   If one of my employees avoided responsibility like this, they would have been fired.  This was completely unprofessional.  I was so upset by this whole ordeal and wrong doing I left the store and called the corporate number.  I spoke to a receptionist.  She refused to take my name and number.  She told me they don’t handle thrift store issues.   She offered to give me the phone number of the thrift store I just left.  That made no sense.  I then emailed the Executive Director of the company.  No response from him either.   I’m left with the feeling the management and employees can do whatever they please with no accountability.  They will gladly take you donations and money but treat you with zero respect.  Without customers they wouldn’t  have a job.  Stop treating your  thrift store customers  like they are less than the people your organization is trying to help. Everyone deserves respect and non professional behavior should not be tolerated. Thank you.

P.S - if anyone responds trying to say this did not happen, this is further proof that they avoid accountability</text><Time>1618759498752</Time><gmapID>0x80e913827c6dc967:0xc80d4124a80b91f2< /gmapID><rating>1<//rating>< user_id>

Alpha has the best stock and selection of the area thrift stores.  However, the items are all donated so they should be more reasonably priced.  There is new management, a breath of fresh air but there are still policies that actually prevent purchase.  You can do just as well to shop at Ross.  But you wouldn't come across the occasional score that do exist.< /text>

<Review>I have read through a few of your recent reviews.   And I completely disagree with the opinions.
My experience is that they are WAY over priced.  They have much of their merchandise priced at retail priceing.
How can these so called thrift stores claim non profit status?  The taxes etc.. are much different for retail entities than for non profits..
Who are the people at the top?  How much do they make from Alpha Thrift?
These might be good things to think about when you are supporting your local non profit.</Review>< Resp>
{'time': 1528297176639, 'text': 'Lori, it is evident by your comments that we still have work to do in helping the community understand that Alpha Thrift Stores are not their own entity, but a funding source owned and operated by Alpha Resource Center (alphasb.org). We empower individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The thrift stores, which we have operated for some 30+ years, provide a significant source of funding for our programs as public funding does not cover our program expenses. When you shop at Alpha Thrift Stores you are supporting Alpha Resource Center and the individuals we serve.'}<//Resp>

Great store but is too expensive for donated items. I find items at antique malls that are the same price and those vendors pay for the merch they sell. Also, Alpha often groups incongruent items to sell for a bundled price, I wish they wouldn't< /Review>

<review>We had a male waiter I don’t recall his name but he was great! His recommendations on what to get did not disappoint. For appetizers we had bacon Mac and cheese balls so delicious and wings. My boyfriend had the bison and bacon burger which was good but my eat your veggies burger was better yum!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Our 20 minute wait turned out to be about 5 so a big plus there. The menu is pretty diverse if you love a good burger; they have a bunch to choose from. There's a full bar that'll have just about anything you can think of.
My only complaint would be how long it took to get our dinner after we ordered. Seemed a bit too long for burgers. Still, a nice place with good decor and lively atmosphere.</text>

<Text>Its a  nice setting but the food is not that tasty. The appetizer came out not even hot, pretty much room temperature. I guess their thing is burgers but there not even fresh patties. Its just ok I mean I would have rather had Chick-fil-A at least their sides come out hot!</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Came here to get a burger and fries for a late lunch, we ended up having a wait time of over an hour to get our table which was completely understood since things are beginning to reopen.

Once we finally received the text that the table is ready, they sat us at a table/both. Which was not an issue at all. Our hostess was very quick and very helpful with the ordering and service. We started with ordering 2 sodas and 2 waters, once I got a second to look at appetizers I decided with some Mac N Cheese balls. Which I highly recommend they are delicious and hard to put down once you start eating them. They also come with honey mustard dipping sauce but recommend asking for the Tapatio ranch.

After sometime we finally ordered our burgers, myself I ordered the Bison Bacon burger. Great flavors, good size and filling. Was scared of the Jalapeño jam but turned out to just add more flavor and make the burger that little extra. My girl had decided to go with the BBB Bacon Burger. Was to much for her to finish but she took the leftovers home and had nothing but compliments for the burger. So food was extremely good and no complaints from either of us. So if ever looking for a good burger and good environment go head and stop here!!! You won't regret the choice to do so.< /Review>

My perfect lunch there is as follows, Literally any burger, sweet potato fries (no sauce needed), a pale ale, Mac'n'cheese balls as an appetizer and a water to cleanse the pallet. I highly recommend this place.<//Review>< Pics>

Our part of 7 waiting was horrible,  there was a family of 8 got seated before us and we had been waiting for 40 minutes. They didn't have reservations. They did was a little cold but it was good the price is reasonable. Hopefully next time I visit Fresno I get better timing on seating if I decide to go there.<//Text>

50% Angus beef & 50% bacon burger.  Top it off with all kinds of unique goodies if you like including MORE bacon or bacon infused ketchup etc.

<Text>This place is nice on the inside & the hostess was an amazing young lady!! It is a tad expensive. The food is okay. Different than what im used to. They have a PB & J burger that you just have to try!!
Our server wasnt too attentive. He was nice but I liked the hostess better. She has great customer skills.
This place isnt for me, but it just may be your next favorite!! Gotta at least try it once!!

<review>Great atmosphere, good beer selection, I really liked the Cornado orange wheat. Burgers are unique and very good. Get the sweet potato fries with the pumpkin dipping sauce, you won't be disappointed.</review>< Time>

Slaters 50/50 I am so happy its finally open because the food was worth every single dime. Very clean and staff was more than friendly and attentive to my needs. I wish you keep it up and you will be successful. Great job! ✌< /review>

< review>
Staff was friendly and helpful. Made a special request non-alcoholic beverage with mint, basil, grenadine and soda water that was excellent. Kudos!
Due to allergies to monosodium glutamate I can't eat ranch dressing. So I asked for it to be removed from a chicken bacon ranch burger. It was done without staff complaining but nothing was substituted such as mayo or possibly guacamole or bbq sauce. This made the bread dry and difficult to enjoy.
Sandwich was so large that I had to cut it in half (something I usually don't have to do). Afterwards it would not stay together and had to be eaten with a knife and fork.
While I don't think I will order that particular sandwich again,  I definitely would eat in Slater's 5050 again 😋<//review>

<text>Saturday Lunch service.

Wait time to sit down was great at 15 minutes on a Saturday afternoon.  Initial drink order happened quickly.   Starter of Jalapeño poppers were great, beer on tap was good, selection ok.

Burger and kids meal was slow on coming out.

A Michelada was subpar and took a long time to come back.  Server made rounds but kept skipping our table even tho we were out of drinks for a while.

We waited patiently and we're gracious but service was definitely on the lacking side for us.  Both food and drinks were slow to be served.  The place was not too busy.

Mask usage and social distance was good.

Food wise, everything we ordered was delicious.  No qualms about food but the service definitely could use improvements on speed.  Could be because they are newish to dining but seemed like better training was necessary for new staff.

As an example, when our main order came out, the server dropped it off but didn't ask if there was anything else. She was about to walk away until we stopped her to add another round of drinks.  The busser had taken the empty glasses (great) but when the food was dropped off by our main server a quick glance should have told her we didn't have drinks.  On top of that she didn't ask if we needed anything so had we not stopped to add refill of beer we would have had to wait x amount of time.  This last 'anything else' question is not just good service but also key to the business to up sales.

Three stars because the food is great, some work needed on service.<//text>< Pics>

We live about 1hr 30 min from Fresno It was my daughters 18 bday, she a big cheesecake lover so she wanted to go to the Cheesecake Factory, Thanks to the Cheesecake Factory having 3 rude hostess & wait over an hr and a half. We decided not to wait anymore so we went to try slaters 5050 I’m not sure what is going on but their hostess said the wait was about 10 mins it took them more like 5 mins, they had us seated drinks served. Megan our waitress was super nice was on top of everything. We never had to asked for refills she made sure we had it before we finished it. Manager from Cheesecake Factory might want to take notes from the slaters manager she came and introduced herself and ask how we were doing and to let her know if we needed anything. The pork nachos, jalapeño poppers ,Hamburgers , onions rings were all amazing. Glad we Changed our mind and went there great food great customer service.< /review>

For starters:
Slater's Vampire Dip (perfect ratio of artichoke, garlic, cheese flavor married well with the crispy pita chips. Loved that it was put in sourdough!!)
Garlic Parm Loaded Fries (ugh, roasted garlic heaven on fries! What more can I say?!? Not to mention their signature bacon ketchup. YUM!!!)

Main course:
Ahi Poke Salad (full salad large portion, very refreshing, came with a variety of toppings, flavor of ginger dressing was amazing)
Hi Brow Burger (my bf is a burger fanatic and he inhaled this burger. He raved about the perfectly cooked angus beef, fresh abundant bed of arugula, and delicious bacon jalapeño jam)
OG 50/50 Burger (my sister eats slower so she let me have a qtr of her burger lol. It was juicy with big chunks of avocado, crispy bacon, topped with a glorious egg!)

My only regret is that I forgot to take pictures! We were all way too excited to dig in as fast as we could lol. Service was exceptional, food was incredible, will definitely order again. Highly recommend this joint!!!< /Review><name>Donna E</name>< Date>

Finally this place is open! Everything we ordered was amazing. The staff was super friendly as well. I had the Lone Star Smoke burger and it was huge, especially with the thick onion rings that are stacked in the burger and brioche bun. It Waldo came with a side of fries, but I got it substituted for tater tots with garlic aioli dip.. so good! My friend has the sriracha burger and she loved it as well! For appetizers, we had the Vampire dip - a combination of roasted garlic, artichoke and cheese served in a bread bowl - this is a must try, trust me you wont’t regret it! And finally, for dessert, I had the s’mores milkshake. The shake was topped with a legit s’mores sandwich and toasted marshmallows. I’ve never seen such a great presentation! I’m definitely coming back to try more items on the menu. Everything we had were delicious and not only that, that food presentation was also pleasing. This restaurant is such a great addition to the food options we have in Fresno.<//Review>

< Review>
AMAZING! So excited to see this open in Fresno!

This place has it all and is 'over the top' good!

Food: Unique burgers with half bacon/half beef patty; savory flavor and perfectly packed within the buns and toppings. Sriracha burger and screamin' chicken sandwich were actually spicy with tasty sauces and cole slaw mix. Tots and fries were above par. Will have to try the rosemary turkey burger next.

Dessert: Over the top, literally, delicious and decorative. Kids of course loved the candy covered shake. We actually couldn't finish it.. a 1st for my sweet tooth.

Beverages: Really looking forward to coming back (perhaps without the kids) to enjoy the extensive bar menu and 'Untappd' mobile linked taps.

Service: Excellent. Server Aleah was super knowledgeable, friendly and patient. Met the owners; locals and so nice. The whole team was friendly and fun. COVID precautions in place; even sanitizer on our table. So glad to see a business open in this climate.

Location: Awesome location next to Cheesecake Factory. Lots of outdoor seating. Nice to see the huge Christmas tree outside the restaurant at the mall too.< /Review>

Took forever to get in, be served, get a glass of water, then my burger comes out overcooked and dried out!</Text>

Best burgers we've had in a long time. There's even a burger that you have to sign a waiver to eat. Too spicy for me. Friendly and welcoming environment. Indoor and outdoor dining.</Review>

I'll keep this simple. The fried chicken sandwich is possibly one of the best in SB. But that is no secret, and everyone knows. So the lines are also some of the worst lines you will encounter outside of Disneyland. I suggest going in late and hopefully, you will miss the crowd. Me, i will head over to other like establishments with shorter lines. Good luck, because again it is possibly the best!< /review>

Five stars if they wrote the sandwich # on the bags!
After 5 pm special is awesome!
Went back tonight 4/9 (covid sux) ...great service....they were handling a lot of delivery.  Well done!<//review>

<review>I like the sandwiches at Jersey Mike’s, but it’s really annoying that they give precedence to walk in customers over phone orders. On more than one occasion I have ordered early for pick up, go in at the correct time, and they haven’t even started my sandwich. People who walk in the door get served first while I stand there and wait.< /review>< Pictures>

The absolute best chain sandwich shop.  Locals might prefer south coast deli, three pickles, or pickles and swiss, but Jersey Mike's is just as good and universally available.< /review>

I think the employees at this store need a reminder of  basic customer service! If it weren't for the customers they would not have a job. Try acting like you are not totally put out that you had to make a sandwich, try talking to the person not mumble looking somewhere else. And Hey, what about a thank you when I have bought 8 sandwiches from you and you want a tip? Last time I will be going there.<//text>

This is the second time within a week we stopped by. We tried Hakka chicken Scallions Sauce, Salt Shredded Chicken, Hakka braised pork belly, fried intestines. Amazing taste and flavorful, good with rices. The price is not cheap but it is a large portion for each dish. Must try Hakka Braised Pork Belly, super tender, perfect mixed texture with the sweet & sour cabbage.<//Review>

Great Hakka cuisine. Not the Taiwanese hakka style a bit greasy. Braided pork is a must try. Staff is friendly. Not too many table in the restaurant. Business is good.<//Text>

Try here if nearby.

煎酿三宝 is good and tasty.

Chicken soup is good.

羊排煲 is kind of ok.. Lamb is a little old. But better after boiling.<//review>

As someone who's part Hakka I was so excited when I discovered there's a restaurant nearby! Everything is really good, I wish they serve frog legs and eels though. Still really worth visiting, the dishes are all excellent<//text>

Though I can’t say if this place truly serves authentic Hakka food because I’m no expert, but I can definitely tell you the food is great here. The Hakka hand pulled chicken was really good. The pan fried stuffed tofu looked real heavy and salty but it was actually well-balanced in terms of flavor. The braised pork belly with fried fish was very unique. There were bones in the fish but the meat itself was real fresh and juicy. Overall you won’t be disappointed if you give it a try.<//text>

<Review>This place was surprisingly good.  We came on a Friday night around 7pm and restaurant was full but we didn't have to wait for table.  We ordered stir fry choi sum, fried lutos roots, emperor chicken and combo fried noodle.  The Choi sum was my favorite dish, right about of saltiness and flavor.  The combo fried noodle was firm and enjoyable.  Their emperor chicken is their version of Hainanese chicken which was also tender and flavorful.

Located in shopping area with plenty of other restaurants and parking.

Very comfort food especially if you miss the Taiwanese local customer. Found this new gem that provided very good Taiwanese cuisine. Their salted bake chicken, braised pork meat in salted vege and braised beancurd stuffed with meat was really good and authentic. Small restaurant and can be packed during lunch time. Very friendly waiter and food is serving fast. Really love it and will come back again.< /Text>

Came here with wife for lunch. Being half Hakaka from Taiwan the food served here is not bad but not quite as authentic but the portion is generance as I remember from Grandma's cooking, thus a four stars.< /text>

So the special braised pork w/ brocolli was a new menu item that they said got good feedback, so we were happy to try it out.  It was really, really good.  I think for non-Asian people this would be a great choice that isn't so "exotic" as my non-Asian friends annoyingly still say.  The sauce is soy based, mildly sweet, and the pork we had was braised to perfection.  So easy to cut w/ a spoon or tear pieces off w/ a chopstick.  5/5.<//Text>

Not sure how this place gets so many stars. The food were so nasty. Only took two bites out of $40 worth of food. Threw all the food away what a waste of money. That will be my first and last order from here. Save your money and eat somewhere else!<//text>

<Review>Food here taste better than they look and that's a great thing. I really enjoyed the sticky rice and short ribs and the pan fried tofu. All of the flavor really sink in to the carbs. Saw a lot of people ordered the braised pork but I wasn't a fan. It turned out to be a bit dry and overly salty for me. Note: This place can get a bit busy during the weekends but the line generally move fast. This is also a good thing as the previous place had no wait (because their stuff wasn't good).</Review><rating>4<//rating></record></dataset><record>

Had to wait about 30mins so since we had a large party (8).  However the food was good. Try the pork and the vegetarian dishes, they were both very good. If coming on the weekend, plan accordingly since that's when there are large parties. They can seat a Max of 36 so it's a small place.< /text>

Everything I've tried is pretty good. The roast pork is very tender, pork rib flavorful, veggie dishes are good as well. The meat dishes are a bit on the salty side, but the veggie dishes balance it out.</text>

Food and service never disappoint me. Salt baked chicken(盐焗鸡) is the best. But my favorite is “Five points soup” (五指汤) made with authentic Hakka ingredients.<//review>

(Translated by Google) I tried the Hakka, Hakka dishes, in Fremont, Figure 1 is the eggplant garlic scallions, 🦐 a little unsatisfactory, an open back shrimp actually does not clean the shrimp line... but the garlic eggplant is delicious. The real name Tucao this oyster mushroom mushroom, oyster mushroom is difficult to chew, beef is not particularly cooked, it is particularly difficult to chew, but the taste can also be... fried milk although the skin is a bit ugly, but the sweet silk is very pleasant. Finally, the best garlic chicken, the meat is very soft and very tasty! Strong push!

尝试了一下客语，客家菜，在fremont，图1是茄子蒜香🦐，🦐有点不进味儿，一个开背虾居然不清理干净虾线…但是蒜蓉茄子很好吃。实名吐槽这个杏鲍菇牛柳，杏鲍菇就很难嚼了，牛肉不是特别熟，也特别难嚼，但是味道还可以…炸鲜奶虽然皮有点丑，但是甜丝丝的很让人愉悦。最后是最好吃的蒜香鸡，肉特别软也很入味儿！强推！< /text>

(Translated by Google) The taste is good, the meat melts in your mouth, and the scallion chicken is very tender. At the price of 17$ a dish, the portion is slightly smaller.

(Original)
味道不錯 扣肉入口即化 蔥油雞也很嫩。以17$一道菜的價位來看 份量稍少。< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) The store is very stingy for a meal of 1.99, and the amount of the meal is too small. It is only a half of a box. The teriyaki meat is terrible. Although the marinade tastes right, I haven't eaten such a simmered meat in this life! Like biting the bark, every time you bite your chin, you feel dislocated. I really think that during the SIP period, there may be other stores who are more attentive than they are. If they don’t have the heart, they will not eat again in the future. I am really disappointed...

(Original)
店家很小氣一份飯1.99，還飯量超少稍微壓一壓大概只有一盒的一半超傻眼。紅燒肉超可怕，雖然滷汁味道很對味，但這輩子完全沒吃過這麼柴這麼硬的焢肉！像在咬樹皮一樣，每咬一口下巴就覺得快脫臼了。真心覺得SIP期間可能會有其他店家比他們更用心在攬客，如果他們沒有心就算了，以後不會再去吃了，真的超失望....<//Text>< pics>

{'time': 1592166683821, 'text': '(Translated by Google) Thank you for your feedback. First of all, I want to explain that rice is a single serving, and we are serving uniformly. Braised pork is one of the signature dishes, and the mouthfeel should be that the entrance melts, fat but not greasy. Thank you for your feedback and let us know that there may be something wrong with this dish. We will investigate immediately to find out why. If it is convenient, please contact us on our website to help you make another copy. Thank you.\n\n(Original)\n謝謝您的反饋。首先想解釋米飯是一人份量，我們是統一份量裝的。紅燒肉是招牌菜之一，口感應該是入口即化，肥而不膩的感覺。謝謝您的反饋讓我們知道這道菜有可能出了問題。我們會馬上調查找出原因。如果方便，請您在我們的網站聯繫我們，以便幫您重新做一份。謝謝。'}< /Resp>

<text>(Translated by Google) Pepper pork belly chicken pot is highly recommended. Hakka makes tofu a standard, but it disappoints Sambo a bit.

(Original)
胡椒豬肚雞煲值得推薦，客家讓豆腐有水準，只不過讓三寶有點失望，所勾的芡太稠< /text><gmap_id>0x808fc76c42f1b807:0xba5f025938a869b5<//gmap_id>< Rating>

(Translated by Google) Very satisfied! ! ! Both onion chicken and fried milk are very similar to the ones eaten in Guangzhou, and the price is not expensive. The waiter is also very friendly and will introduce some special dishes.

I have been going here for years, the eyebrow services are bomb, so are the nails and feet, but DO NOT get your eyelashes done here!! It seems they have hired an untrained person who applies a strong smelling glue, smells like nail glue on the lashes. The eyelashes are poor quality, feels plastic and has made MANY of my eyelashes fall out.

The lady would stop and wax lip and eyebrows in between applying my lashes also..the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because all of the other services are great..but you will be sad about your eyelashes falling out.< /Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>The worst place ever to get a pedicure. My first and last time.
1) They don’t use the sanitizer bags that are used today.
2) They don’t put anything in the water  for example spa mineral salt or even soap.
3) They don’t use cuticle softener.😲 instead they use rose lotion.
The price was $20.00 with additional $5 for callouse remover. Which he put  on a plumice stone and added soft soap to.  When I questioned him about doing that and not washing my feet off with soap and water after the callous remover he looked shocked.to.  He then scrapped the stone on the jet in the spa tub which is so unsanitary.  I pray I don’t get a fungus. They seem to be popular for waxing. But as far as a pedicure DON’T  WASTE YOUR $</Review>< Pics>

It's not worth even one star. Went in today with my mom for the first time here for pedicure and it was hands down the worst experience in my life. The lady that did my nails kept leaving to finish a manicure and when she came back she just put some lotion on my feet and applied clear coat. No cutticle cut whatsoever, she completly forgat she didn't cut my nails or cleaned them on my left foot. I still have dead skin and cuttlicles untouched. The price shows $20 and she charges $25. DO NOT GO HERE unless you want to pay for nothing.< /review>

This American tire depot is the best. The manager Al, is extremely professional.  Just came in for an oil change and a tire rotation and i was in and out in 10 mins. I also purchased 4 new tires about a year and a half ago and this is the first set that has worn evenly thanks to the attention and willingness to go above and beyond by Al and his team of pros.</Text>

Very helpful, knowledgeable and quick!  Came by just to have a quick check on my tires and an estimate and they were able to take care of my car right then.  Was told an hour and it was just that!  Have been a long time costumer of this location and have never been disappointed with the service provided on all 6 of the vehicles in our family!< /Review>

Had a blowout the other day and called to get my tire replaced. Spoke with Al and he got our tire in the next day with stellar customer service! Awesome attitude and very personable. Definitely going back for any tire needs. Great prices and great staff!< /text>

Guys here are honest and reliable. Came in to get my tires balanced because Redlands 1 couldn't balance my tires 🙃😑 . They didn't say that but as soon as I left there shop I noticed my steering wheel vibrating.  I guess they don't balance there tires there when you pay for new tires and mount and balance. Redlands 2 earn my business thank you guys .</Review>

<review>This is the place to go to get tires!!! Simply the best service, Al was the first person I met on the phone when I called. He told me the price over the phone and he was honest and more than fair with me. They tell when it will be ready and they are very efficient and gave excellent customer service. It’s nice going to a tire shop where you can actually trust them and leave feeling good.  If you want good service this is the place to go. Ask for Al , he was excellent!!!<//review>< Pictures>

<review>I had a negative experience getting turned away from Firestone in San Bernardino an hour & 20 minutes before their closing time with wires exposed (driving around my toddler) because they wanted to go home early. American Tire Depot off Redlands Blvd took me in at their actual closing time with NO hesitation! Al & Adam were quick to tell me to come in and that they would help me out. They were better priced and fast! Thank you!< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
So the other day I noticed other say my tire was loosing air even after air was put in it :( So I took it down here to get my tire checked. Turns out my tire had a nail in it . It was fixed and a tire alignment was recommended, so we did that also. Everything was taken care of so quickly, I am so grateful! My husband and I are both first responders and need our vehicles to get to work, so this was such a relief knowing it was taken care of and we’d be safe on the road . I was also offered to try an oil change next time I need it. I was so impressed by the staff and work ethic by this crew I will be bringing in both of my vehicles for all my tire needs now and oil changes. Great customer service goes a long way for my husband and I and we appreciate this location for being so kind and efficient. Thanks! Mr. and Mrs. Villalpando< /Review>

I walked in with a certain wheel/tire combination, but after speaking to Al, I was convinced that I would be better served with just getting tires for my truck. After some diligent work, we found the right tire. Once they were installed, it was exactly what I wanted! Great staff and guiding the customer to make a good choice instead of just trying to sell everything a customer may not want or need was refreshing!< /review>

I limped back to Redlands and stopped here to order a tire. My expectations were that I would put in an order, come back the next day, have my tire installed and then get on with my day. That is definitely not what happened here.

I was greeted with what, during these mask times, I can assume was a smile. I was told that a driver would go to their warehouse, pick up my tire and come back, and then I could be on my way. I had barely waited half an hour before I was out the door. Of course, your times will vary with the weight but this was definitely more than I expected. I will be very happy to return and give these guys my business. I am always happy to pay for quality service. Check out my other reviews and you will see that they are very fair.</Review></record>

I went in for tires for my truck and Al helped me out. He was truly professional and genuine and I came back to have them put tires on my wife's car. I got there when they opened saturday morning spoke to Al and he got me hooked up and done by 10am...truly professional and friendly. You will leave there feeling safe and confident because they take care of you...I will go back and highly recommend!!!<//Review>

<text>Great service, good price, and quick work. My only gripe is that one person in the shop didn't have a mask on both times I was there. 😑 They also had customers coming in without masks. No air flow in the room so it felt unsafe. Otherwise a good visit and service.< /text>< resp>

Very surprised,  not like other tire places. Got my tires installed and alignment fast.. I was blown away, when they installed chrome stems and caps on my valve stems. They stolen on previous tires. They also had best price on tires. Thank you for excellence customer service. Thank you service Mgr.< /Text>

<text>I spoke w manager in the beginning. I apologize for not remembering his name. However, what’s important is....

He quoted priced and ordered tires for me only to realize that their warehouse had old 2019 tires which isn’t what I ordered let alone for them to sell me. I dropped off my car only to be called w in minutes of leaving there to tell me the warehouse screw up. So he offered me another type of tire same price etc. and apologized greatly. I believed in his wrd and he didn’t steer me wrong, no pun intended !
As a female, tires are not my thing, but these boys? Are looking AWSOME ON MY CAR! Thank you all for your help and not misleading a female down the wrong road w price and all.

The tires look AWSOME!!! Want two more!!!</text><Date>1616042479023< /Date>< gmap_id>

Staff were extremely helpful and quick, checked two tires that I was concerned had a nail or puncture. Offered to put air in right away if that was all I needed so that I could be on my way without having to wait. But I still got out in under an hour. And no charge! Highly recommend!<//Review>

I got wheels and tires from American Tire Depot for a significantly lower price than all other shops I called. All the employees were very nice and helpful. Will definitely be going back and would recommend them to anybody.< /review>

I was greeted in the parking lot by the manager Alberto. We discussed my needs and he assured me that they could complete the task in ASAP. The tire technician Joseph Allen was very knowledgeable and efficient.  Overall good job Redlands 2.</text>

Staff is always super friendly. I bought tires here about 3 yrs ago for two of my vehicles and it was not a hassle.  I told them the tires I wanted and they even helped me get rebates.  I have never made an appointment to get my cars serviced and they have always been able to accommodate me.  I love that they don’t take long to service the cars unlike the dealerships who sometimes take 4-5 hrs.</review>

I had bought 2 new tires there about 7 months ago. Jacob quoted me a good price on the tire. They did the tire rotation, put on the new tire, did a wheel alignment. They also checked my brakes and fluids which were good. They asked me if I needed an oil change. I did not because I have 5,000 more miles to go. They took really good care of me as always.

I went to American Tire Depot to have my brake light Replaced. They took absolute care of me. Their customer service was impeccable. Jacob took real good care of me he made me feel comfortable and relieved. You can trust them to handle anything for your vehicle. I highly recommended them to anyone. I will be going back for any of my cars needs.< /Text>

<Text>After checking several locations my tire size wasn't readily available or was difficult to get a quote. Called Redlands ATD for a price and they matched exactly what they advertised. Adam ordered my tires and Edward installed them all in the same day. My 3rd set of tires purchased from ATD and always satisfied with price and service.<//Text><rating>5</rating>< Gmap_id>

Heard the tick-tick-tick sound of a nail in my rear tire and went to the nearest shop - I'm glad it happened to be American Tire Depot (II)! Jacob and his team quickly took care of things and I was back on the road in no more than 10-15 minutes. I'm just about at the wear bars, so I'll be back soon for a fresh set of tires. Very satisfied new customer here.<//text>

They did a really good job, the only drawback was there was a mixup with paperwork. I know that happens as we are all human. That was taken care of very quickly. Not sure if I was supposed to get any paperwork on my tires, but I didn’t receive any. The workers, the people there were very nice!< /Review>

<Review>This is the only shop I will go for my vehicle. I almost blew my engine, but the manager Jacob found the issue right on time. Along with fixing a host of other issues on my vehicle. I saved so much money and everyone was very professional. They ensured a great experience, and I hate vehicle maintenance time. I appreciate the employees @ American Tire Depot and their hard work on keeping our vehicles running safe,  and through the pandemic and everything else going on!</Review>< pictures>

Took two cars in for tire repairs.  They have fixed nails in tires for me several times at no charge.  This time one vehicle I knew needed tires, and got a good deal on 70,000 mile tires on a buyer get one free deal.  Dropped off in the AM and picked up after work at 4pm.  My SUV ended up with tire damage that could not be repaired this time, so I also got a buy three get one free deal on that, installed and aligned same day I took it in..  Felt like two fair deals and they had taken care of me over a couple years so was glad to give my business to them.  Deal includes tire rotation regularly so I can keep these going for another 50,000 to 70,000 miles...</Text>

Took my truck here after the first tire shop claimed to have fixed my tire leak (first shop did not fix the leak). Claimed they found a nail and fixed the leak. I had the exact same leak. I am a experienced mechanic but out of state so don’t have access to the proper tools. Took me 30 sec to find the actual leak after they claimed they fixed it. Please don’t waste people’s time.<//Review>

I would have given more stars, but there was no mention of what was fixed on my tire in the paperwork. There was zero sanitizer on the counter (had to sign 3 times) air conditioning seemed to be not working properly. During covid, your cars touched surfaces should be sanitized and advise customers. Lastly, my car was parked in front,  door unlocked, keys on the seat. Never a good idea in any city.  Good customer service otherwise, was the 3 stars.<//review>

<review>I was so grateful and impressed with this company because they removed a nail from my tire, patched it up, and refused to take a dime for it, saying only “It’s a service that we are happy to provide, just keep us in mind for your next tire change!” Wow!

Rude and unhelpful. Made an appointment and bought the tires before hand. Apparently I bought the wrong tires which they told me after they took the wheels off. They never told me the right tire size for my car and didn't gave me any options for tires. They just told me to pick up my car. I guess I'll figure out what kind of tires my car has and go somewhere else.</Text>

<Text>Called America Tire Depot in Redlands, CA to get pricing on a specific LT (Light Truck) tire for my RAM 1500 Laramie with 20” rims. They were able  beat the price of other distributors. They had to order the tires in, due to my specific request and had them installed the next day. The tire technician was professional and completed the installation timely and correctly, taking great care in his work. I would recommend their performance to anyone needing tires or specialty tires like my request. Great job!<//Text>< username>

Came in with a flat. The tires were the original 2014 and the fronts were worn. The hooked me up with four new Michelin’s and road warranty plus an alignment. Couldn’t beat there price anywhere!! Customer service was awesome! I’m taking all my business there!< /review>

<Text>Quick service, great price and very professional service.  They suggested what maintenance I needed but didn’t pressure me in any way in fact offered a great price if I return to have the service done at a later date. I ordered the tires (great price) had them ready the next day less than 24 hours and were done in an hour.  Very satisfied!!< /Text>< Pics>

It means they have tires.
They fill them with a gas instead of air and charge you $ for that.
They also charge $25 for tire insurance on each tire totalling $100+ sales tax, but won't display that fact until after you sign and pay, so basically I bought a tire in case one goes bad before the insurance expires so be careful and don't worry about tire insurance because if one does go bad it will cost you the same amount and if it doesn't, you save a 💯 to buy your next set.<//review>< rating>

Alex and the staff were quick on point and directly to the point. They were all awesome and super helpful and hilarious. I'd highly recommend this shop to those who need to pay for tires but enjoy actually giving up their cash lol< /text>

This place is the real deal. I went to Costco to get a tire change and rotation, and they were going to charge me $500 for two tires. Came here and they only charged $394, and that included and alignment, which Costco does not provide.

Not only was the service great and affordable, they treat you like a person and look out for your best interests.<//review>

Went in looking for 315/75R16 Cooper Discoverer STT Pros. There were only 5 left in California of that size apparently. This shop got them in for me even earlier than expected and had a quick install along with it. Cheaper than all the other shops i went to. Thanks again!<//review>

Staff was very informative and friendly, not to mention quick. I had a bent rim that made it difficult for a new tire to grip bead, but the associate ( Kevin I think was his name ) went out of his way to make sure he could get the bend out and get the tire on. I give him alot of credit for all the work he put in. Very good experience, I would definitely recommend and go back when I need the other two tires done. Great job! 5 stars from me.< /text>

Albert who did the tire job was great,  started and finished the job timely and didn't take his time which other tire locations do to charge more for labor. Albert was very professional. Gary who did the oil change was great too, didn't try to sell me things I didn't need did the job that was asked and completed in a short time. Brad the manager was also good to work with, he gave me a quote and it didn't change. I will continue to go to only this location in the future. Great customer service and honest people to work with</text>< pics>

<Text>The men who work here are great. No other place would accept a customer ten minutes to closing, but they did. I had a bad flat tire and they went above and beyond for me, staying open an extra thirty minutes to help me. Alex G. offered me a great deal and Spencer and the rest of the crew took care of my car better than any other place I know. I highly reccommend this place, if not for the customer service alone. They did not have to help me, they chose to. For me, that speaks volumes.<//Text><Name>Katie McKiddy</Name></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Waited 13 weeks to write my review because I was very skeptical of the great deal received.

I originally priced my tires through Costco and their price was great with the additional $70 rebate for purchasing four Michelin tires.  The drawback was Costco's extremely long wait; over two weeks for installation.  One of my tires developed a bulge which made it undrivable.

I googled tire shops in my area and found American Tire Depot about 5 minutes away.  Decided to call first and Brian answered.  I was straightforward and told him what Costco was charging and about the rebate.  He quoted me a fantastic price and told me the rebate was available from American Tire Depot as well.  It would take an extra day to have my tires delivered.  Went the next day and had them installed quickly.

However, a couple of days later I noticed one of my tires had a flat.  I immediately inflated my tire at home, called back Brian and told him the issue, and went back to the shop right away.  Waited about an hour to find out it was a defective valve stem.  Fixed at no additional charge.

Back to the 13 week wait...I originally had difficulty applying for the rebate because they took it off their website.  Emailed customer service and they made it available again.  Applied for the rebate and was told to wait 8 to 10 weeks.  When 10 weeks passed, I was starting to think that the tire deal wasn't so great after all.

All of a sudden, I received an email to expect my rebate in the mail and a few days later it arrived. I'm very happy with the great customer service provided thought and would not hesitate to recommend this shop to friends and family.  Thanks.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Had an appointment to install 4 new tires at the Colton Ave location. When I arrived that location was closed. Called the Redlands Blvd location and was told to would be helped there. Even though they were swamped with customers they promised my tires woukd be installed later that day. And they followed through on their promise. Great service by manager.

<text>I had Alex helping me. His a pretty good guy, there was a lot going on apparently with being under staffed and some issue with their other store, but Alex took the extra pressure, work load,  and  servicing the customers like a professional. He gets 5 stars and gave me a good price on tires. The other employees get -2 stars. They are completely unperfessional and disorganized.
- Took 2 and half hrs to get 4 tires and alignment. Agian they were under staffed that day, but that doesn't explain the rest.
- I saw one worker smoking on the job.
- After 1.5hrs Alex asked about my car and they had no idea that the tires I needed where already there he had to point them out.
- They seem to be rude and disrespectful to managment. Ignoring Alex, even refusing to help him by simply picking up a call.
- My car was done, pulled up, keys turned in. Alex asked if they had checked the alignment. They had forgotten to do that, so I had to wait again.
- They were only suppose to check the alignment but they must have gone ahead and done it anyway without my permission since Alex said he wouldn't charge me for it.

I hope Alex finds a better place to work and I'll be looking for a better place to get tires.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_name>H2 T2</user_name>< Rate>

This is a typical tire place.  The staff were somewhat knowledgeable and were able to look up what tires fit my car.  I was told I was receiving a discount on the final price, but their "deal" was $10 off.  I got the tires I was sold and they were balanced and put on the car.  Only other issue was they didn't bother to clean up the tires as they had scuff marks on the side wall.  Basically, don't expect red carpet service here.</review>

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE HERE! I scheduled an appointment to have new tires installed. Agreed to a tire size and price the day before the appointment. On the day of the appointment they informed me that they did not have the correct tires we ordered so they provided a better alternative for the same price. not so bad, right? After the tires were installed they informed me that there was a lot of work needed on my car, needing new A-arms, brakes and struts. I declined the work as i  perform these items myself. The next day I went to remove the wheels from the car. The tire depot cross threaded one of the studs holding the wheel and over-torqued the other lug nuts so much that the studs sheared off during removal! I then inspected the items they said needed replacement and found the work was not even required. these guys are super nice when you speak to them buy they are total crooks! thanks for a big headache Tire Depot.<//Review>

<Text>Doesn't matter how early you get there you always will wait at least an hour. Double check that your request are met. 2x I had to go back to request the stick weights be used instead of the rim weights. Had chrome sleeves and caps and they were left off once.

< Review>
Our tire blew out on the way to Big Bear recently. We had a car full of stuff and a fussy baby so I was feeling stressed. I called the center that installed my tires in Huntington Beach and they recommended calling the nearest store to get our tire replaced under warranty. The location on Colton Ave was too busy to help us for at least 90 minutes. We drove a few minutes to this one and I'm glad we did. Charles helped us get in and out within 15 minutes. They replaced our tire with an even better quality tire because they didn't have any of our original matching brand. He also filled all our tires with air and checked the instruments on our car to make sure we didn't have any other issues on our way up. All we had to cover were tire disposal fees and a small service fee.

Charles was very friendly and made our stop quick and relatively hassle-free, considering. I would recommend them because they really do honor their warranty.< /Review>

I showed my receipt when they  installed new set of tires which showed their phone number. He told me they couldn't fix the problem and he didn't get any phone calls. He lied because I recognized his voice and he even called me dear on the phone and in the shop so I know he was lying. I called the number on the receipt he said I must have called the other shop on Colton impossible I didn't know about the other store.

< Review>
Management here is horrendous. I was harrassed by Josh, as soon as I walked in, his behavior was insulting and had a degrading attitude against me. I was trying to explain I needed tires replaced under hazardous insurance and was here last week, his response; " you are not covered, guess why the person who told you you were is no longer here? Because he wasn't following the policy!". He said hazardous insurance did not cover the damage because of multiple excuses he mentioned and sent me off. Luckily I drove to the Colton branch and they serviced my car the same day and the customer service was great.< /Review>

Prices seemed fair but when I pulled in I over heard the employee (Jose Delgado?) Loudly aguring with customers then flipping them off as they pulled away not very professional and made me leave because I sure didn't want to be treated that way. Went to Tire Pros instead and was treated in a very professional manner I recommend there instead.<//Review>

Took my Jeep in for tire rotation & a nail in the tire. Had an appointment for 11am. Was told that it would take about an hour. It took them 1&1/2 hours to rotate & fix a flat. the Jeep sat on the rack for 1/2 hour with nothing being done. It seems like they already have my money so take care of the paying customers first. When I questioned why it took so long the gentleman I spoke with got an attitude.</text>

<text>I think they are reasonable on price and go out of there way for costomers. I have been taking cars there for years. I think they are good at explaining options on problems and don't try to fix things that need to be fixed. My personal opinion as of today is that they are very trustworthy. They have gotten me rides home. When I get my oil changed there they check what needs to be checked and add what needs to be topped off. I leave work at piece of mind knowing they are honest and don't try to take advantage. My white GMC has over 280,000 miles. Original engine and transmission.</text><user>116896007316581326990< /user>< Rating>

Called beforehand to see if a tire was in stock, which they said was. I drop the car off and get back at closing time and see a bill for 150 more than I was expecting. Their response, "Your tire was out of stock so we gave you a discounted upgrade." They also hand me a Goodyear rebate form for $70 dollars.

I get home, the rebate is expired. I go and look up the tires they gave me, and yes they are nice tires that can handle high speeds. I drive a 1.6L Kia Rio. . . it doesn't need tires rated to 149 MPH. Plus if its rated higher which means it has softer rubber which wears out faster. . . now I have tires with warranty to 50K miles rather than 65K or 80k.

In the end my wife was happy with the tires, and felt "safer" with goodyears. . . (I think she just wanted to drive her new (used) car sooner rather than later. . .

Simply put, annoyed. I will chalk it up to a learning experience to make things exquisitely clear to tire shops in the future.< /Text>

<review>Went to get a slow leak patched. Waited for an hour, which was fine, I didn't have an appointment. However when it was time to pay, the guy that was working on my car brought me outside and said this was kind of a side job, and then asked for cash. I don't carry cash, so he had me go to the gas station next door to use the atm. Needless to say I won't be going back.<//review>< name>

American Tire Depot is one of the best places hands down to get your tires. They almost always have the lowest prices, they almost always have some sort of promotion going on and their staff are super helpful. They are extremely knowledgeable about all the products and services they provide. They can be a little pushy when it comes to option services like lifetime alignment or road hazard warranties, but I've purchased the road hazard warranty before and there was absolutely no muss no fuss when I needed to get my tires repaired. Highly recommend these guys to anyone needing tires.

I just came in because our new vehicle had a nail in one of the tires and they patched it up at no cost! These guys are great I can't emphasize enough why you should come to them for all your tire needs!< /review>

<name>JeffreyBowens</name><Text>The guys here seem to be very service oriented but when I went in to get my tires checked and get pricing on new ones they were almost rushing me to buy tires. I ended up taking my car down to America's Tire's and they told me that I didn't need new tires and to come back next time to get them checked out. I really am disappointed because I could've wasted a lot of money on tires I didn't even need.</Text><userid>117887826808371831071<//userid></record>

<text>Probably the most honest place in town. I came because Econo Lube told me I needed new brakes which sounded fishy since they were about a year old. Came here and after a few minutes they said I didn't need them. They just needed some tweaking and cleaning. Boom! Worked like new, no more terrible noise, they wouldn't even take my money. The whole team is super nice. We've been here tons of times, they might not always be the cheapest game in town but they've got a customer for life.

Bring your own entertainment though LOL, their waiting room entertainment leaves something to be desired.</text><user_id>103404615377978661236</user_id><rating>5<//rating>< Gmap_id>

<Text>They always wasted my time by not finishing the work as they promised. They always try to rip me off by suggesting unnecessary fixes. I am tired of their sneaky business style during last 4 visits. Just don't go there if you think your time and money are valuable. The 5 stars reviews here might be posted by their employees.

UPDATE some days after my original review: They've really taken my negative review into consideration and taken some actions at the corporate level. Today, I heard new manager took over this branch. Thus, I need to bump up the starts from 1 to 4. One is still down due to the negative experience with former manager.</Text>< pictures>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>This American Tire Depot Redlands ll,1139 W. Redlands Blvd, Redlands, Ca 92373 is a business I well avoid when shopping for tires in the future. Today, June 11,2011 this store mounted two new tires and balanced all four wheels, including a front-end alignment. As I was taking care of the bill I observed an employee moving my truck out of the shop to the parking lot I noticed the right rear wheel rotating in a whobbly manner like it was about to fall off the truck. I checked myself to see what was causing the problem, there was only 3 lugnuts loosely installed with 2 lugnuts missing. The employee gave me two lugs to install. Keep in mind I was about to pay for the work they performed when I  saw the whobbling wheel, maybe 5 minutes from driving my truck down the road. The manager had nothing to say and did not charge for the work.  There is no excuse for the lack of professionalism. I will take my business elsewhere, a place that can be trusted. I can't give this store any type of positive rating. The only reason it gets one star is so this we'll get posted</Text>< pictures>

They rushed my order and the tech that rotated my tires cross threaded my luggage nuts. He over torqued them. And today as I was working my brakes today, in my attempt to remove the lug nuts, my studs striped.

It still took 3 1/2 hours to do the work. Meanwhile some couple brought their jeep in for 4 new tires about 30 minutes after I got there, and they left before me! How does a tire shop remove 4 tires, unmount them from the rims, remount new tires to the rims, balance all 4 of them and put them back on the car in less time than rotating 4 existing tires and a computerized alignment? Again, its not like I didn't have an appointment, or I could excuse being worked on in any order they felt like.

2) Place had my car on two floor jacks to take off two tires at a time (same side at time), and the employee apparently thought that on the left side he couldn't be seen. So he takes the front tire off, rolls it back to the rear, takes the rear tire off, puts the rear tire back on the rear, and rolls the front tire back to the front and puts it back on. I've been standing outside watching the employee the whole time work on my car and the front tire he rolled back to the rear was not put on the rear. That's not a tire rotation. When I mention it to the manager, he questions the employee who says he did the rotation. To be fair, the manager did offer to make him do it again, but my point was that the employee didn't do the work, then lied about it. Whether the manager gets the work done correctly is now besides the point, I can no longer trust this place ever again. How much other work do they not do because they think the customer is not looking?

3) The alignment took a long time  to do because of apparent equipment issues and had to be done at least twice. And then the technician had all kinds of difficulties adjusting the fronts to be aligned. I'm hoping my car isn't worse off than when I brought it in.

4) After the alignment was completed they released my vehicle back to me saying I was done. I asked them what the tire pressures were set to (see #5). So back to the surly dishonest employee who says 35psi. Except these are LT tires on a 3/4 ton SUV, so that's not what they should be set to. So then he says he set it to whatever the door said. I mention that he said 35psi first so which is it because I want to make sure its done right and he stomps off and says he's "done talking to me" and gets some other manager. At least the manager took the time to not only make sure the tires were set correctly, but he also took the time to reset all the TPMS sensors which wasn't done by the surly employee.

The management here needs to release employees who are having a bad day to go home, rather than having these employees be rude, disrespectful and dishonest to customers. I think a customer would rather the job take longer and be done by fewer honest hard working employees and be done right, than deal with employees who are damaging to the reputation of the business and giving the customer a bad impression of the business.

5) No paperwork. I wasn't given so much as a receipt for what was done, or copies of any alignment documentation before or after. I've been to other tire stores and they always give you paperwork for your records documenting everything about your car when it comes in (mileage, existing tire pressures, etc).

If you want tires cheap, come here. But when it comes time for those services that come with that tire purchase, go somewhere else. I only came here because they sold the BF Goodrich tires I wanted for my vehicle. I'm going to find another place that sells BF Goodrich and doesn't put the customer through a bad experience when it comes time for services.

There's about 6 other tire places inside of a mile from this one. Do yourself a favor and take your business to one of them. They are more likely to do the work you ask them to do, less likely to lie about things, and less likely to have you there for over 3 hours for what should be an hours worth of work, tops.< /text>< Pictures>
