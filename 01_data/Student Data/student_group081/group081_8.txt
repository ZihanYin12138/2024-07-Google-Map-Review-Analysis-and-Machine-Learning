<rating>5< /rating><text>Outstanding craft cocktails and great atmosphere with friendly service. Highly recommended.

Found it on Google - wasn’t disappointed.

My wife and I went on a Friday night after dinner. Mostly a 30’s crowd - some younger some older. The bar is the main attraction and they deliver - outstanding custom craft drinks with a super friendly staff.

They also have several ‘off menu’ rare whiskey’s, rye’s and bourbon’s.

Bartender’s have a deep knowledge of their craft and they take it seriously.<//text>< Pics>

As a strictly cocktail bar, they're very focused on menu. It covers the ryes, rums, gins, etc but came across overly limited.

Everyone was friendly with skill. I did the American trilogy which was balanced well.

For a date night closer or starter, or otherwise friend hang out for good cocktails would go here.<//review>< Pictures>

People lining up around the corner, no parking,  hour long wait before getting a seat.  Well that is called a sign of what's to come.

Photo is of the aftermath of our massive meal.  Ate like a Mexican king and still food left over.

Great salsa bar, great booze at the bar, great food. Reasonable prices!</Review>

<Text>This is my FAVORITE Bibo Ergo Sum Bar! They have great happy hour specials and they recently extended their happy hour from 5-8pm. If you enjoy Bibo Ergo Sum bars (not for everyone I understand) definitely check this place out! Try the Chief Lapu Lapu or the Eastern Sour.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I've been here twice over 6+ months. My first experience was literally amazing - from experiencing the very awesomely decorated venue, the front bartender, down to most of the food we ordered. I must say though, my recent visit left me extremely disappointed as they seemed to have removed a great deal from their menu - and quite a few of my favorite items at that.< /Text>

Extremely disappointed! This has been my favorite restaurant, however tonight I have been so disappointed. We came early and ended up parking outside the parking and just walked in. By the time we came back out, the back gate was closed. As we were walking down the stairs we watched the valet guy open the gate for a car. Yet when we came down, we asked if he could open the gate so we could walk out and he refused! Made us walk all the way around the block, just because he was mad that we did not valet! After a great dinner, he was so rude, which ruined the whole evening. I really hope no other customers have to encounter such terrible treatment after spending their money here.<//Review>

My favorite Brazilian bbq place in Los Angeles area. Bibo bar is always fresh and clean with lots of varieties. Of course their cheese balls are the best. Meat quality is pretty good  but their roasted pineapple is my ultimate favorite. Good service through out and a nice place for date nite out.< /text>

<Text>This place brings me right back to the Nashville music scene, the band is super enthusiastic. The guitar player was awesome even though the speaker quality wasn't the best. Old school funk and blues mixed in a dose of country here and there. Definitely a lot of fun.</Text></record></dataset><record>

If you've read or seen the film 'The Prestige', you'll be a fan of this slightly hidden from sight cocktail bar located in the newly renovated Robertson Plaza.

The cocktail menu is separated into the three parts of a magic trick - The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige. The Pledge focuses on the seemingly normal with slight variation made to the classics. The Turn transforms the seemingly normal to the extraordinary by turning the twist up a notch. The Prestige is the culminating final act that combines the lessons of the first two acts and spins up something even more grandeur; cocktails on this page focus on layering unique ingredients together to create a complex palette.

Behind the scenes, all the best practices of composing a standard craft cocktail follow. This includes the chilled glassware, the chipping away of large chunks of clear ice, and the right aromatic toppings.

The interior is beautifully decorated and follows an art deco look. Beautiful lighting decorate the cabinet fixtures and ceiling.

I had the Sing Sing from the Prestige page, which based on the name & ingredients seemed to be an evolution of the Singapore Sling. Unlike the usual sweetness of the Sling, the Sing balanced the taste and packed quite a punch. It was a refreshing kick to start the evening.</text>

Sure. I spent over $100. But wow the atmosphere was so great. It felt like I was in a spongebob episode. 10/10. Drinks 10/10. This Chex mix with ruffle lays 10/10.< /Review>

5 stars for drinks
3 stars for service

Drinks were tasty and the interior was cute, but it took SO long to order and receive our cocktails...</review>

It's tiny and dark - real good speak easy feel to it.
The drinks are super strong, the staff is so amazing and they have kareoke/trivia nights.
Oh and did I mention they have food?? Rosemary garlic fries and chicken strips help me not be a mess the next day
Try the "bubble rainbow bunny"- super sweet and cant be beat- 2 of those and I will be singing kareoke =< /text>< pics>

<review>Bibo Ergo Sum is my favorite bar in LA - not only do they serve the best Manhattan I've ever had, the bar feels, at the same moment, like a time capsule and also a glowing example of modern art deco design. Just the nicest bartenders serving delicious cocktails hand-crafted with love in one of the most beautiful interiors in a city known for beautiful interiors.< /review>< Pics>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>Bibo is hands down my favorite cocktail bar in this part of town! Yes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I really dig the ambiance and the art deco decor. The entrance is semi-hidden, tucked away in the corner of a plaza. Can't speak too much about the food, but I would recommend nearly every drink I've had here. The drink menu is really quite creative the way the drinks are organized. Staff is knowledgable as well and can give great recommendations if you're unsure of what to order.

Note that they also have a stellar happy hour weekdays from 5-7pm with $6 martinis and $8 wines. When they first opened a bit over a year ago it was never too crowded, but it seems like more and more people have been stopping by as of late. I guess the secret is out!< /Review><Name>Hettie Mcneely</Name>< Time>

{'time': 1582092999558, 'text': 'Hey Kayla!!! Thanks for the review. I always appreciate the time it takes. With regards to pricing getting "high," I actually think our prices are great! For anywhere! For Happy Hour, we offer 50% off (great) beer and wine, $6 gimlets (gin or vodka) and $8 Old Fashioneds. On our current cocktail list, prices begin at $12 and top out at $15. I can\'t think of another cocktail bar in the area with that quality and pricing combination. Message me when you come back in, I want to introduce you to some of our "prices." :) Cheers!'}</Resp>

It appears the modification turmoil is almost complete.  It has been my pleasure during my last two or three visits to interface with management, civil servants, and the contractor staff all appear to have the customers in mind while performing their duties.one of the contractors has been extremely helpful.  The meat department butchers are alway helpful.  Checkout is also done in a friendly helpful manner.  You can't match Ft Irwin or Nellis but your ahead of Edwards.  Good job.<//Text>

<Text>Honestly just avoid this T-Mobile. They don’t even know what they are doing, they don’t know what promotions they have. They try to scam you into paying more than what you need too. Please have them explain everything to you thoroughly or they will sneak in some hidden fees.</Text>< Pictures>

Horrible store and customer service - avoid at all costs! Andrew, the store manager, is extremely unprofessional and rude. My mom went in to add a line to her account and purchase 2 phones. She's elderly and has memory problems and ended up getting the wrong phones on accident. I called the store 2 hours after the purchase and they refused to let us exchange the phones without a ridiculous "restocking fee" that no one else in the electronics industry imposes - not Apple, not Best Buy, not Costco, not Target, NO ONE! He kept giving us text book answers and when my mom said we would go in person to discuss it further instead of over the phone, he threatened to call the cops if we came. Are you kidding me? Andrew - you are joke to T-Mobile and I will be sure that corporate is aware of your business practices so they can replace you with a manager that is professional, cares about their loyal customers, and customer service training.<//Text>

< Review>
Went in to switch our lines and we were helped by the most kind hearted and amazing people Hector and Wendi, both of them were extremely helpful and knowledgeable with all of our concerns. They made our experience enjoyable and honestly it's so hard to find people now a day's with great customer service skills and I must say that both Hector and Wendi went beyond to meet our expectations, will definitely recommend stopping by and asking for them if you need help with anything!<//Review>

If your looking for good customer service don't come to this place. Associates have no training and don't know how to provide good customer service. I know the customer may not always be right because there is policies and rules that need to be followed but there's no need to be rude or aggressive with the customers. If you work here and you're reading this review check yourself and your coworkers. It's not hard to provide good customer service even if the customer is upset I should know I work in retail!<//Text>

<Review>Wow, I had never felt less in a T-Mobile shop like this one today ! Today I and other customers came across some guy named Edwin an associate and two others ! Me and some other guests were waiting in line to be helped. We were waiting approximately for about 25 mins and all of a sudden a police officer walks in and all the associates especially EDWIN dropped the attention from the other T-Mobile customers that were waiting  because of that gesture he had done to the rest of us! Never did I ever encounter this experience and at least an apology wasn't offered ! Just because he's an OFFICER **a customer as well because he purchased some gadget , never should he have the authority to do this to anyone ! Never coming to this location and I will make sure I will put Edwin and his other tatted associate in the customer service survey because that's just not right ! Good thing . I got everything on camera and witnesses ! And thanks to Kevin  for apologizing and helping me !! We are all nurses doctors and engineers ! We all have to wait for our chance and these associates should take the time to apologize and shouldn't be saying oh if you have any questions tell my manager! UHM NO ! CUSTOMERS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT ! And as an associate and your so called manager is busy to help , then you should take the role of the leader not the follower !< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>This was one of my worst visits to any T-Mobile store. I walked in to switch phones under a warranty. I asked them to transfer the information. They said they could not due to the original phone's battery issues and the blue tooth connection. I informed them that it would stay on if connected to power. They said it wouldn't work without trying. Then I asked if they had a transfer device, they said they didn't, but had a machine that was not working. They offered no other help, and we're not really paying attention to helping me. They were having other conversations. I left to factory reset the phone myself, cause they did not offer to do that as well. I returned again and again they were not very interested in helping me. The person that changed my phone, didn't even realize that the new phone came with it's own battery, cause he was not paying attention and carrying another conversation. This is the last time I will be at this store for anything other than a payment. I have already let friends and family know and will be making reviews in other forums. Please note that I was in the Montebello mall store location the night before, where I was only there to inquire about needing a new SIM for an upgraded phone. Not only did Jose say I didn't need it, but he took the time to open a difficult case, transfer my daughter's information to the new phone and show her how to use it. That was excellent customer service and I'll return to that site from now on.<//Text>< pictures>

Be careful. They blatantly lie to get a sale. There is also a restocking fee once you leave their store on items that you want to return- even if the product you purchased is horrible and you want to exchange it for something better.</review>

STAY AWAY from this location! Every time I have come here I have problems with the workers. For one, they're  not properly trained and don't know what they're  talking about half the time. These guys are crooks, I went to turn in my s6 because I received my s8 in the mail.  The manager was overlooking my phone before I turned it in, he started shoving a charging cable in my phone that wasn't for my phone and then proceeded to tell me my phone was not charging and I could not turn it in. I left and my phone is charging in my car but the port is definitely damaged now! ( I just transferred all my stuff to the s8 and it was fine )CAUTION!!! STAY AWAY!!< /Text>

If I could rate them less than one star I would. I have stopped by this location 4 times and honestly I have no idea why I keep trying with this location. They are rude truly dont undertsand how any of these employee even have a job. On one of the occasions I haf to ealk put because it smelled so bad it made me sick. I don't think  want establishment should ever smell like that not even a porta potty. Second time I needed to get a phone and they ignore me for a while. While other employees did nothing. Third time I was in the neighborhood and again wanted to inquire about a phone and they refuse to help order a phone which they can do. They are always too busy to help customers even if they are not doing anything.

The last straw for me at this location was trying to buy accessories for a phone and there being 4 other customers ahead in line with only one employee on the floor. Clearly that's unacceptable. Not once were any other customers acknowledged which is horrible. Speaks volumes of their customer service or lack of. Management needs to realize why this location hasnpoor reviews.< /text>

DON'T GO TO THIS LOCATION SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE.   The rep  that was working with me was alright. I had a s6 edge and I upgraded to an s7 and it feels like I paid for a downgrade. I called to see what options I had and the guy pretty much said you are an idiot, not our problem. It was the same guy I saw somebody at the store yelling at for not telling disclosing all of the information. It may have been my mistake, but way to ad insult to injury t mobile.</Text>

I completely agree with the other reviews. This has been the worst experience ever. I have never received such a poor customer service at any other T-Mobile stores. Employees are not knowledgeable and are extremely rude to the customers. I wished I would've read the reviews before coming to this store.< /Text>

Don't waste your time. Phones are out of stock, manager feels like she owns T-Mobile, and overall really bad customer service skills. This store is also not a "tmobile" store. it is a private own tmobile franchise.< /Review>

These t mobile workers don't know what they are doing and the manager is the worse! I requested to cancel an account yet I'm still getting charged for it even though I have contacted t mobile customer care. They will mislead you and tell you anything just to activate your account. This is a nightmare and I'm not even a t mobile client! Stay away from this store people!< /review>

<date>1493336832388< /date><Rating>1</Rating><Text>after reading all the complaints, it makes you wonder if Tmobile the company or the owner of the independant Tmobile store even read these complaints about their employees.  I too have had my problems with this Tmobile as well.  The staff are not trained enough if at all to deal with customers.  It seems to me that the person they hire never worked before.   Which is the case of the Tmobile located in Atlantic Square.  I stayed with Tmobile due to in my opinion a better company than the others.  So the next time I need service or other phone issues, I look for a Tmobile that is run by Tmobile and not some other independant owner.  They are not held by the same rules of conduct and customer service as a Tmobile store run by Tmobile. If you call to complain on one of these type of stores, Tmobile will come down on them and fix the problem.  They dont want a bad reputation.  So, in the future when visiting a Tmobile store look on the walls.  If the Tmobile company is owned by an independant  company or person a plaque will be posted on the wall stating that.  Or just ask there staff  who owns this store.  Lastly, as customers we pay hundreds of dollars for a phone and for its service.  These stores and their employees should at least treat the customer with a little more respect.< /Text>< pictures>

Just stop by to check if I could pre order a Note 8
Came in and right off the bat I notice it was busy so I waited patiently. After about 10 minutes more customers came in and they completely ignored me and my family. After about 20 minutes of waiting we decides to leave.
Worst customer service ever!!!!

< Review>
It used to be a good store. A employee name Robin basically stole 100 dollars from me. When I went to go pay my bill. I gave her a extra 100 to put into my account so I can purchase items on Google play using my tmo account. Left the store, waited for 2 days but the funds never came. Called tmo to se what happened. They couldn't help me because no one put MY MONEY into my account. So I went to the store directly. Robin was not there. Spoke to the clueless employees but they couldn't do anything. Tried to speak with the manager but he didn't gave a care. I like tmo's service. But this store are nothing but crooks. Plus their customer care is horrible. If there's 2 customers in front of you. Might as well bring a chair because it's gonna take forever to service you. Just so you can pay your bill. Ugh, never coming to this store again.<//Review>

Don't go there!!! If you have problems with your phone they won't help. They just tell you to call t-mobile. Seriously they are complete idiots, they have no clue what they are doing. Don't waste your time, they won't help.</Text>

<Review>Worse experience ever. One of my phones had mechanical issues they told us to call the insurance company since this is the second time that the phone has that issue called the insurance and said they couldn't place a claim,  to go back to the store and if they didnt want to resolved the issue to have them call the insurance company. Went back and the assistant manager Ashley was extremely rude. She didn't want to call the insurance company we left mad and had to wait till next day to go to a different store.< /Review><name>Maria Soto< /name></record></dataset><record>

I grabbed a Nike air max worth more than 170.00$ / Got the shoe sales man attention asked if they had a certain color he said no,I asked if I can order it there at store he said not sure maybe,walked sway after that, So yeah I'm never going back that dum kid can continue to hate his job. Clearly it shows he is unhappy.<//Text>

I bought some display shoes which I didn't really want because they had a couple stains on the back but they were the last ones in my size  . I asked if there was any chance I could get a  small discount and ill take the stain out myself .they girl said no but a nicer man at the counter said go ahead and give her a small discount . And since then I have been back multiple times and bought me and my boyfriend and kids shoes there .</Text>

So ive been there a couple times and everything has been okay. But today i went to purchase some shoes and i found some on sale that were 29.95. I went to the cashier to pay and was charged 39. I told her they were said to be on sale at 29 she checked and said "they are 33, probably they were mispriced". So the tag said 29 they were actually 33 but they charged me 39. I asked for a refund. They just want to rip you off!<//review>

< Review>
A favorite regular place to eat, always has fast kind service and consistently tasty food. The menu is very fairly priced. Thank you, Kebab Cafe for the many years of delicious food. I hope to eat your food for many years to come. Especially recommend the Falafel Burger and the Gyro. The halloumi is an tasty snack or side when you want something salty. The Turkish Coffee with cardamom will keep you alert :)<//Review>

Wonderful food! Everytime I've been here, the food has been amazing. The staff is friendly. The portion sizes are great. One gyro is enough to fill anyone up.</review>

< Review>
The staff that helped me was very friendly and made sure to answer my questions in a detailed manner. Was roughly a 20 min wait to get my food and I do have to say it was worth it. The atomic mushrooms were amazing. The gyro sandwich was amazing. My friend who accompanied me had high praise for the gyro burger. The only thing that caught me off guard were the skewers. Lamb skewer was good, however the chicken and beef skewers were kinda bland mostly tasting the same and we're not really improved by either sauces. Overall good place, would come back for more mushrooms and gyros<//Review>

<review>Always delicious food and very kind, and personalized service. I try to stop by every time I’m in the area. I’ve even taken the gyros all the way back home to SF so my husband could try them. Once I mentioned that’s what I was doing they wrapped the ingredients separately for me so nothing got soggy on the 5+ hour drive. A+</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

The gyros and fries are so addicting! They are currently offering curbside pickup during the pandemic and the customer service has been amazing as usual. They have buzzers and are sanitizing everything. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Humboldt.<//Review>

I LOVE the food at this place and have been going over 15 years, but boy what a disappointment in customer service! After ordering over $60 in entrees for our dinner, there were a few items that were missing.I called thinking no big deal, they will replace or refund me. NOPE! They did NOT offer to replace or refund what was missing. They snapped and stated "they were busy", so we have to deal with it during "these times". Did not know that THIEVING was okay during these hard times. I will be revoking my business here, very sad.< /text>

Paid over $30 for snack sized portions... DO NOT GO HERE. Not authentic, bland, and a rip-off on portions. I'm assuming all of the good reviews are people who are not familiar with this cuisine.  Will NEVER return.<//text>

Service is nice and the food is prepared in cases on display to see freshness. I like the transparency and options. The sauces were tasty and everything was hot and freshly cooked. Kebabs were perfectly grilled and falafals were not dry or too oily. I would definitely come back to try more<//text>

I love this place! Everytime I make it to the Eureka area I make it a point to go to Arcata and go to this restaurant. I've taken many people here for their first time and everyone has agreed its amazing. The Gyros are awesome and the French fries are the best around.</Text>

By FAR, the best affordable burger in Northern California - in fact, I believe they have the best burger for the price of anywhere I've ever had. Yes, the Mediterranean cuisine is great - but so is everything else they do. Really. If you are in the area and are looking for a cheap meal, you really can't go wrong here no matter what you choose from the menu.< /review>

One of my favorite places to get food in the area. Get a gyro (aka döner kebab) with tzatiki and a side of Atomic Sauce! They also sell some beers/ciders.<//text>

Best lamb kebob ever, cooked perfectly, tender with very little fat. The mushrooms were grilled well with Tzaktsi (sp?) sauce heavenly. Dolmas good as usual.
Only 4 stars given just because the chairs & table are a little uncomfortable, dimness made it hard to read the menu.
Otherwise, besides being the only Mediterranean restaurant around, definitely the best with quite reasonable prices.< /text>

Nice hole in the wall restaurant with awesome food.  You can dine in or take away.  Small place with not a lot of seating, but one can usually find a spot. Friendly staff, great service, and they are happy to explain menu items that you may be unfamiliar with.  Everything is super fresh.  Great assortment of Mediterranean dishes, falafel, kebabs, etc.  If you like spicy heat, try either if their freshly made sauces, delish.  Working our way through their menu has been a pleasure.<//text>

The place is very clean, decorative, and overall  appealing. The waiter was polite and very reliable. And the food was amazing! I ordered lamb kebabs. And there's something I'd like to point out. I once had lamb chops and nearly gagged from the fat on them. However, the fat on the lamb kebabs was really Good! Overall, this is a great place to eat.< /Text>

The Kabob cafe is absolutely fantastic.  From the beef/lamb gyro to the Lamb kabobs and the vegetables are absolutely delicious and all food fresh.  We also had the chocolate dipped baklava was fantastic.  We are from Paradise Ca. and we will be back everytime we are here in the area.

Always delicious and really great prices! The goat cheese is amazing and gyros are the best! Most of the staff are great...a few could have a quick costumer service training but overall their great! We come here every time we go through Arcata.< /Text>

Great gyro burgers. We stop here for the night and I am glad we did. I wanted something besides fast food and we found it. The meat is awesome the flavor is very good. Highly recommend it to anyone.<//Review>

Much better food for the price than any other place we've tried in the area. Fresh ingredients, well seasoned, and great donner meat. The menu also has a great variety of smaller and side dishes that allow you to get exactly what you want. Great service too.</review>< Pics>

Really enjoyed our meal here. As out of towners driving along the coast, Kebab Cafe truly hit the spot. The felafel is one of the better ones I've had (crispy, not oily, not super dense, and very well seasoned) and our table enjoyed our meals. Service is excellent and and friendly. If you're in the area and fast food just isn't your thing, grab a gyro or felafel from Kebab Cafe.<//text>

This and Nooner are the only Mediterranean food places in the county I have been to! Love the Gyros and Kofte. Service is quick and friendly, everything cooked fresh to order and you can see it all in the see through fridge display. Falafels are super yummy and I like the Tziki sauce. Been going here for years and their consistancy has kept me coming back!</review>

I used to come here all the time when I lived across the street. Just came here with my husband and the service and food were a pretty big disappointment. We came in about 10
Minutes before closing and ordered a dinner plate and some skewers. We waited for about half an hour and when they called our order I was surprised to see that it was packaged to go. A bunch of people who ordered after us got their food and finished eating by the time they called our order.  When ordering I wasn't told that they weren't taking dine in orders anymore. I told the cashier we were still finishing our beers and our order was for here. They told me they were closed and they weren't serving dine in orders anymore. The food was cold and we only got half of our order. We had to wait longer for the other half. I was really disappointed because this place used to be great.</Text>

I have always loved this place. I can't recommend the falafel burger w/cheese enough! French fries are okay, but the fried cheese is where it's at. It can take a little bit to get your food, but it's worth the wait. I usually get my order to go because there is limited seating. Try the falafel cheese burger.< /Review>

<text>I just moved in around the corner from this place and I've been there four times in a week. My go to is the chicken sandwich with Tzatziki sauce. It's got a great blend of flavor and consistency. The falafel and skewers are great too. If you're driving past Guintoli going north or south on the 101, stop here. Call in your order if you're in a hurry because there is usually a wait. The employees are also top notch.< /text><gmap_id>0x54d15a00f6e94c29:0x17fd570b2474b07< /gmap_id><Response>None<//Response>< username>

Blah.....the food is very dry, and salty.  I was here on business, and didn't know the area so it was one of the first restaurants I found.  First off, the building is super tiny with enough room to maybe fit 6 people.  There were a lot of people standing around waiting on their food.  I didn't care for it at all, and I do enjoy middle eastern cuisine.< /Review>

We're on our way from LA to Canada, and wanted something tasty and healthy after fast-food road junk had us all feeling icky. My wife found this place on Yelp, and it was near our hotel, so we gave it a go to take back to our hotel. It was VERY good. We're used to Baghdadi Mediterranean cuisine, and though this was different (Cypriot?), it was wonderful. The falafel sandwich was brilliant, and had a surprisingly little spicy kick to it. Very, very tasty. The hummus was ok, not great, not bad, but tasty enough. The prices were also just a tad, tad bit higher than we expected, but again, we really enjoyed the meal.< /Text>

This is by far the best Greek food in 100 miles, I constantly stop by on the way over 299...don't forget to get a dozen or two of the grape leaf wrapped deliciousnesses (dolma).

<review>Went for the grand reopening and all I can say is wow. Amazing staff, dancers, and waitresses. Highly recommend to anyone looking to escape reality for few hours and just enjoy life. Mask must be worn any time walking around but tables and chairs are 6 feet apart. Took my wife and as a newbie she had a great time. Thank you for the hospitality and mutual respect!!!< /review>< Pics>

<Review>So I walked in to this place tipsy and with only goal, to dance. And danced I did. I was really feeling the music that night, the DJ was mixing salsa with hip hop and he made it work. I loved the environment and the people all seem really nice out there.

The make out room is a must go, if you go bar hopping in the mission!< /Review>< Response>

This is the next HOT place! Delicious and fresh food that can change based on seasonal ingredients.

Loved the blognese, the corn cake, paella, and flat bread.

Can't believe it's all plant bases food.

Planning on going every week and try all the dishes on the menu :)</review>

The atmosphere was great but the ten dollar cover was a little steep considering it was Latin night. The place was filled with creepy, ponytail wearing middle aged men. Would maybe try this place again on any other night.<//text>

This is one of my favorite topless bars in the area. The drinks are fairly priced. I especially, enjoy their $2 beer deals. The dancers are mostly in their 20s, and a lot of them are quite pretty. They would sit down, and chat with you. Still, guys, remember they are here to make money, not to make friends. Overall, next time, when I am in the area, I will visit this establishment again!</review>

<text>I visited this evening and the experience was mediocre. They showed something terrible on tv. Next, a dancer tapped me in the head with her shoe. I walked away. A dancer accused me of insulting her. She said she was from Downtown Los Angeles. I told her I am from LA County. She didn’t know what county Downtown Los Angeles was in.

I have nothing against her based on the level of education completed. There are many successful people who have dropped out of school.</text>< time>

This place is the worst of all not the girls but management. They will  kick you out the table even if you are consuming and have a tap open... this is really not how things work.  This is what happens when you let an unprofessional run the show. Dont even think to go there. I have never ever experienced such a disgraceful and discriminated moment in my life. You dont kick your customers even if Donald Trump who need a table.. respects to be respected. Morons that's what satin management are....perhaps this a lawsuit I have been discriminated.<//review>

Great gentlemen's club! Most of the girls are pretty and young. They have good deals for beer on Tuesdays and weekends. Without these good things, the staff inside is friendly, polite, and helpful. So, I would recommend anyone to visit this establishment, but for best deals come on weekends!<//review>

<text>This organization is a nightmare!!!!  While I understand brands not allowing people into fitting rooms 1 year ago but to still not allow it is luscious.  And to make things even more exciting you can find anyone on the sales floor to help you.   Can't figure out what the big deal is abt this brand.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bfe8ebf4048f:0xcc774e1dd07c4cc7</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Take elevators from parking lot below to 6th floor. This location has women, men and kids sections. Well stocked and very well designed interiors and displays makes this store quite clean and nice. Service is nice and friendly. Sales are quite often and are very popular with younger customers.< /Text>

Walked in today 12/18/2020 to purchase some clothes and asked an employee to help me and was super rude, she refused to help me then I saw her go and talk to her manager then when I approached the manger to complaint the manager started telling me get out of her store and was telling me off in front of other customers when I wasn’t on the wrong saying she believes her employees instead of customers. I found it super disrespectful how she kicked it me out I wouldn’t recommend shopping at this Zara or maybe better management is needed. Also manager refused to give me her name as well as the employee I felt a bit profiled and that’s not right because they were only helping older women and because of my age and my ethnicity.</review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Worst costumer service from the manager! I wanted to purchase a belt they had for sale but was missing the tag and since they didn’t find the price they wouldn’t sell me the belt! Who says no to a sale?! Who is training this people to turn away business?
I suggested he called Zara corporate to get a reference number or something they can do to process the purchase and he flat out said no with an attitude. I asked why not? He said I don’t know who you want me to call? I said the corporate office since they might be able to help and again he just said no with an attitude. I’ve never seen a retail store that doesn’t want to sell merchandise!</review>< Pics>

<Text>The store is nice and well stocked but employees are don’t give a f big time. I asked manager to send second person to the register while he was walking around doing nothing. So we waited 20+ minutes to get checked out with one person at the register. They had more employees on the floor then customers at the store. Shame.</Text>< pictures>

I swear to God I give this store so many chances. I came in last week to purchase some shirts. I bought three shirts that day. When I got home I noticed that one of the shirt’s still had the sensors on it. When I got the chance I went back to get that sensor removed. On the way there I realized they double charged me for a shirt. I’m thinking since I am on my way to get the sensor removed they can also fix the double charge. I spoke to one of the employees I explained what happened. She says I have to get manager involved. Someone comes up, I explain my situation again and he said that he has to call another manager over. (which I thought he was a manager)
I explain my situation a third time. He pretty much accuses me of stealing that shirt and that there is no proof I purchased this shirt. Also he will not be removing the sensor off the shirt. I was livid. So not only did they steal from me twice, I can’t even use one of the shirts. Now I have to deal with a third party call center to fix this. When it was the employees fault.
Also why didn’t the alarm go off when I was walking out of the store originally and today when I left with the shirt. Clearly their security system sucks. I honestly think it has to do with racism(I’m a Hispanic man) but obviously I can’t prove that. Never been this upset. I just want to use the shirt lol
All other employees were nice except the last manager who walked away when I was talking to him. I guess unless you’re a white millionaire here at Beverly Hills they won’t help you.<//Review>

If I could give 0 stars - I would.
Sadly, Zara Managers (shout to to Javier from Men’s Department who was assisting me that specific time) have power trips due to their insecurities and they are happy to say no without even having to listen to the other side or seek to understand what’s going on before making a decision. Would have been justified if it was busy but there was total of 30 people at the store lol
The saddest part is that none of this feedback will improve the operations of the business or customer service - Zara is fast fashion, so the term “customer service” is non-existent there, so please be careful and inspect the merchandise you’re purchasing thoroughly before you hand it to cashier. You are your own witness of what you are purchasing and the condition it is in... The cashiers are just taking off the sensors and putting the items into bags...poorly<//Review>

Lazy customer service reps, I waited in line 15 minutes and they saw me wait, and then I was told by the asian guy with bleach blonde hair that i need to go to childrens department to pick up my order never mind that no one was at either of the other two counters including the children's dept. The week before i picked up a similar item at the same counter without a problem and the guy just called it over the radio. Not going back here again and that guy should be fired for being so lazy and inconsiderate. Nor does Zara's email specify what counter or department to use.</Review>

Zara has some of the most incomprehensibly moronic & customer-unfriendly policies I've ever encountered.  If you call & determine they have an item in stock, they will refuse to set it aside for you to come & buy - even if you give them a credit card number so they can literally process the purchase in advance.  Their solution: just drive there & hope it's still available when you arrive.  As in...they literally can't bother to spend 30 seconds pulling it off the rack, instead insisting that you to burn gas, pollute the environment, waste time, put miles on your car, & contribute to unnecessary city traffic - for the *chance* that you arrive & it might still be available.  I can conceive of literally no downside for them to holding a guaranteed, pre-paid item.  Thanks but no thanks - I'm not going to drive across the city to "maybe" buy something when you could spend a simple 30 seconds to ensure that the trip wouldn't be in vain.< /review>

I had 1 item to return and was waiting in line for 15 minute, when I was told that there is only one person who can do returns and she was helping a couple with literally 100 items. I asked for help, the manager came and said nothing until I approached him and asked for help; he told me that there is nothing he would do and was supper rude. The worst customer service ever. He didn’t have a tag, unfortunately I don’t know his name; but that’s not how you treat your customers, you should try to help them, not say you are not gonna help (he actually said it)
Long story short, after waiting 30 minutes, the other cashier who was doing nothing decided to take returns from people in (by that time) huge line. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Never expected that from Zara, especially the one in Beverly Center.< /text>

<review>Honestly it’s a nice store but it’s the worst customer service you’ll ever get. Literally only one person at each counter even when there’s 5 people in line. No consideration for customers time or acknowledgement of customer. Just a bad store.< /review><rating>1</rating>< Gmap_id>

Was looking for a certain item, called the store and they confirmed they had it. When I came in 15 mins later and asked an associate to help me find it, she couldn’t enter the item’s code properly and was rolling her eyes at me and at the end told me to wait, which I did, but she WASN’T EVEN GOING TO HELP ME WITH ANYTHING. I asked another associate and turned out they didn’t have the item in stock. Rude, unprofessional and a waist of time.</review>

<Text>It’s unfortunate that Zara  don’t do any hold for customers in the end you end up loosing  a customer and lost a sale !!!!! also they don’t offer customer service at all and they have about 6 or more registers but never open they rather have one person at register with a big line people end  up walking away like I did< /Text><pics>None< /pics><time>1563775560017< /time></record></dataset><record>

<Text>To address the 1-star review; the customer service is fantastic. The portions are quite large. They fill the box quite tightly, but always put in large portions of the entrees. They do pat down the food, so more can fit. Even a VERY hungry eater would be more than satisfied. This is my favorite chinese spot in the area<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp><time>1536436575778< /time><userid>110586131600272206601</userid><GmapID>0x80dd2b515eb47b59:0x692052a4c69f464a<//GmapID><Pics>None</Pics>< name>

Taste is on point and the quality is great for a fast food Chinese spot. Lady was generous with the portions and friendly. Will be coming back for sure!  Prices are excellent for the amount of food you get. 10x better than Panda.

Don't leave without trying the spicy orange chicken.< /Review>

Great food, Fantastic customer service! I love coming here after a long day, simply because of how nice the head cashier and server is. And it's good comfort food if you like Chinese . Large portions at good prices as well.<//text>

<Review>This is under new ownership, i looked in the kitchen, its really clean. So i decided to try, my favorite is orange chicken, chow main, white rice. Tastes fresh, so i check it out once a week. Come hungry, the foam is packed. They now offer delivery, I believe this location has the best price around. I cruise by late, they are always open when i stop by around 10pm</Review><userid>105404221108443694738< /userid>< name>

The best Chinese food in La Mirada and the surrounding area. Great customer service and the restaurant is super clean. The food is fresh, and there always cooking in the back. Just wish they still did deliveries!! l would chose them for dinner even more often, if l didn't have to go get it, because l'm super lazy!!

Try the food.  Very bad.  The fried rice old and hard.  The chicken was old and sour.. might get food poisoning.  After along day running around town had to feed my family.   Called and told wokstar.  They did not seem to care about good service.  I think the food was expired.</Review>

< review>
After years of driving past I finally tried this place. It is prominently located on the end of a strip mall and see it every time I drive by.

So we go in and it is very spacious and well lit, there are no customers to be found. One lady, possibly the owner behind the counter. Selections were limited very basic Chinese food and didn't look the freshest. But I was in the mood for some Chinese so we tried it anyway.

The food was acceptable at best. We have been to other HKE locations and the food was much worse quality and quantity than the others.

I normally would give it a 3 star rating, but about 2 weeks after this visit I wanted Chinese again, and rather than driving to Cypress for our favourite HKE experience at 8:30 in the evening we just went up the street to the local La Mirada HKE. When we got there we were shocked, they were closed, the hours sign on the door said they should be open til 9, but the were closed... not just closed, but gone closed, everything cleaned up, lights off, doors locked, nobody home closed. Closed and gone at 8:35ish when they are supposed to be open til 9.

Sorry LM HKE... we will not be back. We drove to the Cypress HKE, got there a little after 9 and they were still open (also list 9 as closing time) selling off the remaining food. Which to me makes sense, why throw everything away when there are people who will buy it? Besides how hard it is to "stay open" while you are cleaning the kitchen and sell off the remaining food.< /review>

Thanks to our rep Jared R. He answered all the questions and if he didn't know he got the information/answer. He was also available from start to finish. It was great to have such an enthusiastic rep that guided and followed thru to completion. Great doing business with you.</Text>

Excellent experience with California Renewable Energy.  Blake was our representative and was very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable at all steps of the process.  We signed up for a Power Purchase Agreement and he got us a great low rate for electricity.  Looking forward to start saving money at no cost to us.  Solar panels are installed and look great.  We're just waiting for PG&E to wrap things up and we'll be in business.</Review>

Justin Jones of California Renewable Energy was walking my neighborhood and asking folks about their PG&E bill. At first I really didn't have time for a sales pitch but he actually made SENSE!  He looked at our electricity bill and compared that to the cost of owning a solar system and again passing up his offer would have been disastrous when it comes to paying for the electricity we use.  FYI why pay for power that being produced in Utah with a high markup when you can get it right from your roof that really boils down to owning the cow instead of buying the milk, I know no brainer.   He really went to bat for our household and found a reputable company to do the work.  PG&E's time of usage rates are rising and Justin of California Renewable Energy has got the cure.  I highly recommend that you give them a call and if that's not enough just wait until he tells you about a whopping $26,000.00 you can get back in your pocket.  That offers is soon to expire so give them a call right away and you can thank me later.< /text>

I waited a while to post this review so I could write on the my full experience. First off, I am always skeptical of door-to-door sales but after talking with the gentleman I was quickly put at ease with his knowledge, passion and professionalism. Gavin fully explained the process and answered all of my 500 or so questions. We love the idea of helping the environment and saving some money at the same time. The entire process was easy, and every associate was beyond professional. Great job.< /text>

<Text>I rarely post reviews! I eventually decided this was not the right time for me to get Solar Panels at this home (selling house soon), but I had the honor and pleasure of working with Johnny Smithwick. Johnny was incredibly professional and extremely easy to work with! He was always transparent and willing to help with anything whether it was staying in touch and answering every single one of my questions in an efficient manner to going over various providers and comparing the pros and cons of each of them. His patience and professionalism is second to none! I will keep Johnny's number in my solar panel emergency contacts to give him a call whenever it is my time for solar panels. Thanks a ton for everything Johnny! Looking forward to working with you in the future!< /Text>< user_id>

Impressed with the total process. Not your typical sales representative. Jasper was OUTSTANDING with his customer service skills and friendly non pushy personality. He walked us through every step altho I was skeptical due to all of  the horror stories from other people who used other companies I'd heard. The power point presentation put it in plain sight as to your saving as far as your bill. He continued to check up to see how the process  was going even after final installation. To top it off there are rebates and even the loan company recently contacted us regarding an additional savings. So far to good.</Text>

With all the door-to-door solar people coming to our door, we were very hesitant with California Renewable energy when they told us they could lower our power bill from taking a look at the state subsidized programs. I’m so glad we decided to do business with them! Trustworthy, reliable, and they really know their stuff! We had a great experience with them and definitely recommend this company to anyone looking to save some money on electricity or become more eco-friendly.</review>

<review>We were referred to the group through close friends that used these guys a little over a year ago. They did a lot of research and said these guys were the best. They told us they even got a check back last year from the extra power the system made. It sounded good so we decided to give it a shot. We had a great experience. It took around 3 weeks to get the solar installed. The install went great. We were impressed with the installers. We loved our consultant, he wasn't pushy and did a good job informing us. We would recommend this group and if we ever move we will use them again.<//review>< pics>

<text>We had our installed towards the beginning of this year. We are very happy with our decision. Our solar system is making more energy than we are using. It's looking like we are going to get a nice check from Edison at the end of this year. It is nice not having a bill anymore with them.
The technicians that installed our system did a great job. They took extra time and painted our electrical stuff the same color as the roof. They were nice guys. We are glad we took advantage of all the financial assistance that's available right now for solar.</text></record>

<text>I worked with a young man named Andy. I was a little suspicious when I first talked with him but once I sat down and he explained everything to me it all made sense. I'm saving close to $75 a month on my electricity bill. May not seem like a lot but Im on a fixed income so every dollar helps.< /text><user>101076675765528281692< /user>< gmap_id>

<Review>We wanted to wait a couple months before giving our review. The solar has been as promised and we are saving money. They recommended a bigger than normal system and we are making more energy than we are using because of that. It's working as planned. We are glad we went with their recommendation on going with extra panels and more power. Our friends have solar and they get a bill every year and we were nervous about that. We are making lots of extra power every month and are on track to get a check from Edison. We appreciate California Renewable Energy in taking the time to understand how much power we use and giving us extra panels. We are happy with our decision.<//Review>< Pictures>

These guys are awesome! We have had soooooo many solar guys come to our door over the years. This group is different. Within 2 minutes of sitting down with them we could tell that we could trust them and they were going to take care of us. We would recommend anyone thinking about solar to check them out. They gave us a bigger system to be safe, and our bill is lower. Good warranties. Most of all, we trusted them and they were professional.</Text>

We have been hesitant about going solar for a while. We are glad they knocked on our door. We got a new roof built into our solar project which was a huge win. They did a great job on the new roof and the solar installation. We got some amazing credits too! Great experience and we recommend this company.</Text>

These guys came to my door and told me I could save money with the new meter that was put on the house about a year ago. We decided to see how much we could save. We were surprised at how much we could save through some subsidized programs they had. We had checked out a couple of solar companies in the past and these guys had the best program. They did a good job educating us on everything. Overall we had a good experience and are going to have them meet with our mother in law too.< /text>

<Review>We decided on California Renewable Energy because they seemed like the most genuine company that we looked into. We got the feeling like they were thinking about our best interest vs their own. They also took the time and really educated us on solar and the difference between a power agreement vs buying the system. That helped us choose the right finance option for us. We ended up going with the power agreement and it has been great. We have had our system installed now for about 5 months.< /Review>< name>

<Review>I chose California Renewable Energy because they came back with the best quote. We got a couple quotes and they were the best out of three.  I did some research on the equipment they used and it was quality. We felt like we got a good deal with it being the most affordable while using good products.

We didn't know what to expect when someone knocked on our door. We were currently looking at going solar so we had Brandon see what he could do. Brandon was very professional and helped us understand the pros and cons of every option. They ended up having better options than we got from some of our friends who work in the solar industry. We spent a lot of time doing research and these guys had the best options by far. Great job Brandon and the California Renewable Energy team!</review>

< review>
We were nervous to go solar because we have heard mixed things about solar. We didn’t want two different bills. They recommended a bigger system to be safe and it has worked out well. Our system has been installed for four months and everything has been great so far. We have saved money every month and it has turned out to be a good decision. We recommend solar with this company and also recommend going with a little bigger solar system if you are feeling nervous about having two bills.</review>

We were open to anything that would save us money on our power bill. They presented some different options with solar. We did some other research and they had the best options for solar. We appreciated the time and education to help us understand everything.< /Review>

We had a great experience with California Renewal Energy! David was very thorough in explaining all of our options and broke it down so it was easy to make a decision. I always thought Solar was too expensive but now I’m kicking myself for not doing it sooner. I would recommend this company to any of my friends!</Review>

< Review>
Kyden was great at explaining the different programs that were available in my area. We ended up going with Solar and Kyden was able to get us different credits toward our solar so is costing us less money! He’s been checking in with us every few days to make sure the process is going as planned! Our solar isn’t installed yet, but once we have it for a few months I’ll definitely be back to share my experience!  My husband and I are definitely excited about finally going solar. 😊</Review>

These guys are awesome! Dave was a pleasure to work with and he answered all of my questions and also helped me understand the different ways to go solar. We looked at a lease and a loan option and for us the lease made a lot more sense since we have a lot of home improvement projects and weren’t in a position to take out a loan. The installation was quick took a half day and 2 months later it was turned on. We are saving around $87 a month our first year. I was definitely skeptical at first but for us it was a no brainer. I’ll be referring California Renewable Energy to my friends and family for sure. Thanks guys!< /Text>

We had our system installed in September of 2018. We wanted to wait a couple of months before leaving a review. Everything has been as promised. We haven't had a bill yet from the power company and our new energy payment is a lot lower than it was before working with this group.< /Text>

Store was organized and empty, save for one other person. Associate in the store was not wearing a mask. Credit card transactions require a signature, so bring your own pen or sanitizing spray.< /review>

Chicken flavor on point. A bit pricey for portion sizes. Still a must try. Oh so crispy and spicy, their mashed still the best ! Still a tasty lunch for about $ 20 bucks for two.<//Review>

<text>Took a client through the drive-thru who wanted to go there. I just got a soda. I've eaten at Popeye's before I like their chicken the breading is a little bit too thick imo but the meat is good and red beans and rice is a great dish. Also like the use of cayenne, my favorite spice and the most useful of medicinal herbs. I see they have a flounder sandwich now.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<text>This location is on point hiding from me... I never knew this one existed. It was yet another Popeyes that the "new" (now famous) chicken sandwich built. Congrats to my hometown Popeyes made big nationwide.</text>< Rate>

DO NOT go to this location. Never once do they ever get my order right. And this last and final time, they asked me to pull around to the front, where I waited. I watched the 8 cars behind me drive off with their food, and all I had gotten was a 5 piece tender. I went in after 20 minutes and turned out they had forgot about me. Quick to take my money but not quick to get my order. Manager said they were short on cooks as an excuse, but that's obviously not the case when everyone else is getting their orders. This location is a complete joke.< /review>

This one is tough to review because the food that we ordered that was in stock was delicious.  The problem was they were out of 3 of the items I attempted to order, spicy chicken strips, beignets, & ranch dipping sauce.  No silverware was provided for the side order either, we had to go back in to ask for that.</text>

First time trying their chicken. It was DELICIOUS. Although the shrimps I did not like either they weren't seasoned well or cooked well. I got stomach ache after eating them. But the chicken is the best.<//text>

<Review>Sorry the sandwich was not cooked thoroughly. The chicken was raw in middle. Sandwich did not taste good. I love popeyes and I always get my same combo At every location I visit. I'm giving 4 stars as I'm sure it's a honest mistake. But can not give five for that reason here.< /Review><resp>None<//resp></record>

Popeyes it’s one of my favorite chicken places!! I like this location a little bit better than the one in state college because it has a drive-thru. HOWEVER, I STILL MISS THE $5.00 box combo they used to have.</review>

<Review>I saw an employee walk behind the counter without a mask and proceed to serve him self with some lemonade with an already used cup, from which he was drinking from. (He was on break)
During this pandemic,  this is totally unsafe. People are asymptomatic. It is really irresponsible not having protocols at this restaurant chain. There was a manager present,  who probably saw this..   but said nothing. Plus the cashier was rude... she literally threw forks on the counter top,  while i had my hand extended to grab them... They were 2 other customers in the restaurant that saw this. we all looked at etchother.<//Review>< user_name>

< review>
Food tasted and smelled funny, first they gave me the Cole slaw without a fork, then for some reason their fountain drink was not working so they only had lemonade and a nasty "sweet" tea that tasted horrible, like they just add a bunch or sugar to the hot tea, now I have some stomachache and I can know were I got it from, honestly I wanted to give it a tried to Popeyes again but now definitely is out of the list for sure.</review>

<Text>The new spicy chicken sandwich was soo frickin' amazingly delicious..down side was that no one could go inside because of the Wuhan shutdown and only the drive thru was available..not to mention it was also around lunch time so the wait was obnoxiously long..like 40-50 minutes.  No joke!  I was hungry too so maybe that played a factor but I want one or two more.  The fries weren't great..kinda soggy..they gotta do better on those..step it up Popeyes!<//Text>< Pictures>

Not only did I have to wait 15 min for chicken that should already be prepared. They were completely out of soda and they had no syrups for them in the back. Your choices were Hawaiian Punch, Diet Coke, sweet tea. No sign up letting you know this before hand and the night before I came here and they were completely out of bone in chicken.< /Review>

Worst customer service ever. I will never buy from popeyes again because of this store. They got my honey chiken order wrong and after i came back they just put honey sauces.  $3 difference in price just for sauce. Then the frozen lemonade tasted like rust. Its the taste you get when the frozen mix is not fresh. They must have saved it from the ni before or they never clean the machine daily like they suppse to do. They never answer the phone so i had to drive back to complain.</text>

Chicken is always delicious and crispy. Biscuits are nice buttery and fluffy. The chicken sandwich is really good but not as good as many whom have fought for one lol.</Text>

<user_name>J P<//user_name><Time>1592626196996</Time><Rate>2< /Rate><text>Waited in the drive-thru for 30 minutes (the line was to the street). Upon arriving to order, I was told they didn't have any chicken but spicy. My kid won't eat spicy so this wasn't going to work. I asked how long for regular chicken but was told they had none. When I got to the window, I explained that I had waited 30 minutes and when I finally made it to the speaker, the cars were still lined up to the street so they would be waiting 30 minutes too. I asked that the manager go outside and inform those in line of the chicken situation. These things happen, but the only way to deal with them appropriately is to keep your customers informed so they don't waste their time like I did. The cashier didn't care. I've been a manager at a chicken place. This isn't how you treat your customers when facing this kind of situation. I waited in front of the restaurant for 5 minutes to see if the manager would fo the right thing and inform their customers. They didn't. Terrible, horrible way to conduct business. Have the guts to give bad news up front. That I would have respected. Won't be going back.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>To be fair I'll say that I'm not a big fried chicken eater. I tried the chicken tenders and they weren't bad. In fact, I believe that with the right dipping sauce they could be very good. I tried the Bold BBQ and the Buffalo sauces. They weren't bad, but I tired of the  Buffalo sauce rather quickly and the BBQ, though tasty, wasn't satisfying enough to make the whole dish an inspired item for me. I also tried the side dishes, red beans and rice (good stuff), as well as the jambalaya (not bad for fast food).</Review><rate>3< /rate></record></dataset><record>

Got home and  found my order missing the tender strips and the popcorn shrimps are just  the crumbled of their leftovers. They have enough staffs to not make these kinds of mistakes.

Food was solid popeyes and staff was friendly. Should be 4 stars. They lost a star for not having my catering order ready making tardy to an event I was going to. But hey, they gave me a free soda while I waited so I got that going for me.<//Text>

I went inside to ask for my money back since we were in a rush the Manager apologetic which was nice, but this location lacks speed. They need to hire hire hire especially since they are a busy location!! Where is the district manager of this location or operator of the franchise? You guy's should be helping this location out.< /review>< pictures>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Just left this location and honestly the girl working the drive thru was EXTREMELY rude. She was probably mad that bun on her head was too tight and was causing a headache. Anyways she was very impatient and short while my father was trying to talk to her asking if we could make separate orders. After initially saying they'd make the exception for us, she backtracked (with her voice raised) and said they would not be able to do it (???). When my dad asked for a knife she handed him a bag and when he asked again for a knife she said "we don't have those here" and walked away. Rude for no reason smh.

Incase she forgot we're in the middle of a pandemic so we have to wear face masks. If you can't hear what a customer is saying then you still need to be professional when asking them to repeat themselves. I worked in fast food and I had never, no matter how frustrated, talked to a customer or dismissed them like she did. I will drive the extra 10 miles to a different location next time. They need to put their staff through better training and the managers also need to be held accountable because how are you going to have someone with a stank attitude work upfront?<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Whatever is on their menu, they will have something out of stock every time I go there, either chicken tenders or coleslaw or mashed potato or something. One day you won't get honey mustard the other day you won't get ranch. I keep heading there because it is close to where I live. I have no idea how this outlet is surviving.</Text>< Pictures>

The food is great, the wait is not. Ordered and 8-piece chicken meal and a sandwich combo. It took 30 mins from the time I placed my order to the time I received it. This location is SLOW.</Text>

I found a hair in my chicken... A long black hair that definitely didn’t belong to me. I tried ordering the new sandwich that Popeye’s was raving about all over twitter since they said it was available nationally, but they said they apparently don’t have them at this location yet... that’s fine I’ll just order something else. The order was wrong since I ordered chicken tenders but got thighs and legs. I went home because I didn’t want to go back and correct them, and that’s when I found the hair. I once went there and they said they were out of chicken. How do you run out of chicken when it’s practically the number one thing you sell? I’ve given this place so many opportunities to get better and hoped that they were just having bad days, but this is consistently poor service. This place is poorly managed. It shouldn’t be that terrible considering it’s a relatively new location. I’m definitely going elsewhere for food.</review>

I dare anyone to go and say that they actually have all items on the menu available.   It hasn't occurred since they opened.  I thought perhaps because I go after 8 pm.  So I went yesterday at 11:30 am.  Same thing.  Very frustrating.<//Text>

<rate>1</rate><Review>First time visit today, 3/4/20. Went through drive-thru. Very impatient person at the window. I made him aware it was my first time and was not familiar with the menu. Placed my order. Arrived to my destination five minutes later. No receipt, no fork for coleslaw, no napkins, food is stone cold. Got the store phone number, called. Disconnected, no other number available. Nonetheless, I am disappointed AND will eat cold food...no napkins, no fork!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dd297e6bb57c37:0x375e047c907062cc<//gmapID></record>

This place is great but the line is way out of control to the point where I cannot give it five stars. People block the exit, they don't want to clear a path thinking you're going to cut, and they really need to think about getting security to manage traffic</text>

I have gone for the last 2 weeks on 3 different occasions around 9:00pm-9:15pm and they never have chicken tenders available they only have bone in chicken. I am done going to this location and will go elsewhere from now on. I asked the person in the drive thru when they stop selling chicken tenders and they said whenever they run out. I asked since they close at 10pm why would they not have chicken to sell other than bone in chicken?? Person was like yeah that's  just the way it is. Just ridiculous!< /Text>

Chicken sandwich is super overrated! Best part about it. It a big piece. Young man working register seemed very unhappy to be working. Felt like he was super annoyed when taking my order. Told him have a good day. He just looked at me like F U. Had to cleN my table because it was a mess. Trash was also overflowing.</review>

<text>First, Great tasting chicken

Second,  horrible service.  They constantly run out of chicken, the staff is really rude and the eating area is dirty, trash cans are always full. The drink station has a dirty wet towel smell and no one has even considered cleaning the place. The Bathroom are so bad, You are better off using a gas station bathroom.

There is no manager to talk with and if you get anyone that can hold a conversation,  they could care less.

Very, very, very poor customer service<//text><resp>None</resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

It’s a disaster in the drive thru they take about 20 minutes for each car to get their order at the drive thru window. This place is either way under staffed or the ppl that work here need to turn it up a notch. This place will keep u In  The drive thru forever!!! Please do something about this. Thank u<//text>

Simply no manager, no chickens, bunch of cusomers are waiting already, I've tried this place about 5~6 times. I never left this place without issue.
Beware, you are so lucky if you leave any issue.
Service: they don't know what they doing
Food quality: not stable (sometimes you see the blood from the joint)</Review>

I do love some spicy chicken. I love Popeyes extra spicy thighs. Not too thrilled with their french fries. Wish they had a regular french fry option. I do like their mac and cheese better because it's thicker version then KFC. I also love to get the chicken strip tenders and get their barbecue sauce which is also spicy and dunk away! So spicy and delicious I love it.</review>

<Text>I love Popeye's and have been craving it. So I picked it up on my way home tonight. I was sad when they were out of butter for my biscuit but even sadder when I got home opened my side and saw it only half full of slaw. Is that normal or am I remembering wrong? I thought it should be at least mostly full.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Popeyes just isn't the same, they're frequently running out of chickenI don't know if it's the franchise owners are the actual company but Popeye's shouldn't ever run out of chicken especially the sandwiches and or side orders.
The parking lot is pretty big very accessible and they have a drive thru. It's a very clean place inside and it's a good place to sit down and eat.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

I'd  give it 0 if I could. They always run out of chicken. So you can't order literally anything. The sides seem to also run out fairly early, always double check your order 9/10 times your sides will be wrong,  they wont tell you, and just give you whatever they want. Most of the staff is unprofessional and unhelpful. I am thankful for one young lady who went out of her way to help me fix my order, while the rest were in the drive thru huddled, talking with their friends.<//review>

Well it took forever to get through the drive thru line and when we got home with our meals the green beans were only half full in the container. One of the drinks was only partially filled and the pieces of chicken in both the meals were not correct. One had a breast, wing and 2 legs the other had a breast, thigh and 2 legs. This Popeyes location has a bad rap of being slow and screwing up orders. Wish there was a better one close.<//Review>

<Review>Popeyes just isn't the same, they're frequently running out of chickenI don't know if it's the franchise owners are the actual company but Popeye's shouldn't ever run out of chicken especially the sandwiches and or side orders.
The parking lot is pretty big very accessible and they have a drive thru. It's a very clean place inside and it's a good place to sit down and eat.</Review>< pics>

<Text>Went into the restaurant, Ordered mild chicken nuggets and 2 thighs to go. Specifically asked for my order to be fresh. Told them I don't mind waiting. The employee told me they just made some fresh ones. Got my order, came home, they gave me a thigh and a leg instead of two thighs plus my nuggets were barely warm, not hot or fresh whatsoever. Later that day called the restaurant, explained the situation. Talked to Issac the manager who not only acted very professional and friendly, but also helped me resolve the situation. Very impressed. Awesome job, hope all restaurants have a manager like Issac who go above and beyond for their customers.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd297e6bb57c37:0x375e047c907062cc<//Gmap_id></record>

Not only did they run out of half of the menu two hours before closing, but the employees are smoking pot right outside of the store. They obviously don’t care about customer service. They didn’t even respond over the intercom when we were trying to order after finding out everything we wanted wasn’t available.<//Review>

Really good... Nice people.  l always get dark meat but the legs are so small I just ask for 2 thighs now.  I think it's expensive so I don't go very often.  For $3 more you can get an entire meal including soup,  salad,  and dessert at Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant.<//text>

For Pete's sake that was really annoying. Greasy hands calls for napkins or something to wipe your hands on. I've ordered here plenty of times. Food is always good but they never give you napkins...geez Oh yeah don't try to call them ever because they never answer I guess they are too busy  forgetting to put napkins in the bag to answer the phone.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Service was crazy slow. The manager was taking orders with absolutly zero amount of a rush or urgency to take care of the long line (line out the door) of customers. 1st they forgot an important part of my order so I had to wait for them to get the second half ready and the chicken was in no way anything I would call "fresh", but i was already home so we choked it down. Will not return to this Popeys.< /Review><resp>None< /resp><UserId.>117476671168151895669</UserId.></record>

If the menu item saris 12 strips or chicken for the same price, you should be able to get 6 pieces of chicken and 6 strips, but the said is against policy. Stupid policy.. It's the same price! They also skimp on the sauces and put sweet relish in the coleslaw, yuck.< /Review>

Had a small issue with our food and wanted to come back and give them 5 stars. Specifically for the actions and problem solving of a manager named Isaac, give this guy a raise. When faced with an issue that his coworkers did not make the order to a type that I asked for. He reassured me that there will be some training going on in the future so that it doesn't happen again. Very professional, great manager, amazing problem solver and communicator.</review>

<Review>Was my family's favorite place to eat fried chicken! Who knew asking for ketchup/sauces to go along with 12 piece family combo required dirty looks from the store manager and I'm sure the worker got yelled at for doing his job. Yeah no thanks we meant it we weren't coming back to eat. You didn't need to stare into my car and give my family dirty looks. You sir suck as a manager.< /Review>< Pictures>

Popeye's foods have great flavor, but it lacks variety. I was visiting often went they had the smoked chicken, but it was for a limited time.

I'm giving Popeyes 3 stars because of all its meat is mostly chicken and they are breaded. My nutritionist recommends avoiding all breaded meats.

I hope Popeye’s introduce new items to its menu and upgrades the one available.</Text>

<Review>Service was crazy slow. The manager was taking orders with absolutly zero amount of a rush or urgency to take care of the long line (line out the door) of customers. 1st they forgot an important part of my order so I had to wait for them to get the second half ready and the chicken was in no way anything I would call "fresh", but i was already home so we choked it down. Will not return to this Popeys.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>I went through drive thru waited a little bit finally they took my  order. I ordered 12 piece family family pack. Got to window waited 5 minutes to receive order. Can someone tell me why they don't automatically put napkins in the bag. For Pete's sake that was really annoying. Greasy hands calls for napkins or something to wipe your hands on. I've ordered here plenty of times. Food is always good but they never give you napkins...geez Oh yeah don't try to call them ever because they never answer I guess they are too busy  forgetting to put napkins in the bag to answer the phone.<//Review><user_name>Demitri Cain< /user_name><rating>2</rating></record>

<Text>I will give 2 stars for the food. The service sucks everytime I go. I have been maybe 6 times for the food. The restaurant is always out of random things like ketchup and Coke. Today was my limit. 2 cars in front of me. 20 minute wait to get my food. I ordered very simple. 4 mild tenders. 1 large fry. 1 kids meal. My wait at the window after a 10 minute wait was another10 minutes. I was given the wrong total almost 2 times my meal cost. I questioned. The kid was confused. Then he gives me an amount less than what it was when I ordered. I questioned again and apparently now the kids meal was not on my order. Anyway.. the food is decent but this particular store really needs some change.< /Text>< pics>

Popeyes chicken was good, just a problem with the orderung of the pumkin / cheese pie. Had to drive back and go in the stire vecause we got apple instead of thw pumkin pie twice . It turns out they all look the same no difference in packaging or anything. Still did not get out pumkin cheese pie. Which was the only reason for ordering pie in the first place.<//review>

<text>This establishment is horrible. No customer service whatsoever. The place is ran by Teens, literally. Seen the guy walk into the restroom and back out with his phone on hand back into the kitchen. No attention to orders as they are usually wrong. Very slow service. Been there a few times and twice went about 40min before close and they will deny you service even tho their "business" hours are until 10pm. They start cleaning up an hour before closing at 10pm so do not show up wasting your time within the last hour.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>Here's the rundown: location, environment, service, and food.

The new Popeyes' on those street has been a haven for everyone that loves the chickens because the location has become convenient. The design is very modern, it looks fresh to the eyes with the popping colors. The service is quick and easy: the cashiers and the general staff are friendly and approachable; and they complete your business very well.

The food is plain lovable; there's always room to try the new things they serve, because there's hardly space for disappointment!<//Text><user_name>H. Aubrey Almonte<//user_name>< GmapID>

I guess I went during the chicken sandwich craze. They didn't have anything left... Biscuits with no honey. Tenders with no dipping sauce. And didn't even find out that the tenders were mild (ordered spicey) until I got back to the hotel.<//review>

The chicken was great I ordered a couple of the Tuesday specials and I can get four pieces of chicken and get out of there for under $5 yep well you can't do that if you go half mile up the road for a half mile down the road and eat at the kernelstheir chickens good but the pieces are not as big and the prices are astronomical compared to the two piece special on Tuesdays at Popeye's Chicken so I really enjoy going there at least once a week maybe three times a month<//Text>

And right when they opened and I asked for it they said it will be a 1 hour wait because they forgot to prepare them. Then laughed and said sorry in very sarcastic and demeaning way.

<review>Secret to ordering.
Their spicy chicken and the creole gravy taste kinda sooty. Get the mild & order a breast ala carte, add on mashed potatoes - no gravy. That is a 4 star meal but I'm giving only 3 because the set menu is what most people order and that choice isnt very good.</review></record>

Whether it's sauces or literally every side except fries and coleslaw, or a bunch of sodas are out of syrup. It's hard to actually go in and get what you want.

<review>Can be hit or miss on freshness, prices are higher than other locations in the area, they don't accept most of their own coupons as this franchise location does not participate, and they don't keep advertised specials very long, ie, to major tv ads ran two weeks only here, and prices went back up fast. Go to the location on Beach or the one on Katella. 2nd visit the dining area is trashed and dirty.</review>< pictures>

<review>Ordered a 6 piece spicy chicken tenders and all tenders were so hard like they been sitting out for a while, I ordered through drive thru and live 10min drive away, so I noticed as I got home. Didn't bother to go back since I was hungry, but at least I tried the place and hopefully if I ever go back, I'm given Hot fresh tenders.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Review>I normally love Popeyes and I know this facility has cheaper prices than another location nearby but the service was slow for a drive thru and that is because they sent the Drive Thru cashier out twice to the parking lot with orders. I think someone else in the store should run orders if they are behind rather than making more cust wait for her to return from outside<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

If u ain't come to THIS Popeye's are you even looking for good chicken? My bro Tony always offers service with a smile and greasy fingers. Honestly I come here like twice a week, got me all broke but it's worth it.

Very nice our helper got all order right , no problems at all . The chicken was hot but our Frye's was not hot hate when they do then in advance they should always make them at order . We where ask if we need it souse that is good not everywhere they ask and hate coming home and did not got ketchup etc .... We always assume they add it with out asking like daaaa I order frys I expect ketchup if I order chicken nuggets I expect BBQ souse or some kind but yeah . I recommend chiken was hot and goooooood , the potatoes where good too as well as the rise and beans.</Review>

<Review>I am very disappointed in the portion of food I received today. I paid $9.69 for a 2 piece platter that comes with a drink. I received the smallest drumstick it looks like it came off a pigeon! Then they put a wing in there. Uh typical two piece at KFC or Jolliebee is leg and thigh. The biscuit was way small as well as the sides which were not even half way full. If this is the serving size fine then charge 5$Bucks! But to pay $9.69 for hot wing size portion? No thanks. Guess I'll just have to give my business to company that values my hard earned dollar. I included my pics vs their advertisement.< /Review>< pictures>

There spicy chicken is delicious! Their sweet tea is on point. I haven't tried all the sides but the Mac & cheese, mashed potatoes & gravy are tasty. The drive thru at this location is wacky. They should have wrapped it around the parking lot instead of running it through the middle. When it gets busy the drive thru blocks the parked cars from getting out. Customer service has been good so far.<//text>

Brand new place!  So, it's really clean.  It's in a small shopping center, but, the parking lot is ok.   The spicy chicken is the best!< /Review>

This is a new establishment and on my very first order for the office they really dropped the ball. Once we spoke with management they replaced the whole order with no problem. That's a big plus in my book.<//Review>

I asked them about the special that they advertised on TV and told me it was not available. Then to come to find out it was available. So instead of spending $8 for two meals I walked away spending $21 for two meals.< /review>

I ordered 4 PCS compo and I found a quill in one of them .I asked her to change it.she was nervous she took the food in bad way and through away this piece on the counter and picked up another one and through it in my plate .then I asked for a barbecue sauce. She was impatient and picked one and through it in the plate as she did before with the food .I will not go again to this branch. This girl spoiled my night .<//review></record></dataset><record>

So we decided to get just a 4pc so I wouldn't need sauce. Then I'm told they're out of fries which is the only side I normally get. They then said they were also out of green beans. The biscuits were super salty and tasted off. They also messed up our meal. I probably won't be going back there for a while.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Today I went to the Popeye's on magnolia and la palma ,I love Popeye's I'd go almost everyday to the one by my job on hazard and beach this the first time I go to this one didn't even know there was one here,I ordered popcorn shrimp platter the shrimp had it's tail still on,there not suppose to have any shell or tails on them this the first place that I've gone too that has it like that the sprite tasted like alka seltzer and water ,the chicken strips I got my daughter from there had blood on them we dumped the food out waist of 22 dollars ,I rather take that 15 mile drive and go to my old Popeye's than to this one that's about 1 mile away</text>

Worst popeyes location i have ever been too. Before the New manager they were out of everything. No sauces at all no honey not even napkins. Went there yesterday and bought a decent amount of food I was given 2 ranchs i asked for 2 more sauces and they told me no. They would not even sell me 2 more sauces. Who the hell wants to eat dry chicken. Not me I'm about my sauces lol. I will never be going back here. I understand they want to cut back but if I'm willing to pay for 2 more sauces I should be able to purchase them. The wait time is ridiculous. Over 30 minutes in a drive thru line sometimes. Alot of times they dont have mild chicken tenders only hot. Customer service sucks there. I get attitudes from most the people at the drive thru including the manager. Also i thought popeyes comes out with a new 5 dollar box monthly. Not this place . Boneless wings 5 dollar box for over 5 months now.</review>

<review>There's not a lot of Popeye's floating around the neighborhood so any new ones that open up are highly appreciated. There's just nothing exceptional about this location: The food is okay, cleaniness is so-so, service is fine.

That's far better than having something to complain about, in my book.</review>< Pics>

45 min in the drive thru.  Previous reviews were most likely by family members and friends this place is a joke. Everyone in here is so lazy. They don't even care. It's almost like they think they're doing you a favor.< /Text>

Our order was wrong we called them they apologized since we couldn't go back to correct that night but they  took our name an offered a 50% discount on our next visit. Two days later we go to repeat the order and the discount was changed to 10% so we didn't purchase nothing but we did waste our time and gas again .< /Review>

Service is terrible here.  Workers routinely ignore customers.  It appears they are not accustomed to the huge crowds generated by the chicken sandwich.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The food is good but the staff does not know what is selling. he asks one for the specials and they keep looking and then they go and ask the manager. It seems that all the time he has new people.

La comida está buena pero el personal no conoce bien lo que está vendiendo. le pregunta uno por los especiales y se quedan mirando y luego van y preguntan al mánager. Parece que todo el tiempo tiene gente nueva.</Text>
