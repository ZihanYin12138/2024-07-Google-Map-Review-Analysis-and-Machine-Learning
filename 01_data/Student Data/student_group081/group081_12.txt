Paid 89.90 for a more detailed inside but it’s really not great. Really disappointed. I have a truck and the other cars were much nicer I don’t know if that made a difference . But my seats are still dirty I don’t even think they vacuumed it. And the product left behind felt really oily but it looks like they put way too much.  Once they were done they left my shoes on my seat!!! They could’ve just left it at the bottom where they originally were. They even left trash behind . I called to let them know and went back because I mean come on. But left and looked at my dashboard and you could see it’s all sprayed too. Wish I hadn’t come here. Wanted to treat my car. They did vacuum over when I went back but I still expected way better.<//text>

Overall it’s an OK carwash.
I just wish it was hand wash for those prices. It’s a machine wash then they dry it for you. Might as well go into a drive-in wash for a third of the price.

I chose the regular which was 20.99 but at the register it became 23.99. They said it was bec they considered my car an SUV. It’s not a lot of money but I was a bit surprised with the hidden fees. Not cool. Also, why would it matter if the vehicle is being machine washed.
Anyway, it’s just a carwash so whatever.
They vacuumed and dried the vehicle very well.< /Text>

This place is not only a great car wash, they care and you can tell.  The owner is a huge rock and roll fan (obviously hence name) and they always have great music playing and lots of cool pictures hanging on the wall.  It’s also a one stop shop you can pick up birthday cards, snacks, drinks. I highly recommend this car wash if it rains within 48 hours of your wash they will redo it for free. Plus they give you a card after 10 washes you get one for free.<//Review>

<Review>Took my car in with a broken headlight, warned the people who washed the car, beforehand about that so they avoid washing the front entirely, or atleast put a rag on it.
They ended up forgetting i told them and they sprayed water inside the front headlight. USING A PREASURE WASHER. And then to fix this, they used a pressure dryer... which caused the water to flow deeper and mess with all the sensors.
Notice, i got a hand wash for this reason.
They cause electrical issue now i have to replace the whole headlight.
I was offered an EXPRESS wash as a sorry. Pathetic and very unprofessional.
1k down the drain because of something very simple.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I waited to see how the cars get washed and hardly any soap come out and not to say that the guys do not use window cleaner, just their towels and they did not vacuum my car right. from window had smudges and the interior you can tell they just  did a quick wipe. My package that I purchase called for tire dressing and air freshener and they did not put either or. It's expensive and they do a poor job! I will not recommend this place to anyone.<//Review>< user_id>

I rolled into Rock 'n Roll Car Wash and rocked a deal...kinda.

I offered $50 bucks for a 59.99 wash 'n wax and dude agreed.

Dropped car off, returned an hour later - car looked pretty good...until I returned home and found lots of dirt spots that were quickly waxed over instead of cleaned off.

So, I took my bottle of wax and a rag, spent 10 minutes with minimal effort and BOOM, car looked great!

I had thought about getting the full detail, glad I didn't because I don't think the rockers at R & R Car Wash would have delivered the goods.

Not bad, not great - 3.5 stars.

Might try again, might not?< /review>

< review>
Picked up my car and drove home.  It was then I noticed that the plastic grille had not been treated.  Also, plastic trim on the lift gate was not detailed properly.  Immediately returned to the car wash.  Being irate, I pointed out the deficiencies.  They told me the grille was weathered and couldn't be restored.  Meguires makes black plastic restore liquid.  They put some of their liquid on it which didn't help.  They then used something abrasive on the rear plastic piece which scratched it and told me other blemishes couldn't be corrected.  Back at home I used cleaner wax to restore the rear plastic trim.  Tomorrow I'll buy some Meguiars black plastic restore liquid for the grille.   Then I noticed that paint had been ground off the passenger side door handles.  Also, many imperfections were missed on the roof.  Never again.<//review>

Wow! Super great place! Excellent service, and knowledgable staff, Chui is the man! Great prices! Great work, I got thr hand wash option for my new mustang GT but they have a cheaper machine wash option that uses cloth cleaners instead of the abrassive plastic ones you see in the other guys places. I recommend it.< /Text>

Black cars are hard to clean. I'll go with that, since my car came out with a few water splotch spots, but you can't expect a detail job from a drive in drive out wash. You just come with mid to low level expectations and expect everything to turn out A-OK. And A-OK it was, hell my car needed this for the nice sunny day.

Here's the format for the former self-washers, like myself. You drive up to the yellow line, leave the keys in the car, someone asks you what kinda wash you want and maybe up-sells a bit. Take the receipt to the cashier then you wait on your car with the other folks. I usually like to tip the persons drying my car at that time, but here they have a big sealed tip box with a sign that said they shared tips. I even saw the owner come out to help dry my car. I like that sort of humbling thing.

-=-11 bucks-=- For a vacuum and wash, now that's a deal. From where I'm from, I would pay almost twice that. I dig it. If I lived around here, I probably would have been a repeat customer. Is this really the "Only hand wash in South Bay"?. If it was, I was lucky to have stumbled upon it with my dirty car needs.< /text>

< Review>
I was surprised by the older reviews. I bought a full detail, but didn't have the time to have it done that day, so they did a normal wash for free and told me to come back when I have time. The wash was great for a quick place, not to mention as a free bonus, and they said the full detail will take 2-3 hours when I come back, not 45 mins. I believe it is under new management. They were great, but I will have the detail done before I can give them 5 stars.< /Review>

At first I thought they had very fast service and helpful staff, as soon as I got home and inspected my car, it was not as clean as I thought it would be. Few of the bird poop was not completely cleaned off and the windows had a lot of streaks. It was more like the service was rushed at the end of the day</Review>

It's actually pretty cool as long as you tip really really well they will take a lot of time and really do cool stuff on your vehicle but again only if you tip really really well which is kind of common sense but if you tip really will will take good care of you.</review>

The worst customer service ever.
I understand that they're quite expensive, and I don't mind it if they were doing a good job!
I paid $270 for full detail and after I got the 4 hours later it still not completely clean as "full detail" it was just like any regular $15 hand wash
Never recommend it and never coming back again</Text>

Your car does not come out clean they miss spots. You have to tell them they do it over and still the damn thing is not done right. I can't believe rated number 1. Wow just visited on 3-19-2016. For the price please do it right the first time. Will I ever go back NO.< /Review>

It seems it depends on how busy they are how good your car comes out. Even after paying for the whole band there was still grit on my carpets because they were to busy or didn't care to lift the mats and vacuum the carpet</text>

I got my three year old sons hair cut here. The man was so kind and gentle. Sam loved the experience & the cut was perfect. I brought a pic to show him kind of what I wanted and turned out better plus a lollipop 🍭<//text>

Been going here for decades. Best barbershop on the peninsula. I don't even have to say anything after I get in the chair, they know what I want without prompting. Even though my favorite is Rich and I try to go when he is there, I get a great cut from any chair.< /Text>

<text>This is a total joke of a barbershop. A guy called rick 'cut' my hair; in over 30 years of getting haircuts, he is the first one to not shave the back of my head. Chopped off a bunch of hair off the top of my head without any method - it doesn't look great. Didn't have the heart to tell him myself after the haircut given everything they've been through with COVID - but recommend going somewhere else for sure.</text>< Pics>

I went to get a simple haircut. He cut it way too short, horribly shaped, and uneven. I payed $40, to look like I hacked at my head with scissors on my own. Not going back< /text>

<review>Ray did not disappoint. It’s a friendly place that’s family owned in a town where that’s rare nowadays. 30 bucks for a haircut.

An old school barbershop - Took a friend for a hair cut and he was amazed on how they vacuum your head to get rid of the little hairs. Perfect spot for business men, athletes , or children. You can be stylish or  frumpishly technical and they will try to get you the haircut to seek.< /text>

Best haircut ever! A little pricey but totally worth for quality. They even have a little vacuum at the end to suck up all the loose hairs on your head. The best part, No talking just watching sports.< /review>

< Review>
We arrived an hour before closing and the guy said as long as we can eat with in the hour then we can sit down to eat. Nice little spot but don't go an hour before closing. Our food was not warm but luke warm. Not sure if it was only heated slightly so we could eat faster but the sauce for the chicken enchiladas was just to much of a sweet mole sauce. Not my preference. I like my mole sauce more savory but keep in mind I was eating chicken enchiladas so the mole sauce just did not taste great. They did give alot of sour cream and fake guacamole. Beans were dried and the rice was the only thing I liked on the plate. My husband had to force him self to eat his wet burrito because he was hungry but would not go back either. Because it was the end of the night our food was packed in to go clamshells. We were hoping for hot food but no success. I do not recommend this place.< /Review>

<text>I also drive for Uber Eats and pick up orders here nearly every day.

Today I decided to eat here myself.

I ordered the cheese enchiladas with black beans. It's rare that I don't enjoy a Mexican style meal. Even rarer, though, that I feel completely satisfied.

I felt completely satisfied with my choice and the price.

The restaurant is quaint, a good atmosphere.

Definitely understand why people order from here.< /text><date>1561756851889<//date><username>Earl T. Roske</username>< gmap_id>

In the last five months, I have visited Taqueria Azteca twice and have ended up with food poisoning TWICE. I really think this restaurant needs to be inspected by California FDB to ensure proper food safety. I wanted to give this restaurant a second chance, but after the same food borne illness this time around I'm leaving a one star review.</text>

<review>Lovely food. The taste is very different from most other places around here. They have birria tacos. And the taco stuffing taste is out of this world. The enchiladas are very different from the regular ones you get else where. My daughter did not like the taste so much but I loved it.
And they have a huge wet mojado burrito which my son demolished. All in all great value for money. Order on their website instead of using Doordash or other apps. You'll pay much less.< /review><gmap_id>0x808fec6bf246e1d5:0xb462d9ba0b360c30</gmap_id>< Pics>

Had Tacos al Pastor and Quesabirrias.  Very very good tacos!  My suggestion try TWO tacos at a time, it was a chilly afternoon, so the third taco was cold.
For me, Mexico City borned and raised, best tacos in the TriValley!< /Review>

One of my fav quick bite place.... very famous and to the standards.  Their taste and quality is never compromised . Good presentation,  good portion size.. i love the burritos and tacos both...had once tried their combo meals too affordable and filling. The freshness of salads and the quality of meat is upto the mark. Without a doubt one can order and enjoy the meal. Highly recommended one.< /Review>

<rate>4</rate><Review>Went here for lunch the other day. I knew this place when the Asian guy owned it (a few years ago?). They always made quality and quantity, reasonably priced. The salsa bar was the best in the area. No more salsa bar/Covid.

Well, the prices increased (about 30%). Quality was still OK and portions are smaller. A regular burrito is now $10. I asked for shredded chicken, refried beans (not whole beans) and no rice. The burrito was 70% refried beans and 30% chicken (a few chunks). It was tasty but it was mostly refried beans. They also put some pico de gallo on the inside as well.

Service was good (got the burrito in about 7 minutes - it wasn't busy/I went in just after 1015am). Basically, paying much more, for smaller portions and less meat.

Fortunately, there are many other places in the area that give quality and quantity for about the same price (Los Perricos to name one).</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

HOUR long wait for ONE order of carne asada fries, not during a busy time at all. Frankly not worth it, especially when there’s plenty of higher quality, more affordable Mexican restaurants in the area.</Text>

Every dish was delicious, well packed with all the fixings on the side. Probably one of the best pozole and menudos I've had in a long time! I certainly will be ordering from them again!! ❤️❤️❤️< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Restaurant was rather chilly temperature wise on the inside. Average food selection, no frills. Open chip bar was nice, tortilla chips were really good. Ordered a fried burrito and shrimp tacos. Food was extremely bland, all the flavor came from the hot sauce I put on it. Nothing exciting
Average experience, wouldn't come here again . Too many other options are available.</review>

My 1st visit and the service was really good. Was greeted with a smile and friendly hello. My food was ready to go within a reasonable about of time, not a long wait at all....the burrito flavor, interior was too salty for me. It could also be that I don't eat a lot of salt on my food. So, I'll definitely try eating here again because I like to give places a 2nd chance, but I won't order the super 🐓 chicken burrito 🌯 again.< /review>

<Review>I ordered two regular burritos through EatStreet — carne asada and pollo asado, both with cheese added ($1+) and without salsa fresca. The total ended up as ~$26 and... Strips of raw tomato and onions in every bite. I also asked for extra napkins and lime — neither came. There was the extra cheese I paid for at least.

I have a food intolerance to raw onions, so the mix up is more than just a little upsetting. I have a high chance of vomiting all night and I am just. Very upset to put it very mildly.

Authentic Mexican restaurant with very good price and big menu. They always have freshly cooked chips for customers to enjoy while waiting for their food. Although this is not a full-service restaurant, the staffs here are very accommodating and give good service.< /Text>

<Review>Steve V. I hear you, tried to order online and it automatically tip them self's so I phone in the order and the person was rude on the phone also I order a street shrimp taco and they put lettuce and ranch on it. Lol it was disgusting the quesobirria was soggy and also disgusting. Will definitely not be coming back. 10$ for 2 tacos and they want tip on top, no thanks. Tacos should be cilantro and onions that's it and not 10$ for 2 tacos plus tip.</Review><rating>1</rating>< user_name>

Go somewhere else. There are plenty of other Mexican options in the Dublin area. Ordered tamales and pozole for a to-go order on a quiet Tuesday evening. For those unfamiliar, these should be "easy to serve" foods from a restaurant standpoint. Not here at Taqueria Azteca. It took more than 45 minutes for the order to be ready. No communication from the staff or apologies of any kind about the excessively long wait time. We FINALLY get the food only to discover that the tamales I ordered for my 4 year old have hot sauce smothered on them. Unfortunately, I made the discovery after leaving the restaurant so there was nothing I could do about it. What a complete waste of my time and money. Absolutely infuriating experience.<//text>

Great taco joint in Dublin.  All the typical taco joint items, served fresh and fast.  The woman who typically prepares the food does everything right there for you to see.  Always have fresh salsa variety and tortilla chips self serve. Great burritos, tacos, etc.< /review>

Even though I am of Mexican descent, and my Spanish is not that good...
They were very courteous to me in English as well as in Spanish...
But the food was well worth it...
It was just as good as Mi Mama home cooking...

<Review>Ordered food 4/10 and all the items were terrible! We ordered Asada street taco, asada quesadilla and chicken quesadilla. The tortillas were stale, and all the meat in every item we ordered was completely dried out. This is the second time in a row we have gotten poor quality food from this place. First time we thought it was a fluke, new cook, not anymore!!! We will not go back.< /Review>< user_id>

<Review>I am updating my review here from 4 star to 1 based on my latest experience here. We loved everything the first time, our order was right and the experience was good. This time they made multiple mistakes. I ordered a super burrito with no meat, husband ordered the Carne Asada fries no sour cream both to go. First they called our number but forgot it was to go so they had to put it in bags, no big deal. Then we noticed they gave my husband sour cream so we asked them to take it off before we left which they did no problem. We got home and started to try and eat only for me to find that my burrito was full of meat, ground beef that was mixed all the way through. I have IBSD and meat is a trigger food for me so I couldn't eat any of it. Tried to call them and they never answered the phone. Not going back and will not recommend<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I was just there 10 minutes ago. I literally had to walk out due to the woman cooking with the bad attitude and she made my food wrong, not once but twice and I had to correct her for it. For $35 I would expect the food to at least be good. I doubt I’d ever come back to this place again... not because of the woman but because of the salty food and terrible customer service. If it were possible I would give this place minus 10 stars and that’s an understatement. That’s all folks🙌🏻<//review>

This place was great the first time I came for my usual plate, but the second time I found a long hair on the tongs used for the chips. This might have been from someone working here, but it also could have easily been from a customer, so that does not matter to me as much. The food is very tasty and fresh. They have a great salsa bar with good descriptions of each salsa. The workers are friendly and it is a great place to go whether you want to dine in or eat on the run. I always receive my meal promptly when I eat here.<//review>

Stopped in here when I just happened to be in the area.  I'm glad I did!  The food was flavorful and well prepared.   They had a "help yourself" bar for chips, a variety of salsas, and other toppings/condiments. The staff were friendly and prices were very reasonable.  I'll definitely stop by again next time I happen to be in the area!</text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>This place deserves 0 STARS!!! Last night was my first and last time going here. As I approached the register to place my order, I seen a worker using her red stained apron to dry or wipe her hands off. This was my 1st sign to turn around and leave, but No, I gave her the benefit of the doubt, thinking that she had just washed her hands and made a poor decision, and besides, she was only taking my order and not preparing my food. From the beginning, it seemed as if the lady did not want to serve me, but I convinced myself that I was over exaggerating, although I said thank you to the lady at least 3 times, she never acknowledged back. Anyways, I order the $8 nachos without meat and my daughter ordered $7 kids cheese enchilada (1 enchilada, a tiny side of rice & a drink). My nachos were horrible! Tasted like the chips had been cooked in old nasty grease and they were greasy. The topping were very very skimpy and the lady overcharged me $10 (the price as if I had ordered nachos with meat. As my food was being prepared, I went to the restroom. I had to walk through the kitchen and another back area. There was a bowl of meat just sitting out uncover. The floor, walls and entire interior of the place looked grease, dirty, nasty and had this awful smell.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Very bad service! All women working were very rude and gave attitude while ordering. After us a couple of women were ordering food, and the cashier was sooo upset with her because she didn’t know the name of the sauce. She was very disrespectful and made people uncomfortable. The place was so dirty, WOULD not recommend. Food wasn’t even great. It was very bland.<//Text>< Pictures>

I wish we could give half stars because I'd probably lean towards a 4.5 yet they seem to deserve more than a 4… that's not the only dilemma.

Once you set foot inside Taqueria Azteca the real problem begins… what to order because EVERYTHING is amazing!  Keep it up, me and my tummy thank you. ;)</Text>

<Review>Visited this restaurant not realizing it was a 'place your order and then find a seat' type of place. I ordered a shredded beef quesadilla and also tried a few salsa varieties from their salsa bar. Everything was very tasty! Sometimes shredded beef dishes can be rather bland and I'm happy that was not the case here!< /Review></record>

<text>Food was good, great chips.

The restaurant is a bit dark and the prices were a touch on the higher side for a taqueria, but they don't charge for chips which was good. Being in Dublin, I expected it to be subpar and overpriced, so this was a nice surprise.< /text>< Pictures>

This is my first time at this business. It had a welcoming and warm family feel to it which I loved!!! I ordered the shrimp burrito. Maaaaaan!!! I could barely finish it because it was super stuffed!!! Affordable pricing! And free chips!! Will be coming back again with the family next time!!!</Review>

Tried the chicken quasedilla, carnitas chimichanga and the super burrito with grilled chicken here - all were packed with flavor and taste. Salsa bar has a lot of salsas to choose from - as well as jalapenos, radishes, carrots and roasted onions to go with the very fresh and crispy nachos. The ambience has nice artwork which gives the place warmth and character. All in all a nice Mexican place for great food with family and friends.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Good tacos. I watched people respond poorly to the price, but the portions are fair and filling.

Service wasn't awesome, but it was what I expect at a proper taqueria.< /review>

The ladies working were super nice. Now the bad part, I ordered 2 beef enchiladas with rice and beans (combination). The enchiladas are a complete joke, it is a tortilla with a teaspoon of ground meat rolled and covered in sauce. My pinky finger is bigger. Now imagine two of these on a huge plate of beans and rice. I didn't order rice and beans with a side of two tiny pencil sized enchiladas! Twelve dollars for dinner? and I could of ate myself sick at taco bell for nine dollars?.  Another issue was on their guacamole, avocados are expensive and delicious, you mash and LIGHTLY season them for the flavor to come out. They destroy perfectly good avocados with massive amounts of lime juice. YUCK! Why not just add lime juice to mayonnaise, if all you want is lime flavored goo.

So at the end of the day, there biggest problem for me is value. I felt like my 12 bucks got me a big plate of beans and red sauce. Too bad, they could have a great business if they just made good food at a good value.<//Review>

I love this taqueria. I discovered this place many years ago with a friend when I first moved out here. I actually live in Danville but end up finding excuses to come out here with my mom. I love the potato burrito but really, everything is good. The salsas are very fresh and flavorful and the portions are very generous. I love the homemade chips and quality ingredients.  I feel like the same staff is always there when I am and they are all very hospitable and nice. I think one of the main employees is named Stefany and we love catching up and sharing antics about our conures! I love the murals in the restaurant and have and will continue to recommend this place to all my friends!< /Text>

We were looking for a quick bote on our way though town. I got the taco salad. There was very little lettuce on this salad. It was adversized to have romaine lettuce but came with iceburg & they didnt have ranch dressing. I was disappointrd with the salsa bar- the salsas didnt have the good flavoring. Over all I thought it was a bit overpriced for thw quality of food.</Text>

Ordered the chorizo tacos and there was only a spoonful of chorizo on each taco and it wasn't even good. Had better chorizo tacos in northwest Louisiana.</review>

Customer service was ok but not satisfied at all with the food they Got out order wrong the meat was salty and not much sour cream on one of our orders....this is a place we Googled  and liked the rates so we decided to stop on our way home mind you we are from out of town and the prices was very high as if it was a restaurant so with that said $50 plus just was wasted!!!<//Review>

< Review>
Today I was in this restaurant spending around $90 dollars to obtain a bad service where the cook came out to yell at us angry and grumpy that order 13 was ready, he did not have the delicacy of informing that they did not take the food to the  table but one has to go and pick it up a terrible service the truth is not even for a star reaches this restaurant I do not recommend it for its bad service.<//Review>

<user>106242675564818334271<//user><text>(Translated by Google) It is very true that they treat customers so badly the cashier is a bitter woman who seems to weigh her life and she even gets upset because you ask for your receipt, oh, I treat myself so badly that I never return apart, she throws the sauces to one of you and that. not well ! do not come if you do not want to have a bad time with this place apart from the food or it is good

(Original)
Es muy cierto que tratan tan mal a los clientes la cajera es una amargada que parece que le pesa su vida y hasta se molesta porque pides tu recibo ah mi me trato tan mal que no regreso jamás aparte le hace tirada las salsas a uno y eso no está bien ! no vengan si no quieren tener un mal rato con este lugar aparte la comida ni la está buena<//text><Name>Karly Bran<//Name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmapID>0x808fec6bf246e1d5:0xb462d9ba0b360c30< /gmapID>< Response>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The one who attends, definitely needs to find another job, very bad treatment of clients, gentlemen, if you don't want to have a bad day, don't visit taqueria Azteca, not until they change the cashier, the impertinent chubby, very bad treatment.

Compared to other shops I have used. These guys are honest, quick and very truthful when they tell you what is wrong, when it will be done, and how much it will cost. I definitely will recommend them plus use them in the future.</Text>

< Review>
Worst mechanic I've ever been to and that's saying something. I didn't think they could top from being worse than my last mechanic who jabbed his finger into my car's still fresh seal for the oil. But they did, they literally didn't do anything to my van and I got it back in worse condition than I gave it to them! They claim no one worked on it yet why was my fuse box open? Not only that, the windows stopped working and now every time I stop the car it makes terrible popping noises from the front left side. I checked the hood and see they been sticking their hands in there as well. They also ruined my brother's jeep and destroyed the threads of his oil pan! Learn from our mistake and do NOT let them service your vehicle.<//Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Let down after the first time I came some years back I received amazing service. 2nd and third time around was enough to never make me go back again and to any looking to use their emissions repair voucher should look else where. They wanted $1400 to “repair to pass smog” but truth is they were just gonna replace a bunch of parts and hope for the best. And this is after the second time I went to them for the same emissions issue they never originally fixed to begin with, the first time they just replaced the gas cap and wiped the codes and said that costed $750(what used to be the vouchers Max worth, which is now $850). $100 crankshaft position sensor and a YouTube video later problem solved don’t get ripped off trying to help the economy!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Overly priced, charged me 1160.21 for a new catalytic converter and o2 sensor. A new California legal catalytic converter cost $205 they charged me$525.
I bought and installed a new o2 sensor for $55 a week before taking it here, they replaced my new o2 sensor and threw it away. Sold me a new o2 sensor for $190.44. Don't bring your car here, you're better off taking it to a mobile mechanic that will show you and explain what they are doing to your car and won't charge you these prices. 377.50 for labor and 715.44 for parts that would cost 260.<//Text>< rating>

If you want an honest car repair shop this is the place! From the moment I walked into the front office the guys Steven and Dakota are very welcoming and professional. They kept me informed step by step thru the repair of my vehicle and explained my bill to me. The mechanics did an amazing job. All around I am very happy with this shop.< /text>

<review>Went to maybe four or five places before this, with a rare and quirky vehicle that would not pass (or fail) smog. They kept telling me to do drive cycles which never set the sensors. So I finally was referred here, they had it passed the next morning, after a year of trouble with other places that didn't care enough to put time in. They are professional and courteous, highly recommend.</review>< pics>

<text>Needed my front wheel bearing replaced. I usually work on my car myself but I didn't have the tools needed for the job. I called around to several shops and most of them had no idea how to replace a front wheel bearing or at least what was involved.  McWiliams and Walden was recommended by a mechanic friend of mine. They emailed me a quote, we're prompt in getting me the quote. Steven helped me and new exactly what I needed. They are competitively priced, but more important they know what they are doing and do it well. Great job!< /text>< rate>

Called at 8:00 am. Explained our travel plans and they told me to bring it over. Wouldn’t start so I had to have our motor home towed to there shop. Had it there by 11:30. They called me at 12:20 with their diagnosis and were given the go ahead to fix it. Called me back at 2:50 and it was fixed. Our travel plans are back on track. Would highly recommend these guys for their professionalism in their work, fair pricing and great people to do business with. Thank you for the great job done.< /Text>

I was recommended by a mechanic to come here for a smog pass on my truck. My experience here was terrible and they were coming up with excuses on why for me to spend more money. They said they were going to fix the sensors and in which when I got my truck back I tooo it back to another smog specialist and they said they werent done. They said that the truck sensors had not been changed and that nothing was done. I would not take my vehicle here again as they did not do there job and lied about the parts they supposebly fixed.<//Review>

< Review>
I took the car to get a catalytic converter and they told me I was supposed to pay a certain amount which was less than what they actually charged me. Also, when they gave me the car back I took a look at it and realized it was not the right car part. I returned to the person who had helped me and they said that the original part doesn’t exist. In that moment I called the dealer and asked for the part and they told me the original part did exist and could be done in less than 10mins. Overall wouldn’t go back they aren’t telling you all the details and lie about what parts they are putting into your car.<//Review>

Best most honest mechanic shop in town. About the only shop in town that won't fix things that u don't ask them to without calling you first, resulting in costing you arm-and-a leg extra that you might not have. This is the only place I will ever bring my cars to. Usually very fast turn around too!</text>

I called McWilliams and Walden Inc to get an oil change. They took my car in when I was available. At entry, I was greeted by the wonderful staff. Dakotah was very instrumental in servicing my vehicle. I’ve gone to other car service companies and neither one of them had the brand of oil my car needed. McWilliams and Walden Inc had my oil in stock and as a matter of fact, my oil change was a lot cheaper than where I usually take my car for service. The mechanics did a full spectrum of my car and found different problems that needed attention. Rotors needed servicing and two tires needed replacing. I was more than happy to return toMcWilliams and Walden Inc. They now have a new customer. I will soon be taking my husbands vehicle to be serviced. Thank you Dakota for your service.</review>

<Review>McWilliams & Walden is a truly outstanding automotive shop. I went in today and needed my oil changed, tires rotated, and new windshield wipers and from the start I felt very welcome. Everyone is very friendly, especially Dakotah at the front desk, and knowledgeable. All the work was done in a timely manner and the pricing was great. I hardly had to wait. I will definitely be returning.</Review>< response>

<text>McWilliams and Walden have helped my business continue to run.  My van working is essential to keeping my clients happy.  McWilliams and Walden took care of all issues I had with my old van.   Longest downtime was 2 days for a new transmission.  They will continue to service my new work van for the next 10+ years.   Highly recommend them for there work ethics and honesty.<//text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I'm not one to write reviews but felt my recent required smog visit, gotta love California, warranted this review. My Honda failed the smog test and I was told there would be an additional fee to diagnose the issue in order to make the necessary repairs. Once I agreed the young man with the cute lil baby face named Josh immediately took over the procedure and found the problem within mere moments. Turned out some doohickey had melted on this thingamajig. Come on folks I'm a woman! Anyway dakotah informed me they wouldn't  charge me the diagnostic fee or even for the repair since it was so minor and Josh would have it repaired in 5 minutes or so. Needless to say my car was back on the smog machine and passed with flying colors !! How can you not love an honest repair shop  in this day age?  I have to say I was impressed with my visit and will only come here for all my future smog tests
no matter how many smog stations I have to pass to get here.  I also know if any other issues should arise I won't hesitate to bring my car to these guys. Thanks again for everything and for keeping my car on the road ! McWilliams & Walden rocks !!!!!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

As the owner of HJR Concrete Designs, Our trucks are a vital asset to our company's success. When one of them developed some drivability issues a friend of mine who is also a long time  customer of McWilliams and Walden recommended I take it there. My experience with these guys turned out to be the best experience I've ever had dealing with a repair facility. My truck was repaired sooner than expected which is
A+ in my book but while I was there I discovered they also sell tires as well as alignments so I immediately scheduled to bring  my truck in for tires as well as an alignment. I dropped my vehicle off and received a call regarding worn suspension components which apparently was the reason my tires were worn as well as causing my alignment to be off. The chubby gray haired fella that was doing the alignment  (I can't recall his name but I believe he's the back shop manager) seemed knowledgeable and was extremely friendly, I later learned this gentleman has over 30 yrs front end experience. (Explains the gray hair ) LOL!  Wow was I impressed with that. I then knew my truck was in the hands of a true professional. Again my truck was completed ahead of schedule and has never ran or felt so solid driving down the road. Thank you Gary and that chubby gray haired suspension guru for solving my
trucks issues you now have a customer for life and I will not hesitate to send friends and family your way.</review>

Motor home diesel hard starting so called and made appt. to take in for repair. Upon starting fine when going in they took time to try and find a problem. Motorhome started fine all day while they checked various items. Called and they said I could pick it up. Started great when we got there. They said because they couldn't find a problem there would not be a charge. Unheard of in this day and age. Thank you so much for your efforts and amazing business practice.< /review>

I can't say enough great things about these guys I've been doing business with Gary and his team of professional knowledgeable technicians  for more years than I can remember (20 +yrs ) the shop is clean well maintained & equipped with the latest technology.  having an automotive  background myself when I was a youngr lad working in the industry from BMW to Detroit diesels and most anything in between I can't say enough about the knowledge this team possesses if I were ever told I had a repair that is dealer recommended I wouldn't hesitate to contact Gary first to find out if he and his team are capable and equipped to handle the task as I definitely trust this team more than any dealership (remember I worked for dealerships )  also after being ripped off by shady smog shops in this town (thank you California) I trust no one doing my smogs except for these trustworthy guys I have refered countless people to Gary's awesome team and all have become faithful customers telling me their experiences were like none they'd ever experienced with any other shop I currently own 5 vehicles and what I don't maintain myself these guys do plus all 5 cars are rolling on tires bought and maintained by this staff  as well as alignments which is a huge plus being able to have my vehicles and tires maintained at one location I'll end this review now since I've already said I can't say enough about this awesome group of technicians< /text>

<Review>Took my Dodge Stratus here a few years ago for a new water pump.  They told me I needed some other part not related to the water pump, and it would be over $700.  I told them I didn't have the money for that right now, just to fix the water pump.  When I went to pick my car up, they had installed a different part that wasn't related to the water pump, said they went ahead and did it since the water pump was out of the way.  I was not made aware of it, nor did I approve of it!!!  Total cost for a new water pump - over $700!!  I was so mad!  Then on the way home, something did not seem right, so I took it to the shop in Oildale.  The previous mechanic did not tighten down the alternator, which shredded the belt, so I had to pay another $150 to the guys in Oildale for a new alternator belt to make up for their mistake!!  And they call themselves Christians!!  I WILL NEVER EVER TAKE MY CAR HERE AGAIN!!!  AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!!  I only put one star because it is not possible to put NO STARS FOR THIEVING SERVICE!!!!  I posted this review years ago, but it somehow got deleted.</Review>< userid>

My emissions failed on my car, I took to Bob's Muffler who referred me to McWilliams & Warden, They told me it was my catalytic converter and my O2 sensor. I had it replaced. I asked how much it would cost for a couple other services while I was waiting for the catalytic converter to come in. They did it at no charge without hesitation. Above all they were honest and had the best possible service, something you wouldn't expect from an automotive repair shop. They went above and beyond my expectations. I highly recommend them, as they got a loyal customer out of me. Thank you Gary<//Review>

Agreed to a 110 dollar diagnostics but when I picked the truck up it cost 240 dollars! Never was notified of price. Had the truck approximately  1 hour and had to have it towed back to shop. Told then that it was a bare wire. Ended up paying 545 dollars for a bare wire. I took it to dodge to have it checked and it's like a 30 minute job to do what they did. I could have done it with some shrink tubing also. Left me feeling really cheated. Oh well!!!!!🤐< /text>

<review>Don't you hate those garages, or dealers, who are just part replacers or want to sell you so much more than your car really needs?  Their estimates always look like more when it comes time to paying.  THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN at McWilliams & Walden.  Have been going here since 2008.  Honest, awesome customer service, quality work, no BS.  Alignments, tires, brakes, oil changes, and STAR certified smog testing.

March 2021,
The last week of February 2021 I brought my car in for an oil change and tire rotation.  The assigned mechanic completed those tasks and upon inspection noticed that one strut assembly was leaking, and a motor mount was cracked and near failing.  I returned a week or so later and had the struts and motor mounts replaced.  The mechanic then noticed a coolant leak.  The leak was traced to the lower portion of the timing chain cover.  The garage replaced the cover seal.  Close inspection after the disassembly showed the seal had pinched during assembly at the factory causing a bad seal and galvanic corrosion between the iron block and aluminum cover.  This was a very serious problem.  Had it not been found it could have become larger and completely failed.  The engine would have lost all coolant, seriously overheated, and basically burned up.  This could have happened at any time or place.  I cannot thank McWilliams and Walden's entire cadre enough for outstanding dedication to caring for customers and their cars.<//review><date>1615503056270<//date>< UserId.>

HORRIBLE!!!!  What a RIP OFF!!!!   Over $700 for a freakin' water pump for my  '97 car!!!! They told me it also needed a new pulley spring for $130.  I said no, it's already costing me too much,  just replace the water pump.  So they found something else that cost about the same and replaced that without even asking me first, and charged me for it!!!  Then a week later, my alternator belt shreds! I take to my regular boys over at Sierra Automotive (where I should have taken it in the first place) and they said the alternator was hanging by one bolt, and that's what shredded my belt!  These over charging clowns at Mc Waldon & Mc Williams didn't even tighten down my alternator when they finished putting the water pump in it!  Another $135 for the new alternator belt!!  I DO NOT recommend these fools to ANYONE!!!!<//Review>

<review>I sent my car in because the gage said it was over heating. After I picked up my car I stopped to get gas. Then I took it to the car wash after the wash I was drying my windows  & I noticed a trail of sum thing black so I touched it & realized it was gas, so I immediately called & explained & he  basically told me that it didn't happen at their shop & it had to be sum thing I did. That's pretty messed up. My drive way is slanted, trust me I would have noticed any kind of leak. Then he tells me to bring it in like im going to drive around with a gas leak come on, I had it towed from my drive way cause I seen my gage go up to high, oh yeah I don't have any kind of stains on my drive way. I wanted them to fix what they broke, but my friends told me to go to another shop. I would take pictures of everything before you give it to this shop...</review>< username>

<Text>Was Great, until I received Truck here in NY. I was sent no title and evidently the paperwork has not been processed yet. Paperwork was done and truck ready to be shipped by 5-15, I received on 5/30 and knew I was missing the title to Register in NY. I called manager 6/2 was told I need to get thru Bank. I called bank and they do not have from dealership. The Bank told me they reached out to them with no response. I called today only to be told they have 90 days to file this paperwork even though they can go to DMV any day. When I questioned when it was filed he told me it's ready to go Monday????
I understand you have time by State Law, but common sense would suggest that I bought a vehicle and would prefer to be able to drive it.
Unfortunately the guy hung up on me because I was not very nice with him, for that I do not blame him. But my frustration having a vehicle that is insured and I've made a payment on but I can't drive is too much for me to handle.
In the end I'm most disappointed the nobody cares enough to help me expedite what I need to enjoy my purchase. This incident took a happy purchase to I wish I had never done it.

Drove up from the east bay.  Test drove a car that started smoking 10 minutes in due to an oil leak.  This was after I was told they checked it.  I was told they would fix it.  I said I would still like to buy the car after the repair was made.  I called the following night at the close of their day and was told it was repaired .  We agreed on a price and I was told I could come sign the papers the next day.   I was called at the start of the next day telling me the car was still in the shop and it had been sold to someone else.< /text>

<Response>{'time': 1617935959188, 'text': 'In response to Brian C \'s Google review.  Brian, we are sorry you feel that way. However, you are completely incorrect in your view and perspective on how we handled your situation regarding the Subaru Forester. Charlie the salesperson that was working with you did tell you that the oil leak would be checked to make sure that was the problem and if so that it would be fixed prior to you purchasing the vehicle. We were aware that you wanted to purchase the vehicle after the repairs were done.  Charlie also called you to follow up and to give you first opportunity to buy the car. Charlie informed you on the day the car would be ready and you told him that you couldn\'t make it that day. Unfortunately, you were not the only buyer interested in this vehicle, which was mentioned to you by Charlie. Charlie also informed you that we do not hold or reserve vehicles for anyone, as we have a  first come first serve policy. Sadly for you Brian, one of the other buyers that came to buy the car really wanted it and went ahead and bought it while it was going through the repairs. Charlie was also kind enough to give you a "Courtesy" call and let you know that the vehicle was sold instead of just having you drive from East bay and find out that the vehicle was sold when you got here( as many other dealers would have done). Furthermore, when Charlie mentioned that the vehicle had been sold, you went ahead and began threatening him and telling him that "it was your car and that when you arrive that we better have the car for you"! Brian, the vehicle was never yours, it was never on hold, or reserved for you, nor did you leave a deposit with the sold contract agreement  for you to feel that the vehicle was yours and you had rights to that vehicle. All in all Brian, your review has no validity for the simple reason that your review is coming from an upset individual due to the car being sold before you could come back and buy it. We understand how losing a car you wanted can be frustrating, Brian, this is why Charlie was very clear when working with you. Best of Luck in your search Brian.'}</Response><Gmap_id>0x809ad98cbfc6b6fd:0x575460cf8ce3eb6a< /Gmap_id></record>

For over a week I was in email/text contact with Mani who was very professional and helpful. Mani even help take the vehicle to a pre-purchase inspection at a auto-shop I scheduled. On the day of the purcahse Raad was pretty damn rad and easy and quick to deal with. No BS, no nonsense, and so far a quality vehicle. (But no worries- all their vehicles come with a 3-month, 3,000 mile warranty.)<//review>< Pictures>

Has a good mix of sporty, luxury and economy vehicles. The dealership is clean with no sales pressure.  The owner and staff are car enthusiasts and it shows with the inventory presentation. There were a bunch of 1 owner low mileage examples.
I came in 1 hour till closing and they did not rush to close. They discussed the driving charateristics of my options which helped me narrow my choice.
Vehicles come with a 90 day warranty and theft protection. Mine came with Michelin Pilot tires which are a nice bonus. It is rare to find dealers who back pre owned vehicles. I highly recommend them.  👍</text>

<text>Outstanding customer service! I was looking for a specific car and saw that they had one. I went to look at it the next day and it was immaculate. Their entire lot of vehicles looked great. I dealt with Raad and Mike. Both were phenomenal! They really stand behind their cars. I ended up purchasing the car and they fixed a small issue with the car that they did not have to do, and even stayed late to get it done. There were no pushy salesmen and no pressure at all. I will definitely be back when I need another vehicle. 5 stars all the way around!

Great dealer with professional personnel.  So far above what you envision when thinking about a used car dealer.  Walk in, ask for the car you’re interested in, get the keys and drive out for a test drive.  Come back.  Ask your questions; no pressure, only clear answers.  AJ and Moe-A are excellent representatives for this dealership. Went home to think  about it.  Called in the morning and had a deal by afternoon.  They agreed to a stipulation I made,, didn’t even need a Due-bill.  Took the car back in the next week and everything done as promised.  First used car I have purchased in many years but I would not hesitate to recommend West Coast to friends<//text>

I was on the hunt for a very specific model minivan (2006-2010 Toyota Sienna). The one at this dealership seemed overpriced at first, but when I test drove the car I realized why. They said they wouldn’t budge on the price because they know what they got (this is commonly said), but I was glad to see that the price they were asking was fair. It was the nicest, smoothest, most fully functional Toyota Sienna van I test drove that day. The dealership building was in beautiful condition with new flooring, so that was a plus. The guy who showed me the vehicle didn’t pressure me at all, and Raad doing the financing was pleasant and showed me every step and charge. When I had a concern the next day about the battery, Raad got me into his shop quickly and the mechanic took his time to ensure that I didn’t have any issues. I got the print-out showing everything tested fine. The vehicle is in great condition, a free car fax was offered before purchase, and I left a very happy customer. The other vehicles on the lot were good looking and they have a lot of Toyotas!<//Review>

I want to publicly thank Raad and his staff for an amazing, top notch, and hassle free car buying experience! My wife and I were shopping for a Honda Odyssey Touring, because we needed a vehicle with more room and comfort, and we literally drove by and saw that he had one on the lot and pulled in. Immediately, my family was greeted with a very friendly welcome and we knew that this just might be our last stop. When we met Raad and he found out that we were a military family, he stopped everything that he was doing and he personally showed us around the Odyssey, evaluated our trade (2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SEL), and he offered us an unbelievable deal on our trade and on the Odyssey. We were already financed by USAA and within a short couple hours we were on our way home in a very clean and superb vehicle. It’s been a few months since we made our purchase and we’ve had zero issues. The Odyssey definitely changed how my family commutes and our travels have become much easier. Thank you Raad! I highly recommend this dealership!<//Review>

<text>So far I love my vehicle.  The vehicle was advertised as a 2008 on the window in bold pink numbers.  Or so I thought.   When i got home and thoroughly looked through the paperwork,  the car is a 2006.  I even asked my friend and he also said the vehicle was showcased as a 2008.  Maybe we both thought we saw 2008 on the window.   The manager showed me online a picture of the car and it showed 2006 on the window.   Maybe I was mistaken.  Again,  I love the car so far.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rating>

<Review>I bought my car back in December it was my Christmas Gift from my husband , and I recieved the best customer service. I was really looking forward to getting it , last week my car had issues I contacted the office to discuss about how I can get it fixed. They had no problem with fixing it. They said to bring it into the shop whenever I could. I took it in and they fixed it with no charge, I really recommend this place and from now on all my cars will be bought from this place.
Thanks for great team<//Review>< Pictures>

<time>1585963258433<//time><Review>Their cars are kinda expensive for used ones with high mileage. I have seen other dealers with cheaper used cars. I would not recommend going there..it is so boring..they are boring men to talk to. I will not buy a car from them anymore. The used base models are expensive also where somewhere else you can find trims with upgrades, lower mileage at low prices. I regretted buying a car from them.<//Review>< user_name>

I highly recommend this dealership. Charles was very professional as well as the rest of the staff. Answer all my quickly and honestly even when I called multiple times in one day. Got a great deal on a one owner 05 Toyota. I can honestly  recommend West Coast Auto Sales. Give them a call or stop by great selection of vehicles to choose from</Review>

I like this place.
They have a car collection that fits my personality.
Unique rides for the " I roll in style crowd" and some well loved daily drivers. Several classics too.< /review>

I was approved for a car and had it reserved and told the guy I would talk to him when the weekend was over which was only a few days away, but they sold it anyway!  What a bunch of sleazeballs.
What's the point of reserving a car if you're going to sell it before the date that we agreed to meet up?</text>

Closed a deal on a vehicle a few weeks ago.  They would not negotiate the price, but the vehicle condition was above average.  They have good selection of hard to find vehicles.  Car was clean and in great mechanical condition. DMV paperwork was lighting fast and got pink slip less than 2 weeks after purchase.< /review>

Purchased my 2005 Mitsubishi Outlander here and I couldn't be happier. I emailed the dealership inquiring about the vehicle; I was surprised I got a respond back quick. They suggested I send my credit info through their website, which makes the process easier when I go in to finalize the deal. I did, and in about an hour I got a call back from Moe saying I was approved. He gave me couple of different options over the phone and said we can talk further when we meet. I went down to their location, and I was immediately pleased with the way they served me. From sales to finance, the staff were really nice. The car itself was in such condition I did not see anywhere else. I committed to the vehicle and picked my financing options; the deal all together took less than an hour. I was out of there quick, they made the process easy and pleasing. I would definitely recommend this place. A+< /text>

Great experience went in to ask some questions got the answers that I needed with no pressure to buy.  They were able to get me in a truck no problem even being self employed with no proof of income which other dealers told me otherwise. Would recommend anybody to go look and talk to them.  Nice clean vehicles at reasonable prices.<//review>

They were super friendly, honest and helpful. They got me into the car I wanted and on my way home in no time. My salesman's name was Charlie. One of the most laid back people I've ever purchased anything from. Do not hesitate to check this place out. I love my new Altima!< /Review>

Ask for Eddie.
He was super friendly and had mad patience.
I tested drive the honda 2012 with leather package and it was nice, but turns out my credit did not apply for it.
So, instead of giving up on me, he added me to the lower based model which actually came out cheaper per month.
So least to say, he got me on a great plan monthly thru a local credit company so I was good.
Will sure let everyone know about you guys.
ask for Eddie!<//review>

We bought a Toyota Avalon from these guys. We came in right away when we saw the ad and they gladly walked us through the vehicle inside and out and gave us a comprehensive report of the vehicle history.
The transaction was quick and simple, the vehicle was completely detailed inside and out, and we drove off as happy customers. Highly Recommend!!<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>West Coast Auto Sales Center is a great place to shop for a car. I think the name on its own reminds me of Xzibit from the episodes of Pimp My Ride. However, it's up to the customer on how to hook up your ride. West Coast has a wide selection and a wide range of car sizes and prices. I got my car from here about a week ago for a reasonable price. It was the best purchase I have ever done.

I found their website and quickly browsed through their inventory a few days before visiting the lot. I saw the perfect car for me. I knew this could also be what someone else would buy, so I acted fast and went to West Coast on my bicycle. The folks there are super nice and friendly. They made the paperwork and the entire process of buying a car painless and clear. They showed me the carfax and I felt that it was an excellent deal.

I felt valued and they even let me take the car for a test drive. I came back from the test drive feeling comfortable to make the purchase. It was an incredible experience. I totally recommend you all get your next car at West Coast. I drove out of the lot with a new car and my bike on the trunk/back seats. If a family member needed a car to buy, I would take them here at West Coast Auto.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x809ad98cbfc6b6fd:0x575460cf8ce3eb6a< /gmapID></record>

<Review>This place is a joke. Called to inquire about test driving a vehicle and was told that I would only be able to test drive it if I was making a purchase. TF? How am I supposed to know if I want a car if I haven't test driven it? Hmmm... seems fishy to me.

I seen an Ad on CarGurus for a car that looked to good to be true. It looked immaculate, reasonably priced and low miles. I called and spoke with Radd who was extremely helpful so I drove to Sacramento to see the car and it was everything that was advertised! All of their cars are immaculate ! Radd and his brother Sam were very professional, friendly, and helpful; and I was able to drive off in my new car! I definitely will be back to purchase future vehicles from them !< /review>

Is the dealer honest and helpful ?  Am i buying a excellent quality car ?
Well, I can say, having bought my second Mercedes from Raad and his staff at West Coast Auto Sales..... The answer is an absolute yes !!!!
West Coast have a fantastic inventory of cars, the new dealership is so comfortable to shop at
The buying experience, sooooooo pleasant !!!
If you are looking for a car dealer that will take excellent care of you when you buy and after care....Then West Coast Auto Sales is the place to go !!!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I recently stumbled upon V’s Barbershop while out on an errand. I was curious and googled them this morning. Their website pulled up, I booked an appointment on my lunch with David which was extremely simple.

I was greeted promptly at 1pm by David and told him what I wanted to do with my hair. He was friendly, efficient, and great at cutting hair. I recommend David to anyone. I have found my new barber!</Text>

Chon was amazing. I am new to the area and needed a place to get my haircut and beard trimmed. Found V’s on Google and made an appointment. It’s nice that it’s just down the street from my house. I will be a regular from now on!</review>

First time going to V’s and I will definitely go again! I had a great haircut and an excellent shave. I was the last appointment of the day and I appreciated them getting me in. Despite being the last appointment and being there near closing time Dominique took her time and was very detailed. I highly recommend, everybody was super friendly including the nice gentleman who booked my appointment.< /Review>

It's almost like a spa for dudes, which seems a bit weird but it's actually a throwback vibe to an earlier era where guys had shaves with blades and sat in awesome chairs.

I've used Chon and David at V's.  I've been to David twice now. He does a solid job.  Good enough that I came back a second time.
I recommend this shop and the barbers who work there. Clean and professional.  I'll keep coming back and giving them my money - the highest compliment I can give.</Review>

<review>I finally feel like I found someone I can trust to cut my hair the way I want it done. Brennan is awesome. He's easy going and very professional. I'm leaving the area so my future haircuts are going to be expensive. I'll have to fly down to get it done. Thanks Brennan and V's. I will honestly miss it.< /review>< Pictures>

V's Talega is everything you want in a barbershop.  They keep to the schedule.  The place is always immaculately clean.  Chon gives me a wonderful haircut....and can talk baseball and tell good jokes.  What else is there?!?!?</Review>

One of the best haircuts I've had. I love the shops down on El Camino Real in downtown SC and have been going to many of them since I was a young child, but V's was a completely different experience. If you are looking for something new and refreshing check out V's! Also they offer you great drinks based off your age ;)</text>

The reviews here are a prime example of only negative experiences getting reviews. The wait is long and the place is packed because they do a great job 99% of the time. You can't please everyone!  As for value, $28 + tip gets you a haircut, a neck shave, a "massage", and a beer if you want one. I would recommend V's to anybody.<//review>

I’ve had lots of great experiences with pretty much everyone that works here until my most recent visit. I had Johnny for the first time and told him I wanted the sides and back of my head a 3 and he hastily cut it, missed several rather large pieces of hair, and also shaved way too much hair off from behind my right ear so it’s noticeably uneven. Very disappointed, but everyone else that works here is much better.< /Review>

<text>So, I had come in here a few times in the past, it's a great looking shop and they give you a free beer so what's not to like, right?  I never think to make an appointment, so I'd just go with whoever was available and this was fine until I got a haircut from this guy, Johnny.  It was ok, nothing special, but felt choppy and he acted spacey with me.  I thought, no sweat, just an off-day for the guy.  But the next time in I thought to make an appointment with someone else so I wouldn't get him and when I walked in, bam he says the appointment is with him and parks me in his chair.  Now, I know this isn't right and tell him my appointment is with one of the lady barbers (didn't remember her name), but he starts arguing with me and then when the lady I booked with came over to see what was up he starts getting into it with her.  I’ve never seen anything like this in a business and it made everybody in the place uncomfortable.  I decided that was the last time for V's - this dude, Johnny, was wrecking the place for me.  I was going to post a bad review to warn people away but forgot.

Jump ahead a few months and I decided to try V’s again since the place itself is so cool.  Guess what, that fool, Johnny got himself fired!  I am not surprised and when I was talking with other guys in the shop, I found out it was way overdue and he’s been using and abusing for a long time (if you know what I mean).

Anyway, I got a great cut from Dave while downing a sweet IPA and I gotta say the vibe in the shop was super cool.  I am definitely coming back, I’m so glad I gave them another try.  These guys are the best now!</text></record>

I always get my haircut with Brennan. He is consistent and does exactly what i want without me having to remind him of details. He makes V's Barbershop in San  Clemente a place where customers experience the "American barbershop tradition".

This place seems like one which relies off of the atmosphere and overall vibe rather than what they actually provide. I had a friendly greeting when I walked in and sat down immediately. The haircut was decent, not the best I've had, but not bad. I got a short 2 minute massage with a hand vibrating tool and that was that. The problem I had was that they simply went through my cut as fast as they could with noone else waiting and it was very expensive without anyone ever telling me the price or me seeing anything posted. I could have gone to Sport Clips and gotten just as good of a cut with a hair wash and full massage shave and everything for less than what just one cut cost me here. I prefer to support a local barber shop though so next time I will save a few bucks and go somewhere else. Just simply not worth $30 for a standard haircut< /text>

Went in for a haircut and beard trim/lineup. The "master barber" who has been cutting hair since 1960 did not know how to use a straight razor whatsoever. After a miserable attempt to line up one side of my beard, I had to directly show him what it means to get a line up. After struggling to do one side, he goes to do the other, and when I look in the mirror, the two sides are so uneven it's painful. He wouldn't have even noticed it or said anything if I didn't bluntly point out this horrible job. This experience is especially disappointing because I came in as a first time customer, told them I had a photo shoot the next day so the details had to be right, paid a whopping $43 for a lousy haircut (I normally pay $30 w/tip at senor barbers, and they always get it spot on). On top of that, my barber was not warm and friendly, he made zero effort to make this a good experience for me. After all this, I jumped out of my seat and went to another barbershop to remedy the mistakes they made.

If you want a proper haircutting experience, attention to detail, and a staff that truly cares for their clients and their business, go elsewhere. 0/10 for me.<//review>

We asked for a slight trim, medium  short and now I have a full buzzcut. The barber at the beggening of the hair cut even said "ok so onlly about this much off", and showed maby and inch! My dad and I have also rarely left this place happy. I don't think I will ever be returning!

visit two: I was in arush to get a hair cut and they were the closest one so I setteld for them. the lady I got barley speaks english, so when I told her about the  the fully healded scar on my head just incase. as she started the hair cut she completly ignored me and shaved to hard there and it opend up. the pain sucked and all she did was put powder on it and did not even apoligize! completly out rages!!!!< /Text>

Barber didn't listen to my instructions. Did the opposite and totally f*ucked up months of time getting it at a length i liked.
It took a shower and a little time to realize how much of A F*UCKING RIP OFF this place is.
The marine core barbershops at $10 are better.... $25 is a gawddam joke.<//Text>

I took my son in and the woman who gave the haircut was very rude, as if she had better things to do.  She was distracted by a text, rough in handling my sons head, didn't offer to style his hair, didn't wipe off the excess hair from his neck and shirt and when I paid didn't look me in the eye and was very abrupt.  I'm very disappointed and will take my business elsewhere.</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

They also have banana split, root beer floats, cookies... Not sure if they have regular ice cream. I had the momma Apple pie low sugar frozen yogurt(13 grams for 4oz) it was amazing. Wish they had more options for people watching sugar. My friend had the mango gelato and he said it was delish. Overall it was nice. Good dessert, clean, kind of friendly cashier. I'll definitely go back.
They have great deals a few days of the week. Sunday, Monday and Tuesday I remember, not sure about rest of the week.< /Text><Date>1488637863158< /Date>< response>

<Review>Always gone here since they've opened and have always been happy with what they offer. However, I think it would be nice if there was more than one non-dairy yogurt flavor, since, as a vegan, it limits what chooses I have. (I will say that the past non-dairy flavors have been great, just would appreciate more of them).<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1539291863659, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback!

Fifth time I have taken my family here and it just keeps getting worse. I think they don't train employees. Shave ice is important to me, it's my favorite. But I literally threw out more than half of one today. I told them their lime had turned last time that was a year ago and it is still gross like mold. They say they have coconut but they haven't the last three times. I live close, if it was half decent I'd be there weekly. It was an ice brick with old syrup. Gross.</Text>

The yogurt is always good here but tonight I was treated very poorly. I had gastric bypass and not everything sets well on my stomach anymore and tonight I was craving some frozen yogurt. I stopped in and asked to try 3 flavors and the young lady snapped at me stating “your only allowed two, that’s it!” I attempted to explain why I would like the other sample and she refused. I told her I did not like the two flavors I tried, could I please try the third one. She let out a deep sigh and walked away. I told her I understood why they probably had to put the two sample rule in place but I can assure her I would buy something I just wanted to make sure the flavor was going to set on my stomach. She seemed very frustrated for me to even be in the store. She tossed the sample cup on the counter and walked away again. I understand it’s getting closer to closing time and she is starting to clean up, but still no excuse for rudeness! I’m a very polite person and attempted to explain why I asked for one more sample, which ended up being the flavor I got. There were 5 more flavors I could have asked to try but didn’t. I get we all have bad days and she was following what the was instructed in certain , but once again there is not excuse for rudeness! I will not be coming back here again.... even if it’s the only yogurt shop close to my house!! Sorry crazy yogurt but you just lost a customer!<//Text>

Again, we apologize that your visit was less than exemplary as that is never our goal. When we first responded we had yet to speak with our employees, however, after hearing their side of the story it seems more likely that there was a misunderstanding than poor customer service on our part.\n\nI was honestly shocked by your account of what had occurred because I do not believe any member of our staff would blatantly ignore our customers or prioritize socializing so I went in to the store immediately after you posted your review and addressed the situation post haste. For one, I just wanted to clarify that the "friend" our employee was talking to was actually another one of our employees. The second misunderstanding was that when she stated that one of the samples was not available, she said that she explained it was because a flavor change was just performed which means we ran out of one flavor and had to clean, sanitize, and restart the machine with new product. While unfortunate, we cannot predict when this will happen and it does take some time to complete. She mentioned that because it was just changed, it was not quite ready to be served but that she would be able to get you a sample once it was ready which I believe is why there was no urgency to retrieve the sample.\n\nAs mentioned in our previous reply, there is a BOGO available for you on your next visit which is still valid. We just wanted to share our side because every little review can help or hurt our business and a small misunderstanding can make the difference in us keeping the doors open or closing down. We really hope our customers can understand that we do not train our employees to do a terrible job or give bad service but that we are all human and sometimes honest mistakes or miscommunication can happen.\n\nThanks again for leaving a review, we hope we can turn it around on your next visit!'}</response>< Date>

<text>I would normally give a 5 star review because I love this place and our family has been going for a long time. We came into the shop tonight for a yogurt and I was thrown back by the service we got. When we first walked in we were not acknowledged for a minute because the worker was to busy talking to her friends. After standing there waiting I was rudely asked "what can I do for you". I asked for sample cups and did not know there wasnt samples anymore. I had to get a sample from the worker and one of the samples was not available. I was informed that she would have to get some but instead of helping us she went back to talking to her friends. I am very disappointed and wouldn't of even bothered buying a yogurt tonight if my son wasnt already excited about getting one. I understand not having sample cups anymore but if this new system is going to work than you have to have employees willing to help there customers.<//text>< name>

The sign on the door says they're open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Sundays, and online says they're open until 10 p.m. . Yet when I went in at 9:16, they told me they were closed and then lock the door after I left, even after I told them their sign says they are open until 10 p.m. normally I love this yogurt shop, but I was very disappointed in the staff that was working<//text>

They were within my price range. Just don’t like how I have to leave my car over night every single time I bring my car for a repair but they are very nice and understanding people. I will recommend this place to many people but for those who use their car everyday for work and need it 247, then I wouldnt recommend this place. But other than leaving the car over night I love this place. I absolutely trust this place with my car. Thank you<//text>

Love this place fair and thorough! I came here a few times twice they didn't even charge me once my right fender came apart backing off a driveway. And my security went bonkers and kept going off I was pleasantly surprized never has anyone not only taken the time to help me but because for them it was minor enough not to charge me they put new clips on the front of my car, so happy with this place and yes i have had my brakes done here and paid for their service of course! just saying they are good people. They go above and beyond then what most would even consider doing. Thank you M STAR</Review>

Service is awesome here, and by that I mean honest and genuine, they take responsibility for their work, are fair and give the best deals for what you are trying to get done.

I had vibrations in acceleration on my minivan's steering wheel and drivers side for a while, and after changing a whole new set of tires and also get alignment done, it didn't go away. After asking 4 different places I decided to go with M STAR, since my mother-in-law had taken the van in before, they said they would waive the $100 inspection fee. (It's higher than a small shop in Alhambra but cheaper than toyota dealer for sure). So now it's free, I'm happy, I take it in and they tell me a few hours later that the 2 axles are unbalanced and they'll need to replace. Turns out it's $900/ea original retail price, but they have OEM w labor&tax $320/ea. Ok, this is big drop for me, but I know it's really important as my wife and I share the same vehicle and we both did not like how dangerous the car felt w the vibrations. So I went ahead to confirm it,

When I arrived to pick up the car, get this:
They said before they changed these axles out for my mother in law so this is the part's fault and it's on them,
- they are waiving the labor fees,
- crediting me the full amount I paid last time (showed me the receipt from last time),
- sending the fairy new axles in for warranty replacements (showed me pictures they took of the parts and the work)
- and all I have to pay for is the difference between the new and better quality axles they put in today and the alignment. Ends up being $230! I'm very happy they were so honest and responsible and good business practice.

This place is legit. The people are good. I have written my fair share of reviews on shady and evil auto shops who swindle you or unsuspecting, especially since we didn't know. They could've kept the work from last time from me, I wouldn't have known. But they chose to be honest and genuine, and you CANT ask any more from an auto shop!!

Highly recommend!!< /text>

< review>
(Translated by Google) Recommended by friends, come here for maintenance, the experience is not too pleasant! Just check it and receive $ 55, including discounts! Nothing was found out! Just deal with customers! Mac's service attitude is still good! But the master is too careless! Afterwards, it was found that the roses in the engine cover were not aligned, and the wires for detecting the fault code were not reset! This returns the car to the customer. It is really worrying. The scale is not small, the fees are not cheap, and the service skills need to be improved! Not afraid to go again in the short term, not very relieved!

(Original)
经朋友推荐，来这里检修，经历不是太愉快！简单检查一下，就收了55刀，己包含折扣！什么也没有查出来！只是应付一下客户！Mac 的服务态度还是不错！但师傅做事太过马虎！事后发现，发动机盖的罗丝都没有上齐，检测故障码的电线也没有复位！这样就将车交还客户。实在令人担忧。规模不小，收费不便宜，服务技能有待改进！短期内不敢再去，不是很放心！</review>

(Translated by Google) The owner of this store is not honest at all, it is not real, the technology is not good, and the service attitude is very poor.

Moved. No update as to where. No answer for phone number. Sign on door of posted location says it moved back in 2017. 2 years is more than adequate time to update address and keep poor people from wasting gas they CANNOT AFFORD TO WASTE.</text>

The Blessing Center is a blessing to those who are struggling to put food on the table.  They give you a box of food, including meat, bread and milk. If you need clothes you can get some from the clothing pantry. The staff are very loving and courteous.  Some of the people who go there can be rude and self absorbed.  They pray every time before handing out the food.</text>

<Text>Well placed restaurant with some delicious fish served with tasty and fresh vegetables. Recommended the zucchini noodles with the seasoned tuna. No need for fancy dressings, the bowl will taste good with some soy sauce and little else.

<text>Reading from all the other great reviews gave me high expectations, so I decided to stop by and give it a try. For its price I really thought it was more like average compared to South Bay. The scoop was smaller than Poke House I believe,  so it was a bit disappointing.

The staff is quite friendly.< /text><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808fe9bd25494aff:0x6d4a154747a981f1</GmapID><user_name>Ellie L.< /user_name>< Pics>

Love this place. Best one in the area in my opinion. Fresh, flavorful and great portions. Only poke place around I know of that has scallops. They also offer a lot of gluten free options (minus one start because I did have to train them once or twice on something that was being advertised as gluten free, but really wasn't - they fixed it right away).</review>

<Review>Might not be the traditionalists cup of tea but a good selection of poke. Fresh tasty and large portions at a resonance price. Staff is friendly and location is clean and bright. So many options executed in an efficient way. Love it have been back many times since I discovered this place. And I never have been a big poke person. Try it you won’t regret the experience.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<review>This is the only poke place I go to in Pleasanton. I have tried others, and each time I've wished that I had just gone to this place. Prime Poke has a good option of fish to choose from, and the sauces are really good. I always order the two protein, because the three is too much for me, and I have always gotten the tuna for the free scoop, the marinated salmon, and the marinated tuna (I dont remember the exact name). For the last meat you order, they let you choose mix ins, I get the cucumber, cilantro, and serrano. Then for sauces my favorite for the mix ins in spicy poke and teriyaki. For the sauces on top, I would recommend sriracha and the spicy mayo, if you like spice, or just the spicy mayo if you want it to be mild. However, even with all that spicy stuff on top, it is not an overpowering amount of spice. I tried for the first a topping, I forget the name but I'll include a picture, and it was a good amount of crisp but the pieces were just a little too large for my taste. If you're in Pleasanton, and feel like poke, I would definitely try this place out!</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUWrYO_PxoZQLuX1RvS7IhwiCpqqzjb-B7IpeY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Good place for a poke bowl. Lots of good variety and good portions. When I went, the rice was a little bit wetter than I'd like. They were also giving out a free scoop of either spicy tuna or crab salad which was delicious.<//Text>

This place used to be a real gem, but they've raised their prices, and really control their portion sizes now...it's just ok now. I don't come here nearly as often as I used to.</text>

<review>My service advisor, Andy, was courteous and professional.  The service area was busy, but my oil change took just less than an hour.   Also, the lounge waiting area was comfortable.  I will definitely continue to get my service work done at this location.< /review>< pics>

Wonderful customer service from Derek Cornell. I was looking at two vehicles online, requested information and he responded quickly and efficiently. Went above and beyond to explain details and answered all questions I had. Saw me the very next day in store and had both vehicles ready to show. He’s extremely knowledgeable in his area and knew all aspects of both vehicles. From start to finish, it was a easy, smooth purchase. Will be recommending his service to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle online or in store. All the staff was helpful and made my first car purchase a memorable one.</text>

This review is a about the service I've been having at mossy Nissan.  Great place to service your car or any car.  I've always had great experience especially with my service advisor Matt. He's always been going above and beyond to make sure that I'm satisfied with the service and the condition of my car after It had been returned to me.  Thank you mossy Nissan and Matt for taking great care of my car and a timely matter every single time.< /text>

The dealership is clean, spacious and comfortable. We ended up loving the car & decides to pull the trigger. The staff is very easy to deal with and professional. Our sales person is so helpful, and we like that he is not pushy. I would say that me and my husband have an excellent experience overall.<//review>

I just bought a new car here and the experience went great. I went to 4 other dealerships before this one and all of them were horrible. Cory, the sales manager, and Manny, the financer both were fantastic. Very friendly and helpful. Neither of them were pushy, tried to get me to stay, or tried changing numbers at the end. I would definitely recommend going here for a stress free car buying experience.< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><review>I went just to look. And with Corey’s enthusiasm and suave I was hooked on the dealership and the car. I’ve always been a mossy fan and Nissan has been in the family since I was born. But Corey brought out my own love and appreciation for the company and brand. To see the effort someone will go through not for a sale but for my comfort and experience shows me that this is a place I can trust. Corey at Mossy Nissan In El Cajon is doing it right and made buying my first car an amazing experience.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1613066111938, 'text': 'Hi Giovanni, thank you for taking the time to review your recent visit!

<Time>1613090856584<//Time><rating>5</rating><Review>I really appreciate Cory's assistance. He has helped with every car I have leased. This will be my 3rd car and this time he walked me through appropriate steps to finance with the help of Travis and Marc. I am truly grateful for the patience he has shown throughout the years.. He walks me through all the features and gets me all set up before I pull out of the lot... and it doesn't stop there. He has been available to answer any question and assist in anyway possible everytime I've called in the past 6 years. Kindness really does go a long way. Thank you Mossy Nissan El Cajon, Cory is a gem.<//Review>< Pictures>

I had a great experience. Sarah is very knowledgeable and helped me out with checking my tires to recommend a tire rotation. Which she had done for me the same day! The service was fairly quick and friendly. Will return for my next service to this dealership.</Review>

Oscar Araiza went above and beyond to help myself and my wife get both of our 2016 Nissans (which we bought there at Mossy El Cajon) serviced on what seemed like a busy day.  Oscar never let on that anything about squeezing in my wife’s unscheduled service was a challenge.  He was cool and smooth as ice cream.<//text>

We were met with a smile as soon as we walked in and out experience continued to be great! Gabriel was so helpful, answered all of our questions and we felt at ease through the entire process. It was refreshing to be able to shop for a car without feeling pressured or pushed and to actually have someone really listen to you!<//text>

Called to schedule an appointment and the gentleman told me no problem and had me in a couple hours later. This being my first Nissan I had a question regarding oil maintenance and the gentleman on the phone was very confused about what I was asking so I told him not to worry about it and I’d follow up when I showed up.
Showed up for my appointment and the gentleman taking care of me went on and on about how he had 25 other cars and they were closing at 4 and he would “do what he could, no promises” I said ok not a problem…..he seemed very stressed out because as he continued with whatever computer work he was doing he continued to tell me how backed up they were and he would do what he could. I said no worries, at the end of the day we can just reschedule right? He said we could but he would do his best, again…..no promises.
Just kept thinking why would I be scheduled so quickly if this guy was this backed up? Wondered how the appointments are scheduled and if they’re communicating effectively with each other.
As I walked out I remembered my service question so I asked the gentleman my question and he gave me a very quick response. I said ok only reason I’m asking is because I saw on the Nissan website this info here, without looking at what I was showing him he said no it’s this. I said ok well maybe you should talk to the big boys upstairs because others may not have the luxury of talking to you and could possibly damage their vehicles going off what Nissan recommends.
My service was done in about an hour or so, which made me wonder what all the hooplah was about being so backed up.
Next time around I may try the National city location to see if I fare a little better. Kind of felt like a bit of a bother and when dealing with questions the guy was a little condescending.< /text>

Manny Jurado (Sales Manager), Gabe Sellers (Product Consultant) and Sarah Tapia (Service Advisor), I can't thank them enough. I am excited with my new purchase and I am pleased on how well these three individuals take care of me and my cars needs. I've had my share of bad experiences and that has all been over ruled with the welcoming service Sarah provides me, the patience and understanding Gabe Sellers provided me in sales (I'm not the easiest to work with), and the environment full of laughter Manny provided when I signed my documents. I highly recommend Gabe when looking for a new car, Manny for the best deals on warranties and Sarah for any return trip needed for servicing your Nissan.<//text>

<Review>UPDATE Monday April 26, 2021

I was promised a refund for this "maintenance" package. I have called several times and left message still not respond. Today I called and was hung up on. Shame on you Mossy Nissan for these deplorable, dishonest practices of ripping off veterans.

Veterans beware! I purchased a vehicle from here back in January. At purchase a fast talking finance guy name Manny talked me into buy some top of the line package where I don't pay for maintenancefor the life of the vehicle.  Manny said "oh this covers belts and hoses for life any maintenance issue you take the car to any Nissan dealership nationwide and the vehicle will be fixed for free".  Fast forward I bring the car in for the service and find out I was scammed. There is no such package. MOSSY NISSAN SCAMS VETERANS AND DOESN'T HONOR THEIR WORD.< /Review>< pics>

<text>I took my car in for its 30K service and a recall. When I booked the service, I was expecting to pay close to what it showed online, which was around $300. Well, I paid $500 in labor, plus around $130 for the parts, etc...the staff is great and it seems like it’s always busy. Luckily they had a rental since the recall was going to take a few hours. I’ll most likely only return for major maintenance due to my warranty.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

We knew we wanted a dependable car that would last us many years so we went to Nissan with a plan to just check it out and maybe one other car dealership. On arrival we were met by David who was friendly and very knowledgeable about any car we pointed to. He would unlock them and let us sit in them. My boyfriend ended up loving a Maxima while I loved one of the Rogues. We had been approved by our credit union but David found us a better deal than we had expected. It was so smooth and surprisingly  fast that I asked about maybe trading in my car. Normally I would never ask, I know car dealerships can low ball you on trade ins but they offered to paid it off and still found me a great apr and monthly payments! We both left with new pre-owned certified cars! I’ve never in my life have had such a great experience buying one car let alone two cars!

<text>I went back in after an associate told me he would price match my oil change because as of 2017 I haven’t been getting it thru Nissan.the last time I had work done it was a hassle and when I got my car back my center light in my car fell there isn’t glue or anything else holding it up so I’ll have to tape called the Monday after I picked up my car nothing called a few more times nothing... I called months later to make and appointment for my oil change with him... I went in to find out the associate was no longer there ( I spoke to him Friday went in Monday.. I was told they would call me to check warranty on my looking at my light and never heard back from anyone. This location is so bad at calling back I’ve called 2/3 times in a single day and wouldn’t hear back. When you get there everyone is so nice but there’s never any follow thru. I only go here because I live across the street. Every time I’ve taken my car in I always have to call and follow up usually take about 3 calls. Last time they kept my car for over a week with no call back... horrible<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Rate>3<//Rate>< Time>

OUTSTANDING CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE FROM START TO FINISH! I was so close to pulling the trigger and purchasing a car from another dealer, but luckily it didn't work out and I ended up on the lot of Mossy Nissan El Cajon.  I am SO GRATEFUL that I did.  Joe Chavez was the sales associate who helped me and he was the very antithesis of what you expect from a standard "used car salesman." Joe is PATIENT, professional, knowledgeable and honest. He earned my trust and my business for life. He was able to get me my absolute dream car that had he not asked, I don't think I ever would have mentioned because I assumed it was out my budget. But it wasn't. It was an hour before close and you never would have known it, he was taking his time to answer all of my questions (of which I had many) and he made sure I was HAPPY and that it was within my budget. I'm still in awe that I own such a beautiful fully loaded vehicle. I would not have bought this car if it wasn't for Joe. I have to also share that Mark in financing was EQUALLY as EXCEPTIONAL! He was so friendly, and has more than 20 years of experience in the industry and it shows! He was able to finance me at an incredible APR, and keep my payment within my budget even after adding an extended warranty, alarm, and gap insurance (highly recommend all three.) In these unprecedented times, I'm so grateful to have stumbled upon this dealership where their sales and finance teams are people of integrity and professionalism. I can't say enough positive things about this team, and they really did make what could have been a very stressful experience one that was enjoyable and memorable. I'm so happy with everything about this interaction. THANK YOU JOE AND MARK FOR GETTING ME MY DREAM CAR!!!< /review>

I brought my car in to take care of a coolant smell & to get an oil change & check up.  I received great customer service and received my vehicle back in with no coolant smell in a timely manner.</Review>

<review>Elijah, Sarah and almost everyone I've done business with at this Mossy Nissan (El Cajon), has always been very professional compassionate and genuinely lovely.  Today's visit was no different.  In this COVID-19 era, they're doing things right, following all pandemic protocol, and still offering top-notch service in a calm, clean and friendly atmosphere.  Great job!</review>< Pictures>

My service was good however I thought that some of the charges were way over priced such as $30 to clean my battery terminals and put pads under them. My wife was the one who answered the phone and approved the work had it been me I would have not had that done. I will be back for warranty work but most likely not much else.

Had a great experience at the service center. I felt I would get the best care for my Nissan Xterra at a dealership and my hopes were not disappointed. Elijah is very customer service oriented I would come back just for his service. The car is running great and I can't ask for anything more. Thank You.</text>

< Review>
I bought a new Frontier from the dealership on 12/27/2020. The sales guy insisted that I take procession of the truck and promised that the alarm will be activated at my place of business and he personally will fix a little issue with the trim.
All BS!
Two days later I had to take the truck in to the shop to complete the setup.
What a waste of time! My time, of course.
The truck and the service guys are great.
Beware of the sales guys! They are pushy and manipulative. No integrity!

Mossy of El Cajon has a reputable team, Mossy of Escondido lied to me and told me they have a truck that the Salesman at Mossy of El Cajon clearly had in his possession, the Mossy of Escondido team even let me speak to his Manager Anthony who claimed the same thing.  The Mossy of Escondido team even sent an MSRP saying that truck was on their lot, but it was not...It was in Joe's possession at Mossy of El Cajon major difference between the two dealerships.<//review>

My interaction with Elijah Alvarez was above and beyond.  He explained everything to be done then went over it all when near completion.  We talked about our families, my trip I was going on and made it a calming and appreciative visit. Great customer service is certainly what a person wants when they come in, for whatever reason. I give huge cudos to Elijah. He is indeed a great representative for Nissan, El Cajon.<//review>

This dealership has no loyalty to their potential customers. Im in the market for a potential work vehicle and signed up for a test drive. At the time they were running a promotion to where you are given a code for a $50 Amazon gift card that they have to validate when you test drive a new car. i did just that, their rep CORY GRUBA insisted that he would email the validated code right away and that it would be in my email...nothing. I texted him to question what had happened and he said that the code had already been redeemed the day that i registered, i did the test drive a few days later. So not only did he not email me but he made no efforts to resolve the problem.This dealership is deceiving. DO NOT TRUST CORY GRUBA OR THE GENERAL MANAGER TRAVIS.
I have a SUBARU and they are fantastic cars.</Text>

This review is a about the service I've been having at mossy Nissan.  Great place to service your car or any car.  I've always had great experience especially with my service advisor Matt. He's always been going above and beyond to make sure that I'm satisfied with the service and the condition of my car after It had been returned to me.  Thank you mossy Nissan and Matt for taking great care of my car and a timely matter every single time.<//review>

I had to go there to the service department and it was a pleasant experience . Everyone was very nice and accommodating.  Joshua was very helpful.  I  thought I had another  problem  I had to go back for but it turned out to be a loose connection  which was causing the check engine light to come on. I liked how we were so taken care of by Joshua  and he had given me his card with his direct number and told me if there was anything else in the future we needed we should call him. So that's what I did .I was told he and everyone else was very busy that day . So I left my number. He was very  prompt and called me back . While we  were waiting  that day we took a walk to look around at the cars on the lot and we spoke to a salesman who was very knowledgeable  and I look forward to doing business with him when the time comes for either a trade in or finance another vehicle.  Overall we had a good feeling about returning to Mossy Nissan . This is the result of what good customer  service  will do . This is how customers want to be treated so they will return and continue to spread the word to friends and family.  Good job Mossy Nissan and also Joshua .<//text>

Sarah Tapia is the best service specialist! She always makes sure my questions are answered and that I am kept informed about how things are progressing with my car while it is being repaired. Due to her professionalism and friendly demeanor I have returned each time I have needed a repair and specifically asked for Sarah. Any time someone needs a referral for services I refer them to Mossy Nissan and I tell them to contact Sarah.<//review>

I inquired first via their webpage about a car, they were very fast and prompt to answer all my questions, always very polite and professional, follow up frequently, and when we went in person it was also a very pleasant experience, no hassle no stress, totally enjoyed the process and would buy another car from them again in the future. This is our first Nissan car at home, it will not be the last, more to come!!  IF YOU GO, ASK FOR JOE!< /review>

<Review>I'm behind annoyed with Nissan at this time. Obvious manufacturing defects in the paint they refuse to fix (this will cost me under $1.2k, think of how little it would cost you) and an obviously well known CVT issue that can't be fixed because even though my car wouldn't accelerate, they found no error codes. I can't wait to get rid of this car.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1603227349525, 'text': 'Hi Jennifer, we regret that you were unsatisfied with your vehicle.

My service advisor did an awesome job & I like the fact that he handled more things for me and I just pay them instead of having to wait in line. The advisor new what service I needed & provided prompt courteous service. Was disappointed that my van was not washed but its understandable with what's going on.Thanks so much.</Text>

Mossy Nissan El Cajon has been MY choice for all my car needs for the past 5 years, and this purchase has been my 3rd new car during that time. Mossy Nissan El Cajon, always seems to be able to continue to raise the bar and provide an incredibly amazing experience every time, across the board; Marco in Finance, Gary Craig in Sales, and Sarah Tapia in Service, and everyone behind the scenes. Thank you!</review>

My most recent experience was an oil change in the service department during our ‘quarantined’ season. Johnny was a great help and I dropped my car and keys off safety and then returned when they called. It was timely considering the circumstances and I appreciate them caring well for me and my belongings.</Review>

Marcus was the sales representative, he told us that was our final price and we denied the extended warranty he offered. My daughter went inside to sign paperwork while I was watching her baby outside. My grandson.  Once done, I reviewed the contact at a glance and noticed they changed 18,900 for the vehicle, i asked her to go find out why and the dealer started if I didn't finance through nissan we didn't get the sale price but they didn't disclose that information at all.  When we got home I looked closer at the contact and they added the extra warranty which we had declined.  I emailed the managerTanya and called Michael but yet got a call back.  Be very careful if buying a vehicle, unsatisfactory communication.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Ms. Tapia in El Cajon was very helpful and attentive to my problem.  Expected repairs on a difficult to reach drive belt to cost more, but was happily surprised with their very reasonable charge.  Added appreciation for the complimentary car wash.</text>

I made an appointment with Derek on Friday, to be there on Saturday @ 9:00 am.
On Saturday Morning, i arrived on time, upon my entrance i was greeted my staff, and I continue to ask for Derek, they informed me when was not there but would arrive at 9:30 am. I informed the person whom i was speaking with that i did not want to wait until 9:30 and was open to speaking with anyone. At the moment Joe came to our rescue, they already had my pre application on file, which i had applied for the previous day, I Already knew the vehicle that i wanted, so it was just all about getting approved. Let me tell you, Joe pulled a bunny out of his hat and made it happen for me, i was like a drive thru he was so helpful! Explained everything to the point about the vehicle was very patient and answered all my questions, before i drove away. He even set up my Bluetooth. Going to tell all my friends, co-workers and relatives "if you go to go Nissan in El Cajon ask for Joe Chavez" =-)<//text>

I had purchased my first Nissan Frontier last year up in Oceanside at Mossy Nissan.    Since that time,  I have had some questions about the car's performance and behaviors.    My first contact with Mossy Nissan of Kearny Mesa was a nightmare.   When I got the chance to speak with a representative from their service department, the help was so rude, I simply walked away.  I will never return.    I finally optioned calling Mossy Nissan of El Cajon.     While there,  Johnny Frank handled my service.   I cannot speak enough to his knowledge and personable approach.    I just needed an oil change, and to ask some maintenance questions about the car.   Johnny was great!!!   He answered all the questions about my car, but more importantly,   he was honest and he was nice.    I felt comfortable speaking with him about the car and the maintenance associated with it and did not feel like I was being up-sold or placated as consumer.   By virtue of his professional disposition and honesty,  I will be returning for all service matters associated with the truck.    Please thank him for me.  I feel so much better about owning and maintaining this truck!!</text>

I took the car back in and asked the Service Manager if the underling cause of rattling in the car was believed to be due to a mistake from a Mossy employee during servicing if I'd have to pay the $150 inspection fee. The Service Manager said yes that is their policy. I asked him a few more questions, because that just doesn’t make sense to me, then I left.

I see that as a policy that dodges accountability. I see that as a policy that could create loopholes for service departments to initiate small issues in vehicles so that customers will come back in and charge them for the inspection (even if It was their fault) and additional required work on the vehicle.

Been doing business here for over two years but not anymore now that I know that is the policy. I’ll go somewhere that’ll actually take a look and own it if they made a mistake, not charge me for it. Zero accountability = zero trust.

I worked with Johnny F. on both occasions. If the information I received was incorrect or if you could help me better understand that policy, reach out. He has my contact info.< /Review>< pics>

The car was taken in due to a recall notice for defective airbags.  I made the appointment, showed up on time, and was given an estimated time of completion.  The repairs were made within two hours; I was called and picked up the car immediately.  The service people were courteous and professional.  They adhered to all of the safety regulations required due to COVID-19.  It was a good experience.</review>

When I got there everything went well, but when I paid I noticed it was too cheap for all the services I wanted. The advisor told me that they were close to closing and they only did the oil change, even though I left my car there since 2pm. I told him that I had requested all the services above when I made the appointment and that I was not a “walk-in” customer. He still said they were about to close and told me my total. I didn’t want to argue so I paid and left but I was disappointed, if I just wanted oil changes then I would walk-in instead of making an appointment.<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
First time buying an “adult” car and it couldn’t have been better ! We went to 9 dealerships before coming here and we got Tony from a recommendation from a friend that works there and he could not have been better ! If you’re looking for a new car that’s is a decent price , come here and see Tony ! He really listened to what i wanted and he delivered and even helped me to find a good rate on car insurance. He goes above and beyond. The entire staff was great even the manager Manny. Had a great first car shopping and financing  experience !< /Review>

I travel to this location for service because this team is always really nice. The dont push unneeded service. Other Nissan dealers, including other Mossy, are rude and pushy. You may get a free Danish at another shop but you wont be treated as well.< /text></record>

You did awesome and went above and beyond to make it happen and considered everything I was looking for. Definately listened to what I had to say and what I wanted and they did not just try to get me into whatever was convenient for them.  Really recommend, very smooth service and transaction overall.

I appreciate everyone who works there. They all treat you like family and don't have limits towards helping you out.

Gary, the salesperson I worked with, was very low pressure, which was awesome for me. He was very knowledgeable  about  the different models of cars I was interested in, and the features that each one had.  People  in other departments worked with him to make buying my car a simple and stress-free experience. Even when we inadvertently kept them past closing,  everyone was still polite and efficient.  I would definitely go there again for another car !</text>

Mr. Fisher went above and beyond to make my service fast and done correctly. He even went so far as to wash off my truck and vacuum my interior when all I was there for was an oil change! Very happy with my trip there.< /Text>

I purchased a 2017 Nissan Titan from these folks.  Able (my salesperson) was 1000% amazing.  He was able to make the deal happen at my terms.  I am not an easy person to deal with either.  I can't express enough how amazing my experience was Mossy in El Cajon.  I am definitely going to purchase another vehicle from Able soon.  I finally found a place that wants to work with me and make it a great experience.  Highly recommended!< /Text>

He took the time to answer all of our questions prior to coming in, despite our calling him multiple times.

<text>Fours Nissans later, a Titan, a Frontier and two Altimas we are still very happy with Nissan. We could not be happier with the service we receive either.

Gabe is Sales knows exactly what we want and finds it when it is time. No hassles, just straight forward and knowledgeable. If he does not know the answer to my question he will find it fast.

Elija (Check spelling) Runs a great service department and actually cares about his customers.

Sara is our go to in the service department and is just awesome. So much in fact that I now send our chevy sales fleet SUV's to her for service. You are not going to find her trying to sell you services you don't need.

I had to send send both trucks to the body shop, one for an accident, the other for a factory defect. Although it takes such a long time for them to get your vehicle back, the work is great!

Class act from Sales all the way to Management. We will be Nissan fans for some time if this level of service continues to impress.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Khar was prompt, friendly and assured me that he would have the vehicle inspected to make sure items weren't replaced (i.e. cabin and air filters),just because it's on the 75k service listing.

Charlie was extremely helpful & I’m so happy to have had him as my rep! I went in with an idea of what I wanted and he guided me to the perfect car! He was patient, answered all my questions and was very knowledgeable. I got a Nissan Rogue Sport 2017. We went out on a test drive and he explained everything about the car in detail and clarified any concerns I had. Definitely did not pressure me into something I didn’t want. So happy with Charlie’s customer service & my new car!</review>

<Review>I went to Mossy to test drive a Kicks and ended up purchasing it that night.  My salesman Joe Chavez never at any time put pressure on me to buy the car.  He was very professional and patient during the entire process.  I highly recommend this dealer as well as Joe himself.  It has been a long time since I shopped for a car and the process does take a long time.  Joe and the manager did all they could to streamline the process and get the job done.</Review>< name>

I was recently a first time customer at your service center. I was impressed with the courtesy and professionalism of the staff. I even enjoyed my conversation with the shuttle driver that gave me a ride home. He really loves his job and said Mossy Nissan El Cajon treats him and all of their employees like family. Maybe that's one of the reasons for the superior service. I want to give a shout out and thanks to your service writer Steven Lopez. Steven took the time to listen to me and just didn't take my keys and write up a service ticket. And, if you are smart, you will never let your detail "artist" John leave your facility. My car never looked so good after he performed his magic.<//Text>

I am very pleased that Mossy's service department was able to take care of my problem
as quickly and efficiently as they did! I did not have an apt but they were able to help me right away.  The service advisor (Johnny Frank) does a great job for them.  Competent technicians complemented by other efficient personnel makes a great Service Department.

Below par experience. Bought a brand new Nissan NV200 and the experience has not been great. The van itself runs great but was sold with numerous dings and scratches that they will "take care of"... still hasn't been scheduled or anything. Was told to come back to install the overpriced alarm system which scheduling that was a nightmare. Not to mention it took all day to complete when we were promised it was quick. They utilize another company to install shelving and patrician boards which was another nightmare to deal with. Cheap products, overpriced installation and horrible quality of work combined with another 6.5 hour delay to install. This experience has caused my business hardship due to poor management by Nissan and its vendors. Due your research before dealing with this place<//review>

It's all to Josh, the maintenance rep who took care of me.  I called in at 1330 for a 1400 appt.  Met Josh at 1350, and he saved me a few bucks for needed maintenance.  I thanked him for his service as well as what he did for me, all done and out at 1440, quite amazing, thankyou Josh, thankyou Mossy Nissan El Cajon.<//review>

This is my 3rd purchase from Mossy Nissan El Cajon and I could not be happier with the customer service, sincere salesmanship, and ability to meet my cost expectations. I will recommend this team to anyone interested in buying a car. Also, they have opened my eyes to the value of a lease. I was unsure in the past and wasn’t aware if there were even any benefits to a lease. The team here was incredibly helpful and pretty much changed my life in this purchase.</text>

I purchased a package deal in which I'd get 3 oil changes for a discounted price from Mossy Nissan of El Cajon. I brought my vehicle in for an oil change for the third time about a week ago. A couple of days after, I noticed that the car was leaking oil. I contacted the service department to schedule a time for me to get the car checked out so that they could rectify the situation. I was scheduled but told that it could take 2-4 hours to look at the vehicle to fix the issue, which I found to be frustrating. It's bad enough that I had to wait 2 hours for an oil change on my initial visit. Disgruntled by the situation, I was determined to try to figure out was wrong. I noticed  that the oil drain plug was loose. I went to an auto parts store purchased a wrench and fixed it myself. At best, it feels like the service was shoddy and careless because it's such a simple task. At worst, it seems a little suspicious that this happened after my last paid oil change.< /text>

It was amazing all I had to do was drop my car off and pick it up, they put me in a rental till my car was ready and they also did all the calling and handled everything for my car to get serviced through my warrantee. Mike helped me out and did a great job of keeping me in the loop. Definitely will be recommending & going back for any car maintenance! Missy Nissan was so welcoming and helpful; they helped me more than the dealer who sold me my car when I had questions about my warrantee and how to get my car fixed.</text>

I have had a Nissan for almost four years now and I am satisfied with it. Charlie has been helping me look into upgrading to one of the newer models and keeping in touch with me. I definitely plan on coming in for a car sooner than later.< /Text>

< review>
I made an appointment online for oil change which said would be 40. When I picked up my car it was 86. He said that he used special oil. He didn't review my inspection like other dealerships have done and he continued to argue with me about the price then when I read the invoice it said I had agreed on the upgrades. Worst experience ever<//review>

<Text>I'm grateful for Derek who was a great help when picking out my new car, and now Andy through service. Both gentlemen are very professional, honest, and get the job done! I also love the shuttle service when I bring my car in. I can get my errands done while my car is in the shop which is great. Everyone I've met in person at Nissan is friendly, welcoming, and informaritive.
Thank you Nissan for treating me so well!!< /Text>< Pics>

It was great! Soran worked his magic and found me the car I wanted. I love it. I appreciate the time he took to compare cars with me and even let me see if I wanted a moon roof in my car. 😃 too hot for me, but looked nice.
Thank you Soran for helping us purchase our 4th car with the Mossy Family.

After picking up my vehicle, I tried calling in order to ask questions about my service.  I picked up the vehicle on Wednesday and due to social distancing and the number of people in the waiting room, I said I would call to ask further questions.  I called Wednesday, May 13th at 10am after picking up my vehicle, Thursday, May 14th, and Friday, May 15th and have yet to receive a call back in regards to my service.
Also, a small detail - why does Nissan no longer wash the vehicles when there is a car wash available on site?< /Text>

<Review>This dealership is fantastic. Honestly, I had a wonderful experience. Tony, my salesman, was great. He showed me a few vehicles that were within my parameters I set. He was knowledgeable and super friendly. None of the staff were pushy, and Tony got me into my Nissan Juke that day with payments below my requested price. By far the best car buying experience I've had. (And I've had quite a few)</Review></record>

Make sure that you read everything very carefully before signing. My paperwork had to be redone twice, because they kept making “mistakes” where the price of the car went up first by $150, then by $50, above the agreed price.
Service was ok at best, the staff was nice but not very willing to work with you. Did not seem to know what was going on most of the time, and had to keep checking with their managers to find out more info. I spent more time sitting alone at a desk while the salesman tried to figure out how to sell a car than anything else.
Would definitely choose another dealer to buy from next time.< /Text>

<Review>Jaeden was great!!!  I was disappointed that it took as long as it did, but that was not his fault.  I thought since we had done everything with Milad online and over the phone, it would go a lot faster.  But Jaeden made us very comfortable and was very knowledgeable about the vehicle and was great the entire time.  I would definately recommend him highly!!!!</Review></record>

<review>Went in despite my previous experiences. Just got brand new tires with alignment and balancing done February 5th. They told me everything was fine. today they check the alignment did an inspection under the tires and rotated the tires, again they told me everything is fine everything is good. what you are seeing in the picture is oil-contaminated grease on the right rear shock which is unknown mileage. This indicates that the rear shocks are leaking in should be recommended for a replacement. in the past they have also said everything was fine during their inspection, when the vehicle was taking in with burnt-out bulbs cracked and splitting wiper blades and other major issues. They failed to do with the paperwork properly, as well as filling to provide inspection reports which their own paperwork says you're supposed to get. and the saddest part is every time I've taken my vehicles in I have worked with the assistant service manager. I've complained to him multiple times about the poor quality of their technicians work, even letting him know that I am trained and have worked as a technician myself so I know what a good job is supposed to look like. And still after 5 months from the first time I've talked with them, they still can't get things right. Update, over a week later and no one has reached out to me as they said they will.

New update as of June 13th. apparently they decided to have the same service advisor that I've been dealing with and having troubles with try giving me a call. Got a news flash for you Mossy. Do you seriously think I want to keep dealing with the same exact person who is being dishonest with me, is that your attempt to try and make things right by having a known dishonest employee try contacting me. the proper thing to at least start trying to remedy something like this is to at least have the general service manager contact me himself seeing how he's the superior to the guy I've been having issues with. you may be able to screw most customers who never look underneath their vehicle and don't even probably understand what they are looking at if they do but it doesn't work with me.

Update June 15th
I have spoken with the general manager. Tuesday afternoon I'll be going to give him a demonstration in a small training session on how to properly inspect a vehicle during service.

Probably final update June 18th
I met with an walk the general manager around my vehicle today. he admitted to me that a lot of the things that they miss seeing was pretty much an excusable from a business in customer service. He tells me he's going to see about making some changes based on a few things he even learned from me about the industry and what to look at. In closing I just want people to be mindful of my experience, but don't be afraid to give them a try in the aftermath in case they do make improvements.</review>< Time>

Anthony (Tony) was amazing! No pressure, took his time, and sold me an amazing Nissan Murano within my budget. I highly recommend going to See Tony if you are looking for a new car. Thanks Mossy for making my car buying experience less stressful.

<Review>Got a new Rogue on Saturday and had the best experience ever! Tony was our salesman and he really listened and is very knowledgeable, he and Mike, the manager, really helped us out. My husband and I weren't sure we would be able to get anything yet, there were 5 months left on our Cruze lease, but with a 1 year old and a long road trip coming up we didn't want to do it in that little car, we knew it would be uncomfortable and not enough space. So we decided to see if we could get out of the lease early, even though we didn't think it would fit our budget. They really worked with us, we got exactly what we wanted, and an incredible deal, that we just couldn't pass up. Everyone there was really great and we are so excited about our new Rogue!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1556574890233, 'text': 'Thank-you Stephanie!'}<//response><Gmap_id>0x80d959d22e0ef5f9:0x51a6237cea3c5fbc</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is the third time I have leased a car from Mossy Nissan El Cajon.  The reason is first, the excellent salesman I worked with, Derek Cornell.  I leased my first Rogue through Derek in 2013.  Returned to him to lease again in 2016 and now in 2019.  He is professional, personable, explains clearly and is dedicated to meeting my needs.  I also found the service center to be excellent when I returned regularly for maintenance.< /text>

<Review>Khar is a SUPERB service advisor manager! He is always available on Saturdays and very easy to make appointments with him!

On the other hand, I have reported this repeatedly that they should put some napkins with their coffee condiments but the management never made any improvements at all.< /Review>< Time>

Mossy Nissan El Cajon just charged my family member over $500.00 for brakes and oil and $300.00 of it was for labor costs! Now she can’t pay her bills this month. One of the descriptions was “Labor to perform maintenance interval.” Like that’s a real thing. That was $95.00! And then they wanted to do it to her again for next payday! $400.00 for fuel injection. Mossy should give a disclaimer/warning on their new cars. Warning. Not recommended for sale to those who are not rich. We cancelled the next appointment and won’t go back ever again.
I forgot to mention that they tried to charge me for an "arm" $1,000.00 last year and then they put it in wrong. Caused very loud screeching noises. I had to bring it back in and they said it was put in wrong.< /text>

I went into Mossy Nissan of El Cajon for a routine oil change. When I went in I decided to browse around the showroom for a SUV for my family. I was approached by a young gentleman by the name of Anthony who asked if I had any questions. I told him that I was interested in trading in my vehicle to get an SUV for my family. He asked me if I had time so he could show me around and give me some options that may suit me. I told him yeah and he was very hospitable as well by offering me something to drink. We went out to the car lot and he showed me a list of different options in my price range. he was not pushy or trying to shove a certain vehicle at me. Instead we started with the base models and worked our way up. He let me test drive two different models and I fell in love with each one. We then came back to the dealership and worked on seeing what the price range would be for my monthly bill. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get the financing that I wanted so I passed on that deal. But he did not let me leave unhappy because he presented me another option that I ended up taking. He asked me if I was interested in trading my older car in for a newer car because they had dealership bonuses and rebates for purchasing a newer vehicle. I did want a new car no matter what and something more spacious and luxurious. He showed me the Nissan Altima 2018 Sr series. Very sporty and rims and at the same price as the base model at the time of the sale. Got me a great deal on the trade-in value of my vehicle and we sign the paperwork. Anthony took his customer service to the next level by meeting me at my job because I was in a hurry to get to work. We filled out the paperwork at my job and made it official. This guy is top-class customer service and the dealership is very lucky to have him. I give the dealership and Anthony a 5-star rating because it is well deserved.< /review>

Karr our service advisor gave a great deal on four new tires and oil change.  Great service and even shuttled us to we’re we wanted to go while getting the car done. 😀👍Come to find out he didn’t give us the warranty on the tires.  After having an issue on one of the tires a good person st Nissan took care of it. For that reason I’ll leave the five stars.</Text>

I scheduled a drop off taxi to take me back to my house and when I got checked in the person who was going to drive me back home was sitting there on his phone and texting and I had to wait for him to get done before I can get taken back to my residence. I made the reservation for a certain time and he took me when he felt like it so i would like that part of the aspect to be a little bit more prompt as far as customer service.

on the other hand, Sarah is the best and I will continue to go back to her all the time for the journey of my car.<//Text>

This review has no reflection on the service technician them self. It is my overall experience with my car which I loved. My car is 5 years old and it already needs a new transmission and cooler kit according to the service writer. I cant believe this, I understand my car has 106,000 miles. A service bulletin was put out about the cooler kit needing to be added to my vehicle. which I was told i needed to pay for myself. I call Nissan of North America I received a case number, of course when i took my car in for diagnostic before even looking at the car the service writer said ohhh yeah new transmission. A $4,500, I cant understand, on a 5 year old car. On top of this they need to "keep" the car for additional diagnostic just in case. I was also told I would need to pay for my own rental car, Chula vista offered my when my phone call was transferred to the wrong location. I did receive a call the following day saying I needed to bring my car back for additional information, at this point i have not done so. Before leaving on the previous day, Other recommendation were suggested totaling 8,700. which I would need to miss work for as well as have a rental car for a week on my expense. My car is not ever worth that much. This is all very disappointing to me.<//Review>

<Review>This review is specifically for the service center: Robb and Elijah.
Went to my mechanic yesterday because my check engine light was on and showing a P0101 error meaning there is an issue with the Mass Airflow Sensor. Mechanic called Nissan to see if he could order the part, Joe in the parts department notified him it was under warranty and advised me to make an appointment ASAP. My mechanic cleared the error codes to turn off my check engine light and sent me on my way.
Showed up at 7am for my appointment this morning and left my car with Robb. Got a call around 9am that because the error code was cleared, Nissan could not service my car. At no point yesterday did anyone advise those codes needed to be kept in the system for it to be covered under warranty. Spoke with Service Manager Elijah who advised that there was nothing he could do until my Check Engine Light came on again. For them to hook up the computer to my car takes no more than 5 minutes (I watched my mechanic do it yesterday) there was NO reason it should have taken over 2 hours. All over a $20 part, he was citing company policy and attempting to blame the miscommunication on my mechanic and not taking responsibility for the actions of him team. I got nothing more than an apology for the frustration experience. As they say, never ruin an apology with an excuse.
So now I'm expected to drive my car, which has been having performance issues due to the MAF, unsafely with a KNOWN issue from here to Arizona this weekend. This is by far the worst customer service experience I have ever dealt with.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Mike York my service advisor was super legit.  He was very knowledgeable about Nissan's in general.   He was honest unlike other  service advisors that I have dealt with in the past.   He honored the military discount and didn't inflate the price and call it a "discount".  Thank you you for your honesty and professionalism sir.   I will definitely return for all my 2008 Altimas 3.5 SL service needs.</review>

< Review>
I scheduled a drop off taxi to take me back to my house and when I got checked in the person who was going to drive me back home was sitting there on his phone and texting and I had to wait for him to get done before I can get taken back to my residence. I made the reservation for a certain time and he took me when he felt like it so i would like that part of the aspect to be a little bit more prompt as far as customer service.

on the other hand, Sarah is the best and I will continue to go back to her all the time for the journey of my car.</Review>

<Review>This is hands down the best car shopping experience I have ever had.  My car guide was Soran Pasha, who is experienced, intuitive, knowledgeable, and patient.  I never felt pressured or manipulated to make decisions I was not ready to make.  Soran answered questions regarding the specs on each car we test drove and shared his love of autos with us.  If you ask for Soran, you will not be disappointed.  In fact, the staff at Mossy Missan were all courteous and helpful.  It took a long time for me to get insured to drive home my new car, but they were awesome and not as impatient as I was.  I will be looking forward to working with Soran in future regarding servicing my new Nissan.<//Review>< gmap_id>

A mix of false promises, with no proof of what was done, and no follow up really does not put any trust in El Cajon Nissan. My car was in for the 15k mile tune up and it was not performed after being there all day.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Matt Ivko was my service adviser.  He took me on time.  We went into his office.  He explained exactly what was going to happen.  I went into the waiting room.  Matt went into the waiting room to make sure I was comfortable and updated me on my car.  When my car was finished, (earlier then expected), we went back to his office and he went over the inspection and the service that just took place.  He answered all of my questions with answers I truly understood.  He is a wonderful service person.  He is exactly what you want and need to represent your company!< /Text>

Karr our service advisor gave a great deal on four new tires and oil change.  Great service and even shuttled us to we’re we wanted to go while getting the car done. 😀👍Come to find out he didn’t give us the warranty on the tires.  After having an issue on one of the tires a good person st Nissan took care of it. For that reason I’ll leave the five stars.<//text>

From the moment I drove onto the lot I was greeted with a smile and a hand shake! Shawn was fantastic. He helped my girlfriend and I find exactly what we were looking for. After a longggggg day we were finally able to drive our dream car off the lot. We hit some bumps in the process but Shawn never gave up and continued to help us until we got what we wanted. Once we finally got our car we had to talk Manny who continued to make us knowledgeable and comfortable with our new purchase. I had so many questions and he was patient and extremely helpful.  From start to finish I had the most easy and successful experience a customer could ask for! Thank you Missy Nissan if El Cajon for all that you do! We will continue to do business with you in the near future 🙏🏼🙏🏼😅😅</review>< Pics>

<review>Went here for a blue Nissan leaf my wife found. Funny to be writing a positive review of a car dealer, but Derek was by far the best of the 5 dealers we went to. Took the time to listen and make our numbers work and clearly walk us through the process. Would refer anyone to Derek, and of course we love our leaf!!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

My experience with this storm is very bad I would never buy a nother vehicle at this store again. On  4/21/2018 I went to mossy to trade in my Ford edge so I can buy a Nissan Pathfinder. This car was on the Lot as a new car, I was very happy to buy my self a new car for the first time. After closing the deal I went  home and park it in my garage, two days later I realize it has 500 miles on it. I was very unhappy I went back to the store to talk to the store manager about it. He's response to me was what do you want me to do you already signed the check and he walked away and went back to his desk. He was very rude about it he did not even try to find out nothing about it . From my experience a car with 500 Miles on it should not sell as a new car. Now I have another problem with the tires on this car I have this car for less than two years and the tires on the front of this vehicle already need to be changed, thay have no thread leave on them. The other two  tires on the back are still looking brand new and I don't drive this car alot. If this car was a new car I should not have to change tires. Already  once again I went back to the store to complain about the tires and one of the Managers take a look at it and once again thay want to say that it is my fault that I did not rotate the tires. This manager told me that every time a vehicle come in for an oil change thay rotate the tires and if I do that my tires would not be like that. I know thats not true he is just lying on 12/31/2018  at 12.36 pm I  got an oil change done on that saame vehicle and they did not rotate the tires and l have proof because i have the paperwork. All I want is for the store to replace my two front tires. I just hope that no one else has to go through this bad experience that I go through.< /Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1580503343223, 'text': "Lincoln, thank-you for your feedback, we are so sorry to hear about your negative experience in dealing with our staff here at Mossy Nissan El Cajon. Yes, it is true that a vehicle can be sold as new with high mileage and may have it for a number of reasons. However, regardless of the mileage on your vehicle, your new car warranties (3 year - 36,000 miles and 5 year 60,000 miles) won't begin until you purchase the vehicle so you will have the full extent of the warranty until roughly 36,500/ 60,500 (to the exact mileage that you purchased it at).  Unfortunately tires are not covered under manufacturer warranties. What I believe the sales manager was trying to express is that tires SHOULD be rotated with at least every other oil change, but no it is not a given that service will do it because it is an additional cost, and it is not included in an oil change. Typically your tires should wear fairly evenly and that is why the manager was suggesting that the tire rotations most likely haven't been done like they should have been.  Again, we are so sorry that you have not been treated with the utmost respect we aim to give every customer and that you have not been completely satisfied with your experiences  with us. Please reach out to our general sales manager to discuss further (619)588-0500 ext 0."}< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80d959d22e0ef5f9:0x51a6237cea3c5fbc</Gmap_id></record>

<Review>I have been coming to Mossy for 5 years for all of my oil changes and maintenance/upkeep on my 2014 Juke. I love my car and I love that the service department is helpful and efficient. They always go over recommendations and never try to "upsell" me unnecessary services.

<review>Dropped my car off and what i was told would be done was not performed. What was said was done had no way to verify. As an example, i was told a multi point inspection was done, but nothing indicating what was checked. I know for a fact my car needs additional work and was expecting the inspection to tell me what exactly. As far as i could tell nothing was actually done to my car.

A mix of false promises, with no proof of what was done, and no follow up really does not put any trust in El Cajon Nissan. My car was in for the 15k mile tune up and it was not performed after being there all day.< /review>< pics>

Well Andy Fisher is the BEST service manager on the planet, why he hasn’t been promoted yet is beyond comprehension.. Wherever Andy goes we go, so you had better hang on to him !
Karl Kirker in Fleet Sales is our go to guy, you had better keep him also !
Joe in the parts department, and John the mechanic, are always there for us !
You now Have a newcomer, Gary Femrite, in sales, who just helped us get a great deal on a 2020 Murano, for Fausto and Celeste’s 35 wedding anniversary.
He was kind, courteous, knowledgeable, and a big help in getting the deal done in a professional and expedient manor, you had better hang on to him too !</review>

I visited the parts dept.  The guy at the desk wasn't very helpful when I asked about an O ring that was missing from the part I was buying from them.  He said I would have to provide the vin for him to look it up. I guess their system is so antiquated that they do not have a cross reference for the part he was selling me.< /Text>

My daughter bought a car from Anthony. I was with her I was so impressed with him that I bought my car from him. He is the only reason I went to Nissan. We not only got new cars but we have extended our family.  Thank you Nissan and thank you Anthony.< /Text>

<review>I took my Nissan Sentra 2004 to Sarah in service (who is awesome) and unfortunately she told me that the repairs were more than what the car was worth. So I decided to trade it in and she recommended to talk to Tony. Tony made the car experience extremely easy. He was very understanding of my situation and got me a great deal. I ended up getting a Nissan Rogue 2016 (major step up from the Sentra). Tony explained all the details to me and it made buying a new car very easy. If you’re going to buy a Mossy Nissan at E Cajon I highly recommend Tony, he’s the guy to talk to.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Rating>5</Rating>< Gmap_id>

Derek my sales man was everything I wanted in a sales man. He was informative, he paid attention to what my needs were.

And the Sentra that I bought fits me like a glove.

I'm extremely happy with Mossy Nissan of El Cajon.

<review>I thought Nissan's were reliable and come to find out, ever since they started  installing these CVT transmissions everyone that owns a Nissan has or will have problems. Most don't last more than 120k miles, I took my car in since my transmission went out at 164k and the service guy said "Oh you got a good transmission, I have seen some go out at 20k". Once I left there I went online and did my research and found ton of ppl having the same issue, some having 3 transmission replaced and the car had less than 20k miles on it.

There is a bunch of lawsuits out at the moment and I hope Nissan gets it together... Oh not to mention these transmissions will cost you, your first born.< /review>< pictures>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>My experience with this storm is very bad I would never buy a nother vehicle at this store again. On  4/21/2018 I went to mossy to trade in my Ford edge so I can buy a Nissan Pathfinder. This car was on the Lot as a new car, I was very happy to buy my self a new car for the first time. After closing the deal I went  home and park it in my garage, two days later I realize it has 500 miles on it. I was very unhappy I went back to the store to talk to the store manager about it. He's response to me was what do you want me to do you already signed the check and he walked away and went back to his desk. He was very rude about it he did not even try to find out nothing about it . From my experience a car with 500 Miles on it should not sell as a new car. Now I have another problem with the tires on this car I have this car for less than two years and the tires on the front of this vehicle already need to be changed, thay have no thread leave on them. The other two  tires on the back are still looking brand new and I don't drive this car alot. If this car was a new car I should not have to change tires. Already  once again I went back to the store to complain about the tires and one of the Managers take a look at it and once again thay want to say that it is my fault that I did not rotate the tires. This manager told me that every time a vehicle come in for an oil change thay rotate the tires and if I do that my tires would not be like that. I know thats not true he is just lying on 12/31/2018  at 12.36 pm I  got an oil change done on that saame vehicle and they did not rotate the tires and l have proof because i have the paperwork. All I want is for the store to replace my two front tires. I just hope that no one else has to go through this bad experience that I go through.</text>< Pics>

{'time': 1580503343223, 'text': "Lincoln, thank-you for your feedback, we are so sorry to hear about your negative experience in dealing with our staff here at Mossy Nissan El Cajon. Yes, it is true that a vehicle can be sold as new with high mileage and may have it for a number of reasons. However, regardless of the mileage on your vehicle, your new car warranties (3 year - 36,000 miles and 5 year 60,000 miles) won't begin until you purchase the vehicle so you will have the full extent of the warranty until roughly 36,500/ 60,500 (to the exact mileage that you purchased it at).  Unfortunately tires are not covered under manufacturer warranties. What I believe the sales manager was trying to express is that tires SHOULD be rotated with at least every other oil change, but no it is not a given that service will do it because it is an additional cost, and it is not included in an oil change. Typically your tires should wear fairly evenly and that is why the manager was suggesting that the tire rotations most likely haven't been done like they should have been.  Again, we are so sorry that you have not been treated with the utmost respect we aim to give every customer and that you have not been completely satisfied with your experiences  with us. Please reach out to our general sales manager to discuss further (619)588-0500 ext 0."}</Resp>

I cant say it enough... I absolutely love this dealership.  From the moment you drive up onto the lot you feel like you are apart of the family. I bought my 2018 rogue from Anthony DeBarrows and he got me an amazing deal. I had been shopping around for a new car dealing with sleazeballs at other dealerships that I was expecting the same from him. TOTALLY NOT THE CASE. He had me laughing from the start. 11 months later I got into a horrible accident around xmas and my car was totaled. I knew right away I was going to go right back to Tony. I had called him up told him what happened and he kept reaching out to see how I was doing. He really went above and beyond for me. I decided then Nissan and Tony will be the only place for me. My mom was a die hard Honda driver for as long as I can remember. She was with me both times I was getting my cars. She even bought a car from Nissan and said Tony was the reason she made the switch. I can go on and on about how the company as a whole makes the car buying experience a breeze.</text>

My experience with your Service technician was absolutely amazing. I am use to feeling that the dealership is trying to make me pay for service that is unnecessary.   Karr on the other hand made me feel like he was looking out for my best interest.   Even though my car had to stay in the shop for over a week for repairs.  Karr called me on a regular basis to keep me updated and made sure my loaner car was working for me.   Karr needs to be a supervisor and train the rest of your service managers.< /Text>

<text>I've been getting my car serviced at Nissan for a long time. Customer service has had it's ups and down at this location for years.

An oil change took 4 hours once and 2 hours on another visit. So, I started to drive out of my way to find a friendlier experience at a different location.

Recently I've had to go back to this location due to time constraints. It seems as though they have changed a few things for the better. I'm happy again.

In my opinion service is best in the late afternoon.<//text>< UserId.>

< review>
I recently came in looking to trade my motorcycle in. I met with Jaeden and he showed me a gorgeous 2020 Nissan Altima SR. I feel in love with it when I seen it! Jaeden and the finance team over at Mossy Nissan of El Cajon were able to get me a great deal with a great apr! They went back and fourth with the bank to get this deal done and in the end I left with a brand new car. Riding my motorcycle was fun but now I can enjoy driving my family around in a safe vehicle.<//review>

Iv recommended my entire family here to buy cars and they all feel the same. They make you feel like your at home and family. *****   If your looking for a new or used vehicle give Mossy Nissan El Cajon a chance to show you how they conduct Business....</text>

**UPDATE PENDING**
Shawn Hussain is the man! While all the employees here we're polite and knowledgeable, he was the best!  He listened to what I wanted and looked for every discount I could get. If there were any option for 6 stars Mossy Nissan of El Cajon would get it.
🌟Great selection on and off site!
🌟Competitive financing! (BEAT Navy Federal's rate!)
🌟Nice and clean facility!
🌟Knowledgeable salespeople who work for you!
🌟Military discount!
🌟A good chill vibe. Not pushy.

I went to buy a part. Very helpful, but took a few minutes of standing at the parts counter to get noticed by the 2 men behind the counter, both at computers. Auto salesman approached later on the lot, all smiles. When I told him I wasn't ready to buy another Nissan, his expression went flat, and he was gone in a second. I will buy another Nissan soon, but not from him.< /text>

<Review>We were greeted in the front lot by Isai Estrada, Sales Consultant who was friendly, patient and very helpful. We test drove a few models and zeroed in on the model we came in to see. From there Gary Craig, Purchasing & Leasing Consultant worked with us (and for us) to make the numbers work. Then off to the Finance Manager, Marco Obeso who was very detailed and informative.

Our overall experience was great!

It makes you feel good buying from a Dealership you genuinely like.
We're very satisfied with our 2019 Nissan Frontier SV Crew Cab.

With the exception of my Service Adviser who is great, I don't feel that Nissan gives adequate inspection service. I brought my car in to be serviced on this past Saturday, told everything was ok just needed to replace air filter soon. Only to be stranded a few days later due to my battery leaking cells and died on me while I was in Big Bear on a bridge over the lake where it is was very dark. Had to wait over an hour for a tow truck and then had to get a new battery. Cost me almost $300. This could have been prevented had the service technicians done their job without rushing my car through to process the next vehicle. The connector cables were very loose as well. Also, and this is an example: my windshield wipers were ok, but at my last service inspection I was told they needed to be replaced. Have not replaced them as of yet so how are they ok now? I'm a VERY concerned customer. Did my vehicle get an actual Point Inspection the hour I was there because CLEARLY things were missed. Highly disappointment with Nissan! I think your service technicians are rushing, are over worked and don't do their job to the best of their ability. Luckily, I didn't have any children with me when this occurred.<//review>

I have to give this low review due to the financing supervisor being so rude while we were talking the financing agent. Keep in mind they knew that it was my wife's birthday. Clay the Sales Rep was great and honest. But, that all went downhill during the financing process. FYI, my wife has great credit and that was not the issue.

For example:

Me: "Sir, how much does it cost to replace the battery on a Leaf Nissan."

Financing Agent: "I don't know its 10:00 PM."

Me: I am worried repairs about this vehicle since I have never worked on an electrical vehicle."

Financing Agent: " Don't worry about it you will not keep the car for over 4 years." FYI - I am financing for 6 years!!!!

Then to top off this rude service some female supervising/manager BANGS on the door saying I have to put something away. At this point I am done and get up to leave. These people ruined my wife's  birthday present.!!!!

I will follow up to find out who that female supervisor was in order to inform NISSAN what type of customer service people they have working for them.

Again Clay was great everyone else no customer service.< /text>

I would give this a 0 star if possible...…
I made an appointment to have my car services. I arrived at my appointment time only to find out the lift is broken. (Why did I not get a call cancelling my appointment?).   After I left, I received an e-mail telling me that I missed my appointment only to be followed by a phone call asking about how my service went. I called back to give my feedback and was hung up on.        When I left the initial appointment (or lack of), I was told someone would call me 2 days later with a status update.   No call received.  I have now tried calling 3 more times only to be sent to the black hole of voice mail.   Nobody in the service department seems to want to work at customer service.           This is our second service with Mossy EC - at the first one, they disputed that we bought the extra protection and we had to prove it to them only to have them not believe us so they had us wait 4 hours to verify the policy - which was correct by the way.<//text>

Mossy Nissan was a Amazing experience. I have bought several cars before and I have never got such a deal like this one. Karl Kirker was fantastic was fantastic, he wasn't pushy, gave me different options and he really worked really hard to get me best price and payment I was looking for. When it came time to sign the paperwork Franco did not pressure me to buy extra things but gave me a really good deal on something I wanted. Mossy Nissan has a really wonderful caring team. I wont ever buy anyplace else.<//Text>

<review>Worst place ever. DO NOT BUY A CAR HERE. Very dishonest and False promises made. Was told a year ago that if I co-signed with my sister, she can "EASILY" their words refinance in a few months to get me off the loan and build her credit. It's been 1 and 1/2 years and when we went to refinance, they said not our problem go to a bank or credit union. I called dealer in attempts to rectify this matter and for lack of a better term, they blew smoke "you know where" again as if to say I'm not important, any longer they already made the sale last year.  They never called me back after promising that he'd talk to Vincent and see if something can be done. Now I'm angry, at least acknowledge that nothing can be done. During the purchase VINCE the Sales Rep will jump up and down and make it sound like you made a purchase of a life time. Be careful, they'll scam you quickly. I DO NOT recommend this dealership for their shady practice and plan to contact the Better Business Bureau so that other innocent people don't get wrapped into buying a car from this less than caring and heartless dealer that only focus on "their winnings".  There are other dealers that will be honest and sincere.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Worst experience ever we wanted a blue rogue and they thought just by our looks we couldn't afford  it. You did us a favor we went over to El Cajon Ford and got a fully loaded blue edge with the premium warranty and 0% financing we couldn't be happier. You really shouldn't judge a book by its cover. If I could give -5 on stars I would. You should also know what your President day specials are. #ElCajonFordRocks</text>

< review>
I bought a used 2016 Nissan Rogue yesterday at Mossy Nissan in La Mesa/El Cajon. Tony was my “salesman”. Couldn’t have asked for a better experience! While he iiiiis a salesman, he didn’t try to sell me on anything I didn’t need or want. He asked what I was looking for, and we walked the lot for a few minutes to see my options. I was upfront in saying nothing down and what I wanted my monthly payment at. He didn’t try to push any upgraded models on me, or even try to show me what features I was missing out on if I stuck to the lower model that hit my price point. The dealership may see that as a downfall, not trying to upsell a more expensive model (hopefully not, as I never write reviews and would hate for this one to backfire on Tony). I’m the type though, if I told you my needs and wants, and what I want to spend, and you push for more, I’ll walk and go somewhere else. So, in a sale for someone of my type, Tony was on point from start to finish. Super knowledgeable on the cars, helped me set up the Bluetooth feature before I left the lot. He was awesome, very personable, and fun to talk to while finance was doin their thing. His manager (sorry, forgot his name) was awesome. I honestly don’t recall a single employee passing by me without saying hello with a smile on their face. Great dealership! Great employees! Great experience! ‘Nough said.</review>

<review>I had made an Appt. for Saturday, I had told the Lady who assisted if she could change my name that they had on file, when I got to the dealer  the name had not been changed so I asked the adviser if he could please change it which he assured me and he supposedly did in front of me. I called back today because I lost my receipt and the gentlemen who answer was very polite and he said if an available adviser can call me back due to them being busy so then this guy calls me back ( did not sound professional at all) and says you had a question?? I explained to him and he tries to look up my vehicle with first last name and that did not work and then when he looked it up with VIN he says well the Adviser did not change the name,  and I'm just like well I asked specifically two times to change the name so I asked to speak with Manager and he says its me your talking to, so that was a big surprise because he surely did not care about Customers and I was about to spend almost 2K in service which in this case I rather take my money elsewhere.</review><user_id>111685339973686865061< /user_id><Response>{'time': 1544827542737, 'text': 'Hello Steph & Danny, I am very sorry for the way this situation was handled and am available if you would like to discuss it further.

I told him up front I was not buying a car, just doing research on three different vehicles for my wife who is having visibility issues in our current car.  He showed me each one, got to sit in each one and he answered all my questions(I had a lot.) He probably spent at least an hour with me going over all the features of each car. Besides the loud mouth on the megaphone outside your dealership, my experience was fantastic. Please pass this along to Joseph for his professional courtesy and outstanding knowledge of all vehicles. One more thing, there was absolutely no pressure at all to buy that day!! I appreciated that very much.<//Review><username>Matt Kissel<//username>< time>

I think they are unethical. I responded to an ad for a used car at 9:00 am the day after the ad was placed. Asked if car was available and was told It was, to first offer; which I promptly made at offering price. Wanted to pay cash. Completed all paper work. Salesman said he had to check with manager. Overheard manager say something about loss leader and no profit. They refused to accept my offer. Said car was already sold.< /Review>

<review>Great customer service (I had Edgar Suarez as my service advisor). An oil change, tire rotation, and car wash took about an hour and a half on a Friday. Not too bad compared to some of the other Nissan places in SD. The only negative thing I have to say is that I mentioned a weird sound my car was making when I first got there and it seemed like they were going to take a look at it but didn't mention it afterwards. I forgot to ask about it before I left but my car seems to be fine now so maybe it was a quick fix and they just didn't mention it? Overall, good experience though.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1458083788572, 'text': 'Hi Cheyenne,\nThank you for sharing your experience at Mossy Nissan El Cajon, especially with Edgar.

After buying 3 cars at El Cajon Mossy Nissan, I experienced the best customer service with Anthony DeBarrows as the salesman!  He has sold me my 4th and 5th cars from El Cajon Mossy Nissan and I couldn't be happier!  If you want a salesman to work for you, you need to see Anthony DeBarrows!<//Review>

My experience at Mossy Nissan dealership has been nothing but the best. I had a 2010 jeep compass I thought I could never get rid of. The salesman David Gunn really helped me out a lot . He was very patient, understanding and helped me get the best deal. Also,  the finance manager Mark Benchekroun was very helpful and patient. He broke everything down to me and made sure I walked out the dealership with the best deal. I highly recommend going to this dealership.< /Text>

<text>I love this place!  They are so friendly and helpful.  I am always apprehensive about trying to purchase a car because of how some places and salesmen treat females....but not here!  They treated me like family from start to finish.  The General Manager, Jake McElroy is such a nice guy and he makes time for his customers. I worked with Joe Chavez and the sales manager Bill Dorrel when I purchased my Armada, such an amazing experience.  The finance guy Marco was super helpful in helping me make the decision on the "extra" stuff that I wanted and was not at all pushy. I will definitely be going back to them for all of my future new car purchases.<//text>< username>

I have bought several of my vehicles at Mossy Nissan and have always gone with Bill Dorrel. I followed him from Kearney Mesa,  Escondido and now El Cajon. I refer all my family and friends to him and they have never been disappointed and neither have I. I trust him and know he will always listen and take care of me and what I am looking for.<//Review>

<Text>My name is Ziba, I purchased my car from Mossy Nissan in El Cajon on ------------, when I purchased the my car it only had ---- miles and the sales person in the dealership assured me that the vehicle is without accident  and in almost new condition, he also gave me a Carfax at the time of purchase which showed no accident or issues with the car. I recently had a scratch on my front bumper and took it to a body shop to remove the scratch by polishing the bumper, they have noticed the entire front passenger side of the vehicle was involved in a major accident which was not disclosed by the dealer at the time of sale, the bodyshop also showed me how the paint is different and how the front bumper and fender were both removed and fixed and pout back.
I am a woman who never shopped for a car on her own, and the reason I purchased my vehicle from this dealership was to make sure I do not get scammed by third-party sellers and small dealers.
I went back to the dealership as soon as I noticed the issue and spoke with Vincenzo Tomasello which introduced himself as the sales manager in Mossy Nissan of El Cajon.
He ran a new Carfax and showed me that there was no accident at the time of purchase to disclosed and told me I can go to the court if I want to but they will not do anything about this issue.
I know my car is now worth at least $4000 below market due to the accident and I will have a very hard time selling it in the future, I am choosing to take this mater to the court, DMV and also filing a complaint

< Review>
The assistant manager called and told me a shuttle would be picking me up within the hour so I could get my Sentra back. An hour and a half later, still nothing. I called back twice and left a VM to get an update. I had to call the customer service line to get assistance. When he finally called me back, he said my car is still not fixed yet, because the person working on my vehicle went to lunch and never informed him. He then said it would be another 30 mins for the shuttle. It’s been another 40 minutes and still nothing. My car needed a sensor change & then washed. That’s it. It has now been over 5 hours since my appt. I wish Mossy Nissan had been honest and provided me an overestimation of time on how long it was supposed to take to fix my vehicle, rather than lie and waste my time. I could have worked out my day accordingly if I had know it was going to take all day. My time is extremely valuable just like everyone else. I had a lot to get done today and still have no clue when my car will be done or when a shuttle will be by to pick me up (I live 3.5 miles away). I have been a loyal customer to Nissan for over 5 years. I’m completely disappointed and will no longer be getting my vehicle serviced here.< /Review>

< Review>
Going into Mossy Nissan with all the options and types of vehicles to choose from I luckily had the pleasure to work with Randy Shamo, who not only made it easy to narrow down the type of vehicle I was interested in but also worked out a great deal for me. I could not be happier with my Nissan Rogue and especially the great customer service that was shown to me. Thank you Mossy Nissan and Thank You Randy Shamo.</Review>

<text>NOT TOO HAPPY with the auto service area. Andy was very rude, I scheduled an appointment with him to have my car serviced, the day of my appointment he tells me-- I do not have time for your car today, come back another day. Completely blows me off. SO OF COURSE I reschedule for another appointment (with a supervisor) 6 weeks later & $600.00 spent (for a tune-up) my car is now leaking oil and is running HOT. This will be my very last time having my car serviced at the MOSSY NISSAN OF EL CAJON. UNDERSTAND IT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT THE MONEY $600.00 SPENT ON A TUNE-UP IT IS ABOUT MY TIME AS WELL, & ME HAVING THE ISSUE OF AN OIL LEAK AND NOW MY CAR RUNNING HOT.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1440698479831, 'text': 'Hi Amber,\nWe appreciate your feedback with your experience at Mossy Nissan El Cajon and are sorry that we failed to meet your satisfaction.

I had the best salesman, Tony. I was not looking forward in purchasing a car, but with his patience, knowledge and honesty the process was easier. I will be referring all my friends to Mossy of El Cajon.</Text>

Travis in financing explained everything in detail and went through each of the forms in detail.  Khar in the service department is always ready to take care of my concerns and questions in regards to servicing my Nissan.  The dealership itself is a very fun place to be.

<Text>Unreal how long I have been having to wait just for a key to be made. My car was stolen from me and so when I got it back, I couldn't drive it Bc I didn't have a key. With Nissan keys , they have a chip so to be replaced you need to reset the system. They quoted me $120. 2 and half days later I still don't have my car and my quote went up $160. So now this process is taking 3 days and $280 to get my car back. RIDICULOUS SERVICE!</Text>< gmap_id>

The mossy Nissan in El Cajon has a very bad customer service. I don't recommend anyone buying a car from there because they don't help with anything and they just take money for no reason.

<Review>Worst service I had in my entire life! I made an appointment for service and tire change at 9:30 am, I was told that it was going to be ready at 12:30 pm and is already 3:20 and not ready, they didn’t even change the tire and I have to wait longer till they finish! Don’t bring your car here they’re slow and unfriendly.</Review>< gmapID>

< review>
I tagged along with a friend to go car shopping, and we ended up at Mossy El Cajon after only going to one other place. As soon as we walked on the lot, Manny walked right up to us and introduced himself. We explained that we were really just looking, and he stuck around to answer our questions anyway. My friend didnt have the best credit, and Manny explained to him the process, and that he was sure they would be able to finance him. It turns out that not only were they able to finance him, but they got him an amazing rate with a payment that fit his budget. They did not pressure him at all, but simply ran the numbers to show him what they could do for him. I have bought cars in the past, but this is by far the best dealership I have ever been to. My friend ended up buying a 2012 Nissan that day, and drove off in it within a couple of hours. While shopping with my friend, I became interested in a 2013 Altima. I ended up back at the lot 2 days later, and I also drove off the lot within a couple of hours. Manny helped us both out, and has gone out of his way to call us both to check up on us. They also have a kid friendly environment where they put a movie on for my 2 kids while we did all the paperwork to keep them from getting bored.This was by far the best car buying experience I have ever had. If you are looking for a new car, I would definitly recommend Manny, and the rest of the team at Mossy Nissan of El Cajon!<//review>

Had a 12.45 apt for the check engine light.  I was waiting in the lobby.  After 2 hours I hadn't heard anything, so I sought out the service technician.  They quoted about another hour...because the mechanic servicing my vehicle went to lunch halfway through.</review>

I want to share my experience, as a single female , using the Mossy Nissan Service Dept. . Over many years now and several vehicles the service has been excellent ! Every service rep has been nothing but helpful, professional ,and really gone out of their way to get my car taken care of even when my arrival was at the last minute !! One uneducated guy does not represent this Dept. Ladies !<//Review>

<rating>2</rating><review>IDK how to start this it is going to be long story I'll try to make it shorter:
I received an email about building my next nissan and I was kinda excited and wanted to give it a try. So I went online and start building the Sentra Nismo which is a car I really liked when I first saw it. I finished building it and I looked at the price was something possible for me to get it I entered my information to get contacted. And after couple hours I received a call from Nissan regarding my request and the person who called me said it is not going to be available because I still have my leased Sentra from last year I will need to wait another year. So I said okay and that's really helped me to understand my situation. and then couple more days I received a V.I.P experience invitation from David Gunn (a Certified Internet Manager) and he offered me to go there to the dealership and to have:
(•   The Sentra here, ready for you to test drive
•   An on-site professional appraisal of your current vehicle by our Certified                    Management team
•   Processing of your online application ahead of time to expedite your time here and                    get you on the road in your new car quicker ).
So I said sweet why not let me go and check it out so I called to make an appointment with David Gunn today at 11:00 AM and I had to go there anyway to get my normal service for my current Sentra. I went there at 11:05 AM and David was not there they told me he had to take care of another customer. I worked for my entire life with customer service and if there is one thing I learn from that is to respect your time with your customers. Anyhow another sales person I believe his name was Isai he helped me out who was not even aware of why I am coming today he tried his best with me and I really appreciate his help a lot but there was so many different numbers and even the car itself it was not the one I was expecting or the one I build but I was really upset that the David who supposed to be the manager not takes care of his V.I.P customer. I mean I will never invite someone to be my V.I.P if I don't think I can handle his situation or at least give him what he was expecting. and I wasn't asking for the GTR it was just a Sentra for GOD sake. and they offered me with a pre-owned one not even a brand new car. I was really disappointment. and Isai wanted to his magic and help me get this Sentra and I told him from the beginning if you can get me the Nismo with the same deal I have with my Sentra then we can talk if you can't then please don't waste my time and your time because I can't pay anything more than $50 of what I am paying right now and I did my search online and I came up with the best deal that can fit my need but it is just shame that you couldn't take care of a V.I.P customer after you invited him in. My current Sentra I received the best deal ever in my life all thanks goes to Soran Pasha who gave me the best service and he became one of my dearest friends. I hope you see the pictures I included in my review. And I am sorry for the long story.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1501778478709, 'text': 'Hello Forat,\nIt is always our goal to give each and every customer a truly exceptional experience whether it is on the Sales Floor or in the Service Drive.

< review>
My husband and I wanted to purchase a truck, we came here because of their reputation and the fact that I had to turn in my Nissan Leaf (2014) early because I had hit the mileage too soon and did not want to finish the lease.  So we brought in our Leased Leaf and our minivan as trade-ins for the Nissan truck we bought with David Gunn.  Through the negotiations I wanted to be able to turn in my Nissan Lease with no penalties as a good customer for purchasing a brand new 2017 truck.  This appeared to be part of the deal and we left both vehicles and drove away with our new Truck.  In June I received a phone call from the Nissan Leasing agency saying I owed them for several lease payments and they would go to collections within the week if they were not paid (the lease was up in May according to their paperwork but I left it with the dealership in March....)
I called the dealership and  spoke to Travis (Finance Manager)  and after some searching it turned out my Nissan Leaf was never "grounded" and none of the paperwork was completed so basically it was as if the car was still mine. Travis told me he would get Manny Jurado (our finance guy from the purchase) and David Gunn in the loop and ensure this was cleared up ASAP.  Nothing happened.  I have had to call them over and over only to receive promises of things being resolved when in reality all the phone calls and communication between the two companies has fallen on me.  When I finally got a hold of David Gunn after a promised phone call from Manny Jurado never came through David clearly had NO knowledge of anything that was going on. (this was over several weeks!)

To make matters worse they turned in the Leaf in June without giving me a call to see if I had the charger cable for the car which resulted in the Nissan leasing group sending me a bill for a missing Tool (no description and another phone call) for $896!!! Now after trying to drop off the cable which we had but did not know had not been turned in (major lack of communication) they turned us down and said we have to mail it back to Texas to get our record cleared.
I clearly remember the Manager that night we purchased the truck asking us if they will get a 5 star review....at the time we said yes but I am sure glad I waited....this team needs to get its act together and take care of their customers.  I am extremely disappointed with this bungled process and their lack of concern.  It's clear they only care about selling the cars and not about any issues they create for the customer after walking out that door.<//review>

<Text>Service representative was Robb Workman 07/15/2017 930am I went up there to get a oil change and have them look at my car A/C i was up there for 4 hours with my daughter And finally they came to me and said it was my Compressor that needs to be replaced and it cost 1100+ So of course i didnt have the money, he then told me everything that recommended that i get done ( tires,flush fluids and 90k service) so i get back home witch is 10 miles away and i start looking over there paperwork i was given to see if they gave me a breakdown on the charges for the compressor and i find out my car has a blown head gasket! So im really pissed that he did not mention this to me and allowed me to drive off the lot with this problem, i could have had something horrible happen to me and my daughter driving home with a blown head gasket. Now i have to take the risk of driving all the way back out there with this problem. How could he have been soo careless and not have told me something soo BIG like this.

He actually tried to say we lost them or misplaced them. Been a Nissan El Cajon customer since 1998, guess Mossy Nissan hires thieves and doesn't look out for their loyal customers.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80d959d22e0ef5f9:0x51a6237cea3c5fbc< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>
