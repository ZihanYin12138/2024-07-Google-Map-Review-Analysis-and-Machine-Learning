I'm fortunate to be a donor rather than a recipient but these are great people and appear to be treating everyone with respect. They're also more grateful to the donors than another local food bank!< /text>

This is very very bad and should be ZERO star, they give food accordingly to your race. They give the garbage of the store. All expired, rotten, and bad quality of service! God have MERCY.</Review>

Much less the shame I experience for needing a helping hand, the west valley food pantry is operated by amazing and caring individuals that come together to help others. It was my second time there and I truly appreciate the non-condescending manner in which these men and women operate. There is none of the issues that could potentially arise. I am blessed to have been led in that direction.< /review>

They are open to everyone who "qualifies" (low-income, homeless, jobless, etc.) irregardless of religion, race, or country of origin.

The Volunteers are friendly, nice, and helpful. 👍💖<//text>

This place is in need of plastic or cloth reusable bags to hand out groceries in, so please donate.( and bring some for yourself) They actually give meat and try to give a balanced assortment of food including special needs if you have them. They try to accommodate things like low sodium and sugar free.< /text>

<resp>{'time': 1559244187130, 'text': 'Hi Jessica: Are you referring to the different menus for homeless clients who wish to come weekly instead of once monthly? If so, understand that the amount of food given to our regular monthly clients is larger per visit, but the total amount the weekly client receives over 4-5 visits per month is comparable.\nThe weekly program is optional, and is primarily designed for people who have limited access to food storage, cooking facilities and refrigeration. If you prefer to receive the same food we give to our monthly clients, just ask the volunteer assisting you to change which program you are on.\nAlso, homeless clients can switch back to the weekly program at any time.\nI hope this answer addressed your concerns? Let us know if you have any questions, and thanks for the comment!'}<//resp><Date>1559241277614< /Date><Text>I understand ppl have homes n ppl r homeless but y limit them on food when they need it the most I think they need to offer ppl better food< /Text><rate>3</rate><name>Jessica Mejia</name></record>

A free food pantry. Workers there fill your bags with groceries, from breads,canned food, meat and produce. Must show evidence of residence. One can go there for food once a month.</review>

<rating>1<//rating><text>Heartbreaking! Absolutely heartbreaking. We stopped by on a Friday around 11:30 ish and as we walked into the registration desk to find one of the ladies who was part of the administration speaking loudly almost yelling at another lady who was there to pick up food. Then they were turning away people because they were to close to close time (noon). If we are supposed to be the hands , feet and heart of God that was definitely not the best way of showing his love. Word of advice, if you are going to do any volunteer work for the needy do it as if you were doing it onto God. People need to be loved not mistreated.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
This place is a hit and miss. Depending on the day you go there, you may be fed like a human, other days you go it's sure to be a long wait and the people are rude. It's almost as if the person making the schedule put all the pleasant volunteers on certain days and all the unpleasant ones on the other remaining days.

Example: they ask if you have a place to refrigerate food, and even if you say no , they'll still give you perishables. So, for someone homeless, which is the majority of their clients, you have to either eat it all then or let it sour.

That's not helping the community. There are other places in the area that have realized this error and made efforts or changes to their program. Not this place though.

Without Betty, this place is not what it once was.<//Review>

<Review>Great vibes, waitress was nice, my food could have been hotter, IPA on tap was delicious, we got a window seat facing towards main st, so that was cool. The creme Brule cheese cake was so good. Clean, good music, and I would def recommend and go here again!<//Review><gmapID>0x80eab91fe8c4ba57:0x47285bc89b490806</gmapID>< pics>

< review>
Only reason I’m giving it 4 is because it’s still new and they need to workout some kinks. Mainly timing. Our food came out later than expected, but at least they took care of our kids. Like I said this is new, so new that they just opened to the public a week ago. But the food was GREAT! My steak was cooked to perfection! My wife ordered the couples special which includes desert. Porterville really needs a place like this because it’s really hard to find great food here. We moved here from Monterey Bay. And have to go as far as Fresno or Bakersfield to find good food. Thanks to the staff and to the owner for finally opening up a place with class and a warm atmosphere.< /review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Went for dinner on Saturday 3/27/21 witnessed a disturbing argument between Restaurant manager and customer.  She was cursing and yelling at customer in front of her children and other families around her table. I can’t believe management would hire someone so un professional.  It was very disturbing and uncomfortable I asked who this waitress was? Because I wanted to complain about my service and report what I witnessed I was told assisting night manager/waitress “ Andrea”.  I wanted to make a complain about this waitress but she was management unbelievable.< /Text>< user>

<Review>I would give zero stars if it were an option. We had a reservation and we were still told to wait. My husband and I were the only Hispanics in there and the hostess jumped over us to seat another couple (that wasn’t hispanic) first and they didn’t even have a reservation. When we finally were seated, it took 20 minutes to get a server to even acknowledge us.  When our server finally decided to wait on us, we just ordered a few beers and got the hell out of there. I have never felt so uncomfortable in a restaurant before. I was so excited to see we were finally getting a decent restaurant in town but with service like that.. no thank you.</Review>< UserId.>

<Time>1604417484041<//Time><review>I LOVE their food. I eat there at least twice a week. But this time my Postmate forgot an item (fugazzis didn’t put it in the bag) and I called so I can pick it up later. The lady that answered was beyond rude telling me to ask the postmate to go back for it or to get a refund through postmates. Because “that’s what they do” ...  not even giving me chance to talk or go for my missing item. I’m not ordering anymore.< /review><gmap_id>0x80eab91fe8c4ba57:0x47285bc89b490806< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Very pleased with the meal and service from the staff. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. As far as the food goes, I ordered the salmon, and it was cooked to perfection. There was a little wait time, but the food made up for it. Also, the atmosphere and decor was remarkable, definitely coming back again.< /review>

<name>Jacob Rice< /name><review>We use to love this place. The service has never been great, usually just a little slow. Over the last year or so the quality has gotten progressively worse. Tonight our experience was not worth it in many respects. We called ahead, and when we showed up they didn’t have our reservation. Thankfully, they seated us anyway. There were multiple confusion regarding what drinks were available and the wrong wine came out with one of our drinks. We eventually got them out. We had the Brussels sprouts, which had less bacon and nuts than in the past. The tequila fettuccini that we use to LOVE was covered in watery sauce and the chicken wrap was dry and sauceless. Ultimately not bad food but definitely not worth the price. Our neighbor had a similar experience last night. We really hope this place makes a turn around, or else it’d be more wise to cook at home.</review>< gmap_id>

< Review>
I loved custom cuts! The guys in there work well together! Super engaging with literally all of their customers. They were really busy when we went in but they were quick about getting everyone in and out of their chairs! I wasn't mad about the prices either... very reasonable! I also loved my boys cuts! Thanks and we will be back< /Review>

This barbershop is supposed to be open until 7:00 PM. I showed up at 5:55 pm and was told that they could not help me anymore. What is up with that? Terrible. They are certainly not getting my business in the future.< /Review>

<username>Tracy Clagg< /username><Text>Disclaimer! Everyone in this establishment is amazing, on time and put out quality work. In exception to one person.

Do not book Rodrigo. I've booked with him twice, the first time I showed and he was cutting someone else at our appointment time, I generally give a 10 minute buffer, no worries, quality takes time. But I waited for over 35 minutes, I had to walk out. Im busy and have a tight schedule.

Thats fine, I get that people have bad days. So I gave him a second chance. Booked him for a 9:00 a.m, on a Saturday, figured since I'm the first cut of the day, he would be on time. He didn't even show for the day, and I didn't get word for over 25 minutes.

Thankfully, one of the co-owners (Adam) made it right, and gave me a free cut at 3:00 PM that day. Great customer service, he will still get a nice tip.They didn't lose my business, but Rodrigo definitely did.

You guys keep hustling! But cut the fat, it discredits the amazing business you have going on!< /Text><time>1598718346927</time><Rate>4< /Rate>< Resp>

I have had 5 different barbers cut my hair here over the past few months and have never been disappointed. I have referred this shop to everyone that asks where's a good place for a clean cut.<//Review>

I have been a loyal customer for 3 years, through COVID and all. This past year, when it has became an appointment only barbershop, I have been cancelled on 5 times. Yes 5 times! Like I said I have been a loyal customer for 3 years and have brought customers to the company! When I let them know I’ve been cancelled on 5 times, They didn’t do anything about their inconsideration. They have not accommodated to me as a customer and showed their lack of customer services. Such a bummer bc they have good barbers. But if I’m treated like this I don’t want to invest my hard earned money into their company. Would highly recommend another barbershop who makes you feel like your valued especially after 3 years of loyalty.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>I have been going here for some time now. There is some true skill in this barber shop. I do get my hair cut by one specific person but I look at what's going on and everyone looks sharp and happy when they leave. The shop is upbeat, clean, well kept up. Everyone is smiling and will welcome you as you walk in. I would recommend anyone to go here if they are looking for a top notch barber shop, you can't go wrong with anyone who works here.<//review>< pics>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I sat in the waiting chair for over an hour while the barbers chilled in the back. They also charge 25 for just the cut and take cash only and don’t tell you. But don’t worry! They conveniently have an atm. Over priced and over hyped. The hair cut wasn’t even anything special. They claim to give hot tow wrap but not one person received one.<//Text>< pictures>

I just moved to the area and have been trying to find a great barber for my son. After going to several shops I finally found one that does a great job.  My son told Pete what he wanted and he did exactly that and more. He even used the straight razor to make finishing touches on his line up. Everyone in there had a great personality and was very welcoming. Custom Cuts will have my business again.< /text>

Been going here for years and it WAS nice, not sure if it’s new management or the new people working there but it’s time to find a new place..
Their hours are not set. Call before going in.
Have come here  multiple times and it’s closed when they should be open...
Today I go in on a Sunday at 1:45 when they close at six and they tell me they’re done for the day... pretty f’d up..
I go on business travel tomorrow and was hoping to get a haircut when the place is open till six...< /text>

Quality. Great barber shop atmosphere, the barbers do an amazing job. Place can get busy at times, but that's because they are good at what they do. The attention they give to your cut is great. Can not recommend more.<//review>

<Review>The haircut was decent, if a little pricey. Definitely not worth the 2 hour wait time though. The atmosphere is upbeat and the staff is friendly, but there is only so much time you should waste waiting to get a haircut. It might seem like the more people waiting, the better the barber shop, but that wasn't the case here. If there's a line, I recommend going somewhere else.<//Review>< Pics>

Gina cut my hair and it's honestly the best haircut I've ever had. Everyone noticed my new cut and said it was awesome.
I'll definitely be back.</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
This place has really awesome vibes! First time going to this shop, and the price was well worth the patience, time, and work they put into my hair. I paid $20 for low taper, line up, and they still shaved the back for a super clean job. Money well spent. Thank you so much!</Review>

<Text>Joe did a great job on my hair and my beard and was very patient and informative when it came to my questions about my beard.  He is a really polite guy and I would recommend any one, even children, to schedule an appointment with him.  Worth the extra cash to skip the line at this very popular barber shop.<//Text>< Pictures>

Had a great experience here at Custom Cuts. Waited over a year to finally get a haircut and was recommended to visit Chris. He hooked me up with a clean cut that took my confidence to the next level.< /review>

Excellent hair cuts and beard trims.  Prices are competitive considering how much time and detail they put into the cuts here.  Also be prepared for a long wait as this place is very popular.< /Text>

<Text>Best cut I have ever had in my life.  Ask for the Babyface Barber.  Only regret is I live in another state or I would come in every couple weeks.

Great barber shop atmosphere to boot.   Enjoyed the hot towel and straight blade neck trim.

Can’t recommend highly enough.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Time>1517892121540</Time></record></dataset><record>

I have conflicting feelings. I called and asked if they have special needs experience. They said we are very patient. I took my 8 year old son for His Birthday hair cut. The barber did a great design. I showed him the picture of the haircut we wanted. We did not get the haircut we wanted nor was it styled when we left. My son was very wiggly. For my son he behaved very well. You pay 25 dollars for a design in your haircut. My hubby was frustrated with the haircut.<//text>

<user_id>115047313794120124130<//user_id><Review>Don't go in close to closing time, they won't give 100% within the hour of closing time. They just wanted to cut me and leave, I asked for a simple under cut with a fade but this new guy decided to give me a one on the sides and some reason only keep the length on the top front of my hair. And to top that off the back of my hair was cut in a way not even a different barber could tell what he was trying to do. Now I've been to this place plenty of times and they were great experiences, but this was just filled with anger and disappointment for the whole $25 I paid I could've gotten a pair of scissors and done myself. Just so you all know, I would prefer the barber with glasses, he puts his full work and effort in no matter what he has yet to disappoint me.</Review>< Rate>

Joe babyfacethebarber rules!! He cleaned up my beard and did things to make it look so much better! Really nice and personable too!

Edit: The very next day....as this review is not just about Joe and about the entire business, I am lowering the score due to my friend coming in the next day. All of the barbers did not even greet him when he came in and mostly ignored him! He was there to pick something up for me and had to find Joe. But no one would help him! They even did the same thing kind of to me, so I know my isn't lying. There are many other barber shops in the area, so I'm going else where!</review>

Best haircut for a reasonable price. They really take their time there to cut your hair the way you want it, they pay very close attention to detail. The wait is long, but very worth it. There are no appointments, sadly.<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Amazing little spot they got! Old school styled place, great friendly barbers. I don't know what that guy Nick H. who commented a while ago is talking about pricey? It's  $15- $20 a cut, plus tip? Not pricey at all. About the time waiting, either get there early or go on slow days, of course the weekends are gonna be more packed. Anyways, I always recommend that spot for people, especially picky people who don't let just anyone cut their hair. I've only had 3 barbers my whole life and this place this one of the best ones. 5☆<//Text>< username>

Dude was nice and polite but when I got home I noticed my cut still wasn't even. Called and explained, the girl told me to come back and they'd fix it for free. When I returned the dude I talked to said it would probably be better if I went to Adam. Adam did a great job fixing my hair, but they ended up charging me again. Would have given more stars except I feel like I shouldn't have to pay twice to get a good cut.< /review>

If you love waiting 3 hours to get your haircut come here! I sure hope these barbers never decide to become a firefighter... Just watched a guy take 1 hour to buzz someone's hair that was 1 inch long to begin with. If you don't have a beard now, you will once they call you up.</text>

<review>This is by far the best barbershop in the inland empire. I've been to a bunch and none of them seem to be able to get the precision that these guys can do. The fades and cuts are spot-on everytime. They tailor the cut style to your head. You can't just find that precision anywhere. I swear at least 3 X's a week someone asks me where I get my hair cut at. Go and try it out, find which barber that can work your cut to its best and don't forget to tip ;)<//review>< rate>

<text>By far the best run barbershop in So. Cal.  Adam and his staff have created a place where people can come and visit, relax, and get the most clean cuts around.  The time they take to make sure the style you want is acheived is phenomenal.  I have read others complain of the wait time, and let me say THE CUT IS WELL WORTH THE WAIT.  The environment is relaxed and the shop is set up very well.  For the price and quality you will not find a better shop.  Every barber in the shop knows what they are doing.  If you are looking for a stress free place that you can call home for your haircuts, this is the place.

<Text>Want your hair cut by someone who knows what they're doing, custom cuts is the bees knees.
Tired of going to fantastic Sam's and choosing a hair style from a book of 90's magazine articles?
Does the 40yr+ ladies angrily wash your hair like you've been walking on their lawn?
Does it feel like you're getting scalped for a buffalo nickle when they comb your hair!?

Stop all that bullshit and head to custom cuts.
Great vibes
Great atmosphere
Treated with the upmost respect upon entering their establishment.
I couldn't recommend this place enough.</Text>< rate>

In conclusion if you love short hairstyles like fades this is a good place to go..... if you don't then don't bother going.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<rate>1</rate><Text>The first time I went to this place was great. But today was my 2nd time going and I got there at 6:30pm and wasn't seen till about 7pm witch is fine. But when I got to the chair the guy asked if I just walked in I replied no I got here at 6:30 he said we do not take walk-ins after 6:30 I told him I could leave and come back tomorrow he said no ill take you just remember no more walk-ins after 6:30pm so I said ok. He was rushing and pushing the Clippers into my head and neck. My hair cut came out uneven and wasn't worth the 20 dollars they charge for a cut. There were people getting there hair cut before I started to get mine and I was done before any of them. Probably wont be going back to them.< /Text>< pics>

<review>When I got there the gal gave a very very nice cut & straight razor finsh. The next guy good cut. I let her know I was in a rush & had to get out asap. Waited a hour plus. They really take care regulars. She even offerd for me to come back later to fix anything. Very Cool but, I don't live around.. so I could the full teatment.  Bad ; waitting, she didn't understand how I want the cut, clipper dull could feel the pull on my hairs. But did get a turbo cut & a new person discount 12 bucks. Thank you for trying hard.<//review>< Response>

They are so much more detailed and thorough, in explaining what needs work, if there's any dental issues you may have than any dental office I've been in!! I had no idea since my last dentist was not as informative. They are great at putting patients as ease and friendly and courteous as well!!</review>

They were prompt, careful about Covid protections, friendly, detailed in their plans for the dental work I need, and considerate of the cost of major work. I feel very comfortable about being a patient there.

Just returned from a cleaning. I arrived 1 1/2 hours early by mistake, and they smiled and got me in. They are kind, sensitive to their patients, and very good at their jobs. It is a pleasure to have them on my team.< /review>

My memories about going to the dentist were never that great....

As a young child, I went to military dentistry. It didn’t matter how young or old you were; to those doctors the person sitting in the chair was treated like a soldier!

Then, as I got much older, I used to say I’d rather give birth than go to the dentist!

But, Dr. Meza and his team are wonderful. His technicians watch your body language and tell you to breath through your nose and relax. I don’t carry those fearsome experiences any more. Thank you Dr. Meza and staff.<//Review>

< Review>
I recently had to get my wisdom teeth removed and was very nervous about having it done. Luckily I found Bay Area Dental Office with the most amazing staff probably at any dentist office I’ve visited before. Friendly, kind and very skillful at what they do. This helped to ease my nerves about the procedure a lot. The actual process of getting my wisdom teeth removed was flawless with no pain at all. Can’t be more happy with the service that I’ve gotten from them. Thank you to Dr. Meza and his team! Will definitely recommend this dental office to anyone looking for an amazing dentist.< /Review>

Dr. Meza is a wonderful dentist.  He's very smart, and knows very well what needs to be done.  He's done a lot of "magic" for me and I'm extremely satisfied.  His stuff is also very friendly and very courteous.< /Review>

I have been going to Dr. Meza for years and he is wonderful.  I have had several crowns done and fillings and always feel satisfied.  He has always told me what needs to be done and given me the time to decide when, no pressure.  His staff is courteous and professional.  Highly recommend this Dental Office.</text>

<review>From the moment I walked in the door, I was greeted warmly and with a smile. The appointment was easy to schedule and they followed up with me before my appointment to ensure I didn't have any questions or concerns. After I filled out my paperwork, the staff notified me about a slight delay in getting me back in the room. Although once I was seen by Phillip (who is super kind and helpful) my cleaning went very well. He explained every step and checked in with me throughout my cleaning. When Dr. Melo came in, she was also very nice and did my exam with care and concern. She explained my teeth concerns to me with respect and candor. I'm hoping to make them my new dental provider as I am new to the area which is why I visited them through a Groupon deal. I know, I got great care and a wonderful cleaning on Groupon! Looking forward to my follow up appointments in the future! Thank you Bay Area Dental Office!<//review>< Pics>

This place was great--I recently transitioned over b/c I moved to San Jose and needed a good dentist in the area--found out my insurance covered this place so decided to check it out.  I called and was able to get an appointment for the next week (which is quite prompt)!  They accept all payment methods: cash, credit card, checks, etc. which is very convenient.

I received a teeth whitening as well as veneers and my smile looks AMAZING!  I received these services a month ago and my teeth are still sparkling white (and I drink a lot of coffee hah) and the veneers are still intact/look great.  Dr. Meza is very thorough, patient and easy to talk to--recommended!<//Review>

The worst experience I have ever had.  They wanted to add implants where I didn't need them. Even the hygienist told me that my teeth looked worst since I started with my braces. I would never recommend this place. They only want money. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼< /Review>

I had severely bleeding gums and the procedure (which included laser) took care of that! The rest now is up to me. I cannot thank Dr. Meza’s office enough!

I've been going for 3 years now and find the service excellent and at a reasonable price.   My teeth are very clean - you wouldn't know I was a smoker.The modern and clean layout of the surgery looks very professional. I like the booklets and leaflets for the patients which contain a lot of useful information! Great service.</Review>

Dr Meza and his team brought to the practice a new generation of technology, both in the office and in the dental chair: The paperwork and schedule reminders are efficient, and his practice of dentistry offers his patients greater comfort. Dr Meza and his assistants seem to choreograph from the same brain—so seamless and smooth. I am glad that Doctor Meza and his team took over the practice from the previous dentistry team. New technology is good.<//Review>

They treat very well, the problem is lack of honesty in this clinic. I went there and they told me a need a lot of improvement my dental . they wanted to charge me 4000 dollars . When I went to another dental office very honest I needed only 2 fills and the extractions its sad to tell this , when you have insurance is worse they charge them and the patient pays a lot of money without payment plans affordable. This is a honest robbery .<//text>

<Review>From the moment you enter the office, you are welcomed by the happy staff calling you by name,the waiting is very short  to start your visit,
The staff is well trained and Qualified,they ask your need and confort.
Dr. Meza is the Star to wrap up the whole visit by confirming that all your needs were met ,all questions are answered ,and new appointment is schedualed.
I definetely recomend this ofice and their quality of services for any one including the whole family.< /Review></record>

I have seen all three doctors, Dr. Melo, Dr. Meza, and Dr. Lofthus and they have all made me feel comfortable and have answered my questions thoroughly. It's clear that they are honest doctors and have a genuine interest in my health. At my last two visits, I had to have three fillings done, and the doctors assistants, Andrea and Rosario were very helpful and made sure I felt no pain. Dr. Meza also made sure to explain the x-rays and show me the before and after of the work they had done. He worked quickly, efficiently and did a wonderful job ensuring I was happy with the result.

I also have my cleanings done here, and both hygienists Ildiko and Sophia are also kind, and very careful when cleaning my teeth. Top it off, the front office staff greeted me immediately and was was very helpful in verifying my insurance coverage. Overall, I would highly recommend this office to all of my friends and family.<//review>< Pictures>

Dr.Meza, he is amazing, i have been going BADO since few years and i am really happy with their service specially their upfront cost representations. I have worked with other dental offices in bay area and some of them they start the job and half way thru completion they show you the bill in the middle and if you are paying out pocket thats no no. im glad Dr. Meza was all nice and informing me all the possibilities of solving my teeth issues. If you are paying out pocket or insurance holder, visit them and you will see what i am talking about. If you going for tooth whitening or cleaning ask them yelp special, they will give you good discount.</text>

<Text>Heena is just so amazing!! I'm not the type to just post on my own so she gave me very good directions on how to pose, when to pose and all that good stuff! She felt knows how to capture what your looking for. She is very patient, and hands on, and an amazing person! I would highly recommend her, the way she directs and captures angles are beyond this world! Would give her 10 STARS if it was available. Her rates are reasonable, and affordable!!! She also gives specials around the holidays 😁😁 Easy 10 out of 10 WOULD RECOMMEND!!!< /Text>< gmapID>

There aren't enough words to describe Heenas patience. I brought in my baby for a session and she did such a wonderful job at comforting her! From booking to the actual in-studio session was so easy. She makes you feel comfortable and really gives beyond a 5 star service. Already booked our cake smash session ! Definitely recommend her!</Text>

She is great photographer, extremely patient with all the questions, offered a variety of packages and my kid was 14 months and was tough but still was ok to do cake smash 1 year old theme. Less number of pictures offered in the package but the quality of work was worth it. Absolutely would recommend to some of my co workers and friends.<//Text>

<Text>We drove from AZ to do a beach maternity photoshoot with Heena. She was very responsive before and after the shoot. She was very accommodative, i even sent her some poses that i found online and sent to her. She did an amazing job capturing it with my 2 yr old and I. She was very patient with my kids. She is very easy to work with and would recommend her very much.< /Text><time>1623895305448<//time><response>None</response></record>

<text>I just received the final photos from our newborn shoot with Heena, and I am so pleased! Heena took such great care and attention getting the perfect shot with each setup that it was near impossible to narrow down our favorites. Her studio is well stocked with every possible prop you could want and she’s got a great eye for posing the baby is just the right way. I would definitely recommend her and will use her again in the future.< /text><user>116980442313189413164<//user></record></dataset><record>

<text>Heena did a beautiful job with our maternity photos! We began in her studio and then went to few outside locations in Poway that she recommended. She was so professional and knew exactly which angles worked for us. She recommended different poses that showed off my growing belly as well as various couple poses. The photos she captured show our personalities, love, and excitement for parenthood. We will cherish these photos forever! Thank you, Heena!<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNN5BFtxT4bgivu2AaXpROOa0vCK5mNk6iwwgzl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMD41o-CVQXlJsBw7HaKU23SJ_9J3ohR-CU6yyS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtW3Qr643wEo6oOnR-expCRtcz8-a0bWuQDiPL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6q7On3rJqXl20P5pM0IO1PoUF5aMgAyuuVs-0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

Very happy wth both my maternity photos and newborn photos through Shoot Through Studio.  Heena has a special talent for working with newborns.  She made me feel comfortable and relaxed at both shoots - especially the newborn photos and all the stress that comes with taking your baby out of the house for the first time.  Heena spent lots of time with us to achieve gorgeous shots!  She helped me chose Wind N Sea beach for my outdoor maternity photos and they turned out amazingly beautiful!  I recommend Shoot Through Studio.< /review>

Heena was a joy to work with! She is very professional, friendly and responsive. She answered all my questions in a timely manner and the day of the maternity photoshoot she did not disappoint! She had multiple maternity dresses to pick from and were ready, prepped by the time we arrived for the shoot. It was very nice for her to have props and the dresses on hand. Heena is very creative during the shoot as well! Highly recommend Heena for maternity and we cannot wait for the newborn.</Review>

I was researching on newborn photographers for a while. I reached out to Heena and she was very detailed in what was included in the package. I booked her last minute and she was able to squeeze me in. She was very patient with my newborn and very loving towards him. She made sure to ask me what type of photos I was interested in and I was soooo happy she was able to make the froggy pose happen! I am OBSESSED with the pictures. As she was taking the pictures, she showed me and made sure I was happy with them :) I am a VERY happy momma!</Text>

My wife did not get to take maternity photos for our first two, due to severe morning sickness all throughout, so we took advantage with this baby. Heena was a pleasure to work with, she was very patient and accommodating and gave good direction for a couple that had really no idea what we wanted. Most importantly her photos came out beautifully, and we're so happy to have these photos as fond memories.< /Review>

Our pictures turned out amazing, and our photographer, Heena, made the process so easy. Heena gave us tips on how to ensure a sleepy baby and it worked like a charm. Our pictures were also ready earlier than expected. Very satisfied!</Review>

My wife and I loved working with Heena! She did a fantastic job taking maternity photos. The photos came out gorgeous. My wife's mother (baby's grandma) nearly started crying when she saw the photos. We will be gifting her a large canvas print for mother's day.
Sometimes mamas can be nervous about showing off their bump. Heena was so nice, flattering, and accommodating. It made the whole process very easy and fun.
We can't wait to go back for newborn baby photos soon.<//Text>

Heena is so friendly and lovable. She makes you feel comfortable. I'm just loving our pictures from the photoshoot. We got to shoot at a wonderful location near her house and also in her nicely setup studio. We loved working with her and hopefully we get to work together on another project soon!!! I highly recommend her for your maternity photoshoot.< /Review>

We used maternity photography services from Heena Jain. She did amazing job. She suggested shoot location at La Jolla pier during golden hour. Pictures really turned out fantastic. She is very responsive to messages. Even though we booked at last minute as one of our friend is not able to make to San Diego due to COVID restrictions, she was able to accommodate us. I will definitely recommend her for maternity photography. We will definitely use her services for newborn 👶 shoot as well.

Thank you 🙏 Heena for capturing memorable moments so beautifully.<//Text>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>Heena is our go-to photographer for every major event. She did our maternity photoshoot, and our family photoshoot with our 2 month old. She was super-friendly and made my camera-shy family comfortable in front of the camera. I just love love love our photos from the maternity shoot. I just wish we had planned for more time for the family photoshoot, since we didn't have enough time to try any of the props or check photos to fix messy hair, etc. But Heena did her best to accomodate our constraints (with us being sleep-deprived zombie-looking parents of a newborn at that point). I would recommend her.<//Text>< name>

Heena is just superb with her work! While working with her on our maternity/ family photo session we found her to be knowledgeable and personable which helped us to relax and get some fantastic shots.
She is very creative,talented, energetic, meticulous about her work and always carries a pleasant smile.
She was extremely patient while working with my 3 year old and gave my little girl a good amount of time.
We had to reschedule our appointment due to an event at the location and she accommodated us with no issues.
I would definitely recommend and use her in future.</review>

You can see from the constant stream of Sneak Peaks on her page how many clients she has worked with and yet she provides a completely personalised service and you never once feel like you’re just another client. She makes sure to capture every moment in a stress-free fun way. And the results are just fantastic. The BEST photographer EVER! ❤< /Text>< pics>

Heena does great work! I went to both her studio and the beach for a maternity shoot and I’m in looove with the photos!

I’ll start with the studio. She has so many colors for the backdrop so she can make any colored outfit look amazing. I love the simplicity of white so my personal preference was the white backdrop. The photos looked great on her camera but once I got the edited photos I was amazed! I felt completely comfortable trying different outfits and poses with Heena.

The second location we shot at was wind and sea beach. These photos were my favorite because you can’t beat the beautiful backdrop of the sea. I trusted Heena’s direction and got some incredible shots!

If you’re looking for a maternity photographer, look no further!<//Review>

<Review>No matter how amazing we celebrate our party, without proper photographer the memories couldn't be cherished. Heena, was the one who made us to have those wonderful memories. Heena was our photographer at our daughter's 3rd birthday party and she was the best. She's patient, smart, professional and above all an awesome human. She's very gentle with the kids and captured finest details of the party.

Heena's approach of blending with our family and capturing the candid moments was exactly what we were looking for. The shoot yielded absolutely beautiful shots and all of our family members and friends loved them. Through out the party her suggestions helped us.

She is super responsive over texts and calls and provided our photos way ahead of schedule. She also has sent us sneak peak in 2 days with family and birthday girl's pics. In person, Heena is really kind and friendly and our 3 year old was immediately comfortable around her.

Finally, we couldn't have had this awesome experience without Heena, and we definitely would recommend her.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dbfa04c77e9fe3:0x6dea2e97ca9c1fd3<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Heena is a great and friendly photographer.  She is very professional and has a good eye for detail. My sister and I enjoyed our photo shoot with her because she made us feel at home.<//text>

Heena was very patient with our kids and knows how to make it stress free for the parents. Her studio is very cute and has all sorts of backdrops and props to choose from. I would highly reccomend shooting right in her studio if you have little kiddos like me. We got to change outfits and backgrounds all without a fuss!!</text>

Heena was very professional and has  so much experience which is exactly what I needed.  I am a model who was needing to update my portfolio with some edgy, more high fashion and artistic shots.  I like how organized she was the entire time I talked to her, even before the photoshoot.  She shot a variety of shots so I now have traditional headshots and edgier full body poses.  She gave some very helpful constructive criticisms about my poses to make sure the shots looked perfect.  I'm very excited about expanding my modeling career now that I have these pictures in my portfolio!  I would definitely recommend her to anyone!<//text>

Heena is an amazing photographer. She is so wonderful to work with and accommodating. She made me feel like a super model the entire time we were shooting. I love how patient she is, she made sure my fiancé and I got every shot that we wanted. I would highly recommend working with Heena, I can't wait for us to do a studio shoot together! Book Heena! You will not regret it.< /review>

<Review>Great crepe cake as always! The green tea is the gold standard, or the original, or the season special. The Chestnut has just a hint of sweet Chestnut, but still creamy and absurdly smooth. The cakes are not good, waste of money. Stick to the crepe cakes!

<Review>Such a fun little place to visit for an aesthetically pleasing and delicious ice cream. I got the bunny in rose lemonade flavor after trying several flavors- it was a hard debacle between tiramisu and rose lemonade. The toppings were made of marshmallows and candy, which I thought was a bit too sweet.< /Review></record>

<rate>1</rate><Review>This place is very overrated. I actually don't understand why this place is so popular. I had three different cakes with my friends and they were all very disappointing. Even if they were $3 I would not go back and buy them. What makes it worse is that they're $8. My friends and I had a good laugh because they taste like the cakes that we would get from a Chinese bakery, so I guess that was a positive.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPwkZlFbrgyFAiyl3YMpoj_8tK5yqci64-G9a1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2XSrHzClgXtUC0Hzmz7oTbfh3IwXuKmdqKYt5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

I was there 2 days ahead to order the cake for my mom's birthday.  The staff said I was there half an hour late to place the order (4:30pm instead of 4pm) cause they don't take order after 4pm.  I understand if that's their rule but the manager didn't have to be rude and gave me the ugly attitude.  Never go back again!!!< /review>

She refused to hold our cake for half an hour and was extremely defensive in the way she stated the exact number of birthday candles per cake purchased.  I would not bother coming here ever again, I’d much rather travel further afield to the branch at Irvine where the staff are much nicer.</Review>< pictures>

Love that Lady M Cake Boutique is conveniently located inside Santa Anita Mall.

We decided to pick up a few cakes from here to celebrate Lunar New Year and my dad's birthday. We chose the matcha and the seasonal red bean mille crepe cakes.

The presentation at Lady M is simple, clean and elegant. We love the simplicity of their cakes and the depth of the flavors. You can buy whole cakes and slices. If you are going to buy whole cakes, make sure you go earlier during the day as they run out fast.

My all-time favorite mille crepe cake is the matcha. It's full of matcha flavor, slightly sweet that complements the matcha flavor. The top of the cake is dusted with more matcha powder. If you are a big matcha lover like me, this is the cake you will want to get.

The seasonal red bean mille crepe cake had the cream from their original mille crepe cake along with red bean paste and red bean.

Keep in mind that the prices of cakes tend to be on the high side, Lady M Cake Boutique is definitely a splurge.<//Review>

< Review>
We purchased a cake from this location a week ago and while we love your cakes, we did not appreciate the attitude the staff gave us during our visit. We bought a 9" signature Mille Crepe cake from this location. We were going to see a movie at that time and kindly requested the staff to hold our cake until the end of the movie; the supervisor refused and said that they do not have space in their refrigerator. i find this hard to believe because they literally just took it out of it. Not only did she lie to my face, she insulted my intelligence by saying this. it was noon at the time, we were only asking them to hold the cake for only 2 hours but we had no choice but to take the cake to the movie with us knowing it will go bad if we do so. and alas, once we got home, the cake was not at all presentable nor edible anymore. I just wasted $85 which was supposed to be for my mom's birthday.< /Review>

The cake shop is now open and I highly enjoy it.Sometimes there is larger lines but I got there with short wait early in the morning.I enjoy the green tea mille crepes and the original cake is decent.This is a great place to go if you would like to purchase a tasty crepe cake.< /review>

This pop up boutique is now more active and isn't closed anymore.It is really good and the crepes are high quality.The prices are around 55 dollars and the cakes are worth it.They have about six flavors and my favorite is the green tea mille crepes.I highly suggest this place for anyone who would like a crepe cake anytime.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The taste is not bad, but to be honest, the price increase is quite ridiculous. It used to sell a cake for $48 when it first opened, but now it sells for $90😱. . . Really exaggerated

(Original)
味道还不错，但是说实话价格涨的比较离谱了。以前刚开业时卖$48一个的蛋糕，现在卖到$90😱。。。真的挺夸张的</review>

(Translated by Google) Fortunately, I could n’t give a negative star. My wedding anniversary on 3-27 happened to be my daughter ’s birthday too. I was afraid that the cake would be delayed. I purposely advanced the delivery date two days, that is, the 25th. I told the customer service that someone told me that next Wednesday, April 1st may arrive. Am I giving birth to a daughter or are I getting married once? Last year I ordered a birthday cake for my wife, and I was late, (it seems that I did n’t deliver it at all). Things are delicious, and that's not how you treat customers' capital like this. So remind everyone, set it early, do n’t delay things, you ca n’t send them out, not necessarily. Fortunately, I can't give a negative star. My wedding anniversary on 3-27 happened to be my daughter 's birthday too. I was afraid that the cake would be delayed. So I change the delivery date by two days early, , that is, on the 25th. today 26th I talk to the customer service that the cake not here yet, they told me that next Wednesday, April 1st, it might arrive. and I ordered the cake on 16th. It was late for my wife 's birthday cake last year, never had it arrive. cakes are good but that's not your capital for treating customers like that. So remind everyone, make it early, so it will not delay.

幸好我不能给负星， 我3-27号结婚纪念日正好也是女儿生日， 我怕蛋糕耽误事， 特意把收货日期提前两天， 也就是25号到， 结果， 今天26号还没到， 跟客服说， 人家告诉我下周三， 4-月1号可能到， 我是在生个女儿啊还是在结一次婚啊？去年给太太定生日蛋糕， 就迟到了， （好像压根就没发货）。东西是好吃， 那也不是你们这样对待客户的资本。所以提醒大家， 都早点定吧， 别耽误事， 发不发货， 不一定啊。Fortunately, I ca n’t give a negative star.

Then he makes it seem like he is doing you a favor. I think they should be called the no zone. This is just one mans experience at the wheel zone.

<date>1619565273683<//date><Review>I called twice to ask if they could remove a stripped bolt from my 3 pc wheels, they hung up on me the first time, second time they said just bring it down. I drove 40 min south to be told they would drill it out in which I replied would destroy the threads in the barrel (OZ 3pc so bolt threads into barrel), was then told they would drill just the head.. ok so what about the bolt shank? Long story short in under two minutes he got annoyed and told me it’s not worth my time or money go else where. The company site states they do many different wheel repairs but are stumped by a bolt? No thanks.<//Review>< user>

Over priced from owner, $20 for a simple valve replacement
Employees where great but owner was not.

BEST TIRE SHOP IN SAN DIEGO!
Fast service! Amazing quality tires/rims and BEST PRICING I’ve found in San Diego. Recommend getting your tires here! I’ve been coming here for years and haven’t found a tire shop better than The Whee Zone.<//review>

<review>The owner is extremely rude and a liar... My husband called to inquire about some tires on Monday April 27th , he said he had the ones he needed in stock. My husband then asked him if he was willing to hold the tires till Friday April 1st, he said no problem, and my husband asked twice if he was OK with waiting and said of course, and he took his number and told him see you Friday. We were very excited to get the tires for a great price! But when we got there.. He said he sold them! I would give them no stars but it doesn't let you. DON'T DO BUSNIESS HERE!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Provided me an overpriced quote to repair a small curb rash when an associate of mines just paid $35.00 to repair his curb rash which were in worse condition then the rims on my car and both my associate and I have same size rims (20 inch).  It sad when majority companies always tried to take advantage of customers especially when they see him/her pull up in a high luxury car. Stay away would be my advice!<//text>

< Review>
Horrible customer service, i went there hoping to get 2 sets of tires for my cars but it did not go well. The owner is not friendly at all, he does not answer questions, lies about inventory, gives out different prices depending on his mood and adds extra charges out of no where. Very bad experience never going back there again.< /Review>

<userid>111045663561988747525< /userid><Review>They’re all in a hurry... In a hurry to make money so if they do something as simple as torque the lug nut for your wheels, they’re going to mess it up because they’re careless and in a hurry. If you’re looking for a shady place to give you shady service, you’ve found it!  You’ll definitely get a discount but you’ll pay for it later when you have to fix up the mess they made... especially if that young, fat guy messes with your wheels. The whole group of guys working seem like they have got lots to talk about other than concentrating on your vehicle.</Review><Response>None<//Response><pictures>None< /pictures><gmap_id>0x80d94c1f2fee8c41:0x3564145e87ee0dbe<//gmap_id><time>1582005798623<//time><rate>1< /rate></record>

<review>During a rainy night around 6pm I drove up to the place with the lights on and doors open and asked where was a good place to park my vehicle, they jokingly said "the street", meaning I should leave their establishment because they were closed. They didn't even bother to tell me if I could get help anywhere else. Terrible encounter, I thankfully didn't stay to get any service.</review>< rating>

Been coming here for over 20 years. Danny has always treated me with dignity and respect. His prices are always better than any competitor. Highly recommend.</review>

Bad customer service....I waited 2 hours to get  4 used tires put on!! Not once did anyone say sorry for the wait or thank you for your patience! The place has no comfortable place to sit while you wait for service to be done. Will never go there again!<//review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><review>Stay away from this place unless you plan to buy wheels. I came in for a flat tire fix which I believed stemed from my aftermarket wheels that were recently installed. I left with a pair of used run-flat tires which did not resolve my TPM sensor fault. I came back and the owner/manager (?) said they couldn't do anything without a receipt, even though I'm sure he recognized me. One of his technicians even recognized me; we greeted each other with a nod. Long story short, this grumpy manager charged me $10 for a tire check and threatened to charge me $20 because I used my debit card... I have no idea who pee'd in his Cheerios, however I do know that I'll never spend my money at this place, ever again. Stay away! Unprofessional management and practices! 2 stars only because the used tires were really cheap.<//review>< Date>

If I could give NO stars I would.  Apparently Wheel Zone didn't plug the hole in my tire properly and the owner of wheel zone refuse to fix my tire after I informed him that my tire was leaking air and I don't want the tire to go flat on me with my 9 month old daughter in car. Very unprofessional and very rude. The owner didn't take the time to look at my tires.  He said no and that's it. at the time my tire PSI was 24. The tire was leaking air fast. Not sure if it's because I'm a woman, but he was being condensing, and very rude. Good thing I found another tire shop around the corner called Jeff's. I went to Jeff and they were prompt and professional. Jeff showed me the craapy plug wheel zone put into my tire and showed me the leak. Jeff will get my business from this day forth. Dont spend your money with those Crooks at wheel zone. They don't keep records of the services they perform on your vehicle, and they lost the key to my wheel lock.< /review>

<Text>Been coming here for years. They do things you cant really get done anywhere else. I read the other reviews and well all i can say is its not your normal wheel shop. But if you know what you want or need a deal on some used tires then come here. Dannyy is an interesting kinda guy, being in this biz you deal with a lot of window shoppers and people that waste your time so when you own the place you tend to have a little guard up. Understand its a niche business and its open to make money not to please %100 of the market. They will do whats necessary to do what most other shops wont even attempt. In the end. 17 yrs later i still come here.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>I have used the wheel zone for over 10 years, I highly recommend this shop. Danny and Alberto have always provided excellent client service to our families and friends vehicles. Their prices and labor fees are fair. If your looking for a powdercoated frame off restoration to wheel polishing  restoration, or any suspension needs talk to Danny or Alberto, they are both extremely knowledgeable and provide you with solutions to any project your working on. On two different ocassions while waiting for work to be completed, service wheel technicians from a nationally known wheel and tire facility came in from up the block to ask Danny if he had specific parts they couldn't find. Hope this is helpful to people who appreciate excellent customer service and quality work.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Text>Worst service!!! the older man with grey hair which i believe is the owner always with the worst attitude trying to make people feel less in my experience and a friend of mine experience the same treatment. I was planing to go get some rims with them. But with custormer service like that i much rather spend my money else where. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Very unhappy with them. They pulled a bait and switch scam on me. They had an ad on Offerup for  a set of Hankook 285/75/16 used tires  .  The ad claims that the tires are like new and have 95% tread left, so I called up the shop to confirm that they still have them.  I showed up to the store after one hour (40 miles one way).  The salesman showed me tires that are cracked and have under 40% tread, so when I asked him about the 95% tread set of tires, he said that he sold them, and he tried to sell me new tires.<//review>

Worst shop ever. I was sold defective tires and they wanted me to leave my car at home for a week bring th my rims. Pay them 40 to remove tires to send back to factory wait to hear back and charge me another 40 to put the tires on the rims. No mount or balance. Mind u the tires cost 109.00 so I will almost pay the cost of new tires just to put tires off and on. And they did not know what they were talking about at all. They should shut down.< /text>

<text>Probably the worst customer service I've ever had at a business. They never once called me to give me an update on how the wheel repair was going. I had to always call them. Every time I called they would tell me it would be ready in a few days and when I called back a few days later it was never ready and would be a few more days. I drove to the shop at least 4-5 times trying to pick up the wheel when they said it would be ready. Owner is grouchy and very defensive. I would take your business elsewhere.<//text><gmapID>0x80d94c1f2fee8c41:0x3564145e87ee0dbe<//gmapID>< username>

I thought I had found my go to place for wheels and tires, I like always having good wheels and tires everytime. This place seemed to fit after spending 1800 dollars on wheels and Hankook performance tires for my 2004 gto they fit perfect, he did say they wouldn't rub but surprise! They rub, no biggie just adjusted the suspension higher and avoid rubbing. Cool. So now my jeep I went here again for some tires I ended up getting Pirelli Scorpion MTR's for my jeep, they fit very tight because of the big size but I didn't mind because I was soon to lift it. We'll i got my lift kit and again went to these guys for the install the owner said ok and seemed happy to take on the job, I waited outside and after the owner passed on the word to his workers they all started cursing saying it was a Saturday they were trying to get done, whatever I didn't mind it I've been there too so I walked across the street to stores to kill time after an hour and 30 minutes of waiting I get a call and they tell me they aren't going to be able to do it today to come back another day.. I was really pissed off because I called before I got there to make sure they would be able to do it. Again whatever I blew it off, the Pirelli MTR's I had got from them didn't last long due to my personal fault and not getting an alignment, whatever I knew it was my fault and owned up to it. 6 months later I decide I'm gonna replace them already another 500 something in Pirellis again, so I call the owner again and tell him if he remembers me he said yes by this time the lift kit was already instead by some other company and just needed the tires again, he agreed and told me that those specific tires they weren't selling anymore because of blow outs and the company didn't have them so he couldn't order them, so he called local warehouses and surprisingly they had all 4 that they would be in Monday. Cool went Monday installed them got the alignment and done! He gave me a receipt and said if anything under factory warranty happens come back and I'll help you out with the issue, like a blow out for example I said ok. No more problems, 3 months later I have friends in the car telling thay it feels more bumpy on passenger side for some reason I didn't pay attention and shrugged it off. One day I'm cleaning the wheels and tires after a wash and notice a buldge with a crack not on the threads but in between the threads on the actual tire wich was very dangerous I immediately knew I was playing with fire on a lifted car and a blow out anytime soon. So I go back to the owner since I'm there alot with expensive tastes. So today I go back, I go inside and see the owner and speak to him directly and tell him about it, his response that's impossible those tires no way. I said yeah dude and remember you told me about the problem and how you were actually able to aquire them since they were discontinued for that reason. Instead of working with me he immediately got his guard up and said well I can't help you without the receipt, and I said ok it's in the car but don't you want to look at the tire atleast and he said I have to have a receipt. I said ok so I go to the jeep and don't find the receipt in glove box and I go back and politely let him know that apparently I don't have the receipt but that he knows who I am and he says yeah I know I remember. But as soon as he found out that I had no receipt the tables flipped he said he never said that, that he would never say things like that, that he doesn't know where I got that from but he would never say that and that the tire was a road hazard that it had to be a pot hole, on some big Pirelli MTRs yup a pothole was his answer so I didn't even bother arguing I said alright cool you can't do anything for me wasting eachothers time I remembered him that I had spent over 3k with him in less than a year and he can't even bother looking into one tire? What kind of service and professionalism was that anyway I left very upset and this did it told him I would give him the worst and most honest review about this situation. Not recommended.<//text>

<Date>1462124057284<//Date><Text>It saddens me deeply that we live in a world where people expect instant gratification and can no longer handle someone being honest and blunt. Danny is just that, but hes more than fair, which is why I keep going back. Need repairs to a special wheel? They can do it. Need to find something you havent had luck finding before? They can find it. Will it take some time? Yes, but if you've been searching and you really want it whats a little more waiting going to hurt you?
I ordered wheels for my truck which was brand new on the market. No one had wheels with my bolt pattern. Danny drilled out a set on the spot but couldnt find hubcentric rings to work with the new wheels so they made it right. What more can you ask for?
If you think these guys are "grumpy" or "rude" I would take a look in the mirror before passing judgement. You get what you give. Hes always more than friendly with me. Joking. Laughing. I'll keep giving these guys my business as long as they're around.</Text><pics>None< /pics><gmapID>0x80d94c1f2fee8c41:0x3564145e87ee0dbe</gmapID><name>Brent York</name><resp>None<//resp></record>

< review>
Clark is responsive to competing concerns:  using the least toxic materials to get the job done, and keeping armies of Argentine ants out of my home, (with apologies to Argentina, a lovely country.) If you've ever seen crumbs of food pulsing with ants or followed a trail into cupboards to find an infestation requiring throwing away anything not in cans, you will value regular service from Clark.  Since I began the contract, there have been no problems and they are careful about where they spray outside, avoiding fruit trees and vegetable planters. Peace of mind:  call them and they come over to address the issue, explaining their work clearly and answering questions. They establish outside perimeters the ants don't cross.< /review>

My family has done business with Clark Pest Control for over sixteen years.  We have been pleased with their services.  The technicians are knowledgeable and friendly.  If there is ever a problem Clark sends out someone to take care of it right away.  I would recommend their services to everyone.<//Text>

Logan Cullan-best ever!!! We’ve been customers for years and recommend Clark to all of our family and friends.
If anyone is looking for a great pest control company, Clark is the best. We actually tried a different company for a month. After they came, the spiders and ants all moved in. I called Clark immediately!
No more problems.<//text>

<review>I have had the pleasure of having Torrance here. He is so incredibly thorough, kind and knows the business. He takes his time, and looks both inside and outside the house. He always calls to let me know if he is running late. He is a very pleasant and intelligent person.

He is the consummate professional and a major asset to Clark.

The service does a good job of keeping ants and spiders to a minimum, esp. inside the house.   The technicians are respectful and do their work quickly and unobtrusively.  If you call for special needs, you get a real person on phone right away. Free periodic termite inspection is a nice bonus.< /Text>

They are professional, knowledgeable and friendly.  I haven't had a serious bug problem in years.  We have a couple of fruit trees in our yard and when the bugs move in Clark moves them back out.
I highly recommend their service.<//review>

We've used Clark for many years, and have only experienced minor indoor pest (ant) problems a couple of times.  And when there is an issue, Clark is very responsive and comes out right away (within a day in our case) to provide some additional treatment, and the problem has gone away.  I would not use anyone else for pest control.<//text>

<text>I have used Clark pest control in Livermore for extended periods of time. Today I had Joshua smith inspector come to my home and he did an excellent inspection pointed out areas that he fixed so the future problems will be minimal or none. I was very happy with the service and highly recommend choosing Clark pest control in Livermore !

She was serviced by someone from corporate who placed outside poison containers in her yard. My main concern was that a rodent of some kind
got into my house while I was carrying my groceries through my back door.
Till this  day the critter remains in my home. The outside spraying seems adequate. Recently there have been mice found on my back porch. There has not been any placement of anything outside of my home to deter or kill the rodents that are occuring recently.<//Review>< pictures>

I hate having bugs in the home so the 1st call I made when I purchased my home in 2005 was to Clark Pest Control.  I was a regular customer with them before and was familiar with their service plans. I schedule a bimonthly plan with them and continue to be a satisfied customer.</text>

Any and every time I've called with a concern it is addressed immediately. Michael has been my regular guy since we've started service a couple years ago. He is always extremely professional, kind and courteous. He takes the time to answer all my questions. And the very very rare occasion he doesn't have an answer, he will find it immediately.</text>

<Name>Tobias Spade<//Name><review>Clark is very good about billing & collecting, and they are punctual however they have been unable to rid the house of common spiders and other small bugs.
We do have a large yard with a lot of trees and shrubs, however either the product being used is not working very well or they simply are not spending the time needed to do a good job.
I will most likely be canceling this service.</review>< Pics>

<text>Clark Pest in Livermore has always provided us with excellent customer service.  We have asked them to come back in between visits and they are always prompt and flexible.  We have ant problems and each visit from Clark includes a through search for colonies.  We are very happy with Clark's service and highly recommend them.< /text>< pictures>

<text>Clark delivered as promised - quickly! Other companies were not available as quickly as Clark. The service professional explained everything about the service then proceeded to handle the flea infestation. It took several applications, but we are finally rid of the bugs. My tenant is happy and I am happy! You might find a less expensive service, but you won't find a better one.< /text><Rate>5</Rate></record>

< review>
I like that Clark was able to trap gophers in my yard. Also like the preventative measures used, such as plugging holes, keeping critters from entering my home.  Technicians also sweep the exterior of my home free of spider webs and other insects each time they come.</review>

Kelly is a great bartender, the green felt tables are all in fantastic condition, two quarter tables are for challenges, and there's darts, a great sound system, and a really friendly atmosphere.</Text>

<gmapID>0x808565bf38bc4b2f:0x316fe48b2a86f60<//gmapID><review>If you don't know how to drink and you like to get drunk and stupid and fight this is your bar. If you're a little bit more mature than that it's probably not your bar. It seems like only the friends of the bartender can go in here. They also don't like any kind of service dogs or dogs at all. I used to think this was a great bar. Then they hired a certain bartender who seems to have taken it over For the worst. I've lived here 50 years and I've known this bar since it opened and I was there the other day and I'm so ashamed of it. It used to be a great place. But now it just seems to be for the young and dumb. I never give bad reviews this is probably the first bad review I've ever given so don't think I use this as a whipping post. this is all absolutely true. This Bar has gone Big Time downhill and the stuff is old inside it smells. It smells bad. it used to be a bar where mature people could go and enjoy themselves and relax. Until they rehired the bartender that seems to be there most of the time now it seems to be his far I wonder if the owner knows this. Only seems to be friends of his in there and knows people are the kind of people that don't know how to drink and Acton bars. Not like most mature people do. There's always exceptions to that rule.

I asked the bartender if he knew how to make a lavender martini, he didn't but he looked it up on Google and made me one, adjusting it til I loved the flavor.  Great Service!  The interior is cute and cozy.  There are several seats at the bar as well as tables and chairs.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808565bf38bc4b2f:0x316fe48b2a86f60< /gmapID></record>

<Text>The service here was horrible.. the brunette heavier set female working (didn't state her name) was rude, insensitive, and unreasonable. She was almost happy to have to tell my friends and I to leave when one of us didn't have their I.D. on them so (they called home where she left it) instead showed her a photo and a video on FaceTime of it.  Need I mind u we were totally willing to not purchase alcohol if that's wat this was about that we mainly wanted to play pool..(and she only asked once at this point) ALmost immediately this woman went from 0-100 I mean real quick completely  confrontational demanding we leave NOW. Like extremely embarrassing, it was tacky, and unprofessional, my friends and I will no longer come here and we do frequently venture here because they have a lot of pool table and so it's a shame. but the fact she made a huge fuss about an I. D. that she WAS able to be confirmed even though we all are CLEARLY In our 30s... was a huge let down, this is not ur " friendly neighbor BAR" that's for sure. Ur just a number here.<//Text>< pics>

I go here a lot! It's a great place to play pool and kick it with your friends. The bartenders can make a mean drink and are very friendly. There is one Security Guard there who is rude and short with people, but besides him I would definitely recommend this place.</Text>

Great local bar. Touch tunes juke box. Pool tables. Friendly staff, makes you feel like family. Beer selection is good and prices are reasonable. Like to go here during the day because the by hour pool costs are a bit cheaper. Good place for catching up with friends and family.</text>

< Review>
My Subway account was fraudulently used at this location about a week ago. I have been trying to call the store for days and days and nobody ever picks up. You have to call the gas station for someone to answer. The manager Alina I spoke with was very nice and empathic but unfortunately the situation is not yet resolved as this is in the owner's hands and he has yet to contact me to clear the issue. Very disappointed.< /Review>

I work the graveyard shifts and the three times I’ve been here to order a sandwich, the woman says they’re closed but it’s 24 hour service. I was walking away and I turned around to ask for the managers name because i thought it was very weird and the rookie there was swinging a little happy dance that I was leaving. The woman got angry and said “exactly what I said, were closed!” I felt disrespected and I promise I will not return to this Valero Subway on Union avenue. They don’t wash their hands either after handling cash. Thumbs down.<//text>

< Review>
Went in on 11/3/17 and had horrible customer service. I usually always go to this subway but today the two people that I usually never see were goofing around, complaining saying there tired, giving customers weird answers and not even paying attention to me on my order. The first one that started my meal by asking what kind of bread was super nice and on it, including the cashier girl. I don’t think it’s safe having a team member toss a knife to the other team member.. I think the girl who was joking name was margarita or something like that..</Review>

I love this place I go there any chance I get I'm vegan and get 9 grain bread and they have avocado and you build your own sandwich and it doesn't matter how much stuff you get except avocado that's extra but I don't care it's salivating every time I think of subway😍</Text>

<text>They have hands down everything you would be looking for in a supply store. Even things you didn't intend to go in for. I always find more than I come in for here. The staff is friendly and extremely helpful, the prices are fair and sometimes better than other places.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVLrBrZNJpTyjygHnviJNt2S3JsLUEIEcAbquO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuC3Q9kHW3oa3c_skbEYNtwAzWdIh1tEnFOAtl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPugUiWX9tAl5jYq1wfbWYhwwkVUMCrLxv_wlEB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgeuyqclSVldQtSsksp6aPVWrlaqPW5DPXPEeP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8QvSJiVVlr6vfHvpNxkyXmf7-YtaB6cgPSrXi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7E3YLSyXWUgzTDglyGJzxsH_WkZ7nOjVbES6R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnufgsptiXPxk4DwxmJMCsY2BTxPSqBy_7yS_d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4uF00a03yV194jkzuiqy3-uYnXPh-yBankz15=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbtqh7mouWV8EwlLIL_R6NIuDRiiKUxjOshjjo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDyTNKZqCc_oL5Olac_BO9brASl_jtDadmvvS5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNog6FdLzD2zclN8CJXogJRRFLUyzKuZb6zuupg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFiG0IVLZKedp9oQ1QFKBJqnexorQp2MZrJW0S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtkqMDVZ9DM7jXSGyHCYqsz0rHJ7zPdYuNsDCV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMB1w1xOCxgyFxRk7M9dzBKRCy67vmxp74vNUsB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgRdy5suvsPYf8fDx3j8ZDtbjt9RxH3vsYYp32=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6heOuGkmnuZQiLx7LJD2os1q4y-ChnTj-Ih7E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcWnDhHQeruLvNKK_jcjg2ohORxkqCsIrWLBzM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

Although they have a Lot of items, they no longer carry the boots my husband had gotten there for years. I know why, but that doesn't help me as I definitely needed those. That is the only reason I only gave them 2 stars. :(</review>

<review>Best Outdoor Enthusiast Store Around !
I love this store -- they've been a local staple since 1967. A military surplus, outdoor enthusiast store. You'll find knives, utility clothing and shoes, mountain climbing gear, other outdoor gear, sleeping bags etc., freeze dried food, and just about anything else you would need to be a survivalist! I highly recommend!!!<//review>< gmap_id>

Been going there since I was a boy, the employee's know me and my family by sight. Always friendly and helpful, got my first pair of Smith and Wesson cuffs there.
Their military surplus selection has yielded some rare gems to my collection,  for people who do things like wasteland weekend this place is a must see.

I always joked with the workers that there is always the biggest rush in the store after an earthquake or similar.

This place is where I did a lot of my "zombie apocalypse" prepping. The current pandemic is anti-climatic at the moment. Still thanks to places like this when it started I didn't really need to leave my apartment for a month unless I wanted to or had some where I really needed to be in person.<//Text>

< review>
I am in my late 40's now, and while growing up in Pomona in the 80s as a young boy playing army, this place was a staple for me and all my friends. I don't live in California anymore, but in all my travels I have yet to find a surplus store that comes close to M&I. I am happy to see they are still there, and I will put this place on the short list to visit when I come back someday.  Thanks for the memories!!</review>

They have some pretty cool stuff here but it's over priced and a lot of there stuff is cheap knockoffs especially the newer stuff made in China. I picked up a compass that was around $24 and I said to myself why? Because I knew it was overpriced. Found the same one on amazon for under $10.</text>

Disappointed that they didn't carry patriotic face masks. More like a junkie version of a post Korean war leftovers store. I was sorry I made the trip.< /text>

This place has been around as long as I can remember when I was young I would get my fatigues from here for the young marines I go now for all the great stuff they have. Check them out they have some great camping stuff.</review>

This place is cool and you can find ALL KINDS of old military stuff. Like, I'm talking about uniforms, ammo tanks, tents, camping freeze-dried food, pins, etc etc. This place seems to have everything, and it's a cool place for an early-in-the-relationship date, or on a we've-been-dating-two-years-and-we-haven't-checked-that-place-out-in-a-while kind of date. Also a great place if you're thinking of authentic Halloween costumes< /Review>

I went there to buy my dad some stuff since he is an army veteran, the girl who helped me was excellent! She told me how her father is a veteran as well and showed me the things that he likes to wear! Very nice store with a bunch of different things to look at. Someday I will bring my dad in so he can see how awesome it is.</review>

If you've never been just go. They have so many different items for sale, I always come out with something cool. Let it be a knife, backpacking frame backpack, or an iron skillet I always leave happy. Large selection of international military surplus clothes. Bought a great "Russian" looking warm hat for a fishing trip in Alaska too.< /Text>

Great.  Staff was helpful in offering assistance in locating right sizes.  Cashier who was owner's son was friendly.  Was in and out within 20 minutes.  Enjoyed shopping there for Christmas presents.</text>

< review>
This is a military surplus store. Lots of cool things. They carry military Uniforms, boots, camping equipment, survival gear and survival rations and a whole lot of other things. This is a great store to take all day and browse through. If you go to this store in the summer go early because they  just use fans to cool done the place. It can get pretty hot in the store during the summer.<//review>

I buy my belts here every few years, they are the best quality and they last.  I stopped in last night to pick up some Marine Corps gear for a gift and my expectations were exceeded. I bought pins for Marines as well as Vietnam vets.<//review>

<Text>This place is awesome!  They have new and used military items, including but not limited to, backpacks, canteens, patches, clothing and various surplus supplies.  The staff is extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  It's actually a cool place to take your kids so they can look around and get ideas of what it's like to be in the service.  They also have stuff for camping and fishing that are non-military related.</Text>< Rating>

This place is awesome. Lots of military used and new products/equipment. They had outside camo netting with spreaders. I purchased  the tru spec tactical trousers and a new vest with various compartments for carry and quick release. Lots of used equipment and gear at cheap prices and lots of product to select from. If your former military like me you will love this place. Everything from each branch of service. Just visit the place I guarantee you will buy something.</text>

<text>Lots of stuff here for reasonable prices. There is some high quality knives I wouldn't need but there are TONS of durable and inexpensive bags and apparel available. Also if it's up your alley there's a lot of old military gear. Hence it being a "Surplus" store.< /text><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

This is such a cool shop I had no idea existed. I needed some stuff for a Halloween costume, and they had everything I needed for very cheap. Aside from that there's tons of cool war memorabilia, and many different tactical surplus items for the average outdoorsman, or even home defense.<//Text>

Good sized store with a decent mix of both new and actual surplus items. The only thing that could be better is if they'd label more of their surplus items, a lot is unmarked except for price, it would be nice to know the country of origin of non-US items.<//review>

This is the best military surplus store around. If you need anything like military t-shirts for Father's Day, camping Goods, survival gear, durable duffle bags, historical war memorabilia, meals ready to eat and Doomsday prepper stuff this place has it. The staff is all great, the location is perfect (between the 10 and the 210) and they always have parking.< /text>

It is always a pleasure coming to this store. I picked up a i1mm mortar can for my 12ga ammo and when I cracked it open you could hear the air entering the can because it had a great seal to it. Yes I would say things there can be pricy but you are getting the face to face transaction. The encounter of people to me make the difference.

I will continue to use them for certain things until they end up shutting down if they do.< /review>

Very nice selection of vintage or recently retired military gear. Also have work gear such as boots, rain gear, reflective clothing and flashlights/knives. No surplus ammo, some gun accessories like vintage slings, M1 stocks, new slings, shell holders, mag pouches and more. My personal favorite is the German Flecktarn G3 .308/7.62 NATO Mag pouches. Very nice quality, ranges from brand new to used and only around 8 bucks. Also some really nice Chinese leather clip pouches (Mosin or SKS maybe?)< /text>

<review>Bought a 10x20 used fishing net, I liked the price so much I went back next day (today) and bought another one. I opened both bags, stretched out both nets, measured both with tape measure and they're not even close to 10x20. They're not even rectangles!! Lol! Return policy says all sales are final on used items but this isnt a matter of me changing my mind about a purchase. I'm giving them the benifit of the doubt that they wont give me any problems tomorrow when I return the the nets. I'm giving them 3 stars. I had to dock them at least 2 for the blunder and wasted time this is frustrating! Tomorrow however I'll gladly give them 5 stars and my future buisness if they do the right thing (my money back or the 120 sq ft of netting that's missing). Either way I'm gonna update the outcome tomorrow morning 9am as soon as they open! Wish them luck!!!.......UPDATE!!! These guys came through totally! No problem, I should waited until this whole ordeal was over to rate them.< /review>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) In this place you can find new and used military articles at a good price. Jackets, pants, hats, boots and even badges. They don't speak Spanish, but they are kind and understanding
