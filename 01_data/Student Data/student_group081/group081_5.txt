< Review>
I've been to this plaza less than 5x.  I did not know a taqueria is located here.  It was a Friday and I promised Tess I would get her poke for dinner.  I knew Gavin and I would get Mexican but I didn't know from where.  I wanted to get the poke out of the way first but serendipity presented itself when we parked.  Flamingo's was 3-4 doors down from poke.  SCORE!

Gavin ordered a regular chicken burrito and I ordered the chile verde and super nachos.  I can't speak for Gavin but he enjoyed both halves of his burritos, no complaints whatsoever.  I inhaled the chile verde that same evening; the pork was tender and paired perfectly w/ their fluffy rice!  I did not like the super nachos... the top of the nachos was good but once you've eaten everything at the top, the rest was rather dry and flavorless.

Skip the nachos.  Get the chile verde.

They have outdoor dining as well.</Review>

<Review>Best tacos EVER. My boyfriend and I come here pretty often and I honestly can't go anywhere else these days. Anytime we try, I end up comparing it to Flamingos and it's just nowhere near as tasty. Service is warm and friendly, they know we always want a giant horchata to go, and prices are perfect.
I couldn't ask for a better meal.
Fyi, it's tucked into the corner of a Asian market so it can be easy to miss.<//Review><Rating>5</Rating><userid>118045012212507594582</userid>< resp>

Very cute out of the way taqueria in shopping center with a variety of international food offerings. Into breakfast? Try the Flamingo omelette - it's amazing! Friendly staff. Decor is a bit run-down.</text>

<Text>I read the reviews before and decided to go check it out myself sends a lot of reviews talked about how delicious the food was well here is my experience.
Right when i walked in there was no greeting so I decided to take my own menus and look for my own table after my daughter and I sat down a gentleman came up again there was no greeting when my daughter and I got there the place was empty I kind of felt like just walking out but then I really wanted to try their food I got a fish burrito that was $13.99 and my daughter got tacos $2.85 each i read somewhere that this were street tacos nope the tortilla was hard and meat was dry the burrito was small and not really nothing different from regular burritos with the bad customer service and the not so good food i will not come back.< /Text>< pics>

< review>
I've been here for breakfast a few times. I've had the chilaquiles both with green sauce and red sauce. The chilaquiles themselves looked and tasted really good. The main problem was with the potatoes in the side. Each time the were completely doused in oil. I made the mistake of eating them and they were extremely heavy. If they could get that issue worked out I'd give them a higher rating but until then, 3 it is.<//review>

I come here to pick up for DoorDash a lot. I would say every 4 out of 5 times I have picked up, they take a very long time. I don’t know how the food is but, if you’re planning on ordering through DoorDash be warned- you will not get your food in a timely manner and it’s not because of delivery. It’s the store<//Text>

Used to love this place!

However, after my experience today I will never eat here again. I always order the same thing. The women (supposed  owner) who waited on us not only was very greedy with the chips like 10 chips for 2 grown adults, but got my order wrong. I asked twice for no tomato because I am deathly allergic,  she brings out my food covered in tomato. OK, no big deal. We remind her that I asked for no tomato she takes the plate, brings back the same plate with one of 3 tacos that didnt have tomato.

Then the bill comes and she charges me $5.75 for literally 5 slices of avocado.  When I asked about it all she said was that's the price for gaucomole . Mind you I didnt get gaucomole, I got literally 5 slices of avocado for $5.75. I think she charged me so much because she messed up my order and had to throw away 2 tacos. I have always paid $1 for the avocado.

She is always rude to me but I brushed that off because some people are just like that. Too bad for this place because we eat here alot. Like several times a week and also have delivered. My whole family does but after today I will never step foot in the place again and will tell everyone I know to do the same. Wish they would have never sold it to this women.

I dont normally write bad reviews unless I'm highly displeased but I was shocked when I seen my bill. Would give zero stars if I could!< /text>

This is a very beautiful place of worship. Beware if you have to deal with the office staff. The few times I have dealt with them, they have been unable to help me with anything. The scheduling is always tentative because they will cancel on you at the last minute.<//text>

<Review>It's absurd that this church is not open except during mass.  Myrna is not helpful, doesn't speak English and hung up on me during Easter week.  Myrna really understands the work of the lord (no). In an attempt to be helpful here are the HOURS:

English mass Sunday: 7:00am  930am
Wednesday  7:30am
Saturday    5pm
Misa eb Espanol Domingo  8am 1pm  6pm
Misa en  Espanol Lunes Viernes 7:30am

<Text>(Translated by Google) The person in charge of the security of the room is very despotic and rude in the way of treating people. I was in this place on January 20 all the most beautiful things I like the church except the person who works tonight supposedly in charge of keep people safe and instead prefer to attack them fatty hopefully this experience will not happen to anyone else

La persona encargada de la seguridad de el salón es muy déspota y grosera  en la manera de tratar alas personas estube en este lugar el día 20 de enero todo lo de más muy bonito la iglesia me gusta exepto la persona q trabajo está noche encargada supuestamente de mantener la seguridad de las personas y en vez de eso prefiere agredirlas grasias ojalá no le pase esta experiencia a nadie más</Text>< Pictures>

While admittedly not everything's covered here they hit a lot of major stuff such as PC parts, repair, and building, and their audio selection is of particular note. Staff's very friendly and easy to get acquainted with; the more you give them, the better they can help you get exactly what you need.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Customer service was excellent and knowledgeable. The team was able to give me exactly what I was looking for and best yet were able to send it out to me in Virginia. Highly recommend to anyone looking for pro equipment and solid prices. Will be returning for more.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

A very knowledgeable small business with a bunch of new and used cables, music mixing equipment, computers, etc. I encourage locals to use their store instead of Amazon or some other convenient online big box store type place. What they don't have in stock, they can order and sell at competitive prices.

Let's support our local small businesses! This shop is solid.< /Text>

This place is a hidden Gem for all of your tech needs. I came in looking for some computer monitors and I ended up leaving with 4 new monitors for a great deal. They also have a awesome selection of music equipment, gaming computers, studio recording stuff and bunch of other cool things. I'll definitely be back.<//Review>

<userid>104979543853791782943</userid><review>My dad pointed me in the direction of the Tech Exchange to look for a decent computer as a Christmas gift for my nephew. I started checking them out and realized that they do repairs in addition to selling refurbished devices. I have an old laptop that needed a new hard drive.

I gathered the old computer and my daughter's slow, heavy, huge 17' laptop to see what they could do. They gave me a great deal on two new SSDs and an OS. Really fair price. I dropped the computers off at about 4pm on Friday and they called on Monday. When I went to pick them up I noticed a Chromebook for sale that my niece would like. Instead of just selling it to me and shooing me out the door they took the time to plug it in and make sure it was good to go. They sent me on my way with my two computers, the old hard drives, and the Chromebook.

When I got home I powered everything up and they're working well. When my dad was telling me about them he said "They seem to be good people who do good, fair work." I definitely agree.<//review><date>1605375189615< /date>< rating>

<review>Great place to get a pc tune up and some upgrades. Prices are very reasonable and the people are super nice. Very busy little shop so it may take a couple days to get your machine back or it could be the next day. Either way it's worth it.  They also sell refurbished equipment .  Thanks S.T.E. you guys rock!<//review><Rate>5<//Rate>< user_name>

They are okay if you want to unload your tech stuff without having to go and deal with FB Marketplace/Craigslist etc. I will say, they aren't entirely honesty with you (at least from our experience, maybe they are with return clients) - we were told they could only sell our used laptop for about 200/250 so the price they gave us was a bit low (150) , but we have since seen it listed for 400 on their website.</text>

{'time': 1606804693336, 'text': 'Hi Kat, thank you for leaving feedback on your visit to the Sac Tech Exchange. My sincere apologies that you feel we were not being entirely honest with you and I can certainly see how a conclusion like that could be reached. 99% of all laptops purchased at the store have various upgrades performed before they reach the sales shelf including solid state hard drives, ram, accessories etc and of course the full service performed on each unit as it is prepped for resale. Each laptop we purchase is evaluated and then we decide which upgrades would be best suited for each machine to get the best performance for the new owner. The laptop we had purchased from you guys received both a solid state hard drive upgrade and a ram upgrade hence the increased asking price. Please also keep in mind that we are a buy, sell & trade store where haggling and negotiation is part of the day to day operation so a list price is a starting price which is always challenged. I will definitely have a chat with the staff to highlight the post purchase process a little more to hopefully help future sellers understand what happens behind the scenes and to not present a product resale plan on the fly but our goal is certainly to never have any customer feel that we are not being honest with them and again I sincerely apologize the transaction resulted that way.\n\nIf you are ever in future need of our services  please ask for me by name so I can personally assist with anything you may need :)\n\nThank you for your honest feedback\n\nSimon Antill - Owner'}</resp>

<Text>We have purchased many items at this store and the one they were in before and they are consistantly fair priced, friendly and informative. I would trust them with anything electronic. Lindsey is a magician always finding us just what we needed. I don't know how she does it. Also, their team is very knowledgeable about all our repairs we had questions about. I love that they are a place we can trust, with knowledgeable staff, reasonable prices and that I can support a small local business to boot. If you are looking for electronics I would start here. You are likely to go no further. They are that good. You will want to stop in frequently as they always get new things in too. So fun!< /Text><user_name>cheryl Ashley</user_name>< response>

I’m really happy with the job Sac Tech Exchange did on my laptop. They were very welcoming right from the get go, fixed my problem quickly and for a very great price too. The service and professionalism they provided was excellent so I’m very happy. I’ll definitely be stopping by again soon to see they’re different products they offer.<//Review>

{'time': 1582585895009, 'text': 'Hi Adam,\n\nI am sorry you feel our prices are high and yes you are correct if you are willing to take the risk you could purchase a computer online or from an individual without the overhead of a California brick and mortar store. We also include complimentary after sales support with all of our computers to personally ensure that our customers needs are not only met but exceeded on top of a 90 day hardware warranty and a 30 day exchange warranty which is essentially a test drive period so the customer can ensure they have made the correct decision :)\n\nAll service, repair and upgrade requests have the option of new or pre-owned parts but the unfortunate reality is not everyone can afford to repair or upgrade with new parts.\n\nAny 3rd party software installed is either educational, lite or a trial and functions as intended per the type of software but you would need to purchase a license to upgrade or advance which we clearly communicate with all customers. We do not charge any different prices for computers with or with out bundled software.\n\nI hope I have helped answer some of your questions / concerns and I always available to meet in store for a one on one.\n\nThank you\n\nSimon'}</response>

This place is a rip off. Outdated computers at a very high cost. You can find newer and better PC at a better price if you do a little research on what you are looking for and your needs. They say a PC is upgradable, but only upgradable with more outdated parts. And the apple computers they sell with Logic Pro X is pirated. That software is not transferable and can only be updated from the iCloud account that it was downloaded from.<//Review>

If you're looking for great deals on gently used electronics, this is the place. Super friendly staff, competitive pricing and found some niche items I was looking for just by asking, and was put on a list to get notice when specific things come in.

Went to the Sacramento Tech Exchange for the first time when I needed a laptop for one of my employees.   What an awesome selection of laptops, screens, and accessories.   Everyone there was so friendly and attentive, and they know their stuff inside an out.  This is my new go-to for everything tech related!< /review>

They opened up on a Saturday so my gf and I could come check out a new laptop for her son. I’m not the brightest crayon in the box but I know the difference between junk and tech. The same laptop we left with was posted at bestbuy for more than twice what we paid. Needless to say the kid is loving the new laptop and moms is happy she didn’t have to shell out 1k for a decent laptop. Anyone talking junk about this business is just that..... junk. I will be recommending this business to everyone I know. Thanks again guys your the best. Regards Joel< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I am so pleased 😄 with the work they did on my computer you just don’t know, I’m not a computer person, I brought my computer to them with a  ugly virus on it and they worked a  miracle. If you every need any work done on your computer these guys are the best hands down. Thank you so much ☺️<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Thanks Josh for doing a rush cleanup of my Gemini DJ mixer.  I appreciate that you worked quickly to accommodate my timeline yet you were thorough and got my gear back to me in time for an upcoming gig.  You gave some frank advice about an led light, which I appreciated.

I had also had Lindsey take my number down to inform me of any incoming powered speakers for sale and she just called!  You guys rock and I'm already thinking about another piece of gear to bring in.< /Review><gmapID>0x809ad0c3c4b917f9:0x58273980d1892d85<//gmapID><username>paulsanders1<//username><user>106344442733218103577< /user><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

<review>Awesome Awesome Awesome Store, and the owners are amazing, they helped me with my laptop only better instead of fixing the old and badly broken one for $125.00, she gave me a new same kind (Gateway) not broke and newer, price tag on it $175.00, gave it to me for the same price to fix the old broken one, all ready to go I love it it works so awesome, but the owners they care and are so knowlegable and just plain know who to treat customers, people in general, just good real honest good people, you can't find anymore, will take all my tech needs to them from now on...I recommend the tech exchange to everybody and anybody for all your tech needs!

<Review>Small family owned business with low overhead and a business model that benefits everybody.
While not the place to go for the most bleeding edge technology you can find real bargains here from people trading in or selling still usable tech. I got a fair appraisal and when things went wrong with my purchase they answered right away with a brand new charger rather than going the easy route and giving me a used replacement. Though their profit margin on our transaction was already small they did the honorable thing and accepted a coupon I found online.

Loving my "new" SurfacePro4. Keep up the good work.<//Review><gmapID>0x809ad0c3c4b917f9:0x58273980d1892d85</gmapID>< name>

I bought a used PC here in 2014. It was a refurbished and older model, but the folks here gave me an incredibly fair price on it. I expected it to run for 6 months to a year if I was lucky. However, it is still running without any issues, and it is four years later.< /text>

It can play any game in the world in epic quality (even the new games like call of duty infinite warfare). Although the pricing was unforgivable, it worth ever cent for its purpose. Great deal and the guy who speaks English in English accent is real cool. The manager has been great help. People in the store is honest for their work which is very rare to encounter in anywhere in the world. Long live the good capitalism and its people.</Review>< Pictures>

Decent shop.  The staff are pretty laid back, they take their time and they might not know much about every type of equipment, but the prices are fair and they don't try and swindle you.<//text>

I called and asked if they had a laptop charger cord and they were confident they did without even asking my model number. When I got to the store I got the last one, but they had already ordered more.  I was out of town and had left my cord at home and these guys were a lifesaver. $25 for a cord when walmart only had universal for nearly $70! If you could wait for one you order on the internet you might get it cheaper but when you need one now check here.<//Text>

<text>STE is definitely my go-to place for tech sales & service. I've been there several times since I discovered them last year. The guys are very personable. It's a little bit of a drive to West Sac, since I live up near the Sutter County line. But I've learned I can count on them.< /text>< Pictures>

SacTechExchange s a hidden gem for non-tech types.  Great prices for used tablets & other basics, plus a large stock of a lot of stuff I don't know what it's for...  it looks like it's DJ Nirvana in there!  The guys will answer questions, buff up your machine and fix it if it's giving you problems.  The fact that Simon drops a lot of F-bombs just adds to the charm of the joint!
Mixed feelings about a five star rating, but only because we don't want them to grow too much & too fast!
OK, OK... 5.5 Stars....< /Review>

BUYER BEWARE. CRAIGSLIST SCAM COMPANY. DO NOT DO BUSINESS HERE.  SHOP SOMEWHERE REPUTABLE!!! VERY UNPROFESSIONAL SERVICES RECIEVED SO FAR.

Will change and add long review at another time if issue is resolved. For now i am on the verge of suing this company and reporting them to the better business bureau. This company has destroyed my computer after it worked perfectly fine while attempting a trade for the last week. I have drove over 6 hours for multiple days after being told to show up at 230 pm. They then sent me away once more, telling  me to come back for a third time (another 3 hour drive back and forth) and wiped my hard drives after bringing me to the back and telling me the pc is ok. I am fearful they will destroy my computer more in spite after posting this review. Very shady company!!!! Seek buisness elsewhere!!!! LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES!!!!< /Review>

< Review>
The whole "we buy used computers" is a joke. Their buying budget is non existent and they run from high powered and gaming PC's as if they were radioactive. They basically want low powered junk for pennies on the dollar. Do yourself a favor and just sell 3rd party.<//Review>

<Text>I have needed to use a few laundry mats a time or two, and this is the first laundry mat that I have found to be extremely clean, they keep it neat & tidy, all of the machines work, the price is right and the staff is exceptionally friendly!  The bonus.....! They provide a drop off laundry service for a very responsible price per pound!!!  Kudos to Launderland of Placerville, CA.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Really great laundromat. Clean, plenty of space, I've had no issues with machines or ever seen one out of order. Change machine on site quarters only and the owner is really friendly :)< /Review>

Always a great experience, if the ever is one doing laundry. The place is always clean, never a machine down, great place, good people.
Even though they might look always busy, there's always plenty of room and machines to go around< /Review>

Launderland is a terrific laundromat. Very powerful, new, and well maintained machines. The staff is attentive and helpful, and prices are reasonable. Everything is clean, with plenty of folding tables. Highly recommended.</Review>

<Review>Nice little laundry spot.  Plenty of quality machines, quarter machine (that works), free wifi, stocked vending machines, and it's kept very clean. The woman working this evening was very sweet.

The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of five was because it was very difficult for me to find the street is really an alley in between some other businesses and I passed it twice before I finally found it.  And then the actual laundromat is hidden in the very back. I came at night when it was dark and I almost gave up and turned around before I finally saw it. Maybe you could use a bigger sign, Launderland. Everything else about this place is great.< /Review>< pics>

Not to mention any problems what so ever of mechanical/ machine issues, they are fast and efficient in resolving any issues you may have during your visit to their establishment. If ever in need of a laundry mat I recommend them whole heartedly. Thank you so much for the services you provide. If only more and more of our business' became as conciencess in providing the services you provide., Our country could be great again.<//review>< pics>

Nice laundromat. Good washers and plenty of dryers. They have several sizes of washers and dryers. Prices are average for nicer washers. Not a lot of good seating but there is seating. Mexican taco shop at the other end is yummy while waiting.</text>

Very clean facility, excellent equipment. Owner is rude to customers. Claims that you're putting him out of business if pop in just before closing to grab $20.00 in quarters (Acts like you're stealing from him even though it's an even trade.) Don't even like doing laundry at home as the machines are terrible. But since they close @ 10:00 it's my only option sometimes. He had my business and has now lost it, I will not be back. My Girlfriend & I spent a lot of money there doing laundry because we have a lot of kids between us.<//Review>

Mega washer $8.75
Dryer 25€ per Minutes
3 Basket (forgot what the name) $3.75
A small load $3.25.

Great, very clean laundry mat. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The machines are nice, and there are various load sizes depending on your needs. On a recent visit, I was having trouble with a stain, and the lady there offered suggestions and even let me use a product they use on stains, free of charge, and with her help we got the stain out! Every time I've been in there, someone is cleaning and taking care of the machines. They also have video cameras to monitor the safety of the facility.</review>

<text>We have been very disappointed in laundromat in Pollack Pines so we found this one on line. Beautiful large, clean working machines and a nice bathroom. We are camphosts at Union Valley Reservoir and have spread the word. Hope someone  turns in my brand new bra I knocked into a machine and forgot about it.< /text>< Resp>

It's a laundry mat never seen anyone who works there. The prices are ridiculous but the best bet is the double load. Did laundry last week cost me $18.00. The price shuld be half of that. Honestly a rip off but the only place near by for me to do it for the worger one is closed on the weekends, can you believe that.</text>

I like this place it is always staffed at least every time I am there it is. It makes things a lot easier when someone leaves their stuff in washer or dryer the staff can come over and get it out so your not messing with someone else's laundry.

My only recommendation for maganagment is getting more triple loaders<//Review>

(Translated by Google) For Mexican bears and food if it is good also in the butcher shop but the cashiers if they are having a good morning if they not only stay quiet and make that face not so much the truth.

(Original)
Para osas mexicanas y comida si es  bueno también en la carnicería  pero las cajeras  si están de buenas buenos días  si no  solo se quedan calladas y t hacen esa cara  no m justa tanto la verdad.< /Review>

Wow!

I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Their collard greens were a surprise because I have never had them before but they were so yummy. The candied yams are delicious and the catfish was delightful. I also had some gumbo for the first time, it was salty for my tasty but still really good. I would definitely recommend this place fir some quality Cajun food.</Text>

They grilled the bread to perfection so the sandwich never got soggy.  The shrimp was cooked to perfection.  The sandwich came with lettuce, tomato, sliced pickles and a sauce that complimented all the flavors in perfect harmony!  I'd recommend this sandwich to EVERYBODY!!  It's hands down, on of the best sandwiches ever!</Review>< rating>

<Review>First time here. First impression, clean and friendly service. Good menu variety. Got the fish dinner with mac and collard greens. All delicious. Got some big pieces of fish too. Talked myself into getting the peach cobbler and I would do it again.< /Review>< user_name>

I love these guys. I had catfish and grits for breakfast this morning. The breading isn't heavy, the fish is flaky. Got some gumbo to go and some Louisiana crunch cake. The real deal. Save the $700 plane ticket. Stay right here.<//Text>

<Review>We drove to Oxnard from Los Angeles  expressly to eat at the Cajun Country Cafe.  It was well worth the 2 hour drive.  Food is good, great choices,, portions are amazing, prices are unbelievable.   The staff is friendly, the owner Janet is the "hostess with the mostest"!  Space rather small but she is expanding into facility next door, outdoor dining is also available.< /Review>< GmapID>

< Review>
Got a shrimp po' boy and a side of hush puppies. I will  say the hush puppies were a little smaller than I thought they'd be but they were delicious! The real star of the show was that po' boy! Holy cow! The shrimp was fried perfectly, good flavor on the breading, roll was soft yet held up to the sauce and the sauce was very good. I'll definitely be coming back!<//Review>

Food was delicious! Had the shrimp po’boy, mac + cheese, and the peach cobbler. The shrimp was seasoned super well and crispy yet tender. Mac and cheese was baked to perfection and the peach cobbler was satisfying without being overly sweet. The ambiance in the cafe was also really special; there was a warm family friendly environment that I enjoyed and the restaurant was clean with the cutest decor. There was also smooth jazz playing on the tv - how cool is that!? Overall great experience, I highly recommend eating here. The pandemic has affected so many small businesses, I hope the community rallies around this restaurant and helps support its success.<//Text>

I'm a 10+ year round resident. I find this place to be very affordable and friendly. It's quiet in the summer and in the winter is very lively when all of my snowbird friends come. It's a great place to live.</review>

This is a cheap place to live. It's cheap in every way, the houses are cheap and the rent is cheap. Any promise they make when you move in won't be fulfilled.<//review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It was a good place to live, the income from the spaces was good, now it has risen 30%. I do not know if it is legal to make that increase year after year of 30%. That is an abuse for my personal enblo.
Oh trash all over the streets behind the houses I don't know if it's good or call the fire department since the manager of that trash has been told many times.
They put solar panels for the benefit according to the tenants but far from the benefit they now charge us for using those parking lots that should be public, the light never lowered the bill, so there is no benefit.
In short, the new administration that there is now is not the least bit helpful for me.
They tell me that I am the only one who complains, I say I will be the only one who has the courage to do it, or the most stupid person who gets angry just to do it because no matter how much one complains, in any way nothing will change.

(Original)
Era un buen lugar para vivir la renta de los espacios era buena ahora la an subido el 30% no se si sea legal hacer ese incremento año tras año del 30% eso es un abuso para mi enblo personal.
Ay basura por todas las calles por detras de las casas no se si sea bueno o llamar a los  bomberos ya que se le a dicho muchas veces a la manager de esa basura.
Pusieron paneles solares para beneficio segun de los inquilinos pero lejos del beneficio ahora nos cobran por usar esos parkings que deverian ser publicos la luz jamas nos bajo el bill asi que no hay beneficio alguno.
En fin la nueva administracion que ahora hay no es ni un poquito servicial para mi.
Me dicen que soy el unico que me quejo yo digo sere el unico que tiene el valor de haverlo o el mas pendejo que hago corajes solo por hacerlos porque no importa cuanto se queje uno de cualquier forma no cambiara nada.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

So I needed to get back into another rental since my previous one had already been closed out.  Albert took care of that ASAP and even brought my car to the dealer to have the battery replaced which was thankfully under warranty.  Go to Albert - he’ll take good care of you.</text>< Gmap_id>

She referred me to my technician, Adolfo, and he was awesome. Told me exactly what I need to know, had me come down and walk through the process. My first accident, but this place did not have me stressed out. Shout out to Adolfo.</Text><user_name>Aldo Rodriguez<//user_name><userid>113267629942555883578<//userid>< gmapID>

This place was amazing. They didn't have my parts, so they shipped it off to a sister store. My car was fixed and it came back so clean and they even vacuumed it. They even towed it back to me which was just a cherry on top. Honestly, so impressed. Thank you so much!</review>

I had to give them one star because that’s the lowest option , I believe one star is way too much for Covina location , they need more skilled employees and an aggressive manger who will make sure the car is fixed the proper way and nothing missing before returning the car to the customer  , I took my car back 2 days after I picked it up for multiple issues and when they returned my car back I found out one of the issues was not even touched , it’s either they forgot about it or they didn’t know what to do .< /Text>

Smooth drop off, smooth paperwork, and smooth & quick pick-up at Caliber, couldn't imagine it any better.   David H., kept me up to date, worked with me on email and phone to coordinate all the hassle that comes with repairing a car after an accident, he was great!  Also, the ladies at front, are friendly and welcoming, made me feel comfortable.  Overall my experience although not fun being out of a car isn't pleasant, I would do it all over again with the crew at Caliber, thank you!

This business is top notch. They help me thoroughly when I had the accident and that's a load off my worry list. They are very accommodating, transparent with their transactions and my vehicle repair progress. Even went above and beyond to assist recouping out of pocket costs with the tow company and providing vital information regarding insurance issues. Special thanks to Hector,  Branch Manager. - Marvin S.</Text>

They were extremely knowlegable and very professional. Their receptionists were inviting and well informed. We got our car back almost 2 weeks earlier than expected. Their updates about the cars progress was really cool and helped alleviate the stress. The work on the car was spotless!!!< /review>

My BMW  was  vandalized recently. The damage required extensive work. Albert my representative,  was consistent in communicating and provided the best  recommendations. Albert also took care of the insurance people (you know how they are) with no problems. I will definitely take my beamer back. Calliber Collision in Covina was quick and on time. I recommend you take your cars their. Ask for Albert!!<//text>

Hector and Oswaldo are true professionals and knew exactly what I wanted to put my beautiful car back to showroom quality... The girls in the office are very welcoming,  as well as make you feel like they are there to assist you. I have not seen another auto center make a owner feel that they can truly return if any issue arises .. First Class Operation<//text>< Rate>

They wasted my time and money. I dropped off my car for repair after being rear-ended only to be told that they refuse to work on it because they found repairs from a past accident. But instead of telling me as soon as possible they waited THREE days just to take of the damn bumper to tell me they weren't going to work on it and that they'll let me know when I can come pick up my car. They never called me, I had to call them on Tuesday and they said "oh it's been ready since Friday, my manager didn't call you?" Obviously he didn't. So not only did they not do anything, they wasted my time and they wasted 8 days worth of my insurances rental coverage! Don't waste your time with a company that doesn't care about customer service.< /Text>

I really cant imagine a better experience.   About 1 week in I asked for an eta on the car, I was actually surprised when Adolpho (my advisor) actually went step by step and gave me a solid date (5/24-5/25).   Usually you get the "well, its hard to tell, blah blah."   Now at first I dont expect an answer bec there is often issues once you start getting into it.  Then I was constantly being updated with texts... and I mean at least every 2 days, and often daily.  Sometimes these are simply "going as planned, all going well."   But you know... thats better than no communications at all!    But there was more often something solid.. "all parts are here" or "going into paint now."   In addition to the texts I got calls, usually once every 3-5 days.   I mean, how often do you get this kind of non-stop, constant feedback?   When it was done- ahead of schedule by 1 day- they picked me up via a free Uber.  Wow.  I was wondering who was going to give me a ride.  That took care of that...  When I got there, the car was pulled up directly in the front.  Adolpho walked me around, showing me that the car was detailed (not just a wash folks!) inside and out.  Unbelievably, I had a dent on the front left bumper (the accident was at the rear right so nowhere related) and they removed it at no charge, total surprise!   Adolpho showed me they had filled the gas tank... by this time I was just swooning with praise.   I promised him I would write a glowing review.  Here it is, you guys TOTALLY deserve it and knocked it out of the ballpark!

DONT EVER COME HERE !!!! I took my car in to get fixed after i was referred  by my 21 century insurance agent and it was the worst decision I made.I took my car in Jan.28 and didn't get it till March 21 and it was suppose to be ready according to them March9. I would get weekly updates by Luis. A week before my car is suppose to be ready Luis tells me everything is going good and they are even trying to get it done before March 9 which was a complete and utter lie because they were still waiting on a bench to install a part and no way they can get it done by March 9 and I was never informed until March 7 two days before my car was suppose to be ready that it might take extra week or so.
Which turned to two weeks. So I spoke to manager Hector which gave me an update and literally said "Well you aren't the only car we are working on" would be nice to know if they aren't capable of fixing car in time let the customer know
So if u want to drop off the car to be fixed and not know anything about what's going on and having to literally harass them for information this is the place for you. I even had to speak to regional manager Steve but that didn't go anywhere all he said he is going to talk to his staff and if all I needed was to vent to him cuz "what did I want him to do?" And then said well it's because usually people have a rental car and don't worry about how long it takes as long as it gets fixed. Well, I'm sorry when it's passed ur deadline March 9, I think it's customers right to know exactly what is going on with ur car that's causing a delay.</Review>

I almost never find any of the weird books I am looking for here. But it's near my bus stop so I am here all of the time. The clothes are plentiful and so is the furniture. Plus the staff are pleasantly laid back and it is as neat as one can expect of a thrift store in one of the dingier parts of downtown.</Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>They have a ton of items here. Everything from movies, to clothes, to toys, to retro items, to toys and more. The staff here is pretty nice. My only complaint is that it does close earlier than i would like, and the place doesn't give the vibe that this is a cleanly store. It's messy in the sense that there's a lot of stuff in a small area ok. It's a very organized store, it just has a lot of stuff to sell. If you're the type that likes browsing or buying old relics, or discontinued items, or likes clothes for cheap, this is your place.<//Text>< pics>

Approximately 10 years ago I started shopping in this store the service was great the energy was awesome 4 years later my world came crashing down and I lost my home The same people worked there that we're there when I bought lots of furniture jewellery etc One very cold winter about 6 years ago  it was about 36 she outside  had nothing at all to keep me warm I was so scared and sick with fever anyway I had been treated horrible by a cashier named Susana she works there now and the reasonthat I am telling the public this is because she used to treat me so good but now that I'm in a beautiful ihouse thanks to friends and the community for all there help she still treats me very abusive wshe calls the cops anytime  I come in she harnesses me  bullys me and is the opitimyof evil.  She reminds me of the blanket I stole all of the time. I have apologized I even sent $$$$ to corporate what can I do. This woman obviously hates me  so much do I stop shopping there and let her win.She even calls me names and trys the embarrass meI can't do a thing to make her forgive me but I'm not that person anymore.Besides when I was homeless and dyeing from the elements I always tried to be upbeat that woman glared at me time and time again.IS THIS A HORRIBLE REPROCUSSION OF MY MISTAKE. Susana leave me alone and stop being so ABUSIVE!!!!

They have started raising their prices on certain things. They are always sold out of most clothing that is on special half off the color of the week. I'm starting to have a difficult time feeling like I'm getting a good value.<//review>

<Text>Bunch of scam artists. Bought a bike for $40.00  only to find out that it was a lemon. Went to go back in for a return to get my money back and come to find out there was no way that i could unless it was a clothing item or electronic. Cashier was rude and had threatened to call the cops on me. I will no longer be shopping at that store to cover their wages.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I’d give it zero stars if that was an option. Went in to buy some chairs & only one chair had a price on it. I brought all 6 chairs up to the front to by then and the lady said that the price was marked wrong. I asked if I could get them for that price & the lady was very rude to me.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>The store manager  Susanna or that's what she said she was, is rude and lacks customer service skills it seems like she hates her job.  I have a tip if she reads it, it you don't want customers placing their items on a certain table for check out put up a sign.  Also when the customer is ready to pay do not make a huge deal about picking up the one item from the table that is right next to you and ringing it up.  This is customer service it's the first line of your job description if your the store manager you should know this.  Will not shop here again and help pay for your wages!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Do not let the placement of this place throw you off from quality. Set in a mall food court, this place tops Gaby's and other Mediterranean restaurants near by.

You can order a whole grilled mackerel.

Their salmon falls apart as you bite into it. My mouth was in shock as I am used to tough salmon from kebab houses.

Got the Greek salad, delicious if you like tang and zest as their dressing is has a. delightful light balsamic taste with added blended olives.

Prepare to wait about 15 minutes for your food. Each dish is prepared with each order. The meat is grilled fresh where you can see it.

Take home spices and hot sauces available.<//Review>

This food was ok, but I expect more flavor. There was nothing to put on the meat so it made the meal a little dry. Some hummus would have made this meal better. I only saw the hummus after i ordered. Also the hot sauce was franks, i would have rather some kind of authentic hot sauce. Over it was ok.< /review>

Two things I love... tangy and spicy. One other that I’ve recently added: healthy. Ive been doing my best to avoid the typical junk that I put in my body so I tried something a little different. This place is pretty good. The menu pictures will make your mouth water. A lot to choose from. The salad bar looked so so but the tomato and cucumber salad was delicious! One bite and I was in love. I would’ve bought a whole container of it! Very light and refreshing taste. The chicken kabob that I ordered was tasty. Nothing to die for. The taste of charbroiled chicken with a bit of lemony flavor. The rice also had a bit of a tangy zest to it. The roasted tomato that it was paired with in addition to the pita slices was a good offset and/or balance. Overall I recommend trying it. Only minus one star because while I was waiting, one of the servers had a disagreement with a customer and started back and forth. The customer said she preferred salad instead of rice and the server insisted that she should have asked before hand. The customer said she shops here all the time and always does ask before hand but that it must not have been communicated. Even though the customer was a bit snappy in my opinion, being a customer service rep myself, I would never go back and forth with a customer. Wrong or not, you ave to hold your composure and diffuse the situation in the most cordial manner possible, particularly when other customers are watching. The server definitely popped an attitude and gave some smart remarks when she could have smiled, said “I’ll take care of you”, and asked that the customer could just make sure the order taker heard her clearly so that they could make sure to have her order perfect next time and “thank you”.<//review>

I have been to the many Mediterranean far and near me, Massis is one of the tops. Two extra long sewer of beef Kaboudeh is less than $9 & it comes with delicious basmati rice, cucumber tomato salad + large broiled tomato & pita bread & boneless chicken kabob for less than $10 and it's delicious!< /text>

< Review>
I came in on Friday and decided to go with the chicken salad with a side of hummus.  I would say that for what I got, the cost is moderately priced.  Not overly expensive but not economical either.
The lettuce was pretty bland, definitely not enough dressing to really flavor the dish. The chicken was good though.  Hummus was ok.  The pita was pretty stiff. If anything I would suggest heating up the pita or making it fresh for the guests and adding additional items to the salad to make it interesting. There were some tomatoes, olives etc but the salad seem to be just thrown together with out any sort of real interest.
Service was unfriendly and the order took a long time.
On a plus side they give you a order device that vibrates when your order is ready.  It took about 20 minutes for a chicken salad with one person in front of me and they didnt seem too busy but thats an outsider prospective.< /Review>

Excellent food here had the chicken kabob and I got to say it was good.

White rice, and chicken and large coke, very crowded here in the mall. Tables little hard to find but they are there. Place is pretty clean.< /text>

The fish I ordered was tasty. But it was such a small piece, and all broken up. (I will try to attach a picture.) I noticed 'others' plates had a nice piece of fish laying on a bed of fries or rice. I ordered number 17D and expected the beets to come with the dish, well I told the young lady I wanted the beets, she said, "what I gave you taste best". I looked at her on the cell and walked away. I don't think I will spend my money there again. For the record, I'm black and they were all Mexicans.( If you see my first statement, they did not list my full review.)</Review>

The food is of excellent quality, and the taste is the greatest. Every dish I've tried was the best. Try it, you'll enjoy it, and I can guarantee that you will return.  ENJOY !!!

Please don't eat at this restaurant,  they charge for a good food,  and they serve old and smelly food,  rice was so stinky and smelly that we couldn't finish it,  not too many customers but they serve cold food instead of freshly cooked kabobs.  Eat somewhere else</Text>

There has been good and bad days. This time is the last time i will be going. I ordered to go and when I got there food wasn't ready! A lady was ordering food when I got there and she got her food before I did!! I had to wait like 20min for my food! when i got home the Tortilla was raw 😠. Very disappointed.Gave 2 stars because the food is usually good.</Text>

Drove 35mins to visit this place because on here AND the sign outside their door said they close at 10pm., we got there at 9:06 and the doors were already locked. So don't know about that 🤷🏻‍♀️</text>

<Review>Well I must say I really like my tacos at Taqueria Guerrero. I like their salsa bar, and especially the spicy carrots. And they are spicy. The choice is on the menu or extensive, and I may as well have made a trip to Mexico to find such a great variety of wonderful food. I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu. We have been very pleased with this takorea</Review>< time>

< review>
I eat here once in a while. Today I had two shrimp tacos and (my Favorite) two al pastor tacos. As always, chips are gratis, and the salsa bar is outstanding. I always order the tacos here, because they are the most-authentic street tacos I have found in this area. They have it all, including cabeza, lengua, and buche; not to mention the usual asada, al pastor, pollo, and carnitas. Although I almost always order the tacos, they also make a killer burrito. If you love Mexican food, you have to try Taqueria Guerrero.</review>

<Review>The food is fire, a real good go to in sm. I love Mexican food and this place has some the best tacos& burritos. Awesome salsa bar,  music in the background is nice, but the tv is loud and mixes the sound up a bit. Either way give it a try and u will walk out happy.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

(Shepard Style)  The waiters there are not always the best but the food makes up for it that’s why I do a 5 star. They’re sauces are OG prime.</review>< Pictures>

< review>
Been coming to guerreros for years as a visitor to Santa Maria, always enjoying the variety of food and drinks here. My most recent visit had me order the Al pastor tacos and my guest some lengua tacos. I Must warn that the salsa bar that day had mostly hot habanero spliced into every salsa we sampled including the guacamole. Was disappointed with that, as me & my guest ate less than usual here. The older we get, the less tolerant we've become to spicier food I suppose 😩<//review>

I had a "any kind of meat" huaraches ($13 on the menu) but I was charged $18!) I gave it 4 stars because love the taste of the meat: 1/2 asada (tastes smoky) & 1/2  lengua (flavorful & soft). Too bad the agua frescas aren't real aka homemade from scratch, but from premade syrup<//text>

This was my first time renting a storage so I had little information. Once arriving at the location I was greeted by Noemi and Kathy. I began to tell Noemi that I was looking for a place to store my stuff. She went into detail about the different units they had and asked about the items I would be storing so that she can assess which option would be best for me . Noemi made the whole experience as simple as possible while always looking out for what was best for me . She offered me a great deal which I had no idea they had ! She definitely saved me money while getting me a really good size storage. She went above and beyond by personally showing me how to put in my code to enter the building and also for the elevator. I highly recommend this place and Noemi, she was very friendly and informative.<//text>

<review>Exactly what you want from a storage unit. Easy access, carts are always available and the staff is friendly and helpful. With the help of Naomi and Kathy made the cancellation process extremely easy and that is why I will be using this location again when storage needs arise.< /review><rate>5</rate>< UserId.>

Had to move units a couple weeks ago and while it could have been a purely stressful day, Anthony's personality and care made the whole experience lighter.  I don't usually do reviews but had to give him a shout out for handling the issues with tact and maintaining a great vibe through out the experience.  Remember I was moving $#!+, I should have been in a horrific mood! Lol. Big shouts to Anthony< /text>

<text>This location has outstanding customer service, with Noemi and Kathy going above and beyond for their customers. They're always so welcoming and attentive when I ask for help or information regarding my rental space, they both should be placed under the definition of Patient because they have so much of it and I always leave knowing my space is safe on their watch. Thank you Noemi and Kathy for your hard work and positive attitude, you are truly appriciated.<//text>< Time>

Very professional the whole time. I did notice there were only two carts though and people were checking them out. In such a big building it crossed my mind they may be hard to get if I needed one  seems like there would be at least one for every other floor.

<Review>I highly recommend this location for your storage needs, besides the key location, you will find very dedicated staff to offer you the best of what you need. I was fortunate to meet Noemi whom with professionalism and kindness showed me options and help select a 10x7 unit, we’ll taken care by the way. Moving is not fun, It’s so comforting to find people to help you along the way, thanks again Noemi.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Noemi was my service provider. She was very nice and knowledgeable. So was another provider Jawan. I love the location and cleanliness of this storage facility. The storage unit that I rented was to my liking, it was kept nice and clean. They have all the necessary equipment you can purchase to pack up your belongings and store them safely. They also provide complimentary dollys if you need to store anything heavy and bulky into your storage unit. I liked their restroom, as it too was kept nice and clean. They also practice good COVID 19 measures at this place. I can honestly say that I had a great experience at this place and I would definitely recommend this public storage location, if anyone need a place to store their stuff. 👍🏻<//review>< gmapID>

"Kathy M. was my service provider on my first visit. Kathy is very nice, patient and an informed person. Kathy's coworkers, Noemi M. and Jawan G. were as well. Additionally, this place is conveniently located and Covid 19 measures are in place and being practiced. So far, I really like this location!"</Review>

It was my first time using Public Storage and Isaac made the process simple, easy and efficient. Compared to other storage places, Isaac delivered top-notch customer service. I’d recommend Public Storage’s service to anyone in the Los Angeles area for safe, fast and awesome service any time of the year. Much appreciation for Isaac & the Public Storage team for being the best go-to storage facility! Cheers to solid service</text>

I was in the process of down-sizing and Dominick took the time to show me my options. He assisted me in getting getting my items from the old space to the new smaller space.  It was super quick and easy and made my day. Also, having used this location for 8 years, I have to say every person in the office has been helpful.  Thanks guys!< /review>

<text>This location is great. David and Naomi are super friendly and very helpful. They conduct daily patrols of the facility and the whole location is super clean. They have dolly's and carts you can borrow to help make the move in/out easy. You can use the ramp gate to make the unloading easier but you have to ask the desk to open it for you. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend this location< /text><Name>Jonathan Martinez<//Name><rating>5<//rating>< user>

Currently renting a storage room. It’s always clean and the staff is lovely. Naomi is extremely friendly and resourceful. She allow me to take some of my stuff before  the 10 minute lockout since being a new customer I wasn’t aware. I recommend 10/10 for any storage needs. I want to say thank you Naomi for always being helpful.<//text>

Noemi was so kind and professional, it's a pleasure to interact with her whenever I go.

<text>I went in this past Sunday to rent out a storage and Jasmine was super helpful. She was friendly, informative, and guided me step by step on renting the storage. I wasn't 100% sure which size I wanted to rent out so I was taking my time and she didn't rush me at all. She told me to take all the time I needed to think and choose. If you're ever in the area looking to rent out in a public storage, go to this location and look for Jasmine!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Great experience! Everyone here was very helpful and nice, and they were effective with getting me in and out as quick as possible. I had a specific situation and they explained the contract to me thoroughly so I understood how things worked for me. Noemi and Stefany are amazing!</text>

Maria and Noemi were more than helpful when I came in at closing time on a Friday and had to switch over my unit.  They both had a great attitude and went out of their way to make sure everything was done properly and that I got the unit I needed. Thank you ladies!</review>

<review>Units are well kept. Staff is always friendly and attentive. When I first moved in, I had an issue with the door of my storage unit. Within a couple of days, they replaced the door and it included an upgraded hinge for the lock, which added security for the unit.  Should I need a storage facility in the future, I would use them again.< /review>< pics>

Just moved out of this space today after being there for 6 years. The facility was always clean and well lit and the staff has always been professional. Raelyce who works the front desk is an absolute sweetheart...very kind, helpful and patient. Thanks for great customer service all these years. I definitely recommend this location if you need a storage unit.</Review>

I've been using this storage for about a year now and Noemi is by far the best manager to work with I've had the pleasure to interact with and Jawan has also been great since he came in a little while ago. Always helpful as is the guy he usually works with whose name escapes me right now.

I highly reccomed this site if you are in need of space as the staff really goes the extra mile.

Thanks for all the help guys.
, Noemi
Plus I like their names, Noemi reminds me that Steve Tisch at Escape Artists movie productions has No Emmy Award, something Lorne Michael's, Ellen Degeneres,  Adam McKay and Will Ferrell as well as Joel Silver like to remind him of on a regular basis and Jawan reminds me of the movie Jawanna Man, a movie my ex worked  on.</review>

<Review>i didn't end up renting at this facility because it turned out to be too far a trip every day, but I was tempted because the staff are so knowlegable and nice.  Noemi really bent over backwards to find me what I wanted and like I said if it wasn't too far away I would have rented it for YEARS!!!<//Review>< pics>

This Public Storage location is very clean compared to others I’ve seen.
The Staff is always smiling and friendly. They’re professional and have excellent customer service. Raelyce was a pleasure and very helpful. She addressed all of my question and concerns with detailed explanations. I stored my belongings feeling very secure and well informed.  I’m a very happy Public Storage customer.< /text>

<text>Raelyce was the sweetest and most helpful to my family, I was in a hurry at first and she let me come back when it was easier for me, she also took us up to the seventh floor (her favorite) to show us better storage units.

<Review>I went in there and the girl who attended me was so helpful and she explained everything so well. I think her name was Estrella, the service was really great. She made things easier than the last time I was here and this rude lady attended me but I'm glad I had her today. Definitely recommend this place and try to get her to assist you, shell make it easier and quicker. The place looked very clean as well.

<review>This lady told me "I told you we are closing the gates at 5:45". She was about to lock us in the storage and she was aggressive and mean.
No respect to people..if you r reading this people, wait until everyone leave the storage..worst experience with that lady. Get people that are nice and fire her!!</review>< time>

Thank you for good service Scott and noemi but, you are missing in the office when I need to go at the most important times. I’m sad you don’t keep your word saying you’ll be back by a certain time. I end up waiting more than 30+ minutes of your supposed “arrival time.”< /Text>

They were great about helping us find the right plan to save some money and made returns of materials (we didn't use all the boxes we'd bought) easy.  It's been great every time I go to the storage unit.< /Review>< pictures>

I have enjoyed my visit at this public storage. An employee named STAR has taken out time to thoroughly explain the process of starting with Public Storage. I thought it was going to be confusing. However, with her positive attitude and patience all my questions were answered with ease. Thank you so much. This employee has set the standard on how customer service should be like!<//Text>

< review>
This location doesn’t even deserve one star. I was lied to and swindled consistently by the staff. The charged me an extra month when all I needed was one more day to get my stuff out. Arturo told me it would be fine to come in the next day (the 1st), to finish getting my last few items because they wanted to close for the day. I went back the next day and he himself told me that’s not the case and that I had to pay for another month, no exceptions. After all was said and done, I got a call from their corporate office who was still trying to bill me for a space I had vacated weeks ago (yet another blunder).  I then alerted their office of how inappropriate this was, especially considering how badly I was treated and why I moved in the first place. Thy wanted to know what happened, and I told them the last straw was that Arturo told me I had to pay for another month no matter what, after his promise otherwise. And the corporate employee told me that’s not true, and that they pro-rate people for late check outs all the time. Funny, when I called corporate to find this out, no one ever got back to me. No attempt to help me. They then had another manager try to get in touch which me about some sort of resolution...something I never asked for since I’d given up on their help long before that. But he only called me once, in the middle of the work day when I can’t possibly stop to handle this type of conversation. This company lies about the lies they tell. Please do yourself a favor and never let anyone you know rent at this location.<//review>

Raelyce gave me the best experience in my trying times. She made my transition and information such an easy experience that I am thoroughly impressed. Human beings like this are hard to find. Employee to customer experience is a very difficult thing and she handles it like the professional she is. Thank you very very much for the great experience.<//text>

<Text>Raelyce is an exemplary customer service representative she goes the extra mile to make sure that my account is updated and she informs me of any public storage information I need to know. I appreciate her kindness and consideration and all the wonderful qualities she possesses in customer service and as an exemplary individual. Considering that I’ve been with public storage since 2004, it’s an honor to have her here working at Public Storage. Kudos Public Storage!!!</Text>< pics>

Great facility, clean, great staff, just overall construct of public storage is a horrible rip off, if you pay for a unit they will not give you a refund to your payment source instead you wait (I am still waiting) on a reimbursement check. There is also not a pro-rated rate if you stay after the first, so you must hurry up and move all of your items and not pay. I over paid also by billing error after they did not send receipt. Still working on it to get reimbursed. The automated call system makes my skin burn the amount of work it takes to get to a live correspondent is unbelievable.</text>

The girls at the front desk are amazing. Cynthia and Vanessa are friendly, knowledgeable and always willing to help me when I have questions about my storage. I really recommend this location to everyone looking for storage because the girls will get you amazing deals and have a lot of sizes. Thanks girls, you've made my move less stressful.< /Review>

Raelyce and other staff are very helpful, but location is under staffed and office is constantly closed. There are two elevators but only one of them seems to work—on busy days expect long wait times going up AND down. Beware of the “helpers” that hustle outside, they can be hit or miss—if you smell alcohol or other things on them best to say no thanks... trust.< /Review>

Do yourself a favor, reserve a storage unit HERE!

Not only does it include amazing customer service by friendly, professional staff but it's also an affordable price for LA in a navigable location. Don't forget the convenience of managing your account online while having a flexible month to month contract :)

Obviously everyone knows that moving is stressful. My move was especially stressful, not because the fact I was moving from San Diego, but everything that you think could and couldn't go wrong...went wrong. From broken boxes from accident prone movers and sitting in traffic with empty gas tanks to wrong keys by missing landlords and ruined newly bought furniture and mishandled sentimental belongings- I begged the day to be over and naturally I dreaded my last stop:storage. It was heaven- the exact opposite of how my day was going.
Seriously I'm considering to believe in angels because when I went there, I easily spotted and found parking right away. I was greeted sincerely and helped right away! They worked with the movers and everything was stored and moved unbelievably smoothly! Words cannot express my gratitude and satisfaction. Thank you so much Stanley and Yesenia, I highly recommend you to go to this Public Storage unit!!< /review>

<review>Athea is amazing. She helped me fit a whole studio move set of boxes plus 25 more items into my tiny convertible and I had no idea how I was gonna get it all home. I was prepared to call an uber to transport boxes but her engineering skills saved the day. Noemi was pretty awesome too. Super helpful dynamic duo. Best public storage experience eva!

Had an awesome experience! Made an appt & had to postpone. Arrived ontime at the new appt. Staff was ready. Got an immediate tour of the unit I requested. Straight down to paperwork. I was contracted and out the door in 20 minutes. Now that is awesome speed & service. I'm impressed.<//review>

Raelyce and Jared were so pleasant and helpful.  My account was set up with so much incorrect information (at another location), and I was extremely close to unknowingly losing all my items because PS had incorrect info and was unable to contact me. Raelyce and Jared helped me clear everything up and made a difficult situation feel much safer.  Their customer service and willingness to help was greatly appreciated.  Didn't expect to receive such amazing service. And so happy that they helped me quickly resolve my situation.  THANK YOU!!!<//text>

Athea is amazing. She helped me fit a whole studio move set of boxes plus 25 more items into my tiny convertible and I had no idea how I was gonna get it all home. I was prepared to call an uber to transport boxes but her engineering skills saved the day. Noemi was pretty awesome too. Super helpful dynamic duo. Best public storage experience eva! Thanks ladies for saving the day! <3 <3 <3</review>

<Text>Raelyce helped me at this location, she was super helpful and patient and explained everything in detail about the different units and privinf. When I came in there were a few people ahead of me and she acknowledged me and checked in every few minutes even though I could tell she was very busy and the only person at the desk. Awesome experience with her, hope you get her during your visit.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I would definitely recommend this Public Storage to others. Stanley has been incredibly helpful on multiple occasions. One time he helped me move in for 45 minutes after closing, and another time he helped me resolve a late fee my account got dinged with unwarned. The customer service here is through the roof, above and beyond the call of duty. Thanks!< /Text>< username>

Do yourself a favor, reserve a storage unit HERE!

Not only does it include amazing customer service by friendly, professional staff but it's also an affordable price for LA in a navigable location. Don't forget the convenience of managing your account online while having a flexible month to month contract :)

Obviously everyone knows that moving is stressful. My move was especially stressful, not because the fact I was moving from San Diego, but everything that you think could and couldn't go wrong...went wrong. From broken boxes from accident prone movers and sitting in traffic with empty gas tanks to wrong keys by missing landlords and ruined newly bought furniture and mishandled sentimental belongings- I begged the day to be over and naturally I dreaded my last stop:storage. It was heaven- the exact opposite of how my day was going.
Seriously I'm considering to believe in angels because when I went there, I easily spotted and found parking right away. I was greeted sincerely and helped right away! They worked with the movers and everything was stored and moved unbelievably smoothly! Words cannot express my gratitude and satisfaction. Thank you so much Stanley and Yesenia, I highly recommend you to go to this Public Storage unit!!</Text>

<review>Got to the storage unit early and the staff was welcoming. Kelsey, a manager i believe, came back from her lunch a bit early to help me out. In order to help her coworker, Raehice(?), go on her lunch. Very helpful, friendly, and accommodating both of them. I reserved a storage until too small for my stuff so Kelsey helped me find the right thing for my situation. Letting me know about the special deals i was available to gain, as well as patiently going through the electronic paperwork. While she explain everything clearly, she answered any complicated questions i had. In the end, the experience went very smoothly. We had a friendly conversation, which is refreshing because good casual customers service isn’t everywhere. I helped them practice their spanish a bit haha. Moving is always a hassle so it helped my mentality being helped so well on a rainy day. They opened the orange roll up doors so we wouldn’t need to move the moving truck. A dolly was available for use, as long as an ID is given. There’s also a restroom in case of any long moving days. Thanks again ladies!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Rate>5<//Rate>< Gmap_id>

I only needed the unit for a couple of days. I asked the guy working if I don't use the full month do I get some of money back and he said yes. A couple days later I get my stuff out and get ready to check out and I ask the girl when the money will go in my account and she says they don't give money back. I wasted $80 for NOTHING. I wouldn't of got a unit of I knew that I wouldn't get some money back and she closed the account before I can say I will just keep it for the month than. I am just so pissed they need to get their stuff straight.< /Review>

We move to this public storage last month. It's was really stressful process. I was really upset of all the question they would asked my wife. All I wanted was to move already. The young lady was really helpful and I know she was just doing her job. Aracely thank you very much for your great help. Stanley the property manager has been so helpful. What a great experience with him. His attitude toward his job is really impressed. Thank you for changing the light bulb inside the unit.<//Text>

< Review>
This turned out to be the worst experience of my Life.  I had a storage for over TEN years because my place is small and I don't have family here.  I fell behind during layoffs.... Public storage rightfully sold my items.  I did lose them.  What is heartbreaking is my Birth certificate, social security number, medical files, other medical info from a former Business were given to the buyer after Kamisha Quall Promised me she would not allow the buyer to take my personal items.  Nobody watched him take the things.  I received a call from Venice at the location stating, "The man came down and said he only took sixty percent of your stuff."  He had almost ALL and only left junk.  He took ALL my clothes, including private Fraternity wear that will cause problems for anyone wearing it in public and not being a member.  My Grandmother and Mom pictures, family Memories that I can't get back.  Julie Turner from the Corp office got the buyer on the phone to see if he would sell the items back to me, at whatever cost.  The interpreter who spoke to this non-English speaking person said, "He don't want to sell it back to you.  My HEART dropped, he knows what he took.  How can someone assist a potential criminal.  Cristina at another Public Storage place said she knew the man, he is a regular there, and she tried calling but had to stop helping for fear she would be reprimanded by Kamisha.  This is so sad.   Thanks Public Storage, I feel like I can't go on.</Review>

I called to inquire about a storage space for my mother and Dawn was very helpful and made an appointment for me to come see the space. I arrived 30 minutes before closing on a Saturday with my mom (who is a senior citizen) and Dawn and Brittany took so much time with us and were both patient and knowledgeable. Dawn knows Public Storage's policies like the back of her hand. She answered all of my mom's questions and explained EVERYTHING including the vague insurance requirements. We secured the space and they even let us linger after closing to put a few things in our unit that we'd brought along in the car. My mom said it was so nice to encounter such professional and courteous young people. Thank you Dawn and Brittany for your help and kindness.</text>

Vanessa provided excellent customer service from the beginning to the final end of the rental transaction. I appreciate the professionalism in the time of a stressful event such as selling your condominium. Kudos to you Vanessa.<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><Review>Moving is not fun and just getting started is tough enough.  It was really cool to walk into the Crenshaw location however and be greeted by two completely friendly and helpful people.  Stanley helped me with boxes...POLITELY reminded me of other things I would need to pack and also told me about the return policy.  He asked if I needed temp storage  (I do not) and essentially covered all bases.  He even insisted he help me out with my boxes to the car.  Juliann was also friendly and fun.  It was just a nice environment to walk into and you could feel the good energy.  Thanks Public Storage.....you made the first part of this so much easier and I know I'll be back.  Kind Regards,  Doug< /Review>< name>

Good storage facility; great staff at the front desk. The two women who signed me up, Desiree and Raysa, were so wonderfully helpful and informative; Desiree answered every question I had, and Raysa stayed late to make sure I was able to move all my belongings in.

However, the hours here are terrible. I often have trouble getting here. I sometimes feel as if I pay this place way too much money to just occasionally drive past my stuff and wave at it.<//Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>This company is a joke. They change staff and district managers like socks. The convience of the location clashes with the unconventional business hours. Most staffers are trained to be just as shady as the owners.  Save yourself the trouble and go with a mom & pop especially if this location is on your option list. My experience at this location was a very poor reflection of past experiences with company in other states. Everytime I was there someone was in line complaining-95% of the time there is only 1 staffer 2 service everyone. not sure how they have such high stars. Something is fishy.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2bba0c490b3cb:0xf3b9f88b5161f0b3< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

After having many bad experiences with storage, (those who have experienced marketing tactics coupled with bait & switch, or the additional cleaning fees, processing fees, statement fees, additional insurance etc, ya’all know what I’m talking about!)...I spent hours researching storage online, I decided on a unit that fit my needs and my budget...I was armed with information and a confirmation number and marched in with my demands. I was greeted with a warm welcome and the sweetest smile. RaeLyce was very professional and to my surprise she suggested I view the unit prior to taking my money.  The unit was ideal since i have a disability and needed ground floor access. My bad, it was too tiny once I looked at it. Raelyce spent ten minutes trying to find another unit on the ground floor to no avail.  Instead of offering a unit twice the size for my needs with a kazillion dollar monthly fee, she sought help from a seasoned co-worker Vanessa, Vanessa strolled over with a hospitable smile and said if you give us just a few moments we will do everything we can to make you happy. I noticed it was ten minutes to closing for them and wasn’t expecting these two young woman to do more them discus how to get out on time. I held my breath knowing I was going to get stuck with a house sized unit once they delivered their tag-team sales pitch... to my astonishment, 20 minutes later they rushed back smiling, beads of sweat running down their faces. These woman went above and beyond to help empty and clean a unit that was being vacated as we spoke. It was scheduled to be cleaned the next day.< /Text>

This place always has issues. Hope I had something nice to say about this business and it's location but every month we stop by to check our unit and make a payment and we never leave happy how we arrive. They need to have more than just one person there. One staff member isn't enough. We have called Public Storage directly numerous times to complain about this. Last we were there we we're locked out of their facility with about 10 yes 10others for a good hour, with no one on the premises. After I called and complained, a location manager drove up maybe 20minutes later, never said a word to anyone one of us who obliviously had been waiting to be let in. She just unlocked main doors and went into the lobby. Very unsatisfied with their service.</review>

I was told that but when the new month rolled around I was told that I would need to pay full fare. And if you have a problem don't ask for the District mgr( Brett Winslow) because you will receive no help and where do I start, unreasonable, absurd, and down right rude. I would stay away from this Public Storage and very much away from the district manger. There are no lights in each units so you will need to bring your own light.

<Rate>2< /Rate><Resp>None</Resp><Text>(Translated by Google) It has many units, in its 8-level building, with access to two elevators, which allow you to access only the level of your unit, take into account that sometimes the elevators will be saturated, The same happens with the use of the devils (wheelbarrows) of the place.
With parking, have even more patience, since due to its location and its lot it only has seven parking spaces for small vehicles. And hopefully a little truck. So do not dare to go with a big truck as you will have many difficulties.
In this place there have already been robberies in units from one to several units at the same time, of which its personnel do not realize the theft until the end of the day, which leaves many doubts with the personnel who were in moment, which were fired or transferred to other warehouses.
So do not have the highest security of your belongings, so refrain from leaving valuables in the place.

Cuenta con muchas unidades, en su edificio de 8 niveles, con acceso a dos elevadores, los cuales te permiten acceder únicamente al nivel de tu unidad, toma en cuenta que algunas ocasiones estarán saturados los elevadores, Lo mismo sucede con el uso a los diablitos(carretillas) del lugar.
Con el parqueo ten aún más paciencia, ya que debido a su ubicación y su lote tan solo cuenta con siete estacionamiento para vehículos pequeños. Y con suerte u  pequeño camión. Así que no te atrevas a ir con camión grande ya que tendrás muchas dificultades.
En este lugar ya se han dado robo en unidades desde una hasta de varias unidades en el mismo momento, del cual su personal no se dan cuenta del robo hasta el final del día, lo cual deja muchas dudas con el personal que se encontraba en es momento, los cuales fueron despedidos o transferidos a otras bodegas.
Así  que no cuentes con la mayor seguridad de tus pertenencias, por lo cual abstente de dejar objetos valiosos en el lugar.</Text>< time>
