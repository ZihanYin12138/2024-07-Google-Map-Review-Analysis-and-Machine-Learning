My family and I had a wonderful experience with Nice Guys Movers. I called in they gave me date, set up virtual quote and booked my job all in about 20 min... Incredible!
They communicate professional, showed up on time and worked hard throughout the whole day. Moved from our 4 bedroom house in Fountain Grove to our new home in Brush Creek. Long day, but these guys got the job done.
Definitely recommend, if you need professional to handle your move!< /text>

There were great prices, awsome crew super great move. We call them and got all the information we need so we decided to hire them. The guys showed up early in the morning as discussed and managed to handle everything from start to finish. We didn't had any damages or lost items so it was perfect. We really recommend them!<//review>

<text>Best movers ever!! These guys were professional, polite , nice and super quick!! We moved from a big house to a condo so most of our furniture was very large making them fit in a small space a real challenge. We rearranged our living room a thousand times and this guys helped me move this big heavy sofa around with no complains! They easily reassembled all my furniture upstairs after. Even tho they were lifting very heavy boxes and furniture they had a smile on their faces every single time you talk to them and i really appreciated that. They definitely made my move a lot less stressful. I do sincerely recommend Move Central for moves because they are really great!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808438efffffffff:0xde093988324c0bd1<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Nice Guys made our move a very smooth transition. From the start took a look on their cool website, called in and was able to do walk thru with Zoom and got a quote. All within an a hour! On our move day our crew leader Dillon  and Charles were super friendly, professional and everything came to our new house with no damage. My husband and I were very happy we went with these guys.<//Text>

Great movers with great prices. With 2 toddlers and 3 dogs things can be a little hectic in an ordinary day...on a moving day...they are simply chaotic. Thanks to these guys I was able to just look after my children  without worrying about the move. They are pro movers, know what to do, how to organize and how to be efficient. Everything was safely moved, nothing got lost or damaged. Just a very big thank you from my part for all the help!!!! Highly recommend them!<//text>

I am a single mother of two girls and felt completely safe having "Nice Guy Movers" perform what was a difficult move for my family. I recently lost my husband and needed to relocate to somewhere I can now actually afford. While still grieving, I had to arrange my move to Ashland, Oregon and I called Nice Guys and spoke with Dillon. He was professional, responsive and most importantly kind. The price was reasonable, we were on a deadline and I was able to meet it and close on my new home. "Nice Guys Movers" were very professional and kid friendly. I caught them laughing with my daughters while they moved their dollhouse into their new play room. Thank you Nice Guys and Dillon for being there when my family needed it the most. -Sheena< /Text>

Update....they finally showed up at 7 P.M. Too late.  Guess what? They charged our credit card for the job anyway and refuse to give us our money back. I guess they feel that they can leave you waiting for 5 hours and you ought to be happy that they show up at all. Their time is valuable, yours is not. Strange policy.

Used this company for my recent move and was very impressed! If 10 stars was an option I'd give Nice Guys Movers 10 stars. WOW!! I've moved at lest 20-30 times and I can't think of a more enjoyable experience. These guys worked with a smile and they were lightning fast without sacrificing attention to detail and caring for your things. I mean, WHAM! BAM! and stuff was out of our 10x20 packed storage unit and in the truck (we recently relocated from San Francisco, but left stuff in storage until we purchased our home). Our team consisted of Mike, Charles, and Juan they were so much fun. I seriously could have kept them at the house all day they were such a pleasure to be around. I cannot recommend these guys enough. They were fast and efficient while handling everything with care. The crew was friendly and responsive. The last movers we had were horrendous and I was so terrified of having a repeat of that awful experience, but this company totally changed my whole attitude of what a move can/should be. We cannot thank them enough and hope you stop looking any further and book this company! This is a excellent company!< /review>

Good experience. Timely, professional and fast.  Plus extra bonus points, as the weather was 102 degrees and smokey. Not ideal conditions, but they got it done.  Special thanks to Charles who was the lead on this job.  Highly recommend this company,< /Text>

Luckily I found Nice Guys Movers last minute. After being left high and dry by another company(they simply didn't show up and never called me back)
Juan and Charles saved the day!
I didn't think I would find anyone none the less find a amazing, friendly company. Literally like tetris for pros fitting all my stuff in that truck. I won't use any other moving company in Santa Rosa from now on!
Definitely recommend, thank you< /text>

I booked my move several weeks in advance. Had a good phone experience and was given a really good rate and quote. We were scheduled to start at 10 am on our move day. At 9:50 am, 10 MINUTES BEFORE START TIME, I received a call from this company, informing me that they had cancelled my move and were refunding my deposit. Just like that! They cited COVID 19 as their excuse. I was furious! My house was packed and ready to go! They didn't even offer an alternative date.  After many phone calls to other moving companies, we found Need A Hand Movers who were available in 2 days.  No COVID concerns from any of the other companies, who were booked out until late August, by the way.  Interesting side note, every other company let me know that Nice Guys Movers is not a company they would ever refer to.  Can't wait to read what Nice Guys has to say about this review. They seem to always have a come back that blames the client for the issues.< /review>

They came out gave us a estimate, showed up on time, were polite, hardworking, and knew what they were doing. Truly are professionals at a reasonable price. Dillon and Charles were my movers. Dillon provided me with an estimate, which may I ad was about 10% under. Dillon being a young hardworking professional, covered the difference with a discount from the company. So not only were none of my furniture and things damaged, but I also paid what the estimate was even though they worked extra hours.

Just finished a move in Marin with these guys and it's by far the best moving service I have ever experienced.
From the first contact with Michael, and later with Ray, everyone was extremely knowledgeable and attentive.

They know the Bay area well, and they even knew relevant details about the building I was moving from (where trucks should park, etc).

During moving day, Dumaurier and William showed up on time, and were ready to with a smile on their face. They worked hard to get us moved out and moved in within 6 hours.

They had all the right tools and got the job done with no hiccups.
Lastly, they got my giant, super heavy, pull out couch up a tiny curved stairs, somehow.

I would 100% use them again and would recommend them to anyone looking for professional and experienced movers in the Bay Area!< /Text>

Used this company a few months back for a move and it was an awful experience. They dropped my dresser on the ground minutes after starting the unload of my truck, folded my mattress in half to get it upstairs, forever damaging it. One guy was sweating profusely and holding my couch and mattress up against himself. Wear under armor or something to keep your sweat off peoples stuff. When I tried to filed a complaint, I would call and have the same guy answer giving me a different name every time. I emailed a complaint in and got no word back ever. Would highly not recommend this moving company.< /review>

<Review>Dillon and Charles were extremely nice and hard working. I had to move all of my fathers furniture out of his house once he passed away. They showed up on-time, and somehow managed to moved everything all in one day! I will be using them once my fathers estate sells, when I buy a new house of my own.<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Very nice young men. not great movers. Did not wrap furniture. Damaged furniture. Damaged wood floors. Tore three holes in my bed. Filing a claim is useless. example, my credenza = 200lbs. Retail value = $3500. They pay $0.60 per pound and the credenza is transferred to them.  So I get $120 and lose my credenza. Sweet deal. Also committed to 20ft truck in writing, but denied this when they showed up with a rental 15ft truck. Had to take a last load that was unplanned that could have easily fit had they showed up with a 20ft truck. bummer experience. Would not recommend.<//Review>

Nice Guys Movers was a fantastic moving company. They were very professional and friendly. They were also relaxed which was well needed. They were able to also get our large bookshelf down the narrow corridor in our new apartment which was great. We were worried for that bookshelf as it was very large. They were really helpful. They quoted very reasonably and the customer service was very helpful. I have never seen a more helpful bunch of guys. We would definitely use them again and would recommend them.</review>

I called a few weeks ahead of my moving date and was able to schedule the move without any issues.  They immediately sent a confirmation email.  I also got a discount by scheduling my move on a weekday.

On moving day Nice Guys Movers called in the morning and let me know they'd be arriving around 9:30am.  They showed up on time and immediately got to work.  The foreman took charge of disassembling the furniture and wrapping all of my art supplies and furniture, while the other two guys hauled everything into the truck.  They even brought wardrobe boxes for our closets, and packed up a couple boxes of loose items that I hadn't managed to pack.  It took them about 4 hours to load up my 2 bedroom + storage unit worth of art & soul restoration supplies. We were on our way to the new place art studio.

Unloading at the art barn was much quicker, taking them about 2 hours including reassembling all the furniture.  No items were missing or broken.

Moving sucks, it's the absolute worst, but Nice Guys Movers made it as tolerable and stress free as possible.  I will definitely use them next time I move.<//review>

<review>Nice Guys Movers truly made me want to move again! They moved me last month so calmly and so easily! They did everything! I did not need to guide them or tell them what to do! They were amazing!! The moving team was super-efficient and super skilled. They took out the furniture without bumping it, they packed and moved the glassware very nicely and also they moved all the household items perfectly. It was the smoothest move of my life and they did not damage a single thing! I will call them again!< /review>< userid>

If you need a good moving company for your long distance move, you should hire Nice Guys.  They have value for your money.   If you hire them you will get a stress free almost pleasant day, if moving can be that.  My Husband and I hired them two weeks ago and they have truly impressed us. They were very punctual which shows how professional they are. They moved all our things with care and they did not break anything at all! The delivery was done on time and also they helped us a lot at the new place. Our move was very easy and simple thanks to them. We highly recommend them to all!< /Text>

BEST MOVERS EVER!!! I cannot speak highly enough of Nice Guys Movers. The BEST movers I have used in Marin County.
Their movers came ON TIME (which was an issue our last move with a different company). The guys were super friendly and fast.
They finished a move from a walk up to an elevator building in a little under 4 hours. They made my wife and family feel safe when I had to go to work.  The truck was clean too: which definitely helps to ease the mind.   Also, their pricing is more than fair!</Text>

<Text>I really hate moving, but thanks to Nice Guys Movers the process was as painless as it could be. They were extremely professional, great communication throughout the whole move, on time, fast but extremely careful with all of my items.  I asked them to move some furniture a few inches this way or that way, and a few heavy boxes from one room to another, and the guys were so nice about it. The estimate was on point and worth every penny.  I would highly recommend these movers to everyone.<//Text>< userid>

Aaron & Dillon were the best! They arrived exactly on time and were super friendly, responsible and hard-working. They were prepared with all the right equipment, and even helped us fix our bed frame. The whole experience from start to finish, including the ease of paying online and communicating with the team, was really easy and pleasant. I would definitely hire these guys again and recommend them to my friends.< /Text>

We moved recently and chose Nice Guys Movers after calling several other movers. We chose Nice Guys Movers because our interaction with Mike on the phone. It convinced us to try his services. GOOD CHOICE. Will and his crew showed up on time, wrapped everything, labeled what they put in boxes and moved us on schedule and at estimate. He and his two professional movers Benjamin, and Dillon were friendly, patient and hard working. The unpacking was equally smooth with reassemble things. I was Extremely Impressed. If my wife and I ever end up moving again Nice Guys will be our first phone call.
We appreciate your services.< /text>

I had an incredibly positive experience with Nice Guys. They kept me informed with respect to both pick up and delivery. My move estimate was fair and solid, and the movers themselves were professional and efficient. I have moved several times and this has been my best experience by far. I would highly recommend them.</text>

<text>They arrived on time and where polite and courteous. Everything got moved with no problems. Unloaded and put furniture, office equipment where we needed it. Great group to work with!
Everything got where it needed to be and no scratches, bumps or broken anything. Appreciate their professionalism. Also arrived promptly and surveyed the office before starting the process and did a walk thru prior to booking. Asked questions about items we were moving before starting the packing. They provided us with extra boxes as we needed for some other items needed to move to our new office.  Nice Guys are that and more!!< /text>< pics>

I was very pleased with the job this company did. There were four young guys, the leader of whom oversaw the whole process and was very professional "JACOB", polite, and friendly. The moment he walked in he put me at ease by telling me to leave everything up to them and not to worry about a thing.

They handled all of my items with great care and everything was delivered completely unscathed. They provided blankets to wrap the delicate larger items and took care to avoid leaving sticky residue when using tape on wooden furniture.

They are also extremely good value for the price. I would happily recommend them. (Remember to budget for a decent tip for each guy - because the first location was a 5th floor walk-up, we tipped $50 per person).<//Review>

<text>I would not recommend using this moving company. I booked my move date with them a month out. I was then called a few days later and told that they had over booked themselves and was asked to change my move date to the following day, which I did (requiring me to take a day off of work). I was then called 6 days before my move and told they had too many staff member request the Monday, which I was scheduled to move, off so they did not have enough staff to move and asked me if I could switch to Tuesday (that put me in another month - September 30th to October 1st which would violate my lease agreement). When I advised this was not an option for me they said they would get back to me and never did. I had to call at the end of the day and find out they just refunded my deposit. I work in the service industry as well and would never treat a customer, especially for something as important and date relevant as moving, in this manner. My experience was not so nice. I recommend a name change to unreliable guy movers.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rating>

<resp>{'time': 1582836715452, 'text': 'Hi Lindsay,\n\nWe informed the moving date you request would be considered a "floater", due to your move being a smaller than average move. Nice Guys Movers offered you a discounted rate, with a contingency. That contingency stated your move would have to start when Nice Guys Movers had availability that day, and that "availability" would only be accommodated if our movers were physically able to safely  move your household goods. Your move was set to be accommodated after another move on the same day. We did this as courtesy to you. Typically we do not "stack" moves, as it can become unsafe for our movers and your household goods to work long days.\n\nUnfortunately, our movers could not accommodate your move on the move date you requested. We informed you of this and cancelled your move. You became very upset with us, calling us a variety of vile names. We in no way are not upset with you for feeling this way. However, it is our company policy, "Nice Guys Movers reserves the right to refuse service to anyone that becomes verbally or physically abusive.". We do not apologize for not being able to assist you with moving your household goods as it would only be detrimental to both our movers and your household goods. However, we do understand moving and violating a lease can be extremely stressful.\n\nWe hope the best worked out for you. We are glade you received the deposit back, as we would not be able to fulfill the contingent contract we had with you. We wish you the best, and we hope the best for you.\n\nWe appreciate the opportunity to earn your business.\n\nNice Guys Movers'}</resp>< user_id>

Had to make the move from beautiful Marin to beautiful Bodega Bay. I submitted online for some quotes and some companies were really cheap in price, almost too cheap to be good so that made me nervous. Obviously didn't want to spend a fortune but also didn't want to have my things lost or destroyed or whatever other nightmare can come about. So when I was contacted by the good fellow at Nice Guys I was pretty happy with their quote. It was pretty easy dealing with them and getting an idea of how things were going down with my move. I appreciate having the communication there and it was very open and clean cut. No gimmicks. No bs. Just straight up and forward. Very direct. If I ever need to move again this is the only company I would work with, but hoping to be able to stay and enjoy Bodega a but longer.</text>

<review>These guys absolutely trashed our furniture. We only had 9 pieces. They spent most of the time on their phones. Every wooden pieces is scratched, chipped, and dented. They purposely wasted time so they could charge more hours.

Update: Your page is covered in fake reviews. This is the one truthful review. You sent 20 year old kids to our apartments. They set our beautiful wooden dining table on the concrete outside and spun it to create this damage. They spent the day on their phones trying to elongate the payment period. This business has conducted themselves in a disgusting manner.

We are Fountaingrove fire victims who used Nice Guys Movers because of their locality on round barn. They scammed us, took our money, and damaged the few pieces we acquired since the fire. Shame on them.

A search for their Yelp page shows they had a business on Marlow, that closed from so many negative reviews. SHAME ON YOU. Truly disgusting people.<//review>< pics>

<review>Nice guys, but not nice work. Being nice isn't going to reupholster my leather chair, or replace the broken collectibles (that were packed extremely well), or refinish the six dining room chairs that were scratched to hell. I could get 60 cents per pound for the damage, which would cover a trip to Home Depot to get the supplies to refinish the chairs. The hours spent redoing the work will come from my end. As for the rest of the damage, I guess I'm out of luck. The collectibles that broke were packed with great care in a uhaul book box. The box itself shows obvious signs of having been dropped. I saw them leave with half a roll of shrink wrap, which should've been used to wrap the chairs. I did pay for the roll, so it seems a bit shady. Additionally, one of the workers was on his cell phone A LOT. He had plans that night, obviously. Guess that's why there wasn't enough time to wrap the furniture. They asked to take a picture with me, which I hope they don't post on their site as I do not endorse this company.</review>< response>

I have to say that Nice Guys Movers did an awesome job packing and moving our furniture.  They are courteous and very professional, and very light at the same time.  You almost don't feel that they are there.  Their methods of packing the big items are amazing, I've never seen how perfectly the mattresses and beds were boxed and wrapped.

Coodos to the crew at Nice Guys Movers.  The way to go!!</review>

Do not go with this company!! Awful experience. All my new furniture, bed, tables, chairs, are all scratched. These are new and expensive furniture and now they are all bad. They show no respect or appreciation of the job they are getting paid for. The kids are on their cell phones all the time. Only one kid seems to work, but not really know how to pack his truck so he moved all the items around 10 times in truck!! Or that could be intentional to extend the time since they charge $150 per hour. The other kid just watched his co worker working or looking on his cell phone, at least half of his paid time. This company is a total scam. Something can be done in max 3 hours and they finished in 6 hours so they can double the charge! Do not hire this company!! One star is a generous score!< /text>

<text>If your looking for a professional moving company then look no further. They are nice guys, hard working and really care about my furniture and paintings. They wrapped all of my furniture with this blue shrink wrap stuff to keep the dressers from flying open when they were moving and they also let me keep all of my clothes in my heavy dressers(which meant less packing for me :)) I will be using them again for sure.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1523492335180, 'text': 'Eva,\nYour a nice Lady and the crew told me so.

Got off to a ruff start with about 10 friends flaking on me.  You really find out who your friends are when your moving, lol.  Benjamin was very helpful and accommodating the same day I called!  Dillon and Will came and we're great help.  I had a great experience with this company.  I would recommend them.

P.S.  nothing was damaged</Text>

<review>The worst moving experience. Broke our couch, dining bench, night stand and bbq. Left a mess in our house. Put our beds together very poorly, wobbly and crooked. Took 10 hours. I think the fact the guys were stoned the whole time had something to do with that! Impossible to communicate with after the fact. Sent a 1100 page document to read when I filed a claim. Gave no personalized communication and acted as though it was our fault and responsibility.< /review><username>Monique Corren<//username><Rate>1</Rate><Date>1560965878903<//Date>< gmapID>

<Text>A+ service. This is my first move by Nice Guys Movers, and they are absolutely Nice Guys! Haha. :) They are professional, and went the extra mile to make the move as stress-free as possible. They moved my mother from one adult community to another, and are excellent at handling additional requirements to move in these areas such as dealing with elevators, and working the move around other residents in the hallways. Very strong positive attitudes, and outstanding moving skills. Will in the office, was friendly, flexible and worked to accommodate our every request. Benjamin supervised  the onsite move - he and his crew were excellent, efficient and moved everything exactly as requested. I would highly recommend these guys to anyone. Job well done.<//Text>< Pictures>

<user_id>104285217893521295118</user_id><review>Just wanted to put this review in the right place, I accidentally put it on the wrong location. What can I say besides thanks a bunch guys. The only negative thing is Nick (one of the movers) did get a little impatient with my wife (who just lost her mother). I was not a happy move and my wife's mother just died. My wife kept going into the truck to look at old nostalgia and was warned several times by the movers this was not allowed, understandably. After being warned several times Nick informed us they would leave if it happen again. That being said the guys did a great job, especially Benjamin who did a great job trying to console my wife during the entire move. The job got done on time and very professionally. Not one thing was broken although this didn't stop my wife from crying pretty much the whole time. Thanks again guys you did a great job considering the circumstances.< /review>< pictures>

Nice Guys Movers are a awesome crew. This is my third time moving in past 2 years and I was pleased with there customer service, endurance, and competence. My move was a uphill battle and luckily they offered a Flat Rate. These guys arrived at 6:00 am and finished around 11:00 later that night. Hardest working crew of guys I've seen in a while (which is refreshing).
Hopefully not !!!! But if need to move to agian, I would re-hire definitely call them agian.<//Text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>Very shady business practices. Poor customer service by branch mgmt. The movers themselves were great, so I’m rating them two stars. In the end I regret using this company and have learned my lesson to check the BBB first (they have a D- rating and are not certified). My move was on 4/12/19. Both the supervisor in charge (Dillion) and my 2 movers openly admitted to me that there was a mixup with the truck size rental. My original estimate was for a 26’ truck and for 4.25 hours move time. However, on Sunday a 20’ truck showed up and my move time (and bill $$$) almost doubled to 7.75 hours. This is because my stuff obviously would not fit in the 20’ truck and an additional drop plus drive time was required, which I had to pay for. I am still confused why I was responsible for paying for the company’s mixup. I was not in a position to decline the truck they brought me or the additional drop time because I clearly needed movers and a truck and had to move out that day. These “nice guys” took advantage of that fact, which is really unfortunate. I’m lucky I had already moved 8 carloads before they arrived otherwise the bill would be even higher. I was under the impression that this company was transparent in its business practices, especially considering the quality and professionalism of the movers themselves. And I had hoped that when they asked for my feedback at the end of my move, they would have taken my concerns more seriously. When I complained the day of the move about the mixup, I was told “oh yeah I heard about that” and nothing else. Not even an apology. There was no effort to remedy the situation whatsoever. I have since requested that they compensate the added drop and drive time, however, they didn’t even have the decency to respond to my email. A company with good customer service would respond to the complaint as soon as they receive it. In this case, the branch manager should have phoned or emailed me the following business day after I gave negative feedback and certainly after I emailed a complaint. He did not, and I don’t anticipate he will. There are plenty of other movers that don’t take advantage of their customers. Don’t use this company.  UPDATE: in response to below response (which appears to be a cut and paste job): I was never given four options. That was never verbalized to me. I never called you “extremely upset” as you claim. You have never phoned me to remedy the situation. You have never left me a voicemail regarding this issue. You have never emailed me to remedy the situation. Are you confusing me with another valued client? This is the first I’ve heard from you since my move. What you are claiming is completely and utterly false. I’m still willing to resolve this but I’m a bit taken aback that you would outright lie to save face on social media.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1558129082154, 'text': 'Hi Julie,\n\nNice Guys Movers puts both our valued clients and potential valued client first. You were informed prior to your move date that there was an error within our scheduling department and we would need to bring rental trucks. We offered you the client 1 of 4 Options to choose from:\n\n1st Option: We could bring the (1) 20 FT Truck instead of the (1) 26FT truck and proceed with moving your household goods.\n\n2nd Option: We could reschedule your move date to the next day when the 26FT truck would be available.\n\n3rd Option: We could refund your money immediately and you could go with another moving company.\n\n4th Option: We could bring (2) 20FT trucks instead of the (1) 26FT Truck and proceed with moving your household goods.\n\nYou had selected to go with the 1st Option.  We attempted to explain to you the best option, if you, the client, wanted us to move forward with your move was to select the 4th Option, as it would cut down on multiple trips. However the final decision would be your choice.\n\nNice Guys Movers even due to the scheduling error still attempted to work with you to the best of our abilities. We understand moving is stressful and we take pride in trying to make all of our clients move as stress free as possible.\n\nYour move was an hourly rate move, prorated hourly. On your move day, you called extremely upset about how long the move was taking. Our Branch Manager did in-fact apologize once again about the situation entirely and once again offered to send out additional crews and an additional truck, at no additional charge. You once again declined. We attempted and are still attempting to remedy the situation with you, the client, after your move was complete. However, to no avail, You, the client, did not answer the phone, return our phone call and or our voicemail. You, the client, still have not responded to any of our email correspondence to remedy the situation.\n\nWe are willing to work with all of our valued clients, but they have to be willing to work with us as well. We do apologize your move did not go as planned, however we have made numerous attempts and efforts to solve, fix, and provide you with remedy with the situation in its entirety.\n\nWe appreciate your business, we know you had a choice.'}<//response><Gmap_id>0x808438efffffffff:0xde093988324c0bd1<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

NO STARS! THE WORST AND ILLEGAL. Had scheduled a move for 10/27 and were asked to pay before the move happened (illegal). Before we knew paying before the move was illegal, we were told to pay by 12pm on 10/26. I was stuck in a work meeting and called at 12:10pm. The man who answered said our move was cancelled, wouldn't reschedule me and then hung up on me in the middle of me talking. We then called Fresh Start Movers and they are the ones who informed me of this companies shady reputation and scams. DO NOT GIVE THE AWFUL COMPANY YOUR BUSINESS.</review>

<review>Poorest 'service' I ever experienced. Thankfully cancelled before we chanced our furniture and items with them. Firstly they chose to be late for their 'pre-inspection' appointment. Did not apologize. During same appointment, proceeded to ask what I considered offensive and irrelevant questions: "Help me understand the nature of this move. Is this a divorce or breakup? Why are you not buying your house now? Why are you changing your move destination?" Continued to change his mind on quoting. "Everywhere in Sonoma County $x." "Oh but in that part of Sonoma County, expect extra fees". After more poor communication experiences over the phone since, including more questions about "Why are you not moving to your house?" "Why did you change your destination address?" "Is this a marriage breakup?" we still proceeded to engage a booking date. AND THEY DECIDED TO CANCEL OUT!!! Do not engage these so-called "Nice Guys".<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1525900583875, 'text': 'Nice Guys Movers wishes you the best.

I am livid with this company.  Having been quoted $500, it ended up being $1,000 (2 beds, two dressers, two nightstands, one refrigerator, old computer desk, living room table and boxes)  They didn't even move the whole house!!  The movers took forever wrapping up the furniture (even when I said the old stuff did not need to be wrapped, I was told "It's policy.").  I then told them not to move certain furniture because it took them forever!   Also, make sure you don't have a lot of dust, they charge you $100 for "too much dust."  They said that's because they would have to clean the truck out.  That doesn't make sense to me because the furniture is wrapped!!!  What dust!!  They even held our furniture hostage and refused to unload until we gave them a check (they did this twice to us after we gave them a $500 deposit).  So they sat around on our dime for at least 40 minutes!  Please review their policies as they will nickel and dime you to death.  On top of that, we get a call from their payroll department indicating they had to have me do another check because the other one was written weird (my husband had to drive to the old house so I could give him a check, which I signed.  He was under duress from these movers and tired from moving, he apparently filled it out wrong) and then they threatened that if they did not get another check from us within 72 hours, they would turn us to collections.  They said they did not have the check because the "bank" shredded it (yeah, on a holiday to boot) and then said they shredded it.  When they turned us into collections, the collections said that they were told the check bounced!  They can't even get their stories correct.  Awful service, awful people, awful company  DO NOT USE!  Oh, they broke a part of our refrigerator inside and they said they only pay .60 per pound.  So if you got any china or expensive items worth a lot of money, you only get pennies back.

They damaged my table and my wood filing cabinet in the move. They left the water on to the washing machine valve which created a pretty big leak in my old place that went through the ceiling to the downstairs. They left a door off its hinges and when I tried to speak to someone to give feedback or talk to someone I was directed to email them and I never heard back from them. While the people who helped move were nice guys they were also unattentive. One was on his cell phone for a portion of the job. Definitely look elsewhere for good movers.<//text>

Our project was a pleasure from initial contact to the finished project and even extended to small details after the project was completed. It was a seamless process that flowed exceptionally well from estimate to completion. The crew was highly skilled and worked 6 days a week until the project was completed. They were the cleanest crew we've worked with and left our yard so tidy at the end of each day. We loved the design that Farrah created and it turned out even better than expected. System Pavers saved our project after we parted ways with our former contractor who left a bit of a mess, but System Pavers rose to the occasion and corrected our drainage system and then installed gorgeous, modern pavers around our pool and outdoor living areas and installed beautiful turf, too. Their attention to detail is truly impressive and a joy for us to see and use every day. We used the financing that System Pavers is affiliated with, which was very convenient. We would highly recommend System Pavers!</review>

As time went on, the ideas changed quite a bit. It required three separate visits from Heidi and a lot of last minute changes, but I finally came to a design I liked, paid for it, and it was done. I was a difficult customer but everyone at System Pavers was professional and patient with me as we went through the process. Luis was a great project manager. He kept me up to date, answered all my questions, and made sure every issue I brought up was addressed. The project came out perfect and I am 100% happy with the outcome. They are a bit pricey, but there is no point in trying to cut costs when you are doing a big project like this to your house or yard.<//text><user_name>Andrew Wayne Post<//user_name><time>1606767385296< /time>< rate>

<Review>Alex was my project manager. He came each day to check up on the project and kept me in the loop. Was very helpful assisting challenges that arose. Kept the job on track and it was completed in 2 and 1/2 weeks. Job site was cleaned up each day. He is a great communicator and takes pride in his work.
Between Andrew's design and Alex's direction I have the best backyard in the complex.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<text>In the matter of a few weeks we went from a backyard wasteland full of cracked concrete, broken irrigation lines, a patio that would never drain right to a masterpiece worth being proud of. System Pavers and our project manager Alex were AMAZING. In short order they were able to transform our backyard from a place we never wanted to be to a place that we always want to be. The pavers they installed are amazing, all of the drainage works perfectly, and it is now a safe place for us to enjoy as a family. If you are in the market for some backyard work, call System Pavers first. They are fast, organized, curious and professional. Make sure you ask for Alex and his crew too because they are incredible.</text><Gmap_id>0x80dc74c37b09fa31:0x1c9a7c7d6edbd484</Gmap_id></record>

<review>I had an awful experience with system pavers. The field shifted, the wall cap came loose. When System Pavers was contacted I was told No Guarantee on my job. This company is just interested in " The Sale". Improper prep. Not adequate base or properly prepped. Only saw 2 wirkers for 2 days. In and out fast looked good for 2 month's then the pavers moved. Then the bond on the cap came loose. Terrible Customer Service. Only wanted the sale..<//review>< pictures>

The salesman was awesome...the installation ran over by two days but looked good. Their accounting department was a nightmare and double charged me but we finally got it resolved. It took 8 days.

The biggest disappointment is the project management. Horrific communication- late and poor. Worst of all, the countless unkept promises.

Project was done, and we went through final. They promised to fix two chipped pavers. They have told us several times “we will be out”, “we have them” or “we will be there tomorrow”....ghost.

They are premium priced (over priced)...but I never mind paying for quality....here/ missed the mark.

My neighbor used someone else and saved $3,000.

I wish I used his person.

This last item wasn’t an “issue”, but they made it one.

I can not recommend</Text>

<review>System Pavers San Diego is a 5 Star Company.
We first met with Heidi Dukefoss at an open house at the System Pavers Carlsbad office.
She spent plenty of time talking with us as we explained our project and what we wanted to have done around our house.
During the design phase she put all our wishes into a wonderful design for our back yard, patio cover, artificial turf, side walkway, front porch which included a ramped walkway, front yard and driveway.
All during the design phases she made recommendations to our project.
2 weeks before the project was to start we had a walk through with Heidi and the Project Manager John Parkhurst.
The walk through covered all aspects to the project and how the work would be done.
The project started on Monday 30 January 2017.
John’s work crew lead by Rafael arrived on time as they did every day.
The work proceeded every day and even with a few rain delay days they finished the work on 16 February 2017.
As with any home projects there were a couple of hurdles to get over and Rafael’s crew handled them with great professionalism.
Rafael and his entire crew worked very hard and every member is a real craftsman.
He made a few suggestions as the work proceeded and each one was right on and made the final product even better,
We give System Pavers and every member of their staff a 5 Star Rating.
And our highest praises go to Heidi Dukefoss Design Consultant, John Parkhurst Project Manager, Rafael Crew Foreman and his entire crew.

<text>I have waited a few months to write this review to 1) give System Pavers a chance to correct the issue and 2) not write it out of anger.

Our landscape install was completed by SP on 1/31/2020. From the time we signed the contract to the day the project started was just over a month. The crew worked fast, they were respectful, and cleaned up their mess everyday.

If you live in Southern California you know we had a heavy rainy season this year. It was around April that the sun decided to make its appearance and the weather warmed up. My husband and I noticed a melted strip of turf on our side yard. We had no idea how it happened. We checked our security cameras to see if it was vandalism but nothing was on it. We tried pinpointing the issue the next few days and as more melted areas appeared we realized it was our E grade windows causing a reflection on the turf and melting it. We put in a work order and our project manager came out rather quickly. He said that it was from the reflection of our windows, he has seen it before, and it is NOT covered by our warranty. Excuse me? We just spent over 30k on our backyard and less than 3 months of completion our turf is melted. Mind you we upgraded our turf in the backyard because that is where our children play. Call us naive but we didn’t know turf melting was a thing. As “experts” in their line of work our designer should have educated us. If not here the project manager who has admittedly seen it happen before should have educated us. Desperate to stop the issue we reached out to some window filming companies. We found the most amazing guy at RC Windows Films. It just so happened that he is on the board of the Synthetic Turf Counsel. He agreed that it is complete BS that SP did not educate us, did not offer a different design, and did not give us the option of a turf with a higher melting point. He even reached out to SP on our behalf to try to get them to work with us. He offered to send them a few thermometers on his dime that would be able to tell SP is turf melting will be an issue during their installs. We spent $1000 on window films. RC Window Films sent SP the pictures of the completed job hoping that they would fix our turf now that the problem has been solved and we never heard from them.
We also never received our $500 referral check for our neighbors two houses down using System Pavers. They had the same designer as us and she texted me Feb 1st saying she just met with our neighbors and put us down as their referral. Their yard install has also given them trouble. They had rain water flooding the foundation of their home. SP did come out and fix it as it was their fault. Our immediate next door neighbors were all set and ready to go with System Pavers until SP increased the agreed upon price by an extra $1000 with no real explanation.

That is 3 houses on one street who have all had bad experiences with this company. We live in a new housing development and our neighbors are finding companies with much better pricing and their yards are gorgeous! We definitely feel like SP is not in it for the customer relationship and just in it for the paycheck. I will say that our project manager was a great guy. He offered to come back on his own time and patch the melted areas with our left over turf at no cost. When he came back to do the work it turns out that our left over turf was from our front yard and did not match the turf in the back so we still have damaged turf. At least he tried though. It’s more than I can say for the rest of the company.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Having my backyard's former lawn area paved with System Pavers was such an excellent experience and the results are stunning. From Andrew, who first met with me, to Ryan who managed the project, and to Crispin who completed the work, all were professional, polite, and friendly. The project took about five days and at the end of each workday, the tools and supplies were neatly stored and the areas swept. I highly recommend them! No hesitation!</Text>

Awesome team! My brand new house front yard and backyard looks amazing!! Emily did fabulous job working with both of us and kept up with the changes in plan. Her design met and exceeded our expectation especially my husband's rigid budget and his wish for low maintenance front and backyard. The only two things I wanted out of it are the flow from the inside to outside with design standpoint and the sitting area in front to be able to view amazing sunset. Dustin, Ruben and their crew were very professional and finished the work in timely manner. We expected two to three months project because almost all
of our neighbors finished their project in 3 months. Dustin and the guys finished in a month! Dustin kept in touch with my husband daily with updates and even accommodated the changes as well. Thank you Emily, Dustin, Ruben and the amazing crew for the beautiful work!</Text>

I was looking to enhance the curbside beauty as well as the functionality of my front yard and my back yard, and System Pavers outperformed any and all expectations and hopes I could have had.

From the design created by John (JJ) S., to the superb installation by Luis R. and his outstanding crew, my house was transformed from simply "another house in the neighborhood" to the "talk of the neighborhood".

System pavers lived up to their verbal commitments and their written contracts, and throughout the entire 3-week project, checked with me every few days to make certain that the job was being installed to my satisfaction.

I increased the job scope along the way, and System Pavers didn't skip a beat!  They modified their plans to accommodate my enhancement requests, and finished project is worthy of being advertised in a professional publication.

I whole-heartedly recommend System Pavers to anyone considering enhancing the beauty and functionality of their outdoor living areas!</text>

We want to make sure people know that System Pavers did a fantastic job for us. From beginning to end and throughout the process we never had a problem. Our designer Luke, our project manager Ryan, and all the builders who work onsite were very professional. They worked long hours, kept the work site clean, and even finished a little ahead of schedule. We get compliments from our neighbors and even complete strangers ask us for the name of the company who did the work.

Emily is AMAZING because she not only knows her design job but also everything about Sonos audio system that this company installs.  We have a beautiful driveway that people have stopped and complimented us on.  We also have surround sound in our back yard.  Which is totally needed for our monthly summer movie nights. We can also turn on the sound through our phone without the TV on and listen to music.

We were stumped as to how to best address our tired 90s front and backyard and were thinking about hiring a landscape architect when a friend recommended we contact System Pavers.  Emily Kaye-Eddie came to our house and spent 3 hours helping us create a vision for what we could have - basically, everything a landscape designer would do.  About 2 weeks later she presented us with a beautifully drawn design that incorporated a vision that was so much better than anything we had thought of.

<review>I recently had my driveway and entry walkway replaced by System Pavers. I couldn't be happier. The design consultant was friendly and offered suggestions which enhanced the appearance. It was suggested to widen my driveway and walkway. I really love the extra width. The project manager was professional and often told to me to call if I had any concerns. The work crew was always on time and worked continuously. The project was completed earlier than planned. The entire area was completely cleaned at the end of the project.I love the new driveway and walkway. Many neighbors stop by and comment on how beautiful it is.</review><user_name>Randy Shannahan< /user_name><Date>1476494046526</Date><rating>5<//rating>< GmapID>

<Text>Our neighbors hired System Pavers to redo their driveway. It is a very unprofessional company with disrespectful workers. No regard for surrounding homeowners. They cut pavers without a wet saw which made a big mess throughout the neighborhood. Would not recommend them for hire.</Text><userid>116793656208147895251< /userid><resp>None< /resp>< Date>

Showed me lots of photos and explained the installation process and the warranty. Fair price for all that is involved. Matt was our project manager whom made it come to life. The crew were fast and very efficient and cleaned up each day. Was totally done in 3 days. Amazing job. I definitely recommend them!</Review>< Pictures>

Hard work, honest, passionate, and truly wants the customer to be happy. She was honest about ideas and what would work and wouldn’t work and tried to keep things budget friendly. She was the reason we chose System Pavers. Project was a challenge overall - small front courtyard area with a lot of things done by previous owner which made no sense. They worked with us to make it to code and the outcome was fantastic. Had some small bumps which they fixed - a complex project 600 + sqft done in 5 days with a 25 year warranty- everything was dialed in start to finish and very HOA friendly.  We overall are very happy and now working on our second project with them driveway!  Thank you System Pavers and especially to Cathy for your passion and commitment !

<review>We contracted with Systems Pavers for a 5,00O square foot driveway and we had a professional experience.  The sales person, Emily Kaye-Eddie was very clear about what is involved in demo and prepping before they hand-lay the pavers. She made sure we were aware of various financing options.  (Six months same as cash, twelve month no interest, or credit card).

The day after our driveway was measured and the contract was signed I received a call with the start date and a project manager.  Our project manager, John Parkhurst came when he said he would, returned calls within an hour and made daily on site check-ins.  He assigned a five man crew including a foreman.  Rafa kept everyone on task and worked with me when we needed to make adjustments.

The project took eight days. On the ninth day Emily came by to see the finished project and check on our satisfaction. On the eleventh day John checked in to have me sign off on the project and to review care and maintenance. (Kitty litter on oil stains, round-up on weeds,).

Our large driveway looks lovely and is guaranteed for twenty-five years.   I sound like an ad because I can't  say enough good things about this experience.   In twenty years of home ownership and various home improvement projects this has been the most professional.<//review></record>

Best service available! If you want quality service for your money spent go with system pavers. Luke, Dustin were exceptionally great I planning my project. The construction crew was amazing and fun to talk to. Big difference between system pavers and other companies is that they take their time to help you fit your needs. Other companies didn't even bother to follow up with me. I greatly appreciate the planning phase and even advice when choosing colors and design. Thanks alot and look forward to another project in the future.<//Review>

<text>We had a very good experience with Systems Pavers. Our front yard was in dire need of some curb appeal and we were not sure how to go about it. We wanted pavers with some steps leading to the front door but we had no real plan. Heidi showed us several options and it all came together. We love our steps with LED lights and the pattern with borders and angles leading to the front door is great. The color choices for the pavers were a little overwhelming at first but with Heidi's help we figured it out. We get lots of compliments about the design.<//text>< pics>

<user>114026000514966480344</user><Date>1450414013615< /Date><Review>From our first contact with System Pavers they were thoroughly professional, knowledgeable, punctual and service-oriented.  After deciding to re-landscape our front yard in drought-friendly pavers and artificial turf, we called a number of companies for quotes on the job.  Larry, a designer from System Pavers was able to take our basic ideas, use his expertise to make excellent suggestions on design, brick styles and colors, etc. and give us a very competitive quote. Other companies we called either didn't show up, or told us what they couldn't do as opposed to what they could do. Within a day or two of signing the contract, System Pavers called to schedule the job.  Our job manager John stopped by and we went over the design and discussed the details.  On the agreed start date, Raphael showed up at 7:30 am with his crew and John showed him the design.  Raphael's crew did a fantastic job...  they showed up on time every day until the job was complete, worked hard every day and obviously were very experienced. They were respectful, clean (they even brought their own porta-potti), and made sure before starting each phase of the job they were doing what we wanted.  Amazingly, the job was finished in a just little over a week, and we couldn't be more pleased.  I recommend System Pavers highly and wouldn't hesitate to use them again.<//Review><Resp>{'time': 1451323790356, 'text': "Hi John,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave your review.

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>We had System Pavers replace our concrete driveway several years ago. We were happy with the design, quality, and workmanship and were impressed by the time it took them to demolish, install, and complete the 1600 sq feet project in 3 days.

We have been thinking about a backyard transformation and front yard artificial turf for some time. We contacted System Pavers based on our past experience. We met Emily, design consultant. She spent a considerable amount of time discussing what we could do in our backyard, listened to what we liked, and gave us great suggestions and ideas. In a few days, she came up with a design concept that looked beautiful and functional on paper. We met additional times at home and at the showroom to fine tune the design. We found her to be so enthusiastic, friendly and professional. We were excited to start the project.

We met with Emily, Matt (project manager), and Rafa (construction lead) on June 20, 2016. Work started on June 21st, 2016. Those were HOT weeks in June and July, but the crew worked hard 6 days a week on most weeks. We had some change orders and challenges during construction but Matt was there to supervise and to address and resolve issues as they came up. With some of the features like the BBQ island and the spillways, his expertise really made a difference in the finished look and functionality. Matt is professional and great to work with. The crew was skilled and the workmanship on the pavers was exceptional so we would like to special mention Rafa, Miguel, Saul and Julian who we saw regularly for 5 weeks. The crew was also courteous and cleaned up at the end of each day. We also like to thank John Hanes who enhanced the solid patio cover design with lights and ceiling fans and his crew who installed the beautiful pergola in 1 1/2 days. The fireplace and lighting turned out really great. The quality of the turf is superior. The turf transformed the front yard and complemented the backyard hardscape.  Near the end of the project, the crew put back together things that had to be disconnected (irrigation) or moved (shed, dirt). Throughout the duration of the project, Emily followed up with us.

Having the 25 year warranty is another reason why we chose System Pavers. There are a few details to be done but overall the new backyard is now an amazing outdoor living space which we will enjoy for years to come. Thank you System Pavers!

My enclosed patio was a mess with overgrown plants, leaking underground irrigation, a paver walkway to the doir that was not installed to the CA building code.  Don Briggs and Aaron Dishon of System Pavers tackled this project, solving all the problems, so my new patio is now a beautiful masterpiece!  I am very impressed because I was not sure that all the problems could be fixed but they were.  Aaron and Don were responsive to all my panic attacks, answering my phone calls immediately and appearing on-site to explain how the problem areas would be addressed.  Thank you System Pavers.<//text>

My first encounter with System Pavers was at their display at the Del Mar Fair. I contacted them and discussed the costs to renovate my back yard. Their prices were very steep and I could not afford to move forward with this project. It was not until recently that I crossed paths with System Pavers again. They installed a brick driveway next door to my home.

The process moved along pretty quickly and it looks great, however I would not recommend based on my experience.  They set up their cement cutting saw adjacent to my property line and there was cement dust billowing up and everywhere. This left my vegetable garden and decks covered in soot which is so uncool. I spent hours sweeping, vacuuming and finally resorted to washing the decks to remove the layer of construction debris. They should have put up a silt fence or worked on the other side of the property which would have trapped dust. A west wind spewed their cement dust onto my property. System Pavers did not make any attempt to contain their dust or clean up the mess that they knew that they created.

An employee of System Pavers came to my home last week and I spent about an hour talking with him. I gained a lot of insight and knowledge of their business practices. I was frustrated about the mess that they leave and wanted to learn why they do not use any containment practices, I did my research and asked about several ways to control construction dust and why they do not use any of them. My first question was why they do not use a silt fence around their saw, he explained that the dust blows around it and it is not very useful.

We then discussed a special vacuum tool that would clean the mess up as the bricks are being sawed, but they have incompatible equipment and were not ready to invest in it. I then mentioned that they could position the saw so that the home itself would block the construction debris, but he countered that with the employees walking too far carrying bricks. I finally asked the employee about putting a tent around the saw and his next excuse was that  tents were not big enough. I have seen many large tents so this did not make sense and sounded like a cop out.

I brought the System Pavers employee into my back yard and showed him some of the debris that remained after hours of cleanup. He took photos of some of the mess and my contact information and promised to discuss this with his management team and get a cleanup crew out to my home. I never heard back from him after he left my house.

I have noticed a lot of good reviews for System Pavers and I believe it is because they report negative reviews to get them removed. If you look at their reviews on Facebook the numbers tell a different story. I want to provide detail about my about my experiences both as a customer soliciting bids, as an observer of their business practices, and finally one on one at my home so that they can improve and be considerate.

Please be nice to the neighbors and environment and insist on clean construction practices.< /review>

The library is a welcoming, comfortable place. There are many services offered by a friendly, knowledgeable  staff, most of whom are volunteers. They are constantly updating and expanding the services and providing informative displays. I am happy to support the library through tax dollars and The Friends of the Library book  sale.</text>

There is no frigate like a book
To take us lands away,
Nor any coursers like a page
Of prancing poetry.
This traverse may the poorest take
Without oppress of toll;
How frugal is the chariot
That bears a human soul!
~ Emily Dickensen

There is no better place than a library, and Chico library is full of helpful, friendly and knowledgeable people whose love of reading and serving their community is heroic.<//text>

Today experience might have been on a slow day for this store or there just under staff. There was only one person on the sales floor today and didnt feel as if I got as much help as I needed for what I was looking for the customer service today was below well below average for a shoe retailer. I love the options you have for kids tho but far as for adult men nothing really was eye appealing. But hey who knows maybe with more staff and better customer service I could have walked out with a pair of shoes maybe even two.< /Text>

<Text>I was in the Grass Valley store on Christmas eve at 5 pm; and was very thankful they had stayed open late, but expected the staff to be a skeleton crew and end of day grumpy. A very pleasant young lady that wore glasses that I was pleasantly impressed with her helpfulness and honesty. Very pleasant experience.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<username>Empress OfCoco< /username><review>The staff is friendly and helpful, the  Store is clean.  But they have the same stock as the local moment pop stores. Such as Empire Shoes and Yuba Blue in Grass Valley and Fur Traders in Nevada City. As usual I'll support my local mom and pop stores first.</review>< pics>

< review>
After my 83 year-old mother and I came into this store to buy shoes for my two kids, the store manager was extremely rude to us over the shopping cart my mom had with her. When my mom explained that we were doing some more shopping and having the cart helped to relieve the pain she was feeling in her knee, the manager screamed at us to get out. Apparently, the needs of this store's insurance company is more important than the customers who are ready to spend money and potentially come back again and again to spend even more money. Due to the unprofessional and uncaring attitude of the store management here, we won't be coming back ever again. Stores that turn away paying customers won't last very long in this tough competitive environment. The owners of this location need to get their priorities in check or risk going out of business for good. The ironic thing is that after we left, we went over to JC Penney just a few stores over and found and purchased the exact same Nike shoes for an even better price but without the bad management attitude and hassle. Bye bye Famous Footwear.< /review>

This is one of the best stores I've been to in a long time. Mainly because the staff was extremely helpful. They checked on us periodically and we're very clear when answering questions I had about items and the myambercrombie account. They really went above and beyond to help us out and make the time we spent there very enjoyable.< /review>

Clean shopping floor.  Shopping environment is comfortable.  It's a bit dark inside, but it's the style.  Price is ok.  Check out speed is a bit slow.  Credit cards accepted.  Employees are basically nice and friendly.  Public restrooms nearby in short walking distance.  Free parking available.<//Review>

The girl at the check out called me a whale under her breath to another girl working there. Needless to say, I returned the item I bought because that was rediculous.<//Review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>They have zero regards for their clients. No one answers the phone and their website is blocked so that no ones sends a request. Wasted my time filling out a request when no matter what robot avoidance code you enter, it rejects your request all the time. There is absolutely no way to communicate with them. They just collect the money and hide their heads. Zero reliability.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Horrible experice with the entire company. They have been unresponsive and they have no sense of responsibility to their clients. Our HOA dispute has been lingering for almost a year and as a reslut of their mismanagemnt has cost us tens of thousands of dollars in land holding costs. My father in law passed away before we could build his dream home now his wife is left picking up the pieces of a project stalled due to a COVID death, all the while being dragged along by Lordon Property Management and their employee F.Sanchez. I wou;d advise styrongly againt ever using them in any capacity as they do not have the time, skill set or dedication to handle anything.<//review>

I have found the staff of some departments to be exceptional, and in others departments just fine.  Overall the services the association receives are quite good.  Whenever there is a situation in need of special attention, my go-to person is Donalea.  Never has she let me down, she has always been very responsive, supportive, and professional in her responses.</Text>< pics>

< review>
The team members try to blame home owners for the mistakes of the board members and charge fees for having something at the patio. They don’t fix anything at all during water leaking pipes outside. They don’t care if home owners have to pay $1,000 water bills.< /review>

<Text>Horrible member services.  It’s been 2 years now, and services are getting worse the more comfortable Lordon is getting.  I have worked with the Covina locations VP, and the Hillcrest location. Both do not return emails and wait untill you file complaint letters for regular service. They play with the financial numbers and don’t provide invoices to members as required.
They purposely overstep the Association and set passwords on your Association accounts that Lordon is the only one who can access.
This eventually leads to more mess ups with your elections which gives them a solid hold into your association and funds.
Stay far from this company and learn from our
Disaster.  Find a different one.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Lordon has to be the worst HOA management company I have ever encountered. They do not follow the law and gives zero support to HOA members. Let them manage and you will go broke.<//Review>

If you are thinking about using this company, don’t.
I went to pick up some keys at an arranged appointment.  My items weren’t ready, the girl I was supposed to speak to wasn’t available.
After waiting 20 minutes another girl got me my keys, I asked her to follow up and look into a parking pass and she told me she couldn’t help me and that I should  email the company.
I asked her if she could just handle the follow up since I was standing in the office and she said she would not.
This is the type of service and attitude you can expect at Lordon management.</text>

The good reviews are difficult to believe.  They really are near worthless.  They don't return calls.  It's difficult to get through to anyone who can answer your questions.  If you're able to get anyone, and ask a question; it's like they just started in business and have never been asked a question before.  Other times, the people are on lunch or break, so call back.  Then when you call back, no one answers!  The first thing that pops into my mind, is this is the place to work!  You don't have to do anything and you're not accountable for anything.  Combined with long lunches and breaks!
I think those 5 star reviews are setups and planted reviews.  Look at the other reviews and notice the consistency in no return calls, difficult to get a hold of.  Do you think these are planted reviews or the good ones?  Judge for yourself.<//Text>

I really appreciate how professional they have been with me thus far. They have handled everything I've called about in such a timely manner, I was truly impressed. Donalea was so nice and really helpful when I spoke to her. I have a hard time believing all these bad reviews since I have never personally had anything but a pleasant experience with everyone here. Keep up the great work and thanks for everything! :)<//Review>

Service has been very poor at best. Getting information from this company seems to be like pulling teeth. I live in a community that has gate access and we pay to have this feature. It is always down and in need of maintenance. It serves us right to have a company manage a property from so far away.</review>

<text>Wow. I can not believe Brittany at London even has a job in customer service. I have never been hung up on in my face. My 1st experience  was to ask about the elevator which has been broken for a year then it was In regards to the filthy stairs it's like your walking in skid row which both times she hung up on me. She talks like she wasn't raised with an ounce if manners an it shows an also discriminates on ppl of any ethnic background the racism that comes from this office is tolerated because several complaints have been made. I'm sure if this building was in o.c an not long beach the attitude an discusting behavior she has would be different  she literally  said because I'm a renter who pays over 2000 in rent wasn't allowed to ask questions or be treated with respect. Shame on you lordon for allowing that type if behavior. 460 golden ave if your looking for a place here go else where you will hate to come home to dirty stairs no elevator an very very horrible customer service from  this office</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>Trying to reach anyone here is the worst, you leave messages they don't return calls.  Last night the so called Security company they contracted to monitor our property was assaulting his girlfriend while driving through our complex??? I've been calling since 8:30am and finally called again and spoke with someone about this company and my concern about who's patrolling our property and how safe it is now??? Are they not supposed to be keeping things like this from happening.....< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c3291b095b7fd9:0xc39929c924536798<//gmap_id></record>

<name>Philip Dennison<//name><pictures>None< /pictures><text>I really can't say anything positive about them.   Every maintenance issue (no matter how small) takes at least three phone calls and three weeks to accomplish.  Their responses are often flip and dismissive.  Follow-through is nonexistent unless you keep calling them.  Sometimes you have to be demanding and use a threatening tone to get anything done.  So they're a very typical property management company - which is to say terrible.< /text>< Date>

We have lived in a community managed by this company for less than two years. In no way would we ever move into a community managed by them ever again. At this point we are convinced the care they give to the residents in the communities they feel they rule is the last thing they really care about. We are left feeling we will have to put what we thought was our dream home up for sale to escape this unscrupulous and horrible community management.< /text>

<Review>Lordon Management Has been representing the Retreat Corona HOA and the senior manager on the account is Josephine Perez.   Her inability to management and lead the HOA Board Members has caused various unethical practices in the form of election fraud, excessive legal fees, unexplained journal entries on our balance sheet and abusive power and mismanagement.  Please stay away from this company when seeking HOA management.<//Review></record>

I have gone to many hearing places in the last 20 years. including ones that are used by the entertainment community. Whittier Hearing is the FIRST one to try to help you with the best possible way for you to hear, instead of just trying to sell you hearing aids.  they spend time with you and work to make your best hearing happen. then provide the best hearing aids for you.<//review>

Updated: I came in to get a hearing test done upon a PIH ENT doctors recommendation. My condition: heavy high-pitched ringing in my ear, followed by loss of hearing, which also triggered some major vertigo. If you've ever felt what vertigo is like, you know it's not good at all, so now try imagining this for a whole day of constant world spinning. This kind of symptom requires urgent care and a solid professional outlook. These guys were great at their assessment, and definitely delivered. Also, the Doctor's were extremely sweet and made you feel comfortable. I really appreciated the details of their explanation on what was happening to me. Initially, I was frustrated because I thought they never followed up with the hospital, but that wasn't the case at all. They were on top of things and Dr. Gilbert even called me to ask how I was doing. If all goes well with my treatment, I would definitely like to come back here and do a retest because these guys are awesome!<//Text>

I have had a hearing problem for along time, during this time I went to several other Hearing Centers but at that time I found them very expensive. I finally couldn't deal with not being able to hear so again went to a specialist that recommended me to Whittier Hearing Center. I'm so glad that I went there, the receptionists were so pleasant, the person we spoke to her name was Liz was so helpful she explained what it was that I needed (hearing aids) and showed me the different hearing aids they had to offer, explained the cost and how they work and which one would be best for me. I'm so glad I went to Whittier Hearing.<//review>

I had the pleasure to be seen by Dr. Brian Hoang. He was extremely knowledgeable and explained everything to me in a way where I understood it. Not only that, but he's very passionate about helping the patient. He does his best to understand the patient's needs and their concern and addresses it with the upmost care.

I highly recommend this center not just because of their pleasant and helpful staff, but because they have great doctors like Dr. Brian Hoang.< /Review>

Thank you Whittier Hearing Center, you have been a game changer.  My family is very pleased.  I'm not second guessing what was said in conversations.  I hear more clearly without annoying background noises.  The aids that were chosen for me are very comfortable; I even forget I'm wearing them.  Sounds are very natural.  The entire staff of Whittier Hearing was friendly and helpful.  I didn't feel pressured into buying something I didn't need.  I felt like the staff understood my budget and hearing needs too.  They worked with me and found the best solution.  I am soooo grateful!  Not only can I hear more clearly, my aids link to my iphone, and I can respond hands free while driving.  Very easy.  Also, I like that I can listen to Pandora through my aids at work and not disturb others.  Wow, didn't realize how FUN hearing aids could be.  I highly recommend Whittier Hearing for anyone with a hearing loss.  They have been in business a long time and have perfected quality patient care.< /text>

< review>
Went on a Sunday for brunch. Ordered the Fully Loaded Steak n' Eggs. Steak was rare and eggs sunny side up. Steak was cooked perfectly and was pleasantly surprised that it was also seasoned well. I did not have to add extra salt as it was perfect from the kitchen. Also ordered a Raise The Gin.  They definitely did not skimp on the alcohol.  I would definitely eat here again!<//review>

<review>THE BEST FRIED CALAMARI I'VE EVER HAD!
Holy cow. I think I really found a gem in Chula Vista!! The food was amazing!! Ended up having 4 drinks. They were amazing. The mixologist is truly a master. I love that they make a lot of the ingredients in their drinks and the menu is very farm to table forward. The Ceaser Salad was very very good! I can't wait to come back and try the fried chicken...and the rest of the menu. I will be booking a dinner reservation very very soon here.
Was very easy to have a working lunch. It's quiet outside and had great music inside. The ambiance of the inside is incredible. Also a plus is Parking was also soooo nice. They have dedicated spots for this restaurant.

I love you guys have a day drinks menu.. but now I need the entire night drinks menu.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8LpkrdUvOeSmqGooiZQWkH5nt_A9u64knVvim=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsMPjHabNB1qc6qjD03GpOMfm9Ao97IM85N22h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnRLRiEEVf7k_o7ocoIlcq8P4-CTCd32Xo1m2-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPp5OhzmN9iYPmKSnXI0OrCurn-ZBesEjFMZ9Mr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvI3I_fZL83WqiKfWWRJNse3WC00dcCZBt3Hzy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6_knPrXpWg07JLhZRZdKrHNvReKjsK6NVbg4I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODc4TCq_wEm3X09JfjjMcjM7APEYTlt3rM260n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8uozi8Eqedy-ODOJOmW9G3JfWTDOIya2sMXf-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>{'time': 1621021059511, 'text': 'Dawn, thank you so much for your review!

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>The place looks nice. Had the calamari. Very tiny and thin pieces, mostly batter. The octopus was not bad. Not much on the plate other than the octopus and some sweet potato puree. The super lump crab pasta had no sign of crab and was flavorless. Pineapple cocktail was not impressive at all. After paying for everything (way overpriced) I asked about the crab that was supposed to be super and lumpy.... waiter asked chef, and chef said the crab was in the sauce. I guess it's liquefied because there was no crab meat. Food took too long to come out and the menu seems pretty boring. Had high hopes for this place.</review>< Name>

There was no crab visible it was supposed to be in a gorgonzola sauce with pesto and basil. No flavor at all no pesto and no basil. Nothing we ordered came as described on the menu. Extremely Disappointing! Too bad!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Great Service and food!!!  There was a Saxxy Saxaphone Singer and he did so awesome at 6pm I think, Thursdays.  Also, the food was out of this world!!!!    Cauliflower soup, chicken tacos, calamari and pork belly.  We all shared.  The Chef put his heart in it!!!⚘< /review>

This place is one of the best places to get breakfast and catch up with friends and family. Amazing atmosphere, amazing food. Even something as simple as the temperature indoor and outdoor was amazing. Waiter was very polite and ready to serve. I come here often and recommend to all. To get parking you'll have to be driving south on 3rd Ave to get into the parking structure which is free!</Review>

I had the chicken fried burger which was so good, especially the chipotle aioli. My husband and friend had omelette that both enjoyed and good size too. The presentation of the chilaquiles plate was unexpected (very pretty) and delicious. Coffee cups were refilled constantly and waiters were checking up on us which we appreciated. Live music was very entertaining. Looking forward to our next visit!</text>< Pictures>

Now that I moved to Chula Vista, this is my go to spot for dates. Not sure there is any other cocktail bar/restaurant like it. The food is so good, I took a date here who is a chef and picky as ever and he loved the food. The menu has many choices, the staff are awesome as well. The ambiance...those fire pits just set a mood and make you order a 3rd drink. It is amazing in here.
Now, let's get to the live music. I got to listen to RnB/Jazz artist Jason Brown and OMG!! Not sure why I didn't know this man before but he was singing right to my soul with that saxophone! Every time I have gone the music is fantastic and just sets the mood, but Jason takes it.
Shake and muddle, never change! I will be back, over an over again.<//review>

<Text>Definitely not kid friendly and expensive for what you get. Took 45 min to get our drinks (came after apps were done), over 2 hours for main course to arrive, two of those were cold. Server knew they messed up and was avoiding us which made things worse  She also strongly encouraged us to order fried chicken for the kids instead of pasta and it came out last and was super spicy so then we had hungry crying kids after 2 hours of waiting. Auto charged 20% gratuity (table of 7 with 3 small kids) was salt in the wound after being ignored all night. My parents wanted to leave after the appetizers with no drinks and I should have listened to them. If you have kids, save your money and sanity... Go to La Bella's down the street.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>
{'time': 1619888979701, 'text': 'Good morning Ryan Bray,\n\nFirst off thank you for taking the time to write your review.\n\nPlease know that we do take the time to read and understand each and every customer concern not only to correct them with our wait staff but to be sure when given a (1) Star that it\'s indeed valid. We do apologize for all the mishaps that occurred during your visit to Shake & Muddle yesterday, Friday, April 30th. We will be taking down "KID FRIENDLY" from Google Ads -- even though we do offer the huge "Mickey Mouse Pancakes" for Breakfast and even though our locals love them! However, you are right, on a busy Friday night when all the young locals come out to drink and enjoy Live Music it is very disruptive for (3) small children to focus on eating and behaving at our tables with the night life distractions. If we could we do suggest a daytime seating is best. Our Lead Waitress handled you, your lovely wife, your parents, and (3) small children as best as she possibly could. The apps did take a bit longer but at no point did you wait 45 minutes. That is an exaggeration to say the least. But yes, Friday nights are very busy but last night it was busier than usual and for that she did apologized. She brought (3) rounds of drinks as fast as they could make them. The fried chicken, the pasta, and the fries were all merely suggestions not strong encouragements for your children to eat. Your server was never at any point in time avoiding your table - but she was indeed handling her entire section and it was a full house. We apologize and we do wish that you recognize that the Manager took the Fried Chicken "OFF" your bill and that you were provided with a complimentary dessert. We also removed the 20% gratuity.\n\nThis is casual fine dining and we thank you again for your feedback. Have a great weekend!'}<//resp>

This spot is close to my home, so I've been here a few times already. I have to say I enjoy the cozy feel. The owner/ manager is a well traveled person, so those details reflect in the atmosphere of the restraunt. I've had different items on the menu, the watermelon salad is light, refreshing. The half chicken is a big meal, full of favor and cooked perfectly, to me. Great cocktails, okay wine. I love how they have "specials". Meaning the chef may offer something each week that is not typically on the menu. I had a grilled fish that was awesome. The whole fish! This place does many if the little things right. Five stars.< /Review>

<Gmap_id>0x80d94e0a23ee992b:0x6153d08bfd92d229< /Gmap_id><text>I wasn’t expecting to do much this year for my birthday, so when my girlfriend suggested this spot I got excited. We made a reservation.

The ambiance was the first thing we noticed, then the DJ. This place is nice. It has unique lighting and decor, a great bar, and outdoor patio.

I love Old Fashioned’s, so when they told me they had five different types, I knew I would have a good time. I don’t remember all of them(I had fun) but I do remember a Japan and Mexico take on the Old Fashioned, I tried the Mexico version and was instantly hooked. If you love this drink, this take on it is a must try.

We ordered the Calamari appetizer and it’s huge. You will love it. It comes with fried shrimp and zucchini. The calamari rings weren’t forkable(it’s a word if you Google it). Either that or that second Old Fashioned had kicked in already.

Our waitress suggested the Hot Fried Chicken with Mac n Cheese. Taste so good, make you wanna slap ya momma(I would never haha). Seriously though, everything we tried was good and I enjoyed all of it. A perfect birthday dinner.

Our waitress was great too! I can’t remember her name though. I was was New Fashioned by the time we left.

Thank you, Shake & Muddle!<//text><rate>5<//rate>< Pics>

Had the American breakfast and the French toast was soggy and the eggs used a LOT of white cheese. Owner took it back and I ordered something else. When she brought the bill, I was charged for the breakfast. When asked about it, she said “I personally didn’t think anything was wrong with it even though you didn’t eat it so I left it”. Thanks for the experience< /Review>

Shake & Muddle is amazing.  My wife and I celebrated a rare night out in this new normal.  A Thursday date night is exactly what we needed and Alex and his crew delivered.  Thank you for the invite.  I am a now loyal follower.  Katya was warm, kind and very friendly. There was plenty of spaced seating and precautions were taken.  We felt safe and cared for.
As for the food and drinks.....
We were recommended to order the specialty drinks made by the MIXOLOGIST, not a bartender.  I ordered an Old Fashioned made to perfection and my wife took Katya's advice and ordered the Raspberry Kentucky Mule.  She later ordered a Hibiscus Pineapple drink that was stellar.  After we destroyed the huge appetizer plate full of Crispy Calamari, we shared the Ribeye medium rare and the Southern Style Fried Chicken with Cornbread.  The steak must have been aged as it melted like butter.  Because of the large portioning we had to take the other half home and I got a treat for lunch the following day.
I can't wait to go back and order different drinks, appetizers and plates.  More leftovers!

Make sure you go on Thursdays to catch the Live Saxophone set to updated pop music.  We really needed this high end restaurant in the South Bay.  I wish Shake & Muddle success so that we can keep coming back for more.</Text>

I wanted something tasty but not too heavy, and they had a perfect happy hour menu (it's only available in the bar area though) - I got the mac and cheese octopus (yes, you read that right) and it was phenomenal! And for me, the perfect portion for a light dinner. Unfortunately I didn't get a drink, but the bartender, Jeff, was very friendly and knowledgeable, remembered my name after only asking once, and had some great recommendations! I hope to be back again!</Text>< Pics>

For this 4 course meal the featured items are; pork rib nachos, grilled octopus with a jalapeno hummus, a bison burger, and Churro donuts with a strawberry compote and a caramel sauce compliment. It was all delicious! The octopus was soft and crunchy all at once. The nachos were hardy and had the perfect thin cut potatoes for a different nacho experience. The burger was on point and had some type of spicy sauce which I love. Finally, the Churros were perfect! This restaurant has been open for only a few weeks. The decor and the service is great. I see it being a hidden gem in the South Bay for the near future.< /Review>< userid>

While on vacation in London i tried 5-10 coffee shops in total, searching for places with highest rating near my current location. Kaffeine had the best cappuccino of the places I tried (better than e.g. Timberyard in my opinion), and on my second visit to Kaffeine I had a salami brioche which was very good (soft and fresh). My taste in coffee is drawn towards intense and bitter flavors, not towards fruity and sweet, so if you have the same taste, this is a good place for you.<//Review>

This place tho! We had an awesome night at Shake & Muddle last night. Everything was on point, the environment, vibes, omg the fooood and specially the service. We didn’t reserved a table but Katya (one of the servers) got us a table, she and the whole staff were super friendly, attentive and welcoming. We were having such a great time that we even forgot to take a picture of our food, but I got the grilled octopus and my friend the Mahi street tacos, both delicious!< /Review>

We eat here a lot and have never been disappointed. The service is always good, they are friendly and always have a smile on their face. The food is always delicious. I haven't tried anything I didn't like there. I especially love their boom boom shrimp, salmon and ribeye. The only complaint would be once in a while the drinks take a little longer than normal but it's not everytime.
I highly recommend Shake and Muddle, it's a great addition to the Chula Vista community.<//text>

This is a welcome change from the one-dimensional food choices in Chula Vista.  Imagine a New American restaurant in Mission Hills or North Park.  The food and drinks were excellent (viva the Ring of Fire), the service was very friendly, and the vibe was great.  I really hope this place stays around because it's what Chula Vista needs.<//Text>

<Review>The food was pretty good but the service tonight was a 2-3 out of 10. Waitress was very inattentive to our table and neighboring tables. Ordered drinks, appetizers, and food. Received all out of order. After sitting for 38 mins, and receiving our food (after waiting for another 8 mins); we had to ask a gentleman bussing the tables to get us silverware. She asked us if we wanted more water after we asked for the check. If you want to try the food, order take out.</Review>< Pictures>

Old fashioned parts store that has everything you need.  If they don't have it in stock, they'll have it in a couple of hours.   Just call ahead and have them hold what you need under you name and your are in and out in 5 minutes.

Steve is my go-to guy and he always delivers.  But they are all really good and super nice.  I just like dealing with one person everytime.

Give  Steve a raise!   He deserves it!<//Text>< Rate>

This is the best auto glass repair shop in San Bernardino. My left back passenger window regulator was broken. They were able to fix it real fast and my windows works great now. They clean the sticky tape mark from the tape I used to hold the window in place. I am very happy with the quality of the service, the price was great. If any of my car window is broken in the future, I will come back here with no hesitation. Thank you Soto's Auto Glass!<//Review>

A rock hit my windshield one morning and left a nice little chip in the center. I checked out Yelp and saw great reviews for National Auto Glass----and they were right! A warm, family-owned business, my car was examined and repaired by the owner himself. It only took about 40 mins: very feasible on a lunch hour. I definitely recommend this place to any in a similar bind!</Text>

I called on a Saturday to make an appointment for the following Monday morning. On Monday, I waited for an hour after the scheduled appointment and when I called to asked where the service man was, the lady seemed as though they forgot about my appointment. Then asked if I could wait till the service man got here because he still had to go pick up the glass. No apology or courtesy phone call about there tardiness. Yes, Soto's is inexpensive, but the added cost of precision and professionalism is worth the money from another company.<//text><response>None<//response>< userid>

Even tho she did 3 times! She even gave me a different car model and year. And when i corrected her she acted like That's what she had already said. Just terrible lying skills. The only reason i let them service my car was because they were the only ones who had the window on hand. And when it was done. The rubber on the side of the window was rolled in. And the window was a bit sideways. They just said that's the regulator. But i just left. Didn't want to deal with them anymore.</review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Very good service and good price. Before you go anywhere even if they say their slogan "the best prices", go first with Soto's Auto Glass, I highly recommend it.

< Review>
It was my first time visiting this chain. And goodness, it was good.

Straight of the bat you noticed just how busy the location is.  Service was great and although food did take a while (understandable, considering just how busy it was) it was well worth the wait.

Simply good, although presentation needs to be worked on.< /Review>

If you haven't tried in and out yet it is time. while the menu seems small there is so much you can customize. lone animal style, love well crispy fries. So many options. Also very consistent food quality between stores. Its not the best burger but one of the better fast food burgers.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOr4c7sEFUQI6yQOXDK5iWomkpFq0Pn6UfXVBTj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipME5uLrAfxFHaK2QWaaO17ji4FlrDWcnHacJfeW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

They’re still doing burgers, fries and shakes the right way. As long as they don’t start selling chicken and salad and beans and toys and playgrounds and veggies and fish, they’ll be fine. Keep it simple, do that thing right.</Text>

<name>Carrie Baarns</name><Date>1618888433521< /Date><rating>5< /rating><text>Ordered inside and there were very few people waiting, even at 7:30pm. In fact it was so quick and efficient to order that I forgot I was pescatarian and ordered my old habitual order: hamburger, no tomato, grilled onions, fries, and Arnold Palmer. Old habits die hard. What I'd meant to order was the drink plus fries with spread and grilled onions. Completely my mistake, and I didn't realize until I was waiting for the order to come out, but I went back up the employee and he made sure the spread and grilled onions were added, at no extra charge. (I apologized to the cow, but it will probably still wreak its vengeance on me since I haven't eaten meat in eight months.)< /text>< pictures>

French fries were really soft and not tasty.
Burger okay but nothing special. In my opinion there are better fast food chains to find.
Definitely not worth the time spent waiting.< /review>

I noticed that the food quality in In-N-Out is always consistent anywhere you'd dine (California and Nevada) so that's a given.This branch has more welcoming staff though. We arrived a bit early for their opening time but someone walked to us and asked us if we were waiting; as we said yes, he told us that they'll be opening 10 minutes ahead of schedule so we won't have to wait for a long time.<//review>

< Review>
where's the distinctive In-N-Out burger "aroma"?   gone?   i've gone 3x to this joint and it disappoints:  burgers were thin & rather dry;  "animal" style was with soggy FRIED "sweet" onion rings;  french fries were thin no longer plump & fresh-smelling.  twice twas that bad; once, it was good BUT the short receipt(?) was placed on top of my fries!!!  so sorry.< /Review>

This is a fast food burger joint that you only find in southern California. They supposedly only use fresh, unfrozen ingredients. They have a very limited menu of burgers or cheese burgers with fries and soda. The burgers are tasty, but I wasn't sure what to think of their fries. While they were fresh, hot and crispy, they were lacking a bit of inner softness. They weren't bad, just different.<//Text>

They were pretty busy both inside and the drive thru but their service was very quick! Their fries tasted a bit stale like they were sitting out too long or double fried to reheat. Otherwise the burgers were pretty good.</Review>

You can tell how good In-N-Out is by the giant line that snakes out into the street and blocks traffic, I love your guys's burgers but you have to manage the line, there's plenty of room for it in the parking lot if you put up cones or something<//text>

The customer service and food are always 👌 💎💎💎💎💎 top notch. BE WARNED they moved the drive thru line. You can't just pull up to the drive thru anymore. The traffic was getting out of hand that they are having you loop and form the line in the far end of the parking lot..... I'm having a hard time 😪 explaining it. I'll add a picture next time. The employees are awesome, and they WILL remove you from the line if you "accidentally" cut in line.</review>

Almost always great food. I love fries made to your liking (ie. Light well done). Burgers are okay, and shakes are amazing!</text>

< Review>
This is a fast food burger joint that you only find in southern California. They supposedly only use fresh, unfrozen ingredients. They have a very limited menu of burgers or cheese burgers with fries and soda. The burgers are tasty, but I wasn't sure what to think of their fries. While they were fresh, hot and crispy, they were lacking a bit of inner softness. They weren't bad, just different.</Review>

The burgers are good. Not great, not bad, maybe a bit above average. Not cheap, but not overly expensive either. Fries are made from fresh cut potatoes.  Service is relatively quick.
Menu is very limited and simple: burgers and fries. I always get my burgers "without spread and protien style"<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgf1-aUvp2pT_XducX2b-kYShVxzkoVq9tO4Ni=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVYftsceKEAKTmKxOhzKwErlctlhAYZ9nZTy4M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMj2LxNwgikDmcbFf-ZAUfXPCTmwvMf9HbUcy_L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dc72facbfe7dcb:0xcbe6e129e7b54885</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Clean restaurant, fast service! This location is great and very convenient when you're at the beach!!There was a bit of a mix up with our orders and one was forgotten about and never made. The manager Raul apologized profusely and made up for it with a free milkshake. Customer service like that is why we will be back!< /text>

<Review>As a midwesterner, I always hold a special place in my heart for in-n-out. I truly do think Californians take it for granted. Their burgers are simply amazing for the price, time, and scale of their chain. No matter what location you visit the quality remains the same. Its really impressive.

My order is always the same: double-double with fries, all animal style, on the burger: sub chopped onion for a whole grilled onion, mustard grilled patties, and extra toasted bun.

Cant go wrong.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Great burgers and fries at excellent prices!
Always clean and filled with extremely pleasant employees. Even though their restaurants are always filled with lots of people, the orders always come out fast and prepared correctly. This food chain is an excellent example of how fast food restaurants should be.<//Review><gmapID>0x80dc72facbfe7dcb:0xcbe6e129e7b54885<//gmapID><user>108414060927393536723< /user>< Date>

Super consistent branch! Floating staff members will help you find a table when busy, clean it all off for you, and then bring you your food when it comes out (rather than you having to get up and get it at the counter). This was really convenient with little kids; great service!<//text>

Had double burger protien style. Which comes without a bun. It's great for keto or low carb. They replaced w bun with iceberg lettuce. Delicious.< /text>

<review>OK, listen up! You want a great burger, fries and a shake? Drive over to this In-N-Out Burger place. They take your order while they're in this short line of cars, and by the time you get to the window to pay, they've got your food, cooked hot, and ready to go. What a concept, hot, fresh, good takeout burgers at a good price, and FAST? These guys are OK!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<Text>In n out is hands down one of the best kept gems of the west coast. The friendly faces greeting you always at the door and the super quick serive that rocks. The hidden not so hidden menu to just put that extra twist on the best food ever. Fresh fries fresh meat. The greatest milkshakes hands down. It's a perfect date spot, quick eat, and very kid friendly. Bathrooms are always very well kept.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<response>None<//response><review>Today we ordered a coffee and were told they would brew it and bring it to us. A few moments after my order was called, I got up and asked for a knife and fork. It was then that an employee asked me if I had received the coffee, when I politely answered: no, not yet, He proceeded to contradict me and told me he was almost sure I had gotten it. Again I patiently replied with a No, we have not received a coffee yet. He then doubted me once again and asked if I was sure about not receiving it. He also reassured me that he thought I had gotten it. I then looked over at my table and for the third time said nope, don't have it. Finally, he gave me the coffee. This experience certainly did not make me feel like a valued customer. I'm just disappointed in the fact that I almost had to make him walk over there to prove that I had not received an item I paid for and had not yet received.</review><Rating>2< /Rating><user_name>Angel Garduno<//user_name><UserId.>107136492580068972964</UserId.><gmap_id>0x80dc72facbfe7dcb:0xcbe6e129e7b54885</gmap_id>< time>

If you like cheese, spread, and onions, then try the fries "animal style".</Review>

The California's In-N-Out signature red Palm trees serves as eye candy for the hungry tum tum!!!

For the uninitiated non-Californian, I suggest the double double protein style no bun if you want a messy treat.

For those who want a mild adventure, get the starter burger meal #3.

Fries are great!  If you want extra crunch ask!   Golden brown fried - no salt!

Great holy Mother Church help us not to lurch with our brains drained of common sense!

Our Lady of Good Success, triumph and reign!

Blessed Fulton Sheen, pray for us!< /review>

Although I am a pescatarian now, I still remember how much I love am In and Out burger and the whole experience of it. One of my favourite things to do when visiting the San Diego area is to drive to this particular In and Out and then go to the Premium Outlets. Total guilty pleasure! If there is any type of meat that can sway me, it's a protein style double cheeseburger.< /Text>

<Review>We were a group of 12 and managed to find seating together! Our large order was made quickly and correctly so thank you to efficient front counter and kitchen staff.

OMG...the burgers melt in your mouth. My son doesn't eat burgers but he ate one everyday we went to Lego Land. There is a McDonald down the street but he didn't want that. It was In and Out Burgers for him.<//text>

Amazing! Roger was so friendly and welcoming.  He was fast, efficient and personable.  I went with family for a midnight snack and it was a great experience.  I'd love to stop by again!

The food was fresh.  It was just as tasty as their location in San Francisco :)  I love how consistent In & Out is across Cali <3<//review>

Terrible.  Worst in-n-out experience ever. Food was so salty that we all feel like throwing up and our tongues are raw. Nobody finished their food.< /Review>

What can I say that hasn't been said before.  As soon as we land back in California we head to In-N-Out.  Give me a double, double. Fries and chocolate shake.  No one else seems to be able to match them for their simple menu and delicious burgers.<//text>

<Review>Dinning area is a bit dirty.  Pretty crowded most of the time.  Employees are basically nice and friendly.  Ordering speed is normal, but serve speed is a bit long.  Foods tasted not bad.  Credit cards accepted.  Public restrooms available.  Free parking lot available.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Name>Arthur Cheng< /Name>< Rating>

First experience at IN-N-OUT Burger. Wish we had them on the east coast.  Food was fresh and the portions were large. Liked how as you pulled into the drive through the kitchen was open so you could see them preparing the food.</text>

Everyone else line up behind me! It feels so good to be recognized as In N Out's #1 customer.

I'd just like to use this time to thank my appetite, my unwavering committment in taking down a 3x3, and of course the good folks at In N Out.

Thank you for this most prestigious honor. I promise to make you proud.</Text>

Great place to eat a burger and fries! Although the burgers are starting to not look and taste good like they used to do them. Fries are still great though! Professional staff that keep the place clean.

You can't go wrong by having In-N-Out burgers anytime of the week. Just pure AWESOME burgers. Love the customer service at this location, all the staff is doing a great job and let's not forget the guys who cook the burgers too, just a shoot out to all the cooks ( Thank You )

Place is very clean, tables and outside of the building.

Thank you In-N-Out burger for being here in Carlsbad, CA

<text>It's a good hamburger, I had mine with whole onions and peppers to give it a nice zing. For some reason even though the fries are made right there on the premises, I don't like them. Oh I also tried the root beer float, wasn't right it was Arie rather than soft serve with root beer over the top.<//text>< pictures>

Great food for an amazing price. I really like how clean every In-N-Out is. They have a really retro style that's hard not to like. Everything is made fresh to order, so it can take a while especially if someone puts in a big order before you.
If you have a choice, pick your location, I have to been to some locations and it was so busy it almost want worth it.
Overall I really like In-N-Out, and don't forget to look up the secret menu before you go.< /review>

<Review>I've been eating at In-N-Out since the 80's. I've always ordered animal style and now that I can't have gluten, I order protein style as well. I love the burgers and make a point of going to In-N-Out every single time I'm in California, which is several times each year.

I don't know how they manage to hire consistently cheerful employees, but I've never had a rude or grumpy server, ever. The food is consistent across the dozen or so different locations I've been to, and I haven't ever been disappointed. The free stickers, hats, and window decals are super fun, too!<//Review>< date>

Great food for an amazing price. I really like how clean every In-N-Out is. They have a really retro style that's hard not to like. Everything is made fresh to order, so it can take a while especially if someone puts in a big order before you.
If you have a choice, pick your location, I have to been to some locations and it was so busy it almost want worth it.
Overall I really like In-N-Out, and don't forget to look up the secret menu before you go.< /Review>

As good as fast food gets! You gotta love the menu: hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, drinks. Layer as many patties as you want, but that's it. Simple, specialized, delicious. Always fresh California beef, French fries made from real Idaho potatoes cut on the spot, and fast service equals lots of happy customers. There's a reason people are so crazy about In-N-Out. Yum!< /review>

The service was very friendly, efficiency was high - they kept the line moving steadily. Of course everything was fresh as can be. The fries were deliciously hot & fresh - but I mistakenly forgot to order them without salt - they were still good - but too salty for my taste.</Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>Never fully understand the excitement around In-N-Out Burger. Personally, for the price I feel other more specialty burger places beat it soundly. But, alas, we dont have a lot of them where I am from so perhaps that is it. Went here while on a biz trip for a quick meal on a friday. Food average. Service not super fast to be honest, but that seems to be typical of an In-N-Out. There is a nostalgia with the hats and the decor which is cool. No doubt. Shake was delicious. Parking lot tight which is a good sign for the restaurant. Good location near freeway exit too. So all in all a good experience, but not worth the hype IMHO. Go here or another location for the nostalgia and the fun. But after that try some of the other ones. IMHO Five Guys is way better.<//Review>< user_id>

Great burgers! Order your fries extra crispy and go online to check out their "secret" menu. Animal style is very popular and I always order the fries extra crispy. There is usually a line, but it moves very quickly and the staff are very friendly and efficient. They make the milkshakes fresh and they are very good.</review>

< Review>
The drive-thru at this location is quite impressive. The wait was minimal, especially in comparison to the other four locations I've visited pretty frequently. The staff was really friendly which is standard across all of the other In-N-Out restaurants. The food is consistently good. The only thing that varies a little bit is the French fries. Sometimes they can be a bit crunchy for my taste. But that's nothing a good old animal style can't fix. Top notch!<//Review>

Location is tucked away from freeway so less traffic in/around the store. Average size In-N-Out. The Dbl-Dbl Animal Style was great as usual.</review>

GREAT fast food, really fast! Order a 4x4, protein-style...lotta meat, lotta cheese, no bun...yum, yum! Fries, not so much. Don't know what they do to them, not so good unless you eat them right away. 'Course, that's kinda the point with French fries, anyway, isn't it?</Review>

UPDATE so one of the best In N Outs. I will eat there over anywhere else on my way home from Legoland even if I think I just had in and out or maybe I'd like to spend a little less money I go there cuz I know what I'm going to get there Services fast they're always friendly and I always get greeted with a smile and I really appreciate that seen the consistency of the expectation of the company.

One of the greatest InNOuts I've been to</review>

Best burgers in town!  Lines are usually manageable because they have employees outside taking orders, even in the rain.  As with most In-N-Outs, the employees are always polite and friendly, which is quite a treat these days.<//Review>

It's In n out.
It's Clean
They have great food & fast, friendly service.
Gets a little packed after Legoland closes.
If they are under staffed the tables might get a little grimy, (Kids and all) but other than that it's what you would expect from In N Out.<//Text>

Restaurant was exceptionally clean, staff was courteous and helpful. Food was good for what it is. It's a burger joint. Burgers are a good size and obviously made from fresh beef, not a frozen patty. Get the animal upgrade, it's worth it.<//Text>

If you need a review for In N Out, then you're not from around here and should stop by immediately. Straight up one of the most consistently delicious burgers hand down. They don't nickle and dime you for making it your way. Off menu items as well and tubes of spread, pickles, jalapenos, if you ask. Enjoy!</review>

<Review>As an East Coaster, I don't get all the fuss. Have been to 2 now, one on N Cal and one in So. Cal. Burgers are fine. Nothing to get excited about. But the fries are trash like eating cardboard. We threw away more than we ate. Very overrated.< /Review>< pics>

Simple menu, no frills.  What they do serve tasted excellent so as long as you know what they serve, you'll enjoy it.  Crowded but cashier's/managers moved the line quickly.  Extremely clean.<//Text>

<review>In-N-Out is a staple among Californians. You'll be hard-pressed to not find an In-N-Out along the 5 freeway, and this another one in Carlsbad, CA opposite the outlets. Inside, you'll see the iconic red and white tiling and decor. Like most In-N-Out's, it's usually busy-especially on the weekends when tourists are in town. Nothing really unique about this In-N-Out.< /review>< pics>

From the person that greets you in line to take your order in the drive thru to the person who provides your completed meal, all are very friendly and helpful to ensure your order is correct and you have everything you need to enjoy your meal.  Great burgers for that setting. The carmelized onions are a great addition to the flavor profile.<//review>

<Text>Happy camper here. Drove down from LA on empty stomach and it’s past 5:00pm!!!  I’m about to collapse... In n Out sounds too damn good! And it was! I’m probably small percentage of people don’t like In-n-out spread... I tried it but, the mayo n ketchup thing was way too Canadian for my taste! I love the beauty of customizing at In-n-Out, no spread, grilled onion. No salt on the fries!!! I devoured that food in a second! LOL!!! Friendly service here. I‘m In-n-Out 4 life😆< /Text>< gmap_id>

<Review>Who doesn't like a good burger from in and out? This is a really great inn n out because it isn't super crowded like others and we didn't have to wait a very long time for our food.  Its clean and parking is very easy here.< /Review>< date>

This was our 1st visit to California & everyone said you need to try the In-N-Out while you are there. They were right, very unique place with good food. We were with my wife's mom (who is not a fast food fan) & she loved it. Even talked us into going back a 2nd time before we flew home. Nice place to go.</Review>

The food was as expected, fresh, tasty and hot. What was even better was the effort they made to keep the restaurant clean
One young lady by the name of Demara never stopped moving. She brought my food to my table, cleaned up a spilled order of fries and then replaced them with a new order. Great corporate leadership.</Review>

These guys are on it! This place was so busy last night and orders were running so smooth! The guy who was calling out numbers....he was on it too!

Without a doubt the worst hamburger franchise in the known world. The menu seems to consist of one item - a burger to which you can add cheese or another burger. The vegetarian burger consists of (I kiss you not) of the employee taking the beef Patty out and giving you the rest of the burger. The fries look like something from the 80s. Yet they seem to be very popular. Strange place California at times.< /text>

Awesome In-N-Out burger! The staff are great and the location is killer. It will get very busy because it's near the I-5 and the outlet mall. The food is amazing too. Worth a weekly visit.<//review>

Love this place! Food is made to order, staff is very helpful, and it's not over priced. I only wish they would bring some In-N-out Burger locations to Minnesota! California is too far.< /Review>

Why??!!! Someone tell me why there's a line here? The burger's like white castle but not in a good way. They're tiny, little, nothing of a burger. Fries taste like styrofoam, yucch!< /Text>

What can you say about In-N-Out? Each one is basically the same, which is especially noticeable because whenever my daughter and I go to a different one, she asks if we've been there before. But that isn't a bad thing. You get the same A+ customer service and expected food, one of the best quick-service burgers, fries, and shake you can get.</text>

<Review>Best spot ever, I LOVE IN N OUT. but this expirence was even better. Manager Austin opened half hour earlier since he say us waiting outside. No other restaurant chain would have ever done that. Only mom and paps restaurants and we all know those are dinosaurs.  Shout out from COLORADO. Wish I could help bring one to Denver :)</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
My daughter did not want to eat what we were eating, so we stopped here as it was on the way home.  The drive-thru had a line of about 15 cars, but we were too tired to go in, so it was worth it.

She loved her hamburger, pickles and spread only, and chocolate milk shake.  I ended up getting a pink lemonade, and naturally loved it.  It wasn't as sweet as usual, but was a good thing.</Review>

Burger was ok... A little on the cold side.
What I'd really like to know is, what happened to the fries? They used they used to be fresh and crisp!!! And the animal fries were the best!! Now they're just soggy and have no taste. The animal fries are like an experiment blew up..... Not good....< /text>

This place is my favorite "joint"! The employees are incredibly kind and friendly, The cashiers are more enthusiastic about their jobs than a Disneyland cast member! The food is...  How can I put this...  Clean!  It tastes fresh and clean and delicious!  There's a reason for those long lines! Bravo In-N-Out!<//text>

Good burgers.  Recently was asked the magic words "would u like some "spread" packets?"  Didnt know what it was but took some.  This is what makes it a good tasting burger.  Only way to get a better burger is to get a #2 Whataburger and add this spread to it.  Then utopia!<//review>

<Review>We just moved to California and had heard from others that we NEEDED to try it. Having eaten many many cheeseburgers over the years I wasn't expecting greatness but greatness is what I got. The burger, fries, and shakes were all on point and it was soooooooo cheap for the quality. I am a believer.<//Review><rate>5< /rate>< date>

After many visits to various in n out burgers, including Texas, this was the first time we had a negative experience.  We went through the drive thru.  Our order was not correct even after trying to get it right twice.  There was no sauce on the burgers and we asked for ketchup with our fries and we were given one packet for three orders of fries.  I hope this was a rare experience for this particular in n out.  We not return.<//Text>

Voted best fast food chain many times. I always to to one when Im in a state that has them.
The reason they are in AZ, CA, NV is because everything is delivered fresh daily, no frozen ingredients.
Thats most likely big part of their delicious food.< /text>

This place was busy and so took a long time for my off-the-secret-menu order. But the quality was up to the usual in-n-out standards and the service was super cheery and helpful. Restaurant was clean but super full, and the carpark was a bit of a pain.</Text>

The best items from the In-n-Out secret menu are:
1. Whole grilled onions
2. Animal-style fries

Grab those two things once in awhile and prepare for an instant boost to your quality of life. You're welcome.<//Review>

The burgers here are really delicious and also paired with a non fat fries which are not fried. The price are very reasonable as well as the wait considering that the place are always crowded. This is a place you would consider on coming back always.</review>

<text>Dear California,
Please quit romantisizing about how this place is good or by any means quality, this place is garbage and everybody but you knows it. This is a poor excuse for food in general let alone fast food, you look ridiculous supporting an obnoxious imitation of quality food such as this. Drunk me couldn't even ride home with the smell of this garbage in the car let alone eat it. You look stupid passing this off as a staple or landmark of sorts just stop it's absurd. Very poor, and that's a generous statement.<//text>< pics>

Every other time when I order 🍔 4x4 cheeseburger & ask for “well done”, meat patties come out pink-ish.
My recommendations for those who want to get something larger, than double burger,
do it by eating-in. At least when eating-in, you’ll be able to get a replacement without a need to drive back to In-N-Out.<//review>

I just had the worst cheese fries i have ever had from in-n-out.  They were cold, one felt frozen and the fries were super hard.  Never had this experience before.  My grilled cheese was also not warm.  Even during busy hours, i get a decent in-n-meal no matter the location.  This location is a disappointment.< /Text>

Terrible service I've been to many in and outs and as a school bus driver bringing 30 to 40 students here to eat after a sports meet always been given a free burger but not this time manager was rude said no more free burgers for school bus drivers here they just lost our business at all stores. I called corporate office and they said sorry can't help your school</Text>

I was amazed how busy it was and how each employee was hustling to everybody's food out without anybody going back to complain. That place ran like a well oiled machine.</Review>

<Review>The go-to in n out for most of carlsbad. They always handle the Friday rushes of both high schools very well and there’s rarely ever too long of a wait even when a hundred people show up at ~9.

As per California covid restrictions season 2 they still allow in store ordering with a mask which is much faster than the drive thru, but no indoor dining.</Review>< pictures>

As always with In and Out, the quality is consistantly outstanding and the burger makings are fresh.  The staff here was well trained, positive and enthusiastic to service to my satisfaction.   And the cost of the "pup patties" for my dog friends is reasonable and less expensive that other fast food drive throughs when  I've ordered for my own "pup"...in several cases in other fast food drive throughs, the patties were cold, not freshingly cooked and seemed have been seasoned. They are unseasoned and fresh at I-&-O! Woof!</Text>

As per California covid restrictions season 2 they still allow in store ordering with a mask which is much faster than the drive thru, but no indoor dining.</text>< response>

One time I had the biggest craving for in and out. And it just so happen that my cuz called me and invited me to go have lunch. In my heart I was like yes! Time for in and out.
But after he showed up my cuz said lets go have sushi.
Maann I was so bummed.
Especially since I never had sushi before.
I felt like an unmasked Luche libre sitting eating raw fish with chop sticks. After that I told my cuzz if he keeps messing around like this ima get him a Chinese name.< /review>
