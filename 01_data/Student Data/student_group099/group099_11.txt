I saw all the good reviews and was very suspicious. How can a place be that good? Well, I just had my first appointment, and I can confirm Rincon is the nicest dental office I have ever been to. Everyone is super smart and thoughtful. Mia, the office coordinator, was extremely welcoming and I didn’t have to wait at all to start my appointment. Arlene, the x-ray tech, is probably the sweetest person I’ve ever met. Dr. Byun was kind and thorough and even polished off a stain I was insecure about. Martina, the dental hygienist, was so nice and didn’t make me feel ashamed about my terrible flossing habits but took the time to listen to my anxieties and educate me. 10/10 would recommend.<//review>

I love Doctor Byun and his staff, Mia, Victoria and Charlene are amazing. I went to see them after I had a bad experience at another dental office. Rincon dental was recommended by a friend and it really was a life saver for me. I went in very scared and feeling unwell, and I left with a smile on my face. The doctor told me exactly what was going on and gave me all the information that I needed and the recommendation for an oral surgeon. He’s the best dentist I’ve ever been to, he talks with the patient and explains everything, he’s a professional, I will send all my friends to him and his lovely staff.< /text>

I HATE going to the dentist. But I left my first appointment feeling amazing!! Location is very convenient, a few blocks from Embarcadero BART. the staff is super knowledgeable and very open by explaining everything they are going to do before they do it. Which put me at ease. Also everything was very efficient. I was in and out in 1 hr. For x-rays and a cleaning. I might actually be looking forward to my next cleaning in 6. months!<//Review>

I loved my experience with Rincon Dental. From the front desk to the hygienists to the dentist, everyone was an absolute treat to be around.  Not only did everyone have great character, but the work is superb. I left with my teeth feeling clean and polished. They listen to your concerns and offer solutions rather than pushing product. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who is looking for a dentist office.<//Text>

<review>Consistently the best dental office I have ever been to. The staff is extremely friendly and professional and Dr Byun is awesome! I've had bad experiences with prior dentists where they tried to sell me on unnecessary procedures and equipment but not once has this happened here and I've been coming for years even after several moves where the office was no longer close to me. Whenever I have asked him if I needed the procedures previously recommended to me, he examined my teeth and told me he would obviously do them if I wanted but that they were not needed. This level of honesty and integrity is greatly appreciated. My dental health has been perfect since I started coming here and this will be my dentist for as long as he decides to keep his practice! Couldn't recommend him more.</review>< Pics>

<review>Dr. Byun and his staff were outstanding.  I chipped two of my teeth in a bicycle accident the night before and they were able to get me in the very next morning and fix it right then and there.  Super efficient check-in process and they explained all the details including how much it would cost to make sure I was comfortable with it all.  Within a couple of hours, I had a brand new smile that looked as good as new.  I would highly recommend this dental office - thanks again for my new smile!</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>I've only had 3 dentist in my life, but Steven  is the best. What I get from him is that he is not only very good at what he does but also explains everything to me and I get this feeling that everything is perfect after he has finished his procedures. I had front veneers from another dentist and they kept popping off and I had to pay for them to be replaced! I went to Steven, he replaced all but one of them and 3 years later they are still there and perfect. Can't think of a better dentist!< /review>< user_name>

<review>I usually dread dentist visits but my first visit to Dr.Steven Byun's office was absolutely amazing. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by my first name (which really impressed me) and the staff made me feel so welcomed and loved! They consistently checked in on me to ensure I was comfortable and if I needed anything. I never thought I would leave the dentist feeling happy and energized but Rincon Dental proved me wrong.</review><user_id>114940387394830431880<//user_id><Response>None< /Response><time>1438275031631<//time><Name>Danielle Potter</Name>< Pictures>

<review>Rincon dental you're a diamond in the rough
You're a straight shooter with no fuss
You don't try to upsell to get an extra buck
So finding you I hit good luck

Came in here worrying what kind of dentist they would be. But they are great. In and out, no frills, straight check ups, cleanings and you're out.  The hygienists are awesome and the whole experience is great.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< rate>

I've been coming to Dr. Byun's office for a few years now. He does a great job and does not push to do unnecessary work, which I've experienced with other dentists in the area. I've had a few cavities and crowns put in by him, and have been very happy with his work. Recommend.</text>

As usual, I know the reason for any task performed by staff as they all take the time to explain each step,consider facts regarding pros and cons to assist the patient to make any decision. I have been with Rincon Dental for over 15 years.The human touch, the professional attitude of all staff, and utilization of up to date tools assures the "healing" for myself and others I've referred.</text>

NOT recommended - I had a very negative experience with the receptionist at Rincon Dental when I inquired about scheduling a cleaning appointment.
1. The receptionist would not even discuss availability for dental exam or cleaning without verifying my insurance policy, name, BOD, ID, etc. all over the phone.
2. When I politely suggest that we should check availability first before proceeding to sign up as a new customer, she literally says with attitude "YOU KNOW WHAT, I DONT THINK WE ARE THE RIGHT PRACTICE FOR YOU" and proceeds to hang up on me.
Needless to say, I'll be vocally expressing my discomfort and discontent to the benefits team of my employer with 90K+ employees as they clearly don't want new customers.< /text>

<response>{'time': 1552406590812, 'text': 'Hi James-before we schedule anyone we need to get proper information about you and whatever insurance company you are covered under.  This is fairly standard policy and I am sorry if  this made you feel uncomfortable. I wish you best of luck in finding another dental office that can satisfy your needs better than we could. Take care.'}<//response>< gmap_id>

WOW.  I am tired of care providers dictating terms.  I have teeth that are in great shape, have had only one small cavity my entire life, and don't eat processed sugar.  I'm at a low risk of dental decay and don't particularly feel like paying $200 for x-rays since I've had dental insurance with minimal coverage.  When I explained this to the doctor, he just told me that he wanted to mitigate his risk exposure.  I told him, "why should I pay to mitigate your risk exposure for a service I don't want?"  That's the end of that.  Like other reviewers have mentioned he also doesn't show up for half of the cleanings.....so maybe he should start by actually seeing patients as a means of mitigating risk exposure.

The front desk staff is lovely and so are all the dental hygienists.< /Review>< pictures>

<response>{'time': 1509555827418, 'text': "Hi Jenny- As I explained I need periodic xrays to be able to diagnose what I can't see visually. While it's typical to do them every year we are flexible on this and are willing to go every 3 years on people that are low risk. This is crucial to maintain a high standard of care as. Also I am not a hygienist so I don't actually do the cleanings but I come and do the exams at the end of cleaning appointments twice a year. I hope you have had good luck with finding an office that is better suited to your preferences. Take care!"}< /response><gmap_id>0x8085806503a535cb:0xea2faee9e1bc84ad</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Byun has been consistently efficient and good at follow-up for the three years I've been seeing him for routine cleanings and a sports injury.  Both times I've been in because of dental pain he looked for the least invasive solution first and checked in on me afterwards.< /text>

This was the best dentist visit I have had in memory.  I am usually very resistant to Novocain - so getting a filling usually comes with some pain - especially at the beginning.  Dr. Byun listened as I explained this and told me he would take extra care.  He asked be to raise my hand if I felt anything... and I never had to raise it once.  Unprecedented!

Dr. Byun and his staff were friendly, efficient, and very accommodating to my cowardice.  My next cleaning was scheduled before I even left the chair!

My mouth and I are very happy to have found Rincon Dental!<//Review>

I relocated to San Francisco in 2000 and had not seen a dentist in 2 years.  Needless to say I had A LOT of dental work in my new future in this great Cit-tay.  I was  recommended to Dr. Steve by a friend who went to Dental School with him.  Dr. Steve rocks!  I used to be a huge dental chicken but Dr. Steve put me at ease and was real reasonable with his pricing.  He really helped me out when I was in a freak accident and lost part of my front teeth.  Dr. Steve put them back together and they look better than they did before.  I've gotten to know the ladies in the office as well over the last 10 years and they are sweet as apple pie.  Dr. Steve now has  TV's on the ceiling so you can watch 30 Rock while you get your teeth cleaned.  Way to be so 2011 Dr.Steve!<//review>

I've been seeing them for about 15 years (as has my wife) and recommend them very highly for all dental services, especially for folks who work (or live) in the Embarcadero/SOMA neighborhood. The hygienists are skilled and very reliable, and I appreciate Dr. Byun's general professionalism along with his direct and balanced approach to describing and providing dental care options (e.g., identifying but not pushing hard on minor but expensive cosmetic adjustments). My latest cleaning appointment was a great example of their superior service -- I was short on time, and they got me in and out quickly without sacrificing quality. Thanks!<//text>

<username>Deanna Titsch</username><Review>ABSOLUTE BEST! Referred by my numerous office mates who see Dr. Byun. First, I am total DENTIST-PHOBE! Dr. Byun and his staff put me at ease immediately. My appointment started off with a lovely x-ray technician/dental assistant (who's name I'm ashamed to say I don't remember), who's bubbly personality alleviated my self-induced stress. She took my X-rays, and then paged Dr. Byun who came in for the evaluation of the x-rays and examination. Interesting aside: my dentist in Boston told me I had a broken tooth - which I thought very odd because I have no pain, or even sensitivity. Dr. Byun respectfully disagreed and gave me the all clear! He even took the time to go over the x-ray of each tooth I was concerned about. Most importantly to me, he was also VERY patient and understanding about my dentist anxiety. GREAT EXPERIENCE! Highly recommend to all, but especially for those with dental appointment anxiety!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><time>1393954163183< /time><Rate>5<//Rate>< gmapID>

<Text>One of the male vets at the florin location was very rude to my wife. Our normal location is Arden but they had temporarily shut down due to a case of covid the day our dog was scheduled for her addison's shot. So we were left to call around looking for other banfields to give it to her. Florin and rancho locations would not see her so we went to the crocker location who could see us. Unfortunately they did not have the shot to give her since they didn't currently have any addison's dogs so they don't carry it. They made us an appointment with florin 2 days later and assured us our dog would be ok going the 2 extra days without the shot. So we go to the florin location and the vet criticizes my wife for bringing our dog in 2 days late even though they were the first ones we called and we're denied a visit. On top of that the vet was overly adamant about getting our dog spayed to the point where it was rude. I really hope our normal banfield office is back open by her next visit because we do not want to have to go to the florin location again.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Expensive and they don't care if it's an emergency if you don't have the all money they won't help with anything really. I was charged about $380 my dog's ear half riped off. All they did was give us some pills and clean it a little. Then said she needs way more work but we need our payment. Sine I didn't have it all the only did what I could pay then at that moment. No caring at all my dog looked like she was going die. I was mortified about this . Had to find someone else to help and did thank God.<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< Time>

The staff & veterinarian were very caring & professional when we needed to put our cat to sleep. They got us in ASAP & dealt with the unfortunate situation with compassion and kindness which was much appreciated. We have seen 2 different vets at the Florin clinic and they were both superb. I highly recommend this site.< /text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>Dr. Brianna Paiva is a GEM! You are so lucky to have her in Sacramento!! She took amazing care of my babies at Banfield in Connecticut this past year, and helped me put my beloved 13-year-old Maltese Anabelle to sleep when it was time. Dr. Paiva handled it PERFECTLY. She was gentle, kind, sensitive, patient, and loving. I will always remember her for these qualities during what was one of the most painful experiences of my life.
Dr. Paiva made it bearable.
Dr. Paiva is an OUTSTANDING VETERINARIAN, truly one of a kind.<//text>< Time>

I continue having issues with this Banfield. They call me to set up biannual exams. I never receive a call the night before to confirm. I learned today that the reason why I don't receive those calls is because they never actually scheduled the appointment. It wasn't a situation where they scheduled it on a diff day and I was mistaken. They just failed to schedule it. If this had just happened today, I would consider it a simple mistake and give them the benefit of the doubt, but this is two times in a row. The response I have gotten from both Banfields that I have taken my dogs to had been that they are a busy location and it must have just been an oversight, yet how can it be an oversight when they have developed a pattern of doing this? They even called me to set up the appointment. Is it an issue of negligence rather than a simple mistake? Its starting to seem that way.

I have had my dogs on Wellness plans with them for over 6 years with my oldest dog and 4 years with my youngest.

I don't know what it is with Banfield locations in Sacramento. I moved here from Utah where I had a great repore with my Banfield docs and I trusted them. The front desk people always got my appointments right and followed up with a call the day before to confirm appointments. I never had an issue. My trust is shaky with Banfield in Sacramento, yet I can't cancel my Wellness plans with them or else they will back charge me for all the included services. They need to send their people to my old location in Utah to see how a Banfield should operate.< /text>

<Review>Stopped in here yesterday for a couple of drinks.  Super awesome place.  Talked with the manager for a bit, she was very nice, and makes some really good drinks.  It has that "dive bar" feel without actually being a dive.  Everything was clean, comfortable, relaxed.  Their karaoke guy was really good.  We didn't eat there, but they had the grill going and it smelled amazing.

I would definitely go back.  You should check it out.< /Review>< Name>

Magnificent. Super friendly staff, great signature drinks by the glass or pitcher. High quality food vendors. Never a dull moment when you add karaoke and beer pong into the mix.</Review>

Secluded, open air gay bar tucked away across the street from Liberty Station. Strong drinks, and good burgers. Crowd is less mainstream, but fun time.< /Text>

That being said, an hour long wait is inexcusable on our part. Please reach out to our email at theholeinthewallsandiego@gmail.com and we will see what we can do to rectify this situation. Thanks again and have a great day.'}<//response>

What ana amazing, fun, inclusive bar.  This place serves up awesome drinks in mini pitchers for not expensive at all.  The bartenders are top notch.  And the abspulte best part.  The burger.  Get the frigin burger and have that moment of divinity that you've always been hoping for.  It's amazing.  Just go here and stop looking at reviews.<//review>

Great food and friendly people.  Only open inside the hole in the wall bar for now on Thursdays.  Highly recommended.  Their food is delicious and amazing and you are supporting a new business born out of covid.

You will not be disappointed.

Amazing home cooked deliciousness.< /Review>

Are you looking for the best place to have some chill and a good laugh at night? Try them here! This is the best place for party-goers because they had beautiful and masterful beats of music. Their DJ was talented. Even I can't dance, I jive and join the fun with my friends whenever I hear their music. Everyone here is having a good time!<//Review>

The Hole has been a home away from home for years. When the covid shutdown hit I was terrified that The Hole could be a casualty. Not only have they survived and reopened but they have found a way to follow the reopening guidelines and still make it a good time.
I didn't think that it was possible to be fun and safe, I've never been so glad to be wrong.
The drinks are huge, the staff is super friendly, and karaoke is a blast. If I listed everything I love about this place I'd just end up listing everything about it.

Go for a karaoke night and Sunday Funday.</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I adore this place. Drinks are cheap. Staff is great. Very unique dive bar and I enjoy it very much and feel welcome here. *edited to add* I’ve met the love of my life here. This amazing man who makes the most delicious burgers that sing to my heart and feed my soul. The patty is THICKKK freshly formed ground beef with the right amount of fat. Grilled onions, bacon, avocado, and fresh veggie toppings are all available with a perfectly toasted onion bun. There is no better burger in San Diego, I promise you. I would accept a marriage proposal from this man solely based on his burger craft.<//review>< pics>

<text>Ok, for starters I called about what new policies there were in place after Covid.
Crosby answers the phone and walked us through what was new.
He told me to ask for him upon arrival. Found out he was the owner.
Not only were we taken complete care of by Crosby, but Krista (the GM) spoiled us with her presence but Kieth had the jokes running and made sure to call us by name. We felt so blessed to be served by such a superb staff and it was an affordable fun night. Thanks “Hole” staff, you earned a lifetime customer.<//text>< Time>

Not only were we taken complete care of by Crosby, but Krista (the GM) spoiled us with her presence but Kieth had the jokes running and made sure to call us by name. We felt so blessed to be served by such a superb staff and it was an affordable fun night. Thanks “Hole” staff, you earned a lifetime customer.</text><rating>5<//rating><gmapID>0x80deab02eb5cdf6d:0xb4037646c46b268d< /gmapID><Pictures>None<//Pictures><date>1593841682002< /date><Response>{'time': 1593904063405, 'text': "Thanks for coming by Daniel!

<text>SUNDAY!!! Go on a Sunday. I am not much of a Sunday Funday type of person. I was persuaded to go with a few of my colleagues after work on a Sunday. They were busy. The vibe was festive, fun and in tune with what I would expect for a "HOLE IN THE WALL".

I loved that I could get a small pitcher of beer. I do not like places where I have to order by the pint b/c it seems I order the beer and move to the back of the line just to wait to order another. Maybe I drink the beer too fast or the lines are too long.

I liked the fast service and larger beers here which allowed me to spend more time with my friends.

I havent been back in a while but it will definitely be added back to my Sunday program. I encourage everyone to check it out. Also, please order a hamburger. They are great!< /text><Time>1579429950002<//Time><name>D< /name><gmapID>0x80deab02eb5cdf6d:0xb4037646c46b268d<//gmapID>< user>

I went there with a friend and the College students, the karaoke and the cougars are a very entertaining mix. However, the burgers are I've had in years. They serve pitchers of amazing drinks! Incredible fun at the karaoke sessions. Yes!< /text>

<Text>I went there yesterday for a Brazilian night and it was wonderful!! Definitely one of my best nights in my life. Excellent service by the bartenders, the DJs (girl and man) completely fantastic, amazing songs that you dance and sing, they just just had so much fun playing the songs that was contagious. Amazing structure of the bar keeping everybody outdoors all together. I loved it! Rate 5! Can’t wait to go back. Next time I’m in San Diego this will be my first spot to stop by and have a blast 😎</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1562523539778, 'text': 'Thank you Naiara!

Went here on a Friday evening and there was a good crowd. Drinks are on point and are reasonably price for what you get. Hung out for about 3 hours and met some cool people. Highly recommend if your looking to get out of Hillcrest and still be at a all inclusive gay bar.< /review>

This is a great place to throw an underground party. The owner is totally cool. It's gay bar most of the time I think. But we never go there then. Not that there's anything wrong with that.</Text>

The place is changing, but it's a good thing.  Bartenders are attentive as are the bar backs and security. It gives a nice vibe.  Used to be a regular spot of mine and can get really busy, especially Sundays but it's a great place on off days to have a chill drink and good conversation.< /review>

Probably the best dive bar in San Diego. The last couple years it has started becoming more popular (under new/better management) so I'm giving it one star to try to discourage people from going. If you have read this review, then you've earned the right to know that it is a five star dive bar. Parking sucks though, be warned, take uber or lyft.< /text>

<text>i stopped in at The Hole on Sunday afternoon about 5 pm. Nice crowd. Two lines at the inside bar were 10 deep and not moving.

So I went to the patio bar. As I approached, the bar tender said the patio bar was closed.  He'd just shut it down.  I asked "Why's that?  There are long lines inside."  The bar tender just turned away.  No answer, just attitude.

I went back inside and got in line again. The girls tending bar moved at a snails pace and didn't seem to have a clue what they were doing.

ENOUGH!  I left and relayed this to the man at the entrance.  He was receptive & apologetic, but couldn't explain why the patio had closed.

If this bar is going to make it, it needs to purge the deadwood tending bar.</text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1536572775294, 'text': "Hey Kenneth. I apologize for the bad experience you had at The Hole in the Wall. My name is Crosby. I am the owner and operator and believe me when I say that I take your feedback seriously. If you're willing to give us a second chance, come on in, and ask for me. I will talk with my manager as to why the outside bar is closing while they're such long lines inside. I am never happy to hear about attitude coming from my bartenders and that will be addressed as well. Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback."}</response>< gmap_id>

If you’re not looking for it, you’ll definitely miss it.
And if you ARE looking for it, you still might miss it! It’s really tucked away lower than street-level behind shrubs.

I went for the first time last Saturday for a friend’s birthday, and the karaoke was solid. No cover charge, and not too crowded. Friendly bartender, and pretty cheap drinks.< /Review>

<Text>One of the main reasons I supported this bar was the laid back atmosphere and the bartenders. It was a neighborhood type place where I helped slice limes or collected pitcher and glasses when it was busy. I never gave any problems Always polite and aware of how hard a job it can be so I was never pushy or demanding.
Well all that came to an end as of last Friday, Oct.10th when I was treated as if I was being a nuisance by patiently waiting my turn to order. I was told not once but twice by bartender Shawn to move away from the " ordering area if I wasn' t going to order: I was not holding up a line. What I was was the last person in that bunch to try and place my order.  But before I could he was instructing me to move away.  Now I did not deserve that treatment and found it to be insulting, rude and uncalled for.  It will also be the last time I will be seen at The Hole since I am not valued as a faithful, trouble-free customer. I sure hope the other bartenders will not follow that type of behavior . So enter at your own risk.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

First time in San Diego in almost 5 years and first time here. The food is seriously amazing and seeing the fun that everyone is having with Karaoke on a Friday night makes this a definite must visit in the area< /review>

We went early as we had plans so it was pretty slow, however the layout of the place was great. Could definitely see this place popping in the evening. Bar tender was friendly and drink prices were decent. Outdoor area had a wonderful vibe and there is a pool table.<//Review>

<text>Just went through the drive through and got two drinks...the new blueberry lemonade and the matcha Green tea... the matcha green tea has no matcha green tea what so ever... it’s literally just banana and milk... I ordered one size the 16 and the other 22... both are 16 the same size... paid more and got less... way less.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Enthusiastic happy staff and very clean place. This place is in the corner of Otay Ranch so it is not nearly as busy as other places making quicker and more efficient. Another cool thing is you can switch ingredients that you do not like for other ones. Thank you!< /Review>

<review>A lot of people attempt to make an acai bowl but not all bowls are comparable to each other. Only a few of them stand out and the acai bowl at Jamba Juice does.</review>< Pics>

We were excited for Jana to open on this side. However, they love like molasses!! Every single time I come you’re waiting in the drive thru line forever! They need better management! It seems like a lot of kids are working there with no guidance!</Text>

I feel like every time I go here something ends up wrong with my order. Love the fact they have a drive thru but I think I’ll head to the other location until I hear some improvements from ppl at the gym<//Review>

<text>The first time I came I waited 35 min in the drive thru. Gave it a second chance today and currently at 25 min. It’s ridiculous. I don’t get off because I figured with a baby drive thru is convenient but definitely probably easier to just not come to this location anymore.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Jamba juice millenia is one of the newest locations to the eastlake area. Great place to enjoy a savory blend of you favorite juices. The staff is extremely friendly which makes the environment enjoyable. The seating area is very spacious which would give you a relaxing g experience. The juices in general are great, anything that you could conjure up in your brain I suppose they could make it. If you happen to be in the area, stop in and experience the jamba juice effect.<//review>

<Text>The ONLY reason why I didn’t give them
5 stars is because A worker, kailee, EXTREMELY rude and disrespectful. She was little to no help. She had such a bad attitude and was really unkind to her workers. The other works were kind and helped me just fine the other times I’ve been.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<rating>3</rating><review>The food here is amazing, as is the service. The main challenge I have is the 1/2-1lbs orders of meats. Their scale shows 1lb, but my digital scale showed 7.8 ounce for my pound order. I drove back, and they gave me a larger box without weighing. When I got home I weighed it on a traditional scale and digital scale, both just calibrated,  and it was 11 ounces. Pound is 16ounces. They tried twice and were off both times. The employees said the scale is off, so that makes me question my past orders. I've probably order side meats 10 time in the past 4 months. So I guess I've over paid $70-80??? Idk???
I'm in the industry, you should check your scales weekly, if not daily. Especially since you use them frequently. I'm not writing this for any compensation, I'm  past that point. If anyone orders meat, check it. Catering orders, requested orders, check. I didn't get what I ordered twice. So it can't just be happening to me.</review>< Pictures>

I ordered the carne asada fries. The food was tasty and I was not disappointed. The fries are more kinda like seasoned potatoes. This restaurant is an American style twist on taco shop cuisine. 4 stars are for the simple fact that I wasn’t blown away by anything. But I will be back to try something else...perhaps chicken lol</Review>

Top notch carne asada, but as the name states their chicken is delicious.   If you haven't tried their Buffalo Chicken Fries, you really don't know what you are missing.</Text>

I had the chicken quesadilla supreme. It was good and decently portioned.  For a place called Chicken Lisa the chicken was a little dry. The price as high and on top of that the girl charge me wrong.  I did the math afterwards and it turn out the price she had charged me would only be correct if sales tax is 14%.  Also,  very stingy on the chips.  The salsa dip was great, but no chips to eat it with.  Will only come back if other options is closed.<//text>

<Review>This is still one of my favorite restaurants for any Mexican food that you might look at getting in the Escondido, or North San Diego county area. it is a great little hole in the wall restaurant, with great staff and an awesome menu. If you want or need some great Mexican food, this is the right place to visit!<//Review></record>

I have food allergies, they were very accommidating. They have a salsa bar for your condiment needs. All items prepared fresh..NO LARD. The chicken was excellent! Their cinnamon crisps were amazing. A must for anyone who enjoys good food. Very clean and well appointed atmosphere.< /Text>< Response>

Great chicken ceaser salad. I like having a scoop of their home made corn salad added and I add 3 scoops of home made salsa.  Great taste. Lots of chicken. Good value. Happy employees... my new favorite restaurant</review>

<text>There services and food are great for the most part; but today as I  was eating really enjoying my dinner .  I ran across a long wave hair in my food.  One of the best ways to ruin dinner.  Have not called yet. I'm just extremely disappointed.</text></record>

<Review>Great place, food & location. Chicken Lisa's shares a space with Frankie's Beer & Wine. We ordered taco's and went around to Frankie's for drinks where I had the best Skinny Margarita. The  tacos were not skimpy and service on both sides was fantastic. The location is secluded making this a hidden gem. I will be back again very soon.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Our friends wanted to meet for lunch and suggested Chicken Lisa's. It was our first time and, based on this experience, we will be returning again... soon. The carnitas are delicious with a perfectly crisp exterior and soft interior. The chicken is very flavorful and juicy. The meals are reasonably priced and the portion sizes are great. If you haven't already been there, you really ought to try Chicken Lisa's.</Review><UserId.>106862665913943543720<//UserId.><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Name>Matt Zimmermann<//Name><Date>1567466672255</Date></record>

First time. Had the 3 chicken street tacos w/beans and rice. Very good. Very filling. I was amazed at how much meat was in each.
Will definitely be back.</text>

<text>I love Chicken Lisa's for Mexican food. I am eating a keto diet and love their chicken Fajitas.  What I love most is their ability to make you happy with their menu.  If you want anything prepared a certain way they will do it for you.  I enjoy my Chicken Fajitas with their buffalo sauce and cheese on top.  They are known anywhere in Escondido for their Chicken and their Carnitas.  You will love them too.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Atmosphere:
The parking is a little shoddy, kinda scary at night to be honest because it’s in a center where everything looks dead. But as soon as you walk in the place, you’re greeted with bright and welcoming decoration. It’s very homey and modern with cute decorations. A VERY positive vibe is what you’ll feel.

Price:
Price is just right. The 4 piece combo was under $10 and it comes with two sides and chips.

Food:
Their chicken is literally perfection. Got the 4-piece combo with fries and rice. The skin of the chicken is flavorful and it comes with tortillas and once you make a little burrito with the rice and chicken, it’s PERFECT. Lisa, whoever you are, please don’t stop making good chicken.</Text><UserId.>110498646320745943105<//UserId.>< time>

<review>Chicken Lisa’s has the best rotisserie chicken I’ve ever had in my life. The skin is perfectly seasoned and grilled, and the meat is so tender, juicy, and flavorful. The beans, rice, and fries are all super fresh and delicious as well. The decor was a huge plus, adding such a pleasant, warm atmosphere. The workers are friendly and helpful. Overall a really great place, and I’m very hopeful they’ll expand and open more locations!!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Chicken Lisa's has the best carnitas burrito I've ever had, and I've had a lot of them. I decided to also get a bean and cheese burrito, and that was also a great burrito.  The staff is also friendly, love this place.</review>

This place is right up the street from my boyfriend's house and it's so delicious, it's dangerous to my diet! I love their breakfast burritos. Their menu is exceptional and reasonably priced, and the staff is so warm and friendly. It truly has that hometown cooking vibe as a neighborhood eatery. I'd award six stars if I could.<//Text>

< review>
I stumbled upon this magnificent eatery quite by accident when I deposited some mail at the adjacent postal annex and was hungry for any food. Up to now, Mexican food was an also-ran for me, because my European background caused me to prefer French, Italian and--Heaven help me--even German food. However, one most delicious meal at Lisa's hooked me for good. The efficient and friendly service makes eating there a real treat. For several weeks now, I have had lunch at Lisa's three times a week and was looking for excuses to eat even more often there.
I bet that you would leave from Lisa's place after a meal with similar positive impressions as I had. but it might be a good idea to hurry there for a delectable meal before this little jewel gets so popular that you have to wait a long time before you get served.

<review>I love this place. Very reasonable prices, excellent food, friendly staff and a cozy setting.

Everytime I'm in Escondido I swing by for the buffalo chicken fries or fish burrito which are my mainstays. The chicken, of course, is also amazing.

I suggest you see try it for yourself.<//review><GmapID>0x80db8b464cb8d875:0x99c467c63cd92388<//GmapID><Resp>None<//Resp><name>Aaron Leftwick<//name></record>

Food is good, not great but they serve large portions.
Service is good, not great either.
Prices are a bit high but it balances out with portion size.
However, they charge .35 when you use a debit or credit card regardless of the cost of the meal which is ridiculous to be charged to be charged......
Overall, not good enough for me to go back. Its probably good for locals for convenience.</text>

Great food! Never had any disappointments here.  Don't be fooled by the name "Chicken",  this place makes the bomb shredded beef and carnitas too! They have a little salsa bar too.  I could drink the green sauce!

Updating review:  This place is still awesome!!!  I turn people on to this place regularly, including people who've lived in the neighborhood for decades and did not know about it.  You get large portions of great food at good prices!< /text>

<text>This was our first time eating here and everything was good. My carnitas burrito was so delicious. NO FAT IN IT AT ALL!!! I can really appreciate that. My daughter had the chicken taco salad and she said the chicken was seasoned just right and wasnt dry. I highly suggest this place.</text>< pictures>

<date>1567993759225<//date><Text>i go here very regularly, i live very close. I ordered a California burrito, which i do often, after waiting over 20 minutes, i took my food and went home to find that it wasnt anything close to what i ordered. I called to get my order corrected, and got hung up on, called back and could barely understand the person on the phone, as it kept cutting out bad. but they said they would correct the order. i got back, waited another 5 minutes after returning the breakfast burrito, got no offer of anything to make up for the incorrect order, and after inspecting the burrito, discovered it was just meat cheese and potatoes. i went back AGAIN, becuase ive had these many times, and there is more than just meat cheese and potatoes in a california burrito, but she insisted that that was all they've ever had. so... over $10 for meat cheese and potatoes, and over 45 minutes of waiting. And my gf couldnt even finish her burrrito.... since when does a chicken burrito come stuffed full of carrots?  i really liked this place but to get the order that wrong, then get something thats obviously not the way its always been made, and then told to my face that im wrong... yeah. done</Text>< GmapID>

Very nice, clean and friendly. Very different from the typical taco shop. Food is good as well, not knock your socks off amazing but still pretty good. Big fan of the carnitas and the fresh charbroiled chicken. Also they accept mobile payments which is very cool.</Text>

I have tried the the beef tacos and machaca burrito big thumbs up! Also, the homemade salsa is really loaded with flavor both mild and spicy. The flour tortillas seem to me like almost homemade and they might be. Same with the refried beans which I'm sure are homemade.

Good food, they don't just slap the stuff together. It's hard to find places that really care about the product they put out and you can tell they care and love what they do. Little out of the way but worth the extra mile or 2 to enjoy the great food<//Review>

<Review>Nice people and delicious food at this Chicken Lisa's place. Only two things I didn't love were the fact that it was so hot in there (like they don't use the AC) and that I got some burly heartburn. Might just be me but that was the first time I had it from carnitas (which tasted funktastic!).< /Review>< pics>

Food and service are both pretty good.  I'm not big on fast food, but this place is a step above fast food.  It's good in a pinch, especially given the lack of restraunts around north esco< /review>

I use to go weekly with the entire family between 4-6 people to support local businesses until the last couple times they have put a limit on there salsa cups only allowing 1-2 small cups per item including ordering a taco salad that does not come with any dressing. The only way to get salsa is buy it for an additional cost.</Text>

<review>Super good food.   Mexican. And they have grilled chicken that everyone buys . Lots of people just order and take out.  Good flavor and a nice place in general. Clean too

Update.  the last three (3) times I've gone my taco and tostada were not crisp. I even asked the girl ( same one Everytime) if I could get it crispier...I don't think she listens or ??? It never improved.  And she never said " sure no problem" so you give the tip when you pay and end up with chewy taco and tostada.   Help!  A year ago they were always perfectly cooked.<//review>< Time>

<Review>First time trying the place, I ordered and sadly I didn't get my food 20 minutes later.  Workers looked at me and didn't bother asking anything, I was standing and then I sat down. I had to get going before Amazon called me saying my lunch is over, I get up and that's when they finally said something, I was going to leave without my food because I had no other choice basically. I get to my van and try the food, it was cold....bad first experience.</Review>< resp>

Off the beaten path and tucked into a little mini-mall, but well worth the effort to find.

You can tell this place is quality the moment you walk in. It's clean and well-decorated with attention to detail and it also smells wonderful.  Friendly employees, too.  Another good sign.

We tried the taco salad with chicken, the carnitas burrito and the chicken taquitos.  Everything was outstanding.

Everything was also made to order.  You can watch them deep fry the tortilla shell for the taco salad and cook and cut up the roasted chicken while you wait.

The carnitas in the burrito were incredibly juicy and flavorful and the tortilla was fresh.  The chicken taquitos were enormous and tasted terrific.  We ordered a side of chips and those were fresh, too.

Even the salsas in the salsa bar were clearly homemade and delicious.

This is so, so much more than a taco shop.  In fact, it's not a taco shop at all. Aside from the Mexican food items, their strength is likely their roasted chicken dishes which we will try next time.

And there will be a next time.<//text>< Pictures>

My son raved about this place, so I ordered lunch. I ordered a Simple Carne Asada Burrito.  It just was not very good.  They put tons of lettuce, beans etc... not enough Carne, they forgot the guac and I asked for cheese, they forgot that too.  I would not recommend.</Review>

I found out about chicken lisas from a fb group. I had no idea this great place was so close to home! 4 minutes to be exact. Great food, HUGE portions at athe same priceif not cheaper then your typical albertos style shop. Food was delicious. My aunt with a sensitive stomach loved it and she keeps asking me what the dishes were called so she can order it again lol.<//text>

<date>1543399090884< /date><rate>1</rate><Text>I once came here and the General Manager was so beyond rude. I went to pick up my food from the counter and asked if they had waba sauce and the manager pointed to the side so i can get it from there ... Okay sure , so i went and the waba bottle was empty so i went back to tell her there wasnt any and she rolled her eyes at me and grunted walking to go see if there was any.. So i went back to my table to check on my kids and this woman says " excuse me " from all the way across the room so now everyone in the store was staring at me and she very rudely says " theres some right here " trying to make me feel like i was stupid for not seeing a pump ... But in my defense there were 4 bottle sauces 1 said waba and it was empty .. I was embaressed cause everyone was looking at me and i simply asked her for her name and she pointed at her hat i believe her name was maria. She definitely needs to be retrained on her customer service skills.< /Text><user_name>Jalene R<//user_name>< userid>

Alfonso is the man! He towed our broken down Camper from Idyllwild to Phoenix on very short notice. He sent pictures to us from pickup to delivery and made the process very easy and pain free. We would recommend Alfonso to all our friends in a second. Very personal service from beginning to end! He saved the day... and change a stressful situation into a nice interaction.
Thanks so Much Alfonso!!!! A Job well done!!< /Text>

They had a vacant slot so collected it 30 minutes after I called.  The driver (Luis) was very friendly and efficient.  Charged $150 which i think is pretty reasonable.

Alfonso, is a great guy. He has dome of the best prices around, specially if you need a Medium Duty Tow. Like Box Trucks, RV's, Heavy Service Trucks. With his sons and other drivers it is a great team of hard working guys, who like to help.
He tows all my customers trucks, here @ "California Diesel Services", he is our go to guy for local tows.</review>

When my roadside service towing company left me waiting over 1.5hours, canceled with them. Googled nearby tow companies and Alfonso towing popped up. Called and they arrived within the time limit stated. Luis was very pleasant and efficient! We went from Whitewater to Cathedral City, price was very reasonable. Would definitely recommend! Ask for Luis!< /Review>

< Review>
I called Alfonso after another tow truck driver showed up and started demanding way more money then he'd quoted.  Alfonso offered me a flat rate that was even cheaper than the other guy's original quote.  Luis and Alfonso showed up very quickly.  So fast, actually, that they beat me getting back to the car.  When I arrived I was so happy to find that they had already solved the problem, and were just waiting to greet me.  It was obviously a difficult task but they made short work of it, and they did not charge me any more than they'd quoted (even though both of them came just to get it done!)  I'm so happy that I ended up finding them, and I highly recommend Alfonso to anyone who needs a tow!<//Review>

I called to see about buying a vehicle they told me to show up at 230. I called at 2 to let them know I was on my way. I drove 30 miles to come see this truck they had for sale. I get there and the gate is locked. No big deal so I call to let them know I am there. I get told that no one is there and I have to wait at least an hour and a half to see the vehicle. Vehicle wasn't what they had described and had a bunch more miles than conveyed. They said there was no issues but when I finally get to drive the car the transmission is slipping like crazy. Worst experience of my life trying to buy a car and I have had some bad experiences. After all is said and done my car bottomed out on the road out and I was backed into by someone who lived down the same road. I don't recommend using this company ever.< /text>

<review>0 stars!!!!Called to get a tow for my RV from one location to another. I spoke with Alfonso and he gave me a price of $350 flat from one location to the other with no additional rate. Once we got to our destination his worker told him he was going to charge us an additional $190 for the hour he spent taking the hitch off his truck and wouldn't leave until he got the money! My husband called Alfonso to settle the matter by saying we were not told there was additional payment for them to hook up and unhook the RV. Alfonso the owner then proceeded to cuss out my husband over the phone! Very rude very disrespectful and very unprofessional. I would not use this service again. They are not honest about their prices.</review>< Pics>

Called and they quoted me $70 from DHS to PD. Never said cash or Credit price difference. And once I got to the destination and gave them my credit card the drive said our machine is 'broken'. And the 'owner' (over the phone) said bank of America sent us a new machine. And I fought it saying yeah no, you never said that, and eventually their machine 'started' working. And then they go on and say it's  $70 for cash and $80 for credit card. Never told me that over the phone. And I was charged from Clover not Bank of the America. Yeah okay...<//Text>

<review>Only thing I hate is having to find parking in this area but that has nothing to do with the service of this optometry! They are so professional and excellent customer service every time I’ve come. I live in Hayward so I make about a 20-25 min drive for my appointments nonetheless they’re incredible. Their selection on glasses is great as well and their prices aren’t bad.

Guys and girls working here are quick and extremely nice.

Huge selection of frames.

No fuss, in-n-out with my examination and new frames.</Text>

I’ve been here twice! The location is very convenient. I wasn’t able to schedule my appointment online but they were very responsive when I called and got me in right away. My exam was quick and I love the selection of frames available. They were also able to break down my insurance coverage and even took my old frames and put new lenses in them.< /text>

They have built in precautions for COVID including having patients line up outside, only one to two patients inside the office at a time, everyone is masked and easy accessibility to hand sanitizers. I saw Dr Lu who did a fantastic job with my hard contact fitting and glasses prescription. Prices were also very reasonable. I will definitely return in the future!</text>< Pics>

<Review>It's always a good sign when they're always busy. Got tired of having fogged up glasses. Got an appointment and was able to have an exam and be prescribed contacts same day. I'm new to contacts and they had mine in stock and they provided a great lesson in-house on how to put them on and take them off. They have bilingual staff and take my insurance VSP. I also orded glasses with transition lenses and was able to pick them up in about a week.</Review><username>Tiffany Rose Naputi Lacsado<//username><rate>5</rate>< Resp>

The girls on the frontdesk were super helpful and the doctor was really friendly. They have COVID precautions, they make you fill in the forms outside and then when you're ready they will measure your temperature and give you gel before coming inside.
There were only 2 patients besides me inside the office, so that's good for promoting social distancing.
They have a good variety of frames so you can spend a lot of time there trying to choose one.
They speak Spanish, so that's a plus.<//text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808f86f4bde97c5f:0x208ca9041b28e174< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I have been going to Fruitvale Optometry since 2013, I am not fond of the lady Dr that I saw once when Dr Irani was off. She was not personable nor did she really say anything to me after my exam. This year 2020 when I went, there is a new male staff that seemed a bit impatient and unsure of what he was doing. Other than these two unpleasant experiences in 7 years everyone else especially Omar and the young lady that rings you up (I forgot her name) are excellent. I would recommend Fruitvale Optometry hands down🤓😎</Review>

This is my first time there. They were all so polite and courteous and answered my every question. Upon entering they do temperature checks and give you sanitizer. They dont rush you to chose a frame for your glasses. Due to covid they only allow 3-4 people in at a time. I thought it would take a long time but no it actually went very quick. It has been by far the best optometry i have been to in years.< /Text>

Really like going to this office whenever i need an eye exam! With COVID going on you have to line up outside, 2 people at a time, everyone has mask on and lots of sanitizer around . They are always friendly and very efficient.The area is so convenient for me right next to Fruitvale bart.They call and text with any info including appointments, yearly exam info etc.<//text>

I lost my glasses and called them to get a replacement.  They told me it may be 4-6 weeks.  When I explained that i had no other alternative, they were able to get them to me in a week.  Always exceptional customer service here.</Text>

A small, but very professional office.  I like how they cater to the Fruitvale community and treat everyone with the same degree of professionalism.  Highly recommend them.<//text>

Great experience here! I didn't have to wait too long to go back into the exam room, and then I was able to pick out some new glasses. They only took a week to come in!!!<//text>

<Review>Undoubtedly one of the best places to get your glasses and I've been with them since 5th grade (I'm now a college student). Despite it's small size and staff, they really care about you and you tell by hearing it through conversation. Couldnt recommend a better place to go. 5/5<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Eye exam was fast and reliable!! Wonderful experience with staff and doctor....They work with you if your not able to pay right away they allow you to make small payments each week until paid in full...
...Don't get me started on there wide celebrity collections they have as well as sunglasses, designer men and women glasses  and the great kid selections...🔥💕💕 Check them out asap ...ohhh and the most important is that you get your glasses really quick....we went as a family and received all our glasses within few days....yes that  fast and beyond pleased at how beautiful they came out...Thanksssss Fruitvale Optometry TM 2019< /text>< Pictures>

I like the fact that I am able to direct my 23 disabled son to the office and I don't have to be there with him and if they have any questions, my son can call me and put me on the phone with them and they will ask their question(s).</review>

<Review>Dr Irani continually demonstrates state of the art technique coupled with an engaging unhurried manner... always takes time to answer questions and concerns in a manner that is easily understandable. He is quite clearly the best optometrist I've ever been to and I have been to a number of them over the years. In addition, staff is terrific... a real pleasure to deal with. This is your place. Don't go anywhere else.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>I visited this Optometrist🌁 on 01/04/18📆
The lady who did my eye exam was very nice and patient! I forgot the woman name that helped me pick out my eyeglasses, That was my first visit there!
She was very nice and helpful also she told me about
The great deals they have👌
BUT THAT DAMN ASSISTANT. THE ONE THAT
ANSWERS THE PHONE AND MAKE THE APPOINTMENTS
HA! SHE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I GAVE THEM FOUR 🌟 🌟 🌟</text>< Time>

<Review>Very helpful, very thorough Doctor and staff. I have a somewhat complicated contact lens prescription, needing to balance near vision and far vision. The Doctor made a recommendation to try a different brand of lens and I left the office seeing much better.< /Review>< username>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>This place is fantastic for lots of reasons, and let me tell you why -- at least from my experience.

I work in Rockridge in Oakland and was referred to Rockridge Optometry, where I made an appointment. The charge for the eye exam was going to be $235 out-of-pocket, since I don't need regular eye care and hence don't have insurance for eye care.

After making the appointment, I went online and started searching the best optometrists in Oakland and saw that Fruitvale Optometry was showing up at the top. And Rockridge Optometry -- while up there -- had a number of negative reviews.

So, I phoned Fruitvale Optometry -- who were very friendly and helpful at the start. I found out that the charge for an eye exam was $90.

WOW. That's NEARLY ONE THIRD OF THE COST of Rockridge Optometry -- where there were mixed reviews! And people seemed to love Fruitvale Optometry.

Given the positive review at Fruitvale, I decided to make an appointment there.

From the minute I walked in the door late (because I had some difficulty finding them) they were totally accommodating. The staff was extremely warm and friendly.

Omar did my initial tests and rated my old glasses. He was warm and professional, as you would expect in an appointment like this.

Dr. Luu did my exam. Again, warm and professional is how I'd describe our interaction. I'd also describe her as very smart and intelligent. I had lots of questions, as someone who hasn't done a lot of eye exams. She was extremely patient and took the time to enlighten me. She also identified for the first time that my left and right eyes were different. My previous glass prescriptions hadn't recognized that.

After the exam, Omar spent a lot of time with me recommending different eyeglass frames that would work for me, even though I told him I wasn't sure I was -- and at that point, I wasn't -- ready to order frames.

These folks are awesome. My hope is that more people from Oakland will find their way into Fruitvale to discover what I think is an incredible optometry group.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

The best optometry in town! Dr. Payam Z. Irani and his team are extremely helpful and kind. I am so grateful to have been coming here to purchase my glasses and contacts since 2006! The team always helps me choose frames that fit my face and personality. I am so thankful for their services and I am confident to say that my questions regarding my eyes and prescription are always answered before I leave the office.<//text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rate>5</Rate><Text>My visit on June 16, 2017 was the same level of treatment I had in 2009. I recently came back to Dr. Payam Z. Irani a couple of months ago. My insurance was Anthem Blue Cross, which caused me to leave, and now I am with Alameda Alliance.

I saw his name as a provider for Alameda Alliance I was so happy. My first thought was, " he was so smart, he found things that other Optometrist have missed. I just remember his level of knowledge and how he explained to what was going on with my eyes.

I also want to add, his prices for glasses are more affordable than Walmart. I priced progressive with transition lenses $310.00 that was with me having my own frames. His price was around $30.00 to $40.00 less. It may not seem like a lot but I am on a fixed income so it was very reasonable and affordable.

What is also different you have friendly staff the atmosphere is so much better than other places I have been In and around East Oakland. His office carries various brands and designers of glasses to choose from.

The location is public transportation friendly, his office is directly in the Fruitvale Plaza 10 steps away from Fruitvale Bart Station and Fruitvale AC transit transfer point to other buses.

The down side is, the parking if you drive, it's on street parking, "but who needs to drive when you can Bart or Bus to his office. His location is near a lot of places you can sit and eat or if you just want to sit and have a cup of coffee. Certain days their is a Farmers Market in the Plaza. Excellent location.

I am just happy Dr. Irani is still there after 14 years at this location. I can't express how much anyone would benefit to go to a Optometrist that can explain so you understand, how to care for your eyes and get a pair of glasses that are reasonable and affordable, I am sure he takes other insurances than mentioned above..I Highly Recommend Fruitvale Optometry.< /Text><Date>1498763452804<//Date>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) They charged my insurance a fortune, I paid 325 dollars and I still, and apart my glasses the day they gave them to me, the same employee saw that they came with a crack in the right glass, I had to leave them, and it took a week and a half to give them to me again. Now they gave them to me, and against the light I realized that the glasses come with some letters that say "poly glass" or something, that was because my right eye, the same glass that had brought a crack, I felt like if something hinders me, but only when there is light, then I checked them and against the light could I discover those letters which are causing me to burn in my eye. Simply business junk.

OWNER RESPONSE:
I appreciate the response and clarification about the print on my lenses. It should be clarified that the aforementioned was never ill-intentioned, in truth, in previous times even paying for two people, I would never have paid such a high total amount, the maximum I could pay was half of that amount, and I am talking about my wife and I.
But making that clear, I also have to mention that I never in my previous lenses and seen that print, at least that it vanishes over time (I hope so). and of course I will not be able to make another appointment, since I do not have much time to do it, so I hoped that at the time I could do it, it would be done well and not have to be struggling.
But in what there is no justification, it is in the detail of giving me some glasses, at the first time with a crash in the glass, and then it takes almost two more weeks to give them back to me (bone in total almost 3 weeks to be able to use my glasses), that's very unprofessional, especially for the amount they charged. I do not say that the staff in the store has not been friendly, but since the "laboratory" is part of the business, my opinion had to go partial.
Thank you very much for your response and clarification. Good day.

(Original)
Le cobraron una fortuna a mi aseguranza, pagué 325 dolares yo todavia, y aparte mis lentes el dia que me los dieron, la misma empleada vio que venian con un crack en el vidrio derecho, los tuve que dejar, y tardaron una semana y media para volvermelos a dar. Ahora me los dieron, y contra la luz me di cuenta de que los vidrios vienen con unas letras que dicen "poly glass" o algo asi, eso fue por que mi ojo derecho, el mismo vidrio que habia traido un crack, lo sentia como si algo me estorbara, pero solo cuando ahi luz, entonces los revise y contra la luz pude descubrir esas letras las cuales me estan causando ardor en mi ojo. Simplemente basura de negocio.

RESPUESTA AL PROPIETARIO:
Agradesco la respuesta y la aclaracion hacerca del estampado en mis lentes. Cabe aclarar que lo mencionado nunca fue mal intencionado, en verdad, en anteriores veces aun pagando lo de dos personas, jamas hubiera pagado un monto total tan elevado, lo maximo que llegue a pagar fue la mitad de toda esa cantidad, y estoy hablando de mi esposa y yo.
Pero dejando ya claro eso, tambien tengo que mencionar de que jamas en mis lentes anteriores e visto ese estampado, almenos de que se desvanesca con el tiempo (eso espero). y claro que no voy a poder hacer otra cita, ya que no gozo de mucho tiempo para hacerlo, por eso esperaba que en el momento que pude hacerlo se hiciera bien y no tener que estar batallando.
Pero en lo que no ahi justificacion, es en el detalle de darme unos lentes, en la primera vez con una estrelladura en el vidrio, y despues tardar casi dos semanas mas para volvermelos a entregar (osea en total casi 3 semanas para poder yo usar mis lentes), eso es muy poco profesional, sobre todo por el monto que cobraron. No digo que el personal en la tienda no haya sido amable, pero dado que el "laboratorio" es parte del negocio, mi opinion tuvo que ir parcial.
Muchas gracias por su respuesta y aclaracion. Buen dia.< /text>

Second time taking my vehicle to this repair shop.  The first time was for an oil change.

My vehicle was due to have the timing belt, water pump, and spark plugs replaced.  I researched approximately how much this would cost and then
went to Perlu to schedule an appointment.  The gentleman at the desk greeted me as soon as I walked in.  I told him what  I wanted to have done and he gave me an estimate which to my surprise was well below what I had researched.  I scheduled an appointment for the following week.

I dropped my vehicle off a little after 8am and was told it would be ready later that day or the following which was fine.  Later that afternoon around 1:30p I received a call informing me my vehicle was ready for pick up.  I was shocked!

I will continue to take my car here for future maintenance.  Their service is impeccable and the price point is great.< /text>

The front desk Admins were nice and the gentleman took the time conversing and informing me of their services/mine needed.  Being it was my first time here (came back for a 2nd), the atmosphere is humbling and gives honor the our Serviceman/woman and Frontline First Responders.  I met with the owner who took his time to inform me of my vehicle, their testing and what I might expect in driving off.  Appreciated all the information and details with care given. They came recommended/referred and are definitely a blessing.  Thank you!< /review>

<text>Good mechanics!

The ladies at the front desk are not just friendly but also knowledgeable.👍🏻

Granted they are a busy outfit,, They need a little bit more communication on time management... but all in all good honest crew!!< /text>< pictures>

<text>I was happy with my experience with Perlu. Frontdesk told me the AC won't be done in one day but mostly likely it was fixed in the following day. AC already working and brake pads were replaced.< /text><rate>5</rate><resp>None<//resp></record>

<time>1614695255609</time><review>Perlu was recommended to me by my sis who can be prudent in matters of service. I called Perlu and noticed the person (Piña) on the other end was friendly and made me feel my business was actually important to them. That was enough to decide to bring my vehicle in and find out everyone there was friendly and that they gave great service (they immediately took care of an extra detail that popped up after). Very clean shop with a nice, big waiting area with a coffee station. Piña there is the man!<//review>< user_name>

Excellent customer service.  They gave me updates frequently on the status of my vehicle that needed extensive work to get it back on the road safely.  They treat you like family and I take all of my vehicles here.<//Review>

Took my vehicle in for AC repair. Not quite working yet, waiting on a new throttle body to ship. Purlu has been very patient and transparent about everything so far and have had excellent communication. I know this is a tricky repair (I usually do my own repairs, but I could not for the life of me diagnose the problem in my AC system). I appreciate that they are working hard on solving the problem. I will update later if they are able to get the AC running. Fingers crossed!</Review>

< Review>
My first time at Perlu yesterday. Had them check our truck to make sure it wasn't overfilled with oil changed at another place. They came right out and reassured us the truck was good. So I had them change the oil in my car and check my brakes. My brakes have plenty of wear left. My mechanic retired last year and I have been looking for a mechanic who is honest and trust worthy. Thank you for your awesome service Perlu. I will be back.<//Review>

< review>
I had a great experience with Perlu Advanced Auto Repair 6/16/20 when my car unexpectedly died at a client's home  the start of my work day.  Without hesitation Perlu coordinated with my AAA road service technician the delivery and immediate inspection of my  vechicle . Perlu staff allowed me to social distance in the air conditioned waiting area which , allowed me to continue working remotely on my laptop while repairs were done the same day . Thank you, i'll be back.< /review>

<Text>Called the shop about the situation i had with my vehicle. After coslty repairs I was waiting for a module to run and upon calling Perlu they advised me that the module didn't need to run as long as it was the only one. It was about 4 dollars more to do the smog with them but with the courtesy I was give and advise I choose to go with them and it was worth it. I had 2 kids with me and they had plenty for them to do as I waited for a smog. They where kind professional and courteous through it all.<//Text>< Rating>

<review>Perlu is great! Our starter went out and we didnt know who to take our car to for repair. AAA recommended Perlu as they are one of AAA's recommended shops. It was already 5pm and by the time I got off the phone with AAA Perlu had closed. We didnt know what we were going to do. My husband called them and they said we could park it in there parking lot overnight. Then the tow truck showed up just in time. Perlu was so nice and stayed to receive our vehicle. We felt that they cared about us.  Thank you Perlu for making our situation better and fixing our truck in a professional and timely manner. You will be the 1st one we recommend.< /review><rate>5< /rate><Response>{'time': 1580947694582, 'text': 'Thank you!'}</Response>< userid>

Nice and friendly service. Took my 2001 Dodge Ram to get fixed and repaired from an oil leak and a few other issues. Rich was very nice and explained to me what needed to be done, he even showed me on video. I am a very satisfied customer . I would also like to thank Pina for going above and beyond his call of duty to take the time to find me a place that does engine steam cleaning. Your fast and friendly service . I would recommend you to anyone. There is still honest and reliable people out there!! Thanks again:) I am one happy camper</review>

My car broke down on the freeway about 5:00pm on a Friday.  I called Perlu Advanced Automotive because I knew they were open on Saturday, a nice plus for busy workers like myself.  I explained my situation and let the owner know that I would have my vehicle towed and leave it in his parking lot to work on the next morning.  He said he would wait for my vehicle to get towed to his shop so he could lock it up in his garage.  I finally arrived at 7:30PM and the garage was open waiting for me.  We filled out paper quickly and I was on my way.  The next morning the auto shop contacted me with my fixed alternator installed and shared with me that my battery might have been the culprit.  He cared enough and didn't want to ruin my new alternator so he loaned me a battery for my vehicle since I had recently purchased my battery at another place and needed to return it.  The high level of customer service and honesty shared with made me a customer for life.  What a way to begin a new business earning your customers confidence right out of the gate.<//text>

< Review>
After months of trying to troubleshoot a P0402 code on my truck, I gave up and went to Perlu on the recommendation of another store, O'Reilys. Although I had to wait a bit it didnt really matter due to everyone being attentive. When the mechanic appeared he announced he located my problem! Part mechanical & human error. They fixed my truck with no trouble & asked that I return next day to ensure no chk eng light came back on or any hidden codes developed. They gave me a clean bill of health for my truck & sent me on my way. I wouldn't hesitate for one moment in recommending Perlu for your auto issues! Nice group of people and reasonable in price!<//Review>

I have been in RE for over 35 years, Jason is THE BEST broker I have had the pleasure to work with over the years!
He has been extremely helpful in finding suitable property for me, and my requirements are many!
Highly recommended. Save yourself possible headaches with other brokers and or agents, hire Jason.</Text>

Jason is amazing! I was looking for an apartment and Jason set up a rental search right away. I had been spending at least an hour every day looking for places, going to the same sites just to see if anything new had popped up and with the search Jason set up, I would be notified as soon as a new property went on the market which saved me a ton of time. Aside from how helpful he was and how great his services are, Jason is just a really great guy. He's really friendly, never tries to push things on you that you don't need, and extremely knowledgable about all aspects of Real Estate. I can't recommend using his services enough!<//Review>

<Review>Jason Kardos was helpful in dealing with a difficult estate sale.  His communication was prompt and complete.  I never felt like I was just “one of many” clients, but that my questions and concerns were important.   When we sell another property, we’ll definitely use Jason.<//Review>< user_id>

If I could put (-5) stars I would!
I messaged him and he didn’t reply 3 days later a messages again and he asked if he’s helped me with a certain property before I said no, and explained what I needed and he said he’s busy and to email him but he will contact me when he gets back, provided no email has not contacted me at all and then I message him again and no response it’s been a week.
He’s the only person that comes up with knowledge of pet boarding/ kennel property in San Diego so I don’t know where to go to talk to someone cause I have had a really hard time and getting 5 words from this guys is impossible.
What’s the point of post a whole article to gravitate my kind of business toward him and not help and barely say 5 words in a week?</Text>

{'time': 1621656640636, 'text': "Hi Kiley, I am sorry you are frustrated in finding a pet and boarding kennel. That is a more specialized property. Are you looking in San Diego County? I am glad I was helpful in providing you information. There are not a lot of those properties available all the time, however feel free to call or email me and we can discuss your goals and I can see if I can help you find one. Are you looking to buy or rent a kennel? Are you trying to find a property that is zoned for a kennel? Will you be paying cash or do you need a loan to purchase? Please contact me when you have time and I would be happy to discuss. Warmly, Jason Hi Kii Bee, I just tried to message you again and your email bounced back, so that is probably why you are not able to communicate.

<rating>5< /rating><review>My interaction with Jason as an out-of-state investor gave me ample opportunity to estimate his capabilities in many aspects of the real estate industry. In October 2019, I reached out to Jason to sell an investment condominium unit in San Diego. I enjoyed his efficient communication, his knowledge in the business, and his ability to resolve any issues proactively during the process. I am also satisfied with the team of people in charge of the renovation, cleaning, staging, escrow, and other services in his network. As an out-of-state investor, I was able to give Jason my complete trust and allowed him to help me with the process locally from start to finish.

The time to sell was longer than I had anticipated for this transaction, mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, I believe being able to close the deal amid all the things this year is still impressive and should be commended. Hence, without any reservation, I recommend Jason to any investors or homeowners who have interests in selling or buying real estate in the San Diego area.

I want to express my appreciation for his expertise and professionalism. I will look forward to closing more deals with Jason in the future.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< time>

<Text>Jason Kardos kept us updated on our purchase every step of the way.  He emailed us and always followed up with a personal phone call to make sure that all our questions were answered.  We had a more complicated escrow as we needed to do an exchange with our purchase and he made sure that all aspects of 3 escrows coordinated smoothly.  He was very professional and showed personal interest as well. Thank you Jason.<//Text><Rate>5</Rate>< username>

Mr Jason Kardos is by far a most capable, helpful and experienced Real Estate expert. His most virtuous asset is his "attention to detail" that he displays whenever I have contact with him for my rentals and real estate property business functions.

Thank You Jason !   This complicated deal was handled very professionally by Jason. He is an astute, trustworthy,, professional realtor which I have known since 2003 when i moved into his neighborhood. I met him while he was assisting an elderly lady moving into a smaller home. Great family and a good man. Thanks Jason< /Review>

<Review>My. Helix caught my interest as a possible neighborhood in San Diego that I might enjoy. When there was a specific house I liked, I called the realtor
listed. That was Jason Kardos, realtor of Mt. Helix Lifestyles Real Estate. Jason was immediately like-able & seemed to be agreeable & professional. He never rushed me on house tours & gave me an entire tour of Mt. Helix.

I kept his business card and phoned him to see another two properties in Mt. Helix, one in Vista & eventually one near Rancho Bernardo.
He literally drove me around 2/3 of San Diego County. I am most grateful.

Mr. Kardos also was also consistent in sending me a daily listing of suitable rental properties. He was able in a short time to understand my preferences for housing style & was very successful in choosing homes that I liked.

The most helpful contact that Jason Kardos offered was a loan officer, Ian Wright of Bay Equity LLC of Del Mar CA, who successfully found lenders to match my complicated economic situation. That valuable contact eventually allowed me to qualify for a home loan in San Diego.

Jason Kardos  also helped me find a storage solution for a large collection of antique furniture & even introduced me to an antique dealer in La Mesa in case I needed to sell anything vintage or antique.
Jason Kardos is  trustworthy & understands the real estate business. He is careful & professional with paperwork that is so important. Additionally Jason seems very available on the phone & computer and is willing to go an extra mile to be very helpful. I do recommend this real estate professional and would not hesitate to work with him again.< /Review>< resp>

As you know, land can be tough to sell sometimes depending on it price in relationship with the topography of the land, what type of zoning it has and improvements, such as utilities, grading, & building entitlements/plans. I really enjoyed sitting at the kitchen table with your parents discussing the sale since they did not have a computer or access to email. I know your Dad was so happy to get the most for the land so that your Mom could budget this unexpected money to pay off some bills and not have to worry about things on their tight budget.

The first time was for the purchase of my home, the most recent was for the sale of my condo. Both times were extremely well managed and professional.  He had excellent ideas and referrals for the improvements and fixes I needed to make to add value to the condo.  He was very hands on with all the right touches to get it ready for sale. There were multiple offers and the condo sold above what I was expecting.  He explained each step of the process very well, and walked me through the paperwork to make sure I understood what I was signing.  Escrow started right before I was scheduled to be out of the country for 3 weeks.  He made sure everything I needed to do was taken care of before I left. Escrow went very smoothly.  We closed in under 30 days. Jason is a very professional and knowledgeable realtor, as well as kind  and generous person.  I would highly recommend him for all your real estate needs.< /Text></record>

<Time>1576786131441<//Time><Rate>5</Rate><Text>Mt. Helix Lifestyles and Real Estate has been Great for me ! Jason Kardos always goes above and beyond. If I need info on a rental property, when is a good time to sell or buy, details on legal questions, a recommendation on a home improvement pro, application forms, etc... he always provides me with clear answers promptly . So when it was time to purchase a home, I felt really comfortable in using Mt. Helix Lifestyles & Jason to represent me, and I'm glad I did. The process was fast paced and he was all over it from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. moving the documents along with the seller's agent and there were things he saw during the walk through that I looked right past. He lined up a super team for the home inspection which caught things that the seller had to fix, which saved me thousands on the purchase. I will definitely  refer Mr. Kardos to my Friends & Family.< /Text>< Pictures>

I'm super happy that I trusted the sale of my last home to Jason and I will definitely be using his services again the next time I need a real estate agent!</review>< pictures>

I picked Jason as my Broker for the sale of my personal residence after knowing and working with him professionally for more than five years.

2020 presented unique marketing problems which Jason was able to address effectively and with the professional expertise I have grown to expect.  Jason was able to advise me as to important marketing alternatives as well as work with the selling agent to assure that the challenges presented the Buyers by COVID 19 were addressed.

I have no hesitation is recommending Jason to sell your home!  If you are a Buyer, Jason will use the same skill set to make sure you are happy with your purchase.

I know you have worked with many Realtors over the years at your firm and I was honored to help. It really helped to know what your goals were with your retirement and families schedules during the selling process. Your son did an amazing job remodeling your home and it was rewarding to help complete some of the projects fine details and help clean and stage your home so that it would present well in marketing pictures and showings. Listing homes through the holidays and raining weather can be challenging however once you accepted an offer you were very patient with the home inspection process and showing protocol as the COVID-19 pandemic was unveiling itself and the pending stay at home quarantine came in to effect. I hope you are able to spend more time with your family now that you have officially retired.'}< /resp>

Jason is fantastic. As a first time home buyer, I had an endless amount of questions and concerns. With Jason's knowledge of the real estate transaction process as well as his network of industry professionals, I was able to close with confidence. He referred me to financial services, provided expert recommendations regarding market trends and valuations, and took the time to answer every email and phone call. Jason is not a pushy sales type; he is more concerned with finding you a quality home that fits your budget than with closing a deal. Great service, great knowledge, great team. When you're ready to start the buying process, call Jason.</Text>

Jason helped us in the process of buying a new home. He was very helpful, detailed oriented and accommodated all of our requests. He also helped us with our rental which involved screening of potential tenants, running background checks and credit history.  It was a pleasure working with him. We strongly recommend Jason to everyone that is looking to find their dream home.</Review>

<Name>Ian Wright< /Name><Rating>5<//Rating><review>Jason Kardos is honestly one of the best Realtors around. I've always been impressed with his wide array of knowledge within every aspect of Real Estate and the local market. Many agents just push the sale of the home, but Jason is actually very skilled and knows the ins & outs of everything related to Real Estate. Whether you're buying, selling, flipping, doing renovations, residential or commercial, need advice on do-it- yourself projects or maintenance, or simply need a referral for anything property related, he's a great resource. To give you an example, he actually offered to help cut down a tree at my house which was such a stress reliever for me, yet no big deal to him. He's also just a very nice guy and fun to talk with, while really knowing his stuff at the same time. I really trust his opinion because he's so actively involved in the business day to day (which isn't the case for all realtors). For these reasons, I referred a couple of my friends to him to help them buy their first home. They were cautious buyers, but they quickly realized how genuine, honest and resourceful he was as they navigated their first home purchase. Jason and I encouraged them to get not only Pre-Approved but have their file Underwritten before finding a property which helped them win the deal in a very competitive market. Highly recommend Jason if you're looking for a great real estate resource. Thanks for what you do Jason!</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Where to begin...Let me start off by saying that Jason will never disappoint you.  He will go out of his way to do whatever it takes to get your house sold for the most amount of money in the shortest time possible.  He sold my parents' home for me but he not only sold the home, he was over there one day while I was working  and he started cutting back bushes, moving stuff around and throwing junk in the trash.  How many realtors do you know that would do that?  I have so much more I could tell you but not sure how much room I have for everything so just let me say, with all my heart, if you want the best realtor...call Jason...P.S.  and he really likes the baconator from Wendy's...:)<//Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1597028987371, 'text': 'Peggy, thank you for the kind words. It was very rewarding helping you with your parents home that you were the Trustee of. I know many people suggested that you sell the home "as-is" and not do anything to the home, however you wanted to honor your parents and had a vision of how to improve it and make it better for the next owner. I do enjoy helping clients prepare their home before listing it on the MLS and there are many things you can do that don\'t necessarily cost a lot of money like cleaning up the yard, cutting back vegetation, cleaning inside and out and painting and replacing simple things like screens, light bulbs, door handles, etc. Your home also had a cell phone tower on it that added an extra consideration in marketing and making sure the new owner was informed of easements and what type of terms conveyed with the sale. Finally I did have fun helping you stage the home with items you had and my personal staging items that I provide for free as part of my marketing plan. PS: Yes, thank you for the lunch when we were having one of our work parties at the home! :)'}</resp>

<Text>My partner and I started looking online at houses earlier this year.

We are still experiencing very low inventory for the number of buyers that want to buy a home and it is not unheard of to have as many as 10 of more multiple offers on a property. The positive is that interest rates are very low and had dipped under 3% interest depending on a buyer's credit score, amount of down payment etc. I checked my database and did not find your contacts, however feel free to message me directly and we can go over where you are at currently with loan approval. Many buyer's do not realize that they can use gift funds from a friend or family member if they do not quite have enough funds for a down-payment. If you were in the military and can qualify for a Veterans Administration loan (VA), there are 100% financing programs.  The two main other loan products would be the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan program where a buyer can qualify with putting 3.5% down of the purchase price. Then there are conventional loans which people think they have to have 20% down the purchase price although there are conventional loans that that a buyer can put down 3-5% of the purchase price. These loans have a Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) fee on them because of the low amount of down payment to protect the lender in-case a borrower defaults on their loan. The good thing to know is this PMI can drop off a loan once the property has an acceptable amount of equity for the lender. I hope this helps explain some basic loan programs that are out there. It would be best to talk to a lender about what what loan programs would be best for you. I look forward to hearing from you so that we can discuss more when you have time.

Jason Kardos did a magnificent job of marketing and selling a vacant residential lot.  Although a small transaction compared to the sale of a residence, he treated it as though it were a large transaction.  His efforts resulted in a sale that went very smoothly.  Having been a real estate agent in the past, I know how difficult these transactions can be and am impressed by how well this one was done.  Jason kept me fully informed about everything and made sure that all deadlines were met once the transaction went into escrow.  His performance exceeded my expectations and I am pleased that I selected him to be my agent.<//Text>

Jason helped my wife and I purchase our last two homes and we couldn't have asked for a more patient and knowledgeable realtor. Whether you are looking to start investing in real estate or looking to buy your first home you can't go wrong with Jason!< /review>

Jason is a one of a kind agent that truly takes the time with each and every client to learn what they need and want in their real estate transaction. I have had the honor of working with Jason for many years and am always amazed with his positive attitude and willing to help in anyway to help us get to the finish line in the closing process!< /Text>

<Time>1536425064563< /Time><rate>5< /rate><review>If you are looking for a realtor who will sell your home with complete expertise--look no further than Jason Kardos, Broker,  Mr. Helix Lifestyles.  From a referral I received from a friend who had nothing but great things to say about Jason, I chose Jason to sell my mom's house in San Diego.  From the moment I met him to our final handshake once the house was sold--in record time!!!!!--I was very pleased with the entire transaction!  Selling my mom's house--the place my brothers and I had grown up--was a very emotional experience for the three of us.   We felt very lucky to have a realtor with Jason's experience at the helm.  Selling a home is a very complicated experience.  There are many papers to fill out, many things to think about, and dozens of other details that go into the sale.  Thankfully, by using Jason as our real estate agent, the entire experience went beyond easy.  My brothers and I were very grateful for everything that Jason did to make the selling of our mother's home as easy as it could possibly be.  If you are looking for a terrific realtor--Jason Kardos fits this description perfectly.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

I love Starbucks. It doesn't matter which one you go to, they are always kind and courteous. Wait time was a little longer than usual, but they had a lot of mobile orders coming in, so were extremely busy. No worries though, I love the smell of fresh brewed coffee. :)<//review>

Starbucks is starbucks either way you look at it .. But an understaffed starbucks is hectic especially if you can't mobile order. Better have patience just saying.  P.s 25 minutes from order to getting my 3 drinks.   And FYI the guy  said sir there are other drinks in front of yours. So I told him you are giving drinks to people who ordered after me  and 3 minutes later my 3rd drink arrived.< /Text>

Best Starbucks location in Madera by a wide margin. The staff are always friendly, drinks are made quickly and consistently, and the atmosphere is much better than the other locations. Plenty of space that's conducive to getting work done or meeting up with others. Grateful to have this location in our city.< /Review>

<Review>Most Starbucks that I visit have pretty good service, based on my experience.  The Madera branch on Howard Road is no exception.  I went in for a simple coffee so that I could do some work at one of their tables.  Since they were brewing a fresh pot at the time, the barista was kind enough to bring it out to me a few minutes later when it was ready.  Very pleasant attitudes by all of the staff there!!  I'll be certain to visit again when I'm in the area.  Keep it up, folks!< /Review><rate>5</rate>< time>

My daughter ordered a drink they made it wrong and then told her they didnt have anymore to remake her drink and didnt even give her a refund when she asked for one they said it wasnt their fault they made it wrong and ran out of product. Usually we always go here and this hasnt happened before but this isnt right for what they did.</text>

I love the service, I receive at Howard location in Madera CA. I especially like the evening crew, they know my name and my favorite drink. I feel like they are part of my family. This Starbucks is the best, that's why I go at least once a day.< /text>

Everything is good.  The prices are lower here. Sure beats other places that serve coffee nearby. (Update: The cleanliness and great service add to the experience.)< /text>

Friendly employees and had my drinks made quickly. Usually chilly in there so I take a cardigan whenever I go. The parking spot is very small and usually have to park on the street, cars get blocked alot because people usually park by a wall and block each other.</text>

There's no drive through at this Starbucks, but it is in a convenient area. Its on a very busy street so its not really quiet. There are a few tables outside and a bigger table inside for larger group meetings. Its a nice store but not my favorite in Madera.</Text>

The sinkhole that opened up in the street has not slowed down business here.

The service level is what you would expect from a Starbucks.

Do not sit facing the parking lot. The sunlight glare reflecting off of the parked cars is a real drag on the eyes.</Review>

This is a very uncomfortable location. Between the cold, the acoustics, and people popping in and out from lack of a drive-thru, I cannot tolerate being here longer than 10 minutes.</text>

There is ample room for sitting, more outlets to plug in would make it 5star,the free Wi-Fi is a big PLUS.< /text>

Always good service. I'm new to ordering via the app and had an order not go through (operater error lol).  I was sitting at the starbucks waiting for my (unordered) drink for a while and a male barista recognized that there must have been a mistake and ended up saving me so much time by having it made in the fly!  Thanks guys!< /review>
