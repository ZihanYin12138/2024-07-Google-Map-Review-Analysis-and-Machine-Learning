Sorry but the 5 star review was a free gift tactic they use. I was over charged for there oxygen service and they are low staffed and would not return after being overcharged for a service that clearly stated amount on leaflet. Or possibly just got charged for the supposed free essential oil they claim to be free after you rate them 5 stars with a positive review<//review>

<review>Absolutely love everyone here! So genuinely nice and happy to help you with whatever questions, concerns or things you want to accomplish. I’ve already made plans for 2021 to be here all the time! The “wellness cocktail” made me feel so much better instantly and I thought I was doing great before! Definitely will be back for another round of that. Next is laser lipo & the sauna!<//review>< pictures>

I found a living social CBD massage and made an appointment the same day online - My massage was with Celeste, the massage was worth triple what I paid and I tipped really well. I would definitely come back here and said my friends here it’s not like a full spa experience with A hot towel on my face and wonderful CBD oil.< /Review>

The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I went in for a routine massage, no aches or pains, just some body maintenance and it was beyond my expectations. My massage therapist was Gretchen Allen and she was amazing getting the deeper knots I may have had in my back and upper shoulders area.<//Review>

I have recently gotten on to the valuable benefit of increasing my blood oxygen by going to the Oxygen Bar at RaVive Health & Vitality to breathe in more oxygen. From my experience there I find I have increased energy and a wonderful sense of well-being and productivity!
The owner, Howard, is welcoming, enthusiastic and knowledgeable AND he has many health modalities there - massage, vitamin IV drips, shots, acupuncture, infrared sauna, etc! It is very carefully cleaned, spaced and masked for Covid protection.
It is a pleasant surrounding with comfortable chairs. He gives you your own tubing to bring each time. I bring a book, and settle in to take the oxygen in for one hour - since I learned that increasing blood oxygen is incredibly helpful to fight off any viruses as well. Stay safe!< /text>

I came in for a CBD massage with Celeste and it exceeded my expectations. I haven't had a massage in almost a year due to COVID-19 and it was such a luxury to experience the Ravive facility! Everyone in the office was kind and welcoming, overall an amazing experience!<//review>

Such a great massage!! I got the 60 min CBD. I have a sciatica issue and coming off a broken ankle so I entered the place all jacked up. My sciatica was aggregating me and all. However I left in such great spirits and my body was feeling AMAZING!!! Definitely will be back for sure!!!! Was such a overall great experience. Gretchen was my masseuse. Prior to she asked me what pressure level did I want and I told her "im not a fan of deep tissue and im not a fan of the soft barely touching." She hit it dead on and it was awesome!! She also massaged the ankle that im recovering from and that was awesome as well.....throughout the enter process she kept asking if the level she was using was okay, which I appreciated!! I definitely will make the CBD massage apart of my self care routine. The one complaint I have if I had to have one was that I didn't choose the 90min massage.....next time I'll be sure to do so!! :)<//review>

I visited the clinic and I have to say I was really uneasy the entire time I was there. The ladies at the reception desk were really nice but I kept being pitched other services by a pushy salesman. Not sure if it was the manager or doctor of the clinic. He seemed to be doing this with everyone who walked in. It was very uncomfortable.</Text>

<text>I hurt my hip flexor/quad (pulled muscle or tear) and even after two weeks of intense pain, no movement (could barely take a step!), it wasn't getting better. I went to Ravive Health & Vitality for a cryotherapy session - doubts in mind, but since the rate was better than anywhere else, I figured "why not?"... it was AMAZING! First, it's incredibly relaxing and doesn't feel shocking or uncomfortable like ice packs. Second, it's so quick and easy-about 10 minutes laying on a massage table while the friendly practitioner directed the cool air on my injury to work its magic. This was on a Wednesday afternoon, and I didn't notice a big difference until Saturday morning when I went to yoga. Didn't wince once AND could even walk (at a slow pace) without any pain! It's been a week and a half and I've gotten consistently better. The past week, I resumed my daily yoga routine, could walk to do errands and could go up/down stairs! I 100% recommend Ravive Health & Vitality - not just for their cryotherapy, but also for their many other wellness services. Great people, great prices, and great ways to "Ravive" your "health and vitality" (cheese-y pun intended). If you don't have that, then, really, what do you have?<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Awesome massages and the acupuncturist really knows his stuff! So nice to have total holistic wellness in one place. My friend is doing the Ideal Protein weight loss system and has lost a significant amount of weight. It’s cool that this clinic has SO many options for that program. The artwork in the clinic is also just really great!</Review><GmapID>0x80deaba2e3db6d2f:0x4a7835bbed3aafc</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This was my first CBD massage experience, and it certainly won’t be my last. As an optometrist, I’m constantly shifting my body from the equipment to my desk. Even though I am right handed, my left arm/hand tends to do more work because of how my equipment is arranged in my exam room. Susan, my massage therapist, could tell right away that the left side of my body was more tense and knotted up. She performed a very relaxing and thorough massage to my needs- medium pressure with primary focus on my shoulders and lower back. The CBD balm provided a cooling, tingling sensation, adding a whole new level of “good feels” throughout the massage.

I only have two complaints: I would have appreciated being given a hot towel at the end to wipe off the residue prior to putting my clothes back on, and also wish the window blinds had been completely closed as it was pretty bright in the room. Other than that, Susan did a great job with the massage and the girl at the front desk was very friendly! I already have my second massage booked with them next month.<//Text><resp>None<//resp>< name>

Hi, I tried loosing weight for 12 yrs , tried everything. But not until now I was able to loose 22 lbs in 1 month and 1 week. And I never went thru hunger on this diet. They have different flavor for every meal and different types of food. I recommend  Ravive. Staff is friendly and helpful ! Howard coaches very well.< /Text>

Customer service is a dying skill, yet the staff at Ravive Health pleasantly surprised me.  They are very knowledgeable and were very patient in explaining everything and answering  my numerous questions. Their service is amazing, and their products taste good too! I feel like family and look forward to a long relationship with them. Thank you!</review>

I learned earlier this year that I have a chronic illness that has me fighting for my life. I have been working with Howard at the Ravive Health & Vitality Clinic. They have a very strong knowledge of nutrition and holistic health remedies. Using a super food diet, B12 injection therapy, and the right supplementation… My disease has started reversing, and I am regaining and restoring myself back to a completely healthy body. I am incredibly grateful. I would strongly recommend anybody I knew to be under their care.< /text>

Had a wonderful experience ! Patreece is a complete miracle worker. Been having the worst pains in my shoulders with bad knots and she took care of that with no problem. First CBD massage and will not be the last! Already book my next appointment and I cannot wait! A must go experience. So relaxing and everyone is so friendly. Fell asleep a few times with how quiet and tranquil it was. Going to come back for events as well! Thank you Ravive!!!!!</Review>

This place is amazing! Like life changing! I had an eye opening consultation and learned so much.  The CBD massage is so wonderful and relaxing but I must say that my bi weekly b-12 shots are my favorite thing about Ravive. They pick me up and keep me feeling great and help me heal faster as I am an injury prone outdoor athlete so this is so necessary! The staff here is also amazing.  Howard is always helpful and Amanda is so great at what she does!  If you’re lucky you’ll get to meet her awesome dog! I also can’t wait for the IV treatments. It’s very cool to see a place in San Diego offering so many wonderful services and products!<//review>

I had an amazing experience at Ravive Health and Vitality! Howard and Amanda are very friendly and really knowledgeable about nutrition and Holistic therapy. They offer so many incredible services...I came in for the cryotherapy facial from Amanda and a CBD massage from Patreece. This was my first time getting both these treatments and I couldn’t be more pleased! Both ladies are very good at what they do...I left feeling refreshed and relaxed. I slept like a baby that night! I will definitely be back and highly recommend Ravive!<//Review>

I've been lucky enough to try this place out pre-grand opening and have already been really impressed. I called to see about their iLipo treatments and Amanda gave me some great information - it was clear she knew the system very well. Based on how comfortable I felt with her, I made an appointment to come in and try out a session. The office is smaller and makes you feel immediately at home - no 'clinic-y medical type environment here, and Amanda makes sure you feel comfortable and welcome.

I'm impressed with what I've seen so far and their prices are also really well placed. I can't wait to go back for a massage or some accupuncture!!<//text>

<time>1618427460391< /time><rating>5< /rating><Review>BALA IS THE BEST!! I remember last year I went to this one eyebrow place and they messed up so bad. A lot of people recommended me to go to Bala, so I did. The environment is clean, organized, and had positive energy! She immediately saw what was wrong and fixed my eyebrows, she also helped grow my eyebrows out more defined and thicker which I appreciate. I really enjoyed how she actually takes the time to get to know her customers and is very friendly.<//Review><GmapID>0x809adf66ba4798ed:0x2b97072866a6f963< /GmapID><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

Love this place ! After waxing my eye brows for YEARS I decided to try out eye brow threading. I love it! The process was so fast and looks great! She also made me feel so comfortable for my first time.< /text>

Feels like visiting your very friendly aunt to have your eyebrows taken care of. The place is clean and cool, the work makes you feel a little better about yourself somehow. My wife and I frequent this place and have 0 complaints for over a year.< /Review>

Balbir just knows how my eyebrows grow and threads them the way I want them. I've been seeing her for years since her Beauty by Thread days. I wouldn't go anywhere else! She's quick and gets the job done efficiently!</Review>

Raman put me at ease at my first visit of ever having my eyebrows threaded.   She did exactly what I asked her to do. I now have beautifully shaped and arched brows. Also very reasonably priced!  Definitely going back!< /Text>

Quiet park at this time, we brought our lunch and ate and there were people coming and going but no one bothered us or came to play on jungle gym. Just needs closer restrooms and a place to wash hands. Overall it was a great scene and the kids had a wonderful time.</review>

There is a strong smell of marijuana that comes from the apartments just east of the play structure. The parking lot had skaters and people smoking cigarettes. I did not feel unsafe, but I have felt more comfortable at almost any other park.< /Text>

This park is definitely a huge benefit to the community but it could use some improvements. Given that it is a water basin, it is still a good place for the programs being run. I like the fact that the restrooms always have the nesessary items and are reletivley clean maybe just an upgrade in the future. Great place to bring the family!</text>

<time>1504673710185< /time><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Bad overall. I placed my order for a bridesmaid dress back in February. Few months after they told my friend that it was ready, they didn't even call me that it was ready. When I went to try it on, I was disappointed to see that my dress was not right, some Willy guy that works both shops took my measurements wrong. I had to pay extra for them to "fix it" and yet I went back 3 weeks after when they said it would take 5 days and they would call me, they never did. My dress was still not ready and they did not do what they were to suppose to. The beads on my dress were coming apart. The dress still had pins on it. Very dangerous. I would think twice before going here. Messy place and bad service overall.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMTLrSA3bW6gpqhjiCK4MYVl44oDj80QnzgWOV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-uNfHUcHBII2sgJchwWmrUQk1qNQPwDXUQE0w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

<text>WORST PLACE IN THE WORLD!!!! The workers are so rude and don't care what you think and won't help in anyway. They will argue with you!! my wedding dress took forever to be done and was never ready when I went to go try it on. The manager Julio doesn't help or care about your needs. I contacted him about my dress and would only text me back when he wanted to. Also Roxana is a worker there and she is so rude and always has a mean face on. she made my experience terrible!!! This has been the worst place I ever been to. Don't go here they don't deserve people money. The environment is so uncomfortable!!!!!< /text>< pictures>

I wish, I could give negative 0 . Worst place ever!!!! They promised us a beautiful custom made dress for my niece. Not even close to the picture we gave them. Also when we set a day when everything should be done. They never keep the promise.  They give lagging on it.
They broke thier  Contract.
I'm taking to my lawyer's and it doesn't look good for them.i have a pretty nice case with them.<//Text>

<review>Worst place ever!! Straight out fraud. They told us our daughters dresses were going to be hand made therefore the price $100 a piece. They took measurements and said they would be ready in a week or so. Came back today and come to find they ORDERED their dresses both on the same size and none of them fit on them. They were too big. Now they also want to charge me for alterations to the dresses that were supposed to be hand made in the first place. Very condescending guy in charge, his name is Freddy. He was dealing with another angry customer and was being extremely rude. They do whatever they want since people come pick up their dresses a day or two before so it makes it nearly impossible to take your business elsewhere. Avoid this place at all costs and if you decide to give them a chance have them write everything down on the contract they give you. Whatever they promise and say have them write it down, sign it and get a copy from them.</review><gmap_id>0x80c2c7cc855d868f:0xf0596365cf809eb8< /gmap_id><Date>1531508568745< /Date><Response>None</Response><Rating>1</Rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user_id>

<Text>Like the others said I would give them a zero if I could. We ordered flower girl dresses 3 months in advance. They were nice at first when making the sale. We were called 3 times and told that the dresses were not ready. They keep pushing back pick up dates. Our girls have not been able to try on dresses so we don't know if they will fit and wedding is in 19 days. We really love the dresses and want to make the transaction work. However they just don't give you anything to work with. Bad Customer service. No explanation why it has taken so long to get dresses. No apologies no compassion or sincerity. Really hard to work with these people. I can honestly say they don't care. They just keep saying we will have them ready and don't. Unfortunately we paid the dresses in full and cannot get our money back.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>I wish I could give ZERO stars. Just talked to manager who treated me terribly. All they care about is making a sale. Their salesperson promised me dresses over a month ago and I haven't received them. Then the manager tells me I will have to pay $40 to get the dresses delivered to me and when I asked for a refund he refused. FRAUD. They also pressure you to pay cash so you have no choice to dispute charges. Manager is rude and doesn't care about customer. He then tells me the salesperson should not have told me they were going to mail me dresses because they don't do that and that he fired that person because of things like that. He fired her but I still don't have dresses and he did not care one bit. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PLACE!!! I have placed a complaint with BBB case # 630165 and hopefully this fraud will stop.</review><Date>1531168559884</Date>< Response>

They lied to my best friend stating they were working on her dress, did not start until 2 days before the wedding which they rushed! The dress is horrible. No compensation no alternatives. They made my bf believe they can make a wedding a dress in 4 months. Each time she called and went down there they gave her excuses why the dress was not ready...made her buy more material,  she spent more money on a dress she is not happy with! She's been crying since day 1<//text>< Pics>

<Text>I wish I could give ZERO stars. This has been the worst experience I've had. It took 3 weeks for someone to get ahold of someone to book a fitting. Then was told I was not even scheduled for the day given. After finally booking an appointment I was rescheduled for a later time which did not work for us. I paid extra for cancellation on pictures due to dress not being ready. Anyone interested PLEASE do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere.<//Text><time>1532309770869< /time><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<review>They seemed nice at first. They took measurements and ordered the dresses for my bridesmaids and the sizes still came in wrong. Apart from that it was hard as heck to get the dresses once they came in. Apparently an appointment is needed JUST to pick up the dresses which makes no sense if your not doing a fitting. My flower girl dress was paid for but I never even received it. DO NOT go here EVER. They are way disorganized and if you call to get information they put you on hold literally for 30 to 45 minutes. Horrible experience. And it's not like the prices are that great either...< /review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2c7cc855d868f:0xf0596365cf809eb8</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>This place is a fraud. DO NOT make the mistake of spending one penny there. Unprofessional ignorant staff who is trained to be nice just to get the sale then they don’t care. My mother’s Bridal dress was wrong color sleeves where horrible not the material promised! They don’t reimburse you so read their agreement if you decide to purchase here strongly don’t recommend it!

The experience we had was the worst experience for my first quinceanera first they schedule your appointment to a date then they call to cancel it since the dress was not finished it does not end there the dress had not even started to get done. When I get a call of the person of the lady that was making a dress, she send me a picture of a dress that had nothing to do with the dress my daughter had pick and to top it off when we went to pick up the dress we were missing the top of it that they never made and it was totally something different then what they said they would make. It don't end there we had two dress order for quinceñeras I ended picking mine up but my sister didn't want to end up in the same situation I did and ended up losing her deposit since it's in the stupid contract that they do t give deposit back even when they do you wrong. Do not go to this store if u want to be worried free terrible service. But of course to get your money they act really nice.</text>

Rude! Don’t buy a dress in this store. When I purchased my daughters dress they were really nice they took my daughter measurements and said they were going to have it ready when we came back a few weeks later. For $100 extra they were giving me the crown and the artificial flowers and when I asked to show me which I can choose from they told me that when I pick up the dress they will show me, when I came back to pick up the dress it wasn’t ready they wanted $100 extra to cut the length. The crown and artificial flowers were the cheapest and when I said I don’t like any of the flowers and crown and asked for my extra money they said they wouldn’t return it because I sign the contract and even threatened me and my mom with calling security. The employees especially a guy named Freddy were mocking us and got loud with us. Since our dress wasn’t ready they were going to have us come back but then Freddy said we’re going to fix the dress so you guys don’t come back it felt like they were just throwing us out with the dress after we paid $600 cash!! Like really ?? The only thing they fixed were from the shoulders that’s it! It was super long and they didn’t fix it, they were charging an extra $100. Just awful coustumer survice. Be careful!!<//Text>

They will make you pay cash so you can’t get refund and not deliver on what they promise. They said I had to pay more to get my dresses and now I see other people’s reciews say same thing. They will gauge you!! The manager is rudest person ever. Just care about making a sale. FRAUD.< /Review>

<review>WORST EXPERIENCE EVER !!
I almost left CRYING !!!
The owner, a Chinese woman did NOT respected the price they gave me and she wanted to charge me 700 dlls for a 300 dlls dress !!!!!
And at the end she did NOT wanted to sell me the dress because she said SHE WANT TO KEEP THE DRESS FOR HERSELF !!!!

WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS IS THIS !

I DONT RECOMEND THIS PLACE, SHE MADE ME CRY !!!!!

I think the way she acted was the worst, she was mean and didnt care at all about my feelings ... rude woman !!! So sad 😢

Dont spend your money here, you can find same dresses in other stores for cheaper price !!!!!

Tuve una experiencia HORRIBLE ! casi salgo llorando de la tienda, vino la dueña que es una pinche china y el vestido que me medi que estaba cochino, y era de muestra lo subio de 300 dlls a 700dll!
Le dije qe me lo dejara en 500 y dijo que no que ya no lo quiere vender que lo queria para ella!!!!
Que tipo de negocio es este!!!!
No gasten su dinero con esa pinche china culera !!!!!!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><username>Jacqueline Picazo</username>< rate>

I got my daugther's Quinceañera package and they  thy took forever to bring it (I finish paying in December and we got it until june). The package was supposed to be engraved with her name and date. They took another month to give me the rest of the package and when we finally went to pick it up it didn't have the name, I told them that I was told it would have her name and they stated that since it was not in the contract that there was nothing to be done. Also they didn't have the bouquet ready so we had to wait. The experience was horrible but at least I was able to get the dress. I had to pay extra 100 at another place to have the stuff engraved. NOTE that Freddy guy just plays with customers patience and is very irresponsible. Please don't buy here<//Text>

They don't deliver what they promise. Ordered dresses for our church anniversary ang never got the dress on time. The dresses were not the same size as what we asked them. They even took measurements but the dress are still not the right size. Very bad customer service. DO NOT EVER ORDER FROM THIS STORE. By the way, they changed there name to "Roxette Boutique" they are still the same people.

Very poor review 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼</review>

Really, really bad and  rude service.. I bought my daughter's quinceañera few months ago and they had to make 3 different dresses because it wasn't the same dress we purchased. I asked how come they're selling something and giving something totally different, and the answer was... "oh la persona que ase los vestidos se equivoco," and of course my question was " did the lady make the same mistake 3 times????????.. by the way I gave 1 star because you have no choice of "0".<//Text>

< Review>
DO NOT BUY ANYTHING IMPORTANT HERE!!!!!!!  I ordered my daughter's quinceanera dress here june 12th, 2017, 9 months before her Quinceanera! They assured me It would be in in 3 months (by September). September comes around and my daughter is constantly asking for me to check on it. She is excited of course to get her dress fitted and move forward with photoshoot and invitations (she wanted a picture of her in dress sent out with invites). I call and call and am told to call back 5 times  in two weeks I am told this. Mind you, I work and have four other kids who have needs and wants, therefore it gets frustrating to call a place every little chance you get with no actual results or answer to your questions. Finally on the sixth call I am told that the dress with be shipping JANUARY 7TH!!! I thought I heard wrong but no that is what they said! I felt my heart boil and my stomach turn...I can only imagine how my poor daughter was going to feel when I break the news.
The worst thing about it though was these people have no sympathy for their customers. It was like no big deal that the dress would be arriving 1 month before her event. The person I spoke to PERLA even hung up on me. According to her I was yelling at her. I kept asking to speak to a manager or someone in charge and she would tell me she was in charge and whoever I would speak to would give me the same information therefore there was no use in even speaking to anyone else. I was an am so upset and regret not looking up their ratings before purchasing in full this dress. That another they bribe into paying in full. At this point i wish I would have simply gave a small deposit and lost it. Now I'm stuck. I don't know what to do. Anyway, please stay away from this place.<//Review>

The worst place I have ever been too, my mother had bought a wedding dress and then they butchered it. After having one week to have the alteration done the cut was uneven, the lady who took care of us was very rude and unprofessional. Worst experience, I am coming from chicago expecting to have a good experience with the Los Angeles fashion district, it turned out to exactly was said in Chicago. Dirty, unprofessional, full of criminals like this store, and extremely rude. If anyone is thinking of getting anything from this place, just turn around and go to another place. Disgusting attitudes.<//text>

I agree with everyone else, worse place ever very rude, I ordered my two daughters Quinceañera dresses 8 months before the event, and I had to call them to make the appt. to go try them on, they needed alterations so I went back to pick them up and they hadn't fix them or iron them so I went back a wk later and finally I got them right and all of them are very rude 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻</review>

(Translated by Google) To all those people who want to buy here, I do not recommend my wife and sister went to buy dresses here, and the truth is they all left them wrong, the glitters peeled off, the fabric torn without knowing, dresses of poor size and the gay who works he doesn't know his job here ..... so avoid bad taste and look for a better place .......

(Translated by Google) I wouldn't give him any, star. But if you did not let me give your opinion, I went to this store from March 5, 2016 because my daughter was celebrating her long-awaited "15" years. On 7/1/17 - July 1 and it was a reasonable time to have everything ready TRUE. AND BELIEVE ME THAT THE DATE IS NOT GIVEN MY PACKAGE ..
WITH THAT I TELL YOU A LOT. BEWARE OF THIS STORE.
I SUFFERED AN ESTRON. BRAIN PARALICISES. AND NOW I HAVE AN ANURISM A BLOOD CLOT IN MY HEART. AS A RESULT OF THIS ANGER. AND MY DAUGHTER SUFFERED A LOT FOR ALL OF THIS. AND THE EXPENSES ARE NOT SAID.
We do not recommend this place.

Yo no le daría ninguna, estrella. Pero si no no me dejaba opinar yo fui a esta tienda desde 5 de Marzo del 2016  pues mi hija cumplía sus tan anelados "15"años .el 7/1/17 - 1 de julio y pues fue un tiempo razonable para tenerlo todo listo cierto.y CREANME QUE ASTA LA FECHA NO ME AN DADO MI PAQUETE..
CON ESO LES DIGO MUCHO .CUIDADO CON ESTA TIENDA.
YO SUFRI UN ESTRON. PARALICIS CEREBRAL. Y AHORA TENGO UN ANURISMO  UN COÁGULO SANGUÍNEO EN MI CORAZÓN. A CONSECUENCIA DE ESTE ENOJO .Y MI HIJA SUFRIO MUCHO POR TODO ESTO .Y LOS GASTOS NO SE DIGA.
No recomendable este lugar.</Text>

Love this neighborhood hike. We've been doing it with my husband for years. I've even taken my mom when she comes to visit. You can take it easy and only do the trailes or you can go up all the stairs and then come down through the trails. This last one is my favourite way to so it.</Text>

< Review>
This place was really fun. It was a short and sweet easy hike. The only part that was more strenuous was the stairs. You don’t have to take the stairs though, you can hike up the side roads made for just pedestrian traffic. I can see there are a lot of people who go here and have group workouts which seems really cool. Loved it and the views were nice at the top. Also, there were a ton of juice and food trucks at the entrance so that was nice to see a refreshing end to our hike.<//Review>

I love the Scenic Oberlook at Baldwin Hills. The stairs are a minster. They are very high step.i didn't go to the top today but have in the past. The park suppose to close at 6pm however people are out there late at night walking up those steps in pitch dark. Most use cell phone lights. So when you go up you must come down. Its not that easy especially if you have bad knees, so beware.</review>

<userid>104326562839335101890</userid><Name>Marilyn Monday</Name><Time>1609822938443< /Time><rating>5<//rating><text>You can do this hike in an hour (the long, gradual trail), OR you can go for the 282 uneven stone stairs and hit the top and back in 20 minutes. It's almost harder coming down, though, because by then your legs are tired and if it's cold out, mine cramp up so I feel like I might just buckle and tumble! There are several open landings where you can step aside and catch your breath.

Apparently the record for someone getting up the fastest was only 2 minutes, but Jesus f, that seems insane to me!!

There's a public restroom that's open at the top, but the visitors center is closed for now. Pretty crowded, there's really no avoiding people on the stairs, but most people were wearing masks when we went today - mine was damp by the end, though, because it's a real workout.
There seem to be a lot of kids who stand in the middle of pathways, and seem to be unaware that the stairs are difficult at all,  haha! If you're very worried about social distancing and masks, be aware that kids are being some real kids out there and will bump into you and not notice they're huffing and puffing right at you... You've gotta run your defense and just avoid getting close to 'em.

TOTALLY worth a stop!! We even found a meter that someone had paid ahead, still had 2.5 hours left on it when we left! A nice quick thing to conquer just to say ya did it.<//text>< Pics>

Don’t come here unless you are really fit or you won’t make it up the stairs.  It’s hard!! Also very crowded so people all breathing hard and narrow stairway.  Also the steps are huge and stepping down can be very hard on the knees. Do not recommend this place</Review>

Update...Be very careful if you are going here. There are a TON of people working out without masks or abiding to any kind of social distancing. I have a friend who got the rona shortly after working out here. Scary.

Old review:
Incredible view from the ocean to pass downtown! Not an easy climb however. Bring water. There's also a water fountain (& bathroom) at the top of you can make it there...Have fun!</text>

<review>Nice little park for the kids. It has a small workout area for adults.

Only downside is that sometimes a bum or two will hog the bathroom to take a bird bath, so accompany your kids to the restroom 🚻.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>One if the nicer playgrounds. It looks fairly new and clean with climbing structures, a train to climb into, swings, a small sand pit, shaded picnic tables, a small stage with seats for audience and public restrooms.

Downsides are limited parking and noisy street<//review>< user>

Local residents need to have more pride in upkeep. Parents need to watch their kids. I see some families with no regard for keeping the park.  Typical of those in the Eastside area. : No pride in home ownership, or community: But have no problem abusing local restaurants.< /text>

<Text>Beautiful park with a garden in the back. My daughter loved the train design for the toddler playground and the kid playground had a rock climbing theme. There was a little exercise workout area for adults. Only bad thing was the restroom. No toilet paper no toliet seat covers and no soap<//Text><Date>1548365780764<//Date>< username>

Beautiful and breathtaking scenery here at the trailhead. The only way to really get idea of the beauty is to be there firsthand and make that trip I can't explain words how nice it is out there. We really enjoyed the ride stopped and ate some local food and take lots of pics. Soon as we get a chance we'll be headed back up north to visit again until next time!</text>

Water fountains (including doggy fountain) at the trailhead. Dog bags too. About halfway through the 2- mile loop there's a trail that branches off to the right (if traveling counterclockwise) and crosses Chino Hills Parkway into more hilly trails, the main one leading all the way to Grand Avenue Park.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Good, quick hike in an easy loop. Lots of hills for a bit of a light challenge, too. Not at all a scenic trail, but it offers some solid exercise for sure.<//Review>

Would have gave 5 stars but it was a little too hot for my liking, might want to save this hike for winter.</Review>

Nice views and workout! Saw a baby rattlesnake on middle of trail, literally snuck up on us taking sun. Keep your eyes peeled and stay safe! Lucky it was a baby.< /Text>

Really gorgeous hiking area where you can listen to the wildlife and birds. It's very green and not too crowded oh, the loop is relatively easy and it's a great way to relax and unwind in the suburbs< /Review>

Clearly marked trail with markers every quarter of a mile. Also dog friendly. If you want a bit of a challenge go left at the starting point. There's a bit of a steep hill in the middle of the trail you'll go up if you start in reverse.<//review>< time>

Great trail.  Very difficult for me.  So many steep hills but well pathed. Gorgeous homes around the area make it nice as well.<//Review>

Great trail 2.25 miles of steep and moderate hills.  Secluded enough to not be over crowded but still close to freeway access.  Fantastic morning hike/run.<//Text>

I love 2.1+ miles hike, but you do get a nice work out going up hill whatever way you walk, so take your time. But if you walk it everyday you tend to get bored. Just make sure you stretch a bit as your hamstrings get tired & sore after going up hill, especially after walking around loop 2 or more times. Bring your water.</text>

2nd time they get my order here now!!
I asked for avocado and was given none! Almost no rice at all".
It seems like they just threw left overs on the plate because they were about to close within 30 mins.

I literally live 3 mins away! I love Waba Grill but I don't know if I'll be going back.

Management this is ridiculous!!< /text>

The two guys that served us didn’t care. The guy making the food would leave to the back for like 5 mins and would come back and make one bowl at a time and then leave again. They took 25 minutes to make 2 bowls and people got their order before us. Waba grill is good but the workers here suck.</review>

I like to give people a chance and just say hey maybe they were having a bad day but by the looks of the reviews around the customer service they really do not seem to know what good customer service is. There was only 1 lady working at the register and cooking plus she did not want anyone eating eating in did not even ask you if you're dining in or out lol. She seemed miserable and I hope she is not the owner. Hope they turn it around...< /review>

<Text>Fantastic place to get something quick to eat.The chicken and rice bowl is the best! I'd say it's better than Panda and other Asian inspired "fast food" establishments because it's not greasy at all. The location is very clean and nicely set up. Food is fantastic and on the healthier side. Prices are also very reasonable and affordable.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
So sad in this day and age of Restaurants Galore that Waba Grill has become the latest price gouger out there. Is Gouger even a word? Perhaps Not.  Walked in here tonight with the intention of getting my Grub on... sadly it would Not happen. Waited a couple of minutes for the girl to come to the register. Noticed prices went up (not terribly, just a few cents here and there).  Went to order my staple, The Waba Signature Plate.  Was told, quite rudely, that I would have to pay Extra since I didn't want Rice. Sure, penalize me for wanting to be healthy. No More Waba for me!! I'm done with them. So sad cause I really liked their food. However, with an extra charge for being healthy  and a side of attitude, No Thank you.  Judging by the crowd in there.  2 people, they Probably could've used my order of 8 Plates!  Hungry family at home will Now be disappointed.  However with 10 Gazillion places to eat out there, I'm sure I'll find a substitute.

Waba Grill's Motto:

At WaBa Grill we are committed to providing our customers an enjoyable dining experience, serving the finest quality meals.

Our foundation is based on healthy eating with low calorie, low carb and high protein options.

We are the place for healthy food options on-the-go.

Lesson 1) Don't have an attitude with your customer.
Lesson 2) Don't boast "Eating Smart and Being Healthy"  then penalize a customer for wanting to do Just That.
Lesson 3) There are MANY places that offer Healthy Food Options on-the-go!

Funny just a month ago I was in here and I ordered my standard, which incidentally included No Rice, and the gal not only made my food to order, she actually gave me avocado at NO Charge. Funny how a New Year and Perhaps new ownership changes things???< /review>

<text>My food was cold. The rice was hard and old. The 3 employees that were there were young. They act like they didn't know what they were doing. I wasn't happy. Also it didn't smell like Waba. It smelled like urine. The BEST Waba Grill is in Chatsworth, Ca. Y'all need lessons from them. They are very welcoming, happy and speak to you when you come in... I didn't get that from this one on Soledad Canyon Rd. If I can give them a zero I would. In my book they don't deserve a one</text>< Pics>

Horrible!!! I was over charged for almost everything (4 meals). Manager said "corporate changed the prices a few days ago"  but they didn't change the prices on their menu to match. Three other people were there complaining about being over charged while we were there too. Manager was extremely rude. To make things worse my daughter and I both had bad stomach aches not long after we left!< /review>

The lady at the register, who was the owner is so RUDE! I gave her a coupon for buy 2 drinks and a waba bowl and get a waba bowl free.  A tiny section of the coupon was ripped where it said two drinks and she would not honor the coupon!!! So I had to get the other part of the coupon to show her what it said bc she wouldn't take my word for it... She still refused even when I showed her the piece that was missing! I told her that she had bad customer service and that she is losing a customer! Lady if your gonna own a business you need to take a class in CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! But it makes sense now, why I never see anyone in this place...and she's the one to blame<//text>

Emily was my nail tech she was very Meticulous And precise in her skill. she had a couple of hiccups but quickly corrected them. I was very pleased with her performance and she was patient with me being that I was a new customer. I would recommend her and definitely go back even though I live in West Hollywood/Beverly hills/Fairfax district.< /review>

My nails got so messed up she didn’t do what I wanted doesn’t understand anything I’m saying she said she’ll fix for me I paid more then I expected to pay for extra even though it was her fault and not even a few days later 3 of the cheap nails she put on fell off!!!! Unbelievable what a waste of money! Never again will I ever go there.or recommend anybody to go there!!!!<//Review>< pics>

I moved here 2 years ago and have visited several salons in the area. I think Pretty Nail Studio is now my salon of choice.  I have been helped by several estheticians there over the last year. Today I had Tina and I really liked the way she did my pedicure. I think I will make an appointment with her again next time! They have a lot of estheticians at this salon so there is almost never a long wait. The place is clean and it'a close to home. I have brought my daughter here too!< /Text>

I only come to get pedicures. I really love the detail treatment of the option #3 pedicure for $30 (😱), I like to get regular polish, but I am always so unhappy about the polish being capped, which is fine for gel polish. So I always get this uneven line across the top of my toe nails. Pricing is a bit high, but again I really love the detailed cuticle work.<//Review>

I came in for an acrylic nail fill and I think they did a really great job. The inside is not as nice as the photos but the work is pretty good. Prices are fair.< /review>

< Review>
ALTER DIRTY JOB, GOT AN INFECTION!!
On June 9 my sister and I went to PRETTY NAIL STUDIO located on Peak. I always get my gel manicure there, and never had a problem. So I decided to get a pedicure on that day, unfortunately the fallowing day I stared to feel pain on my big toe. Turns out I have this NASTY INFECTION, IT IS THE WORST EXCRUCIATING PAIN EVER!! I went to see my doctor, he said this happens a lot when technicians don't clean their tools correctly, hopefully it heals otherwise MY DOCTOR MIGHT HAVE TO REMOVE MY WHOLE NAIL AND DO AN INCISION!!

PLEASE SO BE AWARE WHERE YOU GET YOUR NAILS DONE!  DO NOT GO THERE!!😡😡😡😡😡😡😡<//Review>

Worse place ever! Holly needs to have better customer svc! All other employees at pretty nails are great! But holly is very unprofessional she doesn't care about her customers! Bad advertisement she wanted me to get fills on a 1 month old set mind u I got fungus bcuz of "pretty nails" n she did not want to do a new set bcuz she wanted to leave early I ARRIVED AT 6:18 pm n closing time was 7:30 pm if she could not do my nails she should've never said she could take me! It was 6:55pm when she decides to leave n mind u their was 5 employees n 3 customers incluiding myself! WOW N I ALWAYS USE TO GO THERE N SPEND MY MONEY WHICH I DONT MIND SPENDING FOR GOOD SERVICE TIP INCLUDED! Holly u lost quite a bit of customers  bcuz u wanted to leave early n not do what I wanted n was paying for HEALTH DEPT WILL BE VISITING U PRETTY SOON 😊<//text>

My girls have been receiving lessons from him for well over a year now and he truly is amazing. He makes it fun and enjoyable for them, he is incredible with children and is very creative in the ways he interacts with them. Above all, he is extremely patient and the smile on his face when your child stands up on a wave is priceless. I love how he also teaches about ocean safety, all the interesting sea creatures and sea life they get to see and experience as well as keeping our ocean clean. My daughters are always wanting to pick up garbage in the water modeling after Houtan, as he is always coming back in with garbage he has retrieved from the water in an effort to keep our ocean clean.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>My boyfriend and I just had our first lesson with Houton out of their Laguna Beach location and he was amazing!! Houton was laid back but very concerned for our safety and wanted to ensure we had a great time as well. I felt comfortable in the water even though I was extremely nervous at first. Houton even took pictures and videos for us for no charge. Excellent surf instructor. Thanks again, Houton and Cali Surf School!</Review><userid>109854045299997985043< /userid>< Rating>

Incredible surfing experience with our instructor Alex. The wetsuit and boards were provided, and our instructor took the time to teach and explain safety, proper techniques, and helped each person in our group individually with what we needed. I 1000% recommend Alex & Cali Surf School, everyone in our group had such a fun time!<//review>

Houtan was an incredible teacher and SO so kind!! I took my husband and parents, and while we’d had surfing lessons before, we’d never learned the tips and tricks he taught us and we all got up and properly surfed during our 90 minute lesson! He was incredibly helpful with all facets of learning surfing and knows tons about the area and gave us great recommendations on other water activities in the area. If you book a lesson with anyone, book it with Houtan!</text>

We had family in town for spring break and I cannot sing Houton’s praises enough. We had 3 adults and 4 kids (5,7,10,15 and up to 40) and literally all of us had the best time. He is so patient, thorough and just super dope in general we will definitely be coming back to see him. If you book with them definitely request Houton!  🤙🏼<//Review>

This was my first time surfing and Houtan was the best instructor I could ask for! The water can be a very intimidating place - making it hard to learn a new skills. But Houtan was very chill and laid back. He provided very useful information that will guide me whenever I am in bodies of water and surfing. He was on time, communicated information clearly and concisely, and made sure you caught as many waves as possible! He focused a lot on safety and he celebrated our achievements, no matter if they were big or small. When you made a mistake, he corrected you and always explained information multiple times. I was able to catch a few waves on my first time and I had SO much fun! I will definitely come back and I would recommend them to anyone wanted to learn how to surf and even more experienced surfers. No matter young or old, Houtan is the instructor for you! Thank you Cali Surf School for this experience 🤙🏾<//text>

<Text>Houtan was such a wonderful mentor and guide for my two sons on their first surf experience!  He taught them about the ocean, about the tides, and of course about surfing. Highly recommend and I look forward to their next lesson!< /Text>< user_id>

Houtan was a very knowledgeable and super fun instructor. I’ve taken a surfing lesson before (which was a long time ago) but I feel like I’ve learned a lot more from him. I would totally take a lesson with him again. Thank you Houtan!< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Houtan was amazing! Me and my boyfriend had our very first surf lesson over Valentine's weekend and it was everything we expected and more. Houtan was really attentive to fixing our form so we can improve little by little. He also taught the importance of watching for specific signs for when it's safe to surf. We will definitely be taking more lessons in the future!</review>< Pictures>

My 17 year old twins both chose this as their favorite part of a 9 day trip full of activities and adventures. After receiving their instructions, both kids easily got up on their boards and were actually able to surf! I can not recommend Cali Surf School high enough! Excellent experience!<//Review>< pics>

Houton was amazing! He came in with a fun and knowledgeable, experienced, and gives great instructions. Patient making you feel very comfortable with the waves. It was my first time surfing 🏄‍♀️ and with his instructions I was able to stand on the board from the first class. Will be taking more classes. Thank you Houton and Cali Surf School for hiring great professionals. Definitely recommend!<//Text>

Houtan was the man. Very knowledgeable and he was super safe with my 4 and 7 year old. They both got up so many times on the board that it really was amazing. Very happy we did this as a family and couldn’t have asked for a better experience with Houtan.< /Text>

Wow! This was such a positive experience. I was skeptical at first, especially since I never surfed before and had no idea what I was getting myself into. Our instructor Houtan was the kindest and sweetest dude. He was super professional and made sure to fill us in not only with technical advice but also with all the knowledge around the ocean, the tides, the times etc. It was extremely informative and all in all so.much.fun. Highly recommend !<//review>

My wife and I brought our son to SoCal for his birthday for two sessions of surfing lessons. All of us were first timers. Houtan was amazing. He had beginner surf boards ready for us in addition to wet suits, a must in November. He planned for success and had us come to a great location and tide for nubes. He was so patient and positive. All of us got up over and over! Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect. But it was so fun. We'll definitely be back for more. To top it all, he had a go pro and took pictures and videos. All unexpected and free of charge. Huge bonus!< /review>

<Text>Had such a great time with Cali Surf School; was taught by Peedram! He was very patient and understanding yet firm when he needed to be with helping provide the confidence to stand up. My friend came with me and is not big of swimming or water activities, but he even got her to get out in the water and practice feeling comfortable with the ocean under the board.

Currently working on my surfing with Alex and after two sessions I can see lots of improvement. On your first class he goes through the basics with you for a better understanding and practices/corrects your pop-up. He is so much fun which makes the whole experience very enjoyable and makes sure you feel comfortable and safe for the duration of the class. Definitely recommend them! Gracias Alex!< /Review>

With some safety instruction first and some instructions on how to get up they headed into the water and caught wave after wave. We highly recommend Houtan for your surfing lessons!  Have fun!</text>

My lesson this past weekend was super informative and relaxed. Rode the most waves I've ever caught during a single session thanks to Houtan. Hes got an impressively good eye for wave behavior. It was pretty cold so I didnt always have max awareness of my motions and positioning so it was also nice to get his feedback after every other wave. Great class and time!</text>

Houtan is great. I signed up 3 of my friends to get them onboard with surfing. He was easy to reach and get a hold of. The boards and wetsuit that were provided were in good condition and were not worn or beat up in comparison to some other surf schools I’ve experienced.

The date and time he chose was based on the conditions of the swell and timing of the tide which were perfect for beginners. Solid session!</review>

Really great teacher. Be on and off this surfing thing for 7 years. Going here helped me learn how to read waves the right way, and paddle with proper form. Recommend this surfing school to anyone trying to learn to surf for the first time or trying to polish their skills< /Review>

Both Alex and Colston are great instructors. They are good at breaking down the techniques and have constantly pushed me to progress during each session.< /Text>

Houtan was an amazing teacher. It was my first time surfing for my birthday. I learned so much from just one class! I learned how to read the tides. Was able to stand up, even though I’m a very clumsy person. Definitely will take more classes at Cali Surf School. I’m addicted!< /review>

<Text>Houtan and Terry (sp?) were excellent instructors and we had a wonderful experience learning to surf. They were both very professional and a great instructor. The beach in Dana Point was great for beginners and we all had so much fun!! Highly recommend. Need to be patient with communication (texting was easiest) and setting up the appointment... but totally worth it! Thanks!!< /Text>< pics>

<review>Houtan was like a proud dad, reassuring and encouraging us novices to get out and start surfing. Not only did he help us both to stand up after only a few tries, but he gave us the confidence and skills we need to go out on our own next time. Highly recommended!< /review><user_name>Grenada Innovations< /user_name><Response>None</Response>< pics>

Houtan rocks!  It's been a dream of mine learn to surf with  my 9 year old to surf.  Houtan got us up and surfing in just one lesson.  He was kind, patient, and very helpful.  My son was down on himself because he didn't make every wave.  Houtan took the time to support my son and tell him he crushed it.   We're hooked.  Buying the gear we need now.  Houtan also gave us awesome pictures and helped us figure out the right gear.  Thanks Houtan.  We'll see you soon< /Text>

Had tons of fun during my session with Alex who was very knowledgeable and super friendly. I felt safe the whole time I was in the water with him. It was my first time on a board but I managed to stand for a couple of second a number of times which was really cool! This was a great experience, I would highly recommend to anyone.< /Text>

Awesome experience with a great instructor. Alex was very friendly and made me feel comfortable throughout the lesson. He does not waste time and will let you know exactly what you did wrong the previous run so that you can really improve during the lesson. It was my very first time surfing and I was able to stand up after only a few tries. Highly recommend!!</Text>

Houtan was very accommodating, we had limited availability and he was able to provide a great lesson for my daughter on short notice.  She is new to surfing and surfed bigger waves than ever and she had a blast doing it! He provided her with great safety tips before heading out and was very supportive and made it fun. The photos and videos were great also-we will 100% book again when we are back on the west coast!< /Review>

I signed up my daughter for a surfing lesson while she's on summer break, but when I started searching for surfing lessons, most of them were pretty pricey, but then I found the Cali Surf School which was affordable and when my daughter went for her first lesson, she loved it so much! Alex is an amazing surfing instructor, he's very positive, and he loves what he's doing. I highly recommend him to anyone that wants to learn how to surf.</Text>

Alex was absolutely amazing with my 13 year old daughter. Let’s start with the wonderful swimming lesson, YES he taught her to swim in one day I was amazed myself. He was very patient and thorough. The next day he taught her to surf and YES she actually caught a few waves before her lesson was through. My Facebook page has been the talk of all my family and friends shocked to see my daughter surfing on her own. I would highly recommend Cali Surf School, they are very professional and able to teach all levels. Working with Alex was one of the highlights of our vacation and my daughter hasn’t been able to stop smiling about her experience luckily I recorded so she can relive those great moments. Thanks again!</Review>

It was wonderful experience. We were a totally beginner, so we were heading to Newport beach. Newport beach was really nice for beginner and 7:00 AM class was also good! Chen (?), the teacher was really nice to us. Oh !  And he took a picture for us using his Gopro. We didn't think about that, so it was impressing !
I want to go there 2-3 times more!!!</text>

<Review>Alex and Houtan are by far the most empathetic, fun, patient, and knowledgeable surf coaches EVER! I often forget that they are my coaches and I wasn't just meeting up with a friend. You'll spend the entire time laughing and, consequently, the lesson slips by too quickly. I have had the privilege of being taught by both. They each have their own unique styles and contributions to your artillery. I have also introduced several friends to them and what I have seen friends accomplish in one lesson is more than I had done after attempting to surf for months, prior to finding them. If I could afford to see them every single day, I happily would. Surfing, unfortunately, hasn't come naturally to me, but having coaches that make me feel safe and confident does keep me enchanted and motivated.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Such a great time with Alex! He helped my friend and I learn the basics of surfing. He was patient, constantly had high fives, and we spent just about the whole time in the water. I definitely want to come back next time I’m in town to get more lessons!!< /text>

He not only explained the basics of safety, but also what to look for with tides and wind.
The lesson was so much fun, he was encouraging and so helpful throughout the entire session.
I will definitely will book more sessions.
I recommend everyone to give this sport a shot.... it’s a total body work out that is fun along the way.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>Houtan is such a great instructor who taught us not just how to navigate the waves but how to do it safely.  He was patient and gave us great guidance to ensure that our session is meaningful and most of all FUN.  We cannot wait to have another session with him.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>Houtan went out of his way to squeeze in my daughter and I. He is a top notch instructor and an even better person! He made us feel like we were professionals! Haha.

Alex was a fantastic surf teacher! He explained things well, was very encouraging, and managed to effortlessly teach our group of 6 during our lesson. When we arrived, he had the boards and wetsuits all ready to go. Very chill and professional.< /Text>

Houtan is an excellent surf instructor! He brings so much positive energy to every surf lesson. He provided video recordings which help a lot in improving my technique. He teaches you how to read the ocean and how to be safe. Most of all he makes the surf lesson fun! I strongly recommend him.</review>

I booked a lesson with Alex and had a great time! Booked a lesson for me and my daughter. He was easy to get a hold of, willing to accommodate our schedule and provided good instructions to the meet up location. In the water he was super attentive and generous with his time. If you're looking to get into surfing hes a good guy to get started with. This was the second time our for my daughter (different school/place the first time) and by mid lesson she was standing up and riding waves all the way to the shore. As for me I've been struggling to pop up consistently - and while everyone else kept putting me on 9'6 boards and larger he put me on an 8' totally expecting to suck and turns out I had the best day ever. Tl;dr: want to learn to surf, book a lesson with this guy< /Text>

<Text>My brother and I had an absolute blast this past weekend. It was our first time surfing and Houtan was an outstanding instructor. He was clear, succinct and conveyed the importance of safety in the water. We were both able to get up on the boards relatively quickly and from there - it was just pure fun. Houtan was kind enough to take videos/photos as part of a package and it's awesome to have some tangible memories from such a special morning! 5 stars to Houtan and the Cali Surf School. Would give 6 stars if I could - don't hesitate and book today!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

My son is 9 and I asked him if he wanted to learn to surf assuming he'd say no. But to my surprise, he wanted to give it a shot. Knowing he'd never been in the ocean I was sure there was no way he could learn in a 2 hour training session. We met Alex at Venice beach and before I could get my camera out, my son was standing on a surfboard in the Pacific ocean. My mind was blown!!! Mission successful! Alex has a gift and it made my son's trip to California from Louisiana a huge success! He'll have stories for days when he starts school and as a father I couldn't be more proud of my boy! Thank you Alex for giving him an experience he won't forget! I highly recommend Alex and Cali Surf School. Can't wait to get my 6 year old little girl out there next!</review>

Houtan is an amazing teacher! I did a surf lesson at Dana point and paddle boarding from laguna beach and had a great experience both times. He's really knowledgeable about the sea and marine life and has you up on the board in no time. Highly recommend these lessons!<//review>

<Text>Houtan was not only detailed in his instructions for me and my boyfriend's first lesson but he set us up for full success that my boyfriend and I were up on our first and second tries respectively. Grateful doesn't begin to describe how I felt during and after our lesson! You want to learn how to nail a new skill that will help you stay physically active and make you feel the most incredible endorphin filled rush? Book with Houtan, today!< /Text>< pics>

Learning to surf was #1 on my bucket list, and after searching around, i decided to go with Cali Surf School and I couldn't be happier!

Had a private lesson with Alex, and it was amazing! Punctual, thorough, passionate,  and a great guy.

After some stretching and breathing to get the mind and body ready, he took me through the technical aspects of the board, how to read the waves, how position myself on the board, and how to ride, all in easy-to-understand instructions, and always with a huge smile on both our faces. If there was 10 stars available, I'd still give him 11.

Don't hesitate for one second, this guy is the real deal, and he got me surfing!

Alex, thank you bro!

Houtan was an incredible surf instructor! He took the time to plan the lesson around our schedule and truly made the 90 minutes worthwhile. Houtan is a surfing pro and made me feel so comfortable practicing on the board before hitting the water. Once in, he was there to help and guide me the entire time. It was a great plus that he had a go pro to take pictures and videos for my boyfriend and I. We will definitely reach out to him again on our next trip to Cali!!!</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Houtan was such a great instructor! I speak especially to beginners afraid of being a flopping, blubbering mess in attempts to catch a wave...call these guys, you won't regret it! I've never stepped foot on a surfboard before and Houtan took the time to explain the basics of not only surfing, but also how to read/time the waves and safety, and gave us demonstrations on land before getting in the water. I've had more than a fair share of traumatic drowning incidents in the past in the ocean, but I felt safe with Houtan close by with encouragement and guidance with each of the many, many falls during the session. By the end, I was finally able to get up, gain confidence, and ride out a couple waves! Definitely more than worth the drive, time, and money! Very fun, approachable, laid back, and skilled/experienced instructor...highly recommended!!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Our son and daughter had so much fun learning from an awesome instructor, Houtan Sarraf. He did his homework to suggest the best time of day for the tide and the waves and that Newport beach is a great place to first learn to surf. Houtan had them standing on boards in no time at all. He seemed just as excited as we were seeing them surf for the first time. An AMAZING instructor!!<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Houtan is surely the man! I wouldn't consider myself athletic, but after the first lesson with Houtan, I caught my first wave. I'm definitely hooked! Houtan has a way of teaching that is easy to understand. Thank you!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>Cali Surf School rocks! My instructor Houtan was super attentative, his confidence, and know how was contagious. Before this I had not surfed before, but because of him when I first got in the water I was in the zone and stood up almost immediately. Since then I've been surfing with him for alittle more then a year, and I'm excited for next season when we are going to work on shortboarding!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>We had my nephew and niece (ages 5 and 9) visiting from Arizona and was givien Houtan’s number by a friend for surf lessons. The kids had a blast and Houtan was very informative and patient. Maybe my wife and I will give it a try one day but for the time being we’ll call Houtan when the kids come to visit as it was the highlight of their trip.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>(Translated by Google) Our first visit to Laguna Beach, my 2 girls had their first surf lesson with Cali Surf School. Great experience, our appointment was on time. All equipment was included as agreed. The yard was very professional.
And the girls loved their experience.
I recommend this company

I'm a fairly regular patron of Redwing and have been for many years.  It is one of the best dive bars in San Diego that recently (about a year ago) got a bit of a refresh.  It did not lose it's neighbourhood charm with the refresh though, thankfully.  Tracy is my fave bartender!  She remembers everyone even when you haven't been in the bar in a year.  Somehow she even remembers how I love my turkey burger.  That brings me to my point: Redwing turkey burgers are the best burger in San Diego.  That is not an exaggeration either.  I don't eat red meat and I hate veggie burgers well because they're always terrible and the black bean burgers are usually tasteless but when I found the turkey burger at RBG I ate one every day for about 2 weeks.  I've turned hardcore carnivores into a lover of these burgers, too!  I'm sure it is the juices and stuff on the grill from everything else that makes these so delicious but who cares they are...they should be sampled by everyone.  They are always perfectly cooked with the right amount to char and are always super juicy and importantly they are not flattened to death by the chef.
RBG has great drink prices and happy hours plus there is a fantastic jukebox and they have karaoke a couple/few times a week.  If you come in and it's a bit crowded make your way straight through the bar out to the patio where there is a second bar.  The patio bar is usually open Friday through Sunday.< /Review>

< review>
Went here for karaoke on a Saturday -- GET HERE EARLY FOR KARAOKE. We showed up at 7:30 and it was already packed. We lucked out with a group leaving bar seats. There's plenty of seating in the back for food, but you can't hear the karaoke from the back, so it's pretty much just for people getting food. The food is actually pretty amazing for bar food. Only down side was the lack of seating for karaoke and the lack of parking, otherwise, I will be back!</review>

<text>The night I visited this place, it was full to it's capacity. It was as the young kids say "lit" there was karaoke, drinks, the atmosphere was super friendly and everyone was singing along to all of the songs. They have pretty good drinks and good happy hour deals as well. Would recommend to go with friends or for a date night.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyF9AAeI9aPHtScQWK9t6zxH0nkAwWfrJIaV80=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNI4q4Zx25c7gRopki4njqiK63Cb_nRSCmZkb3t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqtRNRrXEQwwZkWj8Y0FywlRfJgJ3uMtRmtdWO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80d954f6e2a7ed6f:0x5cf3d08bf850b37e<//GmapID></record>

One of my favorite bars in Hollywood.  Reasonably (by LA standards) priced drinks, friendly staff, good ambiance, and great music.  Somehow, Redwing Bar & Grill manages to escape the pretentiousness of other area watering holes.As others have said, gets a bit crowded on weekend nights (what decent bar doesn't?) but we've never had an issue getting in or getting drinks.<//text>

<Text>It's nice for the Karaoke since there is an app for selections and includes all the public favorites. Pretty small place but never had any issues with service. The crowd is usually pretty interactive with the singers on stage even if they are bad. You should feel comfortable singing your heart out here.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80d954f6e2a7ed6f:0x5cf3d08bf850b37e<//Gmap_id><userid>102025904518848783406< /userid><Response>None</Response>< Rating>

<text>My home away from home. Not only have I made so many great memories here, but got to know the staff who are just some of the most awesome people you'll ever meet. From drunken nights singing my heart out to karaoke, to unwinding from a long day of work on the back patio this place is great for every occasion. Never a dull moment here. But seriously the staff here is like top notch. There was even a time where I needed help keeping creeps away from a friend of mine and everyone rallied together and 86'ed the dude so quick. I've never felt so safe and well looked after at a bar before. This is my go to place forever. I can't say enough positive things about this place. To the bartenders, the Djs, the security team, and everyone else in between... you guys are amazing 🖤</text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Like a lot of places in SD the bar is too skinny. So at busy times you spend time navigating people and trying to find a good spot. When you do you gotta anchor yourself there. Which takes out a lot of the fun. Decent beer selection<//review>

We used to be lifelong fans before tonight. During covid we asked a couple to move away because they were in violation of the 6ft rule(literally touching us). They said they would not move. When we told an employee they said this is a bar! He did nothing. If I could I would leave zero stars. I do not recommend this establishment. I would suggest seven grand or coin op if you’re in the area. Do not come here during covid as they do NOT Do a good job of enforcing social distancing.<//text>

<review>***Hands down, the GREATEST karaoke venue in San Diego!!!***

Pros: free karaoke every single night, public performance stage, cool Karaoke DJs, friendly and personable staff, backdoor open patio with their own bar for those who don't want to be immersed into the karaoke crowd, interesting Happy Hour specials, NO COVER EVER, and very supportive and colorful karaoke crowd, Karaoke app.

Cons: Because of it's popularity, the wait time can be VERY EXTENSIVE, this is especially true on Thursday/Friday/Saturday nights. Because it's popular, venue can get cramped, especially after 10PM. So much fun, I wish this place stayed open longer.</review>< pics>

Great N. Park bar for people watching, karaoke, decent bar food and specials. Try the burger and beer special around $7-8. Plus, they have an awesome outdoor area in the back, with an extra bar, for smokers or people who want some fresh air (cough cough). Bartenders are friendly and fast, which is important because this place gets packed!</Review>

It's a small bar but has a large serving area so it's not hard to get a drink when you're ready. Can get a bit crowded and seating is an issue if it starts to get packed. Definitely very loud and caters to a younger crowd but the crowd gets oddly diverse some nights. Clean bathrooms. Prices are what you'd expect for North Park but the bartenders seem to know what they are doing.<//Text>

<Text>Would definitely recommend It's pretty cool for your basic karaoke bar. It's very small and gets crowded easily. Especially weekends! The drink prices make up for the lack of wiggle room.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80d954f6e2a7ed6f:0x5cf3d08bf850b37e</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Everyday they have a special. The food that they have on special is of good quality and is cooked to perfection every time. The drinks are cheap and the Karaoke is always fun. Some very talented singers come through here and they are always entertaining. I never have any drama here and it always a good time here. The security is adamant about proper ID, but he's chill.</text>

< review>
I didn't know it was a "gay bar," if that is what you call them now-a-days, but apparently on a Sunday night, at these kind of bars (what ever you call them) people are supposed to act really uptight, but I didn't feel like acting uptight, and I was having so much fun, so they kicked me out, but I refused to leave until they let me sing a song, because it was karaoke night (which I guess is every night)--hopefully not the same uptight DJ as was there on super-bowl Sunday.  But anyway I digress; I was having so much fun, but I was "Being too animated?!?!(WFT?)" is what the bouncer told me before he asked me to leave. But I said I bought an expensive 7 dollar drink, and gave a 2 dollar tip, so I expect to be able to sing a song before you kick me out of no reason.  So they let me sing a song, "Stray Cat Strut," but the uptight (and very jealous) DJ, tweaked all the sounds to make it sound horrendous. as he does I guess for most non-local people, because I couldn't believe that a sound system can not purposely sound that bad.  But other than that, I had a splendid time talking to Amy, the Aries (who probably thought I was gay) or her girl friends wouldn't have let me talk to her that  long (they did pry her away from me and forced me out of their circle a few times when I tried to come back and say hi again), But if I ever came back, when that uptight DJ and uptight bouncer are there, I'd probably get kicked out again, if not beaten up,  So it's safe to say, I probably won't go back nor I did, either.  How does it get even better than that?  What group of sweaty grown men throwing balls at each other played in that game this afternoon, I don't know or care.  I'm not into profession male sports.  I guess I'm a lesbian in a man's body, but that's not acceptable at such places yet.</review>

<text>Had a lot of fun here. The drinks are cheap and STRONG, especially for the area. They have karaoke up front with a pool table and stage that make the place feel a little divey, but they also have a patio in the back that's nicer and calmer. No cover when I went and they staff was super entertained when we were playing games in line outside.</text>< Date>

Good bar that is usually packed on the weekends. It can get pretty tight in there but they have karaoke on the weekends and a patio you can smoke on. Also a bar in the bike, would go here again. I'm pretty sure it leads more towards the gay bar side but its still a really good time. Also, at the end of the night there is a little taco stand right outside it, holy balls best tacos ever and super cheap.<//text>

I have been going to this place since I was legal, that would be 1991. Due to great management and a sight into the future. The Red Wing as continued to increase its quality.
With the onslaught of breweries and increased competition, this place stays strong and beats the at every turn.
If you do not stop on, then you will have missed out.<//review>

This place is rad.  Karaoke every night which is obviously the best. Don't go in here expecting to be treated well though. Half the time I'm ignored, and the head bartender or manager is catty AF. I almost left as soon as I went in the first time I went, but I'm glad I didn't.  Once I realized that's just the way the bartender is and decided not to take his comments personally I had a great time, but make sure to get your songs in early if you want to sing.</text>

<review>First time here. Went to celebrate friends that just got married. Drinks are good and pretty decently priced. They also serve pitchers of beer. Munchie food is good. Ordered the chicken tenders with fries and also 2lbs of wings. Tried the thai chili flavor-very good, but a little too hot for my taste. They also had karaoke which started at 8pm. Very fun!</review><name>Diana Slaughter< /name>< Gmap_id>

Great place.  Ten dollar minimum if you use a card.  They have food if you arrive before 9, the wings are pretty good.  Can get a bit crowded and hard to order a drink at the bar.  They do karaoke a lot, so it's great to go have some wings and a beer, sing a song, and move on throughout North Park.<//Text>

This is an extremely lovable hole in the wall where some of the best nights of my life have taken place. The atmosphere is fun and welcoming no matter who you are or where your from. Whether your there to sing, dance or just watch, there karaoke nights are an absolute blast; even better, it happens 7 nights a week. It is a tiny space, and after a certain hour it gets super packed; usually with attractive people so the close proximity doesn't bother me. I will say, though that this becomes an issue for any woman that needs to use the restroom. There's only one stall and almost always a line. Other than that tiny setback, if you're looking for a fun place to go out I strongly recommend you give this place a try.< /Text>

Been here a few times for a Meetup group. Love the LGBT friendly crowd. Bartenders always nice and sometimes fun and sassy. Smoking is allowed on the back patio. They have karaoke on Fridays.</Text>

One of my favorite spots in San Diego. Karaoke every night though it gets busy on weekends so come early so you can get in and get to sing! They have Tony there as a karaoke DJ now and he's so amazing!!< /review>

Great service, food, atmosphere, and pours! Diverse crowd, can be quiet, but often loud on weekends. Outdoor bar is great, I'll keep coming back!< /Review>

<review>Always great food and drinks but the best is the awesome owner/managers and helpful friendly staff. What sets this bar apart from others is the mixed clientele.

Redwing is supposed to be the 'gay bar' on North Park but in the last year (2013-2014) it's definitely become overrun with hipsters and straight allies.  Now don't me wrong I'm down with hipsters and allies but damn don't take over queer spaces y'all.

That aside they have a decent sized back patio (smoking section) and AC inside with several TV to watch the game.  They've also started carrying more craft beer and Thursday nights they have great trivia.

This is the place you want to karaoke!!!!  They have a good selection of songs and karaoke almost every night.</review>

Why do I come to Redwing? Because they literally offer karaoke EVERY night of the week!

There are two bars in Redwing. One services the front end of Redwing. The other is out on the outdoor patio. The build out is deceptively large.

PROPS: For a "gay bar" I've never felt like Redwing catered to a specific audience. They're a generally solid spot to spend your evening.
SLOPS: It's a dive bar. (although maybe you're looking for that kind of thing  ^_^)<//text>

Always so much fun. There is karaoke every night starting around 8ish I believe. Drinks are decently priced and Jell-O shots for 2 bucks for some fun. There is a Pool table if you're into it. It is one of those few places in SD where everyone goes no matter how you identify.</Review>

Strong drinks and great burgers with tots. Always a fun night when karaoke begins and sometimes I'm blown away by an amazing singer. Lot of fun with a trendy dive bar vibe.  A good mix of people.< /Text>

My favorite wing spot is SD, especially Monday nights after 6pm when they're priced at $5/pound. Wings are prepared from scratch in their little, itty bitty kitchen on the side of the bar. Fantastic place to kick back and enjoy a beer or cocktail. Karaoke is a regular thing.<//review>

<review>My go to bar in SD. Very all inclusive no matter who you are or love. Karaoke is exciting, people are friendly, drinks are stiff (especially on the patio), food is amazing but stopped by 10/11pm most nights. There is a wait to get in but no cover... this also applies to the bathrooms 🚻.<//review>< rate>

Heaven in your neighborhood! The bartender took 10 minutes to come and take my order. When he finally did he said the drink was on him for his tardiness. What?! How could I not keep coming back. Karaoke every night just is an added bonus.
Tipping was effortless!</text>

Hector the security guard has a problem with "power".   He is unplesant and rude.  I had no problem with him personally, but did notice his rude behavior more than once,  toward others.  You can maintain security without being a jerk.  He needs to be evaluated... Otherwise, the wings are great and the bar staff and kitchen are great!<//review>

But most importantly, this is a business that treats it's employees & customers with love & respect. Would give it 5 stars but the entire patio needs to be covered in the wet months of the year. Sarah is the owner so if you see her tell her she has revived this establishment.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Been going there for new years for the past 4 years was so disappointed this year karaoke was terrible songs  Terrible they were playing the frozen anthem who want  That on New years  Had to leave the poor bartender she wore  glittery shorts what is this world coming  Spent less than a quarter of the money I usually spend and left early. We will be looking for a new spot for next year.<//Review><time>1546334038864< /time>< Rating>

Bar / Karaoke:

Not really my scene. Didn't feel like it stood out for me in any particular area, plus, I am not a fan of low quality bar food. I think if you are going here to meet up with people it could be and is a good place to do that, and their outdoor area is convenient for the same. Otherwise, not really a place for me.</text>

<Review>The karaoke host was not friendly at all and not well received. When I first got there, She asked me to buy her a drink and I did. After I did she told me I was singing too many songs (I sang 2) At which point she told me to move away from her both as if I was going to start a fight I told her okay. And she was confused (not to say I wasn’t annoyed but the way she was carrying on) I told her I would leave but appreciated her.  When I started to tell my friends she asked me to stay. I am a good paying customer and was New there. I was unaware of any cap on the amount one could sing. I tipped my bartender well. but I won’t go there again. Treat customers better. Be up front with policies. If singing with my friends at their request is inappropriate let me know. I’ll stop. This is the first time in my life. She called people in her order not in the order people signed up.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
Always overcrowded, takes hours to get a song in, bartenders are rude, and sound is so loud you have to yell over the singers just to have a conversation, thereby exhausting the voice too much to sing properly, and drinks are overpriced.  Not my favorite place for karaoke.  Much prefer Caliph that often has beer on special for $3.50.<//Review>

Love everything including the food, cocktails, prices and karaoke...even use to the bathroom situation and sometimes lines for men and women. Not a fan of the waiting outside to get in due to capacity increases... Maybe do a small patio situation in front sti people can at least get a drink will they wait.</Text>

<Review>Karaoke is too much for me and the Ipa' s are  expensive....theres only 2 on draft.  They have some cool specials sometimes but I've said to myself so many times that I'm never going back.

Leaving two instead of one because it's a cool place to hide at while you're doing laundry next door.</Review>< gmapID>

This is a great neighborhood bar with great food in a great neighborhood. Every bartender I've met so far has got a great personality and are happy to include you in conversations with other new folks and regulars.

I've been twice and had the wings both times and they were excellent also have a dish they called Chick A Rones which are chicken thigh and skin cook very crispy like a chicharron and with a spicy dipping sauce. This is a really excellent dish. I'm looking forward to going back and try new dishes.
I do want to mention that one of the sauces that they offer for dipping or salads or whatever is a cilantro cream sauce which as a lover of cilantro I can highly recommend.

They have lots of lots of different beers on tap as well as the old standby as in bottle and can, I especially like the selection of tall boys  they offer, especially if you like to drink old school!!</Text>

I have been going here since 1981. When Sara took over just over 9 yrs ago a lot of changes(for the Good) have been made... Kareoke 7days a week and GREAT FOOD... My Partner and I meet on February 24th 2005 there and got Married on June 21st 2008... it is a Very Friendly Bar with a Mixed Crowd... The Best Bar in San Diego by far.</Text>

<Review>Great Bartenders and food(cooks) and owner,Sara.
November 15th  2018 update. Ivas did his magic
Pork belly up ,although I have to say anyone in that small kitchen does a "fabulous job!"  And there is a nice big "plastic jar" to show your appreciation!!  I do! TRACY DOING HER MAGIC with her superb "service to others" we know her heart is in the right place in this world of "Ego Mind" , service to self mentality. Soon to disappear! And good riddance to it! PARDIGM SHIFT COMING SAID HERE FIRST.And I see Sara has the construction workers putting the final touches in the "glorious new bathrooms" and wall counters!! A little  inconvenience is worth the outcome when it is done right. A BIG BRAVO!!!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80d954f6e2a7ed6f:0x5cf3d08bf850b37e</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I can't say much on the bar. But the back patio is amazing. As is their Elementary burger with peanut butter and honey aioli. Beyond delicious and unique.< /text>

A pretty poor setup with their bathrooms directly in the hallway that connects the outdoor patio (with bar) to the main room. A fun space to people watch for karaoke or join in, if you'd like.<//Text>

Karaoke was great, but the 1 person bathrooms was a bummer and the drinks were nothing special. Had a completely wrong drink made for me with no clarification asked.< /review>

<username>Jen Moreno<//username><Review>Came here for a drink after work one day with some coworkers. They had happy hour all night long. Cant really go wrong with $5 wells but can't expect much either. The sauce that comes with the green beans was delish as was the redwing burger. I didnt think much of the habanero cream cheese at first but it sneaks up! My only gripe is that I wish the pasilla peppers had been grilled but it was still pretty yummy! Would definitely try again.</Review>< Response>

Food is midgrade during normal business hours, above-average by late-night standards. This is the place for karaoke. Sometimes the line is long, but i've seen a line as short as 4 people on a Friday.<//Review>

< Review>
The bouncer today noticed that my friend's ID was expired. He offered to let us bribe him for $10 to enter on an expired ID. Meanwhile, we stepped aside, and my friend pulled out his Driver's License, and noticed that it had a different expiration than the "State ID Card" and was not expired. When we approached the bouncer again, he said we had to go to the back of the line, even though we were just a few feet away finding his ID. Bad service.<//Review>
