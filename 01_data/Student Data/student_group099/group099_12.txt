Everything is very clean, calm and professional.  The therapists I have had are wonderful. It is pretty expensive though.</Text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>Don't ever EVER sign up for a membership. I repeat. Don't sign up for the membership. They will not let you cancel!!! I fulfilled my contract, paying for a whole full year (12 months) while barely going because I could not afford the tips but did not want to stiff the hard workers. When it came to time to cancel, however, I showed up at the store, and guess what? The front desk girl did not have authority to cancel!! Yeah right, they could sign you up but could not cancel you. And there is no cancellation form whatsoever that was mentioned in the contract! I need to wait for a manager to get back to me in 1 week, which would NOT happen.

If I could give this place 0 star, I would!!!! They are NOT letting you cancel so they can keep charging you every month whether you're going to go or not.<//text>< pictures>

My session with Brent was relaxing! He checked to make sure that he would be addressing my ‘target’ areas for massage. The 90 -minute session left me invigorated and muscle soreness relieved! I also appreciated  the friendliness and professionalism of the front desk staff!<//Review>

HORRIBLE experience. I am a single mom to twins and so my free time is very limited. I was SO excited to come in this morning for my 90 minute massage that I had booked at the beginning of the week, so much so that I got up early on my only day off and drove all the way to folsom from downtown. When I arrived the black lady who claimed to be the "manager" at the front desk, informed me she had no appointment for me and when I was visibly upset she proceeded to tell me it was my fault it wasn't booked properly and that I should have known I would receive a confirmation text when it was actually booked. She was dumber than a box of rocks and repeatedly mocked and laughed at me. I left in tears and would honestly never come back. Massage Envy needs to reconsider who they hire because they are driving business away with their incompetent employees.<//text>

<Review>Nathan Jones is the best.  He has changed me life with his medical massage . He has his own mobile service also and another site you can visit him at .

Don’t ever sign up for auto pay through message envy .   You will have to close you bank account to get them to stop charging you , even after you fulfill your contract.  After 4 visits requesting to stop auto pay without success , I made a bank claim and changed my card number .  And now they have sent me to collections !  Really bad customer service .< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Well, its complaint time. Today's topic; Massage Envy. They debited the wrong account & will not refund my money. I will never ever never ever ever never ever ever ever do business with them again. Oh and Massage Envy, I'm getting all new cards with all new numbers. So go ahead keep trying to debit closed accounts. If I could post this with no stars I would have. and if be chance Massage Envy agree to refund my money, I will agree to re-post a better, more positive review.
After further review, no acceptable arrangement could be made, therefore I have cancelled my credit card, I will not be using the services again. They can bill me if they wish but I will not be using them ever again after the financial turmoil they caused by charging the wrong card and conveniently misplacing the CC info they should have charged. If I could post no STARS I would have.< /review>< gmapID>

<time>1417017966800</time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>2 years and $2520 later we are finally free of Massage Envy!

Wife and I visited this massage envy on Christmas vacation two years ago. An employee told us that if we signed up for memberships we could cancel them anytime within the first 30 days. Well, we weren't impressed with the massages so we did attempt to cancel them several days later. We were told that there is no 30-day cancellation policy and that no employee would have told us otherwise.

Because we were on vacation our memberships had to be transferred to Washington, which later came back to bite us as well. The local shop didn't have all our records, so their record of our 'months served' was different from the actual payments we had made. Unfortunately we were not diligent about arguing with them on this point, and we ended up paying for around 18 months instead of 12. We also had our accounts frozen for 6 months, yielding the grand total time served at 24 months.

Finally, please note that the monthly membership does not include tip to the therapist. The therapist's wage assumes that tips will be made, so there is an ethical obligation to pay $10-$20 per 'free massage'. I make no comment as to whether this is fair, but it is something to budget for when considering the total cost of the membership (and something that we initially overlooked).<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I am only giving 1 star because you can't give zero stars and still give a review.  Cheap features, high pressure sales, and disgusting massage therapists (if they can be called that).  Moreover, they are after your money--and that's it.  They don't care if you have a good experience or a bad experience.  Never go to this place and your life will be better...< /text><Name>Russell Enyart<//Name><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Beautiful church but the people who give the food away are very very rude mean and nothing like a Cristian place should be. None of them know English They favor to their own Color I felt like I was very much hated on. They give good food out. The only what they want you to have. Not Everything that's there.</Review><Rating>4<//Rating><user_id>100880441081824928886<//user_id><gmap_id>0x80c2cf4ccec91e85:0x64e886449a72b617< /gmap_id><Name>Barbara Torok<//Name><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

Father Gustavo is very caring and nice. I like that he greets all parishioners and I enjoy his sermons. I wish there were more priest like him.< /Review>

I have to say that this church is very big, but it's not as nice as the other Catholic Churches. This place has comfortable benches that make listening to mass great. The nuns and priests are nice and make the mass better. There is a lot of parking which makes Sunday mass better and some Sundays they also have a mini fair and bingo night.</text>

Know few people that are monagillos at this church whom are so evil and disgusting out of church. They think just because they're church people they could treat other people mean and make them feel like garbage with there actions. Those people are the whole reason why i don't go to this church, since they still work there and plus they bring me bad memories.</Review>

I like it because it's local but it's expensive compared to other beauty supplies and they don't allow returns or exchanges..

I don't like doing business anywhere I can't return or at least exchange an item... I bought hair for braiding that I ended up not being able to use because my braider said it would cut her fingers....It was never opened and I had the receipt and they wouldn't let me bring it back so I'm stuck with five packs of hair that I can never use...

If it was a wig or something I could see, but something in a package that has clearly never been opened you should at least be able to exchange!

This is a policy that is typical of a lot of Asian Merchants which is why I don't do swap meets and don't really like to patronize them because it's not the American way...

So due to their no exchange policy, I will not be shopping there again..</text>

This is the very first time purchasing something in this store,  they have really good customer service,  well the girl who helped me was really nice, while trying to make up my mind about the product I was thinking about purchasing,  a man approached us and said 30% off for father's day. I think he was the owner! That was nice of him, the only thing I didn't like about this store is,  "store credit only"</Text>

Beautiful store. Well stocked,  friendly staff, owner is in the store and ready to help weather he needs to look for something or reorder it for next day delivery.  I would definitely be making it my daily Go to for my salon but it's a lil out of the way for more than a weekly visit. I will be back for sure and often<//review>

<text>I've been searching for a wig store around my house for a while now and decided just go in here on a whim. Man, I'm so glad I did!! They have so many different types of wigs available-and they allow you to try them on (with the purchase of a $1 wig cap) which is awesome since not many places let you do that. I went in looking for something very specific-a yellow lace front wig and I mean a bright yellow. Instead of just telling me no they didn't have that, they actually took the time to look for some wigs that were similar. Despite not being a bright yellow, they ended up showing me one that I really loved so I went ahead and purchased it! They have this stamp card too that once you purchase 4 lace wigs, your 5th one is 40% off which is pretty cool-and I know I'll use it since I'm always buying wigs! I was really nervous going in here that the service wasn't going to be that great or that they wouldn't have anything I liked, but I was very impressed with this store. The customer service was amazing and their selection of products was huge! Besides just wigs, they also carry a ton of different beauty supplies like hair care products, make up and others things. Definitely my new favorite beauty supply store. I highly recommend it!<//text>< user>

<Text>Wish I could put 0 stars but unfortunately that isn’t an option. So I bought a wig from there that was supposed to be human hair. When it came down to dying it & bleaching it, nothing happened to the hair(mind you it was a profesional that has worked doing this for over 20 years that looked at this hair & tried bleaching it). She told me it WASN’T human hair ! Don’t buy wigs or bundles or anything from this place because they sell fake stuff y’all! Don’t waste your money, & be careful what you buy because they will not refund or exchange anything</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I really liked the store until my experience today. I work across the street . But we didn’t have the product that I wanted so  me and my coworkers usually go there. So I wanted to buy a cap and apron, the cap prices at $3.99.. what a deal! I was going to buy them both with my discount. But the guy that’s always in the front ignored me when the girl rang me up and the cap price was different. I kept calling the man in the store that walked away from the girl and told her to charge me what it rang up. Not the price that was advertised. We then are going back and forth I tell him you have to honor the price advertised. He then begins to tell me Walmart make mistakes to you still go there... I’m like no that has nothing to do with it. He then goes to where the caps where and removes the price tag and tells me he’s going to fired the guy that did this. Again, that has nothing to do with me. I took a picture or the price tag earlier. He got mad after I showed him the picture, and said he was going to call the police! ( for what) I said do whatever you want. I told the girl at the register to just ring me up for the product I initially came in for and forget the apron and cap! He wouldn’t do it nor give the discount displayed for even that!! And asked me why I took the picture and he was calling the police!! And to go to my work and get the product.!!  I’m done!!!  Very ignorant, unprofessional, Unacceptable Behavior!!<//text>

I went here last week for earrings and immediately felt welcomed, I bought one item and they were quick to sign me up for a beauty4U card for future discount purchases , I didn't feel lost. I got help from one of the employees,  It was a nice store with a variety of supplies. I definently plan on going back soon for some hair stuff .</review>

I was looking for a better insurance than the one that I had and Farmers came through with a better policy. They were efficient and affordable, they also were quick to respond to all my questions. Unlike my previous insurance they were always out of the office & never got back to me when I needed them. Thank Farmers for your great service.<//review>

The overall process was pretty smooth, especially being able to sign the documents electronically. The agent (Blanca T.) answered all questions I had throughout the process. The main reason I dropped 1 star was for them not having a mobile app at this time. The insurance I was quoted was not directly with Farmers but a subsidiary (Farmers auto specialty). I understand this might be nitpicking however I enjoy the easy of doing everything on a phone app for the convenience.</text>

<review>Hello My name is Jose Ortiz I recently changed insurance and I have been in so many diffrent insurance but I have never gotten more support then with Farmers Insurance. The first time I tried it I had an agent named Dan Kitajima who helped me in every step. They would always be polite and put customers first. I would recommend to anyone this insurance has great quality, great response, great value for a great price.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I had farmers insurance else where but I switched here because of the great customer service. Whenever I have an issue they resolve it immediately. They are transparent with everything and clear explanations are given of my coverage and any questions I have. I went through so many auto insurances, I feel confident with only this location. They really do hire professionals, they are resourceful towards everything. Thank you for everything!</Text>

<Text>I recently purchased a new car and needed insurance ASAP, Blanca Tapia was very helped me achieve that easily and quickly. I was able to get my car insured with no problem at all and I did not feel pressured to get insured with them like other companies tend to make you feel. She helped me understand what my policy will cover and was very patient with me as I had to do this process amidst a very busy work week as well as all through email. She was very efficient and helpful. Highly recommend!< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp><rating>5<//rating><time>1566954880321<//time>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I love the employees at this insurance agency. Everyone I’ve worked with there is always  willing to answer questions and really work with you to ensure you not only have the right coverage but an affordable coverage (which to me is paramount) .
Navigating insurance can be tedious but luckily the team there takes the stress off my shoulders and explains things to me in a kind way. I’ve never gone through an annoying phone tree - usually always a direct line to an agent. They also send holiday and birthday cards which is a nice touch I think!</Review><userid>113998739641151161705</userid>< time>

Dan Kitajima is really an awesome agent. He is honest, cool and super helpful. He has helped me get discounts; he helps when I have questions. He makes everything super easy. He is great at his job. I am very happy that I went with them :)< /review>< pics>

<text>I sold my previous vehicle about 2 weeks ago, and just got a new one yesterday.

The transition was done smoothly, quickly, and easily, OVER THE PHONE - you don't even need to be present, with Alexandra Q. along with really helpful advice.

I have been a client with this firm for about 3 years. And I can't recall a single complaint about its service. Keep it up, guys!

Thanks you!!!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I have and will continue to recommend Kitajima Agency to all my family and friends. Dan Kitajima and his agents are very helpful and always available when you have questions regarding your policy. They will even go out of their way to look for discounts to help YOU which is hard to find in an insurance agency.

If you have a bad driving record, you know that your insurance costs are horrible. I am so glad that I found Kitajima Agency because I am paying half of what I would be paying with other major carriers. They definitely saved my wallet!</text>

Great agency....great Insurance rep....very responsive. Dan was extremely helpful when I needed him most ( right after an accident ). Walked me through the process and put me on the "fast-track" in working with the claims adjuster and coordinating everything with the local auto body shop!
I recommend them highly! You won't be disappointed!<//review>

I love these extra opportunities to save! I was very happy with the customer service representative that handled my policy. Even though my payment is higher than some of the other company's that qouted me, I feel that the quality of my coverage is what matters most. Thank you for the quick and easy coverage, as well as the credit on my next monthly payment.< /Text>

<text>I have been with this Branch for a few years now didn't have any issues until I got earthquake policy with them I was given misinformation about the policy and when I called back to get it rectified I was told I would get a call back by an employee same day I did not I call back a few days later and I talked to the person who set up the policy I was told by her that I would get a call back after I explained the situation and she said she would talk to her billing department but I still didn't receive one I left several messages and it has been over a week now and I still have not received the call back I suspect that I'm not giving a call back because they are very well aware that they made a mistake and they don't want to own up to it I will not deal with an office that does not take care of its customers after given misinformation and not even giving the callbacks that they promised and it's been over a month and a half since the initial call I am not a complainer but this is definitely not how you handle customer service< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I had a perfect driving record for over 30 years until I got a misdemeanor DUI. Of course my insurance carrier decided to triple my premium even though I had so many years of good driving. As I shopped around and getting frustrated, I came upon Janet Diaz and the Kitajima Insurance Group. Not only did she work with me on a decent premium, they didn't make me feel like a convict...sometimes all we need is another chance and the Kitajima Agency provided me that. Thanks to Janet and the whole team.

I had an awesome experience with the Kitajima Agency when I was shopping for affordable automobile insurance early this summer.
Janet was very professional, knowledgable, friendly, and was able to offer the best rates of any of the companies that I spoke with regarding my situation.
I would highly recommend Farmers Insurance- Kitajima Agency if you are looking for auto insurance.

The Agency representatives have consistently answered or found answers to my every query and worked hard to give myself and son rates that seem fair and economical.  An honest agency in California no less.

Thank you Kitajima Agency and thank you Janet Lisa Diaz!

I heartily recommend to anyone who is seeking insurance for their health, life, auto, etc. the Kitajima Agency located in Tustin, CA.  From my first contact; until the final conversation; the staff were friendly;professional; and qualified regarding finding out what I was seeking to do and coming up with options that gave me a clear idea of the best program that was suitable for my needs.

I plan on referring the agency to any and all of my friends and associates for all of their insurance needs.< /Review>

I want to report that no company had been able to give me an Insurance at such a low cost as Farmers and the best thing is that too. They speak Spanish and their treatment is great !!

<rating>1<//rating><Review>(Translated by Google) Call to quote my 2013 Jeep grand cherokee, I gave my data they told me that then they would tell me the value when they call me back they tell me that the policy is around $ 440 I thought it must be a liability a year, when the girl tells me it is a month 😱 I asked him is it a policy or are they going to sell me another car, once again another lie that the price will be low it seems that the qualifications are from the same or relatives of those who work there is the first time they tell me that a car insurance per month $ 440

Llame a cotizar mi 2013 Jeep grand cherokee, di mis datos me dijeron que luego me decían el valor cuando me devuelven la llamada me dicen que la póliza es al rededor de $440  pensé debe ser una liability al año, cuando la chica me dice que es al mes 😱 le pregunté es una póliza o me van a vender otro carro, una vez más otra mentira que el precio será bajo parece que las calificaciones son de los mismo o familiares de lo que trabajan ahí es la primera vez que me dicen que un seguro de carro por mes $440<//Review>< pics>

Horrible experience, avoid this place. The first truck I was rented did not start, so I waited a significant amount of time while they pulled another truck around. I was not printed a new contract confirming the new truck.

Long story short the truck had many more miles on it than recorded and I have been charged $360 above what I should have been charged. I was charged for 280 miles that I didn't drive. I stood in line for 45 mins during my return to make sure that all was good, but it wasn't and the manager said I was good to go.

I have already reached out to support to no avail and have been waiting 2 days for an email from the GM. In that time, the charge has been posted to my statement.

On top of all of this, I spent a total of 2 hours at the uhaul location during a 24 hour truck rental, they are understaffed and provide poor customer service. The parking lot is a mess and nearly impossible to pull out of. This store should not be open.<//review>

<text>Walter helped a lot when I returned a 10' truck I'd driven from Monterey Calif., Once I got passed his gruff demeanor initially he was sweet, personable and helpful. Ya just gotta get past the first layer. Also the woman, Dareus, Darrel, Darnell. ..something... was good too.<//text><UserId.>110445207667173123768<//UserId.>< response>

<Response>None</Response><Rating>5<//Rating><UserId.>116916219343834245103<//UserId.><text>10 stars, if it were possible. Tony is an amazing employee and person. Tony helped my friend, RH, who was moving to TX this morning.  My friend had reserved a trailer that attaches to a hitch and there were some issues, that were unpredictable, with the weight of the trailer vs the size/weight of the SUV. My friend was already a bit stressed about the 20 hr drive ahead of him, and this unforeseen situation was very overwhelming for my friend to fathom. Clearly, Tony could tell that this combination that my friend had chosen was not going to work for the long drive that my friend had ahead. Tony went above and beyond to help my friend get the truck and trailer that was needed for his adventure and did it without hesitation and very promptly. The compassion and personality that this employee, Tony, has to help people, is the type of customer service that every company would beg for. Tony has been with the company for about 35 years. Uhaul should be so very proud of Tony's time served, customer service, loyalty, determination and dedication for, not only the company, but for the customers and taking such great care of them!!  A smile goes a long way, but the great kindness that Tony showed today, obviously goes a whole lot further ...1,437.9 miles worth, to be exact! Thank you for being the guardian angel on Earth that you are, Tony!

Very greatful,

A loving friend of RH (who is greatful that my friend will safely get to his next big adventure in life)<//text>< Date>

Trust me avoid this Uhaul franchise
1. Dirty trucks
2. Rude management
3. Gang members fighting on property with no security
4. Poor quality trucks burn gas and extra mileage is utilized
5. Yard is crammed full and looks like a junk yard</text>

Tony is a fabulous manager that quickly and expediently helped us rent a truck. The truck also worked well throughout the day. We would have given the place 5 stars would it not have been for the rudeness received from Eric on our return. Nothing beats a bit of friendliness after a day of moving.< /text>

<Text>In my 35 years in Santa Monica I've used U-Haul on Lincoln several times, most recently for boxes as I pack to move out of state. This U-Haul is very well located next to the Interstate 10 freeway on ramp. But in addition, they have the best employees!  Walter Perez and Catrice Ingram have both helped me several times. People are pretty stressed when they're moving, even more so during the pandemic, so it's a pleasure to work with calm, helpful, friendly employees. They know the business and they know how to work with people. I am so grateful.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Go to Peske.
Go to Budget.
Never rent here or trust the employees or manager of this facility. I rented at U-Hall many times before. Their service is going down fast. I rented a trailer for two days before closing and wanted to know if I can keep it for a 3d day. Called 9 times and couldn't connect with this location. All calls go to customer service. Spoke to customer service and they suggested I go to the location and ask! I used the trailer in Simi Valley and I live in long Beach. It's such a hastle to leave work or don't go home just to battle traffic on the 405 to ask a dumb question. When I showed up 40 minutes past the time to return, I was charged for an additional day+insurance (of course).
I argued that if I would be charged, and while trailer is still connected, that I keep it for one more day. They said no because it was reserved for the next day!!
I accused them of fraud and they laughed it off!!!
Tried to have my bank block the fraud and I couldn't because the charges were pending. The only reason I called 9 times, was hang up on, was told that the calls were re-routed to custom service, etc.. is to save myself a trip to the location. It seems that U-Haull resorts to this tactic to prevent you from getting straight answers and be scammed!! If I knew I was gonna get charged, and that they would not extend the costumary grace period, I would have just used it for a 3d day.
I would never set foot at this location and I would consider another business all together.
The rip off at U-Hall is the beginning of their downfall.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

I was just calling to confirm my appointment and the gentlemen who picked up the phone was extremely rude. Anything I asked he just kept repeating 1800 go uhaul. I understand that was the number I need to call but you could be a little bit more professional about it.</review>

<review>I have moved 4 times in my life and I have NEVER received customer service from this company as I did yesterday. Even before I picked up my truck, I received a courtesy call from the manager, Mr. Tony to confirm everything was ok. The staff was so friendly and comical. I felt like I was at a comedy club. Should I ever move again I will only come back to this location and recommend to friends and family! If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>I had a pretty horrible experience with this location.  Firstly, there was some good to be had with the company itself.  The truck was almost new and therefore in good condition.  After the use of the truck, I had a billing issue which took a few calls to customer service; all of those people were enthusiastic, helpful and polite.  Return to a local drop off spot was super easy and staffed by a nice guy.  I kept my part of the deal with gas, etc., so no unexpected charges afterwards.

But my experience at this location was enormously off-putting.  The man who assumed responsibility for helping me was enormously rude.  I'm waiting to speak to someone at a desk when I hear this guy standing 20 feet behind me ask "what do you need?"  There were no lights on this day because of an electrical blackout on the block, so I couldn't see his eyes.  Given that I was next to another person waiting and that he did not address anyone (sir, ma'am, or even a "hey, you"), I asked to whom he was speaking.  He tells me, and this is word for word, "I'm talking to you.  Come here.  If I'm going to talk to you I need you here, not standing over there."  This in the most arrogant tone imaginable.  I felt like I was getting stopped by the police.  Unbelievable.

Sadly, I had to deal with this member of society's finest through the whole process, trying my best to suppress my anger.  To top it off, he shorted me on the moving blankets I had reserved and paid for, the charges of which customer service took care of with no hassle.

To top it off, they have employees that smoke on a bench next to the entrance door.  This in Santa Monica, CA where it is illegal to smoke on a public sidewalk anywhere near a business.  I literally had walk through cigarette smoke to enter the business.

Next time, I'm biting the bullet and paying the extra money for Penske.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2bb75158f0d15:0x6cfdb1d1bbc68578<//gmapID></record>

<text>U-Haul is awesome all I needed  was to rent a truck open bed to move to dining table and chairs bought some rope there to tie down for $3.50, the truck rental total with insurance with was $88. 19, a little pricey for 3 hours, the gas was $10. 47.
I plan on moving from Santa Monica, California to Colorado Springs, Colorado and it was less expensive to have professional movers come and pick up the boxes and the furniture then to rent a U-Haul truck and drive including towing my vehicle behind it. The price I was quoted was $1, 595 and that included the trailer for my vehicle behind it, but does not include gas or insurance! The professional movers quoted me a price to load the boxes and move them and deliver them between $1, 141 and $1, 395, depending on weight of the load.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><time>1539401191587</time><Resp>None</Resp><username>Dr. Jamie Marie Davis</username></record>

This place is great...I rent trucks here regularly for moving jobs I do as an independent contractor.

Judy is amazing...kind and professional...I had a situation arise and Judy handled it professionally.

Whenever I have a moving job near Santa Monica this is where I go...the staff go out of their way to ensure the place is clean inside and out.

I go here with confidence...and leave satisfied. Thanks ya all!

Normally I don't like leaving a bad review, just good ones, but the service I got from the front desk employee, Catrice Ingram was the worst service I've had anywhere. I've worked in different parts of the service industry and I can definitely say I've had customers who were confused about prices like I was when I came to rent a truck. I'll tell you what though, I never raised my voice at them or talked down to them like she did. Not only did she do these things, but she also asked me to go to the back of the line when I confronted her about her bad attitude. She of course regretted her decision towards the end of our encounter when her tone changed, but this was after explaining to her that it's an employees job to help customers when them have questions rather than talking down to them.< /Text>

Nice U-Haul business. But be advised that you have to play for the truck, the mileage acquired, and the gas before, and upon return.</text>

My first time here was a terrible experience. The service was poor enough that I left more frustrated than I arrived. I came again later and had a bit of a better time, but its likely I won't be going again.< /Text>

<text>This place is remarkably horrific. Not a single person who works here has any concern for doing their jobs. Do literally anything else if you can. The owner, Tony Waters, was mocking a frustrated customer who’s rate was not properly explained to her, and who was being overcharged by $100.

He doesn’t care about customer service.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c2bb75158f0d15:0x6cfdb1d1bbc68578<//gmapID></record>

<Review>Staff was friendly and professional.
The cargo van I rented has rubber traction flooring in the cargo area which prevents the desk I was hauling from sliding around while the van was in motion during use.
I am very impressed with everything U-Haul provided. I am customer for life with this U-Haul location and with the general manager, Tony Waters.

Thank you very much!!!

<review>Usually i dont write a review but because the first time i was there i left the place frustrated. Today the big bald empolyee sitting at the first desk next to the door was so disrespectful. We wanted to reserve a truck for a later day, he refused to help us instead he told me to call and make a reservation by phone with a bad attitude like he’s the owner of the truck or something. Overall customer service was awful.< /review>< pictures>

They we're timley but did not rush, they took care of each person like they were the only one in the store. I understand this is one of the busiest U-Haul stores and it's small.

<text>2019-09-13 update:
I came here again. The employees do not work very quickly, as far as I can tell. They make casual chit chat while there are customers waiting. They don't seem very motivated to do a good job. The line was long and went slower than it needed to. Not impressed. When I picked up the truck, I had to wait for them to re-install one of the side mirrors. Not sure why it was off...

Original post:
The service was decently quick but one of the employees was speaking with her friend on the phone right in front of me. She also was a bit confused about exactly what I had ordered, which made it seem like she didn't know how to use the computer system well.</text>< Pictures>

<text>Ever seen the Seinfeld episode with the rental car? That's this Uhaul. I made a reservation for 11am. I got a call at 10:53am saying they didn't have what I reserved. I could wait until 1:30pm for that vehicle for half the time, or I could drive another 15 miles and wait for one to be returned to another location.

I opted for the 1:30pm for half the time, and it was set. I arrived to a store full of angry customers waiting. I checked in and was told that I was behind someone else who was there "way before you, so just hold on for your turn." I wasn't frustrated until that point.

"What's the point of the reservation if you don't reserve it and hold it?" - Paraphrasing Seinfeld.

Really...what is the point?

The days of car rental places need to be numbered. I should have spent $25 more for Turo. At least the vehicle would have been there when I arrived.<//text><Resp>None</Resp>< Rating>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Quick and inexpensive.  The service was almost immediate and they didn't try to upsell you on what makes the most money:  boxes and supplies.  When I checked in, the service was just as fast.

An interesting point is that I noted one of the tires was worn, so I called them.  They said to call the Roadside service, but it didn't look bad enough with the 5 miles that I was about to do.  But the gentleman on the phone took all the details, and they were going to look into it when I brought it back.

I would definitely rent from them again.</review>< Pics>

I cannot say enough of how well I was treated. Mr. Waters, the General Manager, who handled my transaction is professional, courteous and a problem solver!!  I don't expect to need services in the future in the L.A. area; but, if I did, I would go out of my way and return to this just to be treated like that again!  Than you Mr. Waters!</Text>

They did end up getting me in a vehicle, but wow what a bad unorganized experience. Made reservation online a week ahead and called 2 days before to verify they would have the bigger truck 1 way for me. Go figure go in to pick up, and oh no we dont have it, and btw we only have the smallest truck right now but we comp you a trailer and make it come out less, and btw it's only a local vehicle so it has to be returned here. Manager got involved and gave me a "discount". Huge inconvienance now I have a trailer to hitch and hitch when loading and parking ect... then worst part. I returned the vehicle and they charged me per mile which came out almost 100 more than my original reservation, and of course manager was off day I returned it. Called for the next 4 following days. Could never get in touch, never got a call back, call end corporate and was told everything on my contract appeared normal, and they didnt acknowledge the lead up to the end result which was their employees bad management and buisness skills. Whole thing left a very bad feeling of the situation<//review>

First Uhaul gave me an incorrect drop of location, then I spent over an hour on the phone in rush hour traffic with a huge truck trying to get the correct info and was directed here, by that time I was maybe 2hrs late - due to uhaul. I told the manager the situation, she RUDELY dismissed me out of hand. I called uhaul customer service and was told the senior manager was in a meeting and I would have to wait, an hour or more. After wasting hours already, and being late to my meeting, no thanks. Got charged 42x and had MY TIME WASTED. The manager I spoke to could have helped me, but she didn’t even listen to me. I’ve used uhaul since high school - I’m 60… solid customer. I will NEVER go back to this location. Perhaps it’s time for someone else to enter this market…<//Text>

<text>Watch out! They lock the lot and you can not drop off here after hours and as I was not informed of this, I got a $53 ticket for parking on the street. No body at U-haul told me about this problem and they refused to pay the ticket. Won't rent from U-haul again!!!<//text>< date>

< Review>
This is the best UHaul location on the West Side, hands down. I've had to rent a UHaul more than once in LA over the last few years and have gone to a few different places now. This time, I went out of my way to rent from these guys because the difference in customer service is night and day. I wasn't disappointed, and they even let me off the hook on a few things they definitely could have hit me with a fee for.

The folks who work there are super relaxed, know their craft well, and work well within their team to get you in, registered, out to the lot, and out the gate. Literally everyone who works there is cool, and it's always a pleasure rather than a horror story to rent from these guys.

Biggest thumbs up I can give. I highly recommend going out of your way on moving day to simplify things and work with these folks.</Review>

Worst experience ever.  Arrived here at 9:20am and it's now 10:31am. Uhaul can't find the truck my buddy has a reservation for.  Nothing else is available and we're waiting for an answer as to where the original truck is. When we arrived, there were 15 people in line and only 2 employees working the counter. We're now at the point of getting 2 7ft trucks.<//Text>

The rates were so low! It was only $19 a day. Plus I had unforeseen rental agreements due to not knowing where to put my trailer. They waved all fees.  Can not believe how awesome the Customer Service is at this location.</Review>< Pics>

I called customer service and they said they would refund me, but instead I have been receiving invoices every day for a van that I never even drove. Such a horrific experience. I an't get a hold of customer service so now the charges are all the way up to $350 with no way to resolve this mistake on their end.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Staff can be friendly or just meh... Lots of variability. Then again this place turns out lots of rental business and the clientele can be tough to please, so I'm sure it's not the easiest location to serve with a smile.</text>

Didn't get their names but the guys at the desk are legends. I haven't even picked up the truck yet but needed to switch day right after I left office and he fixed it in 30 seconds. Only issue is he's a Yankee fan and I'm a Red Sox fan.<//Review>

very unprofesional -  when I called the person attended to a customer without telling to hold or please wait - held on to hear their conversation

when I got there the staff had attitude problem - like they are doing us a service

when returning the truck  - was yelled at that we almost closed even though there was 5 minutes till closing

staff needs to be trained in customer service

may not rent from there

been a long time renter from uhaul -

<text>I had my first experience at Dozzy's the other day. I ordered a Churro, Mangoniada and a Tama-Rico. All three products were delicious, I'm particularly very picky with my Churros since many people make them dry but these were crispy and moist on the inside. Definitely would recommend if your looking for Mexican treats/snacks.<//text>< pics>

<Text>Don't pay attention to any of the ratings less than 5.
Yes, it can take a minute to get your food, this isn't a chain and I've only ever seen one person working.  Also, due to the fact that this is a small place,they aren't open every  day that's mentioned online or on the sign. Because the food is good, sometimes they run out of certain items.  (Small business probs.)
Anyways, the food is awesome, so goooo!</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Well my daughter walked in n the lady told her i needed to move my car n my daughter told her i was but the lady told her she needs to move it now we already had a accident. I was already pulling away when my daughter started walking out so i stopped. My daughter told me what the lady said and how she didnt want to go back in because she was so rude. So we just drove off. I will never go back!<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Dispatcher said "don't be late for your appointment and don't piss them off or you can plan on a 7 hour wait for your paperwork." I'm always early by 3 or 4 hours and usually get a door 30 minutes after I arrive. Paperwork in 2 to 3 hours.< /Review><gmapID>0x8085786f556d4693:0x8d607d528bd961ab<//gmapID><user_name>GL Hogue</user_name>< Time>

Terrible warehouse, they has no respect for their customers and they think they are the only warehouse in the area :/ Rude employees who are not willing to help, expensive rates as they will charges you for a whole month storage even though you store your product only for one day. Very difficult to get things in and out and they will charge you for everything. The owner John Swinnerton is dumb ass racist jerk who has no class.
I hope he bruns with this place!   This place is doomed anyways, it used to belong to safeway and they close it after a fire.</text>

<Review>I got to say I was rob of $3500. I was charge $3500 to file 2 year worth of taxes and to put me on a 2 year non-collectable status. Seriously! When I called this people I was already on a payment plan something I did for free. I called because their advertisement said they can help me settle with the IRS if I owe more than 10k. From the beginning I disclosed my assets and not once I was told "Hey there is a possibility that your assets might be a problem". No I was told "we can help you settle if you pay us $3500". Now I get a letter basically a slep in my face telling me they are done with my case. They put me on a 2 year noncollection plan for $3500. I called to express my dissatisfaction and I am told that I have to take in consideration the time and the first page of the contract says not everyone can't be offered a settlement. So the moral of the story if you can settle with the IRS yourself do it unless you have money to just give away. This people are taking advantage of people who are seeking for help.I gave them 1 start because they did helpe file 2 years of back taxes for $3500 so thank you for that.< /Review><Date>1616087098584</Date>< pics>

< review>
2 years ago I was hassled around by Optima tax relief firm they took my retainer fee and wouldn’t work until he got the remainder of the balance after I asked for refund he ignored all my calls

so I end up researching and found the tax defense group.. At first I was very skeptical but as soon as I talked to Matt Sitler my guard went down, he’s very professional,kind and patient, he helped me so much I couldn’t ask for a better tax Lawyer, he lifted my bank levy, tax liens, and garnishment from work and he worked very hard for 1 yr + to settle with the IRS, 2 years later I have referred him to 2 of my friends and they are getting taken care off just like how they took care of me. Ask for Matt Sitler he will go above and beyond for you.

Thank you  Matt, Arianna, and The Tax Defense Group for all your help

The Tax Defense Group helped us so much!!  They got our tax debt down from almost $40k to less than $2k.   Their work is well worth the cost you have to pay for such excellent results.  You will not regret using this business.  I held back for years from facing this staggering debt but they made it easy for me.  Thank you so much Tax Defense Group!!!   Lisa H, Knoxville, TN</Text>

<review>I've known about this company for a few years now, through the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce, but thankfully not had a reason to call until just this year.  My husband and I found ourselves in a tax pickle, and I knew who I needed to call first.  I am so grateful that I did!  They immediately went to work, once we got them the information they needed and began communicating with the IRS and the state on our behalf.  Whatever the outcome, whether its a payment plan, negotiated offer in compromise, etc. I feel such a weight lifted that we have professionals managing it all.  Thank you Tax Defense Group!!  I am having my taxes prepared by you guys from this point forward!!< /review></record>

<date>1564804016572< /date><text>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME, OR ENERGY!! We paid them to dispute money owed to the IRS, it took them 8 months to notify the IRS that we had representation. In the year of dealing with them, our case manager has changed THREE times and our latest guy, I’m convinced, doesn’t exist. As a part of signing up, they did our 2018 taxes and showed us owing $27,690 (in addition to what we already owed)!! We decided to find someone else, local. He redid our 2018 taxes finding too many errors to count!! We went from owing $27,690 to getting $1300 back! I believe this place is a scam and the positive reviews were written by them!< /text>< UserId.>

<Review>At 1st I thought this company was just like every other company a scam. So when my husband came to me he said I think I found a company that can help me resolve my tax problems I told him to give me the name and I'll do the research. So as I begin to do my research I told him yes I liked the reviews I had seen compared to the other companies. It was hard paying your every month bill's  on top of that paying IRS looking like the amount was never going down because,  of the  Interests and other  fees they keep charging  We decided to go with Tax Defense when Albert call and told my husband all what he need well it didn't get done so I told Albert to talk only with me beause, my husband is a person who doesn't like dealing with important issues so I got all the info they needed made sure my husband signed the paperwork we put in a offer to IRS they let us know within 6 months if they will except his offer. Thank you Jesus they did  my husband's  had $26,000 lien against him from IRS but Tax Defense did just what they said they would do  resolved your tax problem</Review>< GmapID>

sharing the Review with millions should be the way to express how we feel about the staff in SImi Valley.  Matt Sittler,  George Rodriguez, Leroy G have made the process very easy ! Our family saved thousands of dollars and we couldn't be happier with the outcome.

Again Thank you to The Tax Defense Group if you ever need assistance

The experts at the Tax Defense Group helped file all my returns, and make the proper arrangements on my significant balances that I owed. They were able to knock my bill down in half! I wish I would have known about the Tax Defense Group years ago as I was dreading having to face this issue. Highly reccommend using this company if you need help getting caught up and doing things the right way! The Tax Defense Group not only fixed my matter, but they have a plan set up to file my taxes for the rest of my life to ensure I never get into a mess like this again.< /Text>< pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>My federal income tax debt was over $14K. I was worried about what might happen and I had heard of The Tax Defense Group on tv. I read some reviews but was still skeptical. I finally called and was able to talk to someone who took my basic information and told me what he thought his group could do. He told me the fee and gaurenteed that there would be no more charges.
During the course I spoke with several representatives and faxed several documents that they asked for. I did everything they asked and was still a little skeptical.
Long story short - I received a letter from the IRS saying that they  accepted my offer and this was verified by The Tax Defense Group.
My tax debt of over $14K was reduced to $898.00.
I trust and highly recommend this group. Thank you!!!< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
The mere fact that Bob Eubanks trusts them gave me a sense of relief. I am one of the people who hired another company before the Tax Defense Group and it didn't work out well at all.  I called and spoke with Carlos and he was great on the phone. He put me on hold to talk to the Enrolled Agent and found that I could benefit by using them and he would certify that in writing. I was scared but I felt like I still had to trust them. I used my credit card just in case there was an issue I could alert my card company ! ( my son told that is smart ).

The case was placed in a collections hold so based on the financial state after my husbands death.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart.<//Review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>HIring a company to resolve an issue that is this serious was extremely daunting. I am a single mother and couldn't afford to have any garnishment take place. I missed filing tax returns due to a divorce and then my ex husband claimed our children when i was designated to do so. I called after seeing Bob Eubanks on a TV commercial. When i did call the person immediately seemed to have the knowledge and asked all the right questions.  I feel so much better now that it's being taken care of.
After the taxes are filed i can establish an agreement based on my financial position.

Thank you to everyone at the office.....<//Text>< GmapID>

Living on SS only, there was no way I could pay them . So I called at 9 am my time ,not knowing they were in Ca. and it was 6 am .A gentleman answered said he was getting ready to go in the office but asked me what my problem was..Not call me at the office later. Instead he listened ,said he could get rid of my debt, gave me his cell number to  call him when I was ready to start. Found out later he was not there anymore and then I got AMY , my girl took over and got the job done. Thanks to The Tax Defense Group my debt is all gone.< /Review>< date>

<review>Wow, where to begin! Long story short, I found out my wife of over 30 years was having an affair. This led to us getting divorced, where she took my house and we were forced to split the large amount of money I had saved up in my retirement. By withdrawing this, I assumed a large tax debt and was unable to pay in full last year when I filed. Nervous about owing the Feds, and hearing stories of people who have owed them $40,000 like I did, I contacted the Tax Defense Group. These folks were on it from the very first time I reached out to them until they had negotiated a resolution with the IRS. It wasn't easy, but they were there with me every step of the way. I was able to fix my problem without facing collections and now I have a plan in writing that I can follow through with. If you have a debt with the IRS then I would definitely give them a call!<//review>< gmap_id>

But I saw bob Eubanks on tv and gave the tax defense group a call. I spoke with George who treated me like family and I got a reasonable price for their services. The tax defense group helped me out so much with my debt!! Incredible. Highly recommend using them

After several threats from the IRS, I finally looked for professional help as I knew their calculations claiming I owed them over $60,000 were wrong.  I called TTDG and they took my case.  I was just hoping that I could get the amount cut down.  Was I ever surprised when we got a refund check for over $14,000.  Thank you a thousand time to The Tax Defense Group.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The worst company, we started in April 2019 to help us make a payment arrangement with the IRS, and they never did anything, the only thing they did was charge us $ 3,900 usd, you call them and they never answer and when they answer they never say anything why not They do nothing, when we unilaterally terminated the contract (Oct 2020) the only thing they did was tell the IRS that we had no intention of paying for a garnishment order to be placed on us. When our intention has always been to put ourselves to peace and safety.

The least professional company I have ever met, the most inefficient people.

We lost the deposit of a house ($ 5,000 usd) because we never reached a payment plan with them, they said that the process lasted more or less 3 months and with us they lasted 18 months and they never finished.

La peor compañía, empezamos en Abril 2019 para que nos ayudaran a hacer un arreglo de pagos con el IRS, y nunca hicieron nada, lo único que hicieron fue cobrarnos $3.900 usd, uno los llama y nunca contestan y cuando responden nunca dicen nada porque no hacen nada, cuando terminamos el contrato unilateralmente (Oct 2020) loúnico que hicieron fue decir al IRS que nosotros no teníamos intención de pagar para que nos pusieran una orden de embargo. Cuando la intención de nosotros siempre ha sido ponernos a paz y salvo.

La compañía menos profesional que he conocido, las personas más ineficientes.

Perdimos el depósito de una casa ($5.000 usd) porque nunca logramos con ellos un plan de pagos, ellos decían que el proceso duraba más o menos 3 meses y con nosotros duraron 18 meses y nunca terminaron.</text>

(Translated by Google) The worst job and the worst quality we will find here if you are willing to be treated badly and only charge you contact this group

And JORGE RODRIGUEZ does the worst job to him if they gave him the title zero professionalism, a Bulgarian person and lack of respect and that man charged us and we had to put up with a drunk day laughing and saying that he was not going to help us anymore when he was already He had charged us, he kept the 3,000 dollars to start the case and in the end he did not help us at all.

<review>(Translated by Google) A year ago I hired a lawyer from this company who claims to help people with their problems with the IRS, and I let them know who is going through such an unpleasant moment, that please do not hire any of this office, if they want to their situation is resolved, I really advise them, to start when they need you to pay them, they call you every day, including Sundays, but if it is to give you information about your case, they will never do it, they extend the process until they no longer They can do more, to finally tell you that they feel that you have to resolve directly with the IRS, the lawyers, they do not take the seriousness or the desire to fix your problem, as it should be, that without forgetting that on one occasion call Mr. Jorge Rodríguez one Saturday in the middle of a desperate moment, in which the IRS sent us a letter of which we wanted and we need explanations, they treated us in the most horrible way that a human being can treat, they made fun of me and me husband, he laughed in our face In short, they are the worst that they may have graduated as a professional, that man who claims to be a lawyer, in my opinion of the legal profession he does not know much, and to treat others he knows less. I hope my experience will be of use to those who are going through this, as I have since day one that this process began, it has been long, stormy, unpleasant and to complete the deception of this company.

Hace un año contraté un abogado de esta compañía q dice ayudar a las personas con sus problemas con el IRS, y les dejo saber a quien esté pasando por tan desagradable momento, q por favor no los contrate a ninguno de esta oficina, si quieren q su situación se resuelva, en verdad les aconsejo, para empezar cuando necesitan q les pagues, te llaman todos los días, incluyendo los domingos, pero si es para darte información sobre tu caso, jamás lo harán, te extienden el proceso hasta q ya no pueden más, para al final decirte q lo sienten q tienes q resolver directamente con el IRS, los abogados , no se toman la seriedad ni el deseo de arreglar tu problema, como debe ser, eso sin dejar de mencionar q en una ocacion llame al señor Jorge Rodríguez un sábado en medio de una desesperado momento, en q el IRS nos envió una carta de la cual queríamos y necesitamos explicaciones, nos trató de la forma más horrible q se puede tratar un ser humano, se burló de mi y de mi esposo, se rio en nuestra cara, en fin son lo peor q pueden haber graduado como profesional,ese hombre q dice ser abogado, en mi opinión de abogacía no conoce mucho, y para tratar a los demás conoce menos. Espero mi experiencia le sirva de algo a quien esté pasando por esto q al igual q yo desde el día uno q comenzó este proceso ha sido largo, tormentoso, desagradable y para completar el engaño de esta compañía.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

(Translated by Google) CAUTION ................. My experience with this firm that claims to be specialized lawyers with tax issues was of very poor quality in terms of management, attention and efficiency, from which I was scammed When requesting the refund of my money, they never responded, they never responded to the messages and if I was very harmed because due to all this I was forced to hire another law firm, entering an additional expense that is, more money, more time , more fines and clearly a lot more stress. Be very careful because this firm to ask for the money is very efficient but to solve there they never respond

(Original)
CUIDADO.................Mi experiencia con esta firma que dicen ser abogados especializados con los temas de impuestos fue de muy mala calidad en cuanto a gestión atención y eficacia de la cual resulte estafado, al solicitar la devolución de mi dinero nunca dieron respuesta nunca responden a los mensajes y si me vi muy perjudicado porque debido a todo esto me vi en la obligación de contratar otra firma de abogados entrando en un gasto adicional es decir más dinero, más tiempo, más multas y claramente mucho más estrés. Tengan mucho cuidado porque esta firma para pedir el dinero son muy eficientes pero para resolver ahí nunca responden</Text>

He always answered our phone calls and emails and took the time to answer all our questions and in Spanish. Thanks to him and the whole team!

Horrible management. The casino is not even packed and the wait has been over an hour to even get to the ordering area. The employees have no care in the world to hustle and get orders done out and quick, slowly rolling burritos and talking among each other. Apparently they stop making customer orders that have been waiting in like for over  hours to make the orders for the high roller customers. This system is ridiculous. The casino is loosing money this way. If you don't have two hours to wait and eat, your better off stopping at a Chipotle before arriving at the casino. Not recommended.<//Text>

<text>Always do enjoy coming here to Chingon to enjoy some quality Mexican food. However although today is the 4th of July, the service was busier than usual. My mom and I eat here every week only to encounter an unusual experience with the corn tortillas. Last Thursday and every Thursday that we would come the corn tortillas would never be burnt. Today after exchanging a tortilla, the second one was still burnt as shown in the picture. On busy holidays, the staff should pay more attention to each of the entrees being cooked to avoid unusual quality blunders like today.<//text>< Pictures>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Went last night to San Manuel Casino location. Not a good experience, tortilla was still raw dough and beans were hard and rice was mush. This was nothing to brag about or to be liable as chingon, no mames, this shouldn’t be associated with George Lopez. I have eaten tacos with carne de perro from a sketchy taco cart coming out from drink and drown in Juarez that tasted way better than this gringofied mess. Loved the decoration though.</text>< Gmap_id>

<text>This place is so yummy! We have come here twice already (we have only been to this casino twice). Their tortillas are fresh and made in front of you. The menudo is very yummy, I only hoped I was able to put more hominy. We enjoyed how fresh their food taste and that it is made to order. You do have to wait in line for at least 30 minutes or more but if you don't want to wait they take orders over the phone. The first time we came here, they seemed understaffed. But the second time around, they had at least 6 people helping out with the line and registers. The worker outside helping customers with cleaning up their finished meals is so helpful. Greg walks around clean up the tables while checking on other customers to see if they need anything else with their meals such as to-go supplies, taking our finished plates and keeping the area very tidy. The manager and supervisors seems great and really helps their staff with helping the line move faster. The staff (second time around- 10/19/19 qt 3:30 PM) that made our food seemed friendlier and happier. We look forward to coming back here.<//text>< Pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>My boyfriend and I had been wanting to try it because we heard it was good and we also heard that it wasn’t good. Well I didn’t even want to give it this star but it wouldn’t let me comment. The customer service was bad our tacos were cold they got our order wrong and then the girl that took the order wanted my boyfriend to take over the bag our food was in as if she didn’t believe him we already had our food out getting ready to eat it was bad enough we had to finish putting all the garnishes on our food. The taquitos were burnt and this was over priced. The side of rice and beans looked like something most restaurants give as samples and the menu got cut to 3 items. The Decor was nice. I will not go back. El pollo loco is better and cheaper. Save your money and time.... 👎🏼< /Review>< pics>

Wow in the beginning it was great
Good food and employees were very nice
I know changes have been force but quality service usually goes with good food
Your food has change and service is very rude like if they are doing you a favor or samething.

<review>This place is similar to Chipotle's in the way the food is prepared and served but the food is more Mexican street food style which includes homemade horchata and the Mexican" style corn on the cob so soft with a lot of flavor.

Perhaps first and last time I visit this restaurant, I had a bad experience, I order two tacos they told me they would send me a text when my food was ready and that never happened. I ended up getting cold food because my order was ready for a while but I wasn’t notified via text like they promised</Review>

Where do I even start?? Okay well the decor inside is stunning and I LOVE how I can see them making the tortillas right there on the spot!! Even though I am a Latina I am very picky with my Mexican food. With the being said I never liked burritos till I can here. I got a carne asada burrito and OMG it was SO good!!! I've been craving a burrito ever since and every time I get a burrito from somewhere else it never compares to the one here!! The chips are also delicious and my mom LOVES the bake potato!! I can't wait to go back to get me another burrito!!<//Text>

They got my order wrong, so it took 2 hours to get my food, because I had to get in line 3 times just to ask for my food, and get my food. Anyhow, the carne asada doesn't have the great flavor it use to have, it was dry, no flavor, beans weren't the same, the rice was hard, in a small burrito, at a higher price. The only thing good was the tortilla. Also, there wasn't any habanero salsa anymore. The tacos weren't good either. Worst customer service I have had in a long time. I'll make sure I eat before coming into the casino.

The restaurant itself is very inviting and great atmosphere! It was my first time ever eating at a George Lopez restaurant and it was delicious! I got a chicken burrito with rice/beans and every condiment they had to offer and it was just off the hook! That fresh flour tortilla👌. The customer service was spot on as well from the friendly food makers and my cashier Luciano he was very helpful and polite. Will absolutely visit again when I'm at San Manuel.<//review>

<Text>George Lopez has it going on at this place,  went there for lunch with my honey and we didn't leave disappointed.
I ordered the bowl w/chicken and he ordered the Asada burrito (huge) both meats have lots of flavor. They also had Jamaica and Tamarind drinks so I took a little taste of both yummy...
One last good thing,  they have the good Ice but don't take my word go try this place for yourself.
Its the kind of place that makes you want to go back, George maybe you can give Trejo's a few tips.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1571499992187, 'text': 'Thank you for the five stars!

<rate>3< /rate><review>It’s good but not great. Think Chipotle. I got a burrito and the thing is large and has good flavor but the meat had a lot of fat mixed in. I had al pastor. I was also hoping for a margarita and they don’t serve anything until after 5. A bit more like fast food than expected. I was hoping it was more like a restaurant. Better off going to Tios Tacos.</review><gmapID>0x80c354f8885115fd:0x42c6fd42829f379e< /gmapID>< resp>

<Text>San Manuel Casino has a George Lopez's Chin... Inside their food is cooked fresh each day & is home made. You can see them making the Tortillas by hand which is unique in it's own way. I always eat there Chicken Burritos with everything included down to the sour cream. Yummy yummy good 🤗 so have a good night sleep tight. Good nite & God bless!< /Text>< rate>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I Loved the place. The food was awesome it was authentic Mexican cooking presented that way with pots and skillets just the way they do it at home. A + George for capturing the feel of home-cooked Mexican food. It's a fast-casual restaurant but the quality is superb just great flavors good cuts of meat quality liquor at the bar just in a class job George excellent! The only thing that I would suggest is have your servers be a little bit more engaged cuz I bet 85% of your customers are New to your setup, like myself I didn't know I could add beans and rice to my order for a dollar more each item. What's Mexican food without beans and rice? It's a plate of tacos. It takes a whole team gather together to embrace the idea and the concept that were selling here of home-cooked flavorful Mexican food rice beans cilantro lime You Name It We got it and you're going to love it! Get everybody behind that idea and you'll shoot right out of the Galaxy. I would have gave it more stars George but 5 was all they had.

It would be Awesome if you could host like maybe once a month so new comic talent. A way for new talent to give a 3 minute routine with possibly some veteran commentary afterwards<//review>< pictures>

I waited about 40 minutes in line just to find out they don't have the vegetable dish that is up in the menu, all the staff member did is add just more lettuce. If they are not carry that item take off the menu. I also think they take to long to take the orders. If they had another restaurant next them this wouldn't happen people would have a choice.</review>

<Review>Came in here to check out what this place was all about. Walked in and noticed it isnt a sit down restraunt but a Chipotle style set up. We waited in line for an hour and ordered 2 of the asada filled baked potatoes with the works and flour tortillas on the side. They are homemade. Which is great. Workers are slow, food is average. Nothing special going on here. An hour wait for Chipotle is what it boils down to. The live band in the bar area is the only highlight of this place.< /Review><name>ANTHONY GARCIA<//name>< gmap_id>

Once again, ALL of the additional ingredients were very fresh and extremely tasty.  This burrito was humongous, and I shared it with 3 others as part of my super.

Was there last Thursday 5/13/21, took me like over 30 minutes to order, the only thing I asked was for green salsa and they gave me 2 little cups 😡 for 7 carne asada burritos, 3 chicken burritos and 2 al pastor tacos, 126$, their Subway style prep doesn’t work for the load of person that attend and only one prep bar, next time I will just go to Tacos Joe on Highland for that size order because they are good but only if you order small meals.</text>

The service was horrible but the food was WORSE!!! Not one item in the intire order was hot or even close to warm there was 11 of us that order.  The girl begin the counter couldn't even get the beans of the spoon to put on the burritos n bowls we order thats how cold they were so she decides to add oil to mix them to try n get them of the spoon. Cold oil on cold beans dont go well trust me on this one!!! I order the 3 roll tacos wish they were premade very difficult to shew them tacos were so stale and cold! We were all so disappointed i gotta tell you this has been the WORSE!!! food experience by far at a restaurant.  Its a chame to call this mexican food im sorry but its not even close to what our mexican cuisine has to offer.< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
What started off to be a good experience turned in to a awfully disappointing one. My wife is disabled and we were immediately greeted and said we can go ahead and be seated and she would take our order....very accommodating. She went over the menu and gave us some time to decide...she took our order and then about 25 min later finally brought our food to the table. ( there were many patrons that had their orders within a few minutes ). We did inform her that we would be eating here...however our food was brought in a to go bag with the explanation they were out of trays...we had food missing and the rice was opened and all over the inside of the bag. It made us feel very unwelcomed. We asked for a refund as we were no longer going to eat there. The manager came over listened and apologized for the long wait and said it was because they were backed up in the kitchen....she offered us the refund and asked if we would like to keep the food....we declined and just took our refund....</Review>

<review>Good food but there was a 1 hour line to get food.  When we received our food, the foid became cold.  Reason for minus 1 star.

<Review>I really enjoyed being able to choose my ingrediants/toppings for my stuffed baked potato.  You choose your own toppings for anything you want.  Tacos, burritos etc..  It was very good, and i loved the home made tortillas.  Being in a casino there is a bit of a wait to get up to the ordering area, but well worth the wait.
I would definitly go there again if i'm at the casino.  I hope he opens one in Palmdale!</Review>< user_id>

<review>Fuddruckers has been my go to place since I was a kid. I always loved it. It's one of the only places I know that serves melted cheese as a dipping sauce. So I always get the chicken strips just like when I was a kid and dip it into that cheese. Man it's good.

This restaurant is a little small and they don't have any booths so be prepared to sit in soft padded chairs. It's not too small though but compared to the others it's a small location. The food is always good as to be expected. The arcade is also small with very few games but it's enough to keep the kids happy.

To those who have never came and don't know what to get I would recommend the hangover burger.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQveukOPV7OVgOjyNhhPa2XwiRgO8NX1zRfVdI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Really unique burger spot. They grill your burgers and you put your own toppings on it (i.e. tomatoes, onions, lettuce, ketchup, relish, etc.). They also have various options for protein like fish, chicken, turkey and lighter meals like salad entrees. It is not too far from Knotts Berry Farm which is cool. They have a few games inside kind of like Dave & Busters. Food is delicious and prepared well. Plenty of space for dinning in. Def worth consecutive visits.<//Review>< pics>

I recommend the hangover, its a 100% fresh beff patty, bacon strips, with an over easy egg on top, and the hand battered onion rings are so crispy! You also get to deck it out with whatever toppings and condiments you want that are available. The atmosphere is really cool to, its got a nice 1950's theme to it and the employees are super nice and helpful, even though the combo meal came out to be 17 dollars, every cent and dollar was definitely worth every single bite! Next time im in the Buena Park area i will be going back, and you should to!< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzEzEh1PRL_JfTzD2EnKx4a0mMImNBw8A1On3H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNADgOrUXTqkyKpkUM2WVYyNMqQT3dxrvaEik4X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

Absolutely great quality burger with the option to top it yourself from the top quality veggies stand.
I love the self service drinks and family style tables. Plenty of open space to enjoy gatherings or parties or cozy booths available just for two. Price is $$$ however Quality is #1.
Sweets counter also available for dessert which was fresh and 2 thumbs up given by my children. I will be enjoying a meal with my family here again very soon.<//Review>

This is not my kind of restaurant I would usually go on regular basis because it mostly burger place. I went few times because of class action gift cards. They have another location in Lake Forest. It's spacious and airy with interesting decor. / Marlin Monroe statue inside/. Clean. Napa valley salad was OK. But milk shake regular size looked small and was $5!</text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>Good food, a little pricey but the size and taste of the burgers are worth the price, meat burgers are grilled per customer i.e. well done, medium, rare. The ingredients you choose are nicely placed too not dirty or anything, but they do take a while to clean up tables which makes it hard to sit when it gets packed.<//review>< Pictures>

The food is pretty good but it is not as good as it use to be. The last few times we have been there our orders were not correct.  Nothing crazy but just inconvenient.  But the food is good.< /review>

Good burgers but a little on the higher end side. The build your own condiment bar is pretty cool! Not a bad place of your looking to just grab a burger with a friend or coworker  but a little pricey if you're taking the whole family.</Text>

Been a decade since I've had a Fuddruckers burger.  Definitely will eat at Fuddruckers more often.  Bbq burger had much flavor.
No one cooks a burger the way I like aside from myself.  I grill everything on charcoal on the rare occasions I am home.
The 1/2 lb. burger I had here today wasn't charcoal grilled, but cooked to perfection, "medium rare".  Just dripping with grease, seasoned just right, and probably the best burger I've had in quite awhile.
Thinking about taking a walk back over there right now from my hotel for another.

Great burgers, topping bar, and a good price.  5 star from this guy.</review>

< review>
The food is good.  In the past we have always went to Fuddruckers over Carl’s, or any other burger place. We would pay $23.00 for the larger burger which is Almost what you would spend at other burger places. I just went in and placed an order and for 2 burgers fries and reg drinks was $30.00. The soda machine had no options and the fries were cold and for that price you would think you would have been served a lot more fries.  Very disappointing now we will start going to 5 guys.</review>

Nice place
The food is delicious. I really like that they give you the burger and you put whatever you want on it on yourself.
Has a nice little area for kids.</Text>

<Review>We got the lunch special. $7.00 for burger, fries & drink.The burger comes on the bun and then you can add the mustard, mayo, bbq sauce, ketchup, cheese sauce and all the veggies you want. Lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions & picante. We like lots of veggies so it was great. Also have other things to eat and drink, plus desserts. We always eat here when we can they have good burgers! Staff Was friendly when we went and it was pretty clean.</Review>< Rating>

Always a fun experience here. Enough games for the kids but not too many. Good music. Love the build your own bars and fresh toppings. Always plenty of seating.

Wait times to order food can be a little slow, consider going before or after rush hours.

Food is made to order and above average, but nothing to write home about. Be careful ordering a buffalo burger, it's definitely NOT buffalo chicken in a bun, it's REAL buffalo meat!

We'll be back, overall fun experience.</review>

Honestly, I havent been here in a long time! It was just okay. My burger was tasteless! Not sure how that happens when you order a 1/3 lb burger with bacon and a fried egg! I expect my burgers to have delicious flavor, just like my steaks! On top of that the burger bun was huge!!!! The price to make it a combo is a bit overpriced! Very small portion of fries! Maybe healthier that way, but not worth it.</text>

More and more  burgers. Great place for the family and for young kids because of games. On the grill to order and you can pick whatever you want so this keeps everyone happy. Meat is good and fresh. We always order onion rings. Reasonable prices too.  Staff is friendly. They don't rush you out.</Text>

Always a good burger and usually no wait. Moderate pricing with specialty meats and very fresh condiments. Definitely a great place to go when visiting Cali or if you want a good burger you don't have to cook yourself.</review>

<review>The food was great. The location itself needs a renovation.

I really like the burgers and the shakes and fries are good too. They have an ice cream bar, those touchscreen soda machies, and even a little arcade.

Basically, you order your burger (beef, chicken, deer, buffalo, or fish--can't remember if fish was an option), they give you a buzzer that goes off when your food is ready, you pick up your food, take it to the condiments bar to add your choice of lettuces, tomato, onions, ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, etc.<//review><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dd2bea49624ac5:0x4165ec6597791444< /gmapID>< pics>

The burgers had very little flavor, previously frozen patties, the buns are good, just wish they would be able to hold up to the meet, but, if you don't mind a Soggy Bottom bun, go ahead. Unfortunately, this will be the last time we go to Fuddruckers. We looked forward to coming here every time we came to California, but the price rising and lack of flavor, has definitely ruined it for us. We will not be back.

<Review>Stopped by here with my wife and her sister on the way to the Long Beach airport.  Both of the girls ordered their burgers medium well and I ordered mine well done specifically telling her no pink.  When we get our burgers mine is rare and the girls burgers were well done.

I went up front and asked for the manager.  I explained to her the situation but told her that I was going to eat it anyway because we were really tight on time because of a flight.  She was adamant about making another one and it would only take a few minutes.  I was ok with it as long as it was really quick and I went on to tell her what kind of burger it was just in case.

Fifteen minutes went by so I decided to go up and see what was going on.  She said the burger was almost finished.  I waited there and she finally gave me the burger which wasn't even the right one.  So after all of that I had to wait even longer for the right burger.  This was the manager I was dealing with and she had no clue how to handle this properly.

Once I got the food it was good but the whole situation was ridiculous.  That manager shouldn't be there.  I won't be going back there ever again.<//Review><rating>1<//rating><user_id>110581213894131225381< /user_id><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmap_id>

Best hamburger joint I've experienced.  Leaves 5 guys in the dust, better than fatburgers, and is on par with in-n-out but we can scoop our own toppings and the burgers are huge.  Buns taste great.  Also has a bakery.<//Review>

<Text>We absolutely love Fuddruckers, so much so that we eat here on 3 connective nights, whilst on the final 3 night of our holiday. The food is fantastic, reasonably priced, great value for money, and probably the best burgers you'll ever have. The staff are welcoming and the atmosphere is friendly.
We discovered Fuddruckers on our holiday the year before, we loved it then and simply had to come back again while on holiday this year.<//Text><gmapID>0x80dd2bea49624ac5:0x4165ec6597791444< /gmapID>< username>

< review>
Five stars all the way the lady in front was extremely helpful and polite it was my first time at a Fuddruckers and she helped me make a great choice. The grill man has amazing talent when it comes to food preparation. He timed the meat perfectly, super juicy with a high level flavor. Finally I got what I paid for. If anyone's ever in the area and you feel like treating yourself, Fuddruckers would be the best choice in Buena Park off Beach Boulevard< /review>

<text>Good old place been around for a while, the taste is fantastic, the atmosphere is great, a great burger place to fill your face. However; be ready to have a 2000 calorie meal with all the goodness comes a price, lots of incentive to hit the gym the next day, enjoy.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Best hamburger joint I've experienced.  Leaves 5 guys in the dust, better than fatburgers, and is on par with in-n-out but we can scoop our own toppings and the burgers are huge.  Buns taste great.  Also has a bakery.</Text>

The burger menu has choices that no other burger place offers--bison, elk, and American Kobi beef. Where else do you get these choices? The fries are excellent and there is plenty of seating choices for small to very large groups< /Text>

Took a bit longer than I would have liked to get my food. Condiments weren't particularly good when I went, but the food itself was really good. One of the better burgers I've tried, and the seasoned fries are great. A bit expensive though< /review>

<review>Came here for the first time was definitely impressed. The quality of the meat was amazing they cooked it to whatever style you like. I got mine medium well and it was delicious! The variety of the different types of burgers were awesome. They also have seasoned  potatoes wedges as their fries which I really liked and had the option to put nacho cheese and jalapeños on them and had nacho style fries. The staff was very friendly and the place was clean. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is because I heard they had the best white macidania cookies here and was super excited to try them but they got rid of that flavor and was disappointed. But other than that it was a great burger place</review>< rate>

However, not sure how staffing is going, but the young man who helped at the cashier not only got our order wrong (and we have severe food allergies), but he was ticking off others since he seemed to get almost everyone else's wrong also. The chef didn't look too pleased and had to remake most meals, and it made service take just that much longer. Not sure if I'll be back for a while.<//review>< Resp>

Definitely great food, bakery rocks but no entree worth getting is under 10 bucks. It's a 10 dollar deal no matter how you look at it. Plus they discontinued the world's best coffee so that costs them a star.<//review>

Excellent burgers great fries great service.

Update: this location has recently been remodeled and it looks like a cheap generic restaurant all of its old pictures have been removed all but the arcade and 2 old fashion gas pumps.  It was definitely a nicer visual experience before this remodel began.<//Review>

< Review>
Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time there were Fuddruckers all around, but slowly they began to disappear. Sometime in the early 90's, I believe this was the last one left in Southern California. Despite that, they still used their butcher shop and still baked treats in the bakery/ice cream spot. The brownies were very good. Sometime in the mid '00 this changed. There was a resurgence, Fuddruckers started coming back, they even started serving venison, buffalo and ostritch. I think this is where the problem started. They stopped baking cookies and sweets, and I don't know that they still use the butcher area for anything but storage.  At some point they reduced what they have on the menu and you have what they currently serve now.  It's not much, and it's only okay.
Yes, you get to make your burger your way with the veggies and condiments. And yes you can put on as much nacho cheese on your burger and potato wedges as you want, but I find myself only coming here for the cheese and potato wedges. Parking is okay, staff is average, food is average, selection is low. Don't come here if you have fond memories. If you want a burger with a ton of nacho cheese, this is your place.</Review>

I love Fuddruckers . I love the size of and the quality of the food,  it we ordered 3 burgers to- go
When we got home it was too late to go back and 2 of the 3 burgers were made wrong. Still if your around one, stop in and enjoy the real IHOB<//review>

Food was ok, not what everyone hyped it up to be. The ladies working both cashier and cook were very informative, patient, and had great attitudes as they waited for me to place my 7 orders haha and that was our 1st time there. Great atmosphere and love how they have it open to pick what you want to put on your burger!</text>

Great tasting burger. I purchased the manager's special which included a drink and French fries. Only complaint they use a 1/4 lb patty which fell apart mid way through eating the burger rather then the typical 1/3 patty.< /Review>

<Review>My 1st time here, and my experience was a complete disaster, I'm not going back. I ordered 2 Elk burgers with fries and drinks. After waiting 25 minutes for my order, I noticed they weren't really warm, almost as if they have been sitting in the open for a while.(not under the heat lamp). My mistake on not saying anything.

All the workers looked like high schoolers with no working/customer service skills, constantly forgetting how to properly set up the orders right before calling the customers name on the mic. Customers picking up their orders looked stressed out as if their orders were wrong.

I'm not a carnivorous person and finding out my burgers were 1/2lb patties just grossed the f out of me. Two bites and I couldn't continue, it felt like I was biting through an Elks torso. I make Elk burgers at home all the time, and I couldn't compare. Not to mention the 35 dollars for 2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 fountain drinks. This experience pissed me off, because I had just gotten off from my construction job, was hungry and tired. A 6 dollar burrito from the taco truck would have been more delicious, cheaper, and on point.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Once again I was invited to a restaurant that I have missed. I was really surprised at all there is with this restaurant. I would give this Fuddruckers 5 Stars except for a couple of things I will briefly mention at the end of this review.

First, I love to order my burger; cooked the way I like it (1/2 pound for me was very good). The burger is cooked and then I get to add all the things to it that makes my burger perfect. Lots of extra lettuce, extra tomato, extra pickles and easy onions (they have a lot more to choose from) and of course, mayonaise, mustard, and ketchup ( lot of tasty choices). This burger is way better than the competition!

I loved the French fries that came with my Hamburger, they were very tasty; cooked perfectly!  (I am hard to please)

The Coke machine was a bit funny for me as the machine (dispenser) requires a three week course in how to use it successfully (joking).  I did figure it out. The coke was the correct ratio of syrup to bicarbonate (some machines get it all wrong).

The interior is fun; a lot of interesting elements for decor. I talked with a few people about this place and got all favorable responses. From good to very good!

I read the reviews and they are mostly favorable also. I also like that the owner or manager responded to customers. I recommend that to all business owners.. It is smart and it will bring customers back.

I did mention that I would comment on a couple of things here at the end. Two points to greatly improve this location. The front exterior is a bit in disrepair but worse than that is the dirty awning (very dirty). Sorry, but that will turn some customers away and that would be sad because this restaurant is a good dining experience. The second issue is the Men's restroom has (terrible) graffiti; some of the windows at the front door also are"tagged". Having owned a store I found that removing graffiti right away is the best policy.

Thank you for a great burger. I will return and if those issues are resolved I will raise my review the 5 Stars.

Hope this helps!

<Review>Men's bathroom was the dirtiest I have ever seen, really! The papertowel rolls they have as napkins at all the tables were either empty or missing altogether. Many dirty tables needing to be busses and cleaned. Food always good but management needs to get out of the back office to the floor to see what's really going on.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>They have gone downhill from what I remembered. The food is tasty with some minor issues, and the whole place feels rundown in terms of the feel from the staff and the hardwares (equipments and decorations) throughout the restaurant. We got a huge clump of onion rings that was raw onion in the center because of the clumping together. While we were ordering the food, we can see all the pre-made-ready-to-go (buttered, and toasted) buns sitting there on the plates being stack together that filled up the entire counter right behind the register. Who knows how long those buns have been sitting there. The shake was good but took them a while to deliver it, because I think there was a mixed up with the orders. I feel like they are running this place without standards, or at least not anymore.</Text>< username>

The people behind the counter could have been more professional and it wasn't the cleanest place to eat, BUT the food was amazing! I had a turkey burger with guacamole and cheddar cheese on a wheat bun which they make on site. I added (from the bar) Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and jalapenos. Delish! The burger was cooked perfectly--thoroughly but still moist; the bun was grilled but still tender. I had the meal including sweet potato fries and a cherry vanilla Dr. Pepper (YUM!). I tried an onion ring from my friend's order and it was awesome...the batter was seasoned well; didn't need any sort of dipping sauce. My first time and comparable to 5guys! :D</Text>

Disgusting burgers, no flavor whatsoever and expensive for what your getting. All the food is bagged nothing is fresh not even the grilled onions or mushrooms they add on. It sits in a canister in a stew. Very disgusted and disappointed.<//Review>

Food was good, service was good, the arcade for the kids had more games that didnt work than what did work.

It took awhile to get my food and, in my opinion,  my burger was more greasy rather than juicy.  Fries seemed kinda old & soggy.  Lots of tables needed to be bussed.  It's ok but I expect more considering the price.< /review>

Was very disappointed that they didn't offer a 1 lbs burger they also didn't have red onions and my jalapeño cheese and fries were cold within mins of getting them.  Staff was nice and I would come back but if I was by another store that offers the pounder I would go there first.</Text>

< Review>
Good food, decent service, clean friendly atmosphere. Although I did stand (as the only customer) for nearly two minutes without being recognized in front of 2 order takers who didn't appear to be doing anything. They might have been checking systems, or might have just changed over. Still.. a quick 'hello, I'll be right with you" is always nice to have. It was kind of embarrassing to just stand there, not sure which crew member to approach, and wait to be acknowledge. This was my first time to any Fuddruckers so I may have not been sure of the protocol. Otherwise everyone was quite friendly and I was greeted by a preparer (manager?) from back near the grill as I walked in so I felt wanted and appreciated immediately.
I like that the burger is cooked to your specification and size.
I really liked the layout of the condiments. Everything you could ask for including jalapenos and pepperchinis arranged very carefully.
Bun appeared to be fresh baked and although large, still not quite big enough for 1/2 lb burger and all the fixin's. It was delicious, but pretty messy, LOL!

I enjoyed it and will return. Although I might get the 1/3 lb next time. The 1/2 lb was huge!

I didn't necessarily like the service here, the tables were dirty, the glasses were dirty, the service was not the best. Bread was soggy and the cooks passive agressively did everything we asked them not to.<//text>

WE ALL BUT WALKED OUT, IF I WASN'T AS DARN HUNGRY AND TIRED AS I WAS, I WOULD HAVE!!! This place was Beyond Dirty, and not just because of a few big parties, IT HAD ANTS AT *E*V*E*R*Y* TABLE!!!! Said they'd just been sprayed on the 7th, and five days later still infested... yeah right!!! And a little girl got the shock of her life, as she tried my moms handicapped bathroom stall, and the lock wasn't working... bless both their hearts. Never again!!! Even after complaining on both counts to "Thomas", the manager, and now he's out here helping bus the tables and clean. Out of ALL the Fuddruckers we've been to, never ever encountered as dirty and poorly managed and understaffed restaurant in all our lives. He either  needs to train his employes better, or training himself, and get help from Undercovera Boss to see how aweful it is.

Adrianne Ramirez, the Captain... behind the grill... gave the only smile and thank you we received during our visit. Thanks, Adrienne.<//review>

Overpriced, burgers are bland and cold at times. Don't waste your money if you want a good burger go to fatburger instead.< /Review>

<Text>I love this place, JUMBO burgers, usually 1/2 or 2/3 pound for me, my Atkins following friends get the 1 pounder. Then at the condiment bar I load it up with tonz of jalapeo cheese, forget the 50 cents for a slice of cheese on the burger, I'll take it by the quart. I also usually get fries with it, and more cheese for them.

It is usually (ok always) loud there, often bus loads of kids going to or from Knott's.<//Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) All-you-can-eat hamburger ingredients are self-service.
Sauces with cheddar cheese and potatoes are of course self-serve.
It is voluminous enough to leave the locals home, and basically has a slightly darker salty taste.
If you want to eat Kotekote junk food, it's worth a look.
The Strawberry Shake was even more satisfying with the fruit.

(Original)
ハンバーガーの具はセルフサービスで詰め放題。
チェダーチーズやポテトに添えるソース類ももちろんセルフ。
現地の方も残して帰るくらいボリュームのある感じで、基本的には塩味が若干濃い目。
コテコテのジャンクフードを食べたいなら一見の価値ありです。
ストロベリーシェイクは果実も入ってて満足感高めでした。< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The hamburgers 🍔 are very tasty but very expensive I paid $ 20 for a medium hamburger accompanied by Onions Rings and a Milkshake multiplied for two people are $ 40 ufff I don't know if they charged me more or what happened but the Supervisor told me that that's how that combo cost 🙈 . I don't know what happened if only a hamburger 🍔 costs like $ 6 dollars and the rest ??? . Too much 😅.

(Original)
Las hamburguesas 🍔 están muy ricas pero muy caras pague $20 por una hamburguesa mediana acompańada de Onions Rings y un Milkshake multiplicado para dos personas son $40 ufff no se si me cobraron de más o que paso pero la Supervisora me dijo que así costaba ese combo  🙈. No se que paso si solo una hamburguesa 🍔 cuesta como $6 dólares y el resto ??? . Demasiado 😅.</review>
