I didn't expect that The asian food fusion here would answer my need, but I was wrong! The food here is awesome! If you're looking for something that really spicy and burn your throat, this place is your answer. Papaya salad is the best!!!! Love it< /Review>

They use to be amazing!
Now they are mediocre at best :'(
Just look at their Tom Yum soup with beef!!  It use to be a super rich, white broth with an amazingly complex flavor.
But now, all of a sudden, it is a disappointing brown broth soup with mushrooms....

<Review>Went here for the first time tonight, AMAZING. Outstanding service, I believe it was the owner who took our order and told us it would be 20-25 minutes, and the food was ready on time. Large portions and the best Thai I have ever had. I got the pork drunken noodle spicy. My wife got the chicken pad Thai not spicy, and we ordered a beef Thai salad as well. The meat was tender on everything, the noodles were great and the salad was outstanding! We will be eating here again and sharing this place with all of our friends!<//Review></record>

I'm not sure why I even give this place 1 star except the lady was very nice.  This place use to be awesome.  Came back and it was horrible.  The mango was green and unripe in the salad. The Tom Yum soup was brown water with mushrooms and chicken.  No galangal, lemon grass, fish oil. Horrible flavor.  Tried to take it back up to the window and they were closed. Such a shame.</Review>

We ordered yellow curry, roti and Shrimp pineapple rice.
Food is good but it could have been better.
Roti was bit oily and the Shrimp was bland.
The good thing is the portion of food is big, usually we ordered 2 items for 2 of us and are able or finish it.
This time we have to take Togo everything.<//Review>< gmapID>

<userid>108744312439460682853</userid><rating>5<//rating><Text>Literally so good. I was here for dinner 2 days ago and still thinking about it. I shared the fried chicken and drunken noodles with a friend and we left SO happy. Noodles were generous with lots of good veggies and chicken. Usually I pick through stuff like that but I was too focused on shoving it in my mouth to do that. The fried chicken with lime sauce was so good I saved a tiny bit at the corner of my plate to end my meal with and let me tell you, GREAT DECISION. The sales that came with it was also great. The magnum opus, however, was definitely their homemade chili garlic sauce. They sell it at the restaurant and I knew from the first bite I wasn't leaving without a container of it. It was so flavorful and a great level of spice. I can't wait to cook with it at home.

Also the restaurant is family ran and the two sisters waiting on us were so sweet and welcoming. Honestly if you only have one meal in Fort Bragg, I would recommend here.<//Text><name>Charles Hawthorne</name><Gmap_id>0x808035790e7a0cad:0x14badc2acc9de2da< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

COVID-19 diaries: They have parking out in front and eqsy access.Only takeaways no dine in. We tried the pho, which we liked and a stir fry, which we didn't. The pho broth tasted nice and its quantity was insane (will last you 3 meals). The vegetables in the pho had been overcooked. The stir fry was mostly cabbage and the vegetables were soggy with all the sauce.< /text>

<Text>Some of the friendliest people we have met. They found out my friend was celebrating his birthday, and three waitresses came out and sang happy birthday. The food was excellent too! The restaurant was located in an historic lumber company office building converted into retail shops but full of old photos of the days it was used as a lumber company HQ. A great place to visit and enjoy a great meal with good company!</Text>< Pictures>

We passed this town today while visiting Albion. With covid going on and passing thru town I'm glad they had a little sitting area out in the hall since dining in was not an option. The food was delicious full of flavors! Even my parents agree. I highly recommend. If you are visiting and looking for an authentic Thai restaurant look no further.< /text>

If you want good Thai, this is the right place. If you want a fusion restaurant, you'll want to look elsewhere. The "fusion" is your typical mixture of Thai and Laotian dishes. With the exception of a couple items, everything on the menu is exactly what you would expect to find at a normal Thai restaurant. The food is good, and I would eat here again. It's just not what I expected based on the name.< /text>

Excellent Thai restaurant. Waitress was prompt, polite, and professional. Food arrived quickly, was of high quality, and was perfectly seasoned. Prices are fair and portions are generous. I ordered the Thai Basil (Pad Graw Prow), chicken, Thai hot. The chicken pieces were juicy and on the larger size, which I prefer, and the chili sauce was sweet with enough of a syrupy character to nicely coat the vegetables and chicken. There were plenty of chopped Bird peppers to get the heat level up, although this dish today was not what I'd consider a "10" on the heat scale, more like 8.5. I feel confident that they could make it hotter if requested.

This is a young restaurant, and it warmed my heart to see lots of people coming in to eat as we were eating. I want to eat here again on my next visit to Fort Bragg!< /Text>

We passed by Asian Fusion Sea Valley  on the way back from Oregon trip. Well-balanced of spicy and sweet flavor with Thai seasoning merged into Mango Salad, Tom Yum Soup, and Angel Chicken that we ordered. It was surprisingly delicious! Dishes' presentation and portion size were great. I would like to go back and order same dishes again.</Text>

VERY friendly staff, great pho and pad thai. Will definitely be returning next time I come through Fort Bragg. They also have a bunch of different house made sauces chillin on each table. All the sauces are really great and I highly recommend if you visit here that you try them all. This really is a great establishment and I wish we had more restaurants as good as this one where I live.</Review>

Literally $20 for one pad Thai with tofu, worse I’ve ever had in my life.
Noodles were soggy and swimming in very sour sweet and sour sauce. Clear veggies. The extra $4 you pay for tofu gets you three wet chunks out of the box.
Awful. Just awful.
Edit: the chef informed me that someone had switched the pad Thai sauce to salad dressing, which explained why it was horrible. She gave me a new meal for free and it was much better. still not worth $20 but raising to 2 stars for the hospitality.< /review>

<Review>This place is great! I tried Himalayan tea, a smoked chicken dish, and chili momos. Everything was amazing. The owner also threw in the lamb tacos, which are a really smart dish. Basically everything we tried was fantastic.</Review>< pictures>

First time for us tonight and definitely won’t be the last. Our neighbor highly recommended this restaurant and we will be passing the word to others.  Food is fresh and flavorful, best Indian I’ve had in quite a while, and has the bonus of a selection of dishes from Nepal.< /Text>

Love, love, love the food! We ordered a variety of dishes in order to have a sampling of flavors. I am absolutely in love with the fish curry and the Saag dish from the lunch menu. Good size portions and excellent quality. Raj, the owner, brought out a few other small items for us to try. Must say, I am completely impressed with my first meal here and plan to be back soon and often.<//Review>

It was great. The foods are fantastic. The unique part is the head chef comes to the costumers and takes the review on that food. That is so sweet of him. I don’t see that much in other indian restaurant.< /review>

You should advertise on here that you are cash only. In this age of technology you should at least have a square. The taco truck at my construction jobsites have a card reader you could at least get one to accommodate this age of technology.

Food smelled good though<//Text>

As always the food is great. But the service is just not there. I have been a long turm customer, since Bartolo was there. He made you feel welcome and appreciated. That is not so now. It seems like these people are their against their will, and make you feel like they can't get rid of you soon enough.< /review>

<Text>Dear Lord this is hands down, THE best carnitas I've ever had in my life! Visiting from Flagstaff AZ, had no idea we'd run into a place like this being as our host introduced us to the owners. Gracias hosts! Lovely, friendly people. We're Native American so we don't know a whole lot of Spanish but that didn't duo then from being ever so diplomatic. Amazing!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Best carnitas ever! The owner, Antonio, prepares everything from scratch on daily basis. Order your carnitas with everything, and it comes with melt in your mouth skin and succulent intestines.<//text>

< Review>
The best authentic Mexican carnitas in the Bay Area. They have all meat or mixed which means you get most of the other non meat items which are very tasty. The salsa is amazing on the carnitas. They also have fabulous chicharrón thick and thin and great nopales. Take a bag of carnitas to go or eat inside.  Simply the best!<//Review>

Great tasting carnitas on weekends only expect a line of people waiting to be served or take it to go which seems more popular. Best deal is a pound of carnitas with rice and beans and green tomatillo sauce.< /text>

Carnitas was served cold. They never have all the variety of the pork carnitas like they always run out of cueritis etc. Not like it used to be. I don't recommend.   They should have hand made tortillas instead of those warmed wicrowaves one's duhh...<//Review>

The  Carnitas are the best anywhere! The owner uses special spices from Mexico to give it this great flavor! The rest of the food is good also the steak meat has great flavor and my grandson is real picky for his steak burritos and he loves their steak meat( carne asada) they're only open Friday Saturday and Sunday so if you don't get there by 1 o'clock you might be out of luck on the pork meat(carnitas). Wish they were open a little more days in service is a little slow but the owner tries his best!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Always the same, Friday disks open at 10, it was 10:18 and they did not open, on Saturday disks open at 9:20 and it was my turn to be 9:20 and they have not opened, Only for fame and that they are rich, Do not take advantage and be clear in their timeless. Nothing is eternal in this life.

(Original)
Siempre lo mismo,Viernes disque abren a las 10,eran las 10:18 y no abrían,los sábado disque abren a las 9 y me ha tocado que sean 9:20 y no han abierto, Solo por la fama y que están ricas, no se aprovechen y sean claros en sus  es eternohorarios. Nada es eterno  en esta vida.😠🤬<//Review>

Best barbershop I been to in the EastBay. The vibe is perfect like the spot I used to get cut up at in my younger days. Great barbers & the "WALK IN ONLY" is why I choose to be a returning customer. Definitely recommend!!

< Review>
Stayed for a couple nights and wasn't allowed to leave my bed or drink water. Upon checking out, I complained to management and was promptly robbed of everything on me and dragged out to the curb. A couple days after returning home I got a letter from their legal team stating that they were suing me for "harming" their "message" and "hurting the most precious feelings of our Lord and Savior David Miscavige"! What the heck do I do!? Definitely won't be coming back after THAT experience. Sheesh!<//Review>

Unless it isn't THEIR way of freedom, in which case you won't see your family again, will probably spend years in the hole and will probably get killed if you dare ask for more than $20 per week just a few years into a "billion year contract."

There are far better ways of getting help if you need it. Don't turn to these charlatans.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80db68009cd14559:0x99e5a812304a151a</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Quiet little bed and breakfast tucked in the foothills of the San Jacinto mountains. Great place to relax and disappear. Views are spectacular from the Gold Base and the security is great. No one is getting in here without a reservation. I would definitely recommend it. If you go and you find Michele tell her I said hi👋🏽</Review>

<text>Ordered a room for me and my wife so we could get some sleep and have an escape from the kids. We quickly realized something was off. We were told to stay away from Room 237, and to not ask questions. When we arrived to our room, it turned out to be a cell. They separated the women and the children. I was locked in a cell for 1001 nights, where I was forced to perform heinous acts. I was finally let go, but by then I was a changed man. I wonder where my wife is. Good coffee though.< /text>< userid>

It is recommended that you avoid this area. Don't even drive on the road here. If you have to, do not stop.</text>

this is how the accountants of your Church are handling the pandemic, when so many are giving to us the victims - Roann Kopel
A riddle: What company is increasing rates for May even though there are no amenities. You got it: Apache Wells RV resort owned by Cal-Am Properties, Inc. One of the largest RV property companies in the country. There has been no pool or any other amenities since mid-March. And they even took the gate off the dog park. So dogs get no free play. They canceled all the parties including farewell party. And still they increased summer rates based on much higher rates for 2021. This is 2020. An already stressful year. Is there any other company in this already stressed country increasing rates while not even opening the pool. Even big insurance companies give discounts because customers can't use amenities. No discounts for Cal am parks. They are increasing rates. What company does that.?!<//text>

I live near by.  Stoped to take a few pictures and was asked to not to and told the police were on there way.  Also by using google maps just go past the big house and see if you can find the covered hidden cameras on top of the mountain. But I will go agin and get pic of the prison.< /text>

Pay tens of thousands of dollars to receive our "religions" benefits, be our personal slaves, if you're not somebody you're nobody. That pretty much sums up this place. Gold Base? More like Lil North Korea. Hey David Miscavige how's you're dad doing these days? You have taken Short Man's Syndrome to complete new level.< /text>

I saw the staff here deliberately get in the face of some journalists taking some photos in front of the building. Around a half dozen staff shined super bright lights in the journalists faces and then kept taunting them. They acted like 5 year old children, because they apparently didn't like the way the journalists were reporting on the "Church" of Scientology. If this is the manner they conduct themselves as their headquarters, then it speaks volumes of the organization. Disgraceful... avoid this cult.< /review>

<Review>Massive let down. Did not meet Xenu or Tom Cruise. No airstrip for Johnny to land his Jett. Shelly seemed nice (until David got to her). This place is Operating Thetan better than that of a failed Science Fiction writer. I'm really disconnected from this supressive environment and I feel that I'll lose my Freedom Medal of Valor to be Fair Game in Operation Snow White...</Review>< response>

The experience staying here was generally bad, until the guy that I assume to be a secret agent came in and freed everyone after parachuting into the courtyard.  That was cool.  He was super nice too, making clever quips while fighting the guards and generally being charming in every way.  Had a number for a name I think; hard to remember after the drugging/beatings...

Had to walk home though, no Uber, no taxi, nothing.  Totally inconsiderate of the management.  1/10< /Review>

Scientologists bought an old bankrupt hot springs and turned it into their "Gold Base" headquarters. I wonder what they did with the hot springs and if it is now some kind of religious chamber for purification.<//review>

<pics>None</pics><Text>David M is just a joy to be around, and for someone only 5’5 tall or so, can hit a drive well in excess of 190 yards, which is impressive in my opinion.  The facilities here are as well tendered and equipped as Nazi germany, both the Nazi bases and POW camps, but let’s face it, there are bad people everywhere that need locking up and made to work free of charge from time to time! The choice of clothing you can choose from will either make you appear normal or a complete psychopath, it’s a lottery really, my personal fav is the men in black style with a pale face and thousand mile
stare look.  After my visit I am no longer scared of small rooms with no WiFi or civilian contact.  I think what I’m really trying to say is, I will be returning, and this time bringing some cordial and I may even gift David with a picture of us both naked riding a unicorn behind Tom whose on a massive chocolate chip muffin with the word, evolution bitten into the side of it, I’m sure he will love this.< /Text><user_name>Rob Scales< /user_name><user>109519138492313857596</user>< date>

Rehan was so much help as we switched up our phone plans and purchased new devices. He was friendly, patient, and very knowledgeable. All of the employees we encountered here were very kind and worked with positive attitudes and a teamwork approach. I continue to come to this location, and I have always been happy with my service.</Text>

I had a great experience here.  I came in for some help transferring my contacts from my old (very old) phone to my new one. staff was so nice.  She cut down my old SIM card then -realizing that my contacts weren't saved on my SIM- managed to piece my old card back together and retrieved my contacts! If I could give 10 stars I absolutely would!<//text>

<Text>Honestly faster and better service than a physical store. The staff is really helpful and down to earth. ATT wouldn't let me handle my trade in for my iphone online so I resorted to  finding a local solution and I'm glad I did because now I will be using them for all my Apple purchases. They're right outside of Zales on the second floor.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>Everyone in here was super helpfully and nice. Store is clean. It's in a busy part of town. The person that helped me switch from another carrier did all the work and made it easy.

<Review>Very good service. Would highly recommend this location to anyone buying a new phone and still have certain doubts and uncertainties from one phone to the next. Spent a fair amount of time with the associates. Helpful all the way through. Certainly happy with my choice. Thank you!</Review>< Rate>

I've been with this store, if you will, for two years.  Both times were great.  The staff are informative on sales, deals, packages, but not overly pushy.  Also, they are attentive.  Particularly, the one salesperson is really down to earth and makes changes to your account seamlessly; and he has years of experience.</review>

Came to this store to exchange a phone bought at another location. Employees helped me above and beyond. Especially Rehan, he made sure I didn’t leave until all my needs were met and satisfied. Great environment overall and very professional. Best AT&T store inside Burbank Town Center Mall.<//text>

Rehan Sha is awesome, ask for him! He is super friendly and an expert! He got me a great deal and set up my new phone for me. Everything was so easy with him! I walked out of the store ready to use my beautiful new phone (he even helped me pick it out) and am so happy. Thank you, Rehan Sha!< /Text>

<review>Good customer service. Visit the store just to make payment but it would be convenient if they had a kiosk for those that like to pay cash or cc payment.

My husband and I came in with our 2 boys who are very young 3 and 2. Were waited for for about 15 mins then received the best customer service possible! HE is the one that helped us and he was extremely patient with our little ones while we switched over our service from t-mobile to AT&T. It took about 2 hours and I’m very satisfied with the customer service we received!< /text>

I had such a great experience at this AT&T! Rehan was extremely helpful and walked me through all of my options after damaging my phone. I’m now walking away with an upgraded phone with no hassle at all, as well as a lot of new knowledge about the iPhone that I didn’t know before. Thanks again!< /text>

Rehan Sha, the AT&T associate, went above and beyond to provide outstanding service! We had a challenge with equipment but he was able to solve it. It is this kind of service that keeps me with AT&T. Well done!< /Review>

My phone stopped receiving some calls today.  After a fruitless call with AT&T/FIrstNet support who blamed a tower, I stopped into this store.  Three different employees including the manager all got involved and after multiple calls to AT&T support, they got my phone working.   What surprised me was their attitude -- they weren't going to let me leave without getting my phone fixed.  Gracious service that went above and beyond the call today.  (Pun intended.) Best store inside Burbank Town Center Mall.< /text>

I walked into this store inside Burbank Town Center Mall with 2% phone battery and was greeted by Rehan Sha with a smile! I asked if I could charge my phone and he was very kind and allowed me to charge to 100%. This may not mean much to anyone, but some locations give you a hard time, if you are not needing service/sale items. All of the staff was really nice.<//review>

I came to the store upset due to having a extremely horrible morning. All I wanted to do was set up a phone plan for my mom, who lives off of those little prepaid flip phones, and leave. I have to say I was in just shocked at the service I was given. If I could I’d give them 10 stars. The Store manager that assisted me was Rehan Sha. He was so sweet and understanding. He took his time with me because he knew I was in such a dreadful and unfavorable mood. I do apologize again for how I treated y’all when I walked in. Thanks again for your service! I will be coming back. Awesome store inside Burbank Town Center Mall<//review>

I went into the store on 17th Market and was very upset my phone didn't work the Representative name Rehan was very very helpful, great customer service skills and Professional with assisting at my time and need. He did what we could to help me walk out with a Brand  new phone  (Upgraded and great features) even when I thought the odds was against me with a lower Bill. Thank You Rehan for your   Great Services, Job well done<//Review>

<Text>Rehan, the store manager of this store, was hands down the most helpful, engaged, AT&T employee that I have ever had the pleasure of working with. He embodies “customer-first” mentality and it showed in my overall experience on the phone. He resolved problems quickly, gave solid recommendations and was just a joy. I will be sure to always go to his store for any future purchases/services because I can only imagine how professional and friendly his team is! Thank you, Rehan Sha! Awesome store i.nside Burbank Town Center Mall</Text></record>

The staff at this location was amazing. I was helped by Rehan sha and he was patient with all the technical hiccups going on to activate a phone to my account. He called customer service and they took forever but he was patient about it and entertaining in the mean time. Was told by customers service would take a couple days to transfer the number but nothing. Went back and he remembered me. I hope more people understand that the team at this store try their best to get things done and sometimes it's out of their power do to technical difficulties for IT or customer service.  Bit all around a great location. Especially the associated Rehan sha .</Text>

<Review>Talked to a guy named Tony, was planing to get wifi, seemed very knowledgable when selling me the wifi, but then he ended up running my credit, without notifying me he’s doing so, he told me certain questions need to be answered to verify my identity. He called up some one who was supposed to verify my info which I gave correctly, the person didn’t speak English properly, so probably he didnt even understand me. Then that Tony guy told me that I am not approved, lol for what, for wifi? That’s nonsense, and the reason why was simply “i dont know man”. Total bs< /Review>< Resp>

we never go inside this store, but I always donate! I love it, because they will take in things no matter the shapes, size, or weight. They are grateful, and accept every donation. They are nice, and get the job done. taking the stuff, and putting it where it belongs. Then my mom and I just drive off and it's so easy to drop off the stuff! It goes to a good cause too. They do put the stuff in stores, and I heard some stuff goes to homeless, or raises money for children hospitals. Great place to donate things you don't want anymore.</text>

The customer service was great at this location. But they have a sign in the grass that say their *new low prices* but when you go inside the store the prices are nowhere close to being low for Salvation Army.
At thrift store Goodwill none of the above.<//Review>

It tickled me how some of the children wouldn't set on Santa's lap.

I especially liked Pablo's performance on the Alto Saxophone.

The MC was positive and humorous.  The desserts were delicious.

I had a great time.

Thank you Salvation Army ARC headquarters.</Review>< gmapID>

< Review>
Today 13Oct19 I came into Salvation army to look at some mattress sets and price them. To my surprise I found a brand new full set with box spring for a reasonable price. I stood in line just to ask questions about pricing and pick up. Right when Edward the manager was wrapping up with the  customer ahead of me, he looks my way and says" By law I have to take my lunch and clock out, but the lady across the way will take care of you"!....I laughed as I had never heard that one before. Yet the sales lady was wonderful in answering my questions. I stepped outside for a few to relay information to my husband and came right back in the store to ask another question my husband wanted to know before picking it up. When I came back to my surprise Edward the manager was ringing people up,,literally minutes after he excused himself for lunch. I waited in line for about 5 mins more when he took a phone call just right outside of cashier's station. After he finished the call I walked over and asked him if I could ask him a question. He looked me dead in my eyes with no phone attached to his ear as he had already finished his call mins prior and said" yes you can as soon as I am done with my phone call". Clearly he was off the phone and I at that point wasn't gonna call him on his bull, so I just stared back at him, and with no other excuses to give me he reluctantly turned and answered my question. Edward in my opinion in a classic older white racist guy,,who couldn't bring himself to want to help me. Even when I waited in line to pay,,yet again right when I was next..he called Tyshima who was fixing clothes on the floor to help me. He was not willing to help me at all. Racist manager, I cant believe him..sadly I'm not surprised...<//Review>

<Text>All kinds of great stuff here. I visit periodically just to see if I can find something collectible, or rare. Great prices, and the manager sometimes allows you to negotiate. I am a faithful customer tho😎 I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is a thrift shop junkee.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>Like many of the thrift stores, Salvation Army has raised the prices to cover the cost of California law of minimum wage.  Did you know that the "Goodwill stores CEO's salary tops $250,000. per year?  Salvation Army CEO remains at $12,000 yearly.  That is why I choose to support "The Salvation Army" store anytime I get a chance.</text>< Pics>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Hello google friend I’m a customer of Salvation Army for years I’ve been coming to this store and recently I was excited to see a wonderful young lady alba become part of management .she works hard and is very very help and polite with customer she’s alway there to great you and make you feel welcome . today I show up the store and alba is no longer part of management.so  Sad to see such a wonderful good roll model not be able to help us customers out ,while managers no where to be found so left and went to good will for furniture 😢. how sad this young lady has full potential and ambition and works great with her employees 😢. We need good management like her back and let me make it clear it’s the professionalism she Carries to the  customers.thank you alba for all your hard work you do for us 😢😢😢</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Great place for used items. Better than Goodwill because of their leadership and principles</review>

<text>I tried to give this store another chance...❗❗... But.... Unfortunately it was just clearly a big disappointment.. The reason I even gave it 2 stars 🌟🌟 is because of the nice sales clerk& because they do have half off on a certain color tag I believe each day. So if U shop the half off color ONLY then MAYBE U MIGHT find a good deal or two if U'r lucky... Aside from that THIS STORE IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE 4 A 2ND HAND, MEANING THE ITEMS IN THE STORE R USED, BUT U WOULD NOT KNOW THIS IF YOU WERE BASING IT ON THE PRICE OF THINGS IN THE STORE. I honestly find it rather insulting to come info a store where they are selling items that are USED for prices that many ppl honestly still can't afford, especially if your on a tight budget. The nerve this company has to hike up prices on items that they themselves have obtained completely and 100% percent FREE themselves. Salvation Army paid ABSOLUTELY ZERO DOLLARS 4 EVERYTHING THAT THEY R SELLING WITHIN ALL OF THEIR STORES BUT THEY FEEL THE NEED TO OVER PRICE PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THEY HAVE IN THEIR STORES. I thought this thrift store in particular was started too help the needy ppl in society..❗❗❗.. How is it that they r helping any one if what they are selling, which they paid ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR, is so expensive that the ppl who are coming in to these salvation army stores still cant afford theit outrageous prices..❓❓.. I fimd it absurd, INCREDIBLY SELFISH & WRONG OF THEM that they have the audacity 2 over price EVERYTHING that the Salvation Army gets FOR ABSOLUTELY FREE❗❗▪▪❗❗ TALK ABOUT REVENUE... CONSIDERING THEY GET THER PRODUCT THEY SELL IN THEIR STORES 4 FREE, THEY GET 100% PERCENT PROFIT.. WOW MUST BE NICE. Yes i know all thrift stores fall under this same umbrella, Goodwill in my opinion is the exact same including w/their outrageously expensive price tags, the only difference between the 2 is that at least goodwill has wearhouse auction stores where u have the opportunity to actually get good deals because u pay by the pound.. Also other thirft store that domt include the corporate BS like the two mentioned above, have much more fair pricing and deals. I love thrift store shopping hugely because I love finding deals but its sad that its totally IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY GO AND GET MUCH NEEDED THINGS THAT ARE 2ND HAND FOR A REASONABLE PRICE FEOM SO CALLED STORES THAT ARE SUPPOSEDLY MEANT TO HELP PPL THAT NEED IT THE MOST... JUST ANOTHER CORPORATE MONEY RACKET WHO CARE MORE ABOUT THE DOLLAR SIGN AND AMOUNT THEN ACTUALLY DOING WHAT THEY PREACH WHICH IS HELPING THOSE IN NEED...HMMMM I THINK I'M DONE W/THESE BIG NAME THRIFT STORES FOR NOW ON I'LL STICK TO THE UNKNOWN THRIFT STORES THAT ACTUALLY PRICE THEIR STOCK AT FAIR PRICES..<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I just bought a beautiful antique cabinet today, too bad the employees broke it in half (not repairable on my budget) while loading it into my truck. No refund offered, they blamed it on me repeatedly till I just gave up and left, even though I was not near what they were doing, wth? So yeah thanks for $70 of nothing and a big headache.< /text>

Good prices love what this company stands for and the staff is friendly and helpful even though they can forget they were helping you and have to be reminded a few times. One of the male managers were really helpful last time we were there.< /Text>

<review>This location has a good selection of household items, but prices tend to be a little high for used items.  Mens Clothing not well organized (for example - T Shirts are just put on the rack and not sorted by color or size).< /review>< pics>

<text>They need to decide where customers line up to purchase items.  Every time I came here, people just merely walked up to the counter to pay without waiting in line at the destined line waiting area.  What is sad is that the employees here did not seem to care.  I tried to voice my concern but it went on deaf ear.  Today was my last time coming here.</text><Time>1524590615688< /Time><rate>1< /rate><username>Phuong Nguyen</username></record>

This meal came with roughly 10 potatoes (while my mom had way more potatoes) and both my moms and my toast were dripping with butter that we didn't ask for. It took forever to get there and the server did not give us utensils (we had to go inside to ask for them). The ketchup bottle was also very sticky when I tried to grab it. The other table across from us was consistently being checked on while my mom and I were not being served or checked upon. First and last time ever coming here.</Text>

< review>
I took a walk around Lemon Grove on a Sunday morning and stopped inside this deli.  The heat hadn't hit yet and breakfast growly belly was restless.  I was looking for a fruit cup and wondered why I kept staring at the top part of the menu.  3 pancakes sounded delicious!  I ordered to go and took them home hot and fresh! Butter and syrup topped them off! They were huge for the money! I cut them in quarters to have for breakfast all week with meal plan. Delicious!! Friendly staff, good breakfast menu, and repeat customer here!</review>

The prices are a bit high and the online ordering can be more of a hassle than just ordering at the storefront. I once waited 10 minutes for an English muffin, it was a good English muffin, but it shouldn't have taken even half as long as it did. I do enjoy the big cup of grits and the french toast is good.<//text>< pictures>

Dont let the location fool you. This IS a hidden gem. There is not one bad item on the menu. I've been going there for years, and have yet to have a poor experience. The food is all good...no, very good and the staff are super. Please give Lemon Grove Deli & Grill a try; you wont regret it. Say hello to Erika!</Review>

We keep going back to this Deli even though it isn't close to where we live. Their food is very good and reasonably priced. Their breakfast specials are really hard to beat. The service is usually very good. Today was an exception. The service was not as good as usual.<//review>

One of my favorite places in San Diego. The club sandwich is awesome probably one of my favorites from anywhere. Breakfast is great. Pancakes, omelettes, potatoes are all great. All the other sandwiches and fries and stuff I've tried have been awesome.</Text>

So here's the thing, sometimes I'll stop eating here, and I'll eat the chicken fried steak from other places. And whenever I do this I start thinking, 'all chicken fried steaks taste the same,' because really most of them do. But then I'll eat here again and as soon as I eat the first bite I remember how wrong I am because somehow the chicken fried steak from this place is so much better than anywhere else.

Also, I've broken diets because of dreams of this places pastrami fries 😂😂< /review>

We love this place. We visited recently and noted that they updated the menu and lighting inside. This is a big improvement and glad they did this. The staff is always so friendly and helpful. Write a yelp review while you're there and show them and they'll give you ten percent off!  Monday through Friday I saw a banner advertising 3.99 breakfast. I have yet to try that but sounds like an awesome deal. If you haven't tried this place yet, I highly suggest you do!< /text>

The staff is always so friendly and helpful. Write a yelp review while you're there and show them and they'll give you ten percent off!  Monday through Friday I saw a banner advertising 3.99 breakfast. I have yet to try that but sounds like an awesome deal. If you haven't tried this place yet, I highly suggest you do!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<username>Tiffany Smith<//username><review>One of my favorite places for breakfast! I actually drive far to come here. We sit outside because it gets pretty warm inside. Nothing fancy about this place and that's ok. Breakfast is like having homemade breakfast...without the mess. I must always have hash browns with my breakfast and theirs are perfect. They have your typical breakfast food so if you crave it, they probably have it!<//review>< pictures>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>My first time here today, I witnessed a argument with the owner and a paying customer who got over charged for his meal! Then once we ordered pastrami fries and chicken cheesesteak fries. Pastrami came out and was fine the other was the wrong meal, which she said we can keep but the other one was coming out in a bit! It took 20mins to realize the other meal was turned into a sandwich, and was just sitting on the counter for about ten mins.  The waitress just kept apologizing to us. Well my date had told her to just bring the sandwich at no charge! So we got a free meal and sandwich and drinks for free. The owner came out and said "Mr. King was a good man but I wasn't expecting this much of a crowd. He made this day for other folks not me!" All I can say is that poor waitress! The cook thou he got issues either he doesn't speak and read English or he is just dumb messing up all those orders! The waitress made me give you a three star, but I will be back one day cause you can't find good pastrami in San Diego</Review></record></dataset><record>

Patrick helped me out. He’s a really good dude. He was patient and communicated very well. The sales manager was also a really nice dude. He went to task in getting me a better rate then what was being offered by my bank. Make sure you take the time to stop by and look at the beautiful vehicles that they have available here. I’m enjoying the Porsche that I bought from these gentlemen.< /review>

I was sold a unsafe car that function for two to three weeks at a time. The worst was the undisclose mechanical failures and the fraud surronding the purchase. From Chasis failure to sensors painted over with different color paint. Defective supension and the car previously deemed unsafe to drive</text>

< Review>
I own a driving school and have purchased several cars over the last couple of years.  The car buying experience at Showcase was simply amazing.  Stella is an absolute gem of a salesperson.  I told her I had some time constraints and she had me walking out of there, key in hand, in about an hour. The entire staff was accommodating and helpful. Showcase will be the first place I turn to when I'm ready for another car.< /Review>

<review>Working with Richard and Mike and the rest of the team was a good experience. The was no pressure and the experience was smooth and efficient. Between friend and family we have purchased five cars from showcase, and we will return when we need the next one.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Beautiful cars. Even more beautiful people! The customer service on the part of the sales reps (and various staff) was beyond proverbial par. For an experience where your status as a person supersedes the car buying, you'd do well to visit Steven's Creek Showcase. Especially if you are fortunate enough to talk with/deal with Ms Stella. She is sooo genuine - a beautiful soul! If I could steal her away I would. She repetitively went above and beyond board to assist me in my experience. She's a jewel.
Do yourself a favor, go see the folks at Steven's Creek Showcase!</review>

<response>None<//response><text>Stella Benjamin was an absolute pleasure to work with. I found my daughter's car online. Stella was fast and easy to work with. I have bought at least 20 cars in my life and always felt like I was being hustled. We did not feel this way at all with Stella. She was straight forward, transparent and generally nice.  If I could buy all of my cars from Stella I would.<//text>< Rating>

Had a great experience with these guys! Stella was our consultant and wow, did we luck out! She made everything so super easy and was really easygoing and no-pressure at all during the selling and transaction process. 5/5 recommend to anyone looking to purchase a quality vehicle!<//Text>

< Review>
We are very happy with our purchase at this car dealership. We searched online and found the car we wanted for the best deal in the region, called the dealer to request a summary of the car price plus dealership and dmv fees so we can know ahead of time exactly what we're paying for and how much. We then drove an hour and a half from the north bay, and by the time we got there, the car and paper work we're ready for us. We test drove the car, signed the paperwork, and took care of payment. Since we paid in full, and therefore bought the car "as is", we added on a 3 year extended warranty for extra reassurance. We appreciate the prompt, professional, and personable service we received from Ali Sheikhan. Definitely recommend this used car dealership and salesperson!<//Review>

With the help of Stella, I purchased a Mercedes GLE. I purchased the vehicle from out of state and never visited the dealership. Stella provided a very pleasant experience. She was thorough and willing to help with all of my questions and requests, from sending me additional photos and video, to assisting me with setting up services after the purchase.

< Review>
terrible experiences buying a car here. charged me top dollar for a car with scratched on the doors and would not pay a body shop. they said they replaced the cabin filter and engine air filter during inspection, and they were filthy, the arm rest broke shortly after, they did a really terrible job painting the front and rear bumper. none of the the transmission fluid was changed like the schedule service was required.  brake fluid was disgusting, if you do choose to buy a vehicle from them  GET IT INSPECTED FIRST FROM the oem manufacture first!!!!!!!!!! purchased a repair contract,  showed me the price of 2700 but charged me 3300.!!!!!! they totally bated and switch me!!!!!!</Review>

<text>SCS has a great selection of luxury cars.  I found the vehicle I wanted and transaction was very smooth.  They were very helpful in finding the best auto loan rate.

<Text>Arash, the GM, is the most professional automotive seller I've ever encountered. It was such a pleasure to deal with him. Always putting the customer's needs first. I'm not advocate for used cars at all, but the experience with this dealership under the leadership of Mr. Arash is off the charts. Give them a try!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808fcb55380b6757:0xb51230f2006c7d5c</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Went into the lot to check out a car without full intentions of buying, Ali the salesmen came out, greeted himself and talked about the car without pressuring me to buy and even offered to test drive it. Went back the next day and am now a new car owner! business was nothing but honest and straight forward. Would highly recommend for good deals and helpful service.</Text><user_name>Milo Garcia< /user_name><response>None< /response></record>

We purchased a new vehicle from Stevens Creek Show Case. Stella was the sales consultant who helped my family and I. She made our car buying experience a great one. Her patience, welcoming personality helped ease the anxiety of car shopping. My family and I walked away in a great car with a great deal! Thank you Stella!!!!< /Text>

Steven's Creek Showcase has a great selection of higher end vehicles, but it was the charger that caught my eye, Fadi was a great help in getting me into my new car, even though it was not ready to be put out on the lot, I demanded to have first looks at the vehicle and Fadi was very accommodating. Good experience with the whole staff, have Fadi share his Jordanian coffee too, its delicious!</Text>

Scheduled my appointment to test drive the 2016 Range Rover Sport that was posted on their website, and was able to make a visit without any hassle thanks to the help of Stella. She was very helpful and informative, and same goes for the general manager Arash, who also assisted in closing the deal on the vehicle. They were open to negotiation which I appreciated, and overall was a very smooth experience here at Stevens Creek Showcase. I highly recommend visiting this dealership.< /review>

I am writing this review right now and am still waiting for my papers to sign. But I couldn’t wait more as I am sooo happy with my whole experience. This place is very clean the cars are well kept, they believe in quality over quantity. FADI is awesome!!!! If you ever step into this place make sure to only get help from Fadi. He is so honest, and you can tell how much knowledge he has about cars. He nailed it and was able to change my mind on the car I was gonna buy. They have all the luxury cars you are looking for and for a very fair price. I always hate to deal with dealers while buying a car but fadi did a terrific job not pushing me, yet explaining each car and trying to find the best for what am looking for.< /review>

The salesman I talked to Ali didn’t even want to help me I called him to try and get a certain price and told him to call me back with any information and he never called I had to call back a second time and then he began to lie to me and tell me that his manager was busy and didn’t want to let me speak to his manager that’s an awesome way to run a dealership keep up the good work and I was a paying customer don’t go to this dealership<//Review>

Marcus and Freddie are friendly and easy to work with, no annoying hard pressure sales, and very efficient once we made up our minds on a car. We came by a couple of times over the past month, looking for a very specific hard top convertible. We finally drove out of there with our dream car, the sales process took less than an hour. If you're looking for something specific, keep checking their website, they update it regularly, that's how we lucked out on a hard to find used vehicle. We would definitely recommend these guys to work with!< /text>

Anyone thinking of buying a used car should not just look at the average stars and ratings, but read the extremely negative reviews. Even if only 10% of reviewers give a rating of 1 that is not good enough with cars.

This dealership does not honor its warranties. They sold a lemon car that had a major engine problem that caused an engine failure soon after the car was sold, and then did not agree to either repair it or take the car back. No one should have to put up with that. Go somewhere else with a more reputable dealer.< /Text>

This establishment has to be one of the most shady businesses I’ve ever encountered.  Unethical, deplorable and low service establishment.  I’m shocked they exist as a viable business in such a scrutiny driven community.  They’ve lied on numerous occasions whilst I showed interest in a car they posted online and have on their lot.  If you value your time and $$$ I suggest patronizing more reputable dealerships.  Management is deaf to standard business accountability and are incapable of delivering service to discriminating customers.  IF YOU WANT BAD SERVICE feel free to patronize the lowest of low!< /Text>

Slimy pieces of sh*t.  Listen to the negative reviews below.  These guys are the reason used car salesmen are openly despised.  They listed a 2016 grey Mercedes c63s for 48k.  I called from out of town, agreed to their 48k asking price, put down $1000 deposit, took a vacation day from work and flew up there the next day to pick it up.  First of all, turns out the car didn't have the options they listed online.  Second the steering wheel was broken and needed to be fixed by the dealership under warranty (a defect I discovered 15 min after the manager assured me they had done "120 point inspection just that morning" and that the car was flawless.  Ha!). Third, the trim pieces were falling apart.  They returned my deposit and flew me home saying they'd call when the car was ready in a few days.  However, when I called them a week later (they never did reach out) they said the car was fixed, all under warranty,  and in perfect condition...but now the price was 50k!!!  I told them we had a deal that I had put money down on, not to mention the time and effort to travel there based on that deal, and they said they just thought they could get more for the car so that's the new price.

Anyways, based on the particulars of my situation with them my lawyer thinks I have a good case (their actions are literally that desipicable) and I am currently filing a lawsuit.  The irony is that it's going to cost them more just to fight me in court than it would have been to have just honored the deal.

Seriously, f*@k these guys.</Review>

Stevens Creek Showcase is a great dealership! I spotted them yesterday and decided to check out their cars because they have some beautiful rides on their lot.

I drove in on a whim after seeing one of their cars online. I felt at ease working with Said from beginning to end and couldn’t recommend him/Stevens Creek Showcase any more. They are very easy to work with and have a really great selection of pre-owned luxury cars. Less than 48 hours later I ended up purchasing the car I originally saw online. I am so happy with my car and would without a doubt think of them again for my next car purchase!< /text>

<Text>We drove two hours to get here to look at a truck. We meet with Said Tarim. We called the previous day and he was very kind and answered all of our questions.  Brought us on a test drive and was very personable with us throughout the whole process. The team that works there worked very hard on ensuring that we got a great deal and was very friendly. The experience was much better than dealing with of the big name auto dealerships. I would recommend this place to anyone who wanted to buy a car.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< review>
Worst car buying experience of my life. I bought my car a month ago and I’m still living the nightmare. The rims that came with the car were too big to fit on my Dodge Challenger. Two out of the four rims broke while I was driving down the freeway! The tire shop mechanic said those rims should have never been on the car. It cost me thousands of dollars to have the replaced. The check engine light has come on two times already and the Ally warranty cover they give you is garbage. They said the car was inspected, but the guy must of been blind. I knew the exhaust was modified before buying the car, but when I asked them about it, they just said it would pass smog. The exhaust noise was way too loud and I’ve been pulled over by the CHP for it. It’s a $1000 fine and then you have to get it fixed. Just more money down the drain. I wish I would’ve done my homework in the car and the dealership before buying.</review>

<response>None</response><text>I had an excellent experience at Stevens Creek Showcase.
Amazing selection of quality cars with no high pressure sales techniques.
"Said" helped me the first day I was there, and was assisted on my second visit by another salesman (forgot the name unfortunately).
Both salesmen were excellent, no pressure just showed me the cars and went on test drives. Ended up getting a low mileage 2016 Corvette Z51, after driving a Jaguar F type, BMW Z4, and BMW M4.
Would definitely recommend the dealership without reservation.

EDIT: Bought a second car from Stevens Creek Showcase for my daughter this time.
Again everyone I dealt with was very friendly and professional.
I highly recommend "Said", pronounced  Sayeed, as your salesman.
Zero pressure, very helpful.
Finance was a breeze.
If you are looking for a quality used car at a fair price, SCSC is the place to find one.

A large collection of high quality luxury cars and SUVs. I found exactly what I needed at a good price with no sales pressure. Amazing how that works in a low stress environment. Thank you to all who helped me make this purchase.<//Review>

<text>Stevens Creek Showcase sold me a lemon. I strongly urge you to take your business elsewhere. They have an on site mechanic who can manipulate the warning sensors ect. If there is any warning light it means there is a critical expensive engine failure otherwise they would have fixed it already. I'm just glad I didn't get their warranty plan because it wouldn't have covered an $8000 engine replacement.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808fcb55380b6757:0xb51230f2006c7d5c</gmapID></record>

I David Molina recently bought a 2014 crew cab denali , at stevens creek showcase few days before thanksgiving. Just wanted to say sales team Mike and managment went over and beyond to try and help me get qualified for a vehicle, due to i had bad credit, they bought down my credit to qualify me, as for down payment for $6000 down they offered me 10 days extention, but then were able to qualify me with $3000 down only. Then still broke it down in two payments, and even with being closed on thanksgiving , they even went and opened up showroom so i can pick up vehicle on thanksgiving since that was the day i had off and avilable to pick ready in time for holiday. Big thanks to sales rep Mike Stens , and stevens creek showcase financial team and owner who made everthing possible to work within my favor to get me into a nice reliable vehicle.</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Steven's Creek Showcase (SCS) is absolutely amazing. I have a 750 credit score, and all my credit cards are always completely paid off. Not even my own bank Chase was going to finance my car, and I have been with Chase for a long time. I decided to take a drive from Monterey, CA to San Jose out of curiosity and look for my favorite car - the Jaguar F-Type. They had a 2015 model with only 7160 mi on it. The owner said that getting the credit would be a lot easier to get than my drive to San Jose. They ran my credit, and found the best financing deal for me. Even better than Chase would had given me. Normally, it would take hours to leave any dealership with a car due to all the paper work, etc. I was out of there with my Jag within an hour. In addition, I also received a 5 year full coverage warranty on anything that may go wrong for only $5.00 additional a month. Amazing cars, awesome service, NO pushy sales people!!<//Review>< pictures>

I bought a beautiful Audi A6 2014 TDI from Steven's Creek Showcase from Pennsylvania sight unseen except for the photos posted and a video. The car was represented honestly & accurately. There was a potential delay with the title and paperwork from Calif DMV but Arash the GM handled this issue and worked out any delays so the paperwork came thru much faster than expected.  Customer service was very good and since I was purchasing the car from 3000 miles away these assurances were greatly appreciated. Mike my salesman was also great to deal with and always responded to my questions very quickly!  I highly recommend Stevens Creek Showcase.< /Text>

<Review>I been car shopping for 2-3 days. From Audi,  Mercedes, Lexus and even the main Land Rover dealership.  I wasn’t  happy with the experience I’ve had. I left there feeling  intimidated . Yesterday my husband and I decided to stop by Steven creek showcase to check out a couple of cars. Upon arrival we were greeted by Said ( forgot his last name but, I think it’s started with a letter T.)
He’s so friendly, patient and such a great help. He’s  not being pushy  or intimidate you to get you to  purchased something more expensive at all.
Over all I had a great experience there.
Oh and last but not least I also want to thanks the general manager there for working with us to give us a great deal.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<text>Bought a used Audi Q7 last week from SC Showcase. Josh Hogan was a great salesman, very patient and little pressure to buy, was more than happy to show me all the cars and drive any I had interest in. All their cars seemed to be high quality with low mileage and very competitive prices. Josh and Arash (finance) concluded all the paper work and I was out of there in good time. Highly recommend SCSC to anyone looking for a good deal on a quality used car</text>< pictures>

Buyers beware! This dealer sold me a mercedes cla45 amg on mar 3. Only after 2 weeks of owning the car i got a check engine light and told them about it. They immediately told me i should have bought warranty from them.I brought it to a mb dealer and told me i needed a new transmission. Mercedes told me the total cost would be 9k. Horrible dealer selling messed up cars... also gave me a hard time claiming my gap insurance<//Review>

<time>1545440978926<//time><review>If you're looking for a used car go see Josh Hogan. the other salesmen will also help out. No pressure, no bs. I was a bit skeptical about buying a car five hours away as I live in SoCal. I had my brother test drive the car I was looking for and he went to test drive it for me.

He test drove the vehicle and let me know of a few cosmetic issues typical with used cars and and gave the okay to buy it. Josh ended up getting me a better term with a different bank as opposed to the one I was planning on using.

Ended up catching a plane to San Jose to be at the dealer the day after and was there no more than two hrs. No pressure to buy add ons and Reza explained my financing in detail. You won't spend the whole day here, they value your time and will get you on your way. I highly recommend this dealer.< /review><user>102862697121734342801< /user><user_name>Jaime Espinoza<//user_name>< Rating>

I came in last week to test drive a Maserati Ghibli when I approached by a sales women I believe her name was Jasmine. She was extremly arrogant and rude. I asked her about the features and she knew NOTHING. She said I had to fill out a credit application before I cant drive the car.. UNBELIVEABLE what a great way to start your knew dealership. Needless to say I bought elsewhere and I don’t regret it one bit.< /Review>

This is what happens when average physical therapists get overhyped simply by having a nice facility. Genuienly hated this place and completely unable to help my injury as soon as it was realized this wasn't fiiting into the rountine surgeries like acl, which quite frankly most people can rehab on their own (but of course they put their success down to a PT). This place can't help you if you're genuinely struggling with something serious outside of regular surgery.</review>

<Review>I have been coming here since my surgery over 6 months ago. This is my second operation for the same injury, and I firmly believe if I had gotten this level of care after the first operation I may have been able to avoid the second surgery all together. Lauren and her team are knowledgeable, caring, and effective. I have recommended KIME to several friends and family members, and I won’t go anywhere else myself. Top notch all the way around.</Review>< Pics>

I have had physical therapy several times over the years since I moved to the area and this is by far the best experience I have had yet. Aaron and Heather are taking excellent care of me and their process seems like the best I have seen so far. With two new hips, I need all the help I can get and I am confident that I will get it here. 6 stars!</Review>

I’ve been taking my brother for PT the past several months and have nothing but praise for the staff at Kime. We always get a warm hello when we arrive and a have a great day when we leave. Working with Aaron and intern Justin for the summer was amazing. Not only did they get my brother back on his feet literally, they decided to get me working out too! We have a ways to go yet, but with the continued support of Kime we will get there. The combination of Mini’s House of Pain and Kime Physical Therapy couldn’t be more perfect. The entire staff of both along with their clients provide a welcome and encouraging environment to heal and grow in.<//review>

<review>I’ve dealt with Kime for several years. Directly after a surgery, for simple strains and other minor issues. Regardless of the challenge you are treated as the top priority. The thing I love the most and the reason I am always sending clients to them, is that they work to get you back in the game. Many PT clinics just go through the motions and keep you coming back. This group at Kime gets you better and more equipped so that moving forward you can have a better quality of life.

Thank you for always taking care of me and the people I’ve referred.

Barry C Williams.</review></record>

Personally, I’ll give Russ Dunning SIX stars! I have been lucky to have Russ help me over the last 10 years.....(s^** happens in your 60’s)! Knowledge is nice....but in rehabilitating my various “creaking” body parts....it has been a fresh approach to new and cutting edge training methodologies and protocols that has really impressed me. DISCOVERY is always a leading factor ....what can I do, what can I do to get there....not settling for “don’t do this or don’t do that’s” .

I have been going to Kime since June 2018 and I cannot day enough good things about them. I was referred to Kime by my Orthopedic Surgeon, Brandon Beamer (also amazing), for PT after my hip surgery. I wasn’t too sure what to expect as all of my prior experiences with PT have been sub-par to say the least.
From the first visit I was treated with compassion and respect from everyone. My physical therapist is Lauren (only Lauren unlike many other PT places) and she is absolutely amazing! She has been not only my physical therapist but she has been a source of motivation and encouragement and sometimes she’s my “therapist”. LOL
Lauren really listens to what I have to say and when I tell her things don’t feel right, she’s supportive. Even after my second hip surgery on the same hip, she was very supportive in my recovery (and still is).
I highly recommend Kime to anyone looking for a supportive and therapeutic environment.</review>

Always greeted by name and with big smiles. Professional PT staff, thanks Andrew, are also top notch. I had 2 people recommend KIME to me when they heard I had a shoulder issue. I ended up having my doctor change my referral as a result. I am glad I did, it's been nothing but positive experiences.< /text>

I was in a wheelchair for 2 months from an accident wherein I dislocated bones on my left arm and 2 fractures in my right foot.  Surgery was performed on my arm but the foot is still in the process of healing.  On my second visit to KIME, Tony owner and Physical Therapist, had me up out of the chair and I took my first steps since the accident. Honestly I was flowing with tears of joy inside and my soul was Jumping!   I am still healing and it’s a slow process and very emotionally draining at times.  What makes me hopeful is Kime;  not only do they offer outstanding “physical” therapy but they are also fantastic listeners and instill hope.  With hope brings healing.  I’d give them a perfect 10🌻</Text>

<Text>THIS IS THE ONE!  KIME Performance helped me recover from shoulder joint replacement surgery in Spring 2019 after nearly 20 years of suffering caused by a January 2000 mountain biking crash in the woods surrounding Folsom Lake.   I had visited other area physical therapists prior to this surgery and following other surgeries, but I never saw results like I experienced at KIME Performance.

While I know the joint replacement surgery itself was key, nearly every muscle in my upper body had wasted away from not being being able to exercise during the nearly 20 years since the crash.  The experienced care I received at KIME Performance (located in Mini's House of Pain) nursed my body back to life and helped make me a whole person again.  The simple exercises work and are easy to at home or any gym.  Some of the exercises are so much fun that I do them on the floor in the family room at home while watching TV with the family.

It was a long hard road to my salvation and I started going to my local gym multiple days a week once I was strong enough.  The time and sweat have been worth it for me.  Thank you to KIME Performance and Mini's House of Pain.< /Text>< Pics>

I tore my ACL and had two meniscus tears in October and immediately knew where to go for PT. Andrew is my therapist and he is so kind, knowledgeable and helping me to get back to an even better me than before. If you need a PT any of the Kime crew is 200% worth it!

I've been going to KIME to recover from a major knee injury and surgery (patellar tendon rupture). I rely on their expert experience to find the right balance at every phase of recovery. They started me out with slow and gentle tissue building and range of motion exercises, moving on to more aggressive challenges as I became able to handle it. I am on track to end up stronger than before the injury. I am very pleased with the progress!</review>

Can’t say enough amazing things about Russ! He is the best! I had a really hard case blowing out my knee while 7 months pregnant. He worked with me at getting my knee strong enough for delivering a baby and then working with me after I had mcl, acl and meniscus surgery 6 weeks after having a baby. I’m 10 weeks post op and already have 85% range of motion back and he has been amazing at giving me workouts to do to challenge me. Super thankful!</text>

KIME Performance helped me recover from my second back surgery.  I was able to go from constant pain to pain free and gain mobility in a short time span.  I now go to Mini's HOP 4 days a week and feel great!  The crew at KIME is top notch and always check in on me to see how I'm doing.</review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>KIME has been amazing for our son during his 4 month healing and recover process. There is nothing more agonizing as a parent than worrying how to adequately and smartly heal a young-student athlete after a significant injury.  However, Tony was wonderful and not only worked 1:1 with our son to develop a targeted healing and recovery plan, he gave homework, insights and support to ensure he was working even when at home.  They entire staff is friendly and helpful and we appreciate the flexible (and early) hours. We were fully committed to our sons recovery and drove 30 minutes down the hill before the sun because Tony and the KIME team were committed too! Now the journey re-begins with him being fully recovered hitting the ground strong, focused and healed! Thanks KIME!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

You never know what you are missing until you get it. Tony Mikla and the entire KIME Team are exceptional professionals. After living with pain for several years, and undergoing several surgeries I was referred to KIME. Words will never adequately express my gratitude to the dedication and care they have shown me. Tony is the fourth therapist to evaluate and treat my multiple complaints and the first one to elevate me from managing pain to truly living differently. He listens intently and treats accordingly. The results are beyond expectations. My pain decreased, I’m enjoying the activities I love, I’m sleeping better, I’ve reconnected with family and friends and I’m traveling without hesitation. KIME is simply THE BEST! Ive had the opportunity to work with each therapist in the EDH location and each one provides quality care and will work with you to get the best possible results. The front office is fantastic! I’m always greeted with a smile and wished well when I leave. The entire experience is different and may challenge your idea of what a PT / medical office should be, go with it. Could change your life.<//Review>

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! I have been fortunate enough to know Russ and Tony for over a year now, and they are the best physical therapists I have ever worked with. Coming into their care with severe back pain and spondylolisthesis, I was left pain free, as I have been for the past eight months. Their use of training in addition to physical rehab has allowed me to come back from my injury even stronger than I was previously. Never did I think I would be squatting and deadlifting nearly as much as I do today, and with continued improvement! They have dramatically changed my perspective on true strength and have given me the knowledge I constantly seek when it comes to the movement of the body. Once again, I highly recommend Kime Performance!</Review>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>I found them through my insurance list of PT providers and I'm so glad that I ended up with them.  I had an Achilles heel tendon rupture 8 weeks ago and after a few weeks of PT with Aaron, I have better mobility than expected at this stage.  Not only did he work on my ankle, but he had me work to fix the other parts of my body that may have contributed to the injury.  Aaron pushed me at the proper level and has been providing great care.  Kime is located within a small gym called Mini's House of Pain.  The setup is perfect since you havr access to all the equipment.  I wouls definitely recommend Kime PT for any type of physical therapy needs.  Of course, Aaron isn't the only PT and there are many other good and capable PTs.<//Text>< username>

<text>My wife and i both had major knee surgeries this year.  Mine was an acl and meniscus replacement, and hers was an acl replacement, mcl repair, and meniscus repair.  I wouldnt trust our recovery with anyone else in the area.  These guys are more about recovery than itemized billing.  They work on getting back to functional mivement, rather than letting a client sit for 15 mins. Icing with electric stim.

This place is AMAZING! The physical therapist, Strength Coach, Nutritionist, all KNOW what they are talking about and will develop you in so many ways unimaginable. They not only focus on your specific injury, but they work on the strength development of the entire body. One thing that is special to me about this place is how they all work as a collective to ensure that you leave better than you came! I worked with them for 7 months+ after a torn ACL/meniscus repair and I am STRONGER than I have ever been. This place changed my life and my perspective on my sport. The facility is always clean and well managed with enjoyable workout music in the background -I love it! If you get the chance to work with Tony, Russ, Tommy or Vince, consider yourself lucky - these men are literally the Gods of sports medicine. Ps.Tony Mikla is extremely patient and so kind,-he really changed my life. I am so thankful for his commitment to getting me back on the track!< /review>

<text>I have been to several physical therapists and none of them compare to KIME in competence, skills, and drive to get a person back to normal. Tony has done nothing short of a miracle to get me back on the field.

If you have to recover from an injury, the best chance you have is to go to KIME!!!</text><resp>{'time': 1542741657514, 'text': 'We are thrilled to hear your experience with our physical therapy program has worked out so well Chad.

<text>I wholeheartedly endorse Tony Mikla.  I am a marathon runner who was completely "broken" and could not walk when I first went to Tony for treatment.  Within 2 months he had me running 1 mile (with pain), but 6 weeks later I finished my 82nd marathon COMPLETELY pain-free for the entire 26.2 miles.... Simply UNBELIEVABLE!!!  He understood how important it was for my mental health to get me running again, even though it seemed like an impossibility to me!

He is always professional, kind and patient.  He is also a wonderful coach, teaching me strength training exercises, skills, etc. to incorporate into my everyday like to extend my running career.  Thanks to Tony, I just completed a pain-free 90th marathon!< /text><Time>1466816378984< /Time><Gmap_id>0x809af0118808a8e7:0xb784c054b6418276< /Gmap_id><response>{'time': 1542742105098, 'text': "Thank you for the amazing and honest words Carol.

Really fun place to go with a group. The beef noodle soup is excellent--deliciously seasoned fatty, tendon-y pieces of meat--soup dumplings are tasty, and greens were en pointe. Salt and pepper fried chicken had some crack breading.</review>

< Review>
The place was packed and there was a waitlist... so I do recommend getting on the waitlist prior to going in. We waited about 20 minutes before we were seated. Staff was friendly and I didn't feel bad about the kids being a little loud since it was a great environment for that.<//Review>

< Review>
The food I ordered were heavily seasoned with MSG.  The hot & sour soup tasted like it had soap in it.  The black bean noodle didn't taste right.  I have been a regular customer there for a long time but it seems the MSG was the main ingredient for most of the dishes.  My wife got sick right after eating their food and my mouth was really dry due to MSG.  We ordered 6 dishes but had to toss them out.  Please be sure to tell them no MSG in any dishes.   The customer service was great but the food was salty and MSG is used for flavoring but has been associated with various forms of toxicity.  It's unhealthy to consume MSG.</Review>

I loved all the delicious meals I ate. The cucumber salad was also really good and sightly tangy. Small place, fast service and great food. If it was closer to where I live I would definitely be a regular.</Text>

Tried to do a pickup via BeyondMenu but they don't support that anymore. They called me up and I ordered a Sheng Jian Bao (生煎包) and Steamed Veg Dumplings over the phone - wasn't disappointed! Nice thick dough and loads of fresh filling for the veg dumpling. Very substantial - will definitely come back. Nancy at the counter was nice too!<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>This place is crazy! Like, crazy good!

They don’t have a huge menu, but what they do have is incredible. The staff are super friendly, and they’re open until 2am which, once again, is crazy!

I picked up both the Shanghai Steamed Vegetarian and Pork Dumplings, Vegetarian Shumai and Potstickers, Shrimp and Pork Wontons, and the steamed sweet buns.
The Shanghai Steamed Pork Dumplings are some of the best soup dumplings I’ve ever had, and the vegetarian ones were hands down the best I’ve ever had. The Shumai wasn’t my favorite, but that’s just a preference.

Give this place a shot! It’s a great deal, you won’t be disappointed.< /Text>< user_name>

All the food is great and prices are reasonable for the bay. We took some pretty unadventurous eaters here and they loved all the traditional dishes! Definitely recommend all the dumplings. Personally, Xiao Long Bao isn't my favorite but I will say they were quite good here, so it's a good place to go if you wanna try some good ones.</Review>

Amazing food here, stopped by for lunch and just barely avoided the rush of people that arrived which was a blessing. Everything was so delicious, can see why it’s so popular here, will definitely be returning next time I’m in the area. Highly recommend A++< /Review>

We got some fried dumplings, xlb, shanghai noodle, and chili oil wonton. The only thing that was worth it was the xlb. Everything else was pretty flavorless or overly oily (I'm sadly looking at you, noodles). The vinegar they have on the side is tasty though.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFKvb8ZiXjgMzOT5ZsS2eWHpQmEq2um2TUqvDw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOB5Cmp7ZC9QbJcM78eBpxmMPllTlK_KHETKON-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8n7px54RV81Evjl4ATKjqRepuzmSXDMJZNKOs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYRdP3Jlh--_sniqxqq0GW87QQDApUco6uADiT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Resp>

<time>1558073852489< /time><Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Searching through the city on Christmas day to see what was open and found this place! (I know most people think that all Chinese restaurants are open Christmas day but surprisingly some of them were closed in the area).

Really convenient that you can put yourself on the yelp waitlist because you'll be pretty squished if you want to wait inside because there isn't much of a waiting area, and it's pretty warm when it's crowded.

To start of the meal, got soymilk and sticky rice rolls. Sticky rice rolls were wrapped in plastic and cut. Good amount of dried pork and fried bread inside inside the roll. Also tried the potstickers, crab XLB, and shanghai fried noodles. The XBL and potstickers have thick skin, so if you aren't a fan of that, this place might not be the place for you. Potstickers were fried nicely on the bottom and the meat was juicy inside! Crab XLB had tender, fresh juicy meat inside with flavorful broth. Noodles were thick cut, chewy and delicious!

Overall decent chinese dumpling place, parking can be a pain to find in this area, so be prepared!</Review>< pictures>

< review>
Catching up on my reviews Pre Covid!

Food: 4/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 3/5
Overall: A good option for Shanghainese dumplings

The extended review...

Food:

Soup Dumplings: 4/5 - Juicy and meaty like most

Snow Pea Shoots: 4/5 - My favorite Chinese vegetable with a tender yet crunchy bite

Beef and Sting Beans: 4/5 - A good option when you want meat and veggies in the same dish

Shanghainese Rice Cake: 4/5 - Who doesn't like rice cake!?  It's a nice substitute for noodles and I love the chewiness of it.

Ambiance: Standard fair when it comes to Chinese restaurants

Service:  Same as the ambiance</review>

Food was pretty good. Super filling, definitely ordered too much. They'e open all day without and closures in the middle. Good place to go if you're having a late lunch and all the other places are closing soon.</review>

They had great reviews and came over immediately. Inside was pretty small, but had a decent amount of tables. Inside was clean and bright. We ordered the xiao long bao, braised tofu with veggies, chicken chow mein, pan fried pork buns, and fried bread with condensed milk.

The xiao long baos were great; they were cooked perfectly and the soup inside tasted so good. The pan fried buns were super hot when we got them, but cooked really good. The chow mein portion was huge, and tasted pretty good. The braised tofu was amazing as well, would definitely recommend this dish. The fried buns with condensed milk was a great dessert to finish the meal.

I really like that they have the yelp waitlist, as there's almost no space inside for waiting parties. The food is great and always fresh. Definitely a new go-to place for dumplings.< /review>< Date>

Very good price (3 piece $2.85) although you need to line up quite a while. I had shrimp dump., stickey rice, pork bun. They were all sooo tasty. You can also choose your dimsum and take out.< /review>

I believe that they are under new ownership and can take credit card.  You can also check-in via Yelp which is awesome, since I hate standing in line to wait for food.

The food was really good here and reasonably priced.  We ordered green onion pancake, some dumplings, and stir fried noodles with rice cakes and was happy with all of our choices. I don't think you can go wrong with all the meat and carb choices!<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>We arrived just after opening and there was no wait. 15 minutes later there was a line out the door. It's a testament to their well made, juicy XLB and other dumplings and buns. I had a sticky rice roll and the savoury hot soy milk. Both were excellent versions of Shanghai/Taiwanese breakfast/snack foods.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f7d835ad0d52f:0x61768a5c80a9e9dc</Gmap_id></record>

<review>Really good xiao long bao, potstickers, pan friend pork buns (all of which are best eaten there, over takeout). Also love their fried noodles. Clean- esp compared to many other SF dumpling places, friendly service.</review>< Pics>

<Time>1597796595743<//Time><Rating>5</Rating><review>Delicious! Had the Shanghai style steamed pork dumplings, wonton in chili sauce and Shanghai style chow mein. The wonton was good, but I would more highly recommend the dumplings and chow mein. Service was good too. I called in the order, and it took about 25 minutes to get it. (The food was ready in 15-20, but I had to wait in line outside a little bit to pick up the food.)< /review>< pics>

Fresh looking foods, not so much spicy and heavy foods but are extremely healthy and fresh. The restaurant looks very nice, I love to spend more time there whenever I go. Sometimes I like to take my friends with me. Also good for bringing friends.</review>

You get a big order piping fresh with incredible flavor and consistency for very little $.  Right up there with anything I've had in China.  The rest of the menu is also phenomenal.  Particularly recommend the Shanghai Noodles, Pork with Leeks, and their Green Beans.  Now under new ownership but same great taste and value.  Can't recommend strongly enough!< /review>< date>

<Text>Dumpling Kitchen is a hidden gem among the SF Sunset District! Came across this place when finding good restaurants to eat with my friends. We were craving Xiao Long Bao 小籠包, known as the soup dumpling and happen to have found one around the area. Not too long of a wait, since we found that they also do Yelp Waitlist! Keep in mind that this restaurant only accepts debit card or cash unfortunately but luckily most people carry a debit card at least! Great to support a family owned business!

My friends and I ordered the A1. Xiao Long Bao that came with 10 soup dumplings. Definitely recommend dipping the soup dumplings in vinegar and a little soy sauce if you like a little base to the vinegar. We also ordered the Shanghai Chow Mein and the Pea Sprout Veggies, a classic Chinese vegetable dish that goes great with Xiao Long Baos. Xiao Long Baos were delicious as you pop them into your mouth and the flavor and soup explode inside with the tender meat wrapped up as a surprise. The Shanghai Chow Mein was fantastic since I love noodles and the noodles were thick with chicken and vegetables mixed into it. And finally the Pea Sprout Veggies are a classic vegetable dish to fill up your tummy with savory goodness.

The servers are super friendly and helped suggest popular dishes for us, and speak English, Cantonese Chinese. or Mandarin Chinese. Price was super affordable and cheap! I’ll definitely come back with family and friends to support this local community business!<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnjAPkh4ZWytJn1Qirt-r2xdmmqAqqrzOHdRWj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJG3l0pva-xaRxfws_-1YCvl3ZTpfWYWjhgzsy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-u1vxsqkfeDAhNVAzjG2oDIsdudtSI_Rn7yeB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

Pretty solidly good food - friend and I went to lunch and ordered 4 dishes.  The hot and sour soup was pretty tasty.  The Shanghai style dumpling with soup in the middle was better than average but certainly not comparable to ones at Din Tai Fung.  Prices were a littler higher than you might expect, but the place is nice/clean and service was attentive.  Read that this place gets crowded so we went at about 2PM on a weekday and place was mostly empty :)

Biggest downer is the place does NOT take credit cards.  We may opt to go to other similar restaurants next time that do take credit cards.<//Review>

Seated immediately on a Saturday night. Food came out quickly. Pan fried pork buns, wontons in chili oil, and the Shanghai-style steamed pork buns (Xiao long baos) are great. The pork and shrimp shu Mai and pea sprouts with garlic are just ok. Green onion pancake is disappointing.</Review>

They reopen, and I burn my lips because them pan fried buns was too hot!!! But well worth it.

So glad they reopened, didn't have much good Chinese food options with Hong Kong lounge set on fire.< /Review>

<review>Yummy dumplings, nice small place for Chinese food. They have a good variety of vegetarian options. Chow mein,  dumplings, pot stickers, garlic string beans. They have a good variety of soups and noodle dishes including veggie options. Would definitely go here again.< /review><user>104938141067258241678< /user>< Pics>

<text>Definitely a hidden gemstone. Looks can be descending, great place to buy fried catfish and fries. It looks a bit ghetto with bullet proof glass all around the store but the people are friendly. I recommend calling your order ahead.< /text></record>

Wantons in chili oil. Yummy!
Update: these guys are great, the take out is ready within 15-20 minutes to pick up - we've tried everything vegetarian on the menu, and it has all been delicious. My favorite: hot and sour soup and onion pancake.</review>

Amazing dumplings and spring rolls, quick and friendly service. Place is pretty crowded and noisy, but it only improves the atmosphere. Payed ~$35 for 2 very hungry persons (2 types of dumplings and 1 spring roll portion), which is kinda affordable for SF. Extremely highly recommended since food was much better than we had in Chinatown in the city.< /Text>

I'd love to say I got to enjoy the food, but this has to be the first time I've felt discriminated against at an Asian restaurant. What is the point of having signing into Yelp and waiting in line if they're going to let Asian people that sign in after, get a table before us. The manager called our name and was going to sit us down when the hostest gave our table to a different couple.

Maybe one couple is fine or an accident, but two different couple? When I spoke to the manager he seemed sympathetic, but the hostess came over and clearly didnt want us there as she argued with me and the manager. I lost my appetite and my desire to eat at this restaurant.</Text>

Really good dumplings. They have the fried Shanghai dumplings that pretty much no other restaurant in SF has and they were super legit. The wonton with chili oil was just ok and the spicy fish was pretty good. The main thing to go for is the various Shanghai dumplings for sure. Best I've had in SF!</review>

#1 dumplings are absolutely amazing. Also must try the Shanghai rice cake dish. Potstickers are great too. we haven't found a dish yet that we haven't liked, although we usually stick to the ones we know and just try one new dish each time.</text>

Very consistent xlb. $8.50 for a basket of 10! The broth is on the sweeter side. The skin dries out very quickly and will taste doughy. You just have to eat it quickly! Also highly recommend their give spice beef stew noodle. Lots of beef and spinach- not a skimpy portion at all!</review>

Our usual dumpling place is Kingdom of Dumplings, but I wanted to try a new place.  We showed up around 2 pm on a Saturday and the place was pretty packed.  We got a table quickly.  The menu of stir fried items surpassed that number of possible dumpling combinations.  This place strictly has pork dumplings, not chicken and limited to cabbage filling.  We got several dishes; thread pulled fried bread, chicken and spinach noodle soup, twice cooked  pork belly with leek, Shanghai steamed dumplings, and fish in black bean sauce.  My daughter ate most of the fried bread, you dip in condense milk which gives it bit of sweetness.  The Shanghai dumplings were ok, not too great.  The chicken and spinach noodle soup was very flavorful and the noodles chewy.  All the dishes were sold and good.  Looking around, people came here and ordered very different dishes.  Someone had a plate of chicken wings that looked really good, so I'm going to try that next time we go back.</review>

I’ve been here several times and they serve consistently delicious Dim Sum. Don’t be put off if you see a line to get in - it moves pretty quickly and it’s well worth the wait!</text>

<Text>I'd give it 5 stars for the food, but the service has much to be desired.  Better order everything the first time you order because they have no patience for you if you order more!  The soup dumplings are the best EVER!!  There is nothing like drinking the soup from the top of the dumpling and then savoring the perfectly mixed meat and seasonings.  Have it with the dried string beans and you're in dumpling heaven!  Usually a long wait, but well worth it!</Text>< pics>

<Text>Food was very good and good portion for a fair price. We had 5 people and ordered three orders of xiao long bao (10 pieces each order), dry fried string beans, garlic eggplant, and braised pork belly with preserved vegetables, and two bowls of rice (a pet peeve of mine as rice usually comes complementary with meal!). All for a little over $70.00 not including tip. We even had leftovers to take home. The wait can be long if you aren't there early. But you can sign in on Yelp wait list and be notified by text when your table is available.<//Text>< user>

This was a favorite lunch and dinner stop for dumplings and pot stickers on Taraval. Take the L  if you don't feel like walking. It's located close to Pacific and beach access. Simple decor. I didn't try other dishes on the menu. It was fun to watch the dumplings  being made in local shop windows during my morning run in the Taraval area.</review>

It's a casual family place.  No need to dress up.  That old sweatshirt and blue jeans you haven't changed out of for days are just fine.  All that really matters is you get down here, wait a bit, and then have some scrumptious SF dumpling fare.

Yah.  Excellent dumplings.  Noodle soups we had were good too though the pork noodle soup was seriously lacking pork.

And, they are open Thanksgiving Day.  How cool is that.  Wait was not too bad for the two of us but clearly others had the same great idea to come here for a nice meal.< /Review>

Usually not crowded but it seems to be developing a loyalty. Formerly accepted cards but now cash only.

Great always busy as is right. Ever so slightly pricey, but made on the spot. I made the assumption that 'dumpling' meant dim sum. I was corrected with a V-brow frown: this is northern China, not south!< /Text>

Good food overall. Would have gotten 5 stars if the fried pork buns weren't a bit heavy on the dough at the top, which made them somewhat dry. The Shanghai dumplings could have been juicier too, but that's nitpicking. No complaints about the wonton soup.
Would go there again, esp with no wait on a Friday night.<//Review>

My friend found this place while looking for a place to get some lunch. We weren't expecting much, but whatever we ordered was absolutely delicious. The place wasn't packed during lunch time, and parking was easy as well. Very convenient. We ordered dumplings, pancake, and some a dish that's somewhere between dumplings and chinese bun. I'm not even kidding. It taste just like that! They pan grilled the dumplings until the bottom part is a bit crispy, and make it tastier. Seriously though. If you're running out of lunch places this is a good place to try out.<//review><Time>1392778873953<//Time><Name>Ivan Yudhi<//Name></record>

Didn't feel like it was anything special - the dumplings were a bit bland and all started to blend together despite being different things. I heard someone raving about the chicken wings, so I insisted that my table try them and I felt that there are better elsewhere. Also, it was one of the hottest days in recent history in SF and I asked for water with ice - I had to ask twice, and I got room temperature water. I usually wouldn't consider it a huge issue but the table next to me also asked for ice water and received it.

The place is cash/debit card only so be prepared!</text>

The dumplings were good and don't pop open when you try to pick them up with the chopsticks.

I had the green onion pancake which seems to be a popular choice (a lot of other tables had it) but I would not order it again. It didn't really have a taste and was very dry.</text>

<Text>Visited the restaurant for lunch, not too crowded at around 2:30 pm. Our group ordered a few different types of dumplings, twice cooked pork belly, and some noodles. Service was just okay. After being seated, seems like the service staff was taking a short break. Food order came out quickly. Once our food got to our table the service staff hardly came around. Had to wave them down for more water. Food is good, service is lacking.</Text>< user>

PROS - Delicious and tasty, shanghainese dumplings are fresh and to die for, cozy place, reasonable service and price.

CONS - Very hard to find parking, bathroom needs improvement, don't come on weekends...very long wait.

Overall an outstanding experience.  I've had shanghainese dumplings all around the world and this place ranks up there.  The noodle dishes are very authentic in flavor and freshly made.< /Text>

<Review>I can't really speak for the meat dumplings, but they have amazing vegetarian dumplings.  The fried rice isn't great.  Other than that, I've liked everything I've tried so far.  The cleanliness of the restaurant is not perfect.  The food is served very quickly.  It has become one of the favorite take out places in my office.</Review>< pics>

I've been coming here for years.  Highlights are soup dumplings, pan fried pork buns, Shanghai chow mein, and Shanghai rice cakes. The food is excellent,  but if I were to offer one suggestion,  it would be to request that the stir fry dishes be a little less salty.</Review>

<Review>Note: Street parking. We were lucky and found a parking spot nearby in the local neighborhood.

PROs:
* The food is pretty good. We got dumplings, green onion pancake, and vegetarian noodles. The green onion pancake was a bit different than what I've had as a kid; it's fluffier and made with the same dough (or similar) as the dumplings.
* Service is prompt. After sitting down and ordering, the food came out pretty quickly. The waiters were vigilant with refilling the teapot.
* The price is fair for the amount and given the location.

CONs:
* The restaurant is small, so there's almost always a wait.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Went here for dinner the other night and it was pretty good. The Braised Lions Head Meatball's texture did not feel like it was fresh. But other than that the whole place was amazing. The service was ok and the food was amazing. The shaghai dumplings are the best thing that they have there. Highly Recommend it!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

We tried the soup dumpling, pan fried bao, pork belly, and wonton noodle soup. I think out of them all, the noodle from the wonton soup was the best. The noodle was very fresh. Everything else was just ok.< /Review>

I was wondering what to eat for lunch Tuesday. Weather was sunny but a little bit chilly. I remembered I haven't had dumplings for a long time so I decided to pay Dumpling Kitchen a visit. Started off with a Nice and warm soy milk and complimentary roasted peanuts. Dumpling xiao long bao was warm with juicy sauce in the middle. When you eat it be careful because the inside is very hot. Make sure you drink the soup while eating the dumplings. The rice cake noodles dish with chewy with shredded pork and veges. I also ordered a sweet rice roll for dessert later. All for only around $20 and there was leftovers for Togo too. Very yummy and satisfying.﻿<//Text>

<user_id>114423743672147906343<//user_id><text>Since Kingdom of Dumpling doesn't open until 11 or 11:30 on Sundays, we walked down the street until we stumbled upon Dumpling Kitchen.

Shanghai soup dumplings were done surprisingly well here and from what I recall, the price point is a tad lower too, so you get ten squishy balls of joy for $8. The wrapper was just right since you could see the pork through it, but no soup leakage at all!

I loved their version of Shanghai style fried noodles, partially because of the excellent portion size. Getting the dumplings and the noodle dish was more than enough for two hungry dudes.

Would love to try their egg puffs next time.

Wish they had vinegar handy on the tables!</text>< GmapID>

<Review>Cash only place. Long wait sometimes so make reservation on yelp online. We were seated within few mins because we made reservations. We ordered gyozas, pork buns, pork and crab dumpling and chicken noodles. In my opinion crab didnt go too well with pork and chiken noodles were pretty standard but the gyozas and the pork buns were just amazing. They were one of the best ones around the area. I cant wait to try other stuff from their menu<//Review>< gmapID>

<review>I love dumplings, and this was the next place on my dumpling bucket list in the city. There were two of us, and we ordered the Shanghai dumplings, the pork dumplings in chili oil and the pork and napa cabbage dumplings.

Shanghai dumplings: Good texture, with a good amount of soup inside, but to me, the flavor was lacking.

Pork dumplings in chili oil: Again, the texture of these was great - perfectly steamed. The flavor of the dumpling was good, but the chili oil that comes on the table was better than the oil that the dumplings were cooked in. They did, however, include slices of raw garlic which gave the dish a pretty good kick to it.

Pork and napa cabbage: These were my favorite. Really good flavor and texture, and went really well with the chili oil on the table.

While these weren't my favorite dumplings in the city, I would come back again because the food was decent, service was fast and the meal was cheap (a little over $20!). I did see someone eating beef noodle soup and would try that next time I go.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><user_id>112444094149673294405< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

There was a line at lunch on this lunar new year and it was worth the wait. Tea came quickly and the service was friendly, helpful, and fairly efficient, despite the packed restaurant.

In addition to veg steamed dumplings and scallion pancakes (both still winners, though the scallion pancake isn't really good value), we tried the mu shu vegetable.

The mu shu vegetable (without egg) came on a big oval plate with little pieces of broccoli in addition to the more standard veggies. I felt so lucky! We received six pancakes and I appreciated that they were thick and therefore didn't break, as so many do at other Chinese restaurants. The hoison sauce was thick and tasty, so the whole package was good and yummy.<//review>< user_name>

<Review>Nice spot for dumplings and some Chinese food. Come early if you don't want to wait for a table since the place isn't big.<//Review><user_id>116380292584882525756<//user_id>< Gmap_id>

Ordered the burnin Brock and the breakfast sausage hot dog. The internet and overall ambiance of the restaurant felt hip and classy. Service was friendly and fairly fast!

Was not a fan of the Burnin Brock. The chicken sausage was really dry and crumbly. Furthermore, felt like the fried avocado didn't really compliment the flavor and vibe of the hot dog. On the other hand, the breakfast sausage was juicy and delicious. I love the toppings and the duck egg was a great addition. Furthermore, the buns here are outstandingly soft and they have a wide selection of beers that are worth checking out!

I don't recommend coming during lunch time, came here for the curry fries and sausage platter but they don't serve those until 5pm. Will revisit to try those two dishes again!</Text>

<Review>Was ok. They accept only cash or debit cards. The problem was that I had to enter my pin code when ready for  payment, but the young man didn't understand English. He kept telling me "card don't work", while I told him that I need to enter the pin code. He (with quite an angry face) called another waitress and things got sorted.<//Review>< pictures>

My favorite dumpling place in San Francisco! The soup dumplings, the Shanghai panfried dumplings, and the pork in Napa cabbage dumplings are the best.

No wonder why property prices in Golden Gate Heights, the inner Sunset, Parkside, and West portal or just on fire now!  this area has the best, most affordable food in all of San Francisco.< /review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>The xlb (Xiao long bao) here we're pretty good. The skin is thinner than most in the Bay area but not as thin as Din Tai Fung. It had a good amount of soup to meat ratio. The only negative I can say about the XLB is that the meat consistentcy was a bit too soft.

The wait was about 15-20 at 130 on a weekend. Quick service and the food come out fast too. Other dishes were ok.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

We had a pretty large group here last night for a couple of friends' birthdays. For the value, Dumpling Kitchen was pretty good. It's no Michelin star restaurant but a satisfying combination of price, portion, and flavor.

XLB - The skins were way better than I expected at this price point. Their texture was smooth with the right amount of firm chewiness. Just from looking at them, the fine folds at the top was a good sign that the skins would be thin and delicate. They also didn't break open when picked up with chopstick. Not much to complain about there. The stuffing was not the best but still decent for a low end restaurant. The texture of the pork was on the grittier side, and I thought it could've had more ginger and green onions mixed in for more brightness. The broth was similar to the pork stuffing in that it could be brighter and bolder, but it still had good body and was seasoned with enough salt . The broth was also on the fattier side, which doesn't bother me, but I know some people out there prefer cleaner XLB broths.

Braised Pork Belly with Pickled Vegetables - You can tell this restaurant probably isn't run by Shanghainese people because of kitchen staff yelling at each other in Cantonese, and this is reflected in some of the menu items. This braised pork belly dish is a traditional Hakka classic from southern China, far from Shanghai. Dumpling Kitchen's rendition is actually pretty good. The pork belly was tender, and the sauce was a good balance of sweetness and pickled earthiness. My favorite place to order this is at Hakka Restaurant in the Outer Richmond. If I had to compare the two, Hakka's sauce is thicker and richer with a more complex spice mixture. There's a slight orange peel flavor in Hakka's that separates it from the rest. Despite not being as good as Hakka's, I would have no qualms with getting the pork belly here.

Green Onion Pancakes - Not really my cup of tea. They have the lighter and fluffier version of green onion pancakes, and I didn't think it had much green onion flavor. It kinda just tasted doughy. The crispy and layered green onion pancakes are way better.

Vegetarian Potstickers - There was a vegetarian in our group so we had an order of vegetarian potstickers. I was kinda surprised because they turned out to be pretty tasty. I probably liked them more than the pork and chive dumplings. There's a good amount of shiitake mushrooms to give it a lot of umami and earthy flavors. They also put in dried tofu (doufu gon), and it's firmer texture and five spice flavor paired well with the other ingredients in the stuffing.

Noodles with Black Bean Sauce - Not good. Sauce was not very savory and didn't taste black bean-y. Noodles were mushy and gross. Skip this.

Egg Puffs (Sah Yong) - Freshly fried and really delicious. They were light, airy, and full of eggy goodness. If I had to complain about something, it's that instead of surrounding the donuts in sugar, it's just poured all on top of the donuts. I just rolled the donut around to get the sugar everywhere.< /review>

Can go wrong with their crab or pork xiao loung bao - delightful and delicious. Their Shanghai fried nian gao is pretty awesome. The Sheng jian bao and pot stickers taste almost the same, so I'll be sure to order just one or the other next time. The green onion pancake is deep fried and not pan fried, so I won't order that again either. Red chili wontons were okay, but I've had better. All of these negatives drop the star off in my book. Would definitely give the dumplings 5 stars though. They stand up to any other dumpling place I've been, including din tai fung!</Review>< pics>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>OMG...   The "Shanghai Style pan fried pork bun" is dim-Yum!!  Absolute perfection.  The bottom has a delightful crispy crunch to it, the sides are like rice noodle the filling is juicy like soup dumplings and the top is fluffy like pork bun... AMAZING.  One of the top dishes in our city.

XLB dumplings were good but a little too oily.  Very good but not as good as Shanghai House which in my mind has the best in the city.  Pan fried pork buns are better in my mind.

Shanghai style chow mein was very good with very chewy noodles. A little bit more oily than I like and not enough wok-hei flavor but it was good. (especially with their awesome salty roasted chili oil)<//text>< pics>

<name>Grace G<//name><review>Delightful little hole in the wall offering delicious Xiao Long Bao (Shanghainese soup dumplings) and Chinese breakfast all at the same time!

As much as you want to order a bit of everything, get the xiao long bao for sure. Maybe even two. It pairs well with a glass of warm sweet soy milk and other side dishes - pan fried dumplings, pea shoots, chinese donuts, Shanghainese stir-fried (thick) noodles etc.</review><Time>1407724258474<//Time><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

A clean, friendly choice amongst the dumpling contenders out in Sunset / Parkside. The beijing style pork & chive dumplings and wontons in house broth are both great. Homemade and comforting. The pea vines with garlic are light and fresh. The Shanghai noodles and xiao long bao (little soup dumplings) can be skipped. Plus, they take credit cards!<//Review>

The Shanghai steamed pork dumplings were what my family came for and they were super delicious. We also ordered the shanghai chow mein, chinese doughnut, soy milk, and other dumplings. This place has a long wait but the food is very worth it. The service is a typical chinese restaurant but the place gets packed so come early.</review>

We put our names down, and were told 10-15 minutes. A few minutes later we were asked if we were okay with sharing a table. "Sure!" was our answer. We sat with two women, they had ordered a ton of food, so there was no need for any food ordering shame for me.

We ordered:

XLB Shanghai-style steamed pork dumplings (10pcs) - they were DELICIOUS!!!
Shanghai-style pan-fried pork buns (8pcs) - Meh, would not order these again
Pork dumplings in chili oil (10pcs) - YUM. Wontons in sesame chili oil.
Shanghai-style green onion pancake - YUM! Crispy, onions, light, fluffy!!!
Beijing-style sweet buns (4pcs) - Meh. We ordered steamed but got fried. Even still, just meh.

This is a good place for 4 or more people to come and dine with portion sizing. We ordered way too much food so that we could try a bunch of things. We'd definitely share a table again, just hopefully not the round table at the back (my hubs had to get up 3 times so the food delivery hand truck could make it to the kitchen). Parking wasn't too bad, we found a spot a long block away (and definitely needed the walk after our big meal).< /Review>< Pics>

First time here at Dumpling Kitchen. Came with a party of 20, my family took two large table in their small sized resturant. The shiaghai dumpling were delicious. Hot, stemay soup pocuhe dumplings. The potstickers were also very good. We aslo ordered and loved, the fish in spicy soup, pan fried boa, soy milk, and green beans. I do not recommed the loin's head meatball dish, came tasteless and mushy. Overall very postivite expereince. Fair prices, and good fast service. Yes, I would recommend.</Text>

(Translated by Google) There are a lot of people, the fried buns are ok, the red oil dumplings and boiled fish are completely unauthentic, but the whole is relatively real

人多，生煎包可以，红油水饺和水煮鱼完全不正宗，但是整体还比较实在< /review>

(Translated by Google) Perfect Chinese restaurant! Family atmosphere and very clean. Staff attentive and friendly. Delicious and authentic Chinese food. I suggest ordering the chicken soup with corn. Spectacular!

Restaurante chinês perfeito! Ambiente familiar e muito limpo. Funcionários atenciosos e simpáticos. Comida deliciosa e autêntica da China. Sugiro pedirem a sopa de frango com milho. Espetacular!</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) A year ago review: Drunk chicken and Xiaolongbao are okay, quality and quantity are in retreat. Tips can be given 15 ~ 20%, stars can only be given three.
New Year's Day 2020 review: Both quality and price have been improved. Shanghai Shengjianbao has a lot of flavor and flavor, and the soft onion oil cake is suitable for the elderly. Several others are also satisfied. So starred!

(Original)
一年前的评论：醉鸡和小笼包还可以，质和量在退㱑中。小费可以给15~2O%，星只能给三粒。
2020年元旦的评论：质量和价格都有提高，上海生煎包味香汁多，葱油饼松软很适合老年人牙口。其他几样也都满意。故此加星！</review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Yummy!
Have thoroughly enjoyed the food.
The lettuce was served a little too hot, but it fitted well with the dish!

(Original)
Lekker!
Heb goed genoten van het eten.
De sla was iets te warm geserveerd, maar het paste wel goed bij het gerecht!< /Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) We came here because we were looking for a dumping restaurant. In terms of name, we thought we were right here. Unfortunately there were 6 dumping dishes on the menu. Then about 180 other Chinese dishes.
There was no deviation from the card, so you could not order mixed dumping.
The food was ok in terms of taste, but it didn't knock the 4 of us out of our socks. Payment was only in cash. Credit card is not possible.
Unfortunately, our two women felt sick with stomach ache all day after, so we assume that not everything was ok there.

Even the name "Dumping Kitchen" did not deserve it due to the poor selection. (See photo-> The part of the menu with the dumplings)
Despite everything the staff was very friendly and helpful.
We would not go there again.

Wir sind hier hin gekommen, da wir ein Dumping Restaurant gesucht haben. Dem Namen nach dachten wir hier richtig zu sein. Leider gab es auf der Karte ganze 6 Dumping Gerichte. Dann noch ca. 180 andere chinesische Gerichte.
Ein Abweichen von der Karte gab es nicht, man konnte also keine gemischte Dumping bestellen.
Das Essen war geschmacklich ok, hat uns 4 aber nicht aus den Socken gehauen. Bezahlen ging nur in Bar. Kreditkarte geht nicht.
Leider war unseren beiden Frauen den ganzen Tag danach Übel mit Bauchschmerzen, daher gehen wir davon aus, das dort nicht alles ok war.

Auch den Namen "Dumping Kitchen", hat es in Anbetracht der mageren Auswahl nicht verdient. (Siehe Foto-> Der Teil der Speisekarte mit den Dumplings)
Trotz allem das Personal war sehr freundlich und hilfreich.
Wir würden nicht noch einmal dort hin gehen.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< rate>
